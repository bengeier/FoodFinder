{"text":"Everything was really good. We loved the salsa bar with all the interesting choices.  Carne asada tacos were great. Can't wait to come back and try the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Lord have mercy, this place is in strong contention for best downtown Mexican food. Strong drinks and fresh, delicious food at very reasonable prices. When you tire of Macayos and all the other cheap knockoffs, get your soon-to-be-chubbier behind to La Santisima."}
{"text":"This is one of the best (if not the best) places for tacos in the Phoenix area. We've tried several different tacos and quesadillas and everything has been delicious. It's also the closest I've seen to authentic Mexican in Phoenix. The variety of salsas makes it fun to eat these dishes."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. Yes.  Anybody who does not give this restaurant a 5 is a food critic who's just trying to take down one of the best taco shops in America!  We were so excited when this place moved over to the west side closer to our house.  Try to quesadillas and the horchata."}
{"text":"Amazing place wish i lived in Phx so i could have this EVERYDAY!"}
{"text":"A wonderful salsa bar with more than ten different kinds of salsa. I was seated and given a basket of chips but I had no clue where the salsa was till I saw people queuing at the backside of the room.
I had ordered tacos and they came out delicious wit the sides. The food is good but the service sucks.
The place gets very crowded in the evening even on non weekends so need to plan ahead if you are going with a big group.
5 stars for the excellent food and the salsa spread, will visit again if I'm in phoenix"}
{"text":"this was our second time going to the restaurant food is great but the service is so bad we will not be returning again the first time we just thought had a bad server so we returned a second time and found out its always like this service is horrible will not recommend it to anyone because of the service and my 4 year old daughter was served her tacos on a broken plate"}
{"text":"I hadn't been there in quite some time but went for lunch on Monday. Amazing! Had the chicken mole quesa which tasted great and was more than enough for lunch and dinner that night. Also had a salad which was really good. I'll go back often!"}
{"text":"Truly superb food. Service is...quirky-- you need to order at the counter and grab your own utensils. Locals know the ropes, so the newbies have to figure it out on their own. But if you want an authentic, neighborhood feel, and excellent food, this is your place."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! Shark tacos were really good. Their horchata was amazing! Must try, it had strawberry, pecan, and melon I believe. Will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"Oh, I dream about the salsas here... I love all the different combinations, and could very easily make a meal with those alone. Love the tacos and the horchata as well."}
{"text":"Nothing even close in Denver.  I may move to Phoenix over these tacos.  And the service, hilarious and amazing. Highly recommended!  Pretty sweet artwork as well, and top notch salsa. You will not go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love their salsa bar and the quaint environment. They don't skimp on the serving sizes either. The tacos always have large portions of meat and fixings. It's one of my favorite places to take out of town visitors. They are always impressed and satisfied. Oh, and the horchata is the best I've ever had. Yes!"}
{"text":"Well cross that one off the list....

We went in looking forward to giving the new neighborhood taco spot a shot. Read solid reviews and thought we could add a new dining spot to our rotation. Wrong.

Not only was it a billion degrees inside, the flies were everywhere! The service was adequate (given the volume of customers) but the food was...well, sub par. Not horrible...just not very good. The famed salsa bar turned out to be a few Tupperware tubs of salsa that tasted remarkably similar to the selection available at Pro's Ranch Market.

We're gonna head back over to America's next time we've got a taste for tacos."}
{"text":"La Santisima has a great variety of Mexican foods from many different regions of mexico, with a depth and richness of flavor that is absolutely amazing. Their happy hour is extraordinarily reasonable, but one of my favorite things is the salsa bar. Around 20 salsas with a variety of flavors and ingredients, from a pecan salsa, to old standbys like pico de gallo. I would highly recommend this restaurant to ANYONE, and have brought folks visiting from out of town. Everyone agrees, this is the best of the best.

P.S. The place is definitely cozy. I would recommend coming in during happy hours if you are trying to avoid a crowd."}
{"text":"This was an interesting place. I was craving tacos and what's better than going to the taco shop. I tried one of their steak tacos and they were alright. Awesome salsa bar, never had strawberry salsa nor sweet pecan. It's a little pricey but hey guess that's the gourmet part. Will definitely try more items on the menu. Staff was very nice. I wanted a strawberry lemonade and since they only had regular lemonade the guy made me some and honestly wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Ate there today after golf w/husband & his best friend, took some coaxing to get them into small place in not so best area ...but SUCCESS! Tacos were great, salsa bar & chips awesome, fun for all. Like posted elsewhere, SMALL noisy but worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I am obsessed with their salsa, yum! Also they have an awesome happy hour."}
{"text":"The bakery sells traditional Mexican pastries which are excellent. The baked goods in the window are self-serve, to be placed on a tray, while the ones on the counter are not. There are a few tables in the front; I didn't see the back area. They sell a variety of coffee and tea. I suggest the guava pastries and the concha. I'll return to try other sweets."}
{"text":"I wanted to be blown away by a gourmet taco shop, but sadly I live in Southern California, and when you live there being amazed by tacos take A LOT. I definitely recommend this place, but it doesn't have the WOW factor.

The Pros:
Awesome Salsa Bar - about a dozen delicious salsas. The regular Mexican salsa was flavorful and spicy. Some nice rare options too.
Service - Our server was very nice and attentive.
The Al Pastor - I tried the premium carne asada, fish taco, and al pastor. This is the only one I would go back for - great taste and tender pork.

The Cons:
Price - Like double the price of what I'm used to paying for any kind of taco.
Pepsi brand soda - Hells to the no!! and they didn't have Mexican coke either (they were apparently out).
Bleh on the fish taco - again, I am spoiled because I only eat fish tacos in Baja, but the batter was very soggy and bland.

Small place and tight parking but it wasn't crowded on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Had the gourmet tacos and a quesadillas, tgey were both delicious. Love the salsa bar, never had peanut or pecan salsa before but really enjoyed them. The house margarita was great. Only downside was we waited for our food a bit long cause we went during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday for lunch. Place was dead, only one other couple in the restaurant. Noticed speakers on the wall, but no music was playing. Not exactly a jovial atmosphere for a wonderful spring day in March. I ordered the Carne Asada and a Cochinita Pibil to be washed down with an Horchata. I then proceeded to the Salsa bar which appeared to have an outstanding selection and I immediately started filling cups with the many varietals eagerly anticipating being able to dress up my tacos. Chips were then brought out to snack on while I waited for my food. I can only describe these as cold, flavorless, and typical of most chain restaurant chips. Not a good sign. My Taco's arrived shortly thereafter. Unfortunately these too were nothing to write home about. The tortillas were cold and appeared store bought. The carne asada was overcooked and lacked any form of flavor. I attempted to spice things up by adding salsas, but these too were flavorless. Very little spice and hardly any seasoning. The cochinita pibil was enjoyable, as it was juicy and tasted like a quality cut of pork, but wrapped inside of a cold store bought tortilla the experience was muted. 

I highly doubt I will be returning to this restaurant, and I honestly question those that have written such outstanding reviews. My opinion, no taco shop should bill itself as \"Gourmet\" if it does not make its own tortillas, has bland salsas, and cannot make a juicy and flavorful carne asada."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of what's annoyingly referred to as \"Tex-Mex\" food, at all. It gives me the idea of pseudo-not-fast-food like Moe's, or lame cantinas, run by people whose ancestors probably couldn't pronounce \"cantina,\" that cater to the effete-minded \"Margaritaville\" crowd.

My wife, however, was attracted to the outside decor and lured in by the \"gourmet\" in the name.

Welp, folks, let me tell you: I'm really glad I went in this place. Their big advertisement is that they want to turn the tide of opinion on Mexican food/Tex Mex whatever from one of greasy, unhealthful junk to tasteful and thoughtfully-prepared fare- to the end of the latter, they did their due on me!

The woman and I had their take on quesadillas, which weren't the usual stupid flat flour tortilla cheese sandwiches with a pile o' salt and a not-pile of meat. In fact, these guys were made from homemade corn tortillas, deep fried (though not doused in grease) and filled well with your menu choice (In my case, al pastor; the wife got mahi-mahi). Folded over like a calzone and topped lightly with cojita sour cream, these guys are filled with flavor- flavor I've not experienced at any other Mexican joint in this city. The light crispiness of the tortilla really drives it home, and the quesadilla in all makes me think more of \"tamale grande\" than what you would classify as a quesadilla. (again, a boring flat cheese sandwich).

The price is kind of high; and while the portion is not *big* big as if you might get from a typical Mexican restaurant around here, let me tell you pals: It's well worth it.

Can't wait to try some new things here, sometime. In the meantime, go and try a quesadilla if you want to be flavor-blasted for the first time in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great tacos and especially salsas in a somewhat crowded small shop on 16th st. Maybe the best part of the experience is loading up on the salsas from the salsa bar and going to town on warm chips. (My favorite is the peanut salsa). 

They are also really are proud of the chocolate mole which is very unique and something I have not seen at other shops. They mole is great, very flavorful, but also very intense, so make sure you want a hardy meal before ordering a dish with it! Parking can be tight, especially if you come during the lunch hour as there are only a handful of spots outside the building."}
{"text":"I can't even.  This place is so good.  The salsas are unique and tasty so check out the salsa bar.  My husband ordered a cactus burrito- devoured it.  He's a vegetarian and had lots of good choices!

But the big wow for me was the corn quesadillas.  I know it sounds a little unassuming but order one.  Really.  I ordered the black mole chicken quesadilla and thought I was the luckiest girl in the world when it arrived.  My husband was seriously jealous-  so much so that he immediately got up and ordered the vegetarian quesadilla... Remember that he just inhaled a burrito....  his was just as incredible as mine.  

We're now trying to figure out how many more times we can get here before we fly out Sunday."}
{"text":"Molé.
That's all I have to say.

If you can eat anything containing the above listed ingredient at this restaurant, I highly recommend it. You will send your taste buds on a journey not unlike the opening credits of \"The Great Space Coaster\". Yes...I know...that dates me.

But seriously? This place is one of the best holes-in-the-wall in the downtown area. A wide array of menu items including burros, tacos, and house specialties will not disappoint. And then there's the salsa bar - which is regularly replenished - and is yours for the taking. No waiting around for someone to bring you more salsa. YOU are the salsa master. There are always at least 12-15 different and wonderful choices. 

Their berry and nut topped Horchata is a delightful surprise that easily shareable. Though I'd rather have one all to myself. 'Cause I'm a greedy bastard.

I've never seen anyone seated at the bar, but with it's rich woodwork and veritable smorgasbord of tequilas, I'm half tempted to walk one day in with a 10-gallon cowboy hat, chaps, and plop down to have a couple shots of reposed...while turning my head slowly to give various people in the tiny but functional dining room the ol' stink eye. It's the only way I'll ever feel tough.

So my verdict? Go here. And eat. You won't be sorry. Todo bien."}
{"text":"Strawberry salsa?? I've never heard of such a thing....but damn it's good! It's like chips and salsa...for desert! Fish tacos were on point, flavorful and plentiful. Topped it off with a premium margarita and I tell you what, that was the best meal I ever had! Now, for a place that has such good food, they got no where to sit. There is like 4 tables here and the bar, so try and go here during a not-so-popular time during the day to eat. Being able to sit back and enjoy all the food here is well worth it. The art on the walls are cool too."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Phoenix hands down. Incredible food, horchata is insane. Oh man, love this place."}
{"text":"If this is ur first time, order the La Santisima Specialty tacos with carne asada. You're welcome. That salsa bar though...."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos & Unbelievable salsa.  Chips were marginal and she apologized and agreed.   Atmosphere is quaint, art is fabulous.  Outstanding combination of flavors that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"The salsa bar is great. Try the strawberry salsa. Had the street tacos. Very tasty with the variety of salsas you can try with them."}
{"text":"First off, amazing salsa bar. Flavored I've never even seen and not sure if authentic, but great nontheless. If it weren't for Yelp, I know I would have never walked in. Wasn't necessary in a great location, but I'm so glad I went in regardless.

This place is pretty small but people popping in and out in a Saturday afternoon. Definitely a good sign but again I kinda want to keep it as my own secret place.

Got a their Cabo Shark taco and it was absolutely amazing. Also tried a bite from one of their shrimp tacos. Again amazing. Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"Solid offerings and an excellent salsa bar make this dive taco bar one of the places you must visit in Phoenix.  I haven't frequented other taco bars in the area so I can't comment on how it stacks up.  However, I think if you are charging higher prices for tacos they should include the rice and beans if you order two, or be packed to the brim with filling.  I must admit I was a bit jealous when my brother got his pibil taco, as this seemed to be one of the more filled-tacos on the menu.  The shark was outstanding and had great flavor.  Seating is at a premium so be careful with larger groups. You may just want to get them togo, sit on the curb outside and have yourself an authentic Mexican experience. I'll definitely visit again next time I'm in the area.  I could see myself pouring that Cilantro salsa on some fries to make for an excellent side dish."}
{"text":"Slow service. Waited 15 minutes without just a bowl of chips and no order taken. One server on a Sunday wasn't a good idea. Headed elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went again tonight with my sisters and we shared a few tacos... great service, the waitress was super friendly, and although she was the only one there was attentive.  We ordered a burro to go, and she packed it nicely with a bag of chips.  We finished out this meal with some flan, and having had what I thought was great flan in Mexico, I was pretty impressed!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! The food is amazing!!! The margaritas were very good as well.
Joel, our server, took great care of us!!!
Cool place to come to with family and friends."}
{"text":"$6.99 for 2 chicken mole tacos, rice, beans and chips and salsa?  Unreal.  I am a mole freak.  The first time I had mole it was hand made in a process that took 6-8 hours.  It spoiled me.  If mole is on a restaurant's menu I will try it and usually with disasterous results.  This is the first place in years and years....and years that has chicken mole that was as good as the homemade batch that spoiled me.  And for $6.99???  Jeeez.  I think I'm tearing up.  Also the horchada is ridiculous...Get it."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious.
Best salsa bar in town. The pecan salsa is my favorite. Mexicana and pico are second favorites.
Horchata is a must.
Beware the cheezieness of the quesos!"}
{"text":"I ordered a burrito and 2 tacos w/ rice/beans. I was charged $20.85 for what I thought was a rip off. Looking at the chicken it appears like it's been sitting at room temperature all day. It's black, dry and old looking. They must think people are stupid and won't know the difference. It's harsh to say, but I could not finish a meal I purchased due to disgust."}
{"text":"Stop!!!! And wait... forever.

Be prepared to have hunger pains for over an hour (at least) as you wait for your name to be called. Here's the kicker. The restaurant was full of empty frikin tables!!

I'm all in favor of waiting for a good meal...  but waiting endlessly to eat, while the restaraunt sits half empty is some sort of tortuous joke.

And they won't apologize for it, let alone have an explanation.

Go here to starve. Not to 'eat'.

I beg you. Don't go.

How's the food? I have no fu*!%ing idea! After waiting for over an hour, we left. To get good service, and good FOOD elsewhere.

Going here, after spending over $7 on an uber ride, is my first regret. Not getting a photo of the restaurant being empty, while there was a line of famished patrons waiting outside, is my second regret.

Could I have saved them??  No. Can I save you? Yes. It's my obligation.

Cheers, 
Dj"}
{"text":"This was such a great find! The tacos were amazing and the horchata was absolutely delicious (never have seen it made that way!). The rice and beans were flavorful without being overpowering considering all of the ingredients in the tacos. We went around 2-3 pm and we're immediately seated. You must try the entire salsa bar - they're all SO different. Plus, the first bowl of chips is on the House. The service was great too!"}
{"text":"Ya'll know I'm going to plant a solid 5 STARs for the gourmet-all-you-can-eat SALSAs in this wonderful establishment! 

Incredibly pleasing choices ranging from mild n' smokey to furious, flame-grilled. Warm chips are served and the menu is brimming with delectable, hot choices including burros, quesas, and super-tasty fillers. 

Firstly, the pecan-fruit filled horchata is like a cold, lingering dessert. And it's huge, perhaps +32ounces of deliciousness. Spoon, please!

The Mole Chicken burrito was on the *sweeter* side and although super complex and dark choco-infused, it called for 3xpinch more spice to counter the sucrose.

The beans and rice are fair to fairly good, but nothing special. I've had great refried beans in my life and La Santisima could improve on this. I'll admit. 

The melted queso dip pleased the eye but must be consumed ASAP, prior to cooling down. Order prior to entree.

The la House burro was very savory, filled with shredded, grilled chicken and finely chopped fixings.

Service was genuine and sweet. Hoping to have a party their soon! 

A clean, cozy, artful gourmet taco shop is what you can expect from La Santisima.  

Next visit:  margaritas and tacos ."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was a bit slow as far as drinks.  But the food came out quickly.  We will be back.  Limited parking, but no fault of the restaurant other than where it's at on 7th street.  At lunch on a Saturday there was plenty of side street parking.  Boyfriend loved the horchata, said it was the best he ever had."}
{"text":"The food is better than average but the salsa bar is really good."}
{"text":"I saw the good reviews on here and decided to try it today. I was not a fan of the food at all. I left hungry because I decided not to eat my street tacos, they were still bleeding from the meat. My 3 year old loved his quesadilla though. It can be that I'm use to more authentic mexican food. I would have rather stuck with my instinct and went to salsita or El Taquito. This food is for people who has never tasted good mexican food. I wouldn't recommend this place to a hungery latino. Also its not kid friendly. Very very small inside. Everyone that left didn't look happy for some reason."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious...  from the salsa bar to the quesa to the horchata to the street tacos...  I don't think you can go wrong."}
{"text":"Reasons why I love this place:
1. Horchata with all kinds of goodies inside, like pecans and cantaloups and strawberries, I mean these are \"real\" and not those freeze-dried stuff. My poblem with it is it only comes in one size--32 ounces, which is like two meals for me.

2. The salsa bar...never knew there could be so many kinds of salsa! That alone is an adventure in taste-testing. My personal fave is the jicama one, which really is more of a relish but who's checking. 

3. Chicken mole and pibil...they do it right. Their mole could be a bit spicier for my taste but that's what the salsas are there for. I had the chicken mole as a taco and the pibil as a burro (separate occasion, alright, don't think I'm a pig now).

It's a great date place, I think. It's small, it's quaint, in a good neighborhood, and the satffers are very friendy. 

I love this place so much that I didn't even care about the tiny creature scurrying across the floor near the front door. That's  not their fault though. That was just an unfortunate situation. Not a reflection of them.

So try it."}
{"text":"Tasty food, great horchata. But, the waitresses seemed stressed out. Nonetheless, I will be back. Really enjoyed the food. Great cheat meal."}
{"text":"It is all about the salsa bar.

I've eaten their tacos many times, both at the restaurant and to go.  Food is fresh and tastier than many of the other mexican eateries close by.  It isn't cheap by any means, but the salsa bar has so many choices (delicious each one) that more than makes up for the slightly higher cost.  And the choices don't just range from pico de gallo to hot to hotter.  Some are tart, some are creamy, some are smoky and hit the back of your throat, some are hot on the front end, etc.  Just go and taste it for yourself

Because I live close by, I prefer to take my tacos home because the space is very small and (because the food is so good) it can get quite cramped in no time.  (And when the unfortunate circumstance of someone bringing in a baby happens, there really isn't any way to pretend you aren't in hell no matter how much Yoda you think you can channel.)  But get there early and down a few of their happy hour margaritas you might not care about the space.  

If anyone knows of another place with a salsa bar even half as good as La Condesa's, please let me know."}
{"text":"For shame.   For shame.


Ok, this review is not to talk about the food at La Condesa .  I am a huge huge fan of the food and service, and everything else about this place except one thing.  While eating with a friend from Tucson, he recognized the art on the walls as being the art of famous San Francisco artist Sylvia Ji.   So we called the owner over to ask about the artist.  She told us all the art was by Mexican artists Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez.   These are obvious reproductions of a young artist who is currently very hot and exhibiting all over the world.   How has La Condesa gotten away from this for so long?      

The owners probably have no idea, but this is some shameful shit, and as great of a reproduction as it looks and makes the little restaurant feel,  Sylvia should be notified and should cease and desist on these \"artists\".      Google Sylvia Ji  and check the La Condesa website and compare the art, and you'll see what Im talking about.   One of the paintings in there is an EXACT replica of one of her paintings."}
{"text":"On the rare occasion when I write a review, it's either about service, food, or both. Having been a server for 3 years, I'm very understanding and knowledgeable about the difficulties and disasters that can occur while serving. My experience at La Santisima was severely impacted by the understaffing. There was one woman on the floor and one bartender. Their roles included greeting guests, seating guests, getting water/drinks, making drinks, running food, taking orders, bussing tables, resetting tables, taking to go orders, packing up to go orders, and checking people out. I came the day after Christmas at 2pm, and every seat out of the 40 seats available at this restaurant were occupied. Not only is this impossible for two people to manage this type of volume on their own, but guest service several suffers because of it. My sister and I opted to just order to go, rather than sitting and adding another table to their load. After we ordered, We were directed to the extensive salsa bar, which would have been awesome, if half the salsa containers weren't already empty. I mean who has time to restock the salsa bar with sooooooo many other tasks to do, but as a guest it's disappointing.

The food we got to go was great! Hopefully they can get some more staff to make the whole experience more enjoyable for the guest and less stressful for those currently employed."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in years...and I've had a lot.  Everything was excellent, including the free salsas.  In fact, the cilantro salsa was so good I'd drink it. The quesadilla was deep fried, which I wasn't expecting.  Had I known, I'd have gotten something else.  The fried breaking was a little overpowering.  But, everything else was memorable, and we're working out how to stop again on the way out of town."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I loved it! I love their shrimp tacos and they have a salsa bar with a variety to choose from. Their displayed art work is beautiful and compliments the type of food they serve really nicely."}
{"text":"Amazing. Really. We were driving back to LA and we're looking for a place to stop for a quick but yummy lunch.... Found this place on Yelp and I am so glad we stopped here. Best tacos I've ever had. Salsa bar is amazing. The waitress mixed up my order so I have no idea what I ate but it was phenominal. Seriously, you need to eat here."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were amazing but two waiters for a jam packed restaurant. No bueno. Horchata was as nasty as it the name sounds."}
{"text":"One of my \"go to\" places in downtown Phoenix.  Food is very good, salsa bar is excellent.  Very creative menu, so you aren't stuck with just a single filling choice in your tortilla.  House special is a fave.
Place is very small, which can be an energetic environment for a meal.  However, it can also be a bit of a pain when you want to go to the salsa bar at the same time as someone else."}
{"text":"so so so glad I can walk here. Excellent food, tiny place, great atmosphere.  Salsa bar is unparalleled"}
{"text":"The salsa bar was an instant hit amongst my family. The guacamole was creamy and spicy. The salsa Mexicana was our favorite. Food was wonderful and inexpensive. Service was fast considering how busy the restaurant was and there were only 2 waitresses. Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! The food is delicious!  I've tried several of their different gourmet tacos,  and they do not disappoint!! If you're looking for variety,  great prices,  and good food, don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome flavors. We went on a Saturday around 1:00pm and the place was empty but filled up soon afterward. Service was prompt . The menu was bigger than expected and sounded pretty authentic. They have a full bar which was a plus as I was in mood for some tequila. I had the smoked marlin tacos and slow cooked pork tacos..both were incredibly flavorful and excellent. Not the best I have ever eaten but darn close and I have had a lot of great tacos in my travels. The only disappointment was I was hoping to also get a chile reano, sadly they don't offer them. I'll go back for sure when I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First thing, the food is freaking good. I never thought refried beans could actually be delicious and the margaritas were super flavorful. We had 4 different tacos and all of them were outstanding. 

One giant negative.....the lighting. They have 4 light bulbs lighting the whole restaurant. They have this great salsa bar that is their calling card and you literally can not see what you are selecting. They also have a beautiful, ornate, hand carved bar that is completely dark. 

The service is outstanding and the clientele is a great mix, from hipster to subarban."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  We walked in to place a to-go order and were not even acknowledged.  Then we stood there for at least 5 minutes and waited. No menu to even look at so we asked someone if we could see a menu and the man rudely told us to give him a second.  Clearly they don't need our business, so we walked out and will be taking our business elsewhere.  Also, it's pretty disgusting how you can look straight into the bathroom and see the toilet from the bar and tables.  Gross."}
{"text":"The Nagado taco was dope. Different from anything I've ever had. It was a little loud but the salsa bar and the food made up for that"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Phoenix. Trust me, in from So Cal where you can get the best Mexican food in the country. This place is AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"I just bit into the mole street taco.  Delicious.  I've lived in Puebla, Mexico, the birthplace of mole and La Condesa's is the best mole negra I've had outside of Puela.  This little restaurant is a wonderful suprise in this otherwise unassuming part of 16th Street."}
{"text":"Me and my partner ate here last weekend for the first time. It was busy, the wait was 20 minutes but well worth it. The prices are reasonable and parking wasn't difficult to find. The food and atmosphere are perfect."}
{"text":"Definite five. We're visiting PHX and trying to make as many taco stops as we can. This was a total yelp find, and we ordered based on tips. 

The horchata was exceptional--light and fruity. The best horchata I've had. Five just for that. 

Five for all three tacos we tried: Oaxacan Black Mole, Santa Condesa Mahi Mahi, and Mayan Cochinita Pibil. So good. 

And five for a varied and delicious salsa bar, great neighborhood feel, and helpful waitstaff. 

If I lived closer if be a regular!"}
{"text":"Great place!
Reasonable price with delicious food and friendly service.
The cafe were cute and sweet, and the shop inside was beautiful and interesting."}
{"text":"I had AL pastor.  The meat was really well seasoned.  Great service with a friendly staff.  The salsa bar is amazing.  Plenty of options I loved the guacamole!  I would definitely come back.  They do have limited seating but the food was so good if there is a lengthy wait I'd order take out."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The menu offers many more interesting choices than I am used to from the other local Mexican restaurants, and they're absolutely delicious 

The service was solid.

The extensive salsa bar is worth the trip alone.

They have Anchor Steam Beer for $3.00 during happy hour (Try it, you'll like it)

Beautiful artwork on the walls, and a very laid back, non pretentious, but still classy, environment."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos. Salsa bar is super fresh and offers many unique combos. My favorite was the spicy peanutty salsa. Soooo good. The place looks a little dicey from the outside but the food is top notch and service is outstanding."}
{"text":"I am from California so used to amazing Mexican food. But this place may be my favorite yet!  I had the beef quesadilla which was prepared differently than I've ever seen.  Fried large corn tortillas with yummy tender steak and cheese inside.  Wish I had room to eat the whole huge thing!  Also sangria was a work of art.  And totally reasonably priced.  Plus really nice people. So happy I followed yelp to this wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Fred M. pretty much said what I would say, so I won't beat a dead horse.  I'll add, though, that they offer a wide variety of deep-fried quesadillas.  

Did you catch that?

DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS!"}
{"text":"Our friends recommended the 16th St location a month or two ago and it was so simple yet awesome.  The salsa bar is fun and so many tasty varieties to try.  I really like the jicama, cilantro, peanut and of course traditional ones.  The menu is a little confusing but once you kind of figure it out, you're good.  I was suggested to try the grapefruit margarita by my friend and it as so refreshing.  Usually most places margarita's are loaded with that awful sour mix but this did not give me any weird after taste or belly aches :)  So of course had to get it again at this location and just the same, good!  Then last time I had tried two different tacos.  One was pork the other beef and the beef was incredible.  I then tried the beef yesterday in their quesa version and oh my.  Such a neat presentation and so good.  Loved the fresh sliced avocado on the top.  Even took half home for leftovers.  Can't wait to go back and try other items too.  I have heard about the horchata's but have not had enough room at the end of my meal to try them but maybe next time."}
{"text":"Been here a hand full of times and LOVE it every time I go. Their quesadillas are not like any quesadilla I've ever had; all of their tacos are delicious, they have a huge salsa bar, and the best horchata I've ever had. I'll def keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, me and my boyfriend eat here quite a few times.  Tacos are like street tacos, defiantly worth the drive."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great ambiance and busy. We've had to wait for a table on occasion but get there in-between times and you'll sit right away.  Cochinita pibil is the first taco we pick and then whatever else strikes the mood, you can't go wrong with the tacos. Go straight to the salsa station and try a variety of flavors, you'll be back for more! Margaritas are big and Micheladas are bigger. The walls have great art too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing; really everything on the menu is good. My favorites are the Cabo shrimp Tacos ( peanut salsa is a must for these) and the Chilaquiles (breakfast).  The quesadillas are also out of this world. The only downside is the dining room is very small and it tends to get busy."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the salsa had a lot of verity. They have a peanut salsa that had a lot of spice and a great after taste that I highly recommend. The only problem was I had to wait 40 mins for my food but the salsa filled my time waiting."}
{"text":"Fellow Yelpian reviews finally got me to visit this place to try it out. I am going to keep this short and to the point.... the food was yummie.... the salsa choices were very good and I now love the strawberry salsa..... the price was fair.... the service was ok!!...  The only thing I did not like was the portions were a bit on the small side.... the pulled pork is yummie/messy.... the dogfish shark tacos were yummie.... the art was interesting... the place was clean....

Summary... I will visit it again but I did not think it was out of this world great..... but over-all a good exp...."}
{"text":"Everything is so good. I love the salsa bar and their unique take on Mexican cuisine. Get a horchata, you won't regret it. The alcohol can be a bit pricey if you're not getting happy hour, but worth it. The margaritas are so fresh and I really love how they add a teensy bit of grapefruit."}
{"text":"I have tried to eat here so many times and the wait is always RIDICULOUS! There's always empty tables and the line waiting is longer than people are seating eating. It's at least a 30 min wait even though more than half the restaurant is empty.  I have come on both weekday and weekend and early around 5-6 pm.  Being a pregnant mother of a toddler waiting is just not an option. Seems like a bad business model. Go to Taco Sahuahro instead excellent cheap street tacos."}
{"text":"Met up a few friend here for brunch, this place in chill, nice and up beat. Art work inside of ten restaurant and on the walls outside were great."}
{"text":"What a awful night! I am not only ending up with a stomachache and going to the bathroom every 2h! I can't see even a picture of those plates because will make me sick again. We ask for burritos and the meat inside looks like a canning meat, the taste wasn't impressive. We asked for not spicy soup and they brought it spicy! Poor plate presentation! Although the services was good! I highly recommend not to go there!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food in Phoenix. This is a must try. The salsas for the chips are outstanding also the burritos. I always get the gaucho, is to die for. Great job, thank you."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out but after the bad customer service I walked out after 15 minutes of waiting there. I went with my husband and 6 year old son and as we walked in we saw it was busy. I didn't mind it being busy or waiting but after 5 minutes of waiting and none of the waiters greeting us and just passing by over and over again I started to get annoyed. So we stood there another 5 minutes as another group of people came in.  A couple minutes later the waiter went to them and sat them in an empty table he had just cleaned off. I was in disbelief and told my husband that it was time to leave. It was a waste of 15 minutes just standing there. I have never written a bad review before but how we were treated was awful and I hope they see this review."}
{"text":"We finally had an opportunity to check out La Condesa and it lived up to all the great reviews we had read.  We overordered as we wanted to try several things.

The salsa bar was fun.  It was nice to try a few different flavors.  My daughter who doesn't like spice really enjoyed the peanut salsa.  The tomatillo was exceptional as well.  

I did not think the guacamole was well executed.   There were onions, tomatos, pineapple and cilantro but it was more pico-ish than guacamole-like.  And where was the avocado?  For $3.95 the portion was relatively small.  I would definitely pass on this in the future.    

For main courses, we had the mole chicken quesa and an assortment of tacos.  

The mole was exceptional and wasn't at all bitter.  The quesa itself was flaky, crisp and delicious.   If you are a mole fan, this is a must try.

For tacos, we had the baja shrimp, slow cooked pork and carne asada.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the breading light and didn't overwhelm the flavors.  I loved the pork which was moist, flavorful and satisfying.  The carne asada was very good though pretty typical street taco fare.   

I will definitely dine here again.   The setting matched the food... casual, comfortable but not your typical mexican fare.  It's definitely a step above."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. There is a good selection of coffee and pastries. The drinks are made pretty fast, even when it is crowded. There is plenty of space to sit and enjoy your beverage. Many people go to work on their computers or study. It is a fairly loud environment, so if you're looking for a quiet library setting you won't find that here."}
{"text":"I've been all over the web to find out how much you charge for your fancy tacos. Can't find your prices..code for toooo high for me. Sorry."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had during my week in Phoenix, with a literal buffet of well-made salsas to match. 

Busy and a little disorganized at lunch (they needed one more person to help handle the crowd), it's worth seeking out.

Get the horchata with fruits and pecans, too - it's great."}
{"text":"I love this place. Very welcoming staff and authentic food. Every time friends visit from out of state, this is always a dinner spot request. The name change has in no way changed the flavor. Thanks."}
{"text":"The food is simply AMAZING. Some of the best pastor and chicken mole I've tasted. The margaritas as so good that its all I've ever had to drink there lol. I've heard the horchata is good. The place is small and the place is super small but that still won't stop me from going. I wish the staff members were more friendly or even attempted to greet you. When they see you they kind of look away and its awkward. The service is not fast at all, and you will be lucky if you get a full sentence out of the waiters, especially the lady. They are lucky the food is literally AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Yes!! Go here! Order anything and it will be delicious. Guacamole and horchata are highlights!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of favorite restaurants ever. Everything from their margaritas to their burritos to their salsa is so awesome. Their speciality burrito is my favorite."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food made with quality ingredients in a comfortable setting. Salsa bar has great variety from the usual to ones with strawberry. Munch on salsa and chips while they make your food which does take a little time as it's cooked to order. I like my food spicy but like to counter it with their horchata which is chock full of fruit and pecans. My favorites are the chicken mole and grilled veggie tacos."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE taco shop! Every salsa is unique and delicious. Margaritas are some of the best I've ever had out - not too sweet, yummy citrus pulp for flavor. Amazing horchata. Beautiful artwork. Kind of small inside so you may have to come at a slightly odd hour to be sure you get a seat. Oh! I almost forgot about the guacamole! Very fresh and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Had the Mole and it was great!!!!!  I had the horchata it had great flavor but I wasn't a fan of the extra noise on top of it, next time I will hold on the extras and just ask for the drink. My wife had the fish tacos and LOVED them."}
{"text":"I'm in town from a place where we don't have Mexican food (how could I live in such a place?). We went to three taco shops in three days. This was the best - rich flavors and tortillas which held up to salsa!! My friend had a Norteno green chile burro - she couldn't stop talking about it, either. I can't wait to go back on my next visit to AZ!"}
{"text":"La Condesa is amazing.  I'll keep this review short and sweet...

Short wait is well worth it. 
Horchata is amazing
The Mahi Mahi Burro might change your life... if i wasnt already in a relationship with the Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus from Pita Jungle, i might actually try to make love with this burrito.  

Everything about this place is great.  Eat here... if you don't, you are probably crazy... maybe you are the dude at Circle K that is always talking to himself by the dumpster...  That dude creeps me out a little bit.    So, i guess the moral here is:  Eat at La Condessa, so you don't end up talking to a dumpster.  That is all."}
{"text":"First time visit, late Saturday night. Food was good, though presentation wasn't too pretty. Ordered a burrito and when served, that's all that was on my plate. A little sauce and maybe a sprinkle of cheese with some garnish would have painted a prettier picture, but it nevertheless tasted very good. We shall return."}
{"text":"My advice would be to try and go at a time other than customary meal times, so you can find a table."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. All of the ingredients are really fresh and delicious. The unique salsa bar is a nice touch as well."}
{"text":"Oh my the namesake taco was fantastic!   Salsa bar was good but the tacos and the burro's are no joke either!  Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best mexican restaurant that I know of. I was visiting Phoenix for a week. I had bookmarked this place because lots of \"vegetarians go nuts for it\".

On the first night in Phoenix, my friend and I drove here for dinner at 8 PM. Neighbourhood is very quite/rundown/sketchy. However, the restaurant was fully packed. Just when we entered through the door, everyone looked at us. May be this is what people in Phoenix do. It felt a little weird as if we were crashing someone's party. We were seated at a table just emptied by someone else. That table was not very clean.

We got a basket of chips and started getting salsas. I was in salsa heaven. I like spicy food. This place serves it very well. We ended up ordering their La Santisima burritos and quesos. Another order of chips. Decided to come back again before we go back from Phoenix. I liked the burrito better than the queso.

I don't want to spend more time in Phoenix. However, this will be go to spot for one meal when I am there. Definitely worth the wait and experience. Price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"So bummed. We have been going to this place for years which is why I gave it 2 stars over 1. In the food biz service is everything and this place has broken my heart. We brought a friend here from NY ranting and raving about the food the whole way. When we arrived we were quickly embarrassed as the entire staff treated us as if we were invisible. We stood by the \"please wait to be seated\" sign for almost 10 min. as the staff worked hard to not make eye contact with us. We ultimately had to ask the busser if there was a host. Half the restaurant was empty. They easily could have acknowledged us, sat us, offered chips and told us the kitchen was behind. Instead they chose to completely ignore us making us feel as if they wanted us to just turn around and walk out. We took the hint and went to Pepe's Taco Villa where they made us feel at home."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. What a totally different experience from my last visit.  I will come back during the week to eat, but the staff on the weekend was horrible.  I sent my food back twice and it still came back to me wrong.  The waitress didn't speak a word of English and could not understand at all what I wanted. I ordered the exact same entrée I had the last time I was here but it was a totally different meal that was delivered to me. I even showed them the picture I posted in Yelp as to what my food should look like. They tried to match the picture, but they had no clue. So disappointed! I could go on and on, but I won't. Again I don't recommend going on the weekend.  The thing that shocked me the most was even after the horrible experience with the food being sent back, I had to pay the full check. If a customer sends something back twice and it still comes back wrong, they should not be charged.  The food should be the same no matter when it is ordered."}
{"text":"I've been to La Condesa three times this week for the mole chicken tacos. I think about them all the time. This place is cozy inside with a big salsa bar which I'm working my way through.  Be sure to try the cilantro cream! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because service can be a bit slow, even when there are only two tables of people. And also, I nearly lock myself in the bathroom every time because that darn latch is so hard to open."}
{"text":"Tiny, tiny place with food to die for!  The burritos are outta this world.  Lots of salsa to choose from with tasty chips.  Everything we've had has been delicious. I usually get the al pastor burrito and finish it later at home."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS TACOS! I loved this restaurant. The margaritas were BEUNO!!! I would definitely suggest visiting here if you are coming from out of town. It is a great hole in the wall. Be patient, just be patient and enjoy the experience here. They do a great job managing the wait and the food hardly took long for how busy they were."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow wow wow
Best Mexican around. Only reason I tried this place was because of all the reviews. Doesn't look like much from the outside but it was amazing. Awesome salsa bar! The guacamole is different but awesome! The street tacos with great too. I'll be coming back to try more stuff!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!!  Arizona already has the best Mexican food around, but this place is truly a gem.  All the sauces are homemade and present a wide spectrum of flavors.  My favorite unique items from the salsa bar were the peanut salsa (spicy, most likely has habaneros in it), pecan salsa (similar but very mild with interesting flavor), strawberry salsa, and jicama salsa.  Everything was incredibly fresh.  After sampling everything from our group, I would recommend getting one of their mole dishes (the mole is stellar) or the mahi mahi fish tacos.  Also, their house made guacamole was amazing; very unique and chunky with lots of different veggies in it.  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Three visits before the last I would have reviewed much higher.  

As a self proclaimed salsa snob, I like that I can try such a variety and found several that were spot on.  From Hot! to exotic.  I could just go in for chips and salsa bar and savor one of the jalapeno, cilantro margaritas! Caution, they use fresh jalapenos so sometimes they are much spicier than others.  My friend loved the tamarind margarita. 

Prices look high but you get a lot for the money.  Their burritos are HUGE and most of the tacos are made with full size double corn tortillas. There are many choices to fit all tastes.  However, I would not recommend the fish tacos.  I ordered the baja style and could not eat it.  It tasted as if it had been frozen for a long long time.  The other tacos tried were very good. 

Our last trip in, there were 4 of us, no problem getting a table on Friday at 4pm but the service was terrible..  Not sure if they were breaking in new staff or what.  In three visits, I knew their menu better than the waiter did and he had no knowledge of their \"special house margaritas\".  Service as really slow and they kept making mistakes on the drink orders.  

I will give them another try."}
{"text":"A great taco spot can be judged by the salsa. I pony up to the La Condesa salsa bar and prepare to judge. Today's salsa varieties included strawberry, cilantro, guac, and my fav a spicy salsa with tamatillios. Spicy, complex, AUTHENTIC, developed flavors exploded in my mouth as I sampled a rainbow of salsa with the chips that arrive before my tacos. Instantly, I could tell,  La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop knows what they're doing in the kitchen, they care about quality, and are super fresh.  

If Mexican food can be judged by salsa, a good Mexican restaurant can also be judged by the frijoles. These beans did not disappoint. Great flavor, perfect consistency, delicious salty cheese on top. MMMMM! 

The Main Event: Tacos. Yay! Roasted Veggies: Awesome! Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco: WOAH! My lunch buddy declared: \"This is as good as my favorite taco stand in Mexico!\" (She lived there for 6 years!) How's that for authentic?! The Horchata may be the best in town. Definitely homemade, with strawberries, mmmmm. Not too sweet or watery. I can not wait to try the fried quesidillias.  

With food this delicious, decor may not matter, however the inside is cozy & clean with heavy wooden tables and contemporary chicano art. I especially love the doors to the banos. 

Prices are completely fair, cheaper than a combo at a chain restaurant. Meal for two with drinks was $20.

Taco Row is one reason i struggle with the thought of leaving the southwest. Salsa and tacos this phenomenal are difficult to recreate too far from the border. La Condesa, the new kid on the block, is worthy of praise & adoration.  i look forward to a long, delicious affair."}
{"text":"I enjoy both authentic Mexican tacos and excellent variations of the originals. The restaurant offers both. The simple and delicious street style tacos are as good as the ones cooked on the carts on the side of the streets in Mexico. The shrimp taco was also divine. The salsa bar was a treat. The chips were just ok."}
{"text":"Spicy and amazing food! Kinda want to keep this one secret, yes it a place you def don't want to turn into a tourist joint. Also the name has changed on the exterior signs."}
{"text":"Aztec Tinga Tacos were amazing, service was acceptable. The salsa bar is great too. I did't try any cocktails but the food was amazing I will be back."}
{"text":"You'll want to legalize immigration, for sure, once you try this food and salsas. The salsa bar brings strawberry, pecan, cilantro and other 8 or so collection of salsas to be savored with your basket of chips.  An array of hotness, so sweet, yes!  This food will make you question what the heck was that other Mexican food you once thought to be delicious.  This is true Mexico City cuisine. 

I've been to Mexico City and have tasted el sabor verdadero, now here in Phoenix, is a family owned restaurant that brings this authentic Mexican flavor to you and yours and you will say thank you its here.  Provecho!

Keep up the good work to be great Condesa!  Gracias."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from San Diego where we have the best Mexican food . The menu , I didn't really get so I ordered the soup which was great ! A little bit of direction on where to order would be good . The line was long the people in front of me didn't know where to order, they just passed me a menu . I stood in line hoping that that was what I was supposed to be doing . My star rating is for the salsa bar , I'm very impressed. It's hard to find places that offer a hot salsa"}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!
The place is small and if you have to wait, don't worry it is worth your time."}
{"text":"Great tacos, delicious micheladas! Great selection of sauces, love the decor. Service was friendly and prices are good."}
{"text":"This place is Tha sh*t!! Im glad I stopped by great food amazing flavor ! The chicken specialty tacos best tacos I've ever had in my whole entire life no joke!"}
{"text":"Holy. Cow. This place is the real deal. From their salsa to their margaritas- i can not get enough of this place! The portions are great and the food is spectacular melt in your mouth Mexican. It's a tiny place with great service. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I'm not one to review very often, but this place is hands down my favorite restaurant I've ever been to in my life. I'm an arizona native and like to think I know a thing or two about Mexican food and this place has perfected it.

Must try: cochinita pibil taco 


Their whole menu is great but that taco alone I could eat every day of the week. 

Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"I was nervous about the location (not the safest looking part of town) but was quickly and pleasantly surprised to find we made the right choice. This restaurant is tiny (maybe 10 tables), so the one waitress would seem like enough, but with the popularity of this place she could have used more help. I orders the vegan burrito and was so happy. Wrapped in a freshly made tortilla, veggies delight with all the right spice."}
{"text":"Like everyone else said, the atmosphere and artwork are what really make the place! We ate around 7pm and luckily we only had a 5 minute wait but I could see there being a long wait during the dinner rush since there's limited seating. I highly recommend the guacamole dip, I have no idea what's in it but it's so unique and delicious (I think it has mangoes and cranberries?). I also had the shark tacos which were good!"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite taco shops ever! The restaurant itself is pretty small inside, but it is always packed because it is a local favorite. There is a salsa bar with around 15 different types that you can sample for your chips and dinners. Every time I go I get two fish tacos, and they always hit the spot. The different alcoholic drinks look amazing, and I will have to try one of those the next time I come! I have tried taking every person I love here just to share this favorite of mine with them!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go, I am reminded just how good the food is. Not to mention the quality is fantastic. If you haven't been, you are missing out."}
{"text":"OMG this place is simply amazing. Delicious gourmet shrimp & fish tacos and the best salsa bar in town. I've been here a dozen times and I've yet to sample all of them (mostly because the \"salsa cilantro\" is ridiculous). It gets a little crazy during lunch time. The only knock on this place is the side of rice amount (the amount of beans is good - not fan of beans though) you get when you spend the extra $1 and get the taco \"plate.\" But you can always get a street taco for $1.25 MORE you would spend other wise on the \"plate\"... If you're not a fan of beans."}
{"text":"My parents came into town last month, and they always want me to take them out to eat.  I, however, don't go out to eat, so it makes it really hard.  La Condesa isn't far from our house, and I've been wanting to try it, so we went there.  The food was amazing!  Even my mom - who is the pickiest eater I know - liked it!  The different salsas at the bar are great, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"The fresh salsa bar is the featured attraction.  20 - 30 types daily with differences nearly every day.  The food is great-to-fantastic.  Decor is nice and the space is small and tight.  Don't expect table service - go to the counter, order and pay.  They will bring you your food.  If you are looking for white linen napkin experience, go to The Barrio.  If you want some of the best salsa and tacos in town - come here."}
{"text":"The food is some of the best Mexican food in Arizona.  The service is terrible though.  They have recently expanded their seating, which is great, but it doesn't seem that they have expanded their Kitchen capacity.  The wait staff is not very friendly.  Not unfriendly, but they don't add anything to the dining experience.  Food takes a long time, usually 30+ minutes to get your food.  This makes it hard to take our kids here, as they find it hard to wait for their food that long.  We go here a lot, because the food is amazing, but that is the only reason.  If they had the service aspect of dining, it would be one of the best restaurants in the state."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan tacos. Lots of vegan/vegetarian options. The salsa bar has lots of variety. The staff are friendly and the place looks really cool. The plates are earthenware and look cool too"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  From their website: 

Our aim is to deliver everything that is exciting and fresh about Mexican cuisine to the people of Arizona, banishing old perceptions of heavy, greasy, taste bud-searing, so-called \"Tex-Mex.\"

And they nailed it.  There were 13 different salsas when we went, and all differing with heat and ingredients.  Not a traditional place.

Be aware: there's not too many tables, and waiting seems to be expected by patrons."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while and finally did. Had the carne asada street taco plate with jamacia. It was delish -- took me back to Rocky Pointe vacations. The beans are authentic and the rice is white Salvadorian style. Great art work and service. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are by far one of the best I've had. But if you are a patient then this location might not be for you. Although the food and drinks are very good, the service was not so good. We waited about 30min for our drinks...2 micheladas, a sprite and a horchata. Another 45 min after for our food. I probably won't come back to this location, but definitely to the phx one."}
{"text":"Their quesas are the bomb.com!  They're very big, so you can totally split one with a friend.  The salsa bar was great and had different varieties of salsas and guacamole.  We went there around 11:30 and it was pretty busy, but that's not surprising for a place that has really good food eh?  I'll definitely be back to try more! :)"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place bases on the reviews.  I am giving this 4 stars because it was kind of a long wait (35 minutes) and there aren't a lot of benches outside to sit, (also it was hard to get water refills during our dinner.) But once inside, it is totally worth it!  The salsa bar is very unique and I liked how I could sample so many different kinds.  I got the mole tacos and would recommend trying one and maybe a different kind."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, had the Marlin Kay-so-dillas. Horchata was off the chain! going to be going back soon. Our server was great and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing food! You must try the horchata and the mole tacos! I could eat here twice a week."}
{"text":"Probably the best tacos in town. Please don't move!!! Also, being Hispanic I've had my fair share of Horchata's in my life...this one tops them all, it's more like an Horchata Salad, just brilliant!"}
{"text":"Amazing salsa bar! There wasn't one that I disliked, although there was a chipotle one that I loved the most. The pastor tacos were the best of the street tacos we tried. Amazing flavor! The carne asada was okay; not great. Would go back for the salsa, pastor, and to try other things."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I haven't had quality Mexican food since moving out if So. Cal, but La Santisima is delicious! A plain chicken burrito is a bit pricey but anything unusual (shark or smoked marlin) is the same price."}
{"text":"Just left this \"Kitchen Nightmare\" on Cinco De Mayo. The moment we walked in we could tell the food would be good. Unfortunately, the vegetarian Quesa was basically a pocket of air and tasted like it was fried in something that fries fish.The place is being run without strategy or organization; staff wanders around aimlessly without purpose, empty tables everywhere, bussed and not, and the bar was full of dirty dishes so no where to sit on CINCO DE MAYO on a Friday night. Meanwhile, patrons were left to wait for up to 45 minutes while the incompetence continued. The manager (ponytail) has no clue what he's doing, seemed to make his staff uncomfortable, and makes customers uncomfortable. The guy is really unprofessional and we couldn't wait to leave.  Not going to return here until changes are made. Also to the manager: stop touching the arm of your waitresses, it's creepy. -Former waitress of 4 years."}
{"text":"I saw 450 plus reviews and almost 5 star rating. Well here is another 5 star. The menu is a little overwhelming at first. So I tried the Cabo Shrimp taco. Amazing. Then the smoked marlin taco. More amazing. Then the tinc a chicken taco. OMG. The salsa bar is extensive all made from scratch. I tried six of them and they were all terrific.  The salsa peanut and salsa strawberry really stood out."}
{"text":"Okay.... Where was the strawberry salsa? The Guacamole was gone too.  I went here with my sister and was so confused with the menu. It was posted on the wall and it was so hard to read. Why was it posted on the side and not in the front? The place was okay. I ordered the the shrimp tacos and got fish. They messed up my order, but they were busy...oh well. The fish was good though, so I didn't complain. I'll try it again and give it another chance."}
{"text":"Amazing house recipe horchata.
Salsa bar to die for. 
Street tacos: the BEST. 
Will go back as often as we can. 
Tamarindo Margarita AMAZING!"}
{"text":"The service was a little bit slow but worth the wait after visiting here from the East Coast it was great to get some real authentic Mexican food I had the shark tacos & recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Steak tacos are awesome. ..so is salsa bar! Make sure you come by early, for no wait."}
{"text":"Wow! We pulled up to this place with some skepticism, but after entering we  immediately knew we were in for a great lunch. With a salsa bar in the corner, we were given chips and first tried 3 different salsas. We ordered two types of tacos and a chicken mole quesadilla to share. The tacos were good, and the quesadilla was like a fluffy fried calzone. Absolutely delicious! The only bump was the fact I ordered my taco with no mushrooms and it came with them, but I didn't mind that much. 

My husband had a hornitos margarita which was good as well. Next time we're in Phoenix we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This was a great find! We enjoyed the homemade horchata which was bursting with flavors like cinnamon, nutmeg, fruit and nuts.  Equally as delish was the guacamole. This is not your typical guacamole. It was more chopped than mashed and had dried cranberries in it. Very tasty. I had the cabo tacos and the beer batter was too thick for my liking, but my fiancé ordered a chicken taco and it was much better. When I come back again, I will try non-beer battered tacos!"}
{"text":"As much as I love their veggie quesa and amazing salsa bar, I am taking them down a star because I found out they use lard in their rice and beans.  As a vegetarian, this really limits the menu items I can eat.  

Veggie quesa is pretty much the only thing I can get.  It is fantastic so it is worth going just for that.  Actually, I'd probably even go just for the salsa bar.  But I wish I could explore other options too."}
{"text":"Hole in way gem,not to be missed. Great tacos ..good serving size..salsa bar is great..margaritas with real alcohol. Super value for money"}
{"text":"I really want to give them five stars. I love: the art, the atmosphere, the super friendly servers. 

I think I would have loved many of the salsas, but they ran out of cups & had small plates to put the salsas on instead. Dude, it's really hard to dunk a tortilla chip into a plate of salsa. I tried the cilantro & the tomatillo & both were great, but couldn't muster the effort trying to scrape another flavor off the bottom of a plate.

The Mayan pork taco was damn near perfect, but I thought the chicken mole was a little too much on the sweet side."}
{"text":"QUE BUENO!!!  Been to this one and the one in Flag and both have been INCREDIBLE!  The food is beyond fantastico!  The tacos, the burritos, and the salsa bar are just awesome!  The salsa bar alone is pretty amazing, with all the different types.  The drinks are great, too and not at all stingy on the pour.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best experiences in the city! They opened up years ago under a different name without a liquor license but with the same sexy, sexy salsa bar. They got awards a few years in a row from The New Times seven or eight years ago when they were new. (That's actually how my college friends and I found about about them in the first place.) I think they've had to go through some phases with the salsa bar-everyone used to come in and just take twenty salsas home, so they went from limiting how many salsa containers you could get to how many lids you could get to at least limit take-home, and recently i've seen them just allow you to grab as much as you want again because no one has the time anymore to take ten-there are too many people crowded around you! If there's one thing that's constantly changed over the years I've been going here, it's that every year that goes by this place gets more crowded. One day, they'll need a bigger restaurant. Until then, I'm sure they'll continue to add gorgeous decorations like the fly paintings and the beautiful bar. OK: on to the food!

I've noticed a few expansions in the menu in recent years, but I'm going to stick to describing the basics here because they're what make this place so good. (Well... basic foods done impressively well, and intriguingly not-basic salsas.) The menu is great here because they have regionally themed dishes for various mexican states-not all 31, just a handful, but each one is starkly different, comes with different toppings and it's possible to have each meat various ways. basically you can get your meats as tacos, burros or as a quesadilla. You're going to have to just think about it before ordering-they'll make you whatever you want, but some combinations are better than others. For instance, a Mole burrito is baller, having Cochinita Pibil is just brain-melting in a quesadilla, and I could eat their fried shark tacos any day of the week. (The steak is good every way.) Don't blame the restaurant if your Mole quesadilla doesn't make a lot of sense, haha-they'll give it to you the way you ask for it. Just pay attention to the toppings when you're picking your mode of dinner. You won't regret it. I seem to have mentioned the best things in my personal opinion already... the cochinita pibil is perfect and I only know one other restaurant in AZ that makes it right, and it's much more of a fine dining place than la santisima here, so I give them a lot of points for correctly marinating the queen's dish, one of the best meats I've ever had. It's easy to describe the meats: perfect. Time to move on to the salsa.

The award winning salsa bar is second to nothing in the city. If you don't try the peanut salsa, you're missing out. Even though it's changed over the years from a spicy cream salsa to a spicy salsa and back to a spicy cream salsa, it's always been phenomenal. The pecan is more of a cream since it's not spiced like the peanut. The \"red pepper\" isn't exactly salsa-it's red pepper oil, and if you have a leftover side of it, fry pork chops in it... you'll be all set to go back to santisima the next day to start it all again! There's everything from pico to several types of vegetable salsas, and the cilantro cream is good at cutting the heat you've added to any dish. 

If you want to taste some of the food people leave Arizona talking about, look no further than this fun little hole in the wall. One of the plus sides is probably going to be that you could come back to this place on every visit, and bring your kids and grandkids here someday: hopefully this gem never leaves the streets of our spicy valley!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town. It's a very small restaurant so you might have to wait but it's well worth it. The food is fresh and reasonably priced. The salsa bar alone makes it worth the trip. The Margaritas are also very good if a little pricy."}
{"text":"I was brought here for lunch by a co-worker, and it's now my go-to dinner on the way out to Coyotes games.

The tacos are out of this world, but even better is the salsa bar.  Peanut salsa? Cilantro salsa? Pico? Yes, and more; over 10 salsas made fresh daily on site. The place is small and decorated brilliantly in a Dia de Los Muertes theme year-round. 

Sometimes the waitstaff can seem a little disinterested, but during lunch you order from the bar and sit down whenever something frees up. 

Don't go here for the service, go here for the amazing food and enjoy a little taste of Mexico in Phoenix."}
{"text":"La Condesa was the final push to convince me to sign up for Yelp.  I've been using Yelp for years to find everything from local cuisine to family doctors but now it's time to share.  So here goes...

La Condesa was excellent.  From the moment we entered through the heavy spanish doorway, to the smart and humble decor - we knew we had found something unique.  

Our server was polite, engaging, and insightful.  We've been searching for the ultimate Baja-style Fish Taco so we chose a-la-carte tacos this time and will return later for the full meal.  What we did experience this time was a dream come true in the land-locked state of Arizona.  The two pieces of fish in each taco were huge, hot, and crispy, wrapped in a light corn tortilla with a liberal covering of cabbage and white sauce.  With the first bite I was instantly taken back to memories of lounging beach-side in Mexico, or more recently the taco shops of Southern California.  My second and continued bites were adjusted to new heights of flavor with the plethora of home-made salsas available.

I can't wait to return and plan to bring friends!

Troy."}
{"text":"went to the one on 16th st...food was great but place too small."}
{"text":"Food let's just say it was  OK ........had better but the waiting time worst I've had in years we waited 45 to 1hr  just for our food 

I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE unless your willing to wait.

I wish they had better service they have a lot of staff but only one server for all tables"}
{"text":"My family's first time here. We heard great things so we HAD to come. We had a 20 min wait unless we wanted to sit at a dark (no light)table. We didn't want to wait so we accepted. It was darker than I had expected. The table wasn't cleaned so we grabbed napkins to clean it and the hostess finally comes and cleans it for us. We got our chips and was told the salsa bar was behind us. There was no salsa at the bar. We asked for the salsas to be refilled 4 times.  Our food came out at separate times. We had no silverware. I asked for flour tortillas for my soup and didn't get them. It wasn't a great experience. I'm not sure we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Truly delicious gourmet mexican food.  Don't miss the house guacamole with mangos and raisins and the burrito El pastor."}
{"text":"Is there a secret door I don't know about? My expectations were way to high I guess. Definitely won't make a special trip back over and probably wouldn't stop back by even if I was hungry and close. Pickled red onions in a burrito doesn't constitute next level Mexican cuisine. I think the high rating is for environmental authenticity."}
{"text":"Is this real? Are they serious with this? The ambiance was small, cozy, and art was hung on the wall that was really very good. Unbelievable service and food. All the salsas at the bar were stellar and my shark tacos were dynamite. I'm kind of a sucker for rice and beans and I think it's hard to mess up but I've still had some awful rice and beans at some other spots. Luckily, this place had some of the best I've had in a while. The prices were great, helped by a wonderful happy hour. I will be coming back for more because everyone loves tacos and La Santisima does tacos well."}
{"text":"Holy delicious batman! 
These tacos were amazing! Very very filling. I only ordered two and walked away completely satisfied. They have a cornucopia of salsas! 

I wish I could tell you what I had but I could not choose so I asked out server to pick two  out for me. My coworker did the same thing.

However with his, we asked about one ( his favorite) it was the shark taco.

It's quite small so lunch time it gets very packed. I would recommend getting there a bit earlier or later than noon."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The Sur Baja Shark taco and The Gaucho taco are the bomb. Plus the Pecan Salsa with the Strawberry Salsa are amazing. Also they make their margaritas with tequila not the margarita mix. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great tacos... its a small place. But the food is great. Careful with the salsas, some are super hot!"}
{"text":"Horrible. I don't understand the ratings.  Chips we're  flavorless, salsa bar was sad and everything almost empty, after saying I was gf brought me a burrito obviously messed my order up and when they finally brought correct dish out it was cold. Seriously what a disappointment! Waitress had an attitude and just did not care. If you are used to good quality food and good service do not come here."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had. Ate the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco (pork shoulder taco) as well as the Baja Surf Dogfish Shark Taco. The pork shoulder was my favorite because of how well the marinations blended with the pork as well as the small hint of cinnamon... Fucked up good! Both tacos came with a plate of rice and beans.  As mentioned before the pork shoulder taco has cinnamon in it which my girlfriend is allergic to so she switched if for the Sonoran Carne Asada Taco. The carne asada was well done and you could taste the mesquite charcoal it was made on. The salsa bar is another reason why this restaurant is good, due to  how diverse it was. There were so many salsas that we couldn't test them all before the chips ran out; can't remember the names of all of them, but the peanut salsa was awesome."}
{"text":"Man this place is BOMB. They have a ton of salsas. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing. Good prices, consistently excellent food and friendly/helpful staff. 

First off, you pick your own salsas, whaaa!? the salsa bar - strawberry salsa! pecan salsa! cilantro salsa! so so so many to choose from and always fresh. 

My favorite burrito is the Mahi mahi specialty, but the Mole, and veggie are also a hit. 

I have been going to this restaurant since I moved out here over 1 year ago and continually recommend it.

Make sure you get a Horchata if you are in the mood for a sweet drink. It has melon, strawberries and pecans in it! Delicious and worth trying!

Now go and tell all your friends about this place."}
{"text":"Current favorite Mexican place in Phoenix. Will have a spot on the permanent rotation. Have tried 3 types of their tacos so far and none of them disappoint, but the fish tacos have to be my favorite so far."}
{"text":"Great tacos.  Burrito was good but bit salty.   Doesn't look like much from outside but we had great lunch there."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent.  The atmosphere is fun and they have a great salsa bar."}
{"text":"It is the superlative bean and cheese burrito in Phoenix! Classic taste and the refried beans are not cooked in lard, which is nice for vegetarians to know and whatever oils they use give them a good savory taste. No bland beans here! If dairy is not your thing, the Ghandi Vegan burrito has fresh guacamole and black beans matched by no other. And if the entrees weren't enough, there is also THE best salsa bar of all time. The red chipotle salsa must have some sort of addictive substance in it, as I cannot stop at just two servings. 
The service is top notch and the atmosphere is mellow. 
My only issue is that it's kinda hard to see from the road. But you can see the sign pretty easy if you're looking for it."}
{"text":"This place was such a pleasant surprise. The food was absolutely delicious, the salsa bar was great, and the grapefruit margarita was super refreshing. Will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"1st time at this restaurant I was surprised they make you wait outside the building for a table.  Because it's  really small inside, 10 total tables... 30 minute guarantee wait.  Noticed two dirty tables were available while we waited, those 2 dirty tables only sat 2.   Decent food, probably an 8/10.  Those 2 dirty tables were never cleaned until we finished eating.  By the time we were done eating 6 groups of people were waiting outside and there were 6 dirty tables waiting to be cleaned for these 6 people.  Only 10 total table in this place and they are making people wait 30 minutes just so they can get around to cleaning them.  Customers kept coming in and they would tell them 25 minute wait.   As a customer eating in the restaurant this will drive you nuts and make your experience a 4/10 and not want to come back.  Just because they make people wait outside in the heat when tables are sitting dirty for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Lunchtime is very hard to find a seat, but once you do you're treated with a great selection of unique and well-known Spanish staples. Worth the drive for lunch or dinner if you're not from the area, check out the shark tacos!"}
{"text":"Of the countless Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, it's hard to find one with an authenticity to it that brings back memories of Mexico City. Fortunately, La Condesa, an excellent taco shop in an unlikely location, succeeds. The first time I went there, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, as I had been recommended numerous times by family members and friends. 

What I noticed immediately was the eclectic selection of homemade salsas. From smoky peanut sauce to deliciously sweet avocado salsa, Condesa has just about everything a chips & salsa lover could imagine. As for the chips themselves, they're actually warm and delicious even when not dipped in one of the many salsas offered. Condesa makes you believe that the chips are being made in the kitchen right before they bring them to your table, even if this isn't the case.

The restaurant's atmosphere perfectly matches the food, with excellent music playing at all times and fascinating art adorning every wall of the room. Based mostly off of classic Mexican art and architecture, La Condesa is beautiful to look at it if you decide to dine alone. Even if you are with friends or family, the many art pieces hung around the room will surely spark a conversation; they're all gorgeous and full of Mexican history.

For the main course, I had a Veggie Burrito with a side of rice and refried beans. Just about everything was absolutely delicious, and pouring a little bit of salsa on it made it even tastier. The beans weren't very full of flavor but were definitely enjoyable especially when eaten with the rice and burrito. 

Since my first visit, I've tried a variety of foods at Condesa but my favorite so far has to be the Shark Meat Burrito. Before trying it there I had never eaten shark meat before and always wondered what it could taste like. To my surprise, it was actually delicious and made for the perfect filling to an already delicious burrito filled with mushrooms, spinach, melted cheese, and garlic.

To drink I only had a pink lemonade, but the person I came with had Condesa's famous Horchata. While I'm used to the delicious and legendary Horchata from Mexico, I did enjoy the Horchata at Condesa, even if it wasn't as perfect as some of the more authentic renditions that I've tried over the past couple of years. 

The fountain drinks are served in large cups, the kinds that you see in gas stations directly off the freeway, complete with a plastic lid and straw. Of course, the presentation wasn't anything fancy, but the cup is so large that needing a refill is unlikely, something I enjoyed (especially when the place is extremely busy, making it near impossible to get speedy service).

This brings me to my final, and only entirely negative, point. Where Condesa is lacking is in the service. While all the servers are very nice and accommodating, the food has a tendency to take a while to get to the table, especially if the restaurant is busy. With room for about 20 or 30 people at the very most, Condesa is a small restaurant, one that operates with a maximum wait staff of about three at all times. 

The best advice I can give you is to take your trip to Condesa before the lunch rush, or before the dinner rush. The enjoyable experience of the food and atmosphere will be quickly deflated once the restaurant reaches 65% capacity or more. The tables are far too close together and eavesdropping on another group's dinner conversation is entirely unavoidable. It's best to not come with massive groups, as the restaurant prides itself on its intimacy. 

Anyone looking to try authentic Mexican food should come to Condesa immediately. While I'm one to enjoy places like Filiberto's almost any day of the week, the experience you'll have at Condesa is one that few other restaurants in Phoenix can offer. The prices aren't extremely high, and the food is worth every penny."}
{"text":"This place is delicious we got tacos and a burrito both came with plenty of meat and choice of rice and beans. The salsa bar is amazing so much to choose from and the staff is super friendly. This place is also family friendly which is a plus since it's very difficult to go out with a baby. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I love the food here, ans their salsa bar is always kept stocked and clean.  Every time I have visited the restaurant there is a bit of a wait time, but it is worth it.  Portions are pretty well for price of food (which is reasonable).   I live closer to their location in Glendale but will rather drive to this location due to better service, food and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Small joint, delicious food. You must try the Mole Quesadilla, I've never had anything like it, and it was the best thing I have ever eaten, maybe in my life! We thought about ordering a couple to take home, but we didn't (but we should have!!). We also tried 4 of their tacos, you can't go wrong with any choice. On the way out, we ordered the horchata and it was great. Lots of cinnamon, just sweet enough, good for a dessert. There are some fruit bits in there, and I am usually not a fan of stuff flying up the straw like that, but it was fine. There is also a large salsa bar, many varieties to choose from. I'm looking forward to going back to this place."}
{"text":"I came here expecting yummy food after a long flight from Miami and I was so disappointed! First of all, let me start by saying this is not a $ sign place, I would say more like $$. We ordered an horchata, which was pretty good (but then again I've never had one before so... no comparison there). We ordered the mix and match tacos and all I can say is I don't ever want to try mexican food again. I'm cuban, so I know about flavor and good hispanic cooking, but these were not blah! There was no flavor, out of the 3 mini tacos I ordered the only one with SOME flavor was a chicken one that was loaded with onions and spicy sauce. So you can guess, it simply tasted spicy. Overall, if you find another place with good reviews go there. I thought this place would be great due to the 1000+ reviews and the 4.5 rating, but I was greatly disappointed and ended up paying $40 for 6 mediocre, small tacos and a drink!"}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance and the different salsas but the food could've been seasoned a lot more. I ordered one of the veggie burro and it had great potential, just lacked seasoning until I added salsa. I will definitely be trying this again though."}
{"text":"It's a good little place with a nice authentic vibe. Certainly plenty of salsa options - ranging from acceptable to pretty good, but you can't argue with the variety.

I thought the roasted pork shoulder taco was flavorful and delicious. Found the black mole chicken taco to be a bit too bitter, but the meat was tender and good. Enough salsa verde on top got the job done.

$2 negra modelo on Sunday was a bonus.

Certainly worth eating. Especially for $10."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! My husband and I were in the area and decided to stop simply because of the Yelp reviews, it didn't disappoint! The service was great - we were immediately greeted and our drink orders taken right away. We both ordered the horchata - wow! Such a delicious twist to the already yummy drink. I ordered the mole quesadilla and my husband had a pastor bowl, both delicious, seasoned perfectly and pretty darn close to being authentic Mexican food. This place is a must - parking is limited as is the seating space inside, but worth it. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Well I went to GOAZMOTORCYCLES and purchased another bike from these guys. you absolutely cannot go wrong dealing with these Guys and Gals. Best deal in the valley and I would not even waste a day going any were else.
Total pros and awesome deals. I think they have a dealer to sell and service any make and model. I purchased a new 2016 Kawasaki Vaquero.(GREAT BIKE)
And if you know you want a bike but not quite sure if its the right bike for you thay have lots of experience and WILL LET YOU TEST RIDE."}
{"text":"Yum! I wish their space was bigger and had something further on the northside but that is honestly the only thing I can say negative about this place. I have never had anything that I didn't like. Everyone who's visited me has wanted to come back to Phoenix to eat these tacos. If you go during a normal meal time expect to wait probably at least an hour. But it's all worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and always felt satisfied after each visit. I love the atmosphere and the design of the dining area, great art. The baja shark tacos and quesadillas are to kill for. huge variety of different salsas and the horchata is a one of kind with pecans and pieces of fruit. The waitresses are always attentive and polite. Nice selection of beers as well."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here.  The layers of flavors in my Al Pastor, Tinga and Carne Asado Tacos were awesome!  My only complaint was I was expecting it to be less expensive based on the single $ on yelp.  I think this should be updated to $$.  (I didn't mind paying what I did at all, it was totally worth it, but the expectation based on what I had read here was in my head.)"}
{"text":"This place is hands down awesome! 

The salsa they make is really tasty and unique. They have flavors I've never dreamed of like strawberry salsa.  Every time I go there they have something new and exciting to try. 

I've had the tacos and burritos (which were both amazing), but I think the tacos are a little better (plus you get a side of beans which are about as good as you can get anywhere). 

My only complaint is you only get one basket of chips for free and they charge for additional refills. Oh well."}
{"text":"The things I like best about La Condesa (other than the decor - I love the imagery of Dia de los Muertos and Catrina):   their delicious homemade horchata, garnished authentically with bits of melon and pecans;  their many unusual varieties of homemade salsas (jicama, peanut, pecan, berry, every type of chile/tomato combination... All of them tasty); and their thick-rolled, flavorful quesas.  In the land of a thousand Mexican restaurants, they bring a fresh spin to the cuisine and the food is awesome.   Totally worth bumping elbows with one's fellow patrons a bit in the tight dining room."}
{"text":"So I get why this place gets 4.5 stars, the tacos are fabulous!!!!! Yep, 5 exclamation marks good. The tacos are gourmet. I tried the mahi mahi (grilled, I'm not sure if there is a fried version) and the veggie taco. Hmm, they are both equally good; I can't pick one over the other. I can say that the Pecan salsa helped out the fish taco with a nice spiciness and gave it that pizzazz it needed to set it apart. 

This is my first visit to La Condesa so, I'm not sure how the place works, but from what I gather you just walk-in and grab a seat then a server will eventually get to you. It was a Sunday evening when we stopped by and there was only 1 SERVER!!! Poor thing was running all over the place. I don't blame her for not getting to us with the first few minutes we sat down. After a little bit she regained her composure and was friendly and accommodating. She really shouldn't of been the only person serving the place was hopping as one group left another entered. There was no one standing around waiting for a place to sit, and honestly I don't know where they would wait. 

The paintings on the walls are amazing. Great art work to look at. However, I was seated at the bar and faced empty bar shelves and the light above me was out, so it was very dim. So as far as ambiance, it just wasn't quite working for me. 

Back to the food.. The refried beans could use some improvement. Okay, so I am Hispanic and have been eating beans since birth and I have never had beans so watered down. It was more of a cold bean soup. Maybe that's what La Condesa was going for, but that didn't work for me either. The rice was good and warm.  

I enjoyed the salsa bar. So many salsas, Cilantro (like), Pico (like), Pecan (like), Peanut, Mexican (like), the list goes on!!

I would visit this place again with the hopes that I get a table next time!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and start eating here (if you're not already a fan).

#1. Hands down best salsa bar on the PLANET!!!

If I can help it, I eat here at least 2x/week. I literally order the same thing every single time and it never gets old: veggie tacos and horchata, both of which have ruined any other Mexican restaurant for me... nothing comes even close to their glorious flavors, and it's always fun picking and mixing the different salsas with the food.

The super chill and friendly staff and unique atmosphere are also worth mentioning.

Seriously, I hesitate to leave Phoenix because of this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here this past weekend for the first time. We had been wanting to try it, but hadn't gotten around to it. We are glad we finally took the time to have dinner here. It was really good.  The tacos were fabulous, the margaritas were good and the choices of salsa were great. The service is a little slow, so if you're in a hurry pick another time to visit this wonderful establishment. I definitely will be returning and bringing friends and family!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, full of favor. Also have a great salsa bar."}
{"text":"Liked the artsy decor and slightly unusual taco selections.  Would have preferred 3 rather than 2 tacos in the combos.  I had the Cabo shrimp and the conchita pilbil tacos.  Both very good but neither knocked my socks off.   The various salsa were indentified by signs while I was there and lots of fun to test against my tacos (even though I ended up preferring the most standard versions).  The strawberry salsa is a definite must - astounding to get strawberry taste and heat at the same time and it works!"}
{"text":"Been driving by this place for some time, and finally I decided to try it. I was skeptical at first because the parking isn't very inviting. The restaurant is somewhat small but yet quaint. I was very excited to try all the salsa's but was utterly disappointed when the chips they brought us were hard, stale, and just not suitable for eating. I think they were some of the worst chips I have ever had, I had one.. I requested another basket and they kindly bought another basket of chips but they were the same, Stale, hard and dull. I ordered the Aztec Tinga Taco, and they were very good. The salsa's were all great. The service was great, and the waitress apologized for the chips, and stated that they had ran out and had to buy some etc, etc.. Overall tacos were great for the money, just disappointed with the chips."}
{"text":"Street Tacos - Yum!  Friend had the verde burrito and it was HUGE for her!  The three street tacos I had were really flavorful (not too spicy).  Rice and beans are great... next time I am thinking request extra rice and beans!"}
{"text":"These are not your buddy's street tacos.
La Condesa hits the nail on the head when it comes to flavor. Cochinita Pibil that tastes like Cochinita Pibil... though I would be fine with a little more achiote.
The tinga is great, with citrusy notes on top of slow cooked beef full of chorizo and onion flavor--don't worry, the onion sweetens it up.

My personal favorite is the baja shrimp taco. Big juicy pieces of breaded shrimp stuffed into two corn tortillas with cabbage and mayo on top.

My only point of contention; they should warn people that more than two tacos is actually quite a lot of food. It would help get over the sticker shock. Beans and rice are unnecessary.

A suggestion: Provide people with suggestions for salsa/taco pairings and make everyone drink the fruity horchata, it's awesome."}
{"text":"My family decided once a month we will try a new place. We came across this restaurant that was right down the road from us. They have the best horchata in town!!! Their Azteca soup was so delicious and their portions were enormous. The service was perfect. Attended to all of our needs while also letting us enjoy our meal. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time with family and friends last Saturday. We all got something different and delicious. The salsa bar was really fun to explore and we ended up sampling all the different salsas. The guacamole was delicious and chunky and you could see all the fresh ingredients - no fillers here. 

There were so many different burritos and tacos to try and you could even make things into bowls. While not everyone in our party was a vegetarian, we had two and I'm vegan. They had multiple menu items for both, which was amazing and extremely rare for an authentic Mexican restaurant. I tried the cauliflower taco and Gandhi taco (black beans and more) and they were delicious!

We'll be back again to continue exploring the menu."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've ever had. The street tacos are the best. Good friendly service too. Small though so hard with big groups."}
{"text":"Oh My Goodness!!
Husband is Mexican - we're from Chicago - have NEVER had such fabulous food outside of Mexico City! Were there on vaca and went one night - loved the tacos (the Tinga chicken was SOOOO tasty!) and the salsas are so fun and interesting and tasty!

Had to go back one more time before we left and ordered the DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS!!! O.M.G. pas deaux - it was AH MAY ZING!!! One of the best fried foods I have ever tasted - and the cheese, and the chicken tinga..... mmmmmmm - 

Booking another flight to Phoenix as I write this...."}
{"text":"What a great hole in the wall.  Cool vibe, very clean and an AMAZING burrito!  Had the Mahi Mahi, it was awesome, and the descriptions of the ingredients in the other items will grab your attention.  For what it is, plus some, it does not get any better!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while, and they've expanded their seating since last time.  So, we didn't have to wait long. Everything still tastes good, but you really have to bring it for tacos in this town, more so every day. Service is still slow."}
{"text":"This place makes the best horchatas, we  had Their tinga, carne asada, and pastor tacos and they were dang delicious all the meats had so much flavor, if I wasn't so full I would have ordered 6 more tacos, I also ordered their house lonche. It's pretty much a torta. 

That one so good nice crunchy bread, and the Oaxaca cheese was so soft and full of flavor.
Will definitely be coming back for more 
Thank you guys for the great service"}
{"text":"OH....MY....JESUS. Ya'll mind if I praise God real quick?! This food is amazing!!!! Literally in shock of how amazing everything tastes! The best Mexican food I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service u can ever imagine and what type of Mexican restaurant can't make guacamole because they ran out of tomatos?!?"}
{"text":"I discovered this place on a whim when we were driving around central Phoenix a few weeks ago. It had a cool Dia de los Muertos skull on the sign and I thought someone had told me about it so we stopped in for a weekend lunch. 

Our server was super nice and explained about their awesome salsa bar as everyone else here has commented on. I loved the chipotle tomatillo salsa, while my husband preferred the pico de gallo and my daughter (who is 2) could not get enough of the creamy cilantro one. I had the Condesa special tacos which were awesome, especially when topped with some of that chipotle tomatillo salsa. 

What was really outstanding though was the horchata. So outstanding that after finishing mine in the restaurant, I ordered another one to go. It's not like any horchata that I've ever had before as it was kind of light brown in color and had lots of chopped up fruit and nuts in it. I would go back just for the horchata!"}
{"text":"OMG....love this place! Best salsa bar and the burritos are grilled and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Fresh ingredients & great taste! The quesadillas are my favorite, filled with cheese! My One Complaint: I was seated by the salsa bar next to the wall & somehow ended with white all over my jeans & jacket! Very inconvenient since now I have to go back home before going to work because it doesn't come off easily!"}
{"text":"It's small and cramped inside,  but the food is great. The tacos are huge and delicious. Also,  the quesadillas are gigantic,  easily shared by two people. And of course the salsa bar is the best in the valley."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday around 6 pm!! When we went inside there were maybe two other tables seated!! They made us wait for five minutes before they set us!! I'm not sure how they have so many good reviews!! The best thing they have is the salsa!! Not sure if they don't have help or they don't hire because it was the worst I have seeing!! We waited about 40 minutes for our food!! The steak tacos were disgusting!! The beer was hot!! My son only had couple of bites of his burrito!! And he can eat!! When we left there were at least 10 tables open and  there were at least 20 people waiting inside and outside!!  I just don't get it!! I have so much to say but I'm going to leave it at this!! Never ever going there again!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable tacos... Some of the best I have ever tasted.  I recommend the pork and carbs asada.   Service and employees were friendly.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is an awesome, quaint artsy restaurant nestled just slightly off the Historic Glendale strip with a casual vibe and truly delicious food. 

We visited on a quiet night and had attentive service, since we were the only other guests other than a large family gathering in the center. The number of patrons, however, is no reflection on the food or experience. 

We split two, two-taco plates for maximum sampling--chicken black mole, la santisma with shrimp, chicken tinga, and pork pibil...all of which were delicious. The la santisma, loaded with veggies and cheese was the overall winner (and was the one recommended by our waiter). Also, being a mole fan, I was excited to eat a REALLY good mole! 

I only wish there was one closer, because I would eat here wayyyy to often. The salsa bar is out of this world if you are a salsa nut like myself. Sooo many options, all for the tasting. Ever had a delish jicama and cilantro salsa? How about the less common radish salsa, which was outstanding? Not to mention the other 10+ salsas on the bar, including a spicy guac. Many of these have quite the kick, so this may not be for the faint of heart. 

Lastly, the house margarita was tasty and we both loved the mixed citrus, including lemons, limes, orange and grapefruit. This is not a \"knock-you-on-your-a$$\" bev, but probably the tastiest mixed drink I've had in a long time. So fresh, crisp and well-made for enjoyment. 

I will be making the trip back again and again. Yum..."}
{"text":"Great tacos and the rice tasted great.  Had the 3 tacos rice and beans.  The chicken tacos were very tasty the one meat taco was little on the chewy side but still very good.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and always enjoy the food. My only complaint is the service. Its not horrible but definitely not great. I would still recommend it for the food."}
{"text":"Street tacos were good but a little overpriced. Ordered a Yerba Buena tea whatever almost choked on the stem of the lemon. So not so Buena after all. Salsa bar was cool but they were pretty much out of everything. Not the best experience. Place is very aesthetic lots of art. Food and drinks ok."}
{"text":"love the salsa bar but service can be WAY slow during peak hrs. THEY NEED MORE HELP!! Food is fantastico!! Try it but avoid peak hrs."}
{"text":"Long wait, but VERY worth it. Chicken mole was divine, a wide range of fantastic salsas, excellent house margarita. The absolute best Mexican food I've ever had. yum!"}
{"text":"I'm a salsa fan, and this place must have had 20 fresh salsas just waiting to be enjoyed. I tried most of them and they were excellent. Five stars for the salsas alone. The tacos were great - mole, shrimp, etc.."}
{"text":"Had the 3 Street taco plate, Al Pastor, Carne Asada & Cochinita Pibil. Delicious! Wife had the La Santisima veggie taco plate. Very hardy for veggie only. The salsa bar selection was awesome, all very tasty. The wait staff was attentive, knowledgeable on the dishes. Used a Groupon for this introductory visit. Will so be coming back."}
{"text":"I grew up in the SW but have loved in the NE for 20+ years. Also worked in a Mexican restaurant during high school and college. This was the best Mexican food I can recall. I had Queso Fundido with Choizo and Poblanos, paired with a 3-taco platter of Baby Shark, Tiger Shrimp and Mahi."}
{"text":"i love this place great serviice great food could be cleaner though , its always so busy there isn't tim to clean up lol but other than that it great love coming here :)"}
{"text":"Ok, some of the salsa sound a little strange. Try them. They are awesome. Mole tacos are delicious, so are the dog fish ones. The burros are huge. Great service, even when busy. The horchata is a nice way to finish a meal."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place a bunch lately.  At least 15 trips to eat and it has been unbelievably good every time!"}
{"text":"We drive across the valley to eat here.  Very good food.  Simple, warm tasty and friendly people.  Good work!!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. I've hadn't taste such a delicious taco for a long time."}
{"text":"It's nice and spicy with hand-hewn wood decor and interesting recipes and salsas, but after two visits I have to say it's just not all that fabulous.

The tortillas are factory, not freshly made.

The salsa bar has a lot of options, but nothing on the bar stood out as much better than anything you'd find on Baja Fresh's salsa bar.

Service was confusing and wait staff was confused. Transition from counter service to table service after the lunch hour wasn't handled well. I was seated and given a menu but no one took my order, so I ordered and paid at the counter. Then at the end of the meal, other waiters kept asking if I wanted to pay my check.

La Condesa is good enough, but I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"I'm updating and improving the review. 
According to the proprietor, the cause of my last bad experience is gone, so I decided to return with some coworkers today. I was offered a free meal, but I declined it. 
The service was much improved, efficient even. The food is very tasty. It is a taco experience that is quite a bit better than most Phoenix locations. A lot of their food tends to be on the spicy side, but not all. The house-made beverages (horchata and jamaica) are very good. The guac is chunky and very citrusy, which I approve of. Do not hesitate to check this place out, but be forewarned that parking can be challenging and the location is small and crowded. Nonetheless it has one-of-a-kind ambiance and outstanding Mexican food and drink."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp. I just received an email with Yelpers' reviews of Burritos. Usually the recommendations are far and away or not fitting my food mood. However, La Condesa was right in my wheelhouse. 

The location is ok, but the interior is spotless and fun. Lots of Day of the Dead and Luce Libre to enjoy while you choose salsa from the 12 or so available. Did I mention that there are a lot of salsas? For a condiment king like me, this is heaven. Peanut and Pecan Salsa, WHAT!?! Both were tasty and new flavors. Mayan Cochinita Burro jumped off the menu. I had beverage ordering anxiety and caved to the Horchata. Best Horchata I've had. There are nuts, strawberries and other tasty floaters in it. The burro came, and it was lava-esque. I couldn't touch it for 20 mins. Luckily I had salsafest 2011 to keep me busy. The burro finally returned from the sun and it tasted delicious. Melt in your mouth stewed pork and refried beans in a possibly homemade tortilla. I'll be back. 

$12 Food, drink and Salsafest."}
{"text":"Holy *%#*!!! The mole is legit! Best I've ever had. Everything else is also quite tasty, but the mole is what's to write home about."}
{"text":"Got here at around 2pm on Sunday and had to wait a hour to get seated. So get here early! Food was awesome only down side is they need more staff. Overall we had a good experience"}
{"text":"We live in  Glendale and was excited to go here. Akward small salsa bar. No one greeted us as we came in. Self seating I assume. Who works here? No uniforms.  Nasty standing water by salsa bar. This food better be good! Weird way to get to the salsa bar where you have to twist and turn. No utensils or napkins on tables. You have to ask and wait.  

Positive.  Music and atmosphere is good. The outside patio looks nice. The prices are decent and they look to have a good vision. They have really nice art work but walls need painting.  Seating is good and looks nice wooden tops and cast iron details.

A bit more attention to details and some training will have this a destination for Glendale folks who want authenticity yet do not want to go near the hustle and bustle of Westgate."}
{"text":"I tried both the machaca and shredded chicken tacos - barely edible!  The shredded cabbage looked to be a week old on the overcooked beef, which did not really qualify as machaca.  The shredded chicken was swimming in a tasteless red sauce. 

The combo platter promises rice & beans - more like thimble-fuls of white rice and bean soup.

I will say that their chips and salsa bar was great, but the rest was awful!"}
{"text":"Omg! The specialties tacos were to die for!  I want to try everything on the menu! The prices are just right, you are paying for quality food!  The Chile Verde burrito is big enough for 2! Very tasty! Lots of art to admire as well!"}
{"text":"OMG, came 2 weeks in a row.  I had to bring the rest of the family to try this place. My favorite was the specialties tacos! The burritos are fabulous and the salsas are to die for,  be careful they will make you cry!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and amazing horchata! 

The salsa bar was fresh, and it was really fun to try out different salsas. The Horchata and the Jamaica come in huge cups and are both excellent. I had the Mayan pork and Chicken mole tacos. They were delicious and filling."}
{"text":"La Santisima is easily one of the best taco shops in the Phoenix area. The menu is fresh and interesting,  with dishes taken from various areas in southern Mexico. If you want to try new and authentic flavors, this is the place. 

It's simple and unique, with a minimal staff and barebones table settings, but you somehow feel a sense of \"rightness\". It's no frills, no fluff, just great Mexican food for a price you can't match. I'd rather pay 9 bucks for an amazing burrito and eat my salsa out of a plastic bowl than visit a snazzy upscale place with food that's no better but have to shell out twice the price. 

Go. To. La. Santisima."}
{"text":"This place has at least 3 different names: La Condesa on Yelp, La Santisima on the front of the building, and Santa Santisima on the menu.  Call it whatever you want, just find the place.  It's so good, my friends and I came here twice during our trip, on the word of some locals we met at JoBot Coffee.  It's a really small place, so expect a wait unless you happen to get lucky and pop in at a slow time.  The guacamole is stupid good, as are the shark and pork tacos.  If you're really hungry, skip the 2 taco platter (just adds rice and beans) and get a third taco, or order the guac."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!! Regular sized tortillas, really authentic and tasty! $3.99/taco. 2 Taco Plate  w/rice & beans $8.97 plate."}
{"text":"Los peores tacos de mi vida, yo soy de México en específico de la Ciudad de México y vaya que conocemos de tacos los de la ciudad y en lo personal yo como muchísimos tacos.Desconozco que calidad tengan el resto del menú pero en lo personal los tacos no fueron de mi gusto en lo más mínimo el suadero no sabe a sudadero, el pastor no sabe a pastor en fin etc etc.Tuvimos que esperar un poco pasado de 1 hora para que nos entregarán la orden de 6 tacos 4 para mí y 2 para mí novia que por cierto está vomite y vomite y con mucho dolor estomacal.En lo personal no volvería jamás"}
{"text":"Service is absolutely dismal. First we waited 40 minutes on a Sunday night because they barely have any seating. Once we did get a table they were quick to bring chips. Only chips. The waiter never mentioned the salsa bar. I knew it was there but still. Then they didn't take a drink order. After waiting for 5 minutes we walked up to the bar area and begged for water. Last thing I wanted to do was eat chips with salsa without something to drink for over 45 minutes. Another 10 minutes went by before they finally decided to take our order. Then the wait began to get our drinks. It took another 15 minutes to get our drinks--sodas, nothing fancy. This was after we watched the waiter make plenty of other drinks for other tables. He made 3 margaritas for a table that got there after us. Finally after one hour and 45 minutes our food arrived."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in a quaint setting. Excellent  tacos and burros. Horchata is original, well worth the try."}
{"text":"The mole in this place was orgamical!!!' My eyes rolled back in my head and I almost screamed out!!! The salsa bar?!?!? Forget about it!!! Crazy Mo fo good!!!  If I lived in Arizona I'd live in this place!!! Jesus our waiter, the f$&kin best!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, I had the three street tacos plate with rice and beans. The rice and beans are some of the best I've ever had. I had Tinga, Al Pastor and carne asada tacos and they all were delicious. Salsa bar is also great and it has a wide variety of options. Definitely recommend this place when in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place! We go here every chance we get. I've lived in the neighborhood for 5 years now, and haven't found anything better. Le Santisima is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Best food this side of the Colorado. Al pastor Quesadilla and mole tacos were off the chain. And their tamarindo margarita was the best ever. Will drive from San Diego just for it. Salad bar has so many options"}
{"text":"We dined here last night and I can't say enough good things.  The menu was full of delicious options, with a flexible ordering scheme.  Ala carte tacos are large and come with two tortillas, so they are easy to share.  Plates come with two of the large tacos with wonderful refried beans and tender rice.  We had the Gaucho, which is an Argentine marinated steak taco with fresh avocado, and the Oaxacan chicken mole taco- unbelievable!  The best part is the salsa bar- amazing flavors and textures.  Light and tasty tortilla chips are complimentary.  The decor is quirky and fun, with really nice furniture. The service was friendly and attentive, and the price was very reasonable- lots of food, one drink each for 5 people for $60."}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers! I was searching for mexican late at night and was really craving something authentic. I struck gold with La Condesa.  It is a true diamond in the rough part of phoenix.
I ordered the carne asada burrito which is simply meat and beans. Anywhere else that would be boring and plain, but it was seasoned perfectly and full of flavor. A perfect vessel for the salsa bar from heaven. Every bite was different depending on what spicy concoction I chose.
I also couldn't resist trying the maya conchita pibil taco, which was packed full of juicy shredded pork. So juicy in fact that I had to eat it quick because the corn tortillas were getting a bit soggy. Did I mind? Oh no. I just sopped up any juice left and sighed with pure contentment. They topped the taco with nothing else but pickled red onions that were delicious. Simple done right.  Can't wait to go back and get that horchata!"}
{"text":"Walking into this small restaurant, i could image I was in a nice part of Mexico City.  Showing up with my customary crew of three little boys, you can imagine some people would be annoyed, but our hostess greeted us kindly and found us the space to sit down. They didn't mind at all that we had to park the stroller at the small bar.
The boys were hungry monsters and we got baskets of chips right away. I found several lovely non spicy salsas for the boys, including a pecan salsa, cilantro salsa, and strawberry salsa. We ordered a mole taco, shark taco, and pibil taco with a side of rice and beans to share among us. It was plenty for two adults, two little ones and a very picky 8 yr old who just ate chips. Each taco was awesome.each was  Realy  unique in flavors. The beans and rice were both boring and bland. All salsas were delicious. It almost didnt m atter what we ate because it was all so delish.
The decor was very appealing, although the walls were pretty dirty. The service was good, the music good and rather loud, which helped to drown out the baby pulverizing chips with his fists. This is not wat I would categorize as a good place to take kids, but even so, they were tolerated, and I am just not going to miss trying a place like this because I have my kids with me. 
The only drawback for me was that this is a SMALL place, and it was hot and airless inside. I don't know if the air conditioning was broken, but just a room fan would have helped a lot. We were sweating by the end of the meal, and not from the pico de gallo. I hope they get that worked out before summer melts the asphalt."}
{"text":"The food was very good and very fresh.  Trying out the different salsas was cool - I have never eaten anywhere that had that.  The price was right!  I had a huge meal, beer and horchata for $20.  That said, the food did not blow my mind. 4 stars seems about right."}
{"text":"Keeping this brief..


Went for lunch on Monday after a co-workers recommendation and was blown away by how good the Cochinita Pibil Burro was.  The pork shoulder is marinated in achiote, orange and a bunch of other stuff and was unbeleivably tender.  Great tortillas as well.  My Mexican buddy declared it some of the best meat he has ever eaten.

The salsa bar had some pretty interesting stuff in it and everything I tried was great, including marinated onions and two different salsa verdes.  A plus was the Pico was pretty spicy, with large chunks of Jalapeno in it.  

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Loved the salsa bar - we went with another couple and we ate 3 baskets of chips because we had so much fun sampling all the salsas. My wife and I shared the burrito and she wasn't even able to finish half of a burrito - great serving sizes. The only downside was the place was packed and nowhere to wait for a table inside. Looking forward to going back though!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! it has become one my fav spots since I moved to AZ from Cali. The horchata is amazing!!! and so is everything else. I highly recommend the cabo shrimp tacos. And you can't beat their signature margaritas. And last but not least their salsa bar. OMG delicious!! My go to is the pecan salsa. So many to choose from."}
{"text":"My mouth just died and went to heaven. Great atmosphere.  Great salsa bar. Great margaritas. Great tacos. When I'm on my deathbed in the distant future I will die happy. Knowing that I indeed experienced life!"}
{"text":"Good \"upscale\" mexican fast food, if that makes any sense.  Lots of great flavors to be had.  Mixing and matching with the unique salsas (peanut, pecan, cilantro and jicama salsas are standouts) allows for some pretty awesome flavor combinations.

Sort of an odd place, because it the menu feels like it should be a takeout or order-and-take your seat kind of place, but it has a beautiful wood bar that seems wasted on the environment.  If they do carry beer, it isn't in an obvious place (no taps, no display refridgerator).  And they appear to only carry one type of wine.

Just think of the drinks as afterthoughts and enjoy the variety of food you are able to enjoy..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are here visiting in AZ for the holiday weekend and we found this AWESOME place!!!! So stoked when we walked in and saw Guy Fierri's photo Nd signature. The place did not disappoint (although I'll admit we did question it at first because of the way it looked on the outside and the area...) The meat and salsas from the salsa bar were D E L I C I O U S !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It is always crowded but we go early to avoid the wait. Street tacos with fresh ingredients and so many options!!! Everything is yummy here. I also love the salsa bar and like to have several different salsa to go with the complimentary chips."}
{"text":"Great food awful service.  Looked like only one waitress and one helper. So I felt sorry for her but I was completely forgotten after being there for over 30 minutes had to go ask for her to come out and take my order. The only reason I waited is because I was starving and when I got there I did order a beer from The Host and that did come right away. No one ever checked to see how my food was and when I was finished I waited another 15 minutes and no one came so I went inside and got my check."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Service was just too slow. Waited approx. 20mins just to order my drink. Otherwise it was good"}
{"text":"In area for personal reason. Asked a local where to find some good eats. Without hesitation he said \"La Santisima\"! Easily found the building using smartphone maps. Walked in on a Saturday afternoon to a bustling restaurant that is so small I had to chuckle. Without looking at a menu ordered 3 fish tacos and a bottled coke. While waiting, i loaded up on the condiments. Got my order in a reasonable time and bicycled to Coronado park to feast. Hands down, the best fish tacos i have had. California, Hawaii and New Mexico cannot compete with these fish tacos. Did not know this \"gem\" was featured on D,D & D. Any person who fails to give 5 starts is just being a pinche pendeho. And the neighborhood is NOT SKETCHY!!! Brown people don't bite. You can't ask for better food, faster service or tastier condiments."}
{"text":"Dogfish tacos: legit. 8 out of 10. (FYI - Dogfish are little sharks.)

Shrimp tacos: also legit. Also 8 out of 10.

Carne asada tacos: Dry, and I didn't pick up on much seasoning. 5 out of 10. My points of comparison here are Aqui Con El Nene in Tucson, and El Guero Canelo, also in Tucson. They're much better at carne asada tacos. Also, America's Taco Shop is far better with this, which is their specialty.

The homemade salsas are awesome. In particular, I was blown away by the salsa cilantro, and the strawberry salsa. Yes, they have strawberry salsa."}
{"text":"Our new place to go for Mexican food. The  atmosphere reminds me of a small restaurant in Mexico. I decided to try all five of the street tacos, they were all really good. My favorite was the brisket. The service was great, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican spots in town. The food is great (salsa bar!) and so are the margaritas. That said, it is crammed - try to go on a night when it's less busy to avoid feeling the full brunt of that."}
{"text":"If you're a salsa lover, this place is for you.

If you're a taco lover, this place is for you.

If you're a living, breathing human person with taste buds, this place is for you.

The chicken tinga tacos are by far my favorite - super robust, smokey flavor pairs perfectly with the acidity from the pickled onions. Mmm! Plus, their salsa bar is one to write home about - get the peanut salsa, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I was glad to see new blood come into the downtown Glendale area. I spend a lot of time in this area and I'm always looking for a new spot. 

The decor and styling of the restaurant is great. I loved the paintings and lighting throughout. There is ample seating although we came on a very busy night. 

Now for the bad news. We waited nearly an hour for a total of 8 tacos between 4 people. We were told by the manager that he was sorry and he was missing two servers and a cook. Sadly I did see people leave prior to getting food due to service. I can only hope this gets addressed. 

On the good side the tacos were excellent. I ordered two steak tacos, while my friend ordered one steak and one shredded pork. He also described the steak taco as good but he said the pork was delicious. 

Great menu with lots of choices. I will go back and hope the service issue is fixed."}
{"text":"My first time here was really good the Horchata had strawberry in it and cinnamon on top. I got the shark and shrimp burrito and it had lots of flavor. The Burrito was big enough to probably share with two light eaters. The salsa bar was great I tried somethings that were outside of my normal but it was a good experience all around. Other than the place being small I have no complaints. Great place."}
{"text":"This review is based on a catering order with David. I tried to place an order for take out and that didn't work out. So, David, who I am assuming is the manager, worked a bit of magic for our out of town clients to get their damn lunch on time. Thank you, David! It was very much appreciated!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is small, casual, great food, they have Victoria beer, margaritas are just okay, salsa bar is really great, prices and portion sizes are more than reasonable. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"So today I took my family to this place based on what I had seen on Yelp and the photos. So we get there and we are told there would be a 30 min wait but there where a lot of empty tables so we wait. After 20 min we were seated and are drink order is taken! My beer dos xx it was warm and bitter. We were given chips so we went to the salsa bar only to be disappointed with the salsas taste some where even a little spoiled. Are food arrived it looked really good on our plates my wife got the chicken mole tacos  meal. The tacos were really good! The beans were also starting to spoil and the rice was less then average. For my order I got the \"santo Plato\" pastor burrito and a pastor taco. With calabas on the side the calabas was the only thing good on my plate! My pastor burrito meat was burnt and I know they do it intentionally to give it a little flavor but they over did it. It tasted like I was eating coal. As for the service it was good they came to you with a smile. As of now I will maybe try there other location in the hopes that it will be better."}
{"text":"I hate to write this review, but what happened on July 21st, 2012 at lunch has made absolutely sure I will never eat here again.

We went in for lunch, and it all went wrong on so many levels.

1. It took them almost 20 minutes to get us chips and drinks.
2. It took another 20 to get our order.
3. Then just as our food was coming out, they had the audacity to ask us to MOVE TO ANOTHER TABLE AS OUR FOOD CAME OUT!
4. We had the Lonches, and the bread was so stale that you couldn't eat it.

I have never, ever had this happen anywhere in the world. Its considered sacrosanct in the world of food service that once a customer is seated, barring an emergency, that you don't move the patrons. Yet, a group of 8 land roving manatees with bad prison tattoos garnered enough respect in this place to get the manager to force us to move.

Now if you do fuck up this badly during a service, you comp the meal and you apologize. This is scripture when it comes to food service, and you don't defy this logic.

Yet, no apology, no offer to make it right, no nada.

I will never go back to La Condesa. We've been eating here loyally for two years, bringing in others to eat there, going out of our way to vouch for this place. Things have changed, and not for the better. 

I suggest you skip this place at all costs. Just not worth the BS and rude treatment to even risk it."}
{"text":"Pros: Full bar, salsa bar

Cons: No bartender, watery salsas, poor service.

We visited this shop for a weekend lunch.  We were starving and didn't have a lot of time, so we opted to quickly sit at the bar.  We waited 5 minutes, and a server brought us chips.  We then went and picked out a few salsas from the salsa bar.

Out of the 4 salsas I tried, I liked none of them.  They were very thin and watery, and the plastic containers are smaller than the chips - so you can only dip the corner of a chip (but the salsa won't stick), and you can't pour the salsa onto a chip (because it will run off).  The only chips that sort of work are the 'defective' folded ones. I have no idea why everyone raves about the salsa bar, perhaps for the novelty of it, but chips don't work as a salsa-delivery vehicle for watery salsa.

After 10 minutes, we still did not have water, and 15 minutes into us sitting there, we apologized and left.  Their tacos may well be amazing, but we didn't have time to sit around.  Waiting for 15 minutes (literally) with no water delivery during an AZ summer should be criminal.

There appeared to only be 2 servers for the entire restaurant, and no bartender, and they clearly couldn't handle a lunchtime rush by themselves.  Luckily, there are many other excellent taco shops in the area."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place on a whim. We looked through the pictures on yelp and the tacos looked great. As we walked in we immediately noticed that the place was like really small but the atmosphere was laid back. The menu had a huge selection of tacos, burritos, tortas and quesadillas. I had the specialty tacos with Mahi mahi. Pretty good stuff since it came with rice and beans. The salsa bar had a wide variety of salsas to choose from too."}
{"text":"Outside appearances, ho hum. Inside, interesting, but not spectacular.
But the food, ...what a surprise!! Now THATs the secret of these two places.
The food is Oahacan-leaning and terrific, and a large range of salsas to try. 
Not at all your traditional southwestern fare. 
Been to both places, and will continue to do so from time to time."}
{"text":"Oh my god, these tacos are the real deal. The mole was incredible!! And I would come back just to eat at the salsa bar! This isn't just any taco shop, these are truly gourmet. I would bring any foodie here."}
{"text":"It's a good local Mexican restaurant. Good server and lots choices of salsa. We'll come back if we visit Phoenix again.."}
{"text":"Great shark taco, mole quesadilla, salsa bar with peanut and pecan salsas, decor, and best goddamn horchata I've ever had. 

Thanks for the find, yelp!"}
{"text":"Diner's Drive-ins and Dives location...  known for their tacos and salsa bar.  Everything was tasty and the prices were good.  Service is basically counter service, but good.  The place is small, but they seem to move quickly.  Don't be surprised with a wait for a table.

Make sure to try as many salsas as you can.  The tacos were very good - I had very high expectations, and while I wasn't blown away, they were very good."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and with as many great reviews as it has.... how could it be anything less than amazing?!? Boy was I wrong! It was Sunday evening about 5 pm so I can understand the 30 min wait to be seated. I figured I would get a drink while we waited, so I ordered 2 michelada's with Tecate Light. I will confess, they were good which accounts for one of the stars I have given. By this time, I have noticed how unhappy all the employees seem to be. Would it hurt to crack a smile? Once seated, we placed our order and were given a half empty basket of chips... the chips were good and the salsa options were great! The salsa bar is what earned that 2nd star! Unfortunately, chip refills will cost you $2.70 - may have been worth is since it took some 30 min plus to get our food. The food was meh. Dull, over-priced and served cold.... like it had been sitting a while. To top it off, when we got the bill - the michelada's were $12 each!!! This place really missed the mark for me and my husband and we will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"The food was Awesome! I'd definitely come back. We sampled about 3/4 of the salsas on the complimentary salsa bar and they were all excellent, the chipotle salsa being my favorite. My burro was also excellent and very filling! Service was mediocre. I needed to ask for a refill on a fountain soda and the server forgot our order of chips to go with all of our salsas. He did eventually get us our chips and soda and made it right, so I felt satisfied when it was all said and done. Adding one more server would do wonders."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4 stars because it is unique. The night we went it was crowded...but we went because of all the hype on Yelp and my quest for Fish Tacos. The service was good. I tried all the salsa's and only liked a few. And as for the tacos...they were ok. The Shark Taco needed a better sauce and I would have enjoyed it much better. Truthfully, I didn't find the shark tacos as great as everyone else does on these reviews, but then again, I am new to Fish Tacos. I also tried the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, I found this flavor strong (unlike other Mexican places I have tried), so that is good, but I didn't really care for it.

The bad, my son ordered the steak Quesa. He didn't care for it at all, I did like this, but then the waitress took the entire thing away when we weren't done with it and Dave didn't even get a chance to try it. So that was a bit disappointing, given he didn't eat hardly any of it. 

Overall...I am glad we went."}
{"text":"You may need several visits to try all of their different gourmet tacos.  If you are indecisive about choosing among multiple great menu items like I do just get the 3-taco sampler (comes with beans & rice) and whatever three tacos jump out at you.  Then go back again and try different ones.  We got the chicken tinga, cochinita pibil (done right), Oaxacan mole negro (a flavor explosion), 2 Andalusias (chorizo and potato - hard to find a better combination), and chile en nogada (a chile stuffed with fruits, nuts and meat, topped with a sweet, creamy sauce - very different).  All were great.  Each taco has a double corn tortilla and is a pretty good size but not enormous.  I was stuffed.  Some of the more gourmet tacos are a small upcharge, but for 50 cents or a dollar per taco go ahead and splurge!
The help-yourself salsa bar had about a dozen different house-made salsas including pico de gallo, peanut, pecan, cilantro, guacamole, and many more.  My two favorites: chile de Arbol (smoky & a little spicy) and seven chiles (mild, chunky chiles and charred red onion).
Horchata: is a large 32 oz and has strawberries & almonds to make it more festive than your normal horchata.
Because this place advertises itself for \"gourmet tacos\" we didn't even look much at the rest of the large menu. A lot of people around us ordered burritos.
Location: the few parking spots out front on the main street were full so we parked down the side street, slightly nervous about the loudly-arguing people across the street, then the crazy-talking-out-loud-to-herself person with the shopping cart on the corner.  But the food was worth it and our rental car was still there and intact when we returned.
Customers included a combination of locals and tourists.  We had a twenty minute wait for a table of two around 6:30 on a Saturday night.  It was well worth the wait.  Will make it a point to try this one again when we're back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food quality is incredible. The flavors are exceptional! They are very busy but despite that the service is still very fast and efficient. Margaritas are delightful as well; we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! ALL of the food is amazing! I am a salsa freak so the FRESH salsa bar is wonderful! I always get a refreshing Michelada when I go here! If I had to pick a favorite item on the menu it would be the carne asada burrito. I love that it has just GOOD quality meat, pinto beans and thats it! Oh and they toast the out side of the tortilla to give it the perfect amount of crunch. just know that this is a small place and if you come right at dinner time especially on the weekends you will had to wait but it is soooo worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great salsa bar - I could eat their chips and salsa alone as a dinner. Yes, it's that good! Their tacos are delicious! I love taking out of town guests here because everyone is always impressed with their salsa bar selection and great food!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time today. The food is great, and so is the service. However, if you don't like fried food, don't get the quesadillas. My boyfriend had the horchata, and he says it is the best that he has ever had. The horchata is sweet, but not sickly sweet, and it has strawberries and pecans in it.

The salsa bar is awesome. You receive complimentary chips, and you can choose as many salsas as you want.

The menu has a wide variety; there is something for everyone! Even vegetarians. The dogfish taco lives up to its reputation on Yelp."}
{"text":"Great stop after getting off the plane from the airport. We were looking for something casual and delicious and this place at the spot. Great mole tacos and gordito burritos."}
{"text":"This place is hands down a hidden gem. Food is always amazing. Don't forget to order the 
Horchata! It is the best in town."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite taco places! Once in a while we get some bad pieces of meat in our gaucho tacos but generally ok. The space is very small but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I wouldn't know. After sitting at our table for 20 min with no service, i left. Thank God you can throw a rock and hit good Mexican food in this town. I went down the street to La Frontera and got real tacos"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite Mexican restaurants to eat at in Phoenix.  I recommend it every time i get the opportunity. Everything from their exceptional salsa bar to their Quesas! You will not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"This place prompted me to leave only my fifth Yelp review in like five years (shame on me, but oh well). The food was just SO good. I had the chicken mole burrito and it was about as close to \"perfect\" as it gets. They took the simple finishing step of grilling the burrito lightly, which gave it some crunch and made it taste like a non-fried chimichanga. Why don't more places do this?? The salsa bar had more options than I had time to test, but each one I sampled was delicious in its own way.

I wasn't expecting a full bar, but yep, they have one of those, too.

The atmosphere is better on the inside than you would think by looking at the outside. It's small though, so don't be surprised if there's a wait.

We will be back many times in the future!"}
{"text":"Unique, great Mexican food. Certainly not your typical, heavy tacos. The smoked marlin taco is amaz."}
{"text":"Great food! Great salsa! Did not realize it was featured on Diners Drive in and Dives! Good margaritas too!"}
{"text":"Wow where to start...
If you decide to give this place a try based on their \"good\" ratings and reviews you're better off looking elsewhere.
Me and my girlfriend were looking for ordinary tacos and when we noticed the awesome ratings and good reviews this place had achieved, we thought it would be at least decent.
When we got there and ordered our drinks, I ordered the horchata because according to people on Yelp, they had the best one could taste.
As soon as I got mine, I noticed it had some kind of canned fruit on top, if had some sort of strawberry syrup and to top it off, it had a brownish color instead of the usual white.
When I tried it, it was so sweet that one sip is all I could take before I decided to tell the waiter to take it back because I was not going to pay for that.
My girlfriend's Jamaica also had a purple color to it and she told me it tasted like grape Kool-aid.
When we were attempting to order food, all I wanted from the start was a few simple tacos...
Their tacos were $2.97 each!!!  That is absolute madness!!!
For the size of the tortilla and the quality of the taco, the MOST those could have been worth anywhere else was $1.25.
When everything was going bad and our night had been ruined, me and my girlfriend started looking around and we noticed that only white people were eating there.
Then everything made sense; white people don't know REAL mexican food, so they assume this crap quality was the \"best they had ever tasted\" and thus very good review on yelp came from white people.
If you know what real mexican food tastes like and are looking for just simple tacos, DO NOT GO TO THIS UTTERLY AMERICANIZED MEXICAN JOINT!!!!
You will be sorely disappointed.
ANY cheap taco stand in Mexico can beat the taste of these so called \"street tacos\" AND FOR A THIRD OF THE PRICE!!!
If I could I would give this place 0 stars."}
{"text":"I've had all their Tacos and they are all excellent.  My favorite are Cabo Shrimp & Oaxaca Black Mole Tacos.  The best way to enjoy the tacos in this place is to put them into rotation like in baseball and do the same with the multitudes of creative salsa.  The worse thing about La Condesa is their tacos made you wonder what the hell did you eat at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Small dining room and no waiting area, so hard to get in at peak times, but worth trying more than once to get in.  The meat is deliciously flavored and the salsa bar makes every meal fun and personalized.  Inexpensive, high quality food."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem, nestled anongst fifty more taco shops it really stands out. Their menu features dogfish shark a fliet mignon tacos that really live up to the name gourmet. The salsa bar is features approximately 20 different salsas that range from peanut to classic pico. They are however lacking in the service department as well as quality beverage choices."}
{"text":"Been twice. Authentic, high quality & great price for what you get. Salsa de Chile de Arbol was the best!! Loved the decor. Orchata tasted fresh, which is a rarity in most Mexican Restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review in hopes that management sees it or even the owner. I've been coming here for a couple of years now and my visits have been ones to remember. I was a loyal customer coming in once a week at least. The previous staff this restaurant had were amazing. You can tell they really enjoyed their job. They made me feel like I was at home. I was always taken care of by one particular server every Thursday night. Stacey, she was an outstanding employee and I enjoyed her attentiveness with us. Stacey was a hard worker and she put dedication to her job role. I decided to continue to go after she resigned but it just wasn't the same anymore. The new servers aren't polite with you. They don't listen to your concerns. They simply take your order bring your food and never check on you again. They don't ask if you need a refill or another basket of chips (most simple things a server can do). They are simply rude. It seems as if they simply want your money and want you out of there quick. Even though their food is delicious, if you don't have good service then it makes your experience horrible all around. For this reason I will not be returning but I hope this gives them a heads up to make changes and improve their service."}
{"text":"This place has jumped to number one on my Phoenix taco list.  For real, OMG, we got a Groupon and decided to redeem it today.  The salsa bar... it's freaking amazing (strawberry, chipotle/pecan, cilantro crema, and many others).  Don't even get me started on the horchata.  I had NOTHING bad, or even average here, it was all amazing.  Cute, trendy/rustic decor, and the food is outstanding.  The mole was so smokey and rich and flavorful and the Mayan cochinita pibil taco was so tangy and tender.  Seriously, I ate until I literally could eat no more.  America's used to be my go-to for cheap tacos a la carte, but this place has edged firmly into first place."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about this place.  I found it on Yelp as we were on our way home from the airport.  I am vegetarian, and good Mexican vegetarian food is hard to find.  I must say this place is a treasure.  I had the potato/nopalito taco and a black bean taco with mango salsa.  Both of them were the best I have ever had.  I would definitely go here again.  There is an amazing salsa bar with all kinds of delicious salsas.  Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"The best tacos in Phoenix! This place is fast, consistent, clean, and they have beer and a huge fresh salsa selection!"}
{"text":"Just ate lunch here after the Home and Garden Show....great place! The food is fresh and delicious and the salsa bar was delightful! My husband's margarita came with slices of fresh fruit which added a yummy dimension. The decor is pleasing to the eye. The place is small, but the wait was short. Even though we live in the East Valley, we will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This place was an incredible find. We trusted Yelp on this one and it did not disappoint! The only knock (and it was no surprise if you read the reviews) was that it was pretty small so they run a pretty small crew.  With the 15 or so different salsas at the homemade salsa bar and the late amount of food we got, we were not in any hurry to leave!

We will definitely be back here soon!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious - we ordered the shrimp tacos and a beef burrito- and very reasonably priced! Comfortable atmosphere, polite servers, and amazing horchata!"}
{"text":"I had a whole hearty meal. It wasn't heavy which I loved. It was nothing out of the ordinary but I did like the quality of the ingredients used. I probably wouldn't attend again. 
The customer service was not that great and our drinks were never refilled.
The 3 star is pretty generous of me."}
{"text":"Loved the salsa bar with all kinds of fresh and unique salsas! Pecan, Jicama, Peanut, and Radish to name a few and I'm not usually a fan of tomatillo but it was really good. I had the steak and the black chicken mole tacos- the steak was on the dry side and lacked flavor but the salsa helped kick it up the few notches to where it needed to be. The space is small and tight, but with a cool modern Mexican decor. It looks like there is room to expand which I hope they get around to soon. We went for lunch and it was crowded and cramped. Service was good and attentive."}
{"text":"After seeing the great reviews on Check Please and DDD, I was excited to give this place a try but after our recent visit, my family and I will never come back to this restaurant. 

1. The sign stated wait to be seated. We patiently waited about 10 minutes before a woman finally came up to us with a menu and told us to go cash register to place our order. 

2. The tacos were nothing special and far from \"gourmet.\" The salsa bar, however, had a wide variety of salsas, but not one was memorable.  The tacos were overpriced for what you get and there are definitely better tacos in the area and much less expensive. The rice was good so if you prefer rice over tacos, then this place is for you.

3. Lastly, the ladies room was filthy and visible from the main dining room. Not that we could see the door to the restroom while we ate but the door remained opened with the toilet clearly visible to my and other tables. Gross, yes but to make matters even worst, it appeared as if the restroom hadn't been cleaned in several days. 

Very disappointed!  I truly hope this was a one off experience, however, I don't think I have it in me to try again after such a lackluster and frustrating experience."}
{"text":"We get here get greated 5 stars 
We sit down they bring us chips 5 stars 
They ask us if we are ready to order we say yes I'm about to ask for a torta and the waiter tells me nope don't order than they aren't that good if you want tortas you should go to a torta shop. My reaction 0_O really grade 1 star.
We finish our chips server just looks at us doesn't bring us chips I get up give him the basket to see if he can bring us more he says yes grade 1 star.
He comes back I want to order some tacos he says no you should eat the quesadilla my reaction o_0 grade 1 star. 
We ask for napkins he responds \"oh they are in the hallway next to the restroom my reaction \"wtf\" I get up and grab them myself. Grade 1/2 star 
The deep fried quesadilla was so chewy I couldn't cut it \"this is what they are known for\" yeah.! They need another cook.! Grade 1star 
The meat was delicious.!!! 5 stars 
The salsas 5 stars 
The tacos were too big my advice keep them small and don't do double tortilla we get it you guys want us to leave satisfied but are doing a mistake serving your tacos with two huge tortillas.! We will not be going there anymore want so good tacos 7 ave and camelback next yo Charlie's \"tacos Yakis\" delicious tacos and not as pricy! Oh and why do you serve tacos with beans and rice wtf that's too American! Good night people.!"}
{"text":"My dad & I were in town for the day. We were sooo hungry & in the mood for anything so yelp helped me find this place & of course we were kind of iffy about it & expected it to be like every other Mexican restaurant, BUT we were totally mistaken! My dad is from Mexico City, but has been living in the US for almost 22 years. This is the FIRST place ever to actually have tacos that tasted just like from his hometown! He even teared up because of the memories that filled him (no i'm not exaggerating!), & when my dad says the tacos are authentic then they are! This place will be the only reason why we will come back to Phoenix! Hopefully this place lives on for good! :)"}
{"text":"Loved their Mole Burro. The sweetness of the mole mixed with a nutty spice flavor was the best. Our waiter was very prompt. Their salsa bar is worthy. At least 12 different types of salsa. So soooo good! Great place to eat for the price. Come here."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Phoenix, hands-down.  They have a great salsa bar, and delicious mole.  A great place to bring visitors from out of town."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food!!!! Love the salsa bar food is always fresh and amazing !! Have had everything on the menu and absolutely love it !!! Everyone in downtown Phoenix must try this place !!"}
{"text":"I had heard many good things about this place so I finally decided to eat there. The restaurant is small and cozy with lots of mexican art on the walls. On to the food... The salsa selection was very generous and I liked most of them. The beans were great and so was the rice. Now about the tacos, the mole was not that great, they went overboard on the chocolate imho, the carne asada was good. The chicken tinga taco changed my life, it was amazing! Overall it was a good experience. I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Unassuming spot for legit tacos. Salsa bar had a plethora of options, the couple that I tried were fresh and very good. I had never seen shark on a menu before - so I tried the shark, shrimp, and steak tacos with a side of rice - did not disappoint! Contrary to other reviews, I thoroughly enjoyed the rice. Next time I'm in the area, I will be back."}
{"text":"Great food but boy..... the wait to get served is so long. And forget getting your appetizer before your entree. We waited 30 min for appetizer only. 

If they continue with this horrible service I'm sure they'll go out of business, no matter if they were featured in Food network."}
{"text":"The very best tacos in town. The Aztec Tinga is fantastic...but the real star of the show is the Napoleon taco. 

Also fantastic are the quesadillas...and they will forever change the way you think about them. You'll never order a quesadilla from Taco Bell ever again. You've been warned. THESE quesas are puff pastries filled with gorgeous things, and then topped with Mexican sour cream. 

Also check out their salsa bar. Too many to choose from; and there are no wrong choices to make.

Run to La Condesa. Run past every other mediocre Mexican restaurant to get here because THIS place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Nice place decor. Presentation is nice and ordering process is different. 

You grab a menu take a set if you need a moment like I did as a first timer and when your ready you order at the counter and pay which is good to get it done and not have to wait for your bill when your finished eating. 

The girl next to me had a quesadilla and looked good so I decided to try it. It's called la quencha and food presentation was nice topped with cotija cheese, red onions and avocado and green sauce but I did not expect the tortilla to be as thick as it was. It reminded me of a quesadilla chimichanga. I was full fast and the flavor was ok. I think for me next time I will try one of the specialty tacos. 

They have a nice salsa bar with a variety selection . 

Overall it was a nice experience and a nice first try"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with this place. Some friends and I sat at the bar tonight and were there for 15 minutes with no acknowledgment what so ever. No menus. They didn't bus the bar for us. We were passed by several times with no eye contact. I've been here before and the food is great but the service is terrible. We had to walk out 15-20 minutes after sitting down. Sad because I really love the food here but this makes us not want to come back"}
{"text":"Great food. 
Only negative is the seating space. Very little, and what exists is very cramped, particularly the seating adjacent to the fixings bar area.
Get theire early for lunch or wait until after the lunch crowd has come and gone."}
{"text":"Tacos are yum! Went a couple of times and ordered between shark, beer battered shrimp and white fish. Each bite... never disappointed. My daughter ordered the a pork burro that had pinnapple.... wow! Service is slow at times but the food and drinks more than make up for it. Definitely would visit again and wait longer if needed."}
{"text":"Almost missed this place, because Yelp still shows no alcohol, and a mexican meal without a beer or margarita is not complete.  Glad I went!  We split the shrimp, veggie and pork tacos.  This is the only place where I would consider ordering a veggie taco over the meat ones.  The grilled vegetables were packed with flavor, and the cheese was perfect.  Add an awesome salsa bar and mexican beer, and you have the perfect meal for before or after the ball game.  I would have given 5 stars, but the pork tacos didn't wow me.  Don't get me wrong, they were good - but just above average."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for the first time and we tried this place for lunch - from the outside we weren't so sure about heading in but boy are we glad we did!! 

The decor inside is very cool - when we sat down they brought out fresh tortilla chips and we went up to their salsa bar and tried our way through at least 6 salsas leaving many more we didn't even get to try!  My hubby got 4 different tacos to try and couldn't pick a fave he liked them all so much!  I got the veggie quesa, a twist on quesadilla made with a crispy corn shell - it was delicious yet huge I couldn't even get through half!  

I'd highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It can sometimes be difficult to find solid mexican food, but this place nails it, bringing dishes from various regions in mexico, but mostly central and southern. 
The salsa bar is fun, it is great to find a dish you like and experiment with new salsas.
The negative of the place is also its charm, but it is small and usually very busy, so expect a 10-15 minute wait. 
My favorites are the burritos, with a grapefruit margarita."}
{"text":"Salsa bar alone is worth it.  Awesome artwork is worth it.  Best tacos/burritos are the cactus ones.  Not overpriced.  We love this place."}
{"text":"I love this taco shop.  They offer a wide variety of tacos and they are all good.  My favorite are actually the vegetarian tacos.  They come spilling over with grilled veggies and cheese.  They are amazing.  The salsa bar offers a huge variety of different salsa including unique salsas made from fruit (strawberry) and nuts (pecan).  I took away a star because the seating is super tight and it is hard to move around in there.  The seats themselves are really uncomfortable (heavy wooden chairs).  I agree with a previous reviewers that I can do without their rice and beans.  But the tacos are so filling, you will not need them."}
{"text":"Killer tacos and the salsa bar is unparalleled. Get there early, nut if your late it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wow.  Mind, stomach and taste buds blown.  Mexican is my favorite cuisine and hands down La Santisima is the best Mexican food and carne asada I've ever had.  I'm still craving it -- it's that good!  

I'm a Southern California native and am blessed with great Mexican food, but La Santisima is a different category.  They serve Tex-Mex and their quesas (their version of a quesadilla) -- straight foodgasm in my mouth.  I just wish we had more time in Az this time around to go back and try their fish tacos.  (Yes, it was that good that I would've gone back consecutive days!)

So many salas to choose from, all were spicy but delicious and peanut was my favorite.  Thanks for upping the bar and you've made the quesa my last wish meal.  Can't wait to be back --- or open up in Cali, haha."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time for lunch and got the 3 street tacos Al Pastor and a large Horchata. The Horchata wasn't your typical kind... It had pieces of walnut and other stuff. So damn good!! It was really good. There's also a lot of different styles of salsa to try.  The 4 different salsas I tried were all tasty spicy and deliciously good. They had about 12 different salsas to try. Service was on point! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"If I lived in Phx I would eat here every day. I am vegan, my boyfriend is not. We both agreed the food is the best Mexican fare we have ever had. My mouth is watering just remembering our meal."}
{"text":"Really good tacos. The Cabo Shrimp tacos are excellent and very authentic. They are sooo similar to the tacos we loved in Cabo! 

I'd highly recommend this place for great food cheap."}
{"text":"Found this little gem from Yelp reviews and it was AMAZING!! The food was outstanding! The salsa bar was unreal with so many choices and so delicious. We went 2 times in the same 4 day trip because it was so good. When you pull up it's not the nicest area of town and it seems a little sketchy at first but don't let appearances fool you, the food is OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"Chicken Mole tacos are so delicious. Great art, not too busy on Saturday evening, small place... Every good Mexican place has great salsa and beans...and they bring you chips...they are doin it right."}
{"text":"Chips were stale. Service was slow and in frequent. I got the 3 street taco entree. Cochinita Pibil, Al Pastor and Carne Asada were 3 out of 5. Beans weren't hot."}
{"text":"I have had the great pleasure of working with Suzy and Bruce at Inter Valley Escrow. As a lender that has worked with countless escrow companies I can say with absolute certainty this is one of the best you will ever find. It is because of Suzy and Bruce. They go WAY above and beyond what is expected to make a deal come together. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants an escrow company that is fast, courteous, and willing to go the extra mile!"}
{"text":"The salsa bar IS the best in phoenix. Just tried the Napoleon taco made with filet mignon: loved the sauce with mushrooms and crunchy onions, as good as what you would find in a fine dining restaurant. This will be my new favorite along with the cabo shrimp taco: big fresh and juicy shrimp fried to perfection! I also love their quesadillas...not like anything you would get anywhere else."}
{"text":"Delicious food and reasonable price. I like Mexican food so much, La Santisima 
is great Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Pass! No kids menu. Expensive and very different from the typical Mexican restaurant. 

Although the margarita was great, the food was not. We asked for a burrito for each of the kids containing just chicken and cheese, and they charged us $25 for the two of them. My husband and I ordered a chicken burrito that was so-so, for $10 each. 

I would have been fine with the prices if the food was good but it wasn't. The chicken was almost all rubbery dark meat. 

The salsa bar was fun but the chips were stale. The service was okay but I couldn't believe they charged us more for two burritos that contained less ingredients for the kids."}
{"text":"Oh the mole!!!!  It is a treat to come here and have such amazing flavors, salsas and variety."}
{"text":"Love this spot, I drive from Chandler all the way to Glendale to enjoy this restaurant 

Cochinita pibil tacos very flavorful 
Tried the chicharron quesa was awesome 
Definitely recommend this place 
Small little restaurant with a whole lot of flavor
The Horchata drink is delicious, my favorite by far, it's like no other!!"}
{"text":"Tip: When it says 3.99 a la carte, it's actually only 1 taco. Only the taco plate has 2 tacos. We made that mistake and our bill ended up tripling in price. 

On a brighter note, the horchata was fantastic! This is the first time I've seen horchata filled with so much fruit and it was such a large size, perfect for sharing. We ordered the slow cooked pork taco and I thought it was a little too messy. I enjoyed the fish tacos the most, light and crispy.

Also loved the extensive salsa bar and the fact there is cilantro salsa!"}
{"text":"This place has a very unique atmosphere. My family owns the oldest Mexi restaurant in Scottsdale so I know a few things about Mexican food. First off, the food was awesome however the waiter was not very helpful for first- timers. Second of all, he snuck guacamole into our order. My dinner partner was upset they weren't up front about that. She is less experienced and thought the guac came with the chips. Shame on you for that. Be more upfront and helpful to new patrons. Probably will not be back but thanks for the amazing tacos!"}
{"text":"BOMB! LIFE CHANGING! DELICIOUS! A lot of my visits to restaurants happen just by chance. I googled, \"Restaurants near me\" as my husband and I were driving up 7th St. This came up and I thought the name was interesting so we decided to give it a try. MAN! This was a good pick! 
The food was so delicious and freshly made. They had a salsa bar with many different salsas. All were delicious and none too spicy. I should knock it off a star because the service was not great (they were slow, but it was because they are busy)  but I can't because their food was that great. I got the 3 taco combo with rice and beans (1 taco barbacoa and 2 shrimp), my son a traditional quesadilla, and my husband the Mazatlan burrito with shrimp. All of it was amazing! The beans were not out of a can, the rice was do tasty and...man! Honestly, greatness! 
We are from out of state and I joked with my husband about coming back before heading back home, but honestly, I was not joking. I would definitely go there again, and again, and again, whenever I see my way back to AZ."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but probably not \"gourmet\". The entrees and salsas won't disappoint, and there are great choices for everyone. In all honesty though, La Santisima is just a cut below the Taco Guild or Barrio Café. It is not that they are doing anything wrong - the other places are just a little bit better.

The food is inexpensive, the drinks are good, and you won't leave without a smile on your face."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on Diners, Drive ins and Dives and realized it was down the street from my work. The salsa bar is off the charts. Didn't even realize there were so many types of salsa. The ones I tried were delicious!! Restaurant is quaint but adds to the feels. Art work on the walls is super cool and also adds to feel of the authenticity. Highly recommend!! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Extremely poor service! The location on N16th street in Phoenix is better in terms of service. Food tastes the same."}
{"text":"Best quesadilla I have ever had and hands down best margarita! Staff was super friendly. Will come back if ever in Phoenix again"}
{"text":"What a great, quaint place!  The salsa bar is amazing!  We have not been disappointed anytime that we have visited.  The food is always delicious.   The seating is limited, so I would avoid the prime meal times."}
{"text":"Great food, very slow service.  I can't imagine what it would be like if they were busy."}
{"text":"Holy hell, their Arab-style burrito (a tahini sauce, al pastor, etc., in a burrito) is the best burrito I've ever had. I got a few of the cochinita pibil tacos as well based on another yelper's comments, and those we indeed excellent, but the burrito for me was the real standout. The pairing of tahini and smoked pepper sauce is a total winner, and is very interesting given the history of middle eastern food in Mexico. 

Also, don't skip the horchata. It has strawberries and nuts, and is devoid of the chalky horchata mix that many places had. Best horchata I've ever had - and like burritos - I've had my share. 

My only complaint was the chocolate mole taco - it was far too sweet for my taste, and had too much mole on it and ended up being overpowering. However, if you love super chocolately moles, you'll probably like!"}
{"text":"This place is so small and always packed. The first time we tried to go they only accepted cash. The second time it was so packed that we couldn't even get out of our seats to check out the salsa bar. Food was delicious but the place was uncomfortable and too overcrowded to enjoy."}
{"text":"The black mole chicken taco's are the best I've had in Phoenix.  I've eaten black mole from Mexico City to the Yucatan, and these will rival any of them; except for our Aunt's in Mexico City."}
{"text":"Awesome food, good service and a super salsa bar.  The place was little small but nonetheless it was great!.."}
{"text":"We'll as a taco shop it's ok it's a self serve salsa bar and get your own fork kinda
Place not overly impressed with the food beans runny rice was
Good tacos ok  prices are fair Service was good need some help on there tables they all are wobbly tried several lol give it a try."}
{"text":"I lived on the U.S.-Mexico border for a good portion of my life. Everybody claims to sell \"street tacos\" in the Southwest, especially AZ. After TWO years of looking for decent Norten~o Mexican food in the Phoenix area, I found La Santisima (formerly La Condesa). They have a wide range of salsas and condiments to add to your food. So check it out and try it. The salsa has heat and flavor that is lacking in 99% of \"Mexican food\" places around here. Be advised that it's a small place that specializes in tacos and burros and, at times, there's not enough room to sit. However, it's really worth the wait. I drive all the way from northeast Mesa/AJ to just have some of their fare. As far as the latter not so favorable review (9/6/2015) on here questioning authenticity, I don't understand how something isn't \"authentic,\" when northern Mexicans regularly use mayo and mustard, due to U.S. influence. Ever had a Sonoran hot dog? The menu does state that the owners are from the northern state of Sonora. Regardless of these types of reviews, La Santisima is a great place to go have some beer and tacos in a dark place reminiscent of a taqueria on the Mexican side of the border. Besides, where else can you see posters of \"El Santo\" movies in the men's restroom? If you've been watching \"The Strain\" on FX, this is the movie hero upon which the \"Silver Angel\" character is based. Without a doubt, wholeheartedly recommend this place for tacos and beer... btw, if you're looking for margaritas, the ones we had were far from \"watery.\""}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is the fact that you have more than the usual carne asada, al pastor, and (insert third typical meat), instead you have a variety of different tacos, some which I've never heard of but all very delicious. Alongside this, you also have many salsas to choose from, ranging from not so spicy to spicy. I definitely plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, lots of variety to choose from! They also have a salsa bar with a ton of different salsas to pick from. We got a glass of Sangria and it was huge but delicious. It's a small hole in the wall type place, kinda sketchy area. Parking available in the back. Would def recommend this place to anyone. Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, since it was named La Contesa.  I've also referred numerous business clients and friends.  Never again!  Not only has the service gone downhill, the prices are outrageous.  The one server brought us stale chips, unsalted.  There were at least 4 bussers working the place, but only one server???  Very odd for a 5pm dinner rush.   The guacamole and cilantro salsa taste as though it had spoiled.  Ordered queso fundido with mushrooms, a chicken taco plate, and a chicken burrito with enchilada sauce.  Never got the queso - no big deal I guess, somewhat expected when you have only one server and it's busy.  Rice was cold for both entrees.  The kicker was the final bill.  They now charge you for meat on your tacos and burritos.  It cost $20 for a chicken burrito with a side of cold rice, no beans!!!  The menu says extra charge for shrimp or mahi mahi tacos (2.95 to be exact), but nothing about a chicken charge for tacos.  They charged me $2.97 chicken on the tacos!  All in all, based on the quality of the food, the horrible service, the prices, the weird smell, and the stagnant air (A/C wasn't working in the first dining room), we won't be coming back.  Very sad, as this was one of our favorite restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Fabulous and unique burritos.   No wonder we stand in line to order."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food. Their margaritas are also amazing. Be prepared to wait, however it's well worth the time."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were amazing..I enjoyed the black mole` taco.  The salsa bar had a variety of flavors and spices...The guacamole was rediculously hot, but yummy!  The service was a little rough, it was very busy and i think they were understaffed.  They forgot to set our table and once served did not come around often to check on us.  If you dont mind waiting and sub par service come check this place out...The good food definitely outweighs the bad service."}
{"text":"this place was ok not as good as people make it seem one thing I like is salsa bar. dislike the location."}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten at this place, you're missing out! The tacos are some of the best in the valley. Not much seating and fills up fast, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I went by myself on a Saturday evening. I got there around 6pm and the place was pretty much totally packed, with a wait. However, they have a very tiny bar with a few chairs, so I was able to grab a spot there.

Parking was a bit stressful. There are only a small handful of spots in front of the building. The nearby neighborhood does allow free parking but some of the locals seem to have put up their own \"no parking\" spots in front of their house, so the neighborhood seems a little less than friendly.

The menu itself features a wide array of tacos, including some great fish options (I had a shark taco which was quite good). They also have some typical street tacos such as carne asada. The highlight may actually be their salsa bar, which features over a dozen unique different salsa flavors (there are some typical flavor and then some strange ones like peanut, cilantro, etc.). But beware, almost all of them are pretty spicy! The chips are pretty standard, but having such a wide array of salsa choices (and the ability to just go get them yourself whenever you want) really makes it a great experience.

My favorite part of the meal may have actually been the horchata. I have had tons of horchata in my life, but La Santisima features a very unique combination that includes real chopped fruit. It was very refreshing, and the portion size is a huge 32 oz.

All in all, this was a great meal. It is definitely worth trying to find a parking spot (and waiting for a table)!"}
{"text":"We tried this place due to yelp.   We were impressed with the atmosphere as it has beautiful art hangings and the place is clean.  I ordered the guacho burrito and the horchata due to the yelpster's recommendations. I usually don't go for beef so I wasn't crazy about the burrito, but it was good.   I was freaking crazy about the Horchata though!  I am a salsa snob so it takes a lot to impress me.   Rule number one - it must cause burn or don't call it salsa.   The seven chiles was so good that there wasn't much left at the salsa bar.   What was left, I took!  Second best salsa was the salsa peanut!  It was creamy, hot, flavorful and the best salsa peanut I have ever had!  So happy that they serve real salsas. My only recommendation for them would be to improve on the chips.   The chips are a bit thin, but cover them with salsa and all will be alright. When in Phoenix-go to this place.   It's a bit small, but hang in there and grab a seat and set your tongue on fire then cool it down with the horchata!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Huge salsa bar with so many options. Will definitely be back many times!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Think I have sampled a bit of everything. Tried three different kind of tacos (chicken, beef, and fish), a burro (carne asada), and a quesadilla (ground beef). Everything was really good. 

The quesadilla is quite a bit different then other quesadillas I have had. Much thicker. More like a stuffed gordita. Was really good.

Small place. No wait was I was there, but I can easily see there being one. Salsa bar is fantastic."}
{"text":"Holy cow, this place is great and very accommodating for vegetarians and vegans. The poblano quesadilla was incredible. Be sure to hit up the salsa bar and order some horchata, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This food is phenomenal...best salsa bar, tacos and burritos! El gaucho and the santisima special are the best!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and I'm so glad I did... This is the best Mexican food hands down in all of AZ! From the family recipe for horchata to all the different types of tacos you can see that they pride themselves with only using quality products! Cant wait to go again."}
{"text":"They have 3 items: tacos, corn quesa, and burritos.  They are all first rate!  They also have the best salsa bar with really creative salsas.  We've been here many times, tried almost the entire menu, and the food is always delicious.  The horchata and jamaica drinks are also a must!  Our only complaint is the noise level.  It's a small venue and they play the music loud enough that it interferes with having a conversation."}
{"text":"The asada meat smelled bad and tasted worse when we informed about it, not even an apology and they still charged us for the street taco. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourites Phoenix restaurants. The food is delicious and very authentic."}
{"text":"This place has been a tradition of sorts when I'm in town for work but unfortunately I contracted a nasty bout of food poisoning after eating there this past Monday night. I can't say with 100% certainty that it was the Guacho Burro but the only other thing I had eaten that day was a frozen breakfast sandwich and a coffee. Never again. Shame, I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Mexican food in the valley! This is the first place I saw the use of cactus in Tacos and it was yum! I am so glad that they have good vegetarian/vegan options. 
They have a kickass salsa bar as well. My favorite one was salsa mexicana. 
The food was so good that I forgot to take pictures. Sorry, hehe!"}
{"text":"LOVE the food here and the atmosphere is quaint and authentic with great artwork.  Plan on being there a while- I think they have such an eclectic menu preparation time is long (no matter which location you go to).  The food and margaritas are well worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Shrimp Tacos are out of this world!!! So fresh and tasty. The horchata is great also!"}
{"text":"There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about the GEM of joint... without a doubt my go-to for great Mexican food!!!  Small and quaint with an awesome salsa bar and delish food!"}
{"text":"Greatest happy hour ever!  Cheap beer and street tacos.  We did not get any of the specialty ones but it did not matter, everything was fresh and amazing.  They have the best mole in the Pheonix, we searched multiple spots and this one is special.  Salsa bar is crazy!  I am taking my family here when they arrive!"}
{"text":"This place was good!  I ordered 4 tacos to-go: dogfish shark taco, carne asada taco, cochinita pibil taco, and the chicken mole taco.

The shark taco was outstanding, it was not too greasy and topped with cabbage and crema.  The carne asada was some of the best I have had.  It was juicy and seasoned perfectly.  The chicken mole had great flavor and was very rich.  I wasn't too crazy about the cochinita pibil but that is most likely just a matter of taste, nothing was wrong with it.

The salsa bar is very overwhelming with close to one million different selections.  

By the way, parking is a nightmare."}
{"text":"Fantastic. I had gaucho borro, was delicious but I should have added rice and beans. Margaritas were tasty too. Guacamole was from perfectly ripe avocados, which I really appreciated.

If you go at night, don't be discouraged by the total lack of lighting outside. Inside the food was great and staff was welcoming."}
{"text":"This place is simply the best. This is my favorite Mexican food in Phoenix. I have sent MANY people here and every single person has been amazed. I moved to Seattle and boy do I miss this place. The service, atmosphere, and most importantly the food is GREAT. It is all fresh and I don't know who is back there making this heavenly food but they definitely know what they are doing! 

The salsa bar is huge and all of them are amazing. I can't wait to visit Phoenix so I can go again. They used to be call La Condessa.. not sure why the changed their name but who cares as long as they still have those amazing tacos, amazing burritos and that amazing salsa bar.  

Side note: I am a vegetarian and have had no problem with the selection of vegetarian food. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered a steak burrito and really liked it. The quality of the ingredients were very good. The salsa bar has a large variety of different salsa's. I am docking two stars for service. I asked the cashier for a couple extra lids for salsa and she said that \"it's three per order\".  I told her I needed more salsa and if I had to pay so be it.  I really hate when places do that. That kind of thing makes me not want to go back.  Then after that incident, I had ordered to go and while I was waiting this man kept calling the to go order for  \"ranchero burrito\" and I didn't pick it up because I ordered a steak burrito. A few minutes later he asked me what I ordered and when I told him, he said \"that's the order I've been calling!\" How am I supposed to know my order was called a ranchero burrito when the menu doesn't even call it that?!  
Service is important to me when I go out to eat, as good as the food was, I probably won't be returning for this reason."}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin for some HH.

We in total had 4 margs ($3 on happy hour, can't beat that). And they were actually really good!

We both also had the Al Pastor burro which was good portioned and delicious.

Our server was friendly, however, the petite lady with dark hair when we entered was NOT. Dunno what her problem was. We \"may\" be back, but hopefully not when she's there. We got such a snotty vibe- and its not a good look. Maybe cause we're cute girls & she's a hater?

When we walked in, no one presented themselves as a hostess so I ask snotty do we seat ourselves? NO response. Ignored. Lol! Ok, so we just sat ourselves. 

I agree with other reviews, that we just sat there with no water, a basket of chips, and no service for like 10-12 minutes with workers wondering around knowing that we were sitting there. We had never been here before, so we didn't know about getting our own salsas until we were sitting for 10 mins and finally were able to ask. Even a \"thank you!\" on our part to snotty woman was ignored.. Ok lol. Just cause foods good doesn't mean you should lack in service.... And your SERVICE is what I will be telling people about if they ask about your restaurant."}
{"text":"since I cannot show my face in Gallo Blanco ever again, this has now become my fave gourmex establishment where they will trade food for $!

the tacos are good. the salsa is better. the only downfall, is NO ALCOHOL! ...which may be why I am still able to show my face in here...and perhaps why the hairspray is not sticky... NO ALCOHOL!"}
{"text":"I had a groupon to this lovely place and since then I've visited this place TWICE! I absolutely love the horchata and have definitely not tasted anything better."}
{"text":"Great place, if you're looking for excellent unique Mexican food rather than the plain old run of the mill rice and beans being served every half mile in Phoenix. My wife and I love new and unique, we had one look at their salsa bar (all made from scratch) and had to try them all. The tortillas alone are fantastic, but then filled with shredded chicken, mole, shrimp, roasted peppers, fried cheese, cochinita, all blended with traditional spices and cook to delicious Mexican perfection and add to that the accompaniment of ALL THOSE SALSAS! The decor is beautiful, it has a very rustic cantina feel to it, with some amazing artwork on the walls. Over all the only disappointing thing is that we didn't discover this place sooner."}
{"text":"La Santisima could hold its own in any city. In Glendale, this place is a shining beacon of food  goodness. It's a temple of deliciousness in a culinary scene of soggy white bread. The guy recommended the tacos. They were all tasty, and the burnt cheese on top really sealed the deal. Yum! Definitely worth a return trip. 
As a bonus, it's next to a drive through liquor store, which seems like it should not be entirely legal."}
{"text":"Posted Sunday, December 15, 2013, but was deleted....

Rice and beans, just like Nana's house. Over 15+ tacos you can choose from. Each has its own flavor and distinction. Atmosphere is basic and modern. Paintings hang on walls. The simplicity of the restaurant is only supported by the flavorful tacos. This is a must to go spot in downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"We went based on Yelp reviews and are very happy for it.  The restaurant has an authentic feel to it and some interesting wall art.  Not a single sombrero in sight.  We both had the tacos,  which are amazing. I recommend you get 2, unless you are really hungry.  The guacamole we had was also very good.  All the staff were friendly and helpful.  We recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim after passing by. Super happy we did. My husband had Carne Asada tacos , I had the Pastor they were amazing! My husband is supppppper picky about Mole. I make him try it everywhere we go for the past 14 years . Never found a good one till now! Amazing!!! But the most incredible thing for me was the Horchata holy good lord I loved it. I will be stopping by just to get that on my way home from work on many occasions. The waiters were a bit shy but very attentive without being annoying. I will defiantly be bringing everyone I know here!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to some great Mexican food in Arizona. The stellar yelp reviews and visit by Guy Fieri made me think that this was just the place. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.

The restaurant is incredibly small. You have to try to snag a table, which makes lingering not an option. Plus, it makes it feel a little bit like people are watching you eat.

I ordered the Tinga Chicken Burrito. I was disappointed to find the chicken to be all dark and lacking flavor. The burrito had no cheese or spice. It was an okay burrito, but it was heavy and certainly not one I would crave.

Overall, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Yeah, so, everything everyone else is saying about this place is true.  Marvelous tacos, great salsa, cozy and cool.  I had the tacos with chimichurri and pabil (sp?).  I would have ordered more but I had to run back to the hotel for a work meeting."}
{"text":"I died and went to taco heaven! This place elevates tacos to another level. The meats (I had pork, mani and steak), were seasoned and cooked to perfection. The chips are the real deal and compliment the amazing selection of salsas at the salsa bar! Decor is welcoming and has beautiful art. Service is friendly and prompt. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Not sure if I agree about them having the best salsa in PHX but everything was pretty good and there were many salas to chose from. If your in the area I would definitely recommend it but, not really worth a long drive."}
{"text":"Yum !! The Mayan burritos are amazing ! Slow roasted seasoned pork in a delicious flour tortilla. So good. I ordered them to go so I don't have an opinion on the service this time. Go get one !!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service
The restaurant is always clean and presentable. The owners are very warm and welcoming. Lots of different salsas to choose from. Fantastic horchata (probably the best i've ever had) 
Tacos are amazing!!"}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST TACOS IN PHOENIX. 
They have ruined any other taco shop for me. 
Dont think abt it twice and go."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Went on a Saturday night about 6 and had about a 5 min wait. Right away got chips and water so we could try out the abundant salsa bar! Nice fresh Margherita while we waited for our steak, chicken and chicken mole tacos which were amazing!  Son had a steak quesa Dillard and hubs had steak burrito ALL AMAZING! Nice, fast service! Food was a bit more of a wait than normal but so worth it since it all tasted so fresh! Definitely a \"come again\" spot!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent; great flavor (Aztec tinga chicken taco, Tlaloc cactus taco, La Sanitsima specialties taco with chicken). The salsa bar was great. The ambiance was fun. The waitstaff were friendly and helpful. The chairs scraping on the floor were annoying. The pink mold in the water container was vomitus. 

I would give the food 4.5-5 stars. Because of the water issue I am bumping it down. That is just gross. 

If you are gluten free, be careful: they use soy sauce in their cactus tacos. (Our waitress was apologetic and made me something else.)

All-in-all, we would come back and just order something bottled and skip the water."}
{"text":"Tacos were amazing.  Period. Very tasty and flavorful. The refried beans were house made and delicious. This review is not for the drinks. My margarita was ok. And for the price of $8 it was meh. Next time I'll have a $5 Mexican beer and I'll know what I'm getting. The Service was great and they made the most of the small space and were flipping tables as fast as they could. The salsa bar had an array of about 15 flavors ranging from super spicy to very mild. I'll be back for more tacos soon."}
{"text":"This place is so badly managed it's almost unbelievable.

The dining room has literally, 36 lights.. 34 of which are burnt out and have never been replaced.. 
it's a simple matter of replacing GU 10 bulbs,  it's not trying to find the location of the Ark of the covenant.

Instead they opted for a clip on style flood light ..with extension cords running through peoples table .. when they turn the flood light on the blinding beam felt like we'd been spotted by border patrol crossing the US Mexican border at night. 

Also here's a tip ...if you run out of guacamole every single day maybe you should make more guacamole in the beginning..just a thought..

That being said the tacos are tremendous!"}
{"text":"The variety of salsas is pretty damn good. They will have everything from the most unoffensively bland salsa for gueros to a chile de arbol salsa that could make my daddy sweat."}
{"text":"Visited on Thursday February 23rd at 6.30PM. It had been a while since our last visit and i noticed the restaurant had expanded. Great expansion because i did feel in the past that this restaurant was rather cramped. We arrived at the door noticing at least 5-6 empty tables and room at the bar. We were greeted by a young hostess who stated that she was not allowed to leave anyone in because the waitresses/waiters were too busy and she did not have enought menus for everyone. We asked if we could sit at the bar and drink water until they were ready. We did state that we drove 45 minutes to get here. She stated that it might be anywhere from 40 min to 1 hour wait. My frustration with this whole scenario was that there were plenty of tables open and we were not allowed to sit down. Why expand a restaurant if you cant staff it correctly and get enough menus for each seating space in the restaurant. I will never visit this restaurant again based on this experience."}
{"text":"I thought the food was really good. It was a little busy because it was lunchtime, but thats ok because that means the food was fresh."}
{"text":"Salsa bar was great.  Some of the salsas were extremely hot and kinda wish they would label the heat index somehow.  The tacos and horchata were fantastic.  Two young guys as the servers who were extremely friendly and helpful. I didn't realize the quesadillas were fried which I didn't like.  I am not sure if it is listed on the menu, but that really is a slight complaint.  

I would go again and just stick to the tacos"}
{"text":"I'd give it zero stars but that's not an option. The food was mediocre and lukewarm. Service was relatively slow. I have no idea how they have 1500 reviews and are graded at four and a half stars out of 5."}
{"text":"La Condesa, I give up on you. We try and try to excuse the terrible service, but no more. It's not worth it. It's too slow and inattentive and they just don't give a damn, so I'll take my $33 elsewhere.

This time we were disappointed by the food, too. We returned our horchata for being too thin and tasteless, and you brought us new ones after we finished eating. You drizzled a pretty crema all over the top of my torta (sorry, lonche). How do I pick it up and eat it? 

In the past we forgave the dirty tables and loudness because your cochinita pibil was pure bliss. But not even that makes up for the service. :("}
{"text":"I had to finally give La Condesa (recently changed their name to Santisma Tacos) the five stars they deserve. THIS PLACE IS MY JAM. We eat here all the time and believe me when I say that their santa condesa veggie taco is the best you'll ever have in your life (if you're vegetarian) and definitely awesome even if you're not a veggie. My go-to lunch/dinner is the 2 taco plate with one santa condesa and one ghandi vegan taco (their guacamole on this is divine). If you haven't ever had a horchata with fruit and nuts in it, it's about time. Theirs is delicious. 

They also have brunch (!!!!) and it's so fabulous. Just make sure to add Oaxaca cheese if it's not already part of the option, trust me."}
{"text":"Based off the salsa and margarita I'm in love. My food isn't even out yet and I'm a happy girl. Fresh quality taste. Service is great although my mom and I are the only people here. I will definitely be updating after I eat my quesadilla. Yummy yum"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix!  LOVE the protein-style tacos and yummy salsa bar.  I love condiments, so the salsa bar is a definite highlight for me.  Also, they recently expanded the restaurant so it is about double the size of what it used to be. I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Waited for 10 minutes at the bar without so much as a hello from the staff here. I understand being busy, but to not even be acknowledged while waiting is pretty rude. I didn't try the food because I tired of waiting and left. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Their tacos are fantastic!  Margaritas fantastic.  Seating could use some help. Crowded, Too many taters in the bag."}
{"text":"Thee best tacos and salsa bar in Phoenix, hands down. Service, not so much. I went about an hour before they closed one night, completely full house cleard out about 30 min before closing. With 30 min till closing they started cleaning up, turned off music and brought us the check. Kinda irritating to feel kicked out after I spent money at your establishment....but ill just have to go earlier I guess."}
{"text":"Outstanding wish I had this place in Utah the quesadillas are amazing, great selection of salsas"}
{"text":"they have 2 taco orders and i was stuck between two kinds so the waitress said, you can get one of each. perfect. i love problem solvers. the tinga and the cochinita are great. they come with picked purple onions. they pickle them with lime so it comes through strong, but i like lime."}
{"text":"Cravings during pregnancy is no joke. So when my pregnant self wanted some Horchata and Mexican food, yelp offered this restaurant as an option. I was half way out the door when I saw a picture of their Horchata. Although this establishment is almost 30 min away from where I live, I will go to great lengths to satisfy my cravings. 

The restaurant was small - fits like 25-30 people small. But it was cozy and vibrantly decorated in Dia de Los Muertos theme. My friend and I had a hard time figuring out whether we were to seat ourselves or if we were to wait for a host/hostess to seat us. There was no hostess stand and the staff looked to consist of about 4 people (all extremely busy). After much confusion and waiting time the man who we can only assume was the owner sat us (we walked up to the register to ask). 

The Horchata was excellent; and the food was even better. I will say my most favorite was the Pacific White Fish taco but the Black Mole Shrimp taco was just as delicious. My friend ordered the Maria Sabina Quesa which consisted of Oaxaca cheese and sautéed mushrooms deep fried in a corn quesadilla topped with Mexican sour cream and queso cotija. I am not used to eating a quesadilla this way but I don't think I can go back to the flat, boring quesadillas that I used to know. 

I love that this restaurant is authentic to Mexico and incorporates flavors from all regions of the country. I believe the reputation of the food is true to other yelpers' reviews however I have to comment on the under par service we received. I realized at one point that the service took a hit probably because the owner and sister/gf/wife (???) were noticeably feuding. I hope it was just an off day and am most definitely looking forward to my return."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Mexican I've ever had. Ate there in Feb 2014 and have been talking about the place ever since!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix manos down. Be patient with the service since it's soooo small but their food is the best. Their take on a quesadilla is delicious. Their salsa bar keeps my wife and I coming back time and time again. Just be careful not to get too full on chips before the meal comes out."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the margartia was the best one that I have ever had. The service however was poor. It took way to long to be addressed by the waitstaff. I believe it was because they did not have enough employees. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Delicious food, quaint atmosphere, and delicious food. Recently expanded to double the space, there may still be a wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch - it was packed but service was quick and we were able to share a table with another group. Taco selection is excellent. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I ordered the el pastor and carne asada tacos, and they were great. The wife got the shrimp tacos. They had great flavor, but the shrimp was a little small with a lot of batter. Unfortunately the batter became a little soggy and diminished the great plate. Overall, good food. The freshly made horchata was the most amazing drink I have had in years.....a must have every single visit. The dinning room area is really small, few seats which means it fills up fast. Service was mediocre, not a very personable experience."}
{"text":"Simple, best shrimp taco's! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Love their salsa bar and margaritas. The avocado salsa is my favorite. I don't eat meat, just seafood, so the menu is a little limited for me but I can always find something tasty."}
{"text":"Meh. This place came highly recommended, but it wasn't anything special. The food was okay and very overpriced for what you get. We ordered a three taco sampler plate,  and, while the presentation looked colorful and different, each taco tasted pretty much the same.  I will say, however, their guacamole is fantastic! With that said, it was $6 for a small bowl of it. Also, they have a nice selection of salsas at their salsa bar. 

I give it two stars for the lackluster food and also the environment. There were flies in the restaurant competing with my every bite, and the women's bathroom was horrible. Everything was broken!  The toilet paper dispenser, paper towel dispenser, door lock, and even the toilet seat.  

The restaurant was very busy for a Thursday afternoon at 2:00 so I may have hit them on an off day."}
{"text":"I've had my share of Margaritas and I must admit that these are the best in town. However, the new Glendale location needs to catch up on the quality of Margaritas as the ones they serve at their parent location (16th street and McDowell). I have faith that they will as they begin to settle down at their new location."}
{"text":"Though the food was decent, not amazing, the service was poor enough to not ever be back. I felt bad for the servers, there was 2 of them and they seemed overwhelmed. There was no sign of a manager or even a busser or greeter, so I think they just had way too much on their plate to give good service or even to smile. Like many of the other reviews the best thing about this place is the salsa bar, however most of the \"good\" salsas were empty and never refilled during our visit."}
{"text":"It worse than what I thought. La agua de horchata is way too much. Trying so hard to change it and add more to the original receipt it just makes it messy. Food wasn't good enough to recommend and the service was the worst. Dennys employees are way friendlier and way more professional. This place looks cool but the parking, service and food is not worth it."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon - went there today...  It was fantastic!  

I had the Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Taco plate. Loved it!  I normally don't order rice and beans but since It was my first time visiting here, I did get them.  The beans had a nice flavor and they were moist enough to dip my chips in and eat that way.  The rice had bits of corn and cilantro and was very flavorful.  

The salsa bar was also delicious with several options to choose from, including a strawberry salsa that was very nice for the sweltering Phoenix summer day.  

I liked La Condesa so much, I bought another Groupon while eating my lunch!  :)"}
{"text":"It says something when I've gone to this place 3 times in two weeks. It's a gem. The tacos are amazing. I love the fish tacos but the salsa bar is a huge plus. They have something for everyone and everything is delicious. Everyone I've taking there has enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"La Santisima Gourmet Taco Shop is my favorite place in Phoenix to get fish tacos and Mexican seafood.  The ingredients are really fresh, and everything tastes yummy.

Service can be a bit slow and seating is limited.  So, I recommend calling and placing to-go orders.  If you try to eat inside the restaurant during peak hours, prepare to wait 30 minutes.

I usually get the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Tacos, but I also like the 
Cabo Shrimp Tacos.

My boyfriend prefers beef, pork, and chicken dishes.  So, he usually gets the Sonoran Carne Asada Tacos or the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Tacos.  He also likes the Aztec Tinga Tacos."}
{"text":"Oh hells yes!  I had driven past this little gem several times and never really gave it much thought.  That is until a friend of mine invited me to join for a bite.

Some may say this place is small, but I say it's quaint.  The menu is pretty big, lots of veggie options:)  I ordered the veggie burrito (mushrooms, spinach, cheese, rice,  etc.) and my friend ordered a few different types of tacos.  I was excited to see how amazing the salsa bar was!  I opted for a creamy cilantro sauce.  It totally kicked up my burrito!!  I could order that burrito each time and use a different salsa and never get bored!  

The service was top notch and the prices were very reasonable.  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there and as for being a major taco fan i have had better(Los Angeles Tacos still rule) , but overall its pretty good compare to other places near by. I had the Argentine Style which thats were my dad is from.. was not as great the meat needed seasoning and the chimichuri was bland , not to mention a little cheap on putting the sauce on , so i had to ask for more. But the one that got me was the shark tacos , now thats a taco ! Just wish the would recomend the sauces/ salsa to put on it that would help bring out more flavor. They have so many salsas I WANTED TO TRY ALL OF THEM !  Great place for a good lunch and awsome concept ! if you have'nt tried it , you must go once its a fine meal for $10. Happy hour prices seem to be reasonable also. I will be back again i must say and will ask more questions about the sauces."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos we have ever had.  Had a great assortment of flavors, even vegetarian options.  Fast and friendly service. Loved all of the options to chose from."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Its small and always crowded when I come. Food takes longer than usual to come out but it's worth the wait. They have an awesome salsa bar but if you get there at the end of the night you might find it empty, which is disappointing. Don't come here if you're expecting street taco prices because they are far from that. Carne asada tacos are good but not worth it for me.

Anyways I go here for their AWESOME fish and shrimp tacos. They are pretty big and are delicious. Their food stays pretty consistent in taste. One of my favorites in town that I have found so far (my quest for good tacos never ends)."}
{"text":"Food here brings you back to old tradicional Mexico , the food is really implemented with lots of the tradicional spices of Mexican cuisine, there's great selection on the menu , the service is top notch , and definitely the taste of food is excellent, I will definitely put this place on my bookmarks of places to come back .... btw there's a salsa bar :)"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but I go two different tacos and they seemed so bare and tasted very similar and only had meat on it. The salsa bar was amazing. I'll probably try it one more time and skip the tacos."}
{"text":"Yes. Just yes. If you go, do the carne asada tacos. They were delicious and very decently priced. The beans tasted like homemade, honest to goodness refried beans. The salsas were all really interesting and the chips were nice and crunchy. I will definitely return!

Edit: went back a second time with my husband's family and even though there was 6 of us, we were treated very well by staff and I'm assuming owner. Great experience once again!!!"}
{"text":"This place delivers excellent gourmet tacos, delicious horchata, and Mexican bottled sodas. I can't wait to go back. It was so delicious and they had over 10+ tacos to choose from as well as other Mexican entrees. They don't have a kids menu, but the waitress helped find some tacos my kids would like. Definitely recommend and will return!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from an out of towner believe it or not & had it bookmarked for ages (like 12+ months). Then the hubs & I saw a DDD review & being a mole freak fan had to come & try the Chicken Mole Taco. Boy freakin' howdy. The best mole I've had well since EVER. I sincerely loved it. The hubs got the fish burrito with Mahi Mahi & it was divine. The tortilla & fish were super fresh. The molie I want to take a bath in & eat my way out. Just amazing. We tried a mango margarita we shared. It was sweet but not the usual margarita mix sticky sweet grossness by any means. We loved the salsa bar too. So many salsa choices & not 14 varieties of green & red traditional salsa. FYI a chip refill is $2.40 but worth it. Very creative delicious salsas. Loved the entire experience. The place is small so it is a bit cramped as it you feel like you're sitting at a few tables at once & the whole restaurant has only 2 servers on a busy Saturday night. They seat you, take your order, refill your drinks, deliver your food, bring your check, they are the cashier & bus their own tables as well. So it's not like you're waiting because they're flirting with a busser or on FB behind the drink stand. They are BUSY! So be patient & kind. The food is worth the slowness. Now run & enjoy the taco deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch yesterday. My daughter who works at a hospital nearby took us to this small restaurant with great quality food. Try several different sauces that are available to choose from a \"sauce bar\".  I highly recommend the quesadilla which is more like what I call a Mexican calzone. You may have to wait for a table, but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"soOO yummy!! 
the best vegetarian tacos around!! 
fantastic salsa bar too  & the Horchata soOO delicious! mmmm"}
{"text":"i have been to this place a few times now.. in the beginning it was amazing but last time i was a little disappointed.

the salsa bar has lots of great flavors, but the best was the guacamole which used to be free.  now they charge $3.75 for a tiny container..!

the quesa (although tasty) can be VERY greasy.. took it to go last time and it was literally swimming in the container by the time i got it home.

the art on the walls and bathroom doors is lovely and tricks me into liking the place more than i would otherwise, i think.

not bad.. but not good."}
{"text":"The art work is groovy.  The guacamole salsa has a nice sweet touch too it.  Delicious! Great atmosphere & nice people.  What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"I keep coming back because the I simply love their tacos. I'm pescatarian (seafood only, no other meat), but I've shared meals here with vegetarians  and my dining guests always say they plan to come back. I love the veggie taco and the vegan option, and usually pair one of them with either a shrimp or mahi mahi. Always delicious (and, of course, the salsa bar if great!)"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food, friendly and helpful staff, great vegan options. This place seems to get packed so plan ahead but I think it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Why can't I give this place zero stars?  This place was honestly horrible.  Our lyft driver recommended this place, because we were visiting Phoenix.  The service was slow & not friendly. The food came cold & was overpriced.  They don't even have tostadas?!...That was crazy to me."}
{"text":"Best carne asada tacos in Phoenix! I love that their tortillas are freshly cut and grilled. Everything is always delicious. However it is in a super sketchy part of town so you will get some unusual characters around."}
{"text":"If I can give negative stars I would. I have never been so disappointed in an establishment in my life. The food was alright. The service was horrible. Not enough parking. Had to ask multiple times for drink food boxes. Some we never got.  Would never set foot in this place again."}
{"text":"Great place, not fancy but good food and awesome drinks. Can't beat $3 margaritas during happy hour. Waiter was funny & friendly. I will bring friends to enjoy this place. Prices on food are decent."}
{"text":"The best Mexican gourmet restaurant in Phoenix. It used to be really small but they took over the party store near door so now its not crowded at all. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere with beautiful handmade Mexican paintings. The best part is their huge salsa bar. Extra orders of chips are not extra though by the way."}
{"text":"I understand that Saturdays are busy, and more bc I know the food is good but it is really disappointing and disheartening that I sit for 40 minutes and no one comes to take our order yet everyone that came after had already had theirs taken. Also waiting until the hour and our drinks weren't even at the table. The service needs 100% improvement. It would have been alleviated if someone at least came to acknowledge that we were patiently waiting instead of passing by. Or when they finally took our order an hour later, could you at least apologize for the wait??!"}
{"text":"If you LOVE Salsa then this is your place. Great Mexican food. Best hole in the wall ever.
16 different Salsas...so your going to find a few FAVORITES!!!!! Great place to go with friends. 
I am sure it will become a favorite meeting place."}
{"text":"Finally you got back over here first time was excellent tacos were very good especially the shrimp tacos I love them tempura batter on them this time try to roll a burrito and wasn't all that good 2 much I think still love their salsa bar a lot of choices and they're all delicious the service was not very good I don't really blame her they are having a employee meeting at 5 at night I would think that's a wrong time to have one especially when the place is filling up and no one's being helped  so I will be back but I'll get the shrimp tacos once again hopefully service will be better next time"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town. No doubt. Always on point, take out option makes always eating their tacos super easy. It gets pretty packed late nights and weekends. Still worth the wait. Always."}
{"text":"Strong margaritas... Fantastic good... Good service... Great vegetarian options... Veggie tacos were off the hook... Chips not so hot but this hole in the wall place has a lot going for it."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Phoenix and decided to try this place this evening due to all the yelper reviews. I was not disappointed. The salsa Bar had many different flavors of salsas-- yum!!! I was really pleased.  So many varieties and all complimented our meals very well. I got the al pastor bowl (perfect low carb option) and I was absolutely delicious! The kids had a chicken quesadilla and they were very happy. If I'm ever up this way I just may come here again. We had a wait for 30 minutes to get a table and we also had to wait 30 minutes for the food to come. It is fine except for little kids having to wait was not easy."}
{"text":"This location is on a dark corner bit excited to see the crowded restaurant. We had to wait (15 minutes for someone to clear the one  table that was not being used. The Bar tender was the waiter bus boy and he said \"we all do everthing"}
{"text":"Delicious street tacos. The salsa bar was great. So many different unique salsas. I would diffidently come back"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and so many choices. I had a al pastor street taco which is probably one of the best ones I've ever had. I also had the pacific white fish taco, two big pieces of fried fish, very crispy and tasty, and my friend and I shared the poblana quesa quesadilla, very untraditional but so good. You get chips when you sit down and theres a self serve salsa bar with a big variety of all kinds of salsas. Limited seating but we got a table right away. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome salsa bar. The Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco melts in your mouth. The horchata tastes like a liquid cinnamon bun."}
{"text":"This place is so unique. Everthing is a little different in a good way. I LOVE the pecan salsa! The tacos are great!!"}
{"text":"The first free basket of chips was a great way to sample their salsa bar. Portions were huge! I loved their rice with a few corn kernels ."}
{"text":"Specialty taco and margaritas are great. The Mayan taco is also good. Mole and Marlin were interesting but not as good."}
{"text":"Tacos were just OK. The wait was awful. The service was subpar. The restaurant doesn't seem to be able to keep up with the hype, in terms of service or quality. But I like the idea. Just wish it was executed better."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this place since it opened.  I'm not going to stop.  In fact I don't think I could stop if I wanted to- it's too good.  All the tacos are great (I especially like the La Condessa special taco with shrimp) and the El Gaucho burro and Bullet burrito are always a good choice. The place is clean and the staff are nice.  It's not always the fastest place to eat, but hey rushed eating isn't healthy!"}
{"text":"The tacos are $4 a pop (I guess that's why they call themselves a \"gourmet\" taco shop), but they're worth every cent. I came here twice and tried much of the taco menu. My favorites were: cabo shrimp, fish, mayan pibil, arrachera and guacho. This place has the best salsa bar I've found in Phoenix so far, too. Great house margarita as well!"}
{"text":"We have been here on three occasions so far, and I really like the food. The quesa poblano (Quesadilla with poblano chili's and oaxaca cheeese) is awesome.  I have only had the carne asada and al pastor street tacos, with beans and rice, and have no complaints.  Perhaps my favorite thing is the salsa bar, I am really partial to the Seven Chili's and the Salsa Mexicana, but there are so many great choices.

My only complaint is that on 2 of the three occasions we have been there, they have been understaffed on the front end.  Food comes out quickly, but not always the best service.  We never had our water refilled, and it took three requests to get a beer brought to the table.  Can't blame the server, they have been busy, but management may want to reconsider how they staff. 

Overall, this is becoming on of my favorite go-to spots for tacos.  If the service improves, I would bump it up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"The tacos are excellent and the salsa bar is fabulous.  Need to continue to go and the staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I've technically been to La Santisima twice, but have only eaten here once. I'm so disappointed because I live nearby and wanted this to become one of my regular spots.

Tonight the restaurant had a disappointing mix-up with me. I ordered pick-up from them using yelp. I waited 15 minutes then drove the 3 minutes it takes to get there from my house. The place was packed, and there were people waiting outside as well (on a Monday night at 8pm). I tried to get someone--anyone's--attention, to no avail. The staff do not seem friendly and will ignore you and try not to make eye contact with you, even when they are just standing there. I decided to ditch the crowd and wait in my car, refreshing my order status on the yelp app; even after 25 minutes they still hadn't confirmed my order. Soon I got a call from yelp concerned that they hadn't confirmed my order. 

I finally mustered the courage to go back in and push through the waiting area to speak with a staff member. They gave me a dirty look but I had to ask why they hadn't confirmed my order after such a long time. They quite nonchalantly explained to me that their yelp interface doesn't work. I told them I had prepaid and they said they couldn't do anything for me refund-wise; they didn't even think to ask if I wanted to re-order the meal I had pre-ordered via yelp. They were happy to take my money but not find out how to give me the food I had paid for. All the while, the staff member was more intent on doing something with the cashier computer than giving good customer service and talking to me. 

Previously, I have ordered the gandhi tacos. They were really rather pricey for some pretty basic ingredients and flavors. 

I hear this place has a great reputation; I am very frustrated by the terrible service offered. Also, if you know the yelp interface is broken, why not contact yelp to make sure no one pays for something that they inevitably will not receive? Thankfully, yelp is issuing me a refund (unfortunately I have to wait a couple days for processing). La Santisima did not own up to its mistake and made no apologies. Very unprofessional and very frustrating."}
{"text":"So I went to lunch here on a Friday and the place was full, but then again it isn't all that big. The interior is fairly nice for a Mexican food joint and what first caught my eye was the salsa bar. At least 10 different kind of salsas for the taking. This is a good omen. Gourmet Taco's feels incredibly insincere. It is like when MacDonald's have \"a la carte\" on the to of their back lit wall menu. It becomes a joke. 

I had the shrimp tacos that comes when ordering some cheesy slur that most surely contains the words 'baja' or 'cabo' or something silly to that nature. I also ordered the horchata to go with my lunch. The order is two decently filled tacos with both double corn tortillas. The shrimp wasn't the long monster that I expected but instead three minor in each taco. This was OK. Then it was filled with some kind of cabbagy mass that was completely raw and tasteless - but would look good on a  picture. This was not OK - tasteless filler is pointless. The horchata was tasty, but way too much ice in the glass. The salsa bar did not disappoint - they have hot and mild and spicy and seasonal, in this case some strawberry salsa that was strangely tangy. But I love the variety. 

I liked the food. Not all of our party did enjoy their meal, but I did. But it is too pricey for Mexican food.. because it isn't that spectacular at all. The price would be the discouragement for me, when it comes to my return factor. I have had better tacos for cheaper. that is the bottom line - but it wasn't bad. Not at all. 

In summary; meal was good but too expensive."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location yet and decided to try it out since the original place my boyfriend was trying to take me was closed. Still delicious! Staff was light and there wasn't very many people there but it took awhile for the food to come out."}
{"text":"The wide variety of tacos here are the perfect vehicle for the inventive salsas! Would recommend to people who like eating at good restaurants."}
{"text":"Veggie Burro + Salsa Sesame = Heaven. Salsa Chipotle is a close second"}
{"text":"Go early to avoid a long wait. But even with a wait, it's worth it! All four of our meals were superb. We sampled the fish, pork, shrimp and steak tacos, and all were delicious. We tried two with the \"protein option\", which had griddled cheese instead of tortillas, and I don't want to eat them any other way ever again. One of us had the lonche (like a torta), and there wasn't a crumb left. The salsa bar at the beginning of the meal (you help yourself) was unique, and it included 8-10 different kinds of salsas to sample (peanut, pecan, chipotle, tomatillo, etc.)  Definitely worth the trip. Bonus is the little party store next door with pinatas and all the fun fillings."}
{"text":"Veggie taco was awesome and so was the chile verde burro.  Service was good and the server took time to explain several items which was very helpful.  Salsa bar was excellent.  The only negative is the limited seating."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but good experiences with the food at La Santisima, and minor frustrations with a particular attendant can be easily overlooked when the cuisine was that good. 

My real love for this venue is from their simple, lovely drinks--including the best horchata I've had in Phoenix.  Chopped fruit and walnuts? Are you kidding me? Delicious."}
{"text":"Loved the food at the Flagstaff location but when we went to the Phoenix location we were unable to find parking  and the surrounding neighborhood was very scary. I felt it would be easier to score some crack or pick up a prostitute than get a taco.  I traveled all the way from N.California looking forward to trying them again on our vacation but I felt the risk of getting mugged and or raped was simply not worth a burrito."}
{"text":"Small place but good authentic Mexican food. The tacos r bomb and different salsas at the salsa bar. Moderate price."}
{"text":"I've tried a handful of different plates. Everything I've tried so far is good. They have a great selection of salsas. Some have a kick some don't but they are all good. Besides the constant reggae playing in the background the atmosphere is good. One thing I will say and hope you take my advice on is ORDER El Gaucho Quesadilla. If you ordered anything else you gone screwed up. Leave, come back and order El Gaucho Quesadilla. As you consume the best thing on the menu you will instantly feel regret for ordering anything else as well as regret for never being able to order anything else on the menu. I wanted to give this place 4 stars but El Gaucho is well worth the 5th star alone.

(Update 3/21/16) They seemed to have ditched the reggae for Spanish Rock! I mean Jaguares/Caifanes etc.  Definitely a 5 star establishment."}
{"text":"So fantastic! The salsa bar alone is worth going to see, unique tasty salsas. The tacos are big not street tacos, found out after I ordered 5 of them, but had plenty of take homes. Their horchata is the best I've ever had. The place it's self is small so make sure you get there before the rush. But absolutely check it out!"}
{"text":"We were hesitant... Rolled up after dark ... Tired from a lengthy road trip... Exterior was scary.  Interior was delicious.  So glad we were brave enough to walk in.  Amazing menu... Delicious gourmet salsa bar.  Great margarita.  The salsa Fresca with strawberries was incredible... Seating is a little tight, but so glad we discovered this Guy-Fieri-approved 'dive.'  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was pretty tasty, but the service was not. I was ignored by the waitress for ten minutes until she asked if I wanted a menu."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior fool you! This is such a great place. I had 2 Mexican street tacos, Aztec tinga and al pastor. The al pastor was amazing. But plan to get a few - these tacos are tiny! My boyfriend had the Aztec quesa and wow, I will never eat a more delicious quesadilla in my life. The chicken was so well flavored and the tortilla was fried and so delicious. 
The salsa bar was fun. I really enjoyed the strawberry salsa. But I wish there was a more traditional salsa at the bar as well. Highly, highly recommend a visit here."}
{"text":"Service is very, very poor waited for at least 1 hours for food n the server to see you. Not coming back"}
{"text":"Great food, but the service has gone downhill since expanding.  We like the expanded menu. The waitstaff is pleasant, but inattentive.  Example, we came in and a staff member was leaning on the bar chatting, and didn't acknowledge us until another person came from around the bar to seat us.  Great food though."}
{"text":"When they call La Santisima a gourmet taco cafe, they're not kidding- there are so many different types of tacos on the menu, it's overwhelming and difficult to decide what to order! Add in the massive salsa bar and I was a fan before I even tried a bite.

This place is tiny, so go off normal dining hours or expect a wait. We lucked out and got seats at the bar, and ended up getting to try an extra margarita that was accidentally made for a large party. While you wait for your order, cozy up to the salsa bar, where they have ten different options ranging from mild to mouth-on-fire. The strawberry one was my favorite, but the tomatillo was really good too.

We ended up trying five different tacos, and they were all good in their own ways- this is a place to skip the generic fried fish tacos and go for the stuff that's really out there, like chicken mole and things you have difficulty pronouncing correctly. Will be coming back next time I'm in town to try more!"}
{"text":"Overrated 
Overpriced 
Long waits 
Very small location 
Jam-packed
Elbow to elbow tables"}
{"text":"Now with another location opened in Glendale, this taco paradise is truly become a staple place to eat in the state of Arizona! Inspired by the flavors and ingredients of Mexico, you can explore a variety of meals I've already fallen in love with. As you can expect, all ingredients are fresh and flavorful. One of the key things that sets this taco establishment from other larger brand competitors is that they try their best to help you forget about unhealthy, heavy, greasy style Mexican food you've had in America. It's time you experience what actual Mexican food is all about and perhaps you'll never go back to the rest. Popular items such as Quesadillas, Tacos and Burritos come to life with the help of fresh green tomatillos, Oaxacan cheeses, chipotle chiles, flour and corn tortillas. Other amazing things to try include the Horchata beverage, Carne Asada, Baja Sur Shark Tacos and more."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. This place is so amazing, even the rice is delicious!!! We had the shrimp with veggie tacos ( I can't remember the exact name of the dish), Sonoran Carne Asada Taco, and al pastor burro. Every bite is better than the last, and my cousin and I had takeout! I can only imagine what it would've tasted like fresh out the kitchen. We also had strawberry margaritas (non-alcoholic to go), and we added our own tequila at home :-) An amazing last dinner to our weekend trip to Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Hour wait to get food served!
Yes it's gourmet , but way to long of a wait!
Appetizer Arrived with meal. Had to flag someone 
Just to ask for check... maybe they were short on staff. I don't know ,we only had service contact  when ordering."}
{"text":"If this place only served chips and their salsa bar, I would still give it 5 stars!  As a salsa and hot sauce (they're different, people!) fanatic, I tend to judge Mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa - and La Condesa ranks high!  Last time I was there, I counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments (limes, onions, etc.).  They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa, to spicy chipotle, or creamy cilantro.  It looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table, but you have to try them all! 

The horchata here is also 5-star material.  Don't be a cheapskate - shell out the $4 for it! Its giant, it will make you happy. And, when you're done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts - the drink keeps on giving! 

I have been here twice and have only eaten the veggie tacos, 2 of them are enough to fill me up and they are very delicious!  I must say I am not a huge fan of their rice and beans, which seem a bit bland to me.  But, the tacos, salsa and drinks all make up for some plain 'ol rice! 

I was very  happy to see a decent sized crowd here on my most recent visit and that La Condesa is applying for a liquor license.  This place needs to stick around for awhile!"}
{"text":"So I finally got off my yelpn butt and made it on over to La Condesa for lunch today. I got there around 1045, so I was that creepy taco stalker in the parking lot for about 15 minutes. I ordered teh La Condesa Shrmip Burro and the Oaxacan Mole chicken Taco. As I waited, I was able to check out the 8 or 9 different salsas they had there. Great stuff, I only packed up four. My fave, by a mile, was the creamy cilantro salsa. I wanna bathe in that stuff, like now. My food was ready pretty quick and I was in and out, which is nice.The taco was great, I really liked the flavor in the mole. I decided to add some of the peanut salsa the had, which was pretty good. I do have to say the Burro did fall a bit flat for me. there were tons of ingredients in tehre, but somehow it seemed to be a bit bland without adding any of the salsas to it.  Kiinda like that girl you see at the club, and y ou get home and...well, you get the picture. It was a good burro, but the shrimp were somehow flavorless and the bacon was non-existent. Not that I'm total food snob but when you tell me there's bacon in that mug, I wanna taste me some bacon. Overall my meal was good, I'm going to go back another day and try some other things on the menu, like the dogfish taco. Two thumbs up for the creativity on the food and the salsas, it's hard to stand out in teh Phoenix Taco/Burro scene."}
{"text":"There really are few words to describe how perfect the food is, how delectable the salas are, how great the waitstaff is, and how awesome the vibe is. Sufficeth to say, we come here at least twice a month (we have to hold ourselves back!).

Since my husband's from SoCal and I'm a born and bred Austinite, we both grew up eating delicious Mexican food. But I have to say that La Condesa truly beats out even my favorite spots in San Diego or Austin (sorry, hometown! you still have the best migas!). They are truly Taco Royalty.

Our favorite tacos: Mayan Cochinita Pibil, Arrachera (carne asada), the El Guacho, and the shark taco. Also, you must try their margaritas and horchata!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to come here for cinco de mayo thinking it was going to be good. It wasn't. Horrible service who failed to tell us they were out of pastor and horchata. Came to our table once. And our server didn't know what kind of margaritas they served. The tortillas seemed like they were microwaved and the tacos were mediocre. Don't recommend it."}
{"text":"This restaurant, and the one on 16th street, are both outstanding.  The best, most interesting Mexican food in the Phoenix area.  And, reasonably priced.  The portions are so large that we  always end up taking half of it home for another meal.  The dishes are very unique and stunning.  The salsa bar is incredible.  I hardly go anywhere else anymore when I go out to eat, because other restaurants seem so boring and lack imagination, compared to these restaurants.  I just wished they sold their dozens of salsas in carry out jars/bottles.  I would buy all of them!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! So many salsas to choose from!! If you want a taste of authentic Mexican food... Come here!!!"}
{"text":"I could go there just to eat chips and salsa, very good! The tacos are really good too. Small little place with great service and great food."}
{"text":"This place is really wonderful
They have several options for vegans. And the salsa bar is great. I mean theirs so many different salsas to choose from and its all self serve take as much as you need or want.

The only thing missing at La Santisima is fresh hand made tortillas. That would make this place even better.

The inside is very nice. Rustic wooden tables and seats Mexican made. And lots of Mexican art and cultural motifs on the walls. Theirs a bar too.  Its more dimly lit so it gives the cozy feel
Waiters and waitresses are all friendly and attentive. Nice place for lunch or dinner and conversation no need to feel rushed."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on a one day business trip and found this place on yelp. I'm glad I did. The restaurant is small at first but has a variety of home made salsas at the salsa bar. I didn't get a chance to try them all but the ones I had were very good. They have really good service with a friendly server and prompt service. I had the mahi fish taco which was grilled and I also had the chicken taco. Both were excellent with the rice and beans. They give you soft drinks in a to go cup so that was convenient to take with me in the 100 degree weather. 

The food was really good and was better than similar tacos in CA. I'm glad I chose this place for my one meal in AZ before my flight home! One more thing the price was very reasonable and the location was only a couple miles from the Sky Harbor rental car center. Will go back if I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"So many taco and salsa options!! Met up with a friend and we got one of each on the taco Tuesday specials as well as all the salsas. Absolutely recommend you come here if you like options. We also got the margaritas and they were good. Service was a little slow but we were fine because of the bowl of chips and large salsa selection available."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and tried this place out based on previous yelpers. There is a salsa bar which has multiple options to supplement the flavor of your dish. I tried the carnitas burrito and it was probably the best burrito I have ever eaten. The presentation was very good as well. Also - I was there during happy hour and got a YUUGE margarita for less than $5. I'll be back next time I am in town"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! We loved the salsa bar. I can't remember the names of the dishes we had, but everything was delicious. We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and atmosphere!!! Great salsa bar. Fish tacos are some of the most delicious I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Service was poor and it was empty too, around 8:30 pm. I ordered my grandson a bean and cheese burrito. He complained that the burrito was spicy and I thought he was just complaining. Come to find out, it had chili pods in it. We pulled out a couple of pods and the server replied, \"They are added for taste.\" If we wanted a spicy bean and cheese burrito for him I would of added salsa from the salsa bar. The food wasn't all that and we NEVER got offered a refill on our drinks. I will never return to this place as I come back every year to see the Dodgers during their spring training. Save your money and go to a fast food restaurant. You are much better off not to mention their prices..."}
{"text":"Had another awesome experience here at La Santisma last night. Although they were super busy, they managed to serve us promptly and the street tacos were great. I couldn't believe their house margarita was so tasty (and just $6.) Only bad part was I found out which salsa is the hottest for me (the peanut lit my mouth on fire) but all were delicious."}
{"text":"First time coming here! It sounds like they expanded a few months ago to accommodate for the traffic they were getting. There was constant people coming in and out even with the odd time we were there. Even though they were busy the service was fast and friendly. 
They had tons of different Taco options. They had a good variety of vegan, vegetarian, seafood and a salsa bar to woo any salsa lover. I got the 3 street Taco plater the flavor was good only complaint was that some of the meat was dried out which I had to pick out. My husband got some seafood Tacos that he picked here and there. Overall it was a fun experience but I think there are better restaurants to try.

{"text":"I VERY rarely give 5 stars flat out...but the Torta that I had today for lunch blew my mind, so I had to give 5 stars. Honestly this place is amazing and I'm already craving more. 
I ordered the Mayan cochinita pibil Torta (which they call something else) it came with just pickled red onions on top and rice and beans on the side. I was initially worried that I would be too dry or boring because it was so plain, but one bite and I was hooked. That slow roasted pork was to die for. I basically inhaled the entire sandwich. 
My family also ordered some tacos and those were incredible as well. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the beans, they were just a little too watery for my taste but they were still good. 

Highly recommend for satisfying cravable Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"I was so high on this place by all the great reviews, sad to say is that the majority of these people don't know great tasting meat, well, whatever small portion I received. I ordered the al pastor burro and was disappointed, little meat with alot of al pastor sauce, and to much secret sauce. I like the whole concept of mixing spicy with sweet as I got chunks of pineapple in my burro, as stated on the menu. And my michelada also came with a sweet and spicy rim, which i loved. The michelada was delicious but a bit pricy, $18.00 for two. Overall I was disappointed, would I go back? Sure, just for a couple drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and experience. This last time we waited awhile for our order but the server took an item off the check to make up for it! He made great recommendations and was very attentive. My absolute favorite was the shark taco but everything was good. The salsa bar was great and had a bunch of variety from hot to mild. They also have a fab Bloody Mary from what I'm told. 
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This places quality has fallen off bit time. After this last tapatio burro I won't be back for a while. Old not well shredded pork,  not fresh cheese, made me feel bit sick to my stomach. Used to love this place, shame, not at these high prices."}
{"text":"Delicious food with an amazing salsa bar! Their horchata is not your average horchata - I highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I just don't see what all the fuss is about. Yes, the salsa bar is amazing, and the margaritas are yummy, but the food is heavy and somewhat bland. My friend ordered a chicken quesadilla and they brought her a cheese one instead and it had so much cheese in it that it was almost inedible. I got a veggie quesadilla and it was ok. My husband got steak though and it tasted and smelled phenomenal! I would try this place if you like chips and salsa and are looking for huge portions, but wouldn't suggest going out of your way for it."}
{"text":"We wanted to grab lunch before heading to the airport, and La Santisima was the perfect place. The salsa bar provided many tasty options to add to our already delicious lunch. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"OMG! La Condesa, I love you! 

If you drive too fast down 16th on your way downtown, you just might miss this little, neighborhood taco joint...and it will be your loss. 

La Condesa is a delightful little 10-12 seat restaurant with seating also available at the bar. The wait staff are courteous, helpful and knowlegable about the food. There is a salsa bar with no less than 15 freshly made salsas.. everything from your standard pico de gallo to a strawberry jalapeno and a spicy chipotle peanut. We've been here a few times and have not been disappointed. Try the Sonoran Carne Asada Arrachera steak marinated with Mexican herbs, fresh garlic & olive oil, charbroiled with mesquite charcoal or the Mayan Cochinita Roasted Pork Shoulder Taco with marinated onions and salsa habanera. If you order the \"taco plate\" for a few dollars more, you can get sides of their slow cooked beans and rice.

This is a place nice enough to take your mom and trendy (and inexpensive) enough to take your out of town hipster friends. 

Total neighborhood foodie heaven on a budget."}
{"text":"Came here to meet a friend of mine yesterday. We were seated in about 10 min around 8:15pm, so it wasn't super busy. We waited for 15-20 min for a server to greet us, which didn't happen. So finally, I walked up to the the bar area and informed the staff. One lady, who was probably the server in our area, said she'd be with us in just one sec! I went back to the table to wait with my friend. 5 min goes by and still no one came so we got up and left. What an absolute waste of time and no care in the world for their customers. Messing up an order is one thing and fairly understandable, but not a total lack of care and disrespect."}
{"text":"Omg amazing! I had the La Santisima burrito and it was so good!! The horchata was the best I've ever had and the La Santisima margarita was so good! I will definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"Great sign.... Um couple of the salsas were ok.... Chips were spot on...Service was great! Food not so much. I think there trying too hard to be like barrio cafe and honestly fall short. Guy Fieri was too nice. If you like a gringo taco u will love it. I prefer real flavor and authenticity."}
{"text":"Food was great they even serve vegan food  , customer service not so good you have to wait 25 to 30 min to get seated even if they have tables available waiters just walk by you don't say a word to you, salsa bar was pretty much empty at 6pm come on people.... they also serve food in  earthenware dishes you can even smell right in to it..."}
{"text":"Checked out this place about a week ago because I wanted to try some new Mexican food. I was pleasantly surprised with how good everything was. The guacamole with mango, cranberries and jicama seemed odd but I was intrigued. Ended up being the best guacamole I have ever had.

The beer battered shrimp and baby shark tacos were delicious. So good. And last but not least, the quesadilla was amazing. Very similar to an empanada in that they took raw tortilla, stuffed it, then deep fried it. Blew my mind. So good. I might order from them again tonight. It's a little bit of a ride from where I live (25 minutes) but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"They claimed to have mighty good horchata!!
The Horchata was indeed great!! :)
 I liked It! 
But not the best in my opinion, no place like Mexico could ever offer amazing Horchata to me thus far, nothing like the one's you'll find at street taco stands late at night in places like Cuernavaca, Chihuahua, Mexico city and or Acapulco! 
_ Anyways, coming back to La Condesa this place is super tiny, and should consider expanding to make it a bit more comfy, just my opinion! 
The taco platter I had included the Carne Asada , Pacific Fish and Cochinita Pibil taco. All three were okay, and just okay. The rice and bean were also A-ok, nothing too extravagant nor elaborate. I really think this taco shop could do better, they have the potential to, like their amazing salsa bar is a huge kudos to consider, and the staff too so you got that down Condesa, Keep up the good work and plenty of room for improvement if you care to know!"}
{"text":"After almost 2 months of visiting this place, I am still fantasizing about their food!

I trusted my fellow Yelpers when I was taking a road trip with family to Tucson from California and had to stop for dinner on the way.  The Yelpers' raving reviews did not let us down.  When we got there it actually looked closed from the outside especially since the OPEN sign wasn't lit, but we took a chance and opened the door anyway to find that it was indeed open.  

It's a tiny little place with a Dia de los Muertos theme, so it was rich with color and culture.  There was only one server so it was a little slower than we'd like, but in her defense, she was pregnant. 

We each had to order the horchata with pecans and melon because it sounded so good.  The cup it came in was HUMUNGOUS and thank goodness for that because it was awesomely delicious!  We also pigged out on the chips and variety of salsas at the salsa bar.  The salsas are seriously amazing and there were a lot to choose from and taste.  I especially loved the jicama salsa.  

I ordered 2 carne asada tacos with rice and beans.  I was already so full from eating all those chips and horchata and usually it's hard for me to enjoy the taste of something after I'm super full, but the tacos were so good I finished them.  I only tasted a little bit of the rice, which was okay... probably my least favorite thing I ate there, but the beans were very good!  

I was soooo full afterwards and I left with a smile on my face and a new favorite restaurant that I'll have to stop at whenever I'm in Phoenix, which isn't very often, sadly."}
{"text":"OMG! Second time I've been here and will try to go everytime I'm in Phoenix! Most incredible flavors, fresh, wonderful salsa bar - can't say enough about this little place that you could miss if you simply driving up or down 16th St.  Don't miss it!!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here. The mole chicken tacos were easily the best I've had north or south of the border. The food quality and flavors are second to none. A welcome departure from the standard tex-mex. The salsas were so fresh and interested four immediately jumped onto my plate. A cels toro, peanut, strawberry , and chipotle. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"If the food and salsa weren't off the hook incredible, I would have given just 1 star.  Apparently I went to LCGTS on a really bad night.  But they pulled off a tasty miracle.  My pal and I went to LCGTS on our way to see Cheech and Chong at the Dodge Theater.  So we were up for some good Mexican food munchies.

We walk in and there is a line... okay no big deal.  BUT there were no forks (we had to eat with spoons and fingers).  There were no napkins, and the salsa bar was bone dry.  I mean the salsa trays looked like they had been licked clean by a starving dog.  They were able to replenish the salsa but they completely ran out of forks.  We got no chips and no drinks.  We had to beg the poor, nice girl who was completely stressed out.  They were a tad understaffed.  It was a \"trip\".  

But somehow they managed to bring out my dish.... a Chicken Mole burrito and a Carne Asada Steak taco.  OMG were they amazing.  The flavors of those dishes and the flavors of the AMAZING salsa were just super.  The meat in that taco was cooked to perfection.  Crusty bits of steak that had a crunchy sear but were still very tender on the inside.  I didn't mind not having a fork.

While we were there, they LOCKED the door, just like Cheech Marin did in the Vampire den in \"From Dusk till Dawn\".  We were locked in as prisoners.  Apparently they were closing down at 6:45 p.m. due to being understaffed and not having forks or more salsa.  Luckily, my buddy and I were the last people to be served.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here after my boyfriend had done seen it on Yelp. It is not by any means a large spacious restaurant. However, the best Mexican restaurants are primarily a hole in the wall. 

We split the House Margarita. We had asked for no salt but it still came salted. It was good,  although I don't like salt on my margarita when I am trying one for the first time because I want to know what it tastes like without anything added.

I got a lot of food (because I couldnt decide what to get). I got the traditional Quesadilla which is ironically not a traditional quesadilla. It is a corn tortilla  folded over that has Oaxaca Cheese inside and its fried. Its kinda like a Calzone but better. If I had to pick a cheese that could possibly be my favorite cheese in Mexican cuisine it would be Oaxaca. The Quesadilla was amazing but it is HUGE. I was expecting something around the size of my hand.  Nope, one half was probably the size of my hand. We did ask for no crema but they still put it on there. I also got the Conchita Lonche, the meat was delicious but the bread was kinda hard. It does come with mustard, which I was not expecting. It would be a great thing to order for Lunch for anyone who works downtown (which I do).  My boyfriend got the shark taco but I was not up for trying it mainly because I barely eat fish tacos when it is cod inside. It did look good displayed on his plate. I didn't get to try the beans but the rice was good. I have a hard time judging rice because I still believe my Nana makes the best white rice. 

The service wasn't bad but the woman was the only one really taking care of tables and about 4 tables including us walked in probably within 5 mins. So she was running around taking orders, running food and then touching back to the tables to see if anything was alright.  

In the end, I definitely am coming back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.100% authentic Mexican food. Me and my co workers always choose to go there for lunch. Their salsa bar has many great options and their horchata is delicious. 

I do have a couple of complaints to say; during lunch time the place gets packed and has very limited space. The dining area is very small. Some portion sizes are unreasonable for the prices they charge (ex: torta below charged at $9.00) And the waitress/cashier during the day, skinny with black hair is extremely rude. She has no customer service what so ever. She seems bothered when you ask her questions about their menu or just in general. If you read through the reviews I'm not the only one who thinks so. She makes our visits  very unpleasant. 

Other than that I recommend the quesadillas. I gave this review 4 stars because of the food but if I had to go by service then I would give one"}
{"text":"My burrito tonight was not the same as the many I have had before here. It was mostly rice not meat, so disappointed.
Please go back to your roots or you will lose your loyal customers!"}
{"text":"Salsa bar had so many delicious choices and flavorful options that I was beside myself with excitement! The street tacos were so tasty and unique flavors has me come my back for more!!! Can't wait for my next trip back to this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS EVER!

Gourmet tacos are fantastic but these are the best of the best.  The al pastor tacos as well as the al pastor quesa are amazing.  The pork is marinated and has great flavor, the inclusion of pineapple adds sweetness which works great with the savory flavor of the pork.  My personal favorite is the chicken mole which is not for everyone but I love it.  The mole sauce has great depth of flavor.  It is made from unsweetend cocoa and chiles.  Unusual but delicious!  

The salsa bar has a great selection.  I recommend the chipotle salsa with its smoky flavor.  The tomotillo and guacamole are excellent."}
{"text":"There were 4 empty tables open......and plenty of people waiting to be seated......this lasted for over 20 minutes. The staff just kept staring at us, leaving dirty empty tables. 

We finally Sat down after an hour of waiting. No water for 20 minutes. They finally come by to give us 1 glass of water and chips (80% crumbs) and they didn't come back to take our meal order for 17 more minutes. 

Over 2 hours of being in the restaurant, they tell me they have no more horchata. Wtf.  8pm on a Saturday???? No sorry but we ran out of what you already ordered and have been waiting on.....nothing. Everyone around us had one. Even people who showed up after us. 

Finally gave us our food---which ended up tasting pretty good.....but NO UTENSILS. I had to get up, go to the front and ask for some. Duh. 

Then our bill came and they charged us for the horchatas that we didn't even get. 

Absolutely horrible. They were so rude. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Everyone loves the salsa bar, but I find it mediocre. Sure it has more salsas than most places, with a wider variety -- but it's just not what I expect from salsa. It's fun to try, but it's not something I would do it again. 

With the above average prices, and the mediocre salsa bar, it's definitely 3 stars for me."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years for the food. It's awesome. The service might be the worst of any restaurant I've ever been to though. Saturday night, 8pm. The restaurant is 40% full with 15 people standing by the bar waiting for a table for 20 minutes. Their famous salsa bar is half empty and has been for 30 minutes. Not one person working there is hustling. I ask who the manager is. Oh, they're at the other store. No owner or manager on on your busiest night at dinner rush? Whoever runs the show here is leaving a lot of money on the table and regularly disappointing your patrons."}
{"text":"Probably not much I can say that hasn't already been said....La Santisima has delicious food and a killer salsa bar. I really enjoyed the chicken asado taco. I also had a fish taco that I wasn't the biggest fan of, but I could see how others might like it. In my opinion, it had too much breading on the fish. 
Oh, and the margaritas...yummy!  
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came because of the ratings.  I made a stop in Phoenix prior to Sedona.  

We had breakfast tacos and breakfast burrito with yellow rice and black beans refrito.  The agua de Jamaica was perfect!  Chilled and not so sweet!!!  

The decoration is so colorful.  I saw many locals here too."}
{"text":"My friends love this place (seriously one of them has gone there like 10 times within a few months) and I have to say, it was pretty good. I love their salsas. There is this one, I can't remember the name of it, but it was so delicious.  If I remember correctly, The peanut one was not tasty at all. Their tacos was unique and tasty. I also got a burrito, it was good too. It is a little pricey, $$ for sure."}
{"text":"Came here to check out a New Mexican spot and it is definitely my favorite. Everything is fresh and tastes amazingly good!! I tried their shark taco and my brother had their fried quesadillas  Great service too. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Went with my family for a birthday celabration. We had a bad experience. First of all the service was horrible, the food was overpriced for the portion served. They forgot one of our orders and still  charged. The waitress was rude and never returned to the table. The fastest thing we got was the check rather than the food. I do not recommend this restaurant unless u like overpriced food and bad service."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I will definitely be returning soon! The horchata was the best I've ever had. Not too sweet but comes in 32oz portions. The casadillas are insane! More like a deep fried calzone. Delicious. Gaucho Burrito was also incredible. 15 salsas to choose from. Parking a little tough but don't let it hold you back from visiting this gem."}
{"text":"The saddest thing about this place is that it's more than 2,000 miles from my house. Hands down, best street tacos I've ever had! Mix and match them if you go."}
{"text":"The package is beautiful and the gift is thoughtful . The giant quesadilla is awesome to look at as it sits down in front of you but lack the big punch you would expect the dough lacks flavor . The salsa bar is large and has unusual salsas that are all good in there own way. The sandwiches are great the bread top notch. Hands down the tacos or at least the fillings are very very good wish they took the time to made a hand made tortilla to support the amazing fillings ."}
{"text":"Food is consistently amazing.  Service is consistently deplorable. There is absolutely no efficiency, management, or organization. 

 Last time we had to order cocktails 3 times before we got them and ask for the check 4 times until we threatened to leave. So, here we are. ...

Today, we waited 40 minutes within their new expanded dining room.  3 servers, a hostess, and a bartender overseeing 8 tables and shooing customers off tell them 45 minute to an hour wait for a 3/4 empty restaurant.

There was a sauce covered bean in the bottom of our chip bowl and a shard of glass on the table when we were seated. Both pictured.

Ordered drinks and meals immediately upon being seated;  knowing the glacial pace witnessed so far and after another 20 minutes, we have an empty chip bowl, empty cocktails, and still no entrees or even a visit from a moving person.

What a success this place could be if anyone cared or even knew what they were doing attempting to run a business."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the food here is usually great. The pacific white fish taco is perfect. The salsa bar is just alright. My real complaint here is the service. Every time I walk in the servers all just ignore me until I actually say something like \"uh hi I'm here to eat food\" it's very awkward and makes you feel unwelcome. I'm an industry person and I really can't imagine letting a table sit for that long without at least checking on them. Bad vibes."}
{"text":"First time here we stopped because this place has vegan options. You do have to read the menu carefully because some tacos/burritos have cheese and cream.  I had the coliflor al pastor it was very good. Large portions and the have a great salsa bar as well"}
{"text":"Food is good, atmosphere is good, but service is lousy.  We were seated and waited 15 minutes to get a menu.  The hostess that seated us was more concerned with her broken nail than giving us menus.  We ordered but never saw our waitress again until we were ready to leave.  We had a couple of beers but we had to go up to the bar and get it ourselves.  When our dinner was served after quite a wait, we had to ask for silverware.  Not sure we will go back."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the entire world. Amazing salsa bar, fruity margaritas and a very friendly staff. Always great service. Tell ya friends and fam, La Santisima is the best."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch - the salsa bar was superb. Lots of selection - none were very hot though including the \"de arbol\". It took a while for the server to take my order and even longer to get a drink of water. I I ordered the Sonoran Arrecheta tacos and they were delicious - basically carne asada with cabbage. The server let my food sit in the window for a while and never came back around to fill my water. So because the food was ok but the service was terrible on many fronts it gets a two star review."}
{"text":"Small place but its delicious, I cleaned my plate. Arrachera, mariachi,asada,chilango tacos were amazing. served with white rice full of flavor and beans (wish there was just a bit more beans) but plates are fulfilling. 
salsa bar has so much selection, cilantro,peanut,sesame,pecan,jicama...and so much more. Definitely recommend  this place."}
{"text":"I had this restaurant bookmarked for a while after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. We were attending a show in Downtown Phoenix, so we went by La Santisima before that. It was around 6-ish in the evening when we arrived and there were only 1 or 2 small tables open, so we were seated immediately. Getting to the table was kind of like walking through a maze since the restaurant is small and crowded.

It was very obvious that they were super busy and there were only 2 people taking orders, delivering food, etc. It took a while for them to take our orders and then even longer to bring us chips to snack on & our drinks. When they did, however, we were more than happy to wait for our food as we were were enjoying all the different salsas with the chips!

The salsa bar they have is very unique. They had very flavorful salsas that I've never had before. My favorite was the peanut one. It was kind of thick and creamy with a bit of spice. Other salsas that both me and my boyfriend liked were the pecan salsa, the salsa roja, the guacamole, etc. There were a total of maybe 10 or 12 different ones, all that tasted great with the chips and also on our tacos. I'd come back here just because of the salsa bar!

As far as our food goes, I ordered the Tinga taco and the Cabo Shrimp taco plate with rice and beans. My boyfriend ordered the La Santisima Speciality tacos with chicken. Both the tacos I ordered were completely different from each other. The Tinga taco tasted good as it was served but I thought that the shrimp taco needed a couple of salsas to enhanced the flavor of the breaded shrimp. The La Santisima Speciality tacos were much like the Tinga taco in that there were a bunch of different toppings on them, so they tasted great as served. My boyfriend couldn't help but to add the delicious salsas on them anyways, however!

Next time, we come in, I'd probably skip both the rice & beans and instead order one more taco! It's not that the rice & beans weren't good, it was just that the tacos were SO GOOD! It's great that everything that can be ordered a la carte or as a meal. Some tacos are bit more expensive than other ones, but the whole menu seemed fairly reasonably priced.

Overall, like I've said, the food was great but the service is where there could be some improvement. We'd recommend this restaurant to others!"}
{"text":"This was me and my wife's first time to the Gourmet taco shop. We absolutely loved it. Great salsa bar, best horchata ever and classic take on Mexican food. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. The chicken mole tacos are killer and the only reason they're getting two stars instead of one.   A confluence of negatives brought what should have been a five-star review down - fast.

1. Our waiter didn't have his heart in it.  He barely smiled, didn't share any pleasantries and was drier than toast.  No offer to refill water, to show us the dessert menu.  Just overall lacking in basic customer service skills.  

2. When was the last time you went to a Mexican restaurant and didn't bring home a doggy bag?   The portions here are for a bride-to-be trying to lose weight before a wedding.  The shape of the rice was a 1/4 measuring cup.  The refried beans were about 2 tablespoons worth.

3. The wait for menus.  The wait to be acknowledged.  The wait for drinks.  The wait for the meal.  The wait for the check.  i wanted to belt out that tacky song: \"Cuando, cuando, cuando?!?\"

4. The temperature.  Lukewarm food is not cool.  It sat somewhere for some unknown reason.  I'd usually send it back but damn!  I thought I'd eat next week.

5. The outside at night.  What's up with the no lights?  We drove by the first time because we had no idea it was open.  

6. The margaritas are creative but DAMN!  Inordinately expensive.  We are not on the Upper East SIde of Manhattan.

7.  The plates.  I guess they're reminiscent of Mexican pottery but they looked like they could contain lead.  No bueno.  

The salsa bar is killer - they make their own unusual and tasty concoctions (pecan salsa?).  Quite lovely.  

But they really need to step up their game and stop resting on the laurels of Diners, Drive Ins and Dives."}
{"text":"Came across this place on yelp and needed to fill up after our flight in. The food was beyond my expectations; I ordered the mole burro and it was amazing. The mole was the best I'd ever had - chocolatey, nutty and savory/sweet. The accompanying rice was a standout for me too. We ordered the caramel flan and that was amazing too. Go here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the city. I love the salsa bar which has a revolving variety of seasonal choices. I love the pecan and strawberry. There is a great variety of Sonoran style tacos as well as street tacos. My mom loves that they do protein style tacos where they cook the filling in cheese rather than tortillas since she is on a low carb diet. The atmosphere looks like a restaurant you would find in Mexico with old wooden doors and dia de los muertos decor."}

{"text":"Embarrassingly upset that I lived in the Phoenix area for a few years and had never tried this dive. Heresy. I am ashamed.  I am bitter.  But when i think about the food I suddenly feel better, willing to let bygones be bygones.  It has some simply amazing street tacos and probably the best salsa bar I have ever encountered. 

Easy to miss (when driving and also after not eating there for a few days), so prepare! If only their cool Dia de Los Muertos t-shirts came in big guys sizes.  I would've bought the pink one, even."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place again. It's a lot bigger than before the food tasted great! I am in love with their horchata but it's a little pricey. The only negative thing I have to say is to move the salsa bar away from where the restroom is at, kinda gross."}
{"text":"SO good!  I love the enchis and how there is a salsa bar...a little pricey in my opinion but it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Dear 16th Street,

Please continue to bring it!  Just yesterday a colleague at school told me he thought Barrio Cafe's food was diminishing in oomph.   I disagreed, but that evening, I just so happened to bike over to La Condesa to try out this new gourmet taco place on 16th.

The cursive red neon sign, that word \"gourmet\" and the dozens of Yelp endorsements ushered us in on a Tuesday night.  Warm walls. Original paintings. Furnishings from Bellas Artes de Mexico.  The most substantial wooden tables and chairs in central Phoenix.  When we had opportunity in our conversation to \"knock on wood,\" we felt a bit shamed by the feebleness of our gesture and the robustness of the table.  Order at the counter from a cheerful and demure young lady, whose accent we could not place.

I linger on the ambiance because others have noted the stellar food.

Your food food for thought:  Come for the two taco meal (with beans & rice (with corn!)), and stay for the fresh and diverse salsa bar.  This isn't Baja Fresh.  This is Condesa cuisine.  Think jicama and orange salsa.  Think peanut salsa. And the creamiest, zingiest cilantro creme salsa!

I must disagree with Lali about the beans: America's Tacos' are more memorable, but you are still right, Lali, on a technicality -- the beans at America's are not pinto...It's a secret. Not really. Ask them."}
{"text":"We were traveling in Arizona, found this place on the show website of Diners Driveins and Dives

The number of vegetarian options they have is second to no other mexican restaurants we have dined in. You can eat here just for their salsa bar if nothing else.
They have about 15 varieties of salsas most of which are awesome!

We got the chicken mole burro, beer battered avocado and cactus tacos, all of which were great.The food took a while to arrive, it gave us plenty of time to try their salsa bar

The service was great. Will definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Mexican style food in Phoenix is both varied and plentiful, so any restaurant that can lure me in to being a regular is doing something right. 

La Condesa is a hip little taco shop on 16th street, close enough for me to walk to. The decor is a trendy/traditional mash up that works well. Honestly, the food is good enough that I'd probably buy it from a guy in an alley. 

I've sampled several different varieties of meat based products as well as the beans. Everything has been well prepared and fresh. The Mayan Cochinita Pibil in particular is drool-worthy. It's mildly sweet and super tender. Adding a little of the chipotle salsa really sets it off. 

Ah, the salsa. There are some truly interesting varieties, from tamarind to pecan. The pecan salsa was a great surprise, with a nice amount of heat. It really sits well with the carne asada. 

My only negative comment involves the parking situation. The parking lot is situated in such a way that in order to leave you have to back out onto 16th street. If a big ass SUV with tinted windows happens to park next to you (which always seems to happen) then pulling out can be...invigorating. 

La Condesa now has a well earned spot of honor in my restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Looooove their salsa bar. The food is good too and the prices are reasonable for sure. The service wasn't the best though. It might have just been that day, but I had to get up 3x to ask for things because the waitress didn't return."}
{"text":"I ordered the arrachera and the mariachi tacos. I feel the hype was too much. The arrachera tasted like it was seasoned in a pound of salt. To me, it wasn't such a pleasant taste. The mariachi tacos tastes like they were missing salt. One of them seemed like it even had way too much oil. However the beans and rice were real good. Aside from an angry lady behind us, the atmosphere was pleasant and really really enjoyed trying all the different salsas that they have."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food really good place. Service was very good all the staff is very nice. I would definitely come back and recommend this place! Five stars!!"}
{"text":"This place has a great salsa bar, and it's veggie/vegan friendly!  The tacos and burros are delicious!  It's a small place with great food and friendly service.  I love it."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, salsa bar is bangin, and they have delicious and original vegan and vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken tinga and dogfish shark tacos. The tinga was packed with flavor. My companion had the chicken mole taco, and I have to say that's what I'll get next time. It was the perfect combination of heat and sweet. Victoria beer rounded everything off. Service was adequate.
If you're looking for Mexican food off the beaten path, try La Santisima."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place not knowing it is a trendy eatery that is usually over crowded and full of wanna be foodies.
The menu has some moments of brilliance but often lacks sensibility. Take the strawberry or peanut butter salsas. Nice try but not ready for primetime. 
The corn Quesadillas are made with masa and rice flour to give the turnovers a nice crispy crunch and fantastic flavor. 5 stars for the taste!
Loss of two stars is simply for the stupid furniture that is packed in like you would with a moving truck. Just too dammed confined. They would be better off putting a couple tables out front to serve. Trying to squeeze into one of their small tables I almost knocked one of their priceless works of art that are just hanging balanced on a nail. 
If the chef can mature and work on some of his experimental flavors this little eatery should have customers for years. 
However if they continue to operate under such cramped conditions people will stop coming in just because of the logistics."}
{"text":"Super good food!! I went here a month or so ago! Great selection!"}
{"text":"Excellent !!! looked up the place before our trip to Colorado, decided to stop in Phoenix for dinner.  We had a 30 min wait, but it was so well worth it, the food was amazing!!.. the owner was very kind and started us on drinks while we waited for a table.  The staff is very courteous, the food is phenomenal.. the price is a little up there, but then again it's not your local Taco shop, this is definitely gourmet tacos at it's best.  I loved their Shrimp tacos!! and of course their cochinita pibil quezadillas were lickity good.. everything on the menu looks very very good."}
{"text":"After moving from San Diego, CA I found the best Mexican food here. Vegetarian/Vegan is just awesome. Food quality is great, clean and variety of sauces excellent. They just need to improve their setting chairs. It's very old and foam coming out."}
{"text":"There is the salsa bar with around a dozen house made salsas.  I am truly amazed by this place. It is small so not recommended for big groups.  Maybe a second date if you notice a parking spot open as you are approaching.  Horchata with chopped nuts, fruit, and cinnamon for the win."}
{"text":"I don't know how you say amazing in Spanish but that is the only way to describe this restaurant. It gets better every time I come. Muchas Gracias!!!!"}
{"text":"Might just be the best Mexican food in Arizona. Not exaggerating by even the slightest. Their flavors are so bold and incredible. Whatever Mexican dish you like they make the best version of it I can guarantee it. I love this place."}
{"text":"Petty expensive for ordinary street tacos. Our server was friendly, but service was slow and disorganized.  Half of the many salsas at the bar were empty. Not a well run operation. Food had good flavor, but for the price I am sure there are better options. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Whatever you do plan on ordering a Cabo shrimp taco. Trust me.

Update - second time back had the Baja Shark Taco and the traditional quesa. 

You can't go wrong with anything here but I would highly recommend everything I've mentioned so far.

And the service was much better this time, came on a Saturday."}
{"text":"With it being a long wait, that might have been what boosted this from 4 to a 5 star.  That said, the salsa bar and the gourmet tacos were spot on.  Oh yeah, if you are a man and see a bathroom door open next to the salsa bar, that is not for you.  The men's room is hidden over by the bar and kitchen.

Its great food.  I tried not to waste any salsa so I just got small cups and kept going back and trying new stuff.  Most of which were good, but one of the chili ones tasted kind of fishy for some reason.  As for my entree I went with 3 tacos with beans and rice.  I ate the fried shrimp tacos first as I didn't want the batter to get soggy.  The mole taco was spot on as well as the especial.

I don't live in the southwest, so I can't really compare to much, but I thought it was a great meal for not too much money."}
{"text":"Overrated and expensive. The food seems \"toned-down\" to me. It can be loud and cramped, and parking can be a pain. The best thing about it may be the extensive salsa bar. There are so many better options here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I, unfortunately, rarely make it out to this part of town. When I do, I tend to go an binges, scarfing down food from one or two of my favorite spots, and adding a new place that has been on my must-try list. This time, it was La Condesa. 

Everything about La Condesa took me by surprise, regardless of the high expectations I already had. I loved its interior--the small space, the rustic wood furniture, the artwork, everything. A big departure from the usual feel of cheap-mexican restaurants/taquerias, it felt homey, warm, inviting. I was expecting to just shoot a quick order to the girl at the counter, but instead got table service, and extremely friendly and attentive service to boot (sounds like it's usually an order-at-the-counter place, though). 

On to the food: don't expect the usual suspects at the salsa bar--these salsas and toppings were phenomenal. I didn't ask, but I suspect they were all made in-house, and seemed incredibly fresh and were really a unique assortment. A great mellow, nutty peanut sauce, smokey chipotle salsa, creamy/salty cilantro, an awesome Mexican (or was it Mayan?) salsa (my favorite of what I tried)...my only regret was not sampling more.

What I loved about the menu were the unique options that branched far beyond the usual suspects. I went with three tacos: tinga, mole, cochinita pibil. When they arrived, all of them looked beautiful, and were surprisingly and thankfully chocked-full of meat. I took one bite of the mole and...HO...LY.....SHIT. Ever go to a restaurant and casually take a bite of something without giving it too much thought, only to be immediately punched in the face by its deliciousness? I love it when this happens. It's one of those pure joys in life, and happens far too infrequently...but it happened here. I'm a sucker for any type of mole, but sometimes they fall a bit 'flat'. This one did not. It had a fantastic bite and complexity to it that really elevated the mole to one of the best I've had. The tinga and cochinita were both equally great. The meat in all three was insanely tender and flavorful from the great sauces they had simmered in.

I paid the bill--$9.80--and realized that it was an awesome deal. Sure, you can find tacos in town for less than $3/ea, but they will not be like these. Not to mention, the portions were generous, I got free chips and a run at the salsa bar. 

I drove home feeling like I was teetering on the edge of purging...this was, after all, my second substantial meal in the course of 1 hour. But it was well worth it. Adding yet another spot to my list of places I have to hit when in the area. Already searching for an excuse."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed La Condesa numerous times. I am stuck on the La Condesa Shrimp tacos. Awesomely fresh and I love the spinach instead of lettuce. Beer is cold, service is slow, but very good. Before my trip last week I would have ranked at least 4 stars, but the shrimp were NOT deveined. Not only mine, but my friend who went with me. I had 2 shrimp tacos & she had one with a carne asada. She loved the carne asada. I don't know that I can eat the shrimp again...what a bummer."}
{"text":"This place is epic. The menu is extensive (almost overwhelming, you have to read it slowly) and offers so many awesome combination. Taco lovers: meet your new favorite place. In addition to awesome tacos they even have a great salsa bar where you can try all sorts of salsas with different heat levels which really add flavor to your tacos. I HIGHLY suggest the La Santisima taco with steak: it's out of this world!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed and sad.  Saw this place on Check Please and saw that the Yelp! reviews were raving, but I can't give a great review. 

1.  Service - poor.  Had to ask for a menu, way too long of a wait time for every.thing., did not get attention I expected, such as a water refill..., had to ask about my food (which conveniently \"just finished\", but it had been sitting based on the cool temperature of the food).  Literally there for over an hour on 1 plate order.  

2.  Food - mediocre.  The rice was good.  The tacos were nothing special.  The salsa bar is impressive, especially the pecan salsa, but unfortunately there is only so much salsa and chips you can eat.  Plate was less than $10, but I wanted gourmet tacos.

3.  Atmosphere - not enough room.  Someone actually took my tot's seat when we went to the bathroom...?

I'd like to assume this just wasn't my day..."}
{"text":"Don't miss out on this place! The food is delicious and authentic, and the atmosphere is hip and comfortable. Their salsa bar is awesome!"}
{"text":"Came to La Santisima for some authentic street tacos. Read the reviews on Yelp and had to check it off.

The selection of tacos and salsa is ridiculous. They have so many!! 
I kept it simple and had adobada tacos with beans and rice. Really really good. 
Definitely authentic! The beans reminded me of my mom's beans.  
I appreciated all the gluten free options as well. Decorations were cool! 

I gave it a 4 star because the gourmet tacos were a little over priced. Somewhere between 3.95-4.80 a taco. Other than that, everything was great."}
{"text":"Get here early! Parking is tight and the line gets long. But it is so worth it! The rice & beans are fantastic. I got the Mexic burro, it has a mango salsa inside that ands a little sweetness that was unexpected and so yummy. They have a ton of vegetarian options, so I will be suggesting this place to my Veggie friends!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is outstanding, and it's a great place for lunch. It offers free chips and a salsa bar, and the hardest part was limiting myself to just a few salsas. The 3 I had were great. Chicken mole torta (though they don't call it a torta) is rich and tasty, just right. I'm glad they offered a Groupon; I'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  This small place doesn't have a lot of adequate seating but it has an amazing salsa bar.  Let's get something straight.  A salsa bar consists of more than the standard 3 to 4 salsas.  This place had about 20.  You can tell that some of them were experiments that went well like Peanut salsa and I believe there was a curry salsa.  There were so many.  

We ordered the famous baja sur dogfish shark taco, an El Gaucho burrito and an El Gaucho quesadilla.  I am not a big fan of quesadillas because of the flour tortilla and there is usually not a good filling.  This one was deep fried goodness.  Oh man, it was so good that I could only get down half of it.  The filling was steak, cucumber and just hell goodness.  My husband's burrito had majority of the same filing as mine with a little tweaking.  He enjoyed it a lot.  The fish taco was really good as well.  I only had one bite because I was aggressively attacking my quesadilla and fighting off the stares of people watching me enjoy.

With all that being said, customer service is once again an issue.  The small place was pretty packed.  Only one small table was open right by the door.  This table had to be misplacement because who would want to sit by the door and every time someone opens the door, they get smacked in the back of the head?  Our waiter was so non-existent that a waitress would come over to only end up doing the same thing.  Sigh.  The food was so good; I couldn't even dock any points for that.  Be aware that the first bowl of chips is free.  The second bowl is about $2 more.  The chips are good and hot so, I willingly gave over my money for an extra bowl."}
{"text":"Great little place.  Could tell it would be fantastic by the lineup to get in.

Very good tacos and an even better salsa bar. Decor is spot on.

Pricing was very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Food was very good, actually. The only thing I didn't care for was that the salsa bar wasn't very full, and they didn't pay much attention to it. They were busy though, so it wasn't a deal breaker. I still enjoyed my food, though."}
{"text":"Looking for something different when you crave \"Mexican?\" Try this little gem. You will never be disappointed. Promise!! (Start with anything al pastor.)"}
{"text":"My hands down favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. The dishes are complex & very flavorful. Great salsa bar too. The horchata is out of this world."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service!!!! They have good food, but the service is so awful that it's truly not worth your time.  The staff is unprepared and rude. Sat for a while without being even noticed and once we were served they never came back. Horrible service! Other people around us got their food to go due to the service and the staff was ignoring other tables as well! Numerous customers were upset. Go to their other location, it's much more friendly and the staff is on top of things."}
{"text":"salsa bar alone is worth visiting, types you wont ever see anywhere. the pork shoulder and quesadilla's are so good! enjoy"}
{"text":"Amazing! Found this Place through Yelp while trying to find a good place to eat with a good Vegetarian selection & We're NOT DISAPPOINTED! The Energy/Environment inside is Very Pleasant, the Paintings inside are Stunning. Our server was Alan, he was very helpful & nice, answering our questions. My Fiance had the Steak Tacos & Margarita. I Ate the La Santisima Veggie Burrito, I'm in LOVE with it! Also I would Recommend try the Cilantro Salsa, the Guacamole one is GOOD but it is also Very Spicy. (There are many kinds of salsa) Service A+ Food A+ Energy Just a really Good Place  We Will Definitely be Coming Back, Regularly.  I Wish I could give MORE STARS!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best taco/burrito places in Phoenix. Tiny place so it gets packed quickly but well worth the wait. Love the salsa bar and Margs too."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is quick and friendly and the food is great! There are more than enough vegetarian options and too much good salsa to try! My favorite was the cilantro and the pecan dressing. They are so fresh and the food didn't take long to come at all. I will definitely visit again next time I'm in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Got to be my favorite place in Phoenix!!!

I've lived here 12 years, and La Santisima wins. Best Margaritas in town!

The quesadilla is amazing (enough for 2), definitely unique and delicious!

Love this place! So don't go there, I need to keep it quaint!!! Just kidding of course...."}
{"text":"I went here with my family and it was a really good experience. We waited only 10 minutes for a party of four, and we got seated promptly after that. 

The assortment of salsas are incredible, my favorite is the avocado and the strawberry salsas. I had a burrito that was one of the most popular ones and it was absolutely delicious. 

Check out this unique place if you're looking for a great taco spot!"}
{"text":"Tacos were awesome and such a large selection of salsa at salsa bar. Severs were very nice. All around great choice!"}
{"text":"We drove down from Prescott, for the day, to do a little shopping and found this place via Yelp. 

SO glad we decided to drive the extra 20 minutes to get there (despite being surrounded by restaurants at the mall). 

This place is good for vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters alike.  I chose the Ghandi and the veggie tacos (cactus), while my friend had meaty street tacos. The food was fresh & delicious and the portion size was perfect.  

Loved the salsa bar!!  Other reviewers mentioned the dried cranberries in the guacamole. It was a delicious sweet addition and the guac was perfect!

We will definitely return for a meal next time we're in Phoenix hungry for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Love how their menu basically blasts TexMex as giving Mexican food a bad representation. Now this is authentic Mexican food. Not some heavy just because we're Americans portion. 

Ordered a lonches. Because they wanted to be different from a torta. But even in the mindset of what a standard torta is, these lonches are WAY BETTER. Bread sustains itself to the fillings (instead of falling apart or soaking up stuff like a torta bread does. Ordered shark. So that was different. There was a freshness to it due to a cucumber to give it a nice crispness to each bite. Brother ordered the al pastor lonche and he thoroughly enjoyed it as well. Girlfriend ordered the mole quesadilla. And yes yes yes! Delivered on the multiple layers of spices within the mole. Man, have I always only had flat moles (such a sad fact). Now, I can imagine not being able to order mole from anywhere else ever again! Eeeek! But do give it a try. Oh, and this quesadilla looked more like a dessert. But nope. A nice balance between the spices of the mole, meat (chicken), and cotija cheese that's sprinkled over it. 

Also tried their horchata. Once again, flavors up the Ying-yang! Theirs nuts, melons, freshly mashed strawberries. So definitely not your typical Americanized Mexican restaurant. 

Tip: don't park in the front. It's extremely difficult to back out into the busy traffic street. Especially if you're alone. Somewhat more doable if you have someone standing outside the car giving your a thumbs up.

Remember: food adventures are out there. So eat 'em up!"}
{"text":"Everything here is exceptional. Full bar with a decent beer selection of domestics and Mexican. Huge salsa bar. My favorite was the strawberry salsa. The salsa Mexicana was good, a little on the spicy side for me but I couldn't stop eat it!

I had the white pacific fish tacos with rice and beans.  The tacos were delicious with lightly fried fish, cabbage, cilantro salsa, and a delicious creamy sauce.  Everything was so good, I wish I leaved in the area or could take this restaurant home with me so I could try everything on the menu!

We arrived around 1130am on a Friday and around noon the place was packed, and it's a small place with limited seating.  Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Their tacos did not disappoint! I had their mahi al pastor, chimichurri steak, and chicken mole tacos. The chimichurri steak was just whatever but the mahi al pastor was really flavorful. Their black mole was silky rich and I appreciated the pickled onions that came with it to brighten the flavors. They had a spicy avocado salsa with a real kick and you really can't knock the huge basket of fresh chips you get while you're waiting! Can't wait to come back and try more tacos!"}
{"text":"This place is a must!  I was craving good Mexican food and this definitely hit the spot.  The Horchata was TO DIE FOR!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the restaurant set up. We arrived around 12:45pm. When you walk in its crowded with tables, so you're scanning for an open seat to grab before ordering.  While I waited at the table my friend stood in line to order. After standing in line for 15 mins they told her at 1pm they change to serving the tables.  Eventually a waiter came and we received our food. While sitting there a group of 3 came in, waited in the doorway for a solid 5 mins.  They weren't acknowledged in any way; no direction on what to do. This was clearly their first time there as well. Another group of 2 comes in slides right by them as they were finally receiving instruction from the waiter and took the last table.  I would have been very irritated but they kindly left quietly and took their business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wanted to take my family to a authentic Mexican restaurant for tacos in downtown Phoenix and came across La Santisima. I like the decor with day of the dead theme (think Disney's Coco) and family like atmosphere. I ordered their Horcata and it is one of the best I ever had (had fruit in the drink as well). Prices are average if ordering tacos individually, I ordered 3 street tacos in a combo and it was under 10 dollars with rice and beans. I tried 3 different flavors and they were equally as good, their Carne Asada taco was on point. Even the plates were unique, like sand-carved style. Overall, the portion size was good, started off with complimentary chips and your choice of salsa from the salsa bar, it was a feel-good plate and experience.  Highly recommend if you visit the Phoenix area.."}
{"text":"We moved to Arizona about 4 months ago and had driven past this place several times, but last night we saw it on an episode of Triple D and decided its time to try it. This place was amazing! Who doesnt love tacos, especially for breakfast/brunch! But they do serve actual breakfast on the weekends too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place would match, if not beat, any taco shop in LA.  Good service and amazing tacos with a complexity of taste.  The Salsa Bar bar is delish and the salsas add a whole new depth of flavor when added to a taco.  

I one star off because the place is pricey for tacos."}
{"text":"Offers a style of authentic Mexican food that varies from the northern regions of Mexico (Sonoran Mexican food) to the food that is found in deeper Mexico like mole, peanut salsa, etc. they have a very good vegan/vegetarian menu. Very authentic and very unique. Great art pieces to look at as well."}
{"text":"Mole' taco was a little bit on the chocolatey side... Cochintia pibIL was not spicy as usual  and Al pAstor was on point.  Salsa bar was great!  Great service!!  Reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Depending on what time you go you might have to wait. But it is absolutely worth it. I got a soup and a burrito. Both were delicious. They also give you chip and they have a selection of salsa choices. My favorite being the chipotle."}
{"text":"For those who are less adventurous I'm telling you to get over the rough look of the neighborhood and go eat!  The food is fresh and excellent every time.  Yummy horchata that my 2 year old loves.  The salsa bar is fun as well. This is our second time and we are already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"The salsa bar alone would make this place phenomenal! Our favs were the Salsa Strawberry and the Salsa Cilantro. My only advise for this place would be to just order one taco al a carte because we had so much chips due to the quality of the salsa we were stuffed. The horchata is home made and the best I've ever had! They top it with cinnamon, pecans, strawberries, & cantaloupe. It sounds weird, but it was very good. They also use extremely fresh, crisp cabbage on their tacos. It was very impressive! My boyfriend had the pork shoulder \"quesa\" which is actually a fried quesadilla and that was also very very very good. We will be back.

My ONLY complaint is that I ordered two different tacos & got two of the same tacos... But it was still very delicious & we will go back to try anything else that sounded good."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely amazing, and the Horchata was delicious!  The only complaint I have is that the service was super mediocre. The waitress never came back to refill our waters, and we would have to waive her down to get a refill on any of our other drinks, and she did not seem to know how to split a check (it took her almost a half an hour to get our checks to us after we told her we were ready).  We were also told that there was no guacamole, only to see a couple seated next to our table (seated after us and ordered after us) served guacamole about 20 minutes after we had ordered.  When we inquired about it, the waitress rudely told us \"oh I guess they made extra there might be a little left\".   Despite the service, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Based on my first visit, I would have happily given La Condesa a 4 star review. My veggie tacos were delicious, and I loved all the fun salsas. I couldn't get enough of them! Really, the only negative was the cramped quarters.

My second visit, however, was not nearly as good. On the positive side, I got guacamole this time which was studded with dried cranberries and tasted great with the strawberry salsa. I was impressed with the service too because my friend's order came out the same time as mine despite the fact that we ordered separately 10 minutes apart. 

The tacos this time were awful. I decided to get the vegan tacos since the description of \"no pintos, no rice\" lead me to believe that the beans and rice in the veggie tacos weren't really vegetarian friendly. I'm a pretty strict vegetarian so I try to avoid food that's been prepared with meat-based stock. The vegan tacos come with black beans which were absolutely flavorless. I'm not sure these beans encountered even a grain of salt during their preparation. The tacos also had iceburg lettuce in them which tasted dreadful of course. 

So now I know I can't have their veggie tacos, and the vegan ones suck. No reason to visit again."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times the quality of the food is so good. The best tacos I have had since moving from LA. The quesadilla I got was so good I ate the whole thing! The asada street taco and mole taco is just the best. The horchata was very good and unique. The salsa bar is good and clean too."}
{"text":"First, the chips and salsa are great with the salsa bar and variety of flavors and heat.  That's where the good goes wrong...

There is something wrong in the restaurant plan: it took over 25 minutes, for example, for the check to be picked up after it was dropped off.  It took way too long for nearly every aspect of the dining experience: water, drinks, food, check.  

We were in no rush, so contrary to some of the pushback on this nearly unanimous criticism, this isn't an entitlement issue.  This is a baseline comparison to other great local restaurants (such as El Comedor Guadalajara or Cocina 10 at Crescent) -- the service here is very poor.  I don't know if it's a structural problem, but it is indeed a problem.

The tables and chairs are too close together even for thin people, which makes it difficult for customers (and STAFF!) to maneuver in the expanded dining room.

This place has potential, but not until some of these baseline issues are addressed."}
{"text":"I'd recommend this place a million times over! I had to knock a star off for the waiting, though. It can be over an hour long at peak times, but the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"Lived up to its rave reviews!  Love vegetarian options and rice and beans were some of the best we've had, so perfect in flavor and texture.  Great vibe, great service and a hell-yeah salsa bar to boot."}
{"text":"My favorite taco shop in all the land! Great tacos, amazing salsa (my favorite are the green salsas, and especially the Salsa Pecan), and great drinks.  I love consistency in a restaurant- I've been coming to Santisima since it was Condesa, and each time, it's the same, great food. I always get the 3 taco plate with rice and beans- their rice is soooooo good! I usually have the Santisima Especial (I hope that's what it's called!) and it is the best! It is a smaller space, I would recommend going in off hours.  I always want to try the horchata, but I'm always way too full! The margaritas are delicious, but pricey and not as strong as they cost.  Mmmmm... Santisima!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend of mine after dress shopping and this is officially one of my best taco spots in town. I've struggled in finding an authentic taco place in Phoenix since I moved from Mexico (ironic, considering the amount of Mexicans living here), but I found it! The salsa bar is my favorite part, but try the shrimp tacos, the gaucho taco and the maya taco, you won't regret it. No sour cream or cheddar cheese non-sense here! Pure authentic Mexican fare (I lived in Mexico for 27 years, I know what I'm talking about!) Make sure you're here early, lunch time is packed, but is totally worth the wait.  Tip: It's easier to park around the corner."}
{"text":"This place was difficult to find because it was night time and I believe their sign is suited more for the daylight. It is a small restaurant with some very authentic details, which were really cool. The door is the old Mexico style (very popular in New Mexico) and the bar is really beautiful carved wood. They restroom in the back have awesome art on them, and the door for the mens bathroom is labeled \"Santos\" with a painting of El Santo on it. (Old time famous Mexican wrestler my father looked up to and actually my Grandfather had the pleasure of wrestling many years ago.) This was very cool for us. 

The food is really REALLY good! I loved my tacos! I tried the Chicken Mole, and mine was some sort of slow roasted pork with a hint of sweet. (I can't remember the name, but it was toward the bottom of the menu.) 

The people were nice, but we waited a very long time for our food. My biggest turn off was that it felt a little TOO authentic when our food came to us on real traditional Mexican pottery style plates. They seemed to be very old terra-cotta with the paint chipping off the rim of mine. I couldn't help but feel that they might not be lead free. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed my food 100% but I think it would be a little better if they upgraded to some ceramic."}
{"text":"Salsa bar is amazing! I had the pork and it was also perfectly cooked! The service was excellent, it was 5 stars all day. I liked this place a lot."}
{"text":"Awesome quaint taco shop with excellent food that has real flavor.  The staff is warm and are a treat!"}
{"text":"Best horchata I've ever had. I crave it weekly. The salsa bar has options for everyone. Only down side is its a very small building so there's always a wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is a great little hole-in-the-wall mexican joint. Overall I'd say while service can be a bit iffy, the food is great and reasonably priced.

Chips and salsa is one of my fave foods, and it's complimentary here. The self-serve salsa bar in the back is extensive, with about 8-12 different salsas at a time. I've been here twice and my favorites are their jicama salsa, pico de gallo, and chipotle. I wish the salsa cups were larger, but that's a minor peeve ... and let's face it, I'm not someone who's ashamed to go up to the salsa bar 5 times. (Given the rate at which I inhale chips, I probably need to fit in some excercise laps to the salsa bar anyway.)

On my most recent visit (around 5:30pm on a Thursday) we ordered standard margaritas. I wasn't super impressed with them (and think they were just made from a mix), but when I got the bill and saw they were only $3 each, I wasn't too upset. They did have a proper drink menu, so next time I'm here I may try one of their other cocktails.

Just as a menu tip for if you're debating between tacos, the \"street tacos\" near the bottom of the menu are smaller (~4\") than the \"gourmet\" ones listed at the top (~5\").  I've gotten both kinds and prefer the smaller street tacos, but maybe I'm just biased toward miniature foods. The first time I visited I also ordered rice and beans, which were better than I've had at most places, though I'm not a huge fan of rice & beans in general.

I love mole and they have mole tacos and other mole dishes which I would LOVE to try, but alas thanks to my nut allergy I can't ... I'll have to live vicariously through my fellow Yelpers' reviews & photos on that one!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, and so much better now that they have expanded. The salsa bar is the highlight!"}
{"text":"About a month ago my daughter and I were looking for a new spot to eat. We stop at La Santisima on Glendale Ave. The service was good, the chips tasted old, but the salsas they 
had at a mini bar were not bad at all. I order street tacos and they were not as good as I was
expecting them to taste. Hardly nothing of cabbage for your 9.00. My daughter ordered a green chile burrito with enchilada sauce. Was not worth the money at all. The sauce was cheese sauce!! Also their was hardly any green chile in the burrito that cost 13.00!!! The only thing we agreed on was the rice it was really good. I have been a Mexican chef close to 22 years and I seem to think that my green chile taste better than this. Step up your game!!! I will not be returning to this place again!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place when our friends moved to the area. We love it! It's small and a little cramped but the people who run the place ( I believe it's family-owned) are always pleasant to us. Being Caucasian, this isn't always the case when we go into other Mexican restaurants. I love El Goucho Burro. The salsa bar is fantastic. I like that they bring you a glass bottle (about a liter) of water at the beginning of the meal. My wife is pregnant so we usually go a little early so we don't have to worry about seating but when normal dinner hours role around the place gets pretty packed. Great food - my mouth is watering as I write this. 

The could probably splurge to fix their front door. It does slam when people go in and out."}
{"text":"Lunch at the bar on Sunday.

Best Salsa: Chipotle and Tomatillo - the traditional ones are the best. I also liked the cabbage and jicama varieties. Peanut, pecan and others were more like dressing than salsa. Pico was tasty too.

Tacos: Chicken Mole was great, sauce was not spicy, but this taco sticks to your ribs.
              Carne Asada - had fatty pieces and chunks. Picked through this one.

Beans/Rice - Did enjoy the beans, free chips and rice wasn't really Mexican, but more white with veggies. 

Horchata - Glorious beverage here. First horchata I had to use a spoon for to get all the fruit and nuts out from the murky cinnamon depths.

Price: Two tacos platter for almost $10. wanted crispy shells, but only corn here. Horchata is 4 bucks so price can be $20 for one person almost."}
{"text":"Their salsa bar is the best I've seen in Phoenix... I love them ALL. The Al Pastor burrito is my favorite... The burritos are HUGE here. I've tried almost every type of taco they have here and they are all great. Be prepared for a LONG wait if you're not going at an off time because they only have a few tables but it is seriously worth the wait. The prices here are unbeatable, too. They only have 2 servers usually who double as bartenders so you have to kind of grab their attention sometimes but like I said, there are only a few tables and it's very small inside so they can always see you."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. We had seen some pretty good reviews on yelp but we were really disappointed. The food was dry and not very enjoyable. The salsa bar was nice because there were a lot of flavors to choose from but even by adding tons of salsa the food was still dry. 

We won't be going here again."}
{"text":"The best horchata and salsa bar ever!! When you come here, you have to try the horchata, unique and oh so tasty. Also, I'm a salsa lover, I love to make it, I love to indulge in it, salsa is my middle name.  So when I come here, its always the best part of the meal. My favorite is the pecan salsa, so creamy and not what you would expect a pecan salsa to taste like.  The burritos are delicious as well and I've had the tacos too, everything is so eye appealing as well as tasty! I wish the restaurant was a bit roomier, but it stays consistent in the number of people coming in and doesn't get overcrowded. I wouldn't recommend to big parties. But overall I love this place and recommend you try it out."}
{"text":"horrible.....
I went to la santisima on a friday after lunch time. it was not crowded but we still had to wait for a table, we got a table and the service was horrible, soda was flat, they sold my husband coke in a bottle and didnt even ask if we wanted fountain soda or that mexican bot
tle soda. taco bar was in Tupper ware and no big deal on flavors, my tacos carne asada was saltyyyy couldn't eat that sh.... husband burrito was salty and full of beans mind full that it was carne asada burrito. I would not go back or recomend to friends. need to get a bigger location and get rid of the dusty xmas tree and junk around it or take time to dust and clean."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant before and was told previously to sit where ever I wanted. So I did the same thing tonight when I arrived. The restaurant is very small to begin with. Maybe 5min after I arrived, a pregnant girl walked by and held up a finger in my direction as if to say \"I'll be with you in just a minute\". After about 15 min, I was finally acknowledged by someone and given some chips. At least 30min after I arrived, I still hadn't been greeted or spoken to by an employee. I counted at least 4 other tables of people who had arrived after me and already had drinks on their tables. One of them even had their food already. Still, no one came by to take my order. I felt like I was on a hidden camera tv show at this point. There appeared to be maybe 3 servers, and the restaurant has maybe 10 tables inside, with a handful outside. It was busy, I understand that, but this experience was ridiculous. I finally gave up and left. It's hard to imagine a business that operates this way being able to survive."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  The real-deal.  Each dish was prepared flawlessly, huge portions and the BEST salsa bar on the planet.  Initially - ordering at the counter was a bit of a turn-off (we almost walked out) but we were very happy we stayed."}
{"text":"First time here.  Liked the atmosphere and decor.  Ordered the La Santisima specialty burrito.   Was very good!   Very tasty and perfectly cooked.  The pecan salsa was also good.  
Now the bad. Was told that they ran out of carne asada.  And it was 5pm on a Friday!   Very unacceptable!   Only like ten different salsas out of the advertised 20.  Family didn't care for the chicken or fish tacos.  Was also kinda on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Almost as good as the original (OK, not sure if this is the original location or Phoenix is but 16th street is original for me). I'm not sure what it is about that location... The food is a tad better, in my opinion, but this location is much closer when I'm at my office. 

Food: I usually get the el pastor burrito... It's delicious. All the tacos are good and I haven't had any complaints on anything from the numerous people I've brought here. I always fill up on chips and salsa because there are SO MANY - my favorites are the cilantro and chipotle salsas and guacamole; tip: mix the chipotle salsa with a spicy one for a kick because it's not at all spicy! 

Service: usually good. The credit card machine was out once... Not a huge issue for us or anyone I saw walk in but would have been disappointed if we didn't have cash.

My only complaint is that they serve the food in baskets and I would prefer plates (I think this is new... I can't remember) but I can work around that if I must... And I haven't asked for a plate, which I could also do"}
{"text":"The place has changed quite a bit since I have reviewed it.  Now there is a bar and a wait staff.  I ordered an horchata, a cochinita pibil taco, a shark taco, a smoked mahi mahi taco, guacamole, and also tried the al pastor taco, and pollo asada taco.  (I didn't order this all on my own.  I had a group of four and we shared.)

The decor is dope and makes you feel like you are about to have a great taco experience.

The horchata is 5/5 hands down the best horchata you will have in your life.  I'm talking nuts, strawberries, cantaloupe, cinnamon, and more.  Devine.

The shark taco is boring.  Not much flavor at all and needs lots of salsa to give it some taste.

The cochinita pibil is 5/5.  Tasty, mouth watering, juicy, flavorful.  Excellent.

The smoked mahi had some nice flavors but was lacking on meat big time.

The guac was average.  They put fruit in it and pomegranates to try to kick it up and be creative but it didn't quite come together.  It needs some more work.

The al pastor was very disappointing.  I am a huge al pastor fan and this was poorly done.  Dry, lacking flavor, very boring.

The pollo asada was exactly the same as the pastor.  Boring and dry.

The beans and rice were above average.  Nice flavor, moist, and good texture.

They also changed out the tortillas and now have dry boring corn rather than the awesome soft ones I had before.  

I stand by my opinion on the salsas as I had on my first experience.  It's cool to have 20 options but only four of them are worth your time.  Two of the reds, and two of the greens.  Sesame salsa?  Peanut salsa?  I tried them all.  No thanks.

It's obvious this place is knocking it out of the park.  It is very trendy, always packed, and holds over a few hundred reviews.  If you go and you probably should. Mark my words.  Order the horchata, two cochinita pibil tacos, and stock up on the traditional salsas."}
{"text":"Second time here. The first time, they had no cold beer for the michelada I ordered, the girl had to come back 3 times before she could get it right with a cold beer. The second time they got our order wrong. Asked for eggs over easy with chorizo, she came with scrambled eggs and chorizo. We sent it back and she brought the same exact thing. They had it on the menu with over easy eggs. However the servers don't understand what over easy means. The food is \"ok\", but when I ordered a street taco it was way over priced for the size and quality. Not recommending or going back here again."}
{"text":"Okay, work meeting got bumped an hour so went to look for lunch with my wife in Glendale. Came across this restaurant  and wow, this is by far the absolute best Mexican food we have found in AZ. Really a great atmosphere and our server is all over it. Bottom line, this is the small little hole in the wall to find. The absolute best I've found. Will definitely be here again, and again."}
{"text":"Definitely best gourmet taco place.  We tried street tacos plate and o.m.g., super good.  Thump up for salsa bar with variety of salsa choices. Some are very interesting combination.  House special horchata, one size only,  but worth to try."}
{"text":"I really like La Condesa.  What stands out is the variety of fresh salsas on their salsa bar, and the great variety of tacos to choose from. I've had the shrimp, and a couple of different versions of their steak tacos.  I've also had the mole chicken, which was great as well.

Service can be a little sketchy here, mostly because they're often very busy.  But if you're in the area, it's a great place to try."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I would give it 4-5 stars, however,  this restaurant is barely concerned with a positive customer experience. 

A decision should be made if this is a full service restaurant or a cash and carry establishment. There is little to no regard for patrons entering the front door. Be prepared to be treated as an afterthought as they either do not have enough staff or are too busy playing multiple roles. It appears that take out orders are the priority.

The salsa bar is great. It also serves as a distraction from the fact the service is slow and food order/delivery is 30 minutes away. Make sure you order drinks, food,etc. all at once. My experience was \"piece ordering\" compounding the wait. 

Overall, I will return for the food.. Take out only"}
{"text":"Visited La Santisima for the 2nd time today.. not impressed.. AT ALL! The place was full, which is fantastic for them, but they could not handle the amount of people in there. They had one waiter who was trying to take orders for all of the table. I won't speak on behalf of anyone else so our experience: it took our food 45 minutes to come out and when it did, my tacos were so dry I could barely swallow it. As the waiter set down our food she asked if everything was OK. After that, we didn't see her until I had to send my food back. My mom and I both had to send our plates back. In the 45 minutes we had to wait for our food, we asked for chip refills.. those took roughly 15 minutes each.. and they charge per basket. When our chips came out, we had little pieces of chips and our basket wasn't even full. The ONLY positive was the salsa bar.. when you had chips to eat it with. 

Bottom line.. not a great experience."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. The taco bar was awesome...we went crazy over it! Special mention for cilantro, pecan, guacamole salsa. Th e main course was also really good. Tried the fish taco and I wasn't dissapointed and hubby was happy wi th his chicken taco. Portions are generous and best part about this place is that they have a lot of options for vegetarians.we will be coming back here for sure :)"}
{"text":"This is the diamond in the rough type mexican food you'd expect out of Phoenix. Fresh tacos. Love the salsa bar. Guacamole is fresh and tasty, almost a little sweet. Give it a try people."}
{"text":"Omg I love this place! They have the best tacos and salsa bar. Oh and the humongous horchata is to die for!"}
{"text":"This unique Taco Shop in Glendale offers a large menu with many vegetarian choices and specialty meats including fillet mingoin and mole! I love fish tacos and this beer battered shrimp taco hit the spot. The salsa bar has many choices the fresh varieties to go with any meal. I have to recommend the horchata it is a huge serving with nuts and fruit and it is worth stopping in just to order a fresh cold nutritious drink! It's easy to pass it by and parking is a little tight however the service is great and it has a full bar!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The carne asada tacos are our favorite.  The salsa bar is the best I have ever had.  Wonderful flavors to add to the tacos, so that we never get tired of the the same flavor.  The home made flan is to die for (different flavors) and so is the chocolate cake when they run out of flan."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing! Our group had tacos and a quesa, with every single item being delicious. We had to wait a short time for a table, but even a long wait is so worth it. We loved their salsa bar too."}
{"text":"I recently went to La Santisma when I saw that their Pacific White Fish taco was on the list of \"Top 100 Dishes to try in Phoenix\". This taco was one of the worat tacos I have ever tried. The fish was covered in a thick beer batter and was so dark and smelled awful. I should have known better when the server said she'd never tried it because \"she's very picky about her fish\". We also tried their Gaucho quesdadilla based on a suggestion from the server. The quesadilla tasted like a deep fried blob of cheese with some pieces of steak.  The strawberry salsa from the salsa bar was the only thing that made the quesadilla palatable. The salsa bar should be labeled by spiciness. There are tons of options, but most of the salsa is so spicy, that you couldn't taste anything else (I imagine that whoever said the fish taco was a \"top 100 dish\" smothered the fish in a salsa that made tasting the actual fish impossible).  The horchata was very good with fresh fruit and nuts, hence the 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Food and service was good. We will definitely eat here again!! The tortilla soup and the tacos were bomb!! You have to order the horchata! We even took one to go!!"}
{"text":"Soooo yummy. Great variety. Come early to avoid the crowds in the small confines. Great salsa selection and the horchata is to die for."}
{"text":"Suggest getting street tacos
Chicken mole
Shark and whitefish Baja style
Pork pibil

Chips and chiles sauces incredible!! 

Partners had the gaucho:: awesome

The mole ........ Food of the Aztecs gods... Yummy"}
{"text":"Short and sweet....AMAZING. Creative taco and salsa combinations but more importantly....BEST HORCHATA IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant..... You had one job to do, in fact it's your only job to cook proper fully cooked meat, and how hard can that possibly be!! Apparently beyond the capabilities of the staff. If I had wanted dried out tasteless chicken with the consistency of a rubber ball I really would have asked. But that's what I got.   anyway, Smokey (my cat) liked it but he's not much of a connoisseur so that's not much of a recommendation."}
{"text":"It was ok. Server was not very keen on anticipating customer needs. I had never been there, and wasn't familiar w the menu or anything. Maybe because I'm Mexican, I wasn't falling over myself about the salsa bar  Horchata was good, although I'd recommend asking for light ice since its 4$ for a 32oz cup, and they throw in nuts and fruit in it also. Finally got  a quesadilla. I basically paid 24 bucks including tip for a soft drink, Horchata, rice and quesadilla. All of which weren't outstanding, service wasn't and since this is my hood, I know that the surroundings aren't worth the price tag either. Recommend you NOT go here and seriously if a salsa bar is where u get ur rocks. Then u obviously don't mind paying for it w the normal tasting food, that is waaaayyy overpriced."}
{"text":"Just as good as the original location.  I recommend the cochinita pibil tacos and a horchata.  The salsas are very tasty.  The place was dead when I came so hopefully more people will come to check it out.  It is a little pricey but it is worth it.

It is much better than La Perla next door.  BLAH.  No idea how that place is still around.  

Check out La Santisima if you are near by."}
{"text":"Yes! Finally made it here and it was DELICIOUS! Queso fundido, tacos (carne asada, mole Oaxaca con pollo, y de puerco) chips y salsa bar, & tloloc burro (nopales, black beans, veggie) was all exceptional! The mango margarita .. perfect! For sure, were returning!"}
{"text":"It was a little hard to find and went past twice!  However, although small, it had nice and a very interesting decor (loved the padded chairs).  The menu was large with very different types of tacos and burros you don't often see.  As mentioned by others,  the salsa bar was excellent with lots of choices with a surprising (and tasty) fruit salsa!  I was slightly put off as we ordered our iced teas at lunch and they were delivered in wax paper cups which was not what you would expect in a sit down restaurant. Then the meal came in baskets like you might get at a Sonic drive-in which was also a little disconcerting.  However, the meal certainly made up for these drawbacks (which in the end is the most important quality!).  We had the lunch plate with a small paper cup of beans and another with rice but believe it or not, I was very full at the conclusion of the meal and even took one of the corn tortilla off one of the tacos as I was 'stuffed'. Overall, I wish they had served on regular plates and regular glasses but the food was excellent. The service was also attentive but not intrusive. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Tremendous food that has only gotten better over time since the restaurant opened a few years back.

The tacos are the best item on the menu, and the quesadillas are a close second, in my opinion.  This is not the typical Az-Mex quesadilla.  It's deep fried and incredibly delicious.  I'd go with anything including arrachera.

The salsa bar is as good as hyped here on Yelp.  My personal favorites are the cilantro, the pecan, the peanut, and the strawberry (when they have it).  A couple of great typical molcajete blends are there too.

Don't miss the house margarita.  The happy hour price of a few bucks is a total steal.  It's a ruby red grapefruit blend, and it's absolutely delicious (and well worth it even at the regular price).

You can eat like a king with a huge helping of food, great salsas, a quesadilla to split, have a margarita, and walk out for $15-20 per person including tip.  Delicious food and one of the best places on Calle 16."}
{"text":"This place is probably paradise for my white/non-hispanic friends! I was born and raised in Mexico, so I know La Santisima is NOT authentic mexican food. But it is tasty food and for a good price. Yes, they have a salsa bar with about 23,594 different salsas (ok, maybe I exaggerated a bit) but only about 2 are pretty tasty. 

I say this restaurant consists more of \"Mexican-American\" food. But if you're hispanic and want to take your non-hispanic buddies to a \"mexican\" place, then La Santisima is the perfect spot where their minds will be blown thinking they're eating \"authentic\" mexican food and at the same time you'll be satisfied too with the tasty Americanized version of a torta or quesadilla. But shhhhh... you know the secret, they don't!"}
{"text":"Wow! I am truly amazed by this place and it is now one of my favorite places. It is small so not recommended for big groups but the food is OUTSTANDING. I had the Pacific white fish tacos with rice and beans Amazing 
My boyfriend and son had the carne Asada style burrito and a rice and beans burrito both said thy were amazing. The guacamole was delish and the horchata was really good. My boyfriend even said it tasted like Christmas lol 
This place is really good and I was very impressed service was good can't wait to come back again"}
{"text":"Super good place with fantastic chicken mole (if they don't run out). The wait and organization of the order/checkout can be obnoxious but it's worth it for the mole and dogfish tacos!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Carne Adovada was awesome. Has a kick and great flavor. Thier salsa bar has a varity of flavors. We'll be back. Also has a full bar."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, once again, this place rocks. Today I had the Quezadilla with Argentine beef and chimichurri sauce, fresh avocados, just to die for!!! I would ditch any overprice mexican restaurant for the oportunity to eat here, they kick butt!!

If you like the gourmet food from Cancun, then you will not be desapointed!!!"}
{"text":"We almost did not enter as the place was empty about 7pm, but I had read about the 16 salsa's and we pushed forward just as one other car pulled into the dimly lit parking lot. The Mexican restaurant next door was packed, so we probably should have went over there. This regional brand of Mexican food might appeal to non-gringos as most of the food was quite unusual and hot and some food was just downright bad. The 1/2 order of guac had large chunks of avocado, but also has raisins and a liquidy kind of taste. It was not what you would expect in a normal Mexican joint. The steak tacos I ordered had to be sent back due to excessive fatty pieces and the chicken tinga tacos were way too spicy for a normal palette. The spicy theme continued as nearly all 16 salsa's had a version of heat that ran too hot. This was a sweaty experience, so gringo's stay away. On a positive note, the pregnant waitress was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Finding someone who can make better mole than I can deserves 4 stars.  My absolute favorite is the chicken mole burrito.  The chickens mole burrito is just that- loaded with lots of shredded chicken, minimal rice in a flour tortilla.  The burros are gigantic and the drinks are gigantic.  I cannot comment on any other items as I am extremely satisfied with the mole and don't venture far from it.  I think you can order chicken mole tacos but I am unsure.  The salsa bar is tasty, too.  

Apparently there is a Happy Hour on weekdays.  I noticed Tequila behind the bar but didn't see any beer and am unaware of what the Happy Hour entails."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness.  I realize that I just reviewed this little-slice-of-Heaven last week, but our latest visit deserves an update.  

We brought my visiting mother-in-law to La Condesa, so we could share the Mexican-food love with her.  For the last two days, I've heard her on the phone to at least 3 different people, raving about the \"amazing\" Mexican food she had on Saturday.  

On this visit, they had the Carne Asada (they were out last time).  My husband liked it, but actually thought the Tinga chicken was even better.  He swears there isn't a better chicken taco in town, and I think I'd have to agree.  My MIL had the chicken mole tacos and loved them.  She orders mole whenever she gets the chance, and rated it way up with Barrio's dish.  I was blown away by the deliciousness of the mahi-mahi burro.  Oh, goodness... I'm having a flashback of it's amazingness...  luscious chunks of fish, smokey bacon, mushrooms (which I normally pass on, but they were fantastic!), and their velvety cilantro-cream sauce.  Ahhhhh.... so good!  

Another 5-star visit!"}
{"text":"Love this place but the service sucks. I sat for 7 mins and did get any service. No water, just chips. They ran out of the cups for salsa and I just sat there. What a joke. I asked if I could place my order, the waiter just said yea, then walked away. So I continued to sit there. After what seemed to be 5 more minutes I just gave up. I left. What a shame too, I used to like this place. They need a better wait staff. Fail."}
{"text":"O... M.. G... This place is out of this world amazing! So many types of salsa.. The chile verde burrito I had was ridiculously yummy!! The reviews are pretty accurate here."}
{"text":"My favorite place for tacos in all Phoenix! Try any meat or vegetarian \"La Condesa style\"... . Everything is fresh and tasty... Service is also friendly and quick...i highly recommend it if you have visitors from out of town."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place!!! One of the best taco places I have ever been to. Everything is delicious there. I would go there weekly if it was closer to where I lived. I recommend everyone stop by, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food. Loved my tacos. Salsa was great. Alot to choose from...

Great michelada.  Service and decor is weak"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! Seriously, they're some of the best I've had anywhere the valley. They don't slop a mountain of cheese on them or drown them in sauce like some other Mexican food joints. Just flavourful filings with a small amount of garnish; simple and delicious.

Rice and beans are OK. Skip the rice and beans and just order 3 or 4 tacos. Space is very small and seating can be an issue but the food comes out pretty fast."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for La Condesa yet.  I have never been disappointed here.  Ever.  

Here is the deal:  

-you start with a side of chips.  And then you get to feast on the humongous salsa bar.  My favorites are the pecan (creamy, thick, and with a kick at the end), cilantro (thinner but delicious), and the tamarindo (sweet and spicy).  Sadly, the tamarindo one seems to be quite elusive and is not always available.  You could spend hours trying all the different salsas.  I agree though with Iain, the peanut was the weak link.

-next comes the real food.  I have only had the tacos, but I imagine everything to be of the same quality.  So these tacos come with double tortillas to hold all the ingredients.  These aren't skimpy by any means.  Two should be sufficient for most people.  The Cabo Shrimp is amazing.  Huge shrimp beer battered with a creamy sauce on top.  The chicken mole taco was also great with that special chocolately flavor to it.  Today, I tried to Mayan Cochinita taco and it was stuffed to the brim with tender as can be pork.  I have had the rice and beans before with a combo and I would say the beans are better than the rice.  Though in my opinion after four or so visits, it's best to come enjoy the chips and salsa and then indulge in two tacos.

This place is really hard to find, but if you find Palm and McDowell, it's right there with a few parking spots along the street.

If you like tacos, you need to come here.  It's just that simple."}
{"text":"This place used to be so delicious. We loved the tacos and the salsa selection back in 2012-13. It's so not the same now. Service was disappointing. Food was bland. The horchata was still yummy, but our server never came back so we couldn't order another. The 4 ice cubes in my water melted and our tortillas went cold and still nobody came to check on us. The salsas were still good, but there wasn't  any jicama salsa. The tortillas were like Guerrero brand I think. Def not made in-house. I'm sad that I will never go back again."}
{"text":"\"Oh wow, what did I get myself into?\" was all I thought as I pulled up to La Condesa.  I'm not familiar with Phoenix or the surrounding neighborhoods, so I was a little taken aback at first.  The business looks like an old house, as most of the businesses in the area do, i noticed lots of bars on the windows, and the majority of the business signs in the area were in Spanish.  THE ONLY reason I noticed this is because I'm unfamiliar with Phoenix and was traveling alone.

First impression, the restaurant is tiny! I would say that at capacity, the restaurant is pretty loud and I had a difficult time hearing my server. The tables were very close together, all the chairs were mismatched, and the lighting was really dim.  It was very difficult to get to the back of the restaurant where they put the salsa bar.  

The house margaritas were made with fresh grapefruit and lime, and that was perfect for me. Unfortunately, the food wasn't as good.  I had the shrimp burro, and it was really sloppy.  It melted out of the sleeve and fell apart while I was trying to eat it.  Plus, some of the tails were left on the shrimp... let me tell you about shocking!

The service was sub-par, in my opinion.  My server was inattentive and didn't ask how my food was.  I had to flag down the server like an air traffic controller in order to get my bill, and it took a while to get my bill back.  

This one is not a revisit for me."}
{"text":"Always a line out of the door but the service is quick. Great tacos but you could head somewhere else for far less time. They have a salsa bar and good margaritas."}
{"text":"The self serve salsa had a great variety and was a lot of fun. The margaritas weren't amazing, but the food certainly was. I enjoyed a few street tacos, but particularly enjoyed the refried beans. I was visiting Phoenix, but it is definitely the best Mexican food I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about La Santisima. Best Margarita I've ever had! Get the house (Santisima) Margarita.Tacos and Quesas are beyond delicious. Everyone I've taken there has fallen in love with it too."}
{"text":"Love the food. Wife and I visit her ever so often and I've tried a few different dishes. This place is not your run of the mill regular meat, cheese, tortilla and red sauce Mexican cuisine. Plenty of seafood and veggie items. The salsa bar alone is something to visit for as there are so many delicious items."}
{"text":"What is there to say about La Condesa? It's simply amazing. 

I'll admit, we found this place searching for more of a day-to-day, less expensive version of Barrio Cafe. We found that and more. In our one month since we've moved to Phoenix, we've eaten here three times. By far the best item we've had is the fried quesadilla with mole chicken. Oh, and the horchata. Best. Horchata. Ever. It's not your typical horchata, so watch out. Mole poblano tacos are also heaven, as is the cochinita pibil. Salsa bar is to die for. 

I love the hole in the wall vibe. Only bad moment was that I got trapped in the bathroom, but that was my fault. I swear the door opens out, not in. This place is super casual. Plastic cups and nothing fancy, but the vibe is uber awesome. It is very small, and seating can be limited, but it always seems to work out. I don't recommend this place for very large groups. 

We'll be back, about once a week."}
{"text":"I was hungry for tacos so I went onto Yelp and found this hidden gem! I've lived here my entire life and never heard of this place! Wow... best tacos in the west valley! Definitely go here if you are craving an authentic flavorful taco - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and has been for years. There are more salsas in the salsa bar than I've seen anywhere else, more types of tacos (and they're all great), and a special house horchata with granola and fresh fruit that I've never had anywhere else."}
{"text":"HOLY SH*T this place is good. Shark Taco plus peanut salsa is great. I love this place, will be better once they add more seating. May check out the Glendale location if their is more room even though I live all the way in Chandler."}
{"text":"Best al pastor street tacos in the U.S. I visit Mexico City 5 times a year and this is the only place that come close to a real street taco. The gourmet ones are good for gringos but not this gringo. Try the Jamaica and horchata waters. Don't forget about there happy hour deals. The service is mostly bad, they have one good server, but the food is worth it. Come with an open mind and don't come if your used to be pampered."}
{"text":"It was okay, I'm not sure if it was the style, but the beef was chewy and the shrimp seemed overcooked as well. Horchata is definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"As many close to me know, I hold Carolina's in very high regards as it is cheap and delicious and I have claimed many a time that it is my all-time favorite. However, until I tried La Condesa, I had no idea what the hell I was talking about. La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop has surpassed Carolina's - nay - EVERY restaurant I have ever known. I write to you with a mind blown and blurry with recent memories of an unreal salsa bar and horchata topped with pecans, melon, strawberries, and cinnamon...  I can die happy."}
{"text":"The wife and I were visiting from Georgia. Saw great Yelp reviews for this restaurant. Food was fantastic wife had the the margarita that won many awards it was the best margarita we ever had. We had excellent guacamole as well as tacos first time I ever had a filet mignon Taco it was outstanding. Would highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Wow!  This spot is legit!  Just went their on Father's day and was blown away!  The salsa bar is killer, some many tasty varieties.  The quesadilla is what won me over and is worth the trip alone.  The street tacos are very tasty.  If you are a Mexican fan this is a must go."}
{"text":"This place is small but totally worth it. Guac has mangos in it which just makes its all the more amazing."}
{"text":"This place is just like a trip to Mexico City. 
The food it's good, the atmosphere here is great the music it's a little too loud but hey for lunch time it's just perfect, no one wants to think about work at that time. 
What can I said it's just a great place!"}
{"text":"As you read this review, please keep in mind I am a conservative mother of two small children.

This place is so effing good.

Since moving to Phoenix two months ago, I have been in search of a down and dirty taco place, but one that didn't leave me feeling like I had just eaten a corn tortilla full of grease. This is that place. Authentic Mexican food with a gourmet twist. So so yummy.

I ordered the el gaucho steak taco and the cabo shrimp taco. Add in a $2 Negra Modelo, and life was good. If we didn't have two kids in tow, my husband and I could have kept ordering tacos and beer. 

Be prepared to go early, and the place is small...so seating is limited. Not good for large groups. 

Such a great place. If you aren't happy with your order here, then that just might be a personal problem. And I can't help you with that."}
{"text":"We got there for an early dinner.  Place didn't look that busy when we arrived.  They took about five minutes to great and another five to sit us.  I was not impressed by the way place look.  Floors were dirty with food.  But then I saw waiter cleaning tabla and dumping crumbs on floor.   After we sat down waiter left and didn't come back to take our drink order for a long time.  We almost got up and left because of how long they took to take our orders.  We had the al Pastor mahi fish and mole tacos.  They were super good!! I also had a michelada and it was delicious!! Food wise I give them Five stars.  But service and cleanliness I give them two stars.  
Next time I'll give the one in Glendale a chance. Hoping food is as good as here but with better service and a more clean environment."}
{"text":"Today we had a meal par excellence at Condesa!  My sister and Mom raved about the restaurant and I was excited to go.  I noticed some of the prior reviews had so-so service but my experience was very good. Our party of 5 was seated promptly and chips and drinks brought out pretty quick. The salsas were great but I liked the pecan salsa the best. My wife had chicken mole tacos which were tasty and even the beans have that authentic mex taste that is hard to find. Quesadillas were interesting and almost pastry-like in presentation, I had the Argentine beef w
Chimichurri sauce and it was awesome. A overall great experience and we shall return. Oh and margaritas were NOT from crappy sweet mix. Fresh lime juice and authentic!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience ordered a Vegan Salad and was given a salad with meat. Customer service is horrible"}
{"text":"Their salsa bar is very inventive, and tasty.  Food is excellent too.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"My favorite taco place in Phoenix! Some people complain about the prices but I'm from the east coast where the prices are similar and the tacos aren't even on the same planet as these.

You can definitely get buy with three tacos, four if you're super hungry like I always am and feast in all the deliciousness! The salsa bar is fantastic here as well as the guacamole. 

Ignore the fact that they've been on Food Network and have gotten a bit more touristy; the food is still legit and isn't that all that matters? So stop by, have a margarita and chow down on some delicious tacos."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurant experiences I ever had. It was a party for my taste buds....literally. Their tacos were the highlight of my meal. Especially the chicken mole and shrimp tacos.

I live in New York area and I plan to come here again just to taste their food."}
{"text":"Love love love this place..... I am in town with my fam vacating for a week... MY husband found this place in yelp. When arriving, didn't know what to think of it... From outside doesn't look that much of a restaurant and going inside it is too small of a space. Only 2 servers working 12 tables... 

I had Gaucho Burro, it was more than enough.. Perfect portion. And I recommend trying the horchata too. 

Authentic Mexican food!! Tasty food, and nice servers. Simply this place is officially my favorite new place..."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that have lots of potential but are not managed well. My boyfriend's dad was in town and he wanted to have some authentic Mexican food and since we were starving we ended up coming to La Santísima since the reviews seemed good and it was closed to where we were.  When we got there the place was fairly busy, they only had 4 chairs in he waiting And my first impression of the place was not great. There was water spilled in the floor and food crumbs all over the place. Anyways, there were several people standing waiting to be acknowledged. When the host finally came she didn't greet us and we had to ask her if she wanted to take our name. We waited about 10 minutes for a table and then were seated in a booth. 

The room where we were seated was decorated very nicely with paintings of \"La Santisima Muerte\" but none of the lights in the roof were working, so they had a light in the corner of the room that was very bright and poorly placed. We then met our waiter who was very nice but quiet (It seemed like he has whispering the whole time), we asked for a drink menu and guacamole and sadly we were told they didn't have any Guac. Anyways, at this point we were just \"meh\" about the place and we just ordered our food. I had carne asada tacos, my boyfriend had a mole burrito and his dad had a burrito as well. They brought our food and I had to ask for utensils since there were none at the table. My tacos were tasty, the beans and rice were well cooked and delicious. I asked for a lime (since I'm Mexican and I can't really eat my tacos without lime) and I never got it :( so I stole my boyfriend's lime from the margarita he ordered (without a drink menu by the way cause he was never given one) we finished our food, we payed and left.



Pros:
Food seemed authentic and tasty.
The artwork in the place is beautiful.
The salsa bar is great.


Cons: 
Poor customer service 
The place looks like it needs better maintenance 
NO GUAC?! 


Customer advice:

This place has great potential. I think that if they had more waiters the customer service would improve since everything seems quite disorganized. 
-Greet your clients when they come in.
-Clean the floors constantly. 
-Fix the lighting.
-Go to the store and buy some Avocados for God's sake.
-Have utensils at the table. 
-Expand your waiting area.


Honestly, I'm a little bummed cause the food was good but I don't think I'll come back to this place."}
{"text":"The Chicken Mole tacos are phenomenal
The salsa bar is the best I've ever had.  By far.
La Condesa is a must try.....then you will be back...
- M"}
{"text":"Love the concept upgrade Mexican food with authentic flavor, I am not a big fan of beans but the black beans here are delicious!! I have tried the taco platter and also went for brunch and had chilaquiles super good as well."}
{"text":"Best street tacos. Salsa Bar is full of variety. I could tell everything was fresh. My New Mexican spot for sure"}
{"text":"Incredible!  It's not too often a native Arizonan, raised on mexican fare, finds a new mexican restaurant this good.  I'd put it up against any, in CA, AZ or TX.  Their Quesadillas are the best!  And we really enjoyed the salsa bar - wow!  That's a lot of different kinds of salsas!  We're definitely coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Man we had 3 moms and 3 kids and 3 babies for lunch! The place was packed so we waited about 45 minutes for a table. The food was good and the staff did the best they could to walk around us! Thank you for understanding!"}
{"text":"He estado en este restaurant algunas veces, pero queria ir con alguien de Mexico, y tener su opinion y  a ella le gusto mucho. Si estas  en Phoenix y quieres comida Mexicana este es el mejor lugar al que puedes ir."}
{"text":"You would miss this place if you drive by it in a random small strip mall on the side of 16th st, but the muerte that is so beautifully decorated outside will catch you! My first trip to La Condesa was great, the music is very authentic, almost like Latino pop. But the FOOD- lets talk about it... First you get chips and you wonder, where is the salsa lady?! But then you realize that amazing salsa bar at the back of the restaurant is where you get to pick out your salsa! My favorite was the strawberry salsa it was so unique, I've never had something like that before- and it was fresh fresh fresh! Then there's other usual salsas and more fun ones, probably about 12 or 14 to choose from and lots of lemons and limes.

I had the tinga chicken tacos and they were very spicy, but I like spicy! But if you don't like spicy do not order them, they have an after burn and don't require salsa. The amount of chicken on the two taco plate was amazing for $6.99! 

TIPS-

Try the strawberry salsa
$2.00 Modelo Sat&Sun
Happy hour M to F 3 to 6 looks great"}
{"text":"Margaritas are amazing!

Tacos on point. Baja shrimp a must. 

Gourmet tacos are your thing it place is a must in Phoenix"}
{"text":"The bomb! Huge selection of Sala on the salsa bar, fresh and cool. Some really different and imaginative. The pork was almost like a BBQ, delish The margaritas were delicious and very tasty! I will be back"}
{"text":"Omg this is my new favorite taco place in Phoenix. There is a wait during lunch so call in your order or be prepared to stand in line. The horchata is also amazing. I got a lot of different tacos but couldn't decide on a favorite. They also offer other foods as well. We went for a business lunch which was great. Atmosphere was nice, not too loud. The cheese dip appetizer is really good."}
{"text":"A truly great casual and authentic Mexican restaurant with a gourmet twist. La Santisima sports great artwork on the interior. They have a salsa bar with a wide variety of interesting flavors. The food is delicious, unique and interesting. Less traditional, but flavorful and satisfying. So are the portions."}
{"text":"Good food keeps us coming back but overall services is not good and definitely not friendly. The hostess was absolutely horrible, not one smile and made us feel like we were inconveniencing her! One bright spot was the bartender that took our drink order well we waited for a table. The restaurant was enlarged recently but still a long wait and tons of open tables well we waited so either the kitchen or service wasn't ready for the larger space. Not sure how much longer we will keep going back if the service doesn't improve!"}
{"text":"There's a reason they have so many reviews. I've been here multiple times and my favorite thing is \"la santisima veggie taco\" so good! My husband gets the \"traditional quesa\" and that is also delicious. Not to mention their music is fitting and fun ;) I'm definitely a foodie and 99% of the time I look at reviews before eating somewhere, sometimes I go back to places & sometimes I do not. But La Santisima has a special little place in my heart. If you're looking for a fun, colorful, comfortable place with super good food this is a must."}
{"text":"La Condesa is in a rather unassuming location in Phoenix.  But has a nice atmosphere when you get inside.  The first thing I noticed was their huge salsa bar.  We sat down and were brought menus and chips.  I tried most of their salsas.  They all had their own very unique flavor.  the peanut salsa was really interesting.  My favorite was their tomatillo salsa.  

I ordered the Oaxaca Mole taco and a carne asada taco.  The mole was excellent with great flavor.  The carne asada was bland and flavorless...huh?  I dumped salsa on the carne asada taco and when finished was rather disappointed in that particular offering.

Also ordered their calabacitas.  They were seasoned well and tasted great.  

I had a bite of my partner's pork taco and it was amazing.  

I am glad we found La Condesa and I will definitely visit again to try some more of their menu offerings."}
{"text":"Phoenix has so many great destinations for Mexican food, but I have to say, La Santisima is amazing and authentic.  The salsa bar is stunning with as many as 12 varieties from which to choose.  The promptness of service at the lunch hour could be improved, but it is a small spot with limited seating.  About to go there for the third time...I think I'm hooked."}
{"text":"While my friends and I were in Phoenix and in search of a lunch place, we found this place on diners, drive-ins and dives. We came here on a Tuesday and arrived a little after it opened. You order at the counter and then find a seat. 

We ordered an assortment of tacos. A unique option that they offer is to order a protein taco. Instead of the tortilla, it was replaced with an egg. It was delicious, but filled us up quickly. If you go this route, consider ordering a taco or two less than you normally would. Not sure how many eggs they use per taco but it's probably between 1 and 2. I don't think this extra protein option widely advertised. My friend found this option somewhere on the menu, and we didn't know about it until he received his order. We were perplexed by what he ordered because he was the one who was enthusiast about tacos, and it didn't look anything like a traditional taco. Great option if you would like to go with the no carb option. I've never seen this at any other Mexican restaurant before. 

Our favorites were the Sonoran carne Asada taco and the shrimp tacos! They also offer a salsa bar and complimentary chips while you wait for your food. Fast service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The only downfalls would be the parking situation and the service is freaking SLOW. We came on a Saturday a little before 5:30 pm and a 10 minute wait. We ordered 2 margaritas as soon as we sat down and didn't get them until maybe 30 minutes later after flagging our waitress down. Pretty sure she forgot, but still c*mon. They were pretty dang good too. I love the complimentary salsa bar and the variety of flavors! Salsas definitely can make or break the meal and you have so many to choose from! The chips were fresh and tasty. 1st basket is complimentary but I think like $3 for more as it states on the menu. The fried fish taco was fabulous, light and crispy! The refried beans were creamy and smooth. Rice was simple, so it was a refreshing change from other restaurants. The whole dining experience  took 2 hours! So it's definitely a place you need to go to when you have the time to spend. We had time to look at the menu and decide what we were getting before we sat down, so we weren't taking our sweet time or anything.  The line was out the door at 6 pm and the service is on the slower side, do be ready for the wait. However, I was impressed with the food and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment here. The rice was Day and the chicken tocos we're not tasty at all. You also have to get your own salsa. I would totally pass and go to another place close by."}
{"text":"Oh where to start. So often places are over rated, but not the case here. We've been many times. This is probably my favorite Mexican food in Phoenix. My reasons for this statement? 1) best burrito I've ever eaten (I only wish I could recall the name; it was a special I think). I've had many of the tacos from fish to shrimp to beef to shark and all are good. 2) salsa bar. So many choices! All delicious. Seriously see the pics this is not your average salsa bar. 3) Quesadillas- a unique take on this dish that seriously takes it to the next level. You will not regret ordering any of these! Tip: Come in early or late to beat the rush. The space is small and can fill up quickly. Service is typically good."}
{"text":"This is the second time my family has eaten here! It's a GREAT hole in the wall restaurant! The tacos were AMAZING!!  My husband had the burrito and said the pork was incredible!! We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent small restaurant.  They have great vegan options and huge salsa bar providing a wide range of flavors.  We will come back here in an instant."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos!!! The salsa bar is like nothing I've had at any other taco place. There were so many to choose from and each got better. The portions are huge and the staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Fiance and I went on a week night to come out this restaurant for wedding rehearsal dinner.  We were seated and given chips.  Was a relatively busy night. Only one waiter appeared to be working. Lady from behind the bar came and gave us water after 10 minutes.  Waited almost 20 minutes before walking out without ever having our order taken. Two other couples came in and their orders were taken right away. Very poor service for a nice looking place."}
{"text":"The mole tacos were disappointing after all the wonderful reviews of them. They were very sweet. Don't get the rice or beans. The teaspoonful they give you spreads out from being watered down. The salsas are good. The waitress seems like she must be the entitled child of the owner. Also, I think I'd also rather eat off of a paper plate than the questionably leaded & chipped Mexican plates. 

Guy Fiery must have been drunk or hungover. Also they surely knew he was arriving so the place must've been cleaned that day. I have seen cleaner food trucks than this."}
{"text":"Was driving by this restaurant and saw loads of cars so I figured it must be good and it was. The horchata was the best I've ever had (and I lived in Austin and ordered it frequently). It had a spoonful of sweetened strawberries in the bottom and loads of cinnamon on the top. Yum!  The chips were basic, but the salsa bar was a great surprise with some very unusual offerings (e.g. a creamy cilantro salsa, a pecan salsa, a jicama salsa). The burro was loaded w rice and chicken mole. The mole sauce was rich and complex, but I wish there had been more in the burro. As a final note, at lunch, you order at the counter and the line can be slow. So don't find a table and peruse the menu (like I did) or you might look up and find that the short line is now VERY long!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at what i found after walking through the doors. Yum. I underestimated the 2 taco plate size and got two additional street tacos (happy hour 3-6 m-f), leaving me stuffed.  The fried shark was great - awesome crunch with perfect texture while not being fishy. I've had better mole but it's worth the try if you've never had it. Carne asada and cochinita were also good.  Experiment with the different salsas to make each bite different.  This place is not cheap for tacos but def worth the groupon when available.  Good luck parking in front if it's busy."}
{"text":"Hot food hot. Cold food cold. Yep, delicious. Horchata was full of delicious fruit and nuts. The place was very clean. Sat at the bar and saw the food come thru the little window. No rush, no fuss, just cranking out quality grub. Salsa bar would take a couple of trips to truly savor, lots of choices."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch and it was both of our first times. When I arrived, I parked next door at a mexican party shop. I am not sure if I was supposed to park there or not. Luckily I didn't get towed. Parking is not so fantastic there and you have to drive slowly down the street so you don't miss it. The restaurant is in a non-descriptive block. 
When I walked in, I loved the big wood chairs and tables. The feel was authentic mexican inside. We grew up going to Mexico every family vacation and my parents always liked to go to the non-touristy spots, especially in Cancun downtown. This restaurant reminded me of the Yucatan-inspired restaurant we visited that was right next to the bull fighting arena. So did some of the items on the menu. There was a mini bar for the salsas, and I think they had about 6 out. I wish they put a name card out for them so you knew what they were. I decided to grab a few different ones and see which I liked best. None of them were outstanding, but I did enjoy the unique, but hot strawberry salsa. I  decided to try a corn quesadilla off the menu, looking forward to real mexican queso in my meal. I ordered the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Quesa. It had Oaxaca cheese, roasted pork shoulder with achiote rojo and Mexican herbs. It was delicious, though, it was so filling, I could only eat half.  I was unhappy about the tortilla chips.  They tasted old and stale. I figured they'd be fresh and hot from the fryer since I got there right when they opened. 
I need to go back again so I can really get a feel for more of the food and atmosphere. I think this is a review-in progress situation..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food at this restaurant! It was very authentic, delicious, and the menu had an abundance of vegan/vegetarian options. I would eat here if I lived in Phoenix! However the seating is pretty limited for bigger parties and the hostess is not very accommodating."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but they expanded and apparently the kitchen can't keep up. I tried to call in an order but the phone just rang continuously. So I went to the restaurant to place my order to go and was informed their phone isn't working. I said I wanted to place a to go order and the guy points to the kitchen and says \"see all those tickets up there (there were maybe 7) it's going to be a 45 minute wait for a to-go order.\" I worked in the food service industry. That is horrible customer service. He then told me I could place my order online through Yelp ($10 delivery fee). I was planning on ordering a mole bowl with a side of beans. All of those items are already prepared and take less than 5 minutes to put together. I took my business elsewhere. Learn how to speak to your customers."}
{"text":"They weren't kidding when they said they had an extensive salsa bar!! I tried most of them and they own had their own distinctive flavor and it made my burrito great!! 

Ok so this spot is in a sketchy part of phoenix. That's the first thing I noticed when I got off the freeway. Transients mostly around BUT I've learned that the best food spots come from restaurants that are in places you wouldn't think to go. Hence the term HIDDEN GEM.

It's SUPER small here. Luckily it wasn't too busy. But it's literally a small box of a restaurant. It looks like it can hold up to 25 people safely. 

I ordered a carne asada burrito, chicken taco and one of the houses popular burritos. I can't remember the name of it but it was delicious!! My burrito had lettuce, tomatoes and their own house sauce. It was so delicious! My burrito is on steroids!! It was so big too!! You have to come try this spot out if your near Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Walk in and the waiter insisted on the wait being over 45 min and that we had to wait outside. Then we where seated but the same waiter gave us attitude and very poor customer service waited over 15 minutes for a server to come up to us to ask for our order but we weren't ready and the serve never came back after waiting serval minutes ( 20 minutes) paid for our drink and left very disappointed at the service we where looking forward to trying it for the first time it was very upsetting the way we where treated so poorly."}
{"text":"So myself and a coworker passed by this joint and loved the outside decor for the sign. Yelped it, and bamb! A whoppin 4stars huh, so today we stopped by to try it. 

Let's just start off with the entrance to the place. Line to the door. No tables open. One cashier, during the lovely lunch hour. 

The tables weren't bussed yet so we sat at a dirty table till it was cleaned. Can't blame them as the line never stopped from growing and to go orders were huge as people walked out. 

Food arrived and then the taste buds had an awakening. I tried the Cabo Shrimp taco, Mayan Cochinita Pibil taco, and Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Shark Taco. All are very delicious just as is. Did not need the salsa bar they have but tried them for the chips the give while you wait. 

Only downside to the joint is the tortilla. The tacos seemed like they served them on some you get at Frys and or even a knock off, definitely nothing gourmet or authentic about those. 

Overall spent $16 on three tacos priced 3.99 each and a drink. Will I return??? Probably not, maybe to try others from the menu. But not worth the 4/5 stars!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are delicious!! They have a great salsa bar also. It's not a huge place, so  just be aware of that in terms of time, they aren't in a hurry but def take care of you. Very flavorful food!"}
{"text":"Excellent mole! The home made horchata with fruit & pecans. Great place to take out of towers for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"La Santisima is not an ordinary taco shop like a hole-in-the-wall Mex restaurant. This restaurant offers vegetarian dishes on the menu. This time around, I tried the cauliflower taco, its a bit dry. But with an amazing selection of salsa and it a sure thing to make dining enjoyable. I tried the salsa La Mexicana it was  a good compliment with the taco. The variety of style and uniqueness of the food is a sure five stars!"}
{"text":"I grew up in a Mexican household so I tend to be super picky about eating at Mexican restaurants. I can't stand generic places like On The Boarder and Mi Amigos. 

It was around 8:00 pm on a Wednesday when I showed up. It was super busy but we were seated within ten minutes. The servers were attentive throughout the night. :D

That said: I love the idea of a salsa bar but I wasn't a fan of all of them. Personal taste.

Their food was awesome! It didn't need the salsas at all. I ordered three different gourmet tacos with beans and rice. All of them unique and on point.

Plus, I ended up with a food coma. Enough said."}
{"text":"Pros
Great salsas at the all you can eat salsa bar! Loved the guacamole salsa and the peanut salsa. Good tacos and horchata!

Cons
The guacamole is not that great. Avocado was minimal and not worth 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Hands down, best tacos in town.  The salsa bar is the bomb!"}
{"text":"What can I say that other reviewers haven't? This place is awesome for vegetarians (there are like 8 different vegetarian taco choices!) and the salsa bar is awesome (strawberry salsa!). I really liked the guacamole, which was chunky and light with refreshing chunks of jicama and tomato with the avocado."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Wife had the shrimp - I had the Cochinita. Both effing delicious and reasonably-priced. And after reading some reviews, I'm really excited to go back tomorrow and try their horchata. The chips were a little salty for my liking, but the salsas we tried (especially the watermelon) were great. Cool art on the walls.

Seriously - La Condesa is the real deal."}
{"text":"Love the idea of a salsa bar.  The three I had  were all good.   The Norteno burrito with red chillies, beans and pork was best burrito I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"The food was great. Huge servings. But sadly the service was not good. Maybe a few more waitresses would help?"}
{"text":"This place seems to be universally loved in Phoenix. It makes sense because the food is excellent. Every person I was with raved about the food afterwards. The salsa bar was also great. Lots of flavors to pick from and most were just the right amount of spicy. 

You really can't go wrong on the menu here. The burros (get them enchilada style) and the fried quesadillas are probably the most popular things and I'd recommend either of them. 

The reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because the service was extremely underwhelming. They were clearly understaffed (which seems to be a common theme for this restaurant), but it was extremely difficult to get hold of our waitress and we waiting close to 50 minutes for our food."}
{"text":"Nice place very small but great food.  However it is always packed so you may have to wait a bit to get a seat.  But it is packed for a reason"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp we decided to try this place. I can't figure out how this place has 699 reviews and an average of 4.5 stars?? I am not sure what the hype is about!! Simply because Guy Fieri graced this place with his presence; I love him as much as the next person but that doesn't make this place entitled to 4.5 stars. Everyone else who rates it 1 or 2 stars nails it!! The atmosphere is down right disturbing, a twilight zone experience! I kept thinking the entire time \"How does this place have 4.5 stars and 699 reviews?\" \"How?\" \"I just don't get it?\" \"Please explain, somebody explain it!!\" 
Service: They have the approach of we have an outstanding reputation and you can take it or leave it attitude. 
Food: The salsa bar is unique in that there are a variety of combinations, some strange, peanut, some good, pecan, most have a good kick! But the salsa cups are so small you can barely dip your chip! I got the cheese quesadilla, just not my idea of good, at all! Looked beautiful but too much cheese and I LOVE cheese; cheese is one of my top two favorite foods! That should say a lot! I ordered a side of beans and rice and the beans were really good! That is why I gave two stars for the beans and beans alone!!! 
Atmosphere: The tables are not level, extremely dirty, the chairs are upholstered and covered in stains and filth! I am not hard to please, I'd be up for a good hole in the wall joint, as long as you felt like it was clean and they cared about you being there! But this place is just down right weird! I love the other girl that said this place is schizophrenic! Pure craziness!"}
{"text":"the food is good, the service is not good sometimes. in fact sometimes the service kind of ruins the experience when i eat in so i always order to go. and even when i order to go i must wait 30 minutes for my food, even at times when they are not too busy. i have tried multiple times to call in my order ahead of time so i dont waste my time with this restaurant, but many times their phone just keeps ringing and they never answer it. funny tho, because when you walk up to the counter, there is their phone right next to the most encountered area of the restaurant. when i have the patience to put up with the lack of decent service here, i come and enjoy some good food."}
{"text":"I went here at about 11:15 today for lunch. There was a line. that had already formed. Its a very small venue, no bathroom, so make sure to wash your hands and do your business before you get there. Only about a dozen or so tables on the floor, and the cashier is also your waitress delivering food to your table. If your expecting great service, forget about it, you focus strictly on the food here. Their is barely any parking. Everyone that seemed to come in was new to this place checking out other patrons food and asking them what it is and how they like it. Im sure they were all fellow yelpers as well considering where this place is and how everyone appeared to be new to this place.

The address is a little confusing with the map being shown on their website. Its off 16th street as the address implies, and the crossroad is Palm and 16th. There is a sign for another business there that says FAT PAD which is easily visible. Blink and you will miss this restaurant. The inside has a lot of cool mexican art. They also have a fresh salsa bar.

Wow this has some very flavorful food. Its not greasy or fatty at all. You can really taste all the ingrediants. I ordered the Dog Fish Tacos, the mahi mahi burrito, and the Carne Asada Taco. Everything was absolutely delish with lots of flavor! I liked the Dog Fish taco best. 

Make sure to get there before noon. They do take a while to make it, so be sure you have the time, especially if they are busy. You can call ahead or fax your order in as well."}
{"text":"La Condesa not only has two of my favorite tacos The Baja Sur Shark Taco, and The Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Taco but the hole in the wall feeling you can't get a chain place. 

The seating is community style with large tables and smaller ones. It's a little tight space wise but it works for the style of the restaurant. Prices are reasonable, food quality is great, and they have one of the best if not the best salsa bars I've ever experienced. There's also a full bar for those that drink.

This place is awesome and I love that I can support local business while getting my grub on!"}
{"text":"Sauces are great! Guac has cranberries in it but so good! I got the steak, shark and pork taco. All were good but the pork was my favorite.  Horchata was good! Chicken Quesadilla was something I never seen before but lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Specialty burrito was amazing. Veggies were still crisp, marinated chicken was tasty and rice was great. All wrapped up in a light nicely toasted tortilla. 
The salsa bar was phenomenal!
Quaint atmosphere - I don't live in Phoenix, but I will be sure to eat here when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I was incredibly impressed with the food. So much so that I probably will be back. Unfortunately the service. The waitress was the only one, so I was forgiving when it took her a while to take our drink order. At least the bus boy had given us water. By the time she came around we were ready to order as well. It didn't take too long before our order was out but it was missing a few things. My boyfriend had asked for his burrito enchilada style and it was not. He was also missing the rice he ordered. Since we had never been there before I ordered 4 different tacos to see which one I liked the most. Our waitress only brought 3. We told her our issues and she went to fix them right away. I was almost done before my boyfriend's burrito came back with sauce. When she finally brought the 4th taco it was the wrong one. By then I gave up and just took what she had given me. I was just super disappointed that the service didn't match the food. Hopefully next time will be better."}
{"text":"What a surprise! Not only do they have strawberry salsa, which made my toes curl, their mole burro was fantastic. It's very different from the mole we get in Los Angeles, richer, more of a heady chocolate flavor with a hint of sweetness.

Delicious.

The tortilla soup was also quite yummy and their salsa selection was outstanding."}
{"text":"Parking is horrible.  There were two groups ahead of us . Plenty of tables open waiting  to  be cleaned.  It took about 20 minutes to get seated. There is a salsa bar  but several were almost out. Guacamole  was entering. Quite different we did like it. Our meal did take  about 30 minutes.  Their was no napkins or silver were. The tacos were good . We did like rice and beans. Service again was a little slow"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! No matter what you order everything is always fresh but my favorite is their salsa bar they've got a wide variety that is sure to satisfy anyones palate. Also the art on the walls is awesome!"}
{"text":"A-freeeeeaking-mazing!!!! Everything's sooooooooo good!!! Seriously authentic and flavorful!!! Mix the pecan salsa with the chipotle salsa - it's bomb!"}
{"text":"Place is hella bomb ... so good can say nothing bad about this spot ... good tacos , rice , beans and beer what can you say . Service was on point today ."}
{"text":"This place is blowin' up on Yelp and for good reason!  I have a strong desire to knock one star off every review I have for other Mexican spots after eating here.  The salsa bar is fantastic, and with so many choices (upwards around 10!) it was really hard to stick with four or five little cups.

I decided to go kind of random with my taco selections and picked the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco and the Cochinita Pibil - marinated pork.  I seriously think the Cochinita Pibil was the best taco I've ever had, at least north of the border anyway.  The Dogfish Shark taco was very good as well.

I think my search for the best tacos in Phoenix has come to a close!  It's going to be really tough to justify going to another place after this experience."}
{"text":"La Santisima has an excellent selection of salsas. The food and especially the various burritos, are unique and taste excellent!"}
{"text":"Service sucks. Took over an hour for my 3 tacos and my friends burrito to arrive on a Thursday night with only 4 other tables of small parties who also looked like they had been waiting awhile. But food is good. Just not an hour wait good."}
{"text":"Wow. I was in Tempe for 4 days - aside from hitting up the usual faves like In-N-Out since I made the mistake of living in a state that doesn't have one, this was my other highlight.

Space is limited, but going early (i.e. 4:30 pm on a Sat) seemed to beat the rush, we left past 5pm and it still wasn't packed yet, but did hear it fills up quickly.

My only complaint was that I wish I had a bigger stomach to try all the different tacos. The friend that took me said they never has ordered off the first page (Taco Page) because its so good, and now I can see why. 

Tip: Once you get your table, make your way straight to the salsa bar and start filling up your little cups. They'll bring chips to your table ASAP.  Don't waste time sitting there waiting for your server, go get your salsa! 

Also, I'm not a huge Horchata fan, but the Horchata there was super tasty. It's also 32oz, so share, or go pee a lot."}
{"text":"I went to this location as I was driving down 16st saw it out the corner of my eye and I'm glad that I made the stop, it was kinda packed but my party only waited about ten minutes. I ordered the gaucho taco that was recommended by our waiter that was one of the best tacos I had ever had and trust me I've had tons of tacos and don't even get me started about the shrimp tacos they have"}
{"text":"In a single word this place is... AWESOME!

We were up in Phoenix on Wednesday afternoon and stumble upon this little gem right at the end of happy hour. Their happy hour tacos are delicious, especially the tinga tacos. SO GOOD.

Helping ourselves to the fresh salsa bar was a blast. There are so many unique and yummy flavors up there. I think we tried 12 different salsa and absolutely loved four of them. (Not to say that we didn't like the other flavors.) 

We then went on to order the the shark, the mahi mahi, the mole and the pibil pork shoulder tacos. I can't say enough about these. The mole was tasty and rich. The pibil pork shoulder was sooooo good. The meat in that one had so much flavor and was just perfect. The shark taco was more like a shark taco with a LARGE side of more delicious shark. Seriously, too much shark for one taco. (Not that such a thing is a bad thing!) The mahi mahi taco was more like a scrumptious mahi mahi pizza. The portions for these tacos are more than enough to keep get you full by the end of the night!

I really liked every little taste that this place offered up. Why isn't this a five star review? Honestly, the service isn't the greatest. It isn't bad service, it just isn't five star service. Seriously, I would over look this little point time and time again if I lived close to this place. The food is AWESOME. Seriously. Check this place out and you will leave full and happy!"}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious Mexican food! Plenty of veggie options and absolutely yum. Would love to come here again. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent quality! This may be the very best food for the value one can get in the valley!  The carne asada was incredible and seldom do I eat the beans and rice, but they were both amazing too!  Very good - I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go here after seeing an episode of Check Please! Arizona but my high hopes were quickly dashed. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon (around 4ish) and found several couples waiting to be seated and were told that there was a 20 minute wait for 2, which was odd as there were several empty tables. The AC was not working and it was over 100 degrees outside which made the wait even worse. I was pleased with the Grapefruit margarita while we waited but then my hopes were dashed again as our waitress was very...forgetful? Ditzy? Lost? The menu was enormous and too confusing, the salsa was all very spicy (some people who enjoy Mexican food do not like super spicy), and the service was just pitiful. We waited 20 minutes to order, and then another 20 for a beer. The food was good, but overall it just was not worth everything we had to go through. I was looking forward to trying the Flan and having a nice, cool horchata for dessert only to find myself being disappointed again because they were out of flan and the horchata tasted like watered down milk. Needless to say I will not be coming back here again. My advice: if you have a few hours to kill: try going on a weekday in the middle of the day and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Don't blink because you can easily miss this place when you drive by! It is certainly not the place to go if you are looking wear a shirt and tie (but who wants that?).  Very vibrant spuper casual atmosphere.  They have a salsa bar that has so many choices, I was pretty full just trying them all.  I personally liked the strawberry salsa...it was sweet AND spicy.  Had a couple of regular margaritas...be careful, they sneak up on you but were tasty and went very well with the various salsas.  When we first walked in and were waiting (very small waiting area) they gave us some type of orange margarita which reminded me of something you would expect on the beach somewhere.  It was good but I like the traditional ones.  My guest and I both had the fried quesadilla (one pork and one beef)...WONDERFUL!  I recommend this place if you are in the area.  I am not sure I would drive down from the North valley specifically for La Santisima but it is reasonably close to work so I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the salsa bar !!! Basically this is the hole in the wall that was featured on food network diner dives and drive ins. We had to wait in a sketchy neighborhood for 30 min so was it worth it?

I would say yes since i haven't had too many good Mexican salsa bars. This one had about 10 salsas one was even strawberry !

The smoked marlin bowl was delicious as well as the beef steak tacos."}
{"text":"Stopped in to have dinner for my brothers birthday.  Our party was a bit too large for the small dinning area, there was 8 in our group.  However, after a short wait they were able to accommodate us.  

Everything I tasted was great, the only thing holding me back from giving a five star review is the small dining area.  I had two tacos and rice and beans.  The cochinita pibil taco was very good but the star of the show was the Aztec tinga.  So flavorful, so fat, so hot!  Man, good thing I had a horchata to cool the flames.  The horchata was very good but around halfway through it became nearly impossible to drink through the straw because of the fruit and nuts.  It was no big deal though.  All in all it was a great meal at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos and burritos in Phoenix! Convenient location, but be prepared to wait at busier times and be a little creative about parking. It's hard to miss the giant sign/sculpture on the building, and the restaurant has a great character."}
{"text":"always crowded, which leads to slow service, but the food is awesome.  The salsas are quite interesting and I try a new one every time."}
{"text":"Wow lots of choices for Salsa at their Salsa bar. Food was very well done-good flavor and decor is really fun here!"}
{"text":"yes another review of awesome accolades to a great taco shop. With all my repeat visits I thought I had written a review on this awesome taco shop. Apparently not. So, this is why I'm a fan of La Condesa... it's simply their beer battered dogfish shark tacos!!! they are soooooooooooooo good, it's like beachside fish tacos without the freaking beach, the taste, smells, and overall experience eating these totally delicious fish tacos can give you a mindf*** yes it's that good! and dipping them these beauties into my favorite salsa of all time.... confetti machine razzle dazzle... the salsa cilantro! it's soooooooo good so creamy, so perfect with their fish taco, and afterwards enjoying their horchata with fruit and cinnamon on top.... HEAVEN! love their quesas, the fish taco, La Condesa you have a fan!"}
{"text":"I have heard so many great things about this place (It was on Diner's Drive-Ins & Dives!) and we finally decided to get our taco-loving booties over there to try it! Ohhh my goodness, I am so happy that we did!! 

They have the most amazing fresh salsa bar with at least 10 different salsas made daily. Being a sauce lover, this was a complete dream come true. I recommend getting the two taco plate with rice and beans. I got the Aztec Tinga Taco (Shredded Chicken, Tomato, Onion & Aztec chipotle sauce) and it was SO juicy with the perfect combination of spices. I also got a Carne Asada taco that was delish! The restaurant is small and I hear it gets busy so I would recommend dining here during off days/times. We went on a Thursday night at 7:30 PM and it was perfect!!! We will for sure be back, i've been daydreaming of their fabulous salsa bar ever since we left!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the best burrito I've ever had. Not to be drama-lama but I think of it often. LONG and LOVINGLY. 4real. I had the Sonora Carne Asada Burro (definitely not the most adventurous but the most classic). It was HUGE and honey I ate it all. Full of tastiness. 

Small intimate restaurant kind of off the beaten path. My friend took me here and she loves the tacos. Next time I'm back I'll have to try them- but my burrito was so good I will probably just get it again.

Salsas GALORE at the salsa bar. I'm a woman who loves options and boy do they have salsa/sauce options! 

Service was good. No complaints."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of tacos and great salsa's... the restaurant itself it very tiny though! When its busy good luck finding a seat. You can always carry out."}
{"text":"My rating is based on experiences from previous visits to the sister establishment on 16th St.  The service and quality do not hold up here.  I hate to be so blunt but that is the way it has to be.  I have watched people walk out due to lack of service.  Watched a father and son dine without silverware!  THEY DID IT.  Will they be back???  Watched my uncle clean a dirty table that had been sitting dirty long before we had decided to sit outside and just before we had decided to leave.  All in the same day.

The food has been really good here, but they definitely have some growing to do.  We have come to love La Santisima's and would have no problem going back to the 16th St. location.  Get it together."}
{"text":"I ordered La Condesa shrimp burrito and it was delicious. The salsa bar was okay at best, the salsa was similar in flavors despite their various options and it felt like it wasn't fresh. The service was terrible and slow. It took an hour to get my food and my waiter only spoke to us when I ordered my food and to drop it off. I had to get out of my chair and look for my server to get the check. Not impressed with this place. Will not be going back."}

{"text":"Have to eat here when I'm in Phoenix. Delicious, especially the salsa bar. I went back so many times, that I told the waiter just to bring me a soup bowl and a spoon. Who knew my favorite was the radish salsa? Not me.  The quesadillas are like none other: made with fresh corn masa, kind of puffy, and loaded with your choice of filling.  La Santisimima, mi corazon, I'll see you in November."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I have had in AZ. Only thing I would love for them to do is give bigger bowls for your salsa in case you really want to dunk a chip but I still managed anyway! Amazing drinks! I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"OMG, we had NO idea this place was so freaking tiny!  Had to wait outside no more than 10-15 minutes on an early Saturday evening (many more people were waiting when we left).  Didn't have anyone at our table for quite some time (he apologized and we noticed they don't have a large staff at all).  HOWEVER...

The food was EXCELLENT!  The house special tacos, my husband's Mayan pork tacos, the rice was flavorful, the MANY salsas at the salsa bar were great, the horchata was bliss, and the bill was pretty darn spot on!  We will return....just during an off time OR via a delivery service!"}
{"text":"I visit my family here in Phoenix at least twice a year for the past 12 years.  All the food here in the Phoenix area so far has been mediocre to say the least.  Till I ate here, the carne asada is on point and the alpastor is very good.   I also tried the veggie quesadilla which was out of this world.  The salsa selection is so good that I would have gave it more than 5 stars just because of the great assortments of salsas they have."}
{"text":"I know most people just love this place...I can't get into it...tried it a few times...always a stuffy vibe with a staff that stopped caring who showed up a long time ago. Great tacos are a dime a dozen in Phoenix...if you want to experience a better vibe w/o wondering why you are sitting on top of the table next to you there are several other great options."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Margaritas BLAH!!! Definitely will go for food and then venture somewhere else for cocktails!!"}
{"text":"My co-worker walked in from lunch the other day with their horchata and I liked the bit I had so much I demanded to know where it was from. It took a bit for me to get used to the sheer number of salsas they had available, but once I got comfortable trying things (I was afraid I might burn my tongue off accidentally) I was hooked! 

I'd recommend the peanut salsa to anyone. It was some seriously good sauce."}
{"text":"Delicioso! 

This is a neighborhood hole in the wall that serves some pretty great mole. I am a mole fiend. Love the stuff. Can't get enough. Their's is dark, rich, spicy, and the right amount of sweet. (Also how I like my men, hey-o). 

(Just kidding.) 

Also, who doesn't love a salsa bar? I've never even heard of most of them: pecan salsa? peanut salsa? Um, why are you only giving me 4 lids for the to-go cups? Like I'm not going to try them all ..."}
{"text":"I was very glad to stop here. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options. You can truly eat at your heart's content. 

I came with the wife and we both ordered the 3 taco platter. I got mine vegetarian, she got fish tacos. While the tacos were being made, we got some salsas from the salsa bar. This is a very nice feature, we tried a few and I really liked the tomatillo salsa and the jalapeño salsa. Then the tacos arrived, and they were pretty good, accompanied with rice and beans. This is not a typical Mexican restaurant, it is what they call Tex-Mex cuisine, but good nonetheless.

We also had margaritas, agua de jamaica and calabazitas (eggplant)."}
{"text":"Not quite sure about the hype...we stopped in on a Sunday evening and did not have a great experience. They had good foot traffic and we were seated within 10 minutes or so. That's when it went downhill... 

We received stale chips, the salsas were just ok, and the service was very slow. After one hour and 15 minutes, we still had not received our dinners. We finally asked them to pack ours to go because we needed to leave. 

The business is very aware their service is slow. Apparently they expanded their dining room but not the kitchen.

When we finally got to eat, the food was just ok. Maybe it would be better when fresh."}
{"text":"At first I thought I was in a nursery, every table in these cramped quarters had an infant (with strollers and baby seats) crying and whining. I hate our society now that this is acceptable behavior of bringing your crying baby to restaurants ...how about taking that kid outside for a stroll like a responsible adult than totally ignore them and put us through this stressful situation (you're just waiting for me to snap RIGHT?) 
Well back to the review...
Food was fresh, unique, authentic. Plus, Plus, Plus. Salsa's were plenty, yes tried them all. But I'm a foodie and I need flavor, though I thought it's a bit on the bland side for my taste, I'll instead rave about them being unique and not your 'ordinary' mex-restaurant. The night we went, there was a line and busy, and they do treat you as family/friends (another Plus) but maybe too crowded. We had the center table and everyone, servers and patrons jammed right in there. 
I ordered up the Sonora Carne Asada Burrito (it says: A char-broiled mesquite Arrachera steak with homemade beans) unsure what Arrachera Steak is but gobbled it up with extra salsa from the buffet. Jodi had the Fish Tacos and well... they smelled fishy. Not the best either one of us ever had ...but was now check off our bucket list. Mission complete"}
{"text":"Love love love.  Favorite thing on the menu is the gaucho burro - it's so good I don't waiver from that.  The salsa bar is an obvious plus too."}
{"text":"So good.  I've eaten lunch here a few times and always go back to their veg taco.  So yummy."}
{"text":"The guacamole is incredible-- big avocado chunks, cilantro, onion, tomato, mango, dried cranberries.... amazing. And the El Pastor Burro our recommendation. Great place for fresh Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I don't tout many restaurants especially Mexican food but La Condesa is by far one of the best taco shop restaurants I have been to in the valley. 

It is hard to believe that with almost a Mexican restaurant on every corner in Phoenix that most if them if not all of them are disappointing or overpriced.

If you want a Scottsdale vibe with overpriced drinks and unauthentic food then this is not the place for you but if you want home flavor cooking with fresh ingredients with an authentic smile, then don't miss trying out this great new hot spot. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The salsa game is strong. Do not go to this shop if you are in a hurry quality takes a little time.
All of their margaritas are $5 all day Tuesday. There house margarita is one of the best margaritas I have ever had."}
{"text":"My wife and I waited over 2 minutes when we walked in and no one even acknowledged us even though a waiter walked by us. We had to grab her on her way back to ask to be seated as she didn't seem to want to even acknowledge our presence. The place was maybe 60% full, so it wasn't busy by any means. After a while, she came back and said it'd be at least 5 min before they could seat us as they had to bus a table. While waiting, another couple came in behind us, was helped immediately and was told the same table would be available soon for them. The waiters were chatting away and a couple of them were even flipping through their phones. For being behind, there was no sense of urgency from any of the staff to catch up. We left as there were way too many warning signs that it'd be very poor service for our meal. I shouldn't have ignored the other reviews that said the service was going downhill--don't make the same mistake."}
{"text":"Well, as this place is 4.5 stars after 144 reviews, it's not like I am going to share anything that will ruin the secrecy of this place and just how great it is!

I had plans to bring one friend here who is Dia De Los Muertos obsessed.  She blew me off, but I was so looking forward to it, I talked two other friends into joining me to check out a new spot.

The gal is a jamiaca fiend, and was thrilled with the drink.  Having read reviews on the size of the horchata, I convinced the guy to share one with me, we could always get another if we needed it.  (We didn't)  WOW - no other horchata will ever measure up!

Yes, the salsa bar ROCKED!  We sampled 6 or 7 of them.  I could live off the jicama, cilantro, jalepeno and lime tastiness!  And the hot red one that looked greasy had the most amazing heat/flavor ratio I could imagine ever encountering.  Truly, the acme salsa!

Being indecisive, I went a la carte with the tacos.  One each of the cochinita pibil, one chicken mole and one carne asada.
I was busy having a foodgasm with the cochinita when the gal freaked on her carne asada, making the guy have some - and they both agreed it is better than America's Taco Shop!  (Mine had to sit and wait while I was having quality alone time with the last bites of the pork.)

I will say I wasn't thrilled with the mole.  This is NOT a knock on how La Condesa does it - and if you're a mole fan, it may be amazing.  I'd never actually had mole - turns out I am just not a fan of the overall flavor.  But I love almost all Mexican food, and I love chocolate!  How is this possible!  Two rights making a wrong?  Weird!

That said...I will be back.  Over and over!  This is definitely on the short list of places to have a quick, great meal in my hood!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The cochinita pubil and chicken mole tacos were unforgettable and the salsa bar alone is worth the trip.  The salsa cilantro was a great choice.  I'll be telling all my friends about my new favorite taco stop"}
{"text":"Eh. Food was very average and service was pretty bad- we were shortchanged and forgotten about for a solid amount of time. Got 3 tacos and a burrito. Burrito was mostly rice and the taco meat was very dry except for the fish. Overall a very overhyped place. If you're looking for tacos Mucha Lucha is 1000x better."}
{"text":"What took me so long to get to La Santisima?  Not much to add to the myriad of great reviews about this place other than to say Yelpers are dead on with this one.  The food, drinks, atmosphere, and staff all make this place a valley favorite for good reason.  Tonight my brother and his wife took me here as a late birthday present.  They've been here dozens of times and love it.  So I was confident what I was about to get would be pretty money.  And it was.

Let me first confirm what so many are saying about a specific drink here.  The Horchata.  Yes, its enormous and yes its awesome.  Has a nice light texture with accents of cinnamon and nuts.  The salsa bar here is also as extensive as advertised.  My brother and sister grabbed cups of each and every salsa for me to try (which was hilarious to watch since they were carrying full handfuls of salsa cups).  My favorite salsas were probably their cilantro and tomatillo.  As for the main course, its a taco shop first and foremost so I went the taco route.  The two that Yelp suggested most were the Mayan Cochinita and Cabo Shrimp.  Outstanding choices.  The cochinita pork was out of this world tender and delicious.  And the cabo shrimp was delicious and the portion on the taco was VERY generous (I could barely hold it on the tortilla).  The other thing that stood out to me was the rice on the side.  Seriously.  This isn't your run of the mill rice.  It's got a creamy savory thing going on.  Not sure exactly what they put in there (though I did pick up on some corn notes), but that rice is good stuff.  We didn't do dessert this time, but I'm sure I'll give that a try next time I'm here.

The service we received was super friendly and on point.  The place is small with seating for no more than 20 and it was pretty busy on a Saturday night.  So on most nights you might have to wait just a bit for a table.  Parking here is also pretty scarce so keep that in mind.  Its quintessentially traditional and delivers a wonderfully tasty experience.  I'll be back regularly and that horchata will likely accompany each of those visits."}
{"text":"Walked into a small crammed room with dingy white walls and Day of the Dead themed wall decor. The place seemed to be in disarray as a regular. Food was basically $10 and up. Quesadilla is good, was like a mexican calzone type thing. All in all, not worth going there. Guy Fieri did them a solid giving them more credit than they deserved. Food was tasty, but perhaps the customer service, seating and cleanliness can be better?"}
{"text":"There's a reason this place was on the TV show Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. The al pastor fried quesadilla was amazing, and there is a salsa bar with many options which you can serve yourself. The quesadillas are not typical, see attached photo. There aren't that many seats, so you may experience a wait at busy times. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely horrible. The waiter barely spoke to us. I felt like I had to beg him to do anything. No one asked if we wanted water.. Had to flag the guy down. Then I made the mistake of ordering more chips and had to ask several times for the waiter to bring them out. When he finally did he looked annoyed w me. He never asked us how our food was. The final straw was when it came time to pay, I told him we were paying separate and then he let out this long sigh that included his lips flapping loud as if I asked him to do the hardest thing in the world. I didn't want to leave a tip.. Because that's how bad it was.. But ultimately I couldn't do that. I just won't come back. I didn't feel welcome in the first place."}
{"text":"For starters, let's just start off by saying yummy!
The cuisine was absolutely melt in your mouth good. I had the taco platter with al pastor and carne asada tacos, so crazy good. Great staff,  Great restaurant, and amazing food! So very highly impressed! Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I love the salsa bar.  They have so many types of salsa.  Small and can get crowded but worth it."}
{"text":"Adore this taco joint! They have a huge selection and great service. Try the shark tacos!! A very authentic feel, with a salsa bar in the corner. This is a smaller place, without a waiting area so we had to wait 15 minutes outside before being seated. This in no way detracted from how great the food was, but if you go at a busy time, just be prepared."}
{"text":"Great mexican food.  Favorite part was the salsa bar"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been coming for years and they don't loose the touch. Love the array of salsas everything from traditional pico to strawberry salsa and definitely my favorite is the \"jicama\" Obviously the food is amazing. Love the shark tacos, the gaucho and the fillet mignon burro being my favorite. For sure you'll have to try their guacamole. It's so tasty and refreshing with diced mango it will surly stimulate your taste buds. All in all my favorite places to go for gourmet Mexican food."}
{"text":"It's good and all if you're into the new infused Mexican style food, my mom ordered the tacos en chile enogada and it was a little too sweet for her, my quesa de cochinita pivil was flavorful so that was a plus. I guess it depends on what you order it's a hot or miss. The service was not all that great, the tables were messy. Not worth the money, a salsitas or Federico's would be better. 

Save your money"}
{"text":"went here because I was excited at their vegan reviews of how great their tacos were. When I got here I had no idea how popular this place actually was. There was a 30 minute waiting period, but I expected long wait since we came at 6pm. We wanted to try out their guacamole, but they were already sold out? that kinda saddened me lol.. especially since they ran out of the best salsa in the first 20 mins of us sitting down (least spicy and most flavor). I tried many other ones but none compared. They never bothered to fill it back up either which I didnt understand, but maybe since it was later at night they thought that would be pointless. they were also very busy the whole staff is always running around catering to everyone which I actually loved. The people who work there, work their asses off. I could tell. Plus none of them were rude at all, which is always a great thing because most restaurants dont treat everyone the same. The food was great I cant complain too much. Definitely recommend this for meat eaters though. It caters to vegans with a large selection of options unlike most restaurants, but not the healthiest if you are a real vegan. Corn tortillas aren't exactly healthy, and I have had better fried cauliflower. If you came here with family that wasn't vegan Id say you are safe here for everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS. The food outstanding and the salsa is on point. But there is only one server every time I come. It takes 20 mintues for my order to be taken and another 30 mintues until my food arrives. By then my drink is usually long gone. Please get more servers!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, which is key. Horchata is off the hook!!!!!!! Plus it's been on DDD's. Worth yo time!"}
{"text":"With all the great places to get tacos in Phoenix -La Santisima is a must visit. Be prepared to fight for limited street parking or save yourself a headache and park in the neighborhood behind the restaurant. This former hole in the wall, now full blown restaurant offers a wide selection of gourmet and street tacos. Their salsa bar is first class and will please every taste. Customer service is a bit slow ( I guess due to the high demand?!) the meals are always hot and correct! The ambience along with the diverse food flavors makes you feel just like in Mexico."}
{"text":"Great place for tacos and every kind of salsa you can think of. Must try the horchata and michelada. Glad they expanded the location on 16th st."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food with amazing salsa bar. They doubled the size of the restaurant this year."}
{"text":"my friends convinced me to give this place another chance. 

the salsa bar is SO good. I don't really recall what I ordered to eat but i do remember not loving it. it was decent though. 

the salsa on the other hand is amazing! salsa all day long!"}
{"text":"I was going to meet a friend for lunch at Barrio (one of the only places you can get \"real\" Mexican in Phoenix, which I could never understand -  we are less than 4 hours from the border!!). Unfortunately, it was before I yelped much, so I neglected to notice that they were closed Mondays:( Dejected, we drove down the street looking for someplace else to go. I can't remember if it was the Catrina that drove us in, but as soon as I saw the salsa bar, I knew I was in heaven. It was like actual food that I've actually eaten in Mexico (rather than assorted patterns of tortillas, rice, beans, and cheese). Now we take all visiting friends and family to this place. A visitor from LA said they were the best tacos he had ever eaten and I'm sure he wasn't lying. 

Many people have commented on the salsa bar. My favorites are the creamy ones (pecan, peanut, and cilantro) and most of all the sesame (to me, the spiciest one on the bar), and usually I try to sample some of each one - but taste is in the eye of the beholder. The important point is that you don't want to fill up on the chips, because you will be sad when your huge plate of food comes. So I'd like to share my strategies for maximizing the salsa enjoying experience without getting uncomfortably full.  I start by limiting myself to 5-6 chips which I break into smaller pieces for dipping. Once the food comes, I take the second tortilla from each of my veggie tacos (the tacos themselves already have just the perfect type and amount, so it's pointless to try and add more) and use it to scoop up the salsa. With only the one remaining tortilla, you do get some drippage, but you can add more salsa to any veggies and cheese that fall out and eat it with a spoon. Then for dessert, I pour the cilantro salsa on my rice. Mmmm, salsa. I would buy this stuff by the tub if they would let me. BTW, I asked - they just laughed. 

The only draw back is that my poor husband tries to order a margarita every time we go, and they still don't have any. I hope someday they will take his advice and add it to the menu."}
{"text":"This place is tiny and often packed. Great salsa bar, my favorite is the cilantro and 7 chiles.  If you like texture, you have to try one of the quesas.  Its a type of quesadilla/empanada/tamale.  Made of a corn masa, it is filled with cheese and other ingredients, folded over and pinched closed.  Then it is deep fried.  My favorite is the shrimp.  

They do have a full - but tiny- bar.  

I've been here at least a dozen times an d always love it.  ALWAYS."}
{"text":"I have to say my experience today was an extreme disappointment.  And it had nothing to do with the food. Unfortunately the service was so bad. It was like pulling nails to get someone to take our order. And to get a refill on my water took entirely too long. 

But even worse was the smell of sewage in the back dining room. As soon as we walked in I smelled it. I don't know if there is a leak or what's going on back there, but it was very distracting and made eating there very difficult for me. I thought it was coming from the women's bathroom since it's RIGHT THERE (gross) but it turned out to be coming from the back storage room that opened up into the dining room. 

Again food was great, ad my Blue Demon Margarita was sensational."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  We ordered 4 different kinds of tacos and all were simply superb.  You must hit the salsa bar in the back wow there are some great creations back there.  We must have made 5 trips.  Service is super friendly and fun.  Margaritas not bad.  Come for the food the decor is fun but overall not over impressive. When back in Phoenix I'll be back soooo good!"}
{"text":"This is a cool little place to try. I think the best thing on the menu are the quesadillas. They are traditional Mexico City style which are not in the flour tortilla as most places serve but are maid out flour ( I think they are from Mexico City because we were brought up eating them this way). They are deep fried which is worth trying just because of how deliciously amazing they are! There salsa bar is unique with lots of choices, but I do wish they had at least one spicy one. I think their service can improve, ( maybe our server was just having a bad day). But overall good place."}
{"text":"Have driven by this place daily for years. Finally stopped to try them and I'm so angry at myself for waiting so long. Very impressive menu but I just stuck with the 3 Taco mix & match plate for my first visit. I will have to say the flavor in these tacos were the best I've ever had. I have been craving them ever since I've tried them. The salsa bar is beyond flavorful. Probably the widest variety I have seen. The artwork and atmosphere is very welcoming. This is definitely a MUST TRY place. Lunch rush can be busy, but that's a good sign!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! The seating and parking can be a little dicey, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered the green chili chilequilles with poached eggs and a margarita with a corona. The food was awesome and the drink was superb but what really impacted our first time experience was the wait. It took about 5-10 min to get water but she did bring our chips out first. They have small plastic to go cups for salsa which is an inconvenience to keep going back and forth for refills, not to mention half of the sauces were bland, (had no flavor). 

At this point we ate two baskets of chips and still didn't get our drinks we ordered from the bar. Our food actually came our first then finally my margarita and two mechiladas came. We ate half our food as the chips filled us up from waiting so long. The food was delicious but the service needs immediate attention.

Another issue I had was that the ladies room had no hand soap so I decided to let the staff now. Shouldn't they check this prior to opening? It's unsanitary if the staff goes to the restroom and touches food. 

All in all, I'd give it one more try but I'd go if I'm not in a hurry to go anywhere. If you are on a short lunch break, don't come here unless you're ok with showing real late to work. Hopefully I can leave a better review next time I visit. Great food, bad service when it comes to timing. Otherwise our server was nice.... btw there was only a couple dining and three girls. They place wasn't packed so I shouldn't have waiting about 25-39 minutes for my drinks and food (-_-)"}
{"text":"Arrived here for lunch off peak (2:00) and the place showed signs of being super busy, and was a wee bit dirty.  There was only us and another party and they did start catching up on the bussing while we were eating. First off, BEST Mexican I've had in a long time. Anywhere. The guac is something special and different.  See the photo. The pork shoulder and steak w/chimichurri sauce were amazing, even the simple rice side was great. I did like the steak taco better than the pork but the favors were very different.  The salsabar was a real treat!  So many things to try. Will be back next time in town."}
{"text":"This is authentic and delicious food. I am so happy we found it! The food possesses layers of flavor and I cannot wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Just passing through Phoenix and stopped by this place for lunch, I can honestly say my meal was very good. Great flavor and reasonably priced; with even better service. Would definitely go back and recommend to others. Tried all the salsas didn't think any were really spicy, I had the burrito and it was delicious."}
{"text":"It's been almost 11 hours and darn it if I'm not still thinking about that mahimahi burrito. So fresh. So tasty with the various salsas. So awesome that it's just down the street and I can come here whenever I want and spend WAY too much time choosing the salsas I think would best compliment my meal. It just don't get much better than La Condesa, and that's coming from me, and me has a pretty serious taco/burrito issue, as in I always want them and I always want them."}
{"text":"The salsa bar with complementary chips is a blast.  Not truly complementary as the food and drinks are not cheap for a taco shop.  Husband had the pork with banana leaf, rice and beans on side.   He left the rice alone (too full). His burro was excellent with a good flavor to the slow roasted pork.  I got the chicken burro with moles sauce.  It was not great, no taste of nuts or orange.  I took the flour tortillas off and mixed the chicken with a little salsa.  Still not great.  Five stars because my husband's pork was good and the salsa bar was really fun. Place was really busy.  Will come back to try something else."}
{"text":"I have to admit that it is a great restaurant. Its service attitude is not only very friendly,the taste of food is also very delicious. The environment is so clean that I have a warm feeling. I recommend you go but DON'T be too late because it might take you some time to line up."}
{"text":"Love the vegan tacos and all the variety of salsas offered.  But the service leaves much to be desired.  We have been waiting for our tacos for over 30 minutes and its not even full. Its way past the lunch rush so we are not sure why it is so slow... w are about to get up and leave..."}
{"text":"The day we went it was so hot inside the building you could literally see sweat on people's faces. It took 15 minutes to get someone to ask what we wanted to drink. And then it took 10 more minutes to get our food order in. Overall service was slow and the heat made us all so hot we didn't want to stay. But the food was good, just had to take it to go cause it was just so hot inside."}
{"text":"If there is anything I'd miss if I were to leave Phoenix, it would have to be the Mexican food.  That's what we're good for (and to think we're trying to get rid of the Mexicans!).  There's awesome greasy hole-in-the-wall, everybody-speaks-Spanish places like El Tlacoyo and Moreno's in Mesa; there's a variety of fast food places like Filiberto's and Someburros; you have you generic family restaurant Mexican like Macayo's, Garcia's, and Tia Rosa's; and then you have your niche places.

La Condesa is one of those niche places, and one of my favorites.  Here, their niche is a slightly fancy take on really simple items like tacos, salsa, and quesadillas.  

The tacos come in several varieties, with meats including chicken, beef, pork, whitefish, and even dogfish shark, and different spices and toppings on each one.  My favorites are, of course, the shark, as well as the black mole, and one of the beef ones (not the Sonoran).

The salsas are also a big draw: prepare to be blown away as you dip your chips in peanut salsa, strawberry salsa, cilantro salsa, or even my personal favorite, pecan salsa.  There are typically about 20 choices, so if you want to try them all, come with a few friends (it does get crowded, though).

The quesadillas are also delicious; they're a southern Mexican fried style.  They're quite heavy, so don't plan on being able to eat two or three tacos *and* a quesadilla.

Oh...and GET THE HORCHATA.  You won't regret it.  I won't describe it, just because I don't want to ruin the surprise.  But it will blow your mind.  Whenever I get it, which is always, someone always asks me what that delicious-looking beverage is."}
{"text":"Great gourmet tacos, great salsa bar, and huge portions!

Was hoping for better street tacos though."}
{"text":"Great spot, the food is amazing, try the horchata it's delicious!!  Friendly staff and cool decor.  Also excellent options for vegetarians.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS.....EVER!  was visiting phoenix and found this place on yelp.  great food, great atmosphere, and AMAZING SALSA BAR."}
{"text":"Wow talk about authentic Mexican food!! Amazing tacos amazing salsa!!! Amazing horchata!!! The food here is pricey but so worth it!! I'm in love you can tell everything is made with love!!! From the second we walked in to when we left they had people coming in and out of the doors! Food came out fast and service was fast for how busy it was! I will be back and so will my party! Best Mexican food in the city hands down!!!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful! Salsas galore! You might have a bit of a wait because this ain't fast food so be sure you bring some patience! Will eat here again and again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with coworkers, boss's treat, wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the Arabe Burro which is basically a Gyro/Burrito fusion drenched in hummus. I loved it so much I had to remake it at home. Will be back with the family for sure!"}
{"text":"I thought I was going to give this place 5 stars. I stopped by for dinner last night with a friend, and we both seemed to have a great meal. I ordered the al pastor quesa, and she ordered the tapatio quesa. We both very much enjoyed the salsa bar too. However, a few hours later, we were both puking our guts out. Update: 12 hours later, still puking."}
{"text":"It was a very decent place. (I still live/die for Ritos)

--Price:  It was $6.99 for my burro.  For its size, it was about average.

--Food:  I had the Oaxacan Black Mole Burro. I was good, but not mind blowing.  I would say it was worth the visit.

--Service:  Alright I guess.  I could take out my balls, rub them on the table, and the waitress would never know.  Take what you want from this.

I read so much about the chips and salsa: Chips sucked my shaved anus but the salsa was good.  I had better at Costco. **Strawberry salsa was good**

Overall it was a good experience (hence the 4 stars), but I will continue giving my money to RITOS."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this shop and have never had anything there that wasn't delicious. They have tacos, burritos, quesas, and tortas. I've had tacos, burritos, and quesas (think thicker, deep fried quesadilla) and have never been disappointed.  I really love the tacos because you can get two tacos with rice and beans for about 10 bucks and be completely filled. Their horchata is really delicious and soaked in nuts and fruit for an interesting take on typical horchata. They make an AMAZING spicy margarita and a magnificent michelada---I can't even tell you how great they are. Of course, their salsa bar is my favorite part of this restaurant: 15 salsas that are unique and flavorful. The only reason I give this a 4 instead of 5 is because the last few times I have come (at varying times/days), they have been swamped and they only have 2 waiters. I recognize the space is really tiny (only about 8 or 9 tables and the bar counter) but there's also no real waiting area, which can get annoying in the summer."}
{"text":"The burro was fabulous. Hard to describe how wonderful the food is. The horchata was the best we ever had."}
{"text":"I always get the street tacos and my boyfriend always gets the quesadillas. You can't go wrong with either of those.  They have a pecan salsa that is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Food is amazing I recommend the tiger shrimp tacos or the arrachera tacos. Salsa Bar is amazing. It's small and there is a wait but there's a reason why. It was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Holy cow!!  Easy the best taco joint I've been to in AZ.  Unbelievable variety.  Shark, marlin, mole, al pastor, grilled cactus, million-hour slow roasted pork shoulder, on and on.  Three of us tried about 10, and every one was incredible.  As good as the tacos were, I would go back and eat nothing but the chips and salsa bar.  The salsa variety was amazing.  Never had anything like it.  And to top it off, they have a specialty horchata with strawberries, cantaloupe, pecans and who knows what else.  Not a huge horchata fan, but this was magic.  Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I have only been here for brunch, but can't wait to try lunch or dinner on for size!  We were the first table in on Sunday and were greeted right away by our server and felt at home with its cozy interior.  It's a small place but has lots of character with the heavy solid wood and wrought iron furniture.  Love the Dia de Los Muertos art and heavy wood bar with cowhide bar stools and authentic Mexican glassware.

We sampled quite a few of the salsas at the salsa bar and there is a little something for everyone including those that can't take a lot of spice.  This is a big plus for us since our family has spice tolerances from 1 to 10+.

What was on our menu? we tried the divorced eggs (which I added avacado), black mole chilaquiles with chicken, and an egg scramble with side of bacon; all of which were served with black beans.... Delicious and full of flavor! I'll have to post the brunch menu next time since it is not currently on their website.

Each of us would order the same thing again, but so want to try the other items of delicousness on their menu.

I guess we will have to make La Condesa a staple on our restaurant list!"}
{"text":"I went back to this place this evening and it was not even close to being as good as it was the last time. When we arrived (7ish) they were out of steak and guacamole! We went ahead and ordered other things but it was not very good. Last of all, we had to wait over An hour for the food to arrive! I won't go back. Ever. I think Guy F should take his sign off his wall!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Had the street tacos.  They were amazing.  Prices are good, variety is great.  Love the gluten free options.  Missed good Mexican food.  Will be a regular here."}
{"text":"Dinner at La Santisima is becoming a Friday night tradition and I have to say I'm pretty happy about it! My husband has become obsessed with this place. If it were up to him we would be here at least 3 days a week. We had no idea this place was on Trippe D we just knew Jason V. and many of my fellow yelp friends really liked this place. We decided to give it a try and now it's our go to spot. Not only do they have some really great taco's as advertised but their, burritos, salsa's, margarita's, and horchata are some of the best I've ever had. So far my very favorites have been their Cabo Shrimp Taco: Corn tortilla stuffed with beer battered shrimp. Shrimp was giant, crispy, and tasty. Their Green Chili burrito and their horchata! I usually dont like horchata at all but this one is addicting. It is topped with a drizzles of caramel, strawberries, and pecans and you can just taste that it's home made. We have a had great service, and I find it strange that there has never been a wait. But hey I'll take it, more for me!! We recently brought my mom and her husband here and they too loved it. So I will be seeing you next Friday!!"}
{"text":"Wow...this place is so good it is ridiculous!  The Azteca Chicken Tinga quesa was amazing and the carne asada burro was to die for!  The food is so flavorful.  The salsa bar is fantastic...so many choices and they all have such good flavor."}
{"text":"My parents taught me, \"when you don't have something nice to say, then don't say anything at all.\"

Yelp has taught me, \"when you don't have something nice to say, tell it like it is.\"

Sorry mom and dad, Yelp FTW!

I like my restaurants how I like my style, un-cramped; unfortunately, this place is packed full with wall to wall tables and chairs leaving about 3 inches in between you and the guy at the table next to you. Don't plan to come here during the lunch rush with a big group, you're lucky if you can fit one or two people through the door. The parking isn't that appealing either, you are practically parked in the middle of 16th street traffic. :-/

La Condesa makes a pretty good taco, and their salsa ain't bad either. To their benefit, they do have some fairly unique salsa's to choose from, such as strawberry, peanut, and pecan; but in my opinion, unique doesn't necessarily = awesome. Any of their tacos will do you right, but my favorite is their pork.  

In my opinion, and lets face it, if you're reading my review, that's exactly what you're looking for right? La Condesa over stated when they went with Gourmet in the name. Sure, everybody likes their taco's but who wants to pay $9 for two tacos and leave feeling like they were packed in like sardines in the middle of a seedy neighborhood? If it isn't obvious yet, I don't plan on coming back soon, I can take or leave their salsas and tacos and wouldn't be bothered either way.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, hope you find that hidden taco gem you've always been searching for."}
{"text":"I was hard core craving Mexican food and had previously bookmarked this place so we decided to check it out. 

Parking was no issue and we were seated right away. We received a bottle of water and a bowl of chips without even having to ask for it. The salsa bar was extensive but many of the salsas had run out. The available salsas were amazing. Especially the pecan salsa, which I had never had before, was awesome. Creamy and rich. 

I got the Tlaloc cactus burrito (can be made vegan or vegetarian). My first time eating cactus! The Tlaloc was yummy but made with too much oil, I had grease dripping down my hands while eating it. The oil was a definite turn off and 1/5 of it would have sufficed to pan-fry the veggies. That's why I'm deducting a star. 

I'll be back to try a fish taco or quesadilla."}
{"text":"Man, I've never given such a low review... where do I start?
So I get an hour long lunch everyday. I work extremely close to La Santisma, so I figured that this would be a great place to check out and that I'd have plenty of time to sit down and enjoy my food. Wrong.

I showed up with a coworker around 2:30pm. There were maybe 18 other customers MAX in the restaurant. It took about 15 minutes for us to get cups of water and it took 30-35 minutes for someone to take our order. And had I not approached a waitress requesting to have our orders taken, it probably would've taken longer. There were plenty of waiters and waitresses standing around, chatting. Customers that came in after us were served before us.

The menu is huge. There is SO much to choose from. This is a huge plus! It's a little overwhelming but I LOVE variety. I couldn't decide so I asked the waitress to tell me what the spiciest burrito on the menu was. I ended up requesting the Mayan burro.

While we were waiting for our food to arrive, we checked out the awesome salsa bar. I LOVE salsa and tried every single one of their options. My favorite was definitely the cilantro one as well as the green chile one. We visited the salsa bar 3-4 times (seriously, we loved it), and our food still hadn't arrived.

Upon its arrival, we had to wait an extra couple of minutes for utensils and napkins. By the time we had everything, we had maybe 10 minutes left to eat our food. I ended up eating a fourth of my burrito and took the rest to go. I was late for work.

The burrito itself was not spicy, but it was good! It was a good portion, it was $9.99, and it was very flavorful... after I drowned it in salsa. Honestly, I probably wouldn't get it again. And I know this place is known for their tacos and not their burritos, so I'll be sure to check them out if I ever come here again. And to be quite blunt, I don't know if I ever will. I'm not sure the food is worth the wait and the horrible service...

As much as I loved the salsa bar and the ambiance, I definitely feel like there's some other place out there that has better service and better salsa.

Until the next time I decide to visit this location and update my review, this place gets two stars for me. I might even consider just doing take out because there is no way I'm waiting again. I can only imagine how long the wait is during lunch hour...

There are so many areas for improvement. I truly do hope some of these concerns are addressed. I really wanted to like the place, but I just can't get past the horrible service."}
{"text":"MMMMM!!! Love this place! The Salsa bar is awesome. They have updated it since the last time we went so they now have a full bar! YAY!  The prices are great and you get sooo much food. My boyfriend and I was always have left-overs that heat up wonderfully in the toaster oven . There is not a lot of seating but that's down town dining for ya."}
{"text":"Really good - fresh food!  Lots of variety in what to order and what salsas to get.  Even my 2.5 year old loved his ginormous quesadilla.  We will be returning."}
{"text":"My absolutely favorite place to eat tacos in Phoenix... wait, make that Arizona! So happy they got the expansion done because more people should visit this little gem when visiting. Don't let the neighborhood discourage you from coming - the tacos are worth the drive! Get the al pastor and tinga... don't forget to have a margarita too as they are oh so good!! Enjoy the salsa bar in the second room too."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Mexican food so when my sister took me to this restaurant, I was not expecting to me blown away. Except I was! I loved this place, from the beans to the different types of salsa and the to-die for carne asada tacos! My boyfriend had the al pastor burrito which he loved as well. Service was great however my only complaint is that there aren't enough servers. We found ourselves waiting a lot but I knew it wasn't our server's fault. She was just extremely busy. 

5/5 stars for sure! :)"}
{"text":"Small restaurant, really good food. The Shark taco and Horchata are the best I've ever had. Don't care too much for the name of the restaurant (theme) or the dark artwork displayed. The food was worth me tolerating these images of the  SPIRIT of Death....he...he..."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and thought this might be a worthy try. Opened the front door and BAM a large party was seated exactly in front of the door. Awkward! I waited at the 'wait to be seated sign', right in front of the party of 15...took the host a bit longer than I like to wait... With all of the diners kinda staring at you. Iist not like they didn't have space in the restaurant. It's really a good size. But for some reason they thought it was smart to put a large party right in front of the entrance door. I ordered to go and it's taking a while for me to  get my meal. So much for to go. Not a great part of town, just a bit of blight. Safe, tho', just the environment of this part of town leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican I have had in a long time! They have a great salsa bar with tons of variety (I like the Mexican salsa) and a great guac that has chunks of jicama, tomato and mango. So delicious. The tamarin margarita also was tasty!"}
{"text":"We visited here on a Saturday afternoon and we immediately knew this was a place that we would be returning to regularly. The food was wonderful and the salsa bar was just plain fun. The wait staff was extremely helpful in understanding their menu and her recommendations were spot on.  We're looking forward to working our way through their entire menu, one visit at a time!"}
{"text":"This is a unique place. Your first impression is \"sketchy\".  Type of place you would only go in with a recommendation or if you were local. I'm glad we got a recommendation because this was a good eat. I had the burrito norteno with green chilli; very good. Shark and shrimp tacos for the rest of the table and it all looked good with good comments. 

This is a small place with only ten tables and a small bar. The service is quick despite obvious take out orders and a full dining room. Salsa is homemade and presented in Tupperware on an ice bar, with a ton of different choices. 

Ambiance is interesting, true to its name. 


Tip o the hat - coke served in glass bottles 

Wage of the finger - find a better presentation for your awesome salsas."}
{"text":"Have I really not reviewed this place?! I've been coming here for years & just love it. Their salsa bar is bomb.com...you must try the pecan one! It's sweet, unexpected, and has a good kick. Quesas are wonderful. Try a taco protein style. You can thank me later..."}
{"text":"I came to Phoenix for a business trip and didn't want to eat near the arena so I looked up any nearby triple d restaurants. I randomly chose one to yelp and from the reviews and pictures, we chose this one. The whole ride there I was salivating over the pictures of the deep fried quesas. I knew I wanted to try that and the fish tacos. It did not disappoint. Soo good!! And on top of that they have a salsa bar with like 10 different salsas you can try! Super friendly staff. One of the waiters gave me a bag of chips no charge to take to go with all the yummy salsas! I would definitely be coming back here when I visit Phoenix in the future!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best places my wife and I have ate at. I definitely recommend people to check it out . The agua frescas were so taste and the salsa bar had so many options. Definitely check it out if you are a local or just visiting the city."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful the margaritas are top notch service was good. My only problem with this place is that it's too small for the amount of people that come in here. I seen a signed picture of Chef Guy that was signed for diners,drive inn ,and dives; from 2 years sago. I wonder with all the business that they have seen why not expand? But anywhoo, everything was great I just don't like feeling rushed due to others coming in, starring waiting for a table."}
{"text":"What a cute place! Its small but cozy and I have yet to be disappointed with their menu. The only thing I don't like is the tiny cups and location of the salsa bar. Make sure you come in at an abnormal time if you don't want to sit compact. I recommend the tacos and the enchiladas topped with Mole sauce"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant with very tasty food. A good variety of Mexican favorites with a gourmet treat. Servings are large, plates could be shared.  Not a huge venue and gets filled up quickly. Great salsa bar to try different salsas"}
{"text":"I absolutely cannot describe the amazingness that is La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop. Gourmet it is. From the top to the bottom. Service, Style, Food, the whole 9. Do not be fouled by the neighborhood... this place SHINES like a diamond in the rough. 

I am SOOO bummed that we were only in Phoenix for the night, cause I would have set up shop here every night. THE SALSA BAR!!! AHHH! We tried EVERY ONE. AMAZING. 

Our amazing bartender/server was David. He killed it. He even made me a Skinny Margarita. They make their own juices there for the Margs...mmmmm. Yep. 

They are authentic. The fish is fresh. They put up with me wanting no oil and after ordering 1 taco... he put up with me ordering 2 more, after the place should have been closed. This was all done with a smile and kindness that is unfortunately rare these days. 

Even just thinking about that taco... Grilled Mahi w/ a ton of veggies, spinach, onions,  wrapped in a homemade tortilla, guac, TONS of dipping sauces... literally melted in my mouth.

If you are EVER in the Phoenix area--- YOU MUST STOP BY. If I am even an hour with-in it's radius I will be running back.

Not. To. Be. Missed."}
{"text":"They have so many different salsas to pick from...(Mango, Strawberry etc etc) 
We tried almost all of them with the homemade chips as we waited for our food. 

I ordered the chicken Quesadilla, but this one came with a deep fried corn tortilla covering all of the goodness in the middle. It was great because it was gluten free friendly. It was a big meal and well worth very bite."}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow at peak times but food is great! The mole chicken quesadilla is where it's at. My advice is to order ahead of time then show up like 15 minutes after they say it will be ready."}
{"text":"The Yelp rating is what made me drive out of my way to pickup a late lunch. If I were just driving by this shop I would have never stopped. 
I ordered a three taco plate with three different tacos. I do not remember the names, but they were ALL excellent! I ordered a Quesadilla. It is different from the Americanized version but I did not care for it. Love all the salsas!"}
{"text":"The portions were huge at a great price.  You have all types of sauces to chose from but the taco entrees were flavorful enough that you didn't need to sauce it up.  

A great casual joint to fill yourself up."}
{"text":"I love the artwork.  Its a tiny little restaurant crammed with a bunch of little tables and chairs.  You go up to order at the counter, there's a salsa bar in the corner with a LOT of different salsas (most are not that great).  They do bring you the food and you do get a basket of chips on the house.  The tacos are pretty heft - about 3 bucks each.  They are \"Gourmet tacos\" after all..  

All in all, its kind of uncomfortable service/restaurant wise (self serve) but the tacos are very good and you do get chips and a variety of salsas.  Not the most friendly staff and the cost is kind of high for a place like this but its pretty dang good.  Get it to go if you don't mind packing a bunch of salsa cups."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Dirty. Lame service. 
After waiting 20 minutes, seeing plenty of empty tables and still not seated,  we watched one of the workers throw down two big bags of ice (to bust the cubes loose) onto the floor. Then the bags were opened, lifted, laid on the bin, and raised up until empty, shaking all the ice into the open bin. 

here's the problem - -
The bag protects the ice, but as soon as it is thrown on the floor, the outside of the bag gets contaminated.  The floor they were thrown on was already soaking wet, in a very dark area behind the bar.

After I witnessed this huge mistake, it made me think we should just leave. So we did but I told them why. The person in charge pretty much brushed me off, and the bag-dropping guy mentioned how it's \"just the bag\"... that got dirty...

I didn't feel any change would really take place after pointing out what we just saw, and how the guy so casually brushed off my concern. Wow!

We've been here five times before, and I'm wondering what kind of sanitation problems they have in the kitchen, where nobody can see, if they so openly soil the ice in my drink. 

Disgraceful.  I trusted them, but now I don't."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this spot as I drive by it almost every day. My boyfriend and I decided to check it out on a week night. The place was very busy so there was a thirty minute wait. Once we were seated to took more than 15 min to have our drink order taken. We ordered our food and proceeded to wait another half hour. The tacos were \"specialty\", but I didn't enjoy any of them . The chicken mile was not good at all. There was a thin layer of beans which was almost comical. The pricing was ridiculous to top it off. I will NEVER go back there again and strongly discourage my friends from even trying it."}
{"text":"Found this place while traveling in Phoenix on Yelp.  We were in the mood for good Mexican food and this is the place to go.  It also was a featured place on DDD and so I was happy to visit a place that Guy had visited and recommended.  Loved the Art Work on the walls there."}
{"text":"Driving down the rough streets of north phoenix, I have never really taken the time to look at the many restaurants that adorn the streets. I thought north phoenix was really only pawn shops, tire shops, and smoke shops, but my gf had heard of this place so we made a special journey out to La Condesa. After checking to make sure our doors were locked 4 times, we entered this \"gourmet\" taco shop...and boom all my misconceptions were erased.

This place is extremely clean and friendly. The tacos I ordered were overflowing with flavor and ingredients. I was thoroughly filled after two tacos.  I had the Shrimp tacos - not the cabo ones, i think they were simply grilled and guess what? that's right, no diarrhea afterwards. Also had the the sonoran carne asada tacos....which were arrachera steak marinated with fresh garlic & olive oil, charbroiled with mesquite charcoal. The tacos were amazing and the salsa bar was mind blowing. The yhave about 12 salsas to try from and I had to try them all. My personal favorites were the cilantro, chipotle and the surprisingly  yummy peanut salsa.

I REALLY wanted the horchata, but they had just run out..i won't ding them for running out because we did come in 5 minutes before closing. Can't wait to go back here, you gotta give this place a try."}
{"text":"Love the salsa bar with so many different varieties from sweet and fruity to hot and juicy"}
{"text":"What more can you ask for from a legit Mexican restaurant? La Santisima has the tacos and salsa bar that make up Mexican food euphoria, and even offers serious vegetarian options. 

My friend and I had dinner here. Driving from El Paso to Los Angeles, we had become sick of Chex Mix and energy drinks. I didn't realize La Santisima had been featured on Food Network's Triple D, but the Guy Fieri memorabilia gave it away immediately. In a fantastically awkward moment made possible by fourth generation cellular technology, we watched the restaurant's Food Network VODs right as the server came to take our order. The server let us finish watching.

There were more tacos available at the restaurant than its online menu currently displays. The veggie tacos I ordered were a classic guac, black bean, pico, and lettuce combination. They also offer a grilled zucchini type side for those that are looking to avoid eating rice. The food was fantastic. The freshness was palpable and the flavors were balanced. With so many salsas to choose from, I felt like a child in a candy store. Did I mix salsas? You bet I did. Maybe people should start saying, \"I felt like Chris at a salsa bar.\"

The restaurant had an odd atmosphere. Maybe it was the mermaid skeleton with dollar bills clipped to it. La Santisima wasn't quick - despite being an odd hour in the afternoon, our food took quite some time. They also charged for every basket of chips past basket numero uno. I'm sure the United Federation of Restaurants that Proudly Serve Chips and Salsa was furious at the first member restaurant to offer unlimited chips - that restaurant set a ridiculous expectation!

La Santisima was pretty tasty, and I would return for the salsas and tacos. I'm excited to see if Los Angeles has similar options."}
{"text":"Great food great art fair service ...
The service could be better
The short little guy up front has a terrible attitude.
Food is great the staff needs to Up There GAME !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I go here weekly. Love tue cilantro salsa and the steak tacos my fav! The paintings are a great addition to the local culture."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended and I'm glad we checked it out! Variations on traditional faves and new offerings I've never heard of. So many choices we'll be back for sure. The tacos were melt in your mouth, I could have had a dozen. Salsa bar has unique flavors and everything was delicious. Could have been 5 stars but service was great, but painfully slow."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove out to Glendale to wander the shops and discovered that many of them are closed on Sunday. Oh well, we were hungry so made that our priority! We got out our phones and decided to check Yelp reviews for a good Mexican restaurant. La Santisima Gourmet Tacos popped up:)

We were welcomed immediately when we entered and received outstanding service. The restaurant has a cool vibe with colorfully striped chairs and large, vibrant paintings of Frida, Diego, images of Dia de Los Muertos and other iconic images. 

A lot of Mexican restaurants have salsa bars, but not with this many freshly made salsas and in such flavorful varieties. We had to stop ourselves from eating chips so we would have room for our lunch! I tried the combination plate of three street tacos with rice and beans. All were fantastic, but the spicy pork was my favorite! My husband had a quesadilla that he raved about. And he grew up in AZ, so he is picky about Mexican food! We'll definitely return...with friends:)"}
{"text":"Best horchata EVER!  The salsa bar is great, they have a huge variety to try.  The shark dog fish tacos are great...a MUST try.  The place is somewhat small, but if you come at the right time there is no wait."}
{"text":"We had a party of 13 on a quiet Saturday noon. Sure they have the Salsa Bar but the food doesn't measure up to what I have been reading. We had everything from Burro's to Street Taco's to SPECIAL Taco's.  The overall opinion was just OK. Let me speak on my 3 Carne Asada street Taco's with beans and rice. Taco's were not even close to being hot. Not even warm. Meat quality and tenderness was poor. Beans were GREAT. What the hell is white rice doing in a Mexican restaurant? Had better at the same price. Had to ask for chips and more water. Poor teenage waitress was worked. I realize they add 18% automatically but then don't ask for another tip on the check. Service and food was not worth 18%. Would we go back NO. Too many Mexican restaurants in the valley to have poor food. Oh well you go you might enjoy it. It's your money ."}
{"text":"Warning : this place WILL knock your socks off so either wear flip flops or proceed cautiously with your toes curled.   Really can't go wrong with any of their tacos. Probably my favorite is the LA Santissima specialty taco with the toasted cheese on top. The shrimp taco is also really good.   Their burritos are delicious. Salsa bar has huge selection and some very unique flavors. Beans and rice are also top quality. Prepare to leave absolutely stuffed because good luck holding yourself back from eating their generous portions. And after it's all said and done make sure you try their horchata (perfect end to a fantastic meal!)"}
{"text":"Best Horchata EVER!  The Tacos and salsa were also some of the best I have ever had.  Try the mole taco."}
{"text":"Absolutely sensational food! For example, the best guacamole we've ever had. Raisins and mangoes in guacamole? Who would have thought of that! Marvelous! Everything we ordered was prepared from fresh, high quality ingredients, and was served almost as soon as our orders were place. The black mole tacos were wonderful; earthy, smokey and rich mole sauce balanced off by pickled red onions. Our server, Louis, was attentive and informative. We'll be taking friends to try the place soon. It's the closest thing to the Barrio Cafe you'll find on the West Side of town."}
{"text":"My profound love of Mexican cuisine and a bevy of shining Yelp reviews of this place led me here last Saturday night. My BF and I arrived just after 7pm, which was perfect because just after we ordered the place filled up- fast!

The salsa bar is fantastic! Some of my fave's were the peanut, chipotle, strawberry and a chunky dark one who's name escapes me..... But really they were all good.

The very best taco that we tried was the Cochinita Pibil (sp?) It was heavenly- packed with meat that had a kind of smokey, kind of mole/chocolaty taste- it was incredible. All the taco's we had were great though. To start with- the tortillas are so freaking good on their own, and they pack the meat inside of them. I'm getting hungry just thinking about them.

Lastly, my BF is a lifelong connoisseur  of quesadillas, so we ordered a steak one to split. Holy crap- it was a monster! They split it up for us but it looked like we ordered two of them! Humongous! It resembled a strudel pastry! Big, flaky and lightly drizzled with something white, sour cream maybe? I dunno, but it was to die for!  Even the next day when we reheated our leftovers this cheesy doughy meaty concoction was still fantastic! The chicken tinga burrito was almost BETTER the following day! (Maybe because it didnt have to compete with any tacos)! 

All in all we were very satisfied and will definitely be back. I would like to wait for a bit cooler weather though, because the place is quite warm inside. That is why I only gave it four stars."}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place. I was in the area to get a haircut with fave barber but told he was on break. So I decided to venture out in the area for lunch. The beautiful entrance door caught my attention and decided to try it.

Since I broke my foot, I'm crutchin' along with the dang boot on my left foot. I must have arrived minutes before the lunch rush. I sat at a little table in a corner. Waitress took my order.  Because the tables are so close to one another and filled, I couldn't go to the Salsa bar to try a few sauces. 

I ordered the guacamole which was yummy -- love guaca guaca! When I ordered two chicken tacos, I expected two nice size tacos. Instead I felt as though I ordered two tacos off the menu section for kids.

Waitress never returned to refill my glass of tea. I may return and give this place a try when I'm no longer in need of crutches. Nothing grand here...now run along kids...

PS...They do not accept AMEX!"}
{"text":"La Santisma has great and unique tacos (plus a bar full of different salsas you can try with your chips!) And the food is why you go to a restaurant--but so is the atmosphere. Unfortunately, that's lacking here. The place is small and not in the best part of town. We had to wait outside for a long time and saw some questionable characters. Go for the tacos, not the atmosphere, and not during prime time so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!! In my opinion, the best thing on the menu is the chorizo and potato taco!!! Can't wait to come back this place! Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Delicious Food, great service, and amazing Salsa Bar.   Only complaint is this place is always crowded.  It's hard to get in and out on your lunch break."}
{"text":"Service is taking too long lately. I don't like waiting for 15mins just to place a Togo order, mostly because no one pays anY attention to the customers at the register or waiting to be seated. Also the bean burrito was good but not worth $9.00. Tacos use to be packed and for a great price. Now they are chincy even with the calabacitas. I paid $7.00 for a Mexican squash sliced and grilled. I could have paid 65 cents for the squash and pan grilled like they did. Very sad. I wish they made tacos like they use to before they went on triple d (food network). They still have good salsa (strawberry is delish) but they have lost the taco. I don't wanna pay $4.00 for a chincy taco that has no filling. Btw give more beans and rice, it doesn't cost much to make either so give at least 2 tablespoons instead of one. I'm very serious about the serving size."}
{"text":"Got to come here for the salsa bar.  Awesome.  Good prices for food items too.  The service is also excellent.  The server even game my daughter a complimentary horchata.  If La Santisima was within an hour from my home I would go there every week."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  I don't like the paper they use on the wicker baskets they use for plates, because the food is soo juicy it soaks through the paper and attaches to my food.  Also, because the baskets have paper covers on top there is no way to use as vessels for their amazing salsa bar, so you have to use the tiniest little plastic cups to try out the salsas and make about 10 trips to get enough of every kind you'd like.  I would have given this place 5 stars but I do not like paper bits on my food."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Kinda steep on the pricing, but the size of the tacos is by far one of the largest portions you can get. This place is great if you want to eat some good ole unadulterated tacos. The salsa bar is outstanding as well, a lot of different styles and heat levels."}
{"text":"Place is a bit overrated.   Good salsa bar but tortillas for the tacos were pretty average and the meat on the arrachera tacos not particularly tender.  The fish tacos were very good."}
{"text":"A unique taco place set in downtown Phoenix. The menu is diverse and they use fresh ingredients. I can't stress enough how much our city has needed a special place like this. It features something for everyone!!! The salsa bar alone will have your taste buds wanting more!!! 
The veggie quesadilla is to die for!!!! The fried touch they give to it adds something you can't get anyplace else. Oh and before you leave you have to try their Horchata!!! If you like Horchata then you haven't tasted anything like this one!!!! It could win awards, seriously!! I was a little nervous when I heard they add fruit and nuts to it, but then I tried it....it was gone in minutes!!!! 
Anything you order here is going to be fabulous and fresh. You don't leave feeling heavy like when you eat Mexican food sometimes. I can't rave enough about this place!!! Try and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"After Dos Molinas (food is spicier) this is my second favorite Mexican Food place. Lots of variety.  I have only had real mole at two places, unfortunately, their version did not grab my taste buds (probably why there is your favorite potato salad (in my case my mom's) and everything pales in comparison). I avoid lines, by eating early say around 3pm."}
{"text":"Love this cute little place, love the food, servers are nice and helpful, and OMG, the salsa bar just makes me so happy, how many kinds of salsa do they leave out for everyone to taste?  10? 20?  I don't know, but I get excited thinking about it.

Now I'm just never going to suffer ambiance without the tastiest of food, because I do go to restaurants for the food, primarily.  I like one-of-a-kind, personal restaurants, because you know you are in the kitchen of someone who fed people they loved first, and then spread it out.  But I've taken a date there because its a fun slightly chaotic festive-feeling place while still feeling like its neighborhood,  it's not particularly quiet, but not at all too loud to hear, tables kind of close together, which kind of forces everyone to smile at and speak to strangers more than your average dining experience.  We love to bring a crowd from out of town, as it feels really homey, and is colorful, tasty, friendly, can be hard to get a table because its small and they do get busy, but just wait.  Worth the wait. Their Al Pastor makes my mouth really happy."}
{"text":"This place is located on the old strip drag of Glendale, AZ. The food is very good and uniquely paired together tacos! I had the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Tacos Yum!! My daughter ordered Cabo Shrimp Tacos (We had to share!;)) loved them both! And I loved the the decor and I enjoyed the ambience. We have been a few times our dentist is located down the street, we went once with my fiancé another wth my daughter and youngest son, and both times was fantastico! Keep up the great food! Happy eating! I gave four because it took our server a longer than normal wait to come take our drink order and food order."}
{"text":"First off thank you fellow Yelpers for leading me here!! 

So far I've been here twice and I will definitely be back...again...and again...and again! ((And again)) Both visits were for lunch, round one was a to go order of Al Pastor street tacos ** we will start here. 

I walked in (the fancy shmancy wooden doors next to the Tienda) and it was jam packed. And this was around 2:30 on a weekday and it really is a little restaurant AND the character and ambiance are unique. So inviting. Anyway, I first attempted to order the Asada tacos...then mole however they were sold out .... Hence the al pastor. The flavors were amazing. They weren't (in my opinion) traditional, however they were delicious and I WILL order them again in the future. 

My second visit was a sit down lunch around 1:00 on a Wednesday with the hubs. We were able to sit, eat, and relax before my one hour lunch was finished. So they are very quick!! The place got packed closer to 2:00 by people of all ages which is a really good sign. Anyway, I ordered the black mole tacos and the hubs got a trio street taco plate. *{Holy Moly}* Yelpers!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Everything this restaurant serves could be considered magical bursts of flavors that rock your Mind!!! 

Just come here and eat. The food is to die for. The salsa bar is something to be rivaled and their margaritas look heavenly (I need to go when I'm off the clock!!)

//cheers//"}
{"text":"This is by far the best place in phoenix for Mexican food. they have yummy chocolate tacos too! Their variety of sauces was unlimited. The ambiance was perfect for Halloween :)"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place so bad. Ordered $45 worth of food for 2 people. Problem was that we never received our drinks or chips. We told the waitress after 15 minutes and just watched 5 tables after us get their drinks, chips and food. Waitress finally came around and gave us chips and then told us it will be a few more minutes for our 2 cokes. We then told her that we just want to get our money back. Then instead of her giving us our money back, dhe made us stand in the long line again and didnt even apologize. WOW... unbelievable. We ended up total spending about 40 minutes there and didnt even eat anything. I understand that the food is great but not gonna spend a dime if they dont provide good service...."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is HORRIBLE!! Slowest greeters and servers ever! One hour wait from seated to food on table. Good thing they were not busy because it would most likely have been 2 hours! Asked for an Horchata 20 minutes and still nothing. Had to get up and go ask for it. I won't be back such a turn off to have bad service. If no stars possible I would have selected that."}
{"text":"I came here to eat with my co-workers at lunch time and it was packed!!!!! This was obviously a great sign, but know it's packed during the lunch hour. 

The place is small but seats quite a few people. You may also sit by the bar to eat (which is what we did since we didn't want to have to wait forever to eat). 

I had 3 carne asada tacos with rice and beans. The meat was well seasoned and they double up on tortillas so they def won't fall apart. 

The highlight for me was the salsa bar. Omg it was yummy! They have your traditional salsas, like salsa verde, salsa bandera etc, but also have very inventive yet delicious spins on the ordinary, like their salsa siete chiles (7 types of roasted chiles with red onion and it was super chunky) or another salsa made with a base of chopped radish.  

It was great that they also gave us a basket of super crispy chips to enjoy with all the salsas. 

The ONLY thing that I did not like was that I saw drinks poured at the bar and the bar tender grabbed the fruit out of the open bin with his bare hands. I had a bottled drink, but would have not asked for a drink if the bar were the only option. Just to be clear, the kitchen staff had gloves and you could see into the kitchen, which was organized and clean."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. My husband, daughter and I used to come here once a week. Then they added the extra vegetarian options. Yay! Because I'm a vegetarian.

Definetly TRY this place at least once. It is good. And if you are vegetarian or vegan you will loooooove it. I promise. It just isnt one of those \"eat once a week\" kind of restaurants anymore.

I'm not going to give it 5 stars now, even though 6 months to a year ago I would've given it 5 stars (is 10 possible?) For some reason the prices went up and the quality of the food feels like it has been steadily declining. Everytime we go its just not what it used to be. Maybe there's new management? A new cook? I'm not sure. But if you had asked me 6 months ago about the place I would not have hesitated to recommend it. 

Its definetly authentic though I'll give them that. I love this restaurant and really hope that the quality starts going back up because I miss eating there. It was the only restaurant my family and I would go to. And with the new vegetarian options. My goodness, I would eat here every day!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at La Santisima today. Food was great, their horchata is awesome, and I loved the salsa bar. They were packed so the service was slow but totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Somewhat of a rip-off! Another one of those Mexican places for White people that do not know better. I can honestly say I have never had a spicy flavorless burrito, now I can. First we were given a can of soda and charged $3 for it. 2017 let's get a fountain system you cheap bastards. We tried the tacos and I was really excited after reading the other reviews and wah wah, flat and not filling. After we left we went to another taco place because we were craving good tacos. I love to spend money on good food and this was not it. The quality of the food does not match the high prices. If you are a foodie you are better off at a taco truck, any taco truck."}
{"text":"Wife and I came during vacation and arrived about 10 minutes after opening. There were already 3 parties there at 11am. Promising.

Orders were taken at the cashier, then sat down with a number. The menu was a little confusing with all these caveats and pricing schemes, but at the end of the day, we got some tacos and we liked them.

*** FOOD ***
They allow you to create \"meals\", so we got two - one with 2 gourmet tacos and another 3 street tacos. 

Cochinita Pibil Street Taco (5/5)
Mouthwatering and delicious. Pork was super juicy and well worth it. You'll see this in many other reviews and there's a reason for that. 

Al Pastor Street Taco (2/5)
I have a habit of always trying my favorite meat everywhere even if the reviews suggest otherwise. Wasn't really a fan, flavor was a bit lacking. 

Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Gourmet Taco (4/5)

Cabo Shrimp Gourmet Taco (4/5)


*** DRINK ***
I have two categories of Mexican places. Places that serve horchatas and places that don't. (The latter contends with Taco Bell.) However, living on the east coast most of my life, I haven't seen anything other than a normal horchata... I had a pleasant surprise here.

Fruit & Pecan Horchata (5/5) 
Topped with strawberries, pecans, and a healthy dose of cinnamon, this had enough body (i.e., not watered down) to take on the sweetness delivered by the fruit and still taste like an horchata. It was novel and delicious. Highly recommended.

*** BOTTOM LINE ***
Check it out. It's worth it. Get an horchata. And one to go."}
{"text":"I first saw Guy Fieri's visit on TV. I have Family in Phoenix so I said I had to try it out on my next visit. I was just there with my Family this past weekend. I was blown away by the decor and delicious food. It was everything that Guy Fieri said on his show and more!! I can't wait to go back to Phoenix so I can eat there again!!"}
{"text":"i drove from avondale expecting something worthy of such a long drive. salsa bar was very good. the chips were nothing above normal as was the food. the worst part of it all is while i was midway thru a taco a bug scattered across my plate. when i went to go pay i mentioned this to the waitress which only shrugged and took my bill. didnt apologize or even seem remotely interested in my complaint. i wasnt expecting a free meal by any means but a sign of concern was expected."}
{"text":"Oh Food Network, how you have let me down. Honestly, I should have known better because Guy Fieri seems to always think everything that goes into his mouth in his show Diners Drive-Ins and Dives is \"dynamite.\" Seriously, I mean, has he ever said anything negative? I've been to many restaurants he had endorsed on his show and have generally been disappointed... La Santisima would be on that list as well. I can't just blame Guy though, because Yelp also has raving reviews for it. Perculiar...

I came here an hour before closing time on a Wednesday. No wait. We were given a complimentary basket of freshly fried tortilla chips. I was impressed when I was told by the waitress of their selection of 18 sauces at the sauce station. Who doesn't love sauce?! Unfortunately I tried nearly half of them and none of them really stood out. For my meal, I decided to order the tacos since that is what they are known for. I got three a la carte gourmet tacos which were $3.99 a piece: pacific white fish taco, aztec tinga taco, and el gaucho taco. They all tasted just okay which was a disappointment because from all the reviews I was expecting some sort of out-of-body experience when, in fact, I've had way better tacos just about everywhere else. I had a taste of my husband's chicken quesadilla (I think the La Santisima Specialities Quesa) which I thought was actually better than the tacos. Still not awesome, but better. The crust was thick which is unlike any quesadillas I've had before. The quesadilla comes in a rather large portion and is very hearty. 

Overall, this place is definitely overhyped. I rather have Taco Bell."}
{"text":"You want me to review La Santisima? 

What're you, stoop'id? 

 They're beyond review; they're beyond contestation. 

Any reviews in attempt to describe La Santisima, or otherwise are as follows: Effutiation. 

It means \"Useless words\", before you ask. 

And what I say, what We say about La Santisima, is futile. 

Do you know they've been in the news? They've been on national TV. 

They've been hit on by the platinum porcupine himself, Guy Fieri, or whatever his name is. He, like Pamela Anderson, is only famous for His Triple D's.

So...

There is nothing we can. 

They're like a living mythological land you can visit. 

Ive eaten at both locations, hell I've eaten here before they were \"La Santisima\" and were named something else. Didn't know that shit, did you? 

Yeah, huh, Little trivia for ya. 

Ive opened both locations  & and I've closed both locations. I've had every Salsa the bar can offer and I've had 16 menu items -- multiple times -- and fuck what I'm saying and just fucking go here! 

. . . 

Why are you still reading? 

Go! 

Ok, still don't get it? 

So i'm giving you another word ( It's real before you ask ). 

I'll just call La Santisima eellogofusciouhipoppokunurious. 

( You can look it up. I'll wait. )"}
{"text":"Luckily we learned about the small taco shop on Groupon. We drove past the Glendale location and we thought it was closed. Had to call to double check the hours. Once we walked in, we were greeted by the manager or owner, very welcoming. He offered us some chips and guacamole. Came to find out there was no refill on chips and we had to pay for the guacamole...  I would have liked to enjoyed some chips throughout my meal, not just the first 10 minutes. Me and my boyfriend don't drink soda, so he offered a drink we took water. He brought us the water, but in a PLASTIC CLEAR CUP. Like the ones Circle K gives you. However the tacos we ordered were AMAZING. I had the Carne Asada street tacos. They were delicious. We ate and talked. about 20 minutes later, still no waiter for a refill. I had to get up and walk to the bar for more water. Finally the check comes... we paid in cash and we had decided what the tip was going to be. The change came and the waiter/manager/owner took some of the change as his tip... 

So if you can get past the bad service, getting offered something that should be free, small plastic water cups, then you'll have a great meal. We're going to go again, but to the other location."}
{"text":"Great  salsa bar
Gaucho taco and burrito are the best
And the Mahi Mahi 
Horchata is also pretty good
Definitly coming back"}
{"text":"We tried this spot last night for dinner. First impressions were not good. The lighting is horrible. The restaurant layout is over crowded and the lack of ambience is just sad. Now with all of that said, the food was delicious! The salsa bar was a lot of fun. We enjoyed trying several types of salsa while we waited for our food. Unfortunately, the waiter did not put our two courses in properly, so after waiting an hour, everything came at once. This was only after we asked about it. The waitress apologized and did comp our beverages. We are our entrees and wrapped up the first course to eat the next day. We will try it again and hopefully they won't be as busy or their kitchen will have their act together."}
{"text":"I love it here. It is the place that I take out of town visitors. I love the salsa bar. It is small and often you have to wait but I think that the food makes up for those things."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the salsa bar is awesome!  The seating situation however is a bit cramped.  The staff are friendly, and the food is definitely worth going for, but maybe consider getting it to go, or go on off hours.  The lunch rush is hard!"}
{"text":"Really great salsa bar, tacos, quesadillas and burros.  This is 'authentic' mexican; not Macayos.  
A few downsides though, it is really small & not really built for families or large groups; plus, I wouldn't park in the neighboring streets.  I got yelled at by one homeowner saying if they saw my vehicle again they're having it TOWED!."}
{"text":"My husband and I met up with some friends here for lunch on a Saturday. There is limited parking at the restaurant, so we had to park in the neighborhood next to the restaurant.
We went to La Santisima in Flagstaff last month, and had a great experience. There are still lots of great options here, but the service isn't as friendly, and the food in Flagstaff seemed to taste better. Not sure if the food here was not as great due to the long wait and several customers present today. 
Again, this place isn't bad, but I'm sure there are better options for Mexican food in the area if you look a bit more."}
{"text":"We came by for a late lunch, around 3-is and were served immediately-there were maybe 3 or 4 other tables seated. 

We ordered a horchata to drink, and it was one of the best I've ever had-with fruit and nuts added in. 

They have a salsa bar with a multitude of labeled salsas you can try, our favorites were the peanut salsa (creamy with a hint of spice), the tomatillo and the chipotle. 

We got three tacos and a enchilada style pork burrito. The pork was so tender it was falling apart"}
{"text":"Beau and I enjoyed a burrito and fried tortilla with chicken mole this past weekend. Ate late and avoided the dinner rush - there will be one for many a nite! Loved, loved the tasty salsa bar and down home service. Thank you La Condesa."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this local eatery. The food was great!! I had grilled chicken tacos with rice and beans. The horchata was exceptionally good, a must have if you visit this establishment. 

They also had a salsa bar with several different salsas to choose from. They were not spicy at all, but that is never a bad thing in my case. 

The service was friendly and prices were fair. The only downside is that it is very small and not enough tables for everyone. I would recommend coming here with your significant other and that's about it. Leave the family and kids at home or just take it to go. You might end up waiting a while for a table to clear. 

I would definitely be coming back to try different menu items."}
{"text":"Really Good Food! Had the shark taco, it was interesting. This is probably one of the best taco joints I've been to in phoenix."}
{"text":"Chicken Mole taco and Salsa Bar to D-I-E for...just sayin! sick happy!"}
{"text":"Always perfect!!! Everything is fresh and there's lots of salsas to choose from. Pastor and the quesadillas are my favorites but everything is good!"}
{"text":"It took forever to be seated, food took forever to come out by the time we received our food  was cold. 2 people in our group left due to the poor service and the fact that there apparent fish tacos weren't even cooked. The waitress clearly knew that the food was cold and still brought It out, when we asked her about it she admitted guilt to knowing it was cold. Overall terrible service, probably won't be coming to this location again off of 16th ave and mcdowell."}
{"text":"We came here twice on our visit to Arizona- the tacos are that good! Huge selection of very tasty tacos, awesome service at a more than fair price. They also have a huge salsa bar with a flavor for everybody. This place was great!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, I love the salsa bar. I haven't counted exactly how many salsas they offer, but certainly at least a couple dozen of them. And they're all great. Their margaritas are huge and definitely do the job, and the food very flavorful, though it does take some time to come out. The dining room is small and this place is popular, so do be prepared to wait. I've seen the line wrap clear around the building. Parking can also be a challenge."}
{"text":"La Condesa is an amazing little spot that has more than food, but charm as well. I really enjoyed the way that the restaurant was decorated; it definitely creates its own vibe, and it's not painted with a lot of loud colors (there are a ton of pictures of the decor if you look at the pictures). It's very classy to say the least.

The salsa bar is the first thing that I have to mention. It was overflowing with variety and flavor. Every time that I thought I'd found one that I liked, I tried another and pushed the previous aside. My girlfriend and I managed to polish of two baskets of chips without a problem or remorse because we had to try every salsa. The tamatillo and cilantro were two of my favorites in the mix. 

We also ordered the Mayan Conchinita Pibil tacos and the Aztec Tinga tacos. I'm usually hesitant about chicken on tacos because I usually always have bad experiences, but not here! The tinga taco was great. The meat was tender and well marinated - I could taste the sauce in every bite. The conchinita though is what really won me over. The pork was so good! Imagine the tenderness and juiciness or your favorite BBQ pork sandwich, but replace the flavor with a bevy of delicious Mexican spices and we'll pretty much be on the same level.

I'm pretty baffled that I didn't see a lot of my Yelp friends raving about this place. As a result, I will send this review out to you all (go try it =) ). This is a great little place that isn't pricey yet brings great flavor. The next time I got there I will be getting a quesa, no question, and hopefully I will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick bite to eat. i was told to come try the tacos.  its a really cute but very small place.  Clean and organized.  Very good salsa bar.  The seven chili and mexicana salsa were my favorite.  We ordered queso fundido...i liked it. One of my favorite dishes to try at new places. It did not dissappoint.  Only bad thing was...they could have given a few extra pieces of tortilla with the queso.  We tried the guacho and white fish tacos.  The guacho was excellent.  The white fish wasnt anything special.  Needs some extra seasoning or maybe a spicier sauce instead of the cabbage and white sauce.  I would come back and new stuff because i was pleased with my first try here."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and this place is amazing.  Like many, I am in love with their salsa bar which has at least a dozen different options for dunking your chips in.  While I wish they would provide bigger containers to fill your salsa in, it is meant to be a sampler and not a meal.  The choices are great to have and everyone will find something they like.  What keeps me coming back are the amazing tacos.  I order the shrimp and the mahi fish street tacos each time and they are some of the best in town.  Really great flavor and healthy portions.  Can't wait to eat again!!

A few particulars - this is a very small little place on 16th with mostly street side or residential parking, no actual lot.  During peak times, good luck finding a seat and the line at the register where you must order will leave you waiting a bit.  It's worth it for the taste, but just be prepared."}
{"text":"Love the Santisima Salad with chicken.  I'm not usually a salad person, but this is fully-loaded and quite a large portion.  I love using the spicy green avocado salsa instead of the salad dressing.  Also, love the unique flavors and wide selection at the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Good tacos not the best I've ever had. Then again I'm spoiled living in California. Margarita was also too sweet for me. Good way to kill two hours during a layover at phx."}
{"text":"mmmmmm.......the quesadillas are A M A Z I N G!!!!! who doesnt want it deep fried?! lol, also their salsa bar is delicious....try the pecan salsa!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving Mexican and wanted to try a new place so we decided to come here! Since all of the Yelp reviews talked about how amazing this place was we thought it would be great. But it was far from that. The service was fine, the food however, was not. I was charged $13.50 for a bean and cheese burrito al la carte, which wasn't on the menu, but it was more expensive then the majority of the burritos on the menu which included meat, quac, rice, salsa, etc. On top of that, my entire burrito was filled with just cheese. I literally had to unfold my burrito to find it was a tortilla wrapped around shredded cheese. No bean inside. Extremely disappointing especially when our order was so simple and the food was so over priced. Would not recommend to friends and would never consider coming back here."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! My favorite taco place, period. Oh my god. So many salsas! Herbs in their tacos!! Veggies in their tacos. Super super good. Everything is crazy good here, I super recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is well worth the drive for some amazing tacos! 

I love the fish tacos and my husband is a huge fan of the El Gaucho taco. 

This place is a great little shop in downtown Glendale. 

If you are feeling adventurous try the Chile En Nogada Taco... it will blow your mind!"}
{"text":"Being from Los Angeles I pride myself on having discovered some great taco shops and trucks. La Santisima was a Yelp driven decision right before driving back to CA.  The food was absolutely amazing..........an explosion of flavor that is second to none. You can taste the attention given to the preparation and the quality of all the ingredients. I'm going to always make time whenever I'm in Phoenix to stop in.........however the food is so special that I may actually drive back every so often for a fix."}
{"text":"Talk about a salsa selection! Don't even get me started about their Horchata! 
I take my friends from out of town to this place. Try it. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"My best friend first suggested we go here for the strawberry salsa, which is amazing.

I love tacos, but as a vegetarian, I hardly ever get to eat them. They have a few different types of vegetarian tacos here."}
{"text":"$5 extra to put green enchilada sauce over a burrito. The waitress didn't mention that so I was surprised to see it on my bill.
The margaritas were good."}
{"text":"So Sunday rolls around, and I'm hungover and day dreaming of someone to drop off a wheel chair for me to get around my house in the most lazy way possible. Then I see La Santisima on TV and I freaked out, and realized they're open on Sundays.

I managed to shower and get dressed in record time to make it there by noon. They tell me it's a 40 minute wait, and my stomach plays a symphony of sounds only okay in a hospital to be heard, I say \"that's perfectly fine\" and then go drunk sweat outside in the sun. 40 minutes went by and I prayed the tacos would be amazing and worth the wait.

We got seated inside and helped ourself to every single salsa at the salsa bar. There were a few that lit my threat on fire, but,  whatever, alls fair in love and salsa with this gringo.

I got the three taco plate with the mariachi loco, Cabo shrimp, and chicken tinga as well as a half order of the guacamole. I LOVED the guacamole, the tinga, and the mariachi... I felt the Cabo shrimp could've used something. But one thing that kind of was lacking was the service, not that I minded. I was content with my horchata to nurse my hangover. But our server forgot about our guacamole and I think the table next to us may have gotten the wrong order (the owner corrected it). I'll let it slide because they are crazy busy at all times."}
{"text":"Driving from Palm Desert to Albuquerque and wanted some awesome tacos. Came here after the great reviews on Yelp (Thanks, Yelpers!) and it was FANTASTIC.

My husband had the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco Plate. Tender and moist meat, he ate it with the Salsa Pecan from the Salsa Bar. The rice was OUTSTANDING. And the House Margarita was one of the best he ever had.

I had the El Gaucho Taco and a Carne Asada taco ala carte. Both ON POINT. And the horchata? ENORMOUS. The melon, berries and pecan at the bottom were such a treat at the end of a satisfying beverage.

I read some complaints about service. This place is small and every table was taken when we arrived. The two wait staff people were great. They were busy, the restaurant was full, and they were sharp. If you are in a hurry, don't come here. If you aren't and you are willing to stand at the bar with a drink and wait (which we did), it is ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT."}
{"text":"BEST chips and salsa in town!! I usually get the 2 taco place with rice and beans. DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Oh man, I need to go here more often! So delicious and that salsa bar! Heaven. Go early because this cute little restaurant is tiny and there is not a lot of seating. Have the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco- You're welcome!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The pastor tacos are out of this world. Like a fiesta in your mouth. I would recommend you trying them with the chipotle salsa  from the salad bar. I enjoyed every last bite I even wanted to lick the plate. The last time I had pastor tacos this good  I was in Mexico City.  This place is very small they have a little bar and it is dark. But when you have pastor tacos this good who needs light anyways;) the salsa bar was impressive I would recommend this place to anyone . I will be back with my mother, sisters, brother, aunt, uncle, Cousins neighbors friend :) AMAZZZINNNNGGG !!"}
{"text":"Gross and expensive!! Don't waste your time, money, or tastebuds!!"}
{"text":"Tiiiiiiny little place, but with very cool decor[ artists exhibiting their paintings], day of the dead theme.Not that it -matters-, because with the food that is served here, it could be all paper plates and plastic cups and I do not think anyone would -care-.
  We came here on a sunday evening, with a -very- hyperactive 5 year old in tow-as the restaurant itself is -very- small, even the smallest sounds he made felt like they would bring on an avalanche- or maybe I was just self conscious, as no one seemed to mind.
 The staff were very attentive and kind, the food arrived super quickly.
 And now onto the food-O M G
I had the Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken tacos- they were incredible.Rich, thick, delicious, amazingggggggly good. My son had Mayan Cochinita Pibil tacos[banana leaf roasted pork shoulder], and though usually I do not like pork, but from what I had of his, was delicious.
 Husband had Aztec Tinga[shredded chicken] bowl, with a fresh tortilla the size of a UFO saucer.
  There is a salsa bar with about 12-16 different, freshly made salsa;from pico de gallo to more exotic offerings such as strawberry salsa[the bomb], creamy cilantro salsa, creamy cashew .etc etc.All were super fresh and very tasty.

We will definitely be back-the mole sauce alone was worth the drive!"}
{"text":"A dump of a place with amazing food!
We came here before a concert at Gila River. I ordered a sangria and the waitress brought out a bottle. I took this as a very bad omen! The waitress however made me a delicious huge sangria at the bar when I complained. I ordered mole and it was amazing and moist on wonderful corn tortillas. The rice and beans side was also delectable. My husband ordered green chile burro and he also said it was very good. Maybe one of the most impressive aspects about this place was the salsa bar selection! They must have had 15 types of salsa. Some I've never imagined. The entrees were both under $10 so it was a cheap night out as well."}
{"text":"Really good food, decent sized portions and good customer service. A tad bit high priced, $30 for two people and only one beer. However the hotchata was so amazing it made it all worth it....there are nuts and fruit in it, what?! I can eat my delicious horchata as I drink it? Yes please."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! We were stoked to find this after flying in from out of town. Plenty of options for the vegetarian/vegans and meat lovers. Incredible salsa bar. Allow yourself time to look over the menu, definitely not your \"American Mexican\"."}
{"text":"I have updated my review after my last visit. They have expanded seating now so they are able to accommodate larger groups now! The service is still a bit slow but eating chips with the excellent salsa from the salsa bar helps pass the time."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I really like the food and the atmosphere.  It's a pretty straightforward place that's got a bit of flair tossed in.  So it's a good spot for the foodie and the not so foodie."}
{"text":"Went to La Condesa around 630PM on a weeknight and drove right by it a couple of times. No lights on outside at all. The parking was kind of scary as well.

On to the food. The Shark Taco was good until I ran into a huge piece that was so tough that I couldn't get my teeth to sink into it.
The carne asada tacos meat was a bit tough and cold.
The pork taco was pretty good and the meat was tender.

The salsa bar was the most interesting and yummy thing in the place. I loved the cilantro salsa the most.

If you go there you may want to pick a time when it's a little more busy. Not sure if my food was at its best since it was just before dinner? Not sure. I will give it another try though. Each taco was about 3.50 each. There are a lot better taco joints in the area though."}
{"text":"Well.  Hmm.  I suppose I should start by saying I have never had any issues with the food here.  It is always delicious and incredibly satisfying, and the salsa bar (especially the pecan salsa) is friggin' capital A Amazing.  I also really enjoy the atmosphere, and the servers themselves are great.

However, every time I visit I notice that the speed of service is slower.  Today was by far the longest wait, at almost an hour to order and get our food.  They've also recently expanded, so their dining area is roughly 3x the size it used to be (which definitely puts a dent on the already long wait time).

In the end, I'll keep coming back.  The food is worth it.  However, I really hope this isn't a precurser to negative changes for this restaurant.  It would be such a waste of a great thing."}
{"text":"Chicken mole taco on corn tortilla? YUM!! Top it off with one of their many homemade salsa options for a truly unique food experience! My favorites include the jicama salsa and the cilantro salsa!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Get the chicken mole tacos and don't forget to order a horchata!  Hayyy!   Delish and great service.  Oh, and load up on salsas because they are all really good.  Cute decor and amazing cuisine.   That is all for now................"}
{"text":"Place was super cool. Great food. Sat in the patio... Could've used some umbrellas for shade. Would've liked to see some drafts but nonetheless, the bottled beer selection was great. The wait staff seemed a tad unprofessional. But I'm sure with time and good promotion this spot can be a hit. My husband and I will definitely be back for the great fish and shrimp tacos :)"}
{"text":"It's Monday, people! What are you all doing here?

That's what I wanted to scream as I asked the gentleman at the bar how long the wait was.

There aren't that many tables stuffed into this small establishment, but apparently they really are that good that people are willing to waste time that they will never get back, to eat here.

So, I stepped outside and summarily informed my wife as to the long wait. I also reminded her that the other places she chose the past two days had prolonged delays for seating. I felt like I had lost precious moments in my life waiting to eat. On the upside, I was spending time with the only person that matters, so it was not even remotely a total loss in time. I was simply exaggerating.

So we waited outside, and tried to engage all the other customers. But, everyone was agitated for having to wait, and no one was wanting to engage in random conversation. In fact, the leaders of each party kept going back inside asking how much longer they would have to wait. I thought it was funny because we were all blocking the front entrance and we would've seen anyone that would've left. So, why bother asking how much longer? Duh!

I also thought how funny it was when a couple would leave, and the groups would go back inside and check in. Lemme do some basic math for you, okay? 2 people leave, and there are 10 of all you all! How many seats do you think will be available? :)

So, I go inside (not to ask how much longer), but I grabbed a menu (why waste time waiting in line and not be prepared), and I commandeer the only remaining flan in the house. I go back outside, and I tell my wife that I reserved the flan. She was a little perturbed because she didn't think I could do that! Well, everyone else is harassing the 2 servers (and one of them is pregnant), and I was just being polite and proactive. I kindly asked if I could have the last flan, and the gentleman set it aside for me.

So, about 50 minutes into the long wait, we finally get a seat. I must say, we really did experience how small this place was because as mobility was definitely impaired when you eat here. There is no chance that you won't bump into ANYONE! 

Let's get to the food part. The variety of Salsa that this place offers is amazing. Their unique flavors, and various combinations thereof are fantastic. You can mix and match them, and they just make you that much hungrier with every bite. 

We had the Sonora Carne Asada Burro and the Street Tacos. Additionally, we also had the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa. 

The verdict? Definitely worth the wait. The meats and the sauces were just phenomenal. Each and every bite was wonderful.

Then for the finale, I had my flan. By that time, everyone in our original group was seated and were still in various stages of being served with either drinks or their food orders being taken.

When the pregnant server lady brought out our flan, EVERYONE looked at it with envy as it really was a delicious masterpiece. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Then everyone wanted to order it, but alas, they all found out that I ordered the last one!!! (Evil eyes across the room)

More evil eyes came because I quickly learned how to multitask the server lady. While she was getting our flan, I went ahead and gave her my CC, asked for boxes for our leftovers, and also asked for refills.

So, while she was gone for quite some time preparing our flan, she left the only other server to take care of everyone else. When she returned, she had our box, our refills, our flan, and our check all done.

All we had to do was enjoy the flan, drink our refills, box up our leftovers, and sign the check / fill out her tip. 

And we walked out of there, while everyone was still wondering how to get served in here.

A few things that may detract from future experiences that you may want to be aware of. There is minimal parking, so you have to park on the side street but don't block the homes. The wait is long, and the service is slow unless you learn how to stack your requests so they get stuff done in one trip.

Otherwise, what a wonderful dining experience, even for a Monday night!

(Gosh, how I missed it when Monday Night Football was going on. I never had to endure this during those times)"}
{"text":"In Phoenix for 2 days so wanted some good Mexican food..this place is the best. Wanted to come again the next day but I would've missed my flight..get anything on the menu and it's good. Very clean, friendly waiters, a hole in the wall restaurant but definitely not bad..might need a bigger parking lot though as it's very cramped"}
{"text":"Ordered Uber eats from these guys today and mannn their tacos are bomb!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, and a wide variety of choices, among both the entrées and the salsas.  Good service.  Parking can be an issue, but the food is well worth that small hassle."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place, But I always seem to get bad service. Now that they expanded it seems worst. I came to dinner tonight and it took 15 minutes just to get water and chips. We finally were able to order and we both had the quesadilla with meat. We had to ask for napkins, silverware and more water. Our food was made wrong, didn't have what the menus said it did. There was tiny pieces of meat. Not sure I could even use the word tiny. There basically was no meat inside. It was over loaded with cheese. There was No flavor to it at all. We were never greeted on how everything was. So I never got a chance to change my order. I was just greeted with the check faster then the service in this place. I was extremely unhappy to pay for shitty service and bad food."}
{"text":"Totally worth the crappy parking situation here! My girlfriend and I came in on random weeknight for early dinner and the place was already full. Wow! Could be due to the limited seating or maybe because the food is terrific. Both? Likely. Chips arrived promptly straight from the oil pan - nice and toasty. And we helped ourselves to the salsa bar - which is completely fresh, creative, and whets your palette at the get-go! We loved the cilantro salsa and salsa mexicana the best. Zesty! The servers were quick to take our order despite being busy and minutes later my tacos de arrachera arrived. Sooo good! I mean. Wow! Meat was tender and juicy ....and the combination of spices and flavors was heaven. My friend ordered the Condesa specialty taco. Another winning ticket! Condesa has nailed the right way to make beans too. And..don't get me started on the deliciousness of the horchata. I've had me some horchata many places ..but this really rocked my world. Rocked it! 

Condesa, I have just two requests: Please do something about the sitting area so we can actually fit in this place. Also, please don't be out of flan next time I come in! Thanks!"}
{"text":"You are better than this Santasima. We have been loving your food for over 3 years but your service the last several times has been to the point of embarrassing.  We understand that servers and cooks come and go but if all you can do is offer excuses then don't offer anything. Just stay quiet and try to bring the delicious food you serve as best you can. 1 hour on a Tuesday night just to get chips and order a drink? 3 tries to get an order of mole tacos correct? Order a mojito and get a margarita? Anyone that has spent time in and around the service industry understands that some nights are tougher than others. This now makes 4 tries in a row where your service and professionalism were quite frankly....disgusting.  We love your food but until you can somehow prove that your attitude towards service and quality relationships has changed we will not be back. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great place, good atmosphere, a little on the small side but what they lack in size, they make up in flavor. The salsa bar was great and the food came out in less than 15 mins. There are no televisions or loud music to distract you from good conversation and good food. Parking is quite tight but don't let that detour you! A solid 8/10. Only \"complaint\" is the dish called the \"Mexican Flag\". If you don't like nuts and sweet dried fruit in your tacos, don't order this dish. Took us a little off guard lol 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"On an extremely hot June day,  I was in the mood for Horchata and had read about La Condesa's with the Fruit and nut pieces.   I enjoyed my drink sitting at the empty Bar area while I waited for my To Go.   Its worth just going for the Horchata.   I ordered One Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco as my Appetizer which was lightly battered and fried perfecty in obviously clean oil.    My Entree was the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa.  The 2 Quesas were crispy, pastry like and filled with Mole Chicken.  Oaxaca cheese was sprinkled on top and was a nice compliment .   Although, The Mole was just a tad bit too sweet, for me, I am looking forward to trying the other Quesas on the menu.   I was not familiar with \"Quesa's\" prior to my visit."}
{"text":"I came here for my Dads 50th bday. My parents had always told me they loved this spot but I thought it was okay. It has some really cool vintage features and i love the eclectic feel and the awesome mozaic statue out front. I just found it to be cramped inside. The service was disorganized and the food came out at different times for everyone. They also need some sound absorption inside its pretty loud. I hope it got better because it has great potential."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over a year now, ordering the same thing. The \"El Gaucho\" burro. Probably the best Burro on their menu... the Burro is amazing. Sadly, since coming here they decided to expand their restaurant. With clear notions that they have zero clue how to run that many tables. Seeing 8 people waiting over 40 min to be seated with more than 8 chairs available is not how you run a business. Considering I've run a successful restaurant with about 5 times the amount of capacity, one must consider an expansion before making one. Being understaffed and the kitchen being behind is absolutely zero excuse for letting people stand and wait to be seated while your kitchen catches up when the room for seats is available. I'm seriously appalled with this place after the last two times being here. If you're going to have the audacity to add $$ to your prices then justify it with the knowledge to know how to take care of your customers. Here's a tip. Tell your servers to seat people and offer them chips and perhaps a drink on the house if it is in fact the houses fault for being behind. Probably will not spend a dime here anymore which is sad considering I thought they had the best burrito in Phoenix. Get your kitchen together. Best of luck."}
{"text":"Food is good, really good. Service is atrocious. It should not take half an hour for a box so I can leave."}
{"text":"Today I got back with my girlfriend. And it happened to be Tuesday. So taco Tuesday right?my mom doesn't let me go out often unless it was prom or some sort of social gathering...but she's on vacation in Dubai, and I wanted to feel dangerous so I decided to take my chick to the hood and found La Santissima. 

The neighborhood that the restaurant is located in gave me a sense of impending danger and my girlfriend say she's into bad boys so I think I turned her on when We came into this joint. 

The food was OK. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just Mexican food, you know?

Walking out of this restaurant, I feel like a man for once in my life. I took a selfie with La Santissima in the background and sent it to my friends. 

When I was walking to my car a homeless person slapped the glasses out of my face...I mean I didn't need them to see, those were sunglasses. I probably shouldn't have worn them at night anyway. I just wanted to be cool and also I wanted to call the police but I sensed some heat coming from between my girlfriends legs so we ended up making out in the parking lot next to the shipping container. Nice placement."}
{"text":"Oh my god their salsas and margaritas! They're priced very reasonably. They have a killer selection of all kinds of fancy tacos that are very exciting. The staff is great, attentive but not pushy, knowledgeable about the menu. The decor is pretty too, I liked their posters on the wall. Clean, good food, many options, great service. No complaints!"}
{"text":"In our search for a more authentic Mexico City style taco, we came across this restaurant.  I'm happy to report that the tacos here are about as authentic as one can hope to find north of the border.  The Horchatas are fun and tasty as well.  I enjoyed the food and the small dank dining space brought back memories of the small eateries way down south.

So why only 3 stars?  The price is not right.  For a family of four (with two kids), we walked out with a bill of $55.  All we ordered was one round of tacos and some Horchatas.  Ouch.  Down in the DF, one can find better quality and quantity at a full-service sit down restaurant for 1/3 that price.  Maybe I'm looking for something that doesn't exist in Phoenix and I should just be happy to have this food at any price (or perhaps I just paid the \"Guy Fieri tax\").

No... I'll keep searching."}
{"text":"I have tried La Santisima only once and I am already anxious for Round #2! You know when the line is out the door that is the food is delicious. Every meal that was brought out, I wanted to try!! 

For my meal, I stuck with all tacos and tried the Carne Asada, Al Pastor and the Baha Fish Taco. They were all so flavorful with their own distinct tastes. All the salsas were different and I believe we tried all of them. They do have a pretty full bar so if you are in the mood, you can try it out. Many people were ordering the Horchata which I made the mistake of not ordering, so this will on Round #2's menu. I did stick with a Mexican Coke and it hit the spot!

I was very intrigued by the artwork, it made me feel like I was somewhere else outside of Phoenix. As I said, I cannot wait to return :)"}
{"text":"We stopped in for the first time based on a recommendation of another Yelper.

The chairs are extremely comfortable, but the artwork on the wall is very strange. I don't get it. It seems like they just decided to hang ugly paintings instead of actually painting the walls, they are very dirty. 

Our service was ok, but I assume she was new. I ordered 2 tacos a la carte and my boyfriend ordered a meal which comes with beans and rice. We then headed up to the salsa bar to accompany our chips. There were sooo many to choose from. I loved the green salsa and who would have known salsa made from radishes would actually be really tasty??

Our tacos were great, the beans didn't taste like they were from a can and the meat was cooked perfectly. The only issue I had with my lunch were the taco shells, I feel like they were a little too soggy."}
{"text":"This place is a local gem, and we were introduced to it by a local.  I hesitate to review it, for fear that the out-of-towners will find it.  You'd have to know where it is though, because the tourists are not going to accidentally stumble upon it.  It's in the middle of the hood in Phoenix.  The only thing setting it apart from the other old-school business fronts with barred windows is the giant mosaic Day of the Dead Catrina above the door.

Known as a \"gourmet taco place\" to locals, the menu also features burros and quesadillas.  Where else can you get a shark soft taco or a Mahi Mahi burro?  I have no idea, but you can get them here.  My husband loved his Mahi Mahi burro.

I had a more traditional Carne Asada soft taco.  All their flour tortillas are hand made, and fresh.  And did I mention the salsa bar?  About 20 different kinds of salsa for you to try, with the chips that keep coming to the table.  My favorite was the creamy cilantro one.  There are also peanut and pecan based salsas, so those with nut allergies, take note.  You may not expect nuts in your food, so pay attention.

Seating is limited, (maybe 10 tables) and the restaurant was full when we were there, for lunch, in the middle of the week.  If you have a group larger than 4, it would probably be wise to call ahead.  Parking is also limited, just the few spaces on the street in front.

The only slightly disconcerting element was the giant mural of Frida Khalo.  It's a little odd to be stared at by a giant portrait of a mustached woman while eating such wonderful food.

We liked it so much that my husband took my dad there.  My dad is a notoriously finicky eater (which means I probably came by it naturally), and he is still talking about it a week later.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Good food, bad service

First thing which is fun about this place is the salsa bar. Food is always good, simple, flavorful. I have been going here for many years. The drinks were added later and do not disappoint.

The food attracts lot of people, but finding parking is always an issue. Once you walk in, you quickly realize the noise level because of the way the place is constructed and set up is very high. Last but not the least, the service is always poor. We had rude servers where we walked out without ordering one time. That is the reason for 3 stars."}
{"text":"Love coming here! Their food is always fresh and I love snacking on their chips and salsa while we wait for our food."}
{"text":"We must have arrived at an odd time for them to be busy because the service was lacking. The kid was super sweet, but we waited and waited... and then waited some more. The food made up for the wait, but we were HANGRY when we got there and it almost got ugly. 

We got street tacos and they were awesome. We wanted to go back when we were flying back out of PHX, but we totally would have missed our flight and no tacos are worth that. 

That being said, one of the reasons we came here is because Yelp said that vegetarians go nuts here... and that was just not true at all. Veggie options left MUCH to be desired, so beware."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and it is consistently excellent. I have had a shark taco, mahi mahi taco and veggie taco. I had to bribe my meat-loving-high-cholesterol-fighting mother into \"splitting\" the mahi mahi and veggie taco's with me. She loved them, too! The horchata is like nothing I have ever experienced. Love the fresh fruit and nuts in it. The salsa bar is a tastebud orgy of sheer delight and a playground for foodies who love complexity of flavor. But best of all... for 2 tacos, a little side of rice and beans, chips, two BIG drinks, it was only $16! Plus, we listened to The Smiths and old Mexican folk music. This place rocks. Oh, and for those reviewers who were frightened by the neighborhood, get over it. I live 5 blocks in a historic neighborhood and it is as safe as a city can get. If you come for lunch, you just might take a walk a couple blocks up to get a poleta for desert. 16th st between McDowell and Thomas has successfully embraced its roots to create a truly positive cultural experience."}
{"text":"Things Evolve over time, so has La Condesa, There now is a big fancy bar and a somewhat different menu.

What really matters is that the flavor, ans salsas are still here.

I had a burrito with Mahi Mahi in it, it came loaded with spinach, mushrooms, cheese and rice. The cheese was a bit much but was still great at 10.59 with tax it should be.

What really mad it great was the salsas. Everything from a peanut salsa, to a strawberry to many of the classic favorites. I really enjoyed the roasted peepers and onions salsa.

Yes the inside is small and the parking is suicidal when you leave, but if you need a flavor shot give this place a try."}
{"text":"First time here for Mexican food, really like them food Oaxaca was so beautiful. will come again soon..."}
{"text":"Really great Mexican food in Phoenix.  I highly recommend that you visit.  Everything I tried was fantastic.  We shared the Queso dip with Chorizo (which came with thin \"tortillas\", which felt very traditional).  The 1/2 order of guacamole we shared was extremely tasty.  They throw in some dried cranberries to liven up the flavor and texture profile.  Per other Yelp reviewers' recommendations, we shared the giant horchata; 1/3 of an order was the perfect amount for me, and their twist of it with fruit bits was a nice departure from the traditional horchata.  

I ended up getting the gourmet Mayan Pibil taco and one of the food truck style tacos (but can't remember which protein).  They were both fantastic, and the perfect amount of food.  I really enjoyed the expansive salsa bar with over a dozen varieties of salsa.  It was fun to try most of them.  My girlfriend ordered the Quesa which was ginormous; with the chips and queso that we shared, she barely touched the quesa, it was so big, but it looked delicious.

I'd definitely come back to visit next time I'm in Phoenix.  I'm confident they won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Really good service, really good food and the Best Mango Margarita I have ever tasted. Highly recommend place to eat. 

P.S the paintings they have are amazing."}
{"text":"The salsa bar will invade your dreams. If I could I would bathe in their cilantro salsa."}
{"text":"have been here several times - love it.  authentic, good food always. their salsa bar rocks the house, great variety and savory choices.  had dark mole egg dish with black beans  LOVED IT"}
{"text":"Top 5 taco spots in my books. Double tortilla with ample amount of succulent meat with juice dropping on the plate. Each bite is mouth watering and goes great with my margarita at 11am after a hike. The salsa bar was impressive with over 10 different types. It made me want to salsa dance my way back to my seat and taco about how good the salsa was."}
{"text":"My favorite is the Al Pastor Quesa. A bit spicy and I don't normally do spicy but for this, I'll suck it up! Their yummy Horchata with fruits in it,  cools it all down for me  Great food!"}
{"text":"I love La Santisima!  I've been here a million times and never been disappointed.   The veggie tacos have so much flavor,  some of the best I've ever had.  The Puebla Quesa is amazing with the cashew salsa from their crazy huge salsa bar.  Their homemade jamaica and horchata are great.  Honestly there's not a bad thing I can say about this place."}
{"text":"My grand finally in Scottsdale came the evening I went to La Santisima.   I wanted to some good Mexican food before I left the west coast,  so I looked this place up and based on the Yelp reviews I made the journey.   It was about a 35 minute drive from my hotel in Scottsdale,  but well worth the trip.     The place isn't that big,  but it's very clean and pretty traditional.   The whole time I was there I heard bob Marley playing.   It was odd,  but cool at the same time since I expected mariachi music playing.   Anyhow,  me and my friends placed our orders and came to the salsa bar.   This had to have had the most variety in salsa that I've seen.   Tasted a few salsas for my chips and ordered a few alcoholic drinks which were fantastic.   I tried the peach margarita and my friend had the strawberry one.   The food was also delicious!  I had the asada burrito smothered and my friend had the chicken quesadilla.    The quesadilla is pretty stuffed and filling.   I would definitely come back and have lunch or dinner here in the future."}
{"text":"cool place! I really enjoyed myself at La Condesa Taco Shop. The food was fresh, and the place was very relaxing. 

The bar is impressive with unique styles of salsa. 

I ordered a shark taco and the cochonita pork taco. Great choice! The food was very tasty and fresh. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's a small location but HUGE in flavor. 
Make sure you try the quesadillas with carne asada.

The wait can vary due to its small size. I have waited for almost an hour. It was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Holy guacomole!! I found Mexican food heaven! We were so excited tasting everything. The Salsa Bar is awesome! We loved everything.  Great service. We couldn't even finish because portions are huuge!"}
{"text":"Another Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives spot. GREAT gourmet tacos. SO MUCH FOOD. They have a small bar, but we didn't have drinks. Just lunch on this Sunday. Chicken so good, You can get a 3 taco (mix and match) plate with rice and beans for $13.98.   RICE SO GOOD. 

Tried the horacha, not sure it's for me, but it was all gone before we left. Great prices, the waitress was very friendly. GREAT FRESH SALSA BAR. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I sure would love to give this place 5 stars. I promise myself Im coming back so perhaps you may see an update.

I have been hearing about this place even before I saw it on Triple D and I am not quite sure why yesterday was my first visit, I will tell you it wont be my last.

The menu is massive and somewhat confusing it's very wordy with such authenticity that it was just overwhelming. But it is primarily composed of appetizers, Lonchas, (sandwiches) Tacos, Burritos, and quesadillas. thousands of words filled that menu of 100 choices. I snagged a paper menu on my way out and will be ready next time.

Once sat we were greeted with a welcome, and some chips and directed to the salsa bar. Now The salsa bar has a reputation, and I feel it didnt live up to the hype. 4 of the 10 bowls were empty and it wasn't neat and fresh looking. I did try many of what was available  and they were great, if not super spicy!!!!! Strawberry salsa was a stretch but it wasn't bad, and the pico was good, just a basic pico, chipotle was tasty and there was another that was pureed and very hot that's was my favorite. The creamy cilantro could be epic, but some one thinned it out to the consistency of milk, if it was more of a creama I would still be there.

I ordered a burrito because I couldn't comprehend all of the taco choices, upgrades and extra charges for this and that. Tacos range from 4 to 10 dollars ea ala-cart. My choice of the Norteno with green chili was a hit. so very good with a great combo of moist roasted pork, rice, chile, sour cream and cheese. I didn't opt for the enchilada style $5 upgrade because I am fussy about enchilada sauce. I realize now I could have trusted this kitchen. I was a bit surprised to find my plate unadorned with anything but a fair size burro cut in 2. after a few bites all was forgiven.

My buddy loved his street tacos I tasted his beans they were amazing but the rice! The Rice was simply perfection, served on the side and just a little off white. There was something in that recipe caused those flavors to soar!!!! Most Cravable menu item.

It's a cool dining room with lots of quality art covering all of the wall space, along the walls were long naugahyde covered banquettes and loud chairs that sqauwked if you moved the feet across the floor. Felt pads are greatly needed for the chairs.

Restrooms were a mess and poorly stocked, and I could go on and on about that but it doesn't seem to do much good, owners and managers just don't seem to care about them any more, and that was the missing star in this review."}
{"text":"The food isn't as good as the location on 16th street. The Glendale location is either understaffed and can't accommodate busier days or the staff isn't that great. Either way my biggest complaint is customer service. We waited a good 15-20min and no one ever came to give us menus let alone take any drink order. We ended up leaving and I'm pretty sure no one even noticed. It's disappointing as I was really excited to see a location open closer to my house. The service is great at the 16st location but normally has a wait for seating as it is a smaller location. Needless to say, I won't be returning to the Glendale location.  I'd rather wait for a table and have better service and food."}
{"text":"The taco selection is amazing! Sure, I'll wait in a long line on taco Tuesday just to get my hands on the mix & match deal served with rice and beans. You can also swap out one of the two and get two rice or two beans. They also have a salsa bar and additional items you can top on your tacos, etc. NOM! If you're coming on a weekday (during noon time), I'd suggest you to grab a menu a overlook it while you're in line because the menu is huge and it gives you second thoughts on what you're ordering. There's also a water dispenser with cups near the register when you're waiting in line. 

Five stars because...
- Tasty tacos.
- HUGE menu.
- Vegan/Gluten free options (the section is pretty big).
- Friendly and excellent customer service.
- Salsa bar was clean and filled."}
{"text":"Great tacos and Mexican drinks.  What a hidden gem"}
{"text":"First of all, we love coming to this place, but last night service was really badddd as they only had 2 people waiting on approx 10/11 tables. It was a disaster for a Saturday night. . We tried to be patient and understand that they are short staffed and actually felt sorry for the servers, we even had to go get chips and water on our own because we were not waited at all.  Customers kept coming and we noticed that 2 different tables got their food before us even though we were there wayyyy before them, so  we asked the server what's going on with our food and stated that the kitchen was just grabbing tickets randomly.  One lady was  clearing tables while food was waiting to be served.  We were obviously disappointed!  Not sure what kind of management they have or I wonder if they even have one.  The servers are new ( that's  what we were told) and I am not blaming them for last night's disappointment,  the OWNER hopefully is reading this.  Will not go back ; as note to owner- Hire some help and train your staff .  We left after almost an hour of waiting.  No, we did not get our food after all that wait."}
{"text":"I won't beat around the bush. This was hands down the best Mexican food i've had in Phoenix so far. The salsa bar was incredibly varied and interesting, the street tacos at happy hour were delicious, the house margarita was perfectly balanced and the handmade quesadilla destroyed any preconception I had of what a quesadilla was supposed to be. Highly recommended. On top of that, staff was attentive and the atmosphere was unique, and unpretentious."}
{"text":"The burrito I had was the best burrito ever. I'm here on a 6 hour layover and was told to visit this place.  Very good food"}
{"text":"tasty menu with lots of variety, twelve salsas at salsa bar, seafood options, table service, handmade tortillas, giant basket of chips included free, no lunch rush.  all this AND priced similarly to america's taco shop, which can't hold a vela to this place."}
{"text":"As many have mentioned, this place is freakin fantastic.  I vote for La Condesa Shrimp tacos as my fav.  Best horchata I've ever had and eating the fruits and nuts when your done is a tasty dessert.  The Rabano (radish) Pibil salsa was so amazing I almost killed their supply of little cups going back for more.  That's one I'll be trying to recreate at home forever but will never get quite right.  Slightly sour, slightly hot, it's like a Mexican kimchee . . literally, I just drooled on myself thinking about it.  Viva La Condesa!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco shops in Phoenix, with a vast variety of salsas and menu items, new school and traditional tacos, and a deep-fried quesadilla. Yes, you read that correctly. Surely you'll have a heart-attack immediately after, but it's worth it. I almost think it's time for them to update locations, and get into something bigger since it's a nightmare to try and eat there around the lunch rush time, also its sort of rustic appearance doesn't quite match how good their food is. If it wasn't for recommendations from friends previously, it's the kind of place where you'd walk in, take a quick look, and walk out. Needless to say, don't allow that to deter you from exploring their menu, you surely wont' be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"It was ok but not great. We are use to authentic not Tex Mex or Southwest or whatever most places here in AZ are making. It seems so strange to be so close to Mexico but not be able to find really good Mexican food. Tacos are small. Salsa bar sounded good but mostly weird stuff like strawberry salsa. Parking is impossible. No pork green chili?! What the hell is green sauce? Yuck"}
{"text":"Hey! Anybody who liked the art in this restaurant should let the REAL artists know! Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez are LIARS and THIEVES, and those with actual talent are getting ripped off.

The owners and managers of this restaurant really need to do some research before giving money to supposed \"artists\" for their work. Countless news articles have now been written praising those thieves. The idea is deplorable.

Anybody who gives two craps about doing the right thing needs to show support for the artists who have had their work stolen and then displayed with credit given to another.

{"text":"Now we're talking! There is a reason this place gets rave reviews and multiple \"Best of\" awards. This authentic Mexican food, no Tex-Mex here. Incredible offerings and a blending of flavors you'll be hard-pressed to find elsewhere.

We've been to both locations, but for whatever reason, prefer the 16th Street location over the Glendale location. Same food, same wonderful service - just personal preference.

Tacos: Al Pastor, Carne Asada, Oaxacan Black Mole, Chicken Asado. All excellent, super flavorful, seasonings not overpowering and well presented. The mole is probably the best I've ever tasted. Hint of cinnamon/spices, chocolate & chilies. Just the right blending of flavors to bring you back for more. Looking for something out of the box? Try the Arabe Burro. Al Pastor pork with hummus lettuce, cucumber and even some Tzatziki! Very refreshing. They also offer quite a number of vegetarian offerings.

La Santisima also boasts a homemade salsa bar unlike any you've seen. This really gives the customer the opportunity to try flavors and you just may find you've discovered a new favorite! The salsa made with peanuts is very good - really! And don't forget the adult beverage - the hand made house margarita is very good, too!

Restaurant is very unpretentious. Small in size. Glendale location has parking in the rear, street parking in Phoenix.

Neither location is close by our neighborhood, but worth the drive for great food."}
{"text":"My wife and I use this as our go to quality taco spot. But I could spend all my time just sampling the salsas. Great midtown PHX spot. Parking is somewhat difficult if you come during busy hours but don't let that deter you."}
{"text":"I recently enjoyed delicious beef and chicken tacos as well as the plentiful salsa bar at La Santisima. The establishment is small and the service proved acceptable. If I lived in the area, I'd likely explore their menu on a more regular basis."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and I am in love with this place. The food is amazing and the salsa bar is sooooo good."}
{"text":"Truly great tasting food and cocktails are amazing.  The restaurant itself is very small and they should figure out another layout.  The wait staff that day was sort of mediocre."}
{"text":"Obsessed with the white fish tacos! I've never really liked fish tacos but they've won me over and salsa bar is amazing! Go there hungry- you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great food and salsa bar. Get there early or late for lunch. I've been there five times had different items each time and loved them. Mole is awesome."}
{"text":"My new favorite medium scale Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. 

Very high quality and simple. 

The oxacan cheese, fresh herbs and spices, grilled chiles, the 10+ salsa bar options and the homemade horchata with berries and nuts are all you need to know. Vegan and vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"WOW, DELICIOUS FOOD!!!!! 

Sauces were okay...didn't come across any I loved, but then again I only tried about 5 different flavors. Well, the cilantro sauce would be the best out of the 5 I had tasted.

Their quesadilla was indeed their own signature style, It was very appetizing, with their golden brown crunchy exterior layer all around, I give it 5 stars!!! 

The Fish tacos were delectable, and they were not scarce on the portions either! small & crowded interior, so we ordered to-go! but next time, if we decide to dine in, I'll be sure to sample all their sauces!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Phoenix!
Went with my family, we are total foodies and were blown away by the flavors! Service was also very good."}
{"text":"I could have made a meal just from the chips and the great variety of salsa at the salsa bar.  Strawberry and peanut salsa were unique and expertly crafted.  They could have seemed gimmicky but the flavor was no joke and went great with the rest of the meal.

The salsas set the bar high while waiting for my tacos and the tacos had no trouble clearing that bar.  I had 3 different tacos and wish I had room for about 15 more as every variety sounded good to me.  I'll definitely be back to work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Luckily, Kevin H. put this place on my radar and actually took me there a few weeks ago.  I've been back a couple times now as it is dangerously close to home and so delicious.  

The cilantro salsa is perfectly awesome.  Your taste buds will love you.

The veggie tacos are everything I could ever ask for- I don't miss meat when I eat them and that is awesome sauce.  The beans are probably loaded up with things a vegetarian shouldn't be eating, but lets pretend that isn't the case and just enjoy them.

Service is kind of odd, but I really don't care because the food is amazing.  Go- go, now."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and happened to see this restaurant on Diner's Drive In's & Dive's, and it was just as good as Guy said it was!!! The food is ridiculously good, super unique but still authentic. You have to wait for a while to get the food, but it's so worth it because of the quality. Make sure to try the Horchata."}
{"text":"I went multiple times during my time in Phoenix and luckily did not have to wait too long each time. The streets tacos are hearty and well seasoned. The best part are all the salsa options you get to choose from and the included chips that come with your order. It is really fun trying all the salsas and they go great with the food. The margaritas are also pretty delicious based on the sips I had from others. The horchata is pretty unique with the added fruit and is not as creamy as other preparations but is still refreshing!

A nice spot for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"All delish! Burro Taco recommended by waiter was a great choice. The fish taco was excellent as well as the shrimp taco. Salsa is done right! Can't wait to visit again! Great atmosphere and service. The decor is interesting!"}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars I would. It literally took us almost a whole to get our order taken. At 5:30 finally after we were asked what we wanted to start with, the restaurant ran out of guacamole, which I just don't understand. I don't even know who our server was because One girl helped us but the whole time she did it she rolled her eyes and complained how she wasn't supposed to be our server. Very poor service very poor management. She did apologize at the end for the poor service but I really think that we could've at least been accommodated with a free drink or a free dessert. We were so excited when we saw that guy from the Food Network came here, but we left so disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of tacos and salsas. Reasonable prices and great service. I have to come back and try all of these options and have a margarita."}
{"text":"Awesome guac, if you like it fancy.  Really great tacos, small quaint dining room.  Reeeaaaallllyyyy long wait."}
{"text":"Was craving some tacos and saw the reviews here so decided to give it a try. Place is a total dive, but in a charming way. Got the chicken mole tacos and they were outstandingly good. Also got a La Condesa Taco w/ chicken and thought it was just okay. I asked to make them really spicy and they definitely had a bit of a kick to it. The tacos are huge so I was full. The salsa bar is pretty interesting and has a diverse selection of salsas (try the peanut one, it's very good). Service was friendly and the prices are really fair."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood!  Had the marlin tacos and the carne asada, and they were some of the best I've had.  Great atmosphere.  They serve beer and margaritas so they are perfect as a late afternoon destination.  The salsa bar is well equipped with different tastes from all over Mexico, and the owner Felipe is a food guy at heart.  He made it a point to come over and say hi and introduce himself.  We ended the meal with a Horchata to go, and I have to say I couldn't have left any happier!"}
{"text":"Tacos. Ammmaaaziiiing! Try cochinita pibil!!! Try the salsa Mexicans for sure and lonche w cochinita pibil fantastic too. It was a great experience"}
{"text":"Gourmet tacos!  Try any two gourmet tacos you will not be disappointed. These tacos aren't your regular small street tacos these are some serious tacos. I tried the la santisma taco with arrachera carne and the shark taco. Both were incredible. Really like the shark taco with its sauce.  And the santisma taco was right on. Real Mexican sodas with real sugar straight from the glass bottle. And don't forget the salsa bar. Seriously, so many salsas to choose from. Try them all, I did and simply went back for those I liked, no loved!  Oh. Did I forget even the rice and beans were good and I only know this because they mistakenly added them to my plate, the chef was being generous the waiter said. Thank you I said!  These are definitely better the average rice and beans."}

{"text":"I ate here a while ago but want to leave a raving review as I've told more people about this place than any other restaurant. My boyfriend and I ate here and we both can't wait to go back. Although the wait was long, and I almost died of hunger, I would go back any minute. The food was amazing and hands down the best Mexican food I've ever eaten. I hope they stay tiny, don't expand and ruin it so I can go back and eat here for years."}
{"text":"Probably the BEST tacos I have ever had. 
Impressive selection of salsas.
Lot's of character. 
Awesome staff."}
{"text":"Just moved to Phoenix, and am SO HAPPY that we live near La Santisima. The salsa options alone make every trip back well worth it. Highly recommended if you like great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Amazing food & the absolute best horchata that I've ever had! The atmosphere is great including the paintings inside and new calavera they put outside. The food is always fresh and there's a variety of different salsas to choose from at the salsa bar. Great little place to have around the neighborhood, great addition. :)"}
{"text":"The -1 star is only for the atmosphere, bad lighting and sound system (with loud music). Their veggie tacos were tasty, with fresh tortillas and yummy salsa. Tasted like Abuelita was in the kitchen. Our server looked like he wasn't a day over 18, but seemed like he had years of experience, and very nice. Almost hope they don't spruce up the place, it would be difficult to get their delicious food!"}
{"text":"YOU MUST GO HERE. The salsa bar was so good! I kept getting up to try pretty much every one, and refilled on the strawberry salsa! My waiter helped me pick a combo if three different tacos and I really appreciated it because they were so good! Don't be deterred from the image of this place, its local, its homey and probably one of the best mexican restaurants I have been to - and I am from Texas!"}
{"text":"Great place for food. The décor is very nice. The bartender here makes the best Margarita as I've ever had. I like that it's not typical tacos or typical Mexican food. It is very authentic Mexican food from central Mexico."}
{"text":"Be prepared to squeeze in close to your neighbors, but the food is certainly worth it! The salsa bar is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers!  We were in town Sunday - trying to find something new and close by.  Yelp provided the answer - over 1,300 reviews with a score of 4 1/2 stars ... gotta do it.  SO GLAD WE DID.

5 of us showed up for some Gourmet Taco's.  A bit of a wait - but not bad.  Not a lot of room to sit/wait inside - and it could be a hot wait on the sidewalk out front on a summer day - but - once we were inside and seated...Happiness ensued.

A pretty comprehensive menu - various taco preparations - from a traditional Barbacoa (Mariachi), Chicken Tinga, a Sonoran Arrachera steak, to my choice - the Sonora Carne Asada Burro.  Wonderful!  Very flavorful, tender and moist meat.  My dining companions had a variety of taco's and quesadillas, and everyone was completely satisfied.  Lots of wow's every time someone tried something new.

The salsa bar was great - only complaint - I like to really dip my chips, and the small cups provided just enough room to put the tip in, and just enough for a taste.  They were all very tasty - some much more hot than others.  Loved the sweet/slightly hot fresh mango salsa.  I could eat just a bowl of that and be happy!

Too full for deserts.  Well be back again for sure!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food, service was lacking but worth the crappy service to get the food.  They need more staff."}
{"text":"Salsa bar is HUGE but not maintained.  I sampled 5 tacos. None were that great. I was disappointed by this place. Service was 4/5. They really need to clean the place and the salad bar more often."}
{"text":"Chicken tinga burros and grilled zucchini, oh my!

So I've been here a few times and figured it was about time to give it a review.  It's easy to pass by this as it's squeezed in between a closed down car repair shop and a Mexican party shop, complete with pinatas hanging outside.  The only giveaway is the fact that however nice your ride is, there's at least two other vehicles here way classier parked beside you.  You open a large wooden door to a cacaphony of fantastic smells, dizzied by this olfactory blast and pupils adjusting to the darkened lighting, and stumble to find an open table to sit down at.  The furniture is all heavy wood an iron, a signifier of the quality of the place, but the placing is not the best, leading to endless bumping and apologies, the only thing that could be considered a bad point to this place.

If you love salsa, this place hosts a bar with at least ten different types of salsa including ones made from ground pecans, which became addicting after the initial shock of eating salsa made from nuts.  It's hard to find for those coming with quite an appetite I recommend the Santos Plate.  It's a choice of one taco, one burrito and a generous helping of grilled zucchini.  

I tend to slather anything I get in salsa to raise the spice level, the chicken tinga in a burrito does not require it at all, by the end of this huge burrito I was starting to feel sweat droplets forming but I couldn't pull away from how delicious it was.  The taco choice recommendation is the pork shoulder cooked in banana leaves, the flavor was amazing and the red vinegared topping added just the perfect amount of sweet and sour.  I'm not a big fan of chocolate but if you are, the mole taco will definitely hit those key notes with you as well.

I've never personally ordered the horchata but one of my co-workers did.  It only comes in one size, LARGE.  Be very thirsty and take your insulin beforehand.  Thirty-two ounces awaits of what was originally horchata, now spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg, ground pecans and strawberry.  Definitely not your average rice drink.

Overall you can't go wrong here, everything is made fresh, hot and delicious.  This place has become a monthly ritual spot, it should be for you as well."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times now. I love this place. The name has changed, they've been serving alcohol for a while now, there's a new location in Glendale (I need to go), and the menu has expanded but isn't quite represented online yet. Even the physical menus can be different. The one I had had a few more items on it than my friends'. The horchata is still the best I've ever had. The margaritas are so freaking good.

I tried the marlin taco that wasn't there last time I visited. I love trying things I've never had before. Marlin is an odd fish. Their preparation makes it look and taste almost like pork. It's just... different. Still good though!

My friend got the veggie burro. She said it was pretty tasty, but a little on the bland side. We agreed that it can be hard to make vegetarian food flavorful at times. She liked the salsa bar because she could add a different flavor between bites.

They get slammed on weekends. I was here at 7pm on a Friday. They need more than 2 people serving and clearing on weekends. When every table is packed there's almost no room to move. Getting to the salsa bar can be pretty awkward."}
{"text":"I've also been to the Glendale location but this was our first experience with La Santisima. My wife and I just can't get over the food and salsa bar here! So many amazing flavors of salsas to choose from. My favorite salsas here were the Guacamole salsa (has some heat) and Mexicana salsa (salsa Mexicana, lots of lime flavor).

I had the Dogfish Shark taco based on reviews, as well as the filet mignon taco.
I wasn't overly impressed with the shark taco, there weren't any flavors that distinguished it from just a regular fish taco. However the filet mignon taco was incredible. The beef was cooked medium and tender, and the dressing/fixings was an avocado salsa with cranberries. It was delicious. There was way too much food to fit onto the tortilla (a good problem to have) so the tip is to eat a lot of the filling, then try to roll it up as a taco.
The one sad thing to note was that they ran out of grapefruit juice so the house margarita wasn't as good as I've had it previously. But you definitely need to get the house margarita, it's so good. Plus it's only $5 during happy hour!

Had to ask for a water refill since the server wasn't paying much attention to our water status. That's the only constructive feedback I have."}
{"text":"My wife found this place based on reviews while she was traveling earlier this month. It just so happened that we were already coming back to this area for vacation, and this was the first place we ate at in Glendale because she previously had such a good meal.

So my expectations were very high because it's all she has been talking about.

And I was not disappointed! First of all, the salsa bar is huge and offers so many diverse flavors. Pecan? Peanut? Radish? Along with the more traditional salsas. Here's a tip, try mixing the Pecan with the Rabano Pibil (Radish) for a great combination. My personal favorite was the guacamole salsa, it definitely has some heat.

I had the El Goucho Quesa and it was amazing. It's like a deepfried quesadilla, with amazing argentine seak with tons of other goodness inside. The Oaxaca cheese is so good sprinkled across the top along with avocado slices.

Another thing that beat my expectations - the house margarita. A little sweeter than the usual margarita (flavor comes from grapefruit juice) and if I weren't driving I would have had 2 during the meal."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out, which isn't their forte. I was not offered a seat, nothing to drink, and generally had to figure out whom to address to place my order. There is a salsa bar, but when I got there - around dinner time - the salsas were mostly gone. There are at least two salsas worth writing about, but there were no cups/lids to take the salsa with me. Upon request, they provided me four one-ounce cups with four lids, so I did get to try a bit of four types of salsa, period. The fish tacos were odd, but the smoked swordfish actually tasted yum. NOT for $9+ though, which is part of the reason for the low star review. Overall, you couldn't convince me to give this place a second try. Bad service - the servers/staff seemed too busy to help (service is a biggie). Recommend you go into the insurance business with your people skills."}
{"text":"My definition of Central Phoenix ended at around the 12ths on both sides, but this place and Urban Beans have taught me the folly of my ways.  Condessa is a simple and beautiful spot, serving a different, more expansive menu than most of the other Mexican restaurants I've been sampling.

First impressions won me over on first step in, I am in love with the Dios los Muertos art aesthetic and they have some beautiful works adorning their walls and doors.  The self-described gourmet menu was enticing, many selections I've never seen in person, only read about in my food travel readings, so I was intrigued.  I really wish I was more hungry, I settled on the Queso which was recommended by my server.

The food takes a bit of time to prepare, but that does give you time to enjoy the salsa bar, which this day included 10 varieties including strawberry, chipolte, a creamy cilantro, guac, pico, can't remember them all.  When my Queso came I was a bit shocked by it's size and relativity to fry-bread, not that this is a bad thing.  The pork inside was unbelievable, comparable in portion size and taste to that of much more expensive places.  Fried cheesy porky goodness, topped with rotating different salsas, each bite was another slice of heaven.

My gripes:  I have much respect for the work they put in to make this food outstanding, but they are shooting themselves in the foot with the plastic silverware,  cheap baskets and togo cups.  I know doing dishes is annoying, but you need to match your great food with great accoutrement.

After writing this, I'm going back today.  Yum."}
{"text":"This is soooo much closer to where I live than the original location. Awesome :) I'll be back. The only kink is service and signage. The people are new and are being trained so that should improve. I swear one of the servers also works/worked at the original. This location is just as hard to spot though. Small building, but plenty of parking in back.

I'm a huge fan of the original. Been there multiple times. I was much more impressed by the mole being served here, but not so much the dogfish. It was still good, but seemed to be more batter this time around. Cabo shrimp and marlin are good at both locals.
Two taco plates with rice and beans and two horchatas = $25-30

I finally have enough experience with these restaurants to complain just a little bit.
1. Go back to putting the rice and beans in cups or bowls please. I am begging you! I'm so tired of my tacos getting soggy from my beans spreading across my entire plate. Get plates with ridges and sections or something. Something! Anything!
2. The music IS REALLY LOUD at both locations. I'd like to not have to yell at my dining partners.
3. No pecans in the horchata anymore? Did I miss this menu change or was it just a hiccup at the newbie?"}
{"text":"I am beyond picky when it comes to Mexican food, having grown up in Phoenix. I eat here weekly since I work down the street. The meats are seasoned perfectly, the salsa bar is amazing (try the creamy cilantro), everything including the guac is fresh and the price is right. Waitstaff is very pleasant. Eat here."}
{"text":"What a great find. Lots of salsas you never have seen before. Lots of menu choices & the margaritas are excellent. A great lesson to not judge a book by its cover! If you want a change to the traditional tex-mex, this is the place. It's also near the airport, so it was great to get something quick, delicious, and convenient."}
{"text":"Love LaSantisma starting with the amazing ceramic tile sculpture over their sign to their mmm Margueritas, their food in general, and best of all, their guacamole often made with mangoes."}
{"text":"This place is good for tacos! I think they way they pack them might be a little too heavy for me but I'm sure a lot of people appreciate it. More bang for your buck to some people. They have a salsa bar which I loved a lot. Different flavors... nothing wrong with that. Our service was a bit slow though. It took for ever to get our margaritas which wasn't the best. I only order the classic margarita which is usually my favorite but maybe they have something that they are known for. I'll def be back one day. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Well this place is stinkin delicious.  The service is a bit slow, and the restaurant is not that big, so expect a crowd- but the fresh food definitely makes up for anything the former was lacking.  We enjoyed the specialty burrito with steak, and it was mouth wateringly good!  The salsa bar is a nice touch, and everything tastes really fresh and well made.  I'll be sure to stop again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town.  Hands-down.   A locally-owned, authentic gem!  The mole is phenomenal, and you can have it with either chicken or shrimp.  The house margarita has a lovely blend of lime and grapefruit juices and it just plain delicious.  There are tons of veggie options here that are not just lame, meatless dishes.  The La Condessa Veggie Taco has a mix of Oaxacan cheese, mushrooms, smoky poblano peppers, onion, spinach and garlic...and it is to die for.  The all-you-can-eat salsa bar adds a fun touch."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE place to go for authentic tacos. LOVE their salsa bar too.

I always get their santisma burrito with shark. Grilled (special order so it's not on the menu, but just ask and they will accomodate). I feel like it brings out the flavor of the shark better.
I also love getting their tacos (any of them) with grilled shrimp (also special order and not on the menu). 

I just don't like deepfried stuff haha but this place is amazing.

Everyone says their guac is great but I think it's overrated. I love that it's chunky and tastes fresh.. but it's sometimes lacking in flavor because they make this in bulk. When making things like this in bulk, it can be hard to evenly spread the ingredients. Skip the guac and invest in another taco!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place given all the great reviews, but after eating here last night, I really don't understand the hype. I ordered the mix and match tacos, and they were so flavorless I almost couldn't eat them. Honestly the most bland Mexican food I've ever had. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"I spent only a few hours in Phoenix waiting for a flight and came here for a quick dinner. I will never forget this place... Great tacos and the salsa bar was really fun. Tried all sorts of salsas I'd never had before. Some interesting nut ones"}
{"text":"Soooooooooooooo good. Packed even at 2pm and people continuing to come. Expect a wait but it's worth it for sure. I got the 3 street taco plate with rice and beans. Chicken, al pastor and beef. All delicious. The rice and beans were great too. We also had a half order of guacamole which was phenomenal and more than plenty for 2 people.  The salsa bar has a crazy variety and we didn't try any we didn't like. Try this place out. It's not in the best part of town but who cares.  If you're about good vittles you will leave full and happy."}
{"text":"I am a bean and cheese FANATIC and this place is it! I will absolutely be back and the servers were exceptional as well!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa before your meal: Yes
Self serve salsa bar: Yes
If you are looking for some daytime tacos this is the place to go. Tica tacos, carne asada, cochinita pibil, shrimp and even shark tacos. Vegetarian choices also available. If you love real horchata you'll love it even more here. They have the best horchata ever with fruit and crushed walnuts. This place is perfect because you can walk off the calories at Papago Park, Indian Steele Park or check out the sites downtown which are all within 10 minutes or less away."}
{"text":"The beans were watery and too salty for my taste.The rice is plain white rice just as you see in the picture with corn no flavor to me, both rice and beans were warm not cold.The salsa bar is decent. Not a fan of the cilanto cream salsa or guacomole sour cream salsa. I love simple good cooked foods. They do have vegetarian foods."}
{"text":"We had the mix and match taco plate. I had the Jamaican Rose Shrimp Taco, the La Santisima Specialty with Shrimp, and the Tamarindo Mahi Mahi tacos. They were very inviting. The chef infused so many ingredients to ensure that when you took a bite into the taco all the flavors burst beautifully onto your pallet. I also particularly liked the texture of the tortillas used to wrap the creative goodness of the tacos. My wife and I also shared the poblano queso. It was also rich with a vastness of melted cheese and poblanos that tasted as if they were dried weeks ago and aged perfectly. We will definitely be back....numerous times!"}
{"text":"This place has gone done hill, and their prices are ridiculous now. Today is the last time I think I'll be patronizing this joint. I'll miss their amazing salsas, but not the dirty tables and floors, or or the really loud music, or the slow service or the ridiculously overpriced food items. Too many choices when it comes to yummy Mexican food in this town, and this place got a little too big for their britches IMHO. You gotta try harder people! I hate when places get popular like this, and decide it's cool to gauge people and not put their best foot forward."}
{"text":"Waited a while to get our order taken 4 tables total of 9 people in various stages of dining.  Service was bad food was average and a little on expensive side.  Had high hopes... Will not return nor recommend."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars. But LS deserves it-- amazing, life changing food. Good atmosphere and nice staff. But the food is phenomenal. They have 30+ different kinds of tacos alone-- even vegan ones! But the clincher is they do protein style tacos. So low carb people delight!!! They wrap their tacos in crispy Oaxaca cheese and omg it's amazing. I'm not on a low carb diet and I still order it. Yum! I'm Hispanic so horchata is staple. But their horchata is out of this world. I stop by just to order one and leave. Try it. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best choice of tacos from different regions of Mexico! They even have vegetarian and vegan tacos! The simple bean burrito (bullet burro) is to die for. My favorite option they have is that you can order the tacos \"protein style\" where they come literally wrapped in ooey delicious Oaxacan cheese-- keto friendly if you stick to the meats etc! Homemade salsa bar with 8-12 different salsas. And holy balls, do yourself a favor and order an horchata. It's like nothing I've ever had before and I want to be submerged in it when I die. So. Good. I'm craving it now, as I review.

 The atmosphere and staff attitude is a little lax but I don't go to a restaurant for that-- it's all about the food."}
{"text":"When you come here, the best thing you can do is order a plate of tacos, more tacos then you can comfortably eat (but you'll eat all of them, damn it) and build a fortress with the salsa cups.  There are so many different kinds of salsa here.  Just keep going back until you have a cup of each different kind and stack them so you create a barrier and no one can see you stuff your face with that delicious food.

Don't be afraid to wipe with your sleeve, because no one will see you.... the wall of cups of salsa will be blocking you.  Eh?  See, I think ahead."}
{"text":"Best food  everrr and the place it is amazing..."}
{"text":"Can fill up on the salsa bar and out of this world horchata alone! The street tacos and bullet burrito are all amazing. Margaritas are mixed well."}
{"text":"They seemed to fix the sewage smell but the salsa is still better at the Glendale location."}
{"text":"Great local place.  The food is amazing, but the service was only ok.  Great place to go with friends, but this would not be my first date location."}
{"text":"I've driven by La Santisima many times but never stopped in. The decor on the outside intrigued me so I Yelped it and was impressed by the reviews. We decided to give it a shot on my moms birthday with a party of 5. We were seated quickly got our chips and drinks and started trying the various salsas from the salsa bar. It was pretty cool having more than a few choices and some were really good.

There is almost to much on the menu. All 5 of us had a hard time deciding on what to sample. I decided to go with the shark quesa. It did not disappoint. It was great. All 5 of us enjoyed our food immensely and were talking about when we could get together to go back. 

The service was good. Not great but the one waitress was pretty taxed because of how busy they were. We ordered my daughters quesa with no sour cream and it came out with sour cream. It was noticed by the waitress as soon as she put put it down though and she took care of it. My wife's tacos and my daughters quesa were brought out quite a bit later than the other 3 meals. No clue why the tacos took so long but it is what it is. Also it took a bit of effort to get the chips refilled and I still haven't got my drink refilled. 

Notice I've mentioned that we had a party of 5 quite a few times... La Santisima automatically adds 18% gratuity to parties 6 or above. Well when we got our bill it was marked as a party of 6, with gratuity added. The waitress took my card, ran it, and low and behold the itemized copy that showed the added gratuity was gone when she brought the customer/store copies back. You know, that's the part when you fill in the tip. If I wouldn't have noticed beforehand I would not have had any idea that the tip was already included. Because we didn't have a party of 6, only 5. I kind of felt like someone was trying to get over on me and get double tipped. Just a suspicion. I don't tend to be the conspiracy theory type but it just seemed a bit fishy to me. 

I would definitely go back. The food was fantastic, 5 star territory, but the service snafus and the gratuity mystery cost them a couple stars. When I do go back, and I will, I'm just going to keep a really close eye on my receipt."}
{"text":"We arrived at 11am and left at 1:10pm.  The food came out extremely slow (12:30) and service was very slow.  The food wasn't bad, but not worth the wait to eat.  The Margs were good, but again, not worth the wait.  The salsas were good and liked the variety.  It was our first time there.  It wouldn't come up in our minds to go eat here again."}
{"text":"Oh man, this was a good dinner! There were rumors about La Condesa: awesome salsa bar, tasty cheap tacos...I am glad to say that both of those rumors are TRUE!

I had a chicken mole taco which had just a couple too many red onions on it (which were easily dispatched). The mole was rubbed into the chicken rather than glooped on top, so the fragrant smokiness really soaked into the chicken. I liked this taco even better with a spoonful of the juicy strawberry salsa on top.

I also sampled the carne asada burro. Simple handmade flour tortilla (I could eat them plain for days), filled with black beans and beef. The meat had a deep flavor and was slow-cooked tender. Again, a dollop from the large assortment of salsas, this time the creamy cilantro, made good taste great.

My calabacitas were grilled just right: nice char marks, but with some body still left to the slices. 

La Condesa only loses a point because the chips could have been better (fresher) and the parking in front is rather harrowing. Otherwise, it is going in the regular rotation. I hope they have t-shirts sometime soon with some of the amazing artwork!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The food was very authentic which is rare to the Phoenix area. We look forward to trying everything on the menus."}
{"text":"La Santisima has unique taco combinations that you will not find at just about all of the fast Mexican-American food joints. Their salsa bar is the best that I've ever had, allowing the patron to make some delicious flavor combinations! Definitely go here!"}
{"text":"Visited La Santisima for first time last week w/sister for lunch,I had el pastor sandwich, FABULOUS, going back 10/3 w/5 friends for dinner. Servers are very knowledgeable, easily explaining the menue,atmosphere very comfortable, CAN'T WAIT!!

{"text":"La Santisima is a Mexican Restaurant with a unique menu that features many tacos some interesting and hard to find Mexican Foods like the Stuffed Chili with Walnut Sauce and the Mexican version of stuffed calzones called Quesa. Another one of the other unique features is  a very large salsa bar that has about 15-20 different salsas to try. The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating and it's done in a really cool Day of the Dead kind of theme. This location is in Old Town Glendale and they have their own parking lot.

I've been here a couple times since my first visit and a few things I loved before have been slightly different so I have to get that out there.

The Marlin Taco I had on my first visit tasted very similar to the Marlin Tacos I had in Mexico. They have a unique smoked flavor and were delicious with a similar flavor. On my most recent visit the Marlin Taco was still good but lacked the smoked taste and had little flavors on it's own. It was still good and packed with a very generous amount of filling but not the same.

I also tried the Whitefish taco. It was also packed with a generous amount of crispy battered fish and lots of cabbage dressed with a very mild cilantro dressing. It was good but also needed to be kicked up with things from the salsa bar. I added a squirt of lime juice, a little cilantro salsa and some strawberry salsa and then it was really tasty.

For me and the majority of people out there two tacos is all you can eat because they are double shelled and fully packed.

My husband had a three taco platter that comes with rice and refried beans. He got a pork taco, chicken tinga and a brisket taco that was grilled. The most perfect and favorite taco was the Chicken Tinga. It was very flavorful and made with moist dark chicken meat. The brisket had good flavors but it was stringy.

We were both really full so we took out a vegetable quesa (like a calzone but the dough is made with masa and it might be fried) to have latter because the quesa is usually really delicious and is a treat here. I don't remember what vegetables came in it on past visits but this time it was mostly just onions. I did find traces of spinach and mushrooms but it was filled with mostly onions and cheese and was still a tasty treat but it wasn't the same.

I still really like this place and service was ok too but some things aren't up there where they were before so I had to get it out there.

3 stars according to Yelp means A-OK"}
{"text":"Great Salsa Bar!!! Awesome breakfast burritos made fresh :)
We also got to try the tiger shrimp tacos, steak tacos.

The service was very friendly and attentive, will definitely come back to try their margaritas!"}
{"text":"My second time here and the food had been fantastic both times!  I got the Jamaica Rose Shrimp and La Nueva Ensenada and my husband got the shark taco.  We enjoyed everything very much and the service was speedy and friendly.  We also love the many selections at the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Oh.my. God. I have died and gone to taco heaven. Finding decent Mexican food as a vegetarian is hard, but I have succeeded! Not only were these the best vegetarian tacos I've ever had, but the best tacos I have ever had. Also the salsa Mexicana is to die for."}
{"text":"This location has much potential however do not expect any type of service here, the burro arabe was delicious but besides that my experience her was subpar. I wanted to visit this place because of the great salsa bar I had read about but once I was there, the salsa bar was sad and low stocked. None of the salsas looked fresh either. 

However, the fact that there's no customer service or organization of any kind, that is what ruins this place. 

Wish it was better, would be such an awesome place."}
{"text":"It was good. The only thing we didn't like was the wait time. Come early if you want a seat. Taco's were really good. I highly recommend this if you are in the area."}
{"text":"We went hiking the day after Thanksgiving and after that we were starving. I have been wanting to try this place out for a while, we loved it!! Not only did we enjoy the atmosphere & music, the food was seriously good!! I have to watch my carb intake and my husband discovered they had tacos protien style SCORE!! they were beautiful, looked like enchiladas.  I had the chicken tinga and gaucho steak tacos, the taste was an explosion sooo good!! Even the kids loved them. We really liked this place, the pictures of skeletons were awesome, our teen girls really thought it was cool! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This 4 is more like 4.5 stars and that's only because of the size and the 45 minute wait (which never end up really being 45 minutes.. and as a NYker.. this is not such a big deal.. it's the norm). When we had our food.. we understood why the name.. we reacted with \"ay santisima\" lol! 

The salsa bar is very creative and gave us mad options like the \"peanut chipotle\" and more. Now let's talk about these margaritas.. man oh mighty.. best margaritas I've had! and I've had my fair share of em! It's strong enough and they throw in a slice of grapefruit that really gives it a nice zing! The service was great, yes the bar is tiny and they clearly are understaffed but that didn't stop our server from giving us 5 star service! Drinks came quick and so did the food! Now the menu.. it can be a little intimidating and overwhelming with the immense options.. but definitely go for something you haven't had before, you won't regret it! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"as tony would say....'Grrrrreeeeeat' little taco shop 
just a little north of McDowell on 16th st, drive slow or else you'll miss it 
the shark taco were awesome, perfect crisp 
i did tried the carne asada meat, which could of used a little more favors 
the salas bar was pretty cool, lots of chooses 
the best part about the meal was the horchata....Mmmmmm 
my mouth waters just thinking about it 
it's about $4 or $5 for a 32oz horchata....better share it with someone 
they put fruits and peacan.....yummmm 
i would drive there just for the shark tacos and horchata"}
{"text":"Love the margaritas, extensive tequila menu & the food is great! Great salsa bar! A great place to bring family & friends when visiting Phoenix. Only downside was that they are a little short staffed & takes a little while to get yr drinks & food. Plan to be there a little while, but in the end, it's all worth it!."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal but overpriced. I took off one start because I felt like our waiter overhyped menu items, like the guacamole, which he told every table was selling out. It was a tiny cup of guac for $10 and was good, but not a must have item. 

The menu is unique and my friends and I enjoyed the flavors- best molé I've had!"}
{"text":"Wow! 

I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped into this joint. The decor was fun, the restaurant was super clean and the food was so great! I am so excited that this is within walking distance of my home. 

YOU MUST TRY THE HORCHATA! It tastes like my mom's except better. Wait? Is that even possible? Yes! I swear to little baby Jesus that this is the best horchata in the universe. 

The Cochinita Pibil taco was great, the mole chicken taco was great and the salsa bar was killer. I tried 5 or 6 and they were fresh and uniquely flavored. 

The best part? Three people ate for 20 bucks! I could have eaten cheaper if I had not gotten the plate. I took half of the food home, if that is any sign of the healthy (but not overly large) portions here. One taco would have done it for me. 

I will be a regular at this place!  You should try it too! :)"}
{"text":"I grew up in Arizona and this is the best horchata I have ever had. Salsa bar is fun and free. Artwork is gorgeous."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite taco shop! Cool vibe and excellent food! Order the protein style tacos! Low carb and super yummy! Load up on the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Good food best horchatas. Staff is good. I think the food became a bit greasier over the years. I would still go, but a little on  the greasy side for me."}
{"text":"Considering salsa is my favorite food group, La Condesa is a small piece of heaven. The carne asada and cabo shrimp tacos are delicious. This place gets very busy during lunch and is pretty cramped. Wouldn't recommend for large groups. Mmmmm salsa."}
{"text":"Not what i expected. I got a quesadilla and there was a puddle of grease on the plate. Not just a little grease, it was tons of it. I took a bite and it dripped down the side of my lip. Could only take 2 bites. I showed the waiter and he just shrugged his shoulders and apologized. I know he didnt cook it, but he didnt offer to remake it or worst case scenario take it off the bill. 2 street tacos and 2 bites of a quesadilla, that looked nothing like advertised for $21. Never again, lesson learned."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting better and better. They have updated their menu which now includes red and green chili. I tried the red chili and it was amazing and truly unique. Also, great margaritas! Still one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"I'm convinced this place has THE best margaritas in Phoenix. I came here with some coworkers for happy hour once and discovered their amazing grapefruit margaritas. Then a few weeks later I went back for dinner and got their veggie quesadilla which was insanely good. Actually, it got really busy while we were there and our orders got misplaced so we waited about 30 minutes to get our food. We weren't in any sort of rush, so it was fine, but the server actually comped our meals which was unexpected, but totally awesome.

Be warned this place is TINY so if you've got a big group, prepare to wait. But trust me it's worth it. They also have a salsa bar in the back - my favorite was the pecan. Amazing."}
{"text":"Absolutely first rate, best Mexican (Oaxacan) food in town. Best I have ever tasted! Incredible flavor profiles. This is not your typical Mexican fair, it is bistro chef quality. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Meh. The best part of my order was the rice. I had a taco combo plate with 3 tacos. The taco shells were way too crispy and dripping with grease. I could hardly bite them. Not really impressed with the flavors of the different meats I chose. For what I ordered, over-priced and the flavor was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Four stars for the tacos and salsa. Three stars for everything else. 

Coming here on a Tuesday night, it was packed. Oddly enough, there was a whole other room that seemed like a \"group table\" room, even though there was room for other people. I got seated fairly quickly since I was solo, but a group of four literally sat at the waiting area the entire time I was dining. I started off with their horchatas. I didnt like the fact that they only serve a 32 oz but I went with what they had. The horchata came off more like water than rice milk. They add alot of fresh fruit, which is great, but is hard to drink with skinny straws. Many of times the straw got clogged. Id recommend packing a boba tea straw. The flavor was mostly cinnamon, lacking a cream flavor. 

The chips are nothing special, but that salsa was something special. Not only do they have a wide variety of great flavors, but its all self serve! It was hard not to devour all the chips with that salsa. 

Service wise, it was lagging. The waiter didnt bring me water until 20 minutes after I sat down. At the time, i wa swell, hydrated, so I wasnt evem mad about it. I will say that I had to flag down the waiter everytime I needed something. 

I ordered the Santisima Taco and the Gaucho Quesidilla. the taco was superb. Great ingredients, great tortilla, and the shrimp was a nice addition! The salsa only made it better. The quesidilla was not exactly what I was expecting. They deep fry the thing, but its more like corn masa than flour. Its not bursting with flavor, but its decent. The ingredients inside of course were really good. the avocado and cheese they had on top of the quesadilla only enhanced the meal. 

I would be curious to try their Gaucho as a burrito. i wouldnt mind coming back here again, but I really hope they get better service. I know I wont be ordering that horchata!"}
{"text":"Best margaritas I've EVER had. Tacos are fantastic, salsa delicious and authentic. Everything is fresh. Only downside is that it's quite small. Worth the wait and prices are great"}
{"text":"This is as amazing Mexican restaurant that defies the idea that the only good Mexican food must use lard and have meat. They audio have a new team that provides great customer service.  Louts of vegetarian and vegan options, plus lots of meat and seafood options. Everyone can eat together without being an award existence. This is what eating out with friends should be!"}
{"text":"This place is great... Thanks yelp for this place in town for a convention. Needed to find a lace with margaritas and tacos. Both exceeded expectations. Best place in phx that I have tried so far."}
{"text":"THE GOOD: cilantro crema salsa is still divine. salsa bar is still fun. drinky drink bar has been opened and liquor license granted since my initial 4-star review.

THE BAD: la condesa has gone well downhill in terms of food quality since i visited years ago. the crispy, delicious shrimp tacos i raved about previously are no longer the same menu item. they've replaced the large, succulent shrimp with smaller specimens that were decidedly not tasty or even beer battered. service still spotty.

THE UGLY: the food doesn't taste like there is a thoughtful process in its creation any more. have they changed owners? everything we ordered here was run-of-the-mill, not ravingly good as we'd experienced previously. the fish in their tacos was fishy, which is never a sign of freshness.

so disappointed because a meal here used to be worth a special trip."}
{"text":"Very under impressed.. Food was average and that is being generous.. Not to mention there was a hair in my food and they took it back, came back out and claimed it was \"cheese\" and still was charged for it.  The bathrooms are also disgusting.  Save yourself the time and go down the street to Carambas."}
{"text":"Believe the hype, yo. (And order the mole.)"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place ... I wanted to for it 5 stars but I can't. First off it's cramped and while it's possible to look past it if it was slightly cramped this place was trying to be the poster child for cramped. Don't come with a party of more than 2 for that's not gonna happen. Dropped a star for the cramp factor 
Another star goes for the restrooms.. Let's just say it's best to avoid it all together for there is no coming back once you go in...
Now that the negatives are out the door the food was good. By good I mean they have a real unique selection of salsas and the tacos are good too but really the seating takes away from the experience ... For me it did .. Your mileage may wary ..happy yelping"}
{"text":"Salsa Bar, Mole Quesadilla, Chochinita Pibil, Tacos Al Pastor and Sonora Arrechera Tacos where really tasty and perfectly balanced. I loved every single bit. I cleaned the plate like never before my family did 2. Great horchata and decor of the restaurant, can't wait to comeback for more!!"}
{"text":"I've always passed by the place but didn't take notice until I got a groupon for it and wanted to try it out. I really liked the decor and the restaurant looks clean. The food I ordered was great and fresh, and the horchata was quite different from other places but it was pretty good. They had a wide variety of salsa, my favorite was the salsa pecan. I would most likely come back again for the food and good customer service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome the pastor tacos are delicious. The homemade salsa bar is authentic and has something for everybody. Would recommend this place if you like good Mexican food especially the street tacos."}
{"text":"Love La Condesa!  They have a fantastic salsa bar with delicious, interesting salsas and a range of fantastic tacos (something for everyone).  The environment is cozy, albeit a little small.  The only thing that would make it better is if it were BYOB (they recently started serving alcohol).  Phoenix needs more restaurants like this one!"}
{"text":"Great service--Nick is stellar! Margaritas were great, food was delicious, salsa bar is fun, and all very inexpensive."}
{"text":"Here's what you'll like.
The salsa bar. 
It features about a dozen types of salsas, ranging from traditional to the more obscure pecan.
The cochinita quesadilla, which really doubles as a Mexican stromboli only deep fried and not baked, is a culinary triumph.
And the artwork, all of which macabre -  depicting 'Dio del muerto' scenes -  is erie to say the least, but colorful and provocative.

Here's what you won't like.
Your missing car if you don't lock it and set the alarm.
The chairs - likely designed by an orthopedic surgeon whose life's mission is to rid the world of scoliosis, one taco aficionado at a time.

In their defense, the chairs look to be some kind of Mexican relic, something they found in an old Mission or something. They're artsy and very heavy carved wood. 
One problem.
They're so heavy, when you stand up, attempting to furtively sneak to the salsa bar for the fifth time hoping no-one will spot your sloth-ass in the process, they'll give you up in a New York second as they make the most God-awful racket scraping the bare floor. 

I don't like it when I'm trying to be sneaky and some inanimate object signals everyone, warning them of my intentions to abscond with the entire salsa bar, greedily hogging it all to myself."}
{"text":"Customer service sucks!!! Waited 15mins just to get the menu. Food is good tho"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food restaurants in the valley! I have been here a handful of times and always bring my guests from out of town! Love the salsa bar and they have great vegetarian options! Great atmosphere and a great location just north of downtown!"}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp and carnitas tacos (both delicious!)  and washed it down with an ice-cold Mexican Coke (the only soda I'll drink).  

The salsa bar is GREAT - variety. The walls are covered with local art. 

Con: There is nowhere to wait if the modest sized restaurant is full. No one wants to wait in the heat during the summer."}
{"text":"I've have now experienced the best steak taco in my lifetime!!! Hats off to you folks!! I will Def be back!!"}
{"text":"Had a sample of tacos. The mole is amazing and so is the tinga!  The salsa bar is amazing with many delicious and spicy options. Don't be fooled by the guacamole...it is spicy but delicious."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying ..... This restaurant is hyped for NO reason. 
The horchata is definitely a fail in my books. There was too much going on in the horchata that I lost the taste with all the fruit in there including walnuts. It should just be called \"Fruit Drink\". You can't even get a sip with something coming up your straw. Also ABSOLUTLEY not worth 5$ !!!! FAIL

 To eat I got 3 Tacos (Carne Asada & Chicken Tinga) and rice and beans
The carne asada tacos were basic and tasted the same as any other place . I did enjoy the tinga taco it had a lot of flavor but nothing was good enough that would make me want to come back. 
My boyfriend got a deep fried carne asada quesadilla that he said was \"good\" but nothing amazing. 

All in All it's all hype 
You can get better tacos and Horchata at Ta Carbon!"}
{"text":"Popped in here over the Labor Day weekend after reading the Yelp Reviews.  One word....WOW!

The tortilla chips were fresh and not soaked in grease, the 20+ salsa's were fresh and flavorful, the burritos and street tacos were some of the best we ever had.  To top it off, our server was wonderful.

It's a small place with 20 or so tables, if their busy I urge you to wait it out.  They turn the tables quickly and it will be with the wait!"}
{"text":"This was a great spot. It looks a little sketchy but the food was so gooooood. My friend and I each got three vegetarian tacos and they were delicious. The salsa bar was great too. The mojito was the best I've had."}
{"text":"For the last several months America's Taco has ruled the downtown Taco scene.  Now just across the neighborhood a new rival emerges.  Not since Magic and Bird graced the hardwood have we seen the seeds for so tasty a rivalry.  
From the great Mexican artesenia laden decor to the great service to the impeccable salsa bar- try the strawberry or peanut salsa- the place is top notch.
The menu is diverse so it merits several repeat visits for purposes of exploration.  I'm still a novice but I am completely sold on the cochinita pibil.  The pork is as tender and flavorful as anything you will get up the street at the Barrio Cafe.  
The place is still young.  But the rate at which incredible reviews surface on Yelp , it is testament enough that it deserves your patronage."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of big fancy, red carpet joints, this is not the place for you. The service is not good, it is understaffed, the restaurant itself is small and there are a boat load of people there. If you like eating some kick ass Mexican food though, this place tops the list. I had the pork and bean burrito with a side of their chipotle salsa. The meat was so tender and the flavor was so developed, I wept a little with each bite. This is on my radar for the next time I come out to Phoenix.  Just hope they find a bigger location or open a taco truck."}
{"text":"The food is 5 +++ Stars! Completely unique and so flavorful. I can't say enough about the Quesa's (except I really hope they are fat free...hehe) Their tacos are even great after a 15 min car ride back to my home. Everything I have tried has been very tasty! 

The Salsa's are 5++++ Stars! The cilantro cream, holy moly can I have a gallon to put on anything and everything...I really  think it will make everything taste amazing!

Over all La Condesa is a great Gourmet Taco shop and the quality of the food definitely  puts the Gourmet in the name. I love using La Condesa as take home food for out of town guest, they are always impressed!

What knocks my review down a star, difficulty parking and the lack of AC in the summer. I much prefer to get it to go!"}
{"text":"The absolute best Burros and street tacos for a great reasonable price!"}
{"text":"This place was always good, except today was not too good.  It's bigger now.  Took 15+ mins to get seated although place was only half full at 2pm on Saturday.  Service was slow too.  Ordered large Guacamole it was small portion didn't look fresh, tons of other ingredients like cranberries and not enough avocados.  I had chicken burrito, but it was mostly beans.   My friend was way hungry but didn't finish his plate.... didn't like his plate either.  Maybe just an off day for them, not sure."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I had chunks of bone in my chicken burrito, and no one came to check back to ask us how the food was. On top of that the place was small and claustrophobic, there was 3 groups of screaming kids that echoed the entire time we were there. I would not recommend this to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Love the salsa bar and the burritos are always great... not to mention the house margaritas.  Only wish the wait wasn't crazy but that's what happens when a place makes great food!"}
{"text":"Just ok.  Not sure all the hype is about. I have a taco and chili verde burro ... eh."}
{"text":"I came here by recommendation from a friend and I couldn't have been more satisfied!! First off, it happened to be Taco Tuesday when I went so that meant $2 for all street tacos. Secondly, they have an unlimited salsa bar with ALL kinds of salsa (everything from traditional salsas like pico de gallo to interesting dips like peanut butter salsa). Thirdly, to top it off, margaritas are $4 all-day everyday...whaaaat?? These deals are almost too good to be true.

My boyfriend and I decided to order and share all five street tacos plus the \"gourmet\" baby shark taco. Each taco packed bold flavors in it - the al pastor was possibly the best spicy pork taco I've had (loved the pineapple bits in the avocado salsa!), the brisket in the chilango suadero was incredibly juicy, and the chicken tinga with pickled onions made a perfect combo. The star of the show though were the shark tacos. The fried fish had a light crispy beer batter, and each bite had delicious, tender, flaky baby shark in it. So good.

The only taco I probably wouldn't order again was the chicken asado. Not that it tasted bad by any means, but after eating all the other tacos, the flavors in this one were rather underwhelming.

Good service and great food. Absolutely will be back next time I'm visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"Awesome Quesadillas. They are more like empanadas than quesidillas but they are so good. Try the mahi mahi, it was so fresh and the sause was wonderful. the salsa bar will show you a dozen different salsas. Really fun to try them all."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been eating at the original one on 16st and palm ln for about 2 years. This one is even better!  I love the quesadillas. Not your moms quesadilla!  I almost always get th he chicken mole in the quesadilla.  Love it. I have tried almost everything.  I would also recommend chicken Tinga. Shrimp tacos are awesome. Try all 20 of the salsas. Including,  pecan, hicima.  Green toatilllo is awesome. The Margaritas are fresh with chunks of fruit! Yummy! Enjoy."}
{"text":"Terrific little place. The salsa bar is fabulous as others have noted. Everything looked fresh and distinctive. Had the Oaxacan Mole Chicken Queso. It was a large stuffed, perfectly fried stuffed tortilla. The chocolate mole was one of the best Mexican sauces I've had. A little spicy, a little bitter, and very savory. Haunting."}
{"text":"Recently some of my colleagues from Spain were visiting and on their last night in town, I offered to take them to dinner.   They immediately told me that they NEEDED to have authentic Mexican food and they really wanted tacos.   After searching through pages and pages of Yelp and Google, and polling my friends on facebook...I finally chose La Condesa over many strong recommendations of Los Dos Molinos, Barrio Cafe, Aunt Chiladas, and many more....   Now, I realized that never having been there myself before I was taking a bit of a risk...but my fellow Yelpers surely couldn't lead me astray, right?!   

Happily, they did not!   The food was delicious.  The four of us all ordered different kinds of tacos and we all loved our dishes!  I had the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, which I DEFINITELY recommend!  The flavor was amazing! a little heat, a little citrusy....mmm mmm mmm!!   Two of my co-workers had the Carne Asada and they both raved about it the whole way home. we all shared an Horchata for dessert -- wow!  very good too!  It's a big drink, so I do recommend sharing - it's totally worth it!    Their bellies were content before the long flight back to Espana!   

The portions were good.  Not too big, not too small.  Two tacos were filling - I always like to know what to expect.  Nobody had any leftovers, so I think the portions were just right.  

Of course, the salsa bar is a key feature of this place.  I think we only made it through 5 or 6 kinds and I liked them all.   The mango one was one of my favorites, which is a surprise b/c I'm not usually a huge fan, but I loved the sweet and spicy combo - it was done just right.   

I've already sent the link to my foodie brother in law - the whole fam will be visiting for the holidays, we will definitely be going back!   This will be a MUST visit place for my future recommendations!  

Yeah!"}
{"text":"Great spot!!! Artwork was amazing the bartender was so fun!!!!! Local hanging out .....the food was bomb diggity i had the carne asada plate wow! The margs off the chart ! Kudos guys welcome to the neighborhood!!!!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant, love all the vegetarian options. The downside is the small parking lot. 
The cauliflower al pastor taco is amazing."}
{"text":"Honestly, if you like Mexican/Latin American food, eat here. The food is great!! I didn't care too much for the salsas because most were too spicy for me or just not to my liking...but I'll give them a pass-who needs salsa when the food is that good! The restaurant is small, and can be uncomfortable when full. But the place does have character, and our server was more than wonderful."}
{"text":"Great food can be served anywhere. My wife and me got lost couple of times while on gps!!duh! Who thinks of such a neat and cool place in this neighborhood. The food is great , really really great and their salsa bar is seriously awesome.thanks to all my yelp family for giving me this place!"}
{"text":"Not worth the hype... waited 30 mins and got bland and flavorless fried pork quesadilla... Yuck. Unfortunately me and my pregnant wife we both ordered similar item she had chicken in hers and I was lucky one to get the deep fried chewy like gum fried pork which was Very bizarre. Horchata was again over hyped I felt. All in all it was 40 minutes wait time with my pregnant wife and garbage like taste at least what we ordered. The salsa's are not so great I can make better one in my Vitamix @home or you can get canned salsa's from food city which are far better.

May be the burritos and Tacos are good and I am writing this review if there are someone like me who might dislike deep fried chewy pork in Quesadilla.

It was $33 with tip $38 (I don't know why I tipped... lol)I  wish I wouldn't have gone there and would buy some food for hungry people on the streets with the same amount of money that would have given me much satisfaction. Will never go here again... If in FL try Senor Taco in St Petersburg and try all the items it's worth every penny. I am an Indian and trying to find a good Mexican restaurant but it's bland taste in Phoenix including this place."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I ordered a margarita, the Fundido dip with chorizo, and tacos. Flavors were delicious and the quality was great! The menu is slightly overwhelming (in a good way), but provides GF, Vegan, and Vegetarian options as well! The open salsa bar was great!"}
{"text":"This place has to get all five stars. Ok, the area is a little suspect I will admit; that can be countered with the excellent food and excellent prices. This is the kind of food that goes for $12 - $15/plate if it were located in an upscale area.  They have done a great job with the interior and the food is really wonderful.

5 Top reasons I love La Condesa:
 ~ Beautiful food. Unique flavors. 
 ~ Great salsa bar: aver a dozen lovely hand made salsas; I liked them all
 ~ Price: you can spend under $7 and have a really good meal
 ~ Convelient: It is only a 2 minute drive from 24th & Camelback.
 ~ Atmosphere: the interior and the service create a great place to dine.

***We eat out several times a week, and this place is now at the top of the list for my wife and I both.***"}
{"text":"I will lead with saying that this place has awesome tacos. That said, the service is awful, at best. They seems to run 1 waiter/waitress at a give time which seems odd since they are always busy. Granted the place is small, but still too much for 1 wait staff to run, at a non stop pace. 

My bigger issue is how the act towards or treat customers. Below are a couple of lines I heard today a lone \"you're going to have to wait at least 30 minutes, if you want to wait\", almost seemed like they didn't want me to to stick around. When I sat at the bar which is supposed to be first come first served, I asked for a drink as I waited for my table. \"Everything is first come first served, so you're going to have to wait for that too\" is the answer I received. For a drink? 

Overall this was a strange and disappointing experience, and it was the second time something like this has happened. I really enjoyed their food, which makes it more disappointing that I likely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Oh, La Santisima. I had this placed bookmarked as one of the places to check out when I was in town. I knew about the downtown location, however due to the parking and the location I was pretty iffy about it. When I learned that there was a second location with a private parking lot behind the shop, I jumped at it. I came here with some coworkers that were hungry for something new so as always they accompanied me in my food adventures.

So let's see, this building is right off a main road and it basically looks like a house. I got a little lost and turned a street early and had to get back on the road to turn again.  Inside the restaurant there were a lot of portraits of Dia de muertos (Day of the Dead) artwork and other artworks such as Luchadores on the walls which I thought was very interesting and it's something that I usually see when you go to a Mexican restaurant. It gives the restaurant an identity and something memorable when I think of the restaurant. There's indoors and outdoor seating, we sat inside as it was getting dark and it was still 100 degree weather outside.

I ordered the Al Pastor Burrito, which I can say wasn't really on the menu because I basically asked for it and wanted to see what they had. They obliged, and when it came out it was different as it had pineapples in it which was pretty interesting. I think even if they left out the pineapple, it would've been tasty. It was good. The restaurant also sported a full salsa bar, and you could get as much as you wanted and there were so many options. I didn't really use it other than to add some heat to the burrito. However, this burrito was pretty awesome, and one of the best that I had when I was in Phoenix (out of the limited amount of places I went to).

The Mahi Pastor Taco, was just okay. This was ordered after I finished the burrito, and we were just talking. Why not keep eating? So, the taco was pretty simplistic which wasn't bad, but I think it lacked a little bit of flavor. There wasn't really any special about it, but I keep thinking about the burrito. So if you're deciding to get this taco compared to the other ones, I say pass on this as you're probably missing anything.

And well, a margarita is a margarita. Nothing unusual or special there.

Overall, it was great. I think I would come back here if I was in town. The amount of food that you got compared to other places were comparable. We came here on a pretty empty night so the service was pretty good. I can't say for all times during the day, but my experience it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"This place is worth the lunch rush, the line always moves quickly & you can't beat the food. I've ordered the street tacos & El mariachi burrito enchilada style. Love the Jamaica."}
{"text":"As always, GREAT FOOD AND MARGARITAS. But service was the absolute worst. We received our margs after our tacos (which took 50 min) and they still charged us. Server didn't even apologize. Sucks to leave so disappointed from a favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food around.
Salsa bar has too many options - cilantro salsa got me like crazy.
The classic lime margarita ( superb tasty), gandhi bowl, gandhi taco, vegan burro ( I don't remember the name) second one on their vegan menu- these are the things we ordered and every dish stands top.

Really liked it. FYI the waiting time is crazy. Entered at 8:10 and we seated by 9:00. I have no idea if they actually take reservations but a must try place."}
{"text":"Provender: tacos! On Saturday mornings they have both a breakfast and lunch menu. I ordered the guacho, espana, and mayan chochinita tacos, which were fantastic. The michelada was also delicious.

Prices: reasonable, the specialty tacos are about $5 each, but they have combos.

Parking: there are spaces on 16th and Palm lane.

People: fun for all ages.

Perks: the food is amazing. The artwork inside is dope. They also have a salsa bar with a wide variety of salsa. Oh, the wait staff are excellent. Jordan was such a cutie. If I lived here I would've asked her out . . . on a taco date!"}
{"text":"We were so impressed with this place and so surprised we had never heard of it!

Salsa:
There are something like 20 different salsa to choose from in their salsa bar but our favorite was the salsa mexicana which was nice and garlicky with chopped cilantro. You scoop the salsas into little plastic containers similar to what you'd find in a taqueria but this is definitely a cloth napkin type of place. Luckily, there are free chips with which to try the many salsa so you can pick your favorite before you food arrives. 

Food:
So fresh, warm, and just plain delicious. We split the Santo Plato and Traditional Quesa. The Santo Plato comes with your choice of burro and taco with a side of calabacitas. We chose the fish taco which conveniently came with two pieces of fish and two tortillas so it was like having two tacos! It was traditional fried fish \"Baja\" style but it was light and crispy instead of greasy and came with a savory white sauce. The La Condesa Veggie burro was filled white Mexican-style rice (but not that orangish \"Mexican rice\" you see at fast food joints), Oaxaca cheese, mushrooms, spinach, poblano pepper, onions and fresh garlic. The burro is grilled after its assembled which enhanced the mouth feel. Crispy outside, soft inside. The calabacitas were just grilled green Mexican squash, nothing special. The Traditional Quesa was unlike anything I'd ever seen. They're made with a THICK, dense corn tortilla, stuffed with Oaxaca cheese, and then grilled for a nice crunch. These bad boys are HUGE and have so much cheese which made me relieved to be sharing. You have to eat it with a fork and knife but it was amazing with different salsa varieties drizzled on top. 

Drinks:
Try the Horchata! Best we've ever had. They put real fruit and pecans in it. There was some sort of strawberry syrup in the bottom but it was not overly sweet. The serving size is 32oz which was a lot bigger than we were expecting. We didn't get any alcohol but I overheard the guy next to us tell the waitress his margarita was amazing. 

Atmosphere:
Be prepared because this place it TINY! We got there at the right time because when we were leaving all of the 10 or so tables were full. People didn't have room to wait and some turned around and left as soon as they came in and saw how crowded it was. There is an itty bitty bar that a few people chose to wait at. The decor is cute but the custom made chairs were a bit fragile as I had to switch mine out due to the bottom falling out. 

Overall:
We know Mexican food and this may be the best we've ever had. We'll have to go back for a few more visits to be sure but for now we certainly left smacking our lips with the delicious flavors we had just tasted on our lips and on our minds."}
{"text":"First i wanted a quesadilla and they didnt have any cheese and then the waitress skiped our table and gave food to 2 other tables that got there after us.. never going back.."}
{"text":"Hands down yum and fave taco place in town!!!!! Haven't tried the burros as I'm in love with the tacos... Love love the salsa bar as well! Cute inside, nothing fancy and a great place to take friends. If you like barrio, you will love la condesa (so will your wallet)."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.

Best taco I have ever eaten in my entire life. No lie. My husband and friend said the same thing when they took their first bites.

The salsa bar is great, too, but OMG those tacos......."}
{"text":"So whenever former Phoenix Yelper Jim W arrives or departs, you can count on a dust storm, a big one.  It's like he's got his own set of haboobs.  But when he suggested La Condesa, I said to hell with a clean car and clean hair.  It was about time I met La Condesa.  And the pleasure was all mine.

First off, the salsa bar is more like a salsa buffet.  And the guacamole..yum, it had mango in it!  Not sure if that's a seasonal thing, but it was tasty.  The carne asada taco was good, but the Mayan Cochinita Pibil taco (let's just call it shredded pork) was so far beyond good, you have to taste it to believe it.  And I suggest you do, soon."}
{"text":"Feel like I'm just repeating what everyone said but it's that good. We went on a Saturday about 1pm and the place was packed. We waited about 15 and got seated.  Great service and salsa bar. Got the carne asada tacos and they were delicious. With the many salsas that they have you can really add many different flavors to your tacos. Loved it but I think next time I will go during off peak hours"}
{"text":"The salsa bar is \"all that and a bag of chips!\" \"Since when do you go to a salsa bar, where the salsas are actually really full of flavor, thick (not watered down), and unique?!\" as my friends put it so well! It's sounds strange, but the pecan salsa was delicious! The peanut salsa was still spicy but had a hint of peanut in it, so it wasn't overwhelmingly \"peanuty.\" There was a strawberry rhubarb pepper type of salsa. This may sound a little too strange for most, but it was almost like a spicy dessert type sauce. Don't forget to order some margaritas to wash those salsa and chips down. I would say you could get filled up on salsa, chips and margaritas alone here and be more than satisfied, but I'm not sure the owners would be too happy about that! The salsa variety was nothing less than astounding! And don't worry your precious little heart. There are traditional ones too: green tomatillo, chipotle red pepper, jicama, and cilantro... just to name a few!

Slow roasted cochinitas pibil (pork) tacos, slow cooked chicken mole tacos, beer battered Dogfish shark tacos, battered shrimp tacos, el gaucho steak in chimchurri sauce tacos with guacamole. Oh gawd, yes! And affirmative... these were all eaten in one sitting.... well, with a little help from Bryan too. He's so thoughtful for that too. I might have died from eating too much. We live so far from here that I just wanted to \"stock up,\" and I came oh so close to having to be rolled out of the place like that \"blueberry girl\" from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!"}
{"text":"The fish burrito here is my favorite and don't forget to try the horchata--best I've had! They load it with extra cinnamon, pecans, cantaloupe and strawberries. 

The salsa bar is amazing and the quesadillas are deep fried--yum!"}
{"text":"I like this place... there are a lot of interesting salsas to taste and the people were very friendly. However, the meat taco I had (it was recommended) was dry and not very flavorful. The vegetarian one was pretty great though- both could have used more spice. All in all- the location is cool and small- I like that it is unique for Phoenix, and I would definitely come back if I was in the area- I just wish their food was a little more spicy."}
{"text":"Excellent and unique!!  The steak quesadilla is huge...a meal in itself.  It was fried to crispy, flaky perfection.  The tacos - el gaucho steak and cochinita pork - were very delicious.  Prices were very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food.  It's a smaller place but we went at 4 pm before it got crowded.  It's a must for taco lovers."}
{"text":"Simply put - if you don't think this is 5-star food I don't know what to tell you.  Salsa bar is amazing and had things I've never seen before - and it was amazing.  If I could only drink and eat chips and salsa , I'd still give it 5-stars.  Tons of taco options. Their quesadillas are more like empanadas and fried (super delicious.)  Go here...and prepare to come back often..."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant because the street tacos were very good and all of the different salsas to pick from were very tasty. I especially like the chipotle salsa, It took me to flavor town. The restaurant was very colorful and nicely decorated. The plates were neat and the staff was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Worth the wait. The quesadilla is the best. It's like a Mexican calzone you need to try it. Delicious salsa bar and food."}
{"text":"Salsa bar is second to none.  They must have 20+- Salsa's to choose from.  The food is quite good as well.  That being said, and it just may have been an isolated incident, but our car window was broken out while dining.  We informed the workers and they did not seem surprised.  My guess is this has happened before and will happen again.  If I go back, it will not be in my car."}
{"text":"I almost feel useless writing this review, I think everyone has said it all.  But still, I liked it just that much that I want to have my say anyway!

I had one shrimp taco and one pibil taco.  The pibil was...... just... so, so so so good.  It made me want to exit through the kitchen and shoot the chef a la Johnny Depp (*i will not shoot any chefs, please do not report me).  The tortillas were just right, and I already want another one.

The shrimp taco.... I hate to say it but it WAS bland.  Not bad, just not very flavorful.  I poured on a bunch of the Cilantro Cream salsa, which didn't add much.  I'll stick with the pibil!

On to the salsas:  Believe the hype over this strawberry salsa.  Who the heck thinks these things up??  Regardless, it's brilliant and I hope they start selling it by the jar.  I was super excited about the cilantro cream, but it fell a little flat.  Like the shrimp tacos, it was good, just not filled with flavor.  The only other salsa I had was the plain old salsa, and it was really great as well.

And as for the horchata, I have never had horchata like that.  It really was delicious, but just so sweet and rich that I don't think I even finished 1/4 of it.  And for some reason, you can't get a smaller size.  But for a few sips after your meal, mmmmmmmmmm.

Dave B is right about the price.  BUT, we each got 2 tacos, and neither one of us finished them both.  I really think that splitting a 2 taco meal, combined with the DELICIOUS tortilla chips, is more than enough for 2 people.

As others have mentioned, the artwork is just stunning.  I love Day of the Dead art, and these were beautiful.  

In short, the Yelpers are all right.  Just go, and thank us later."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by on Sunday for lunch. We were both blown away by the quality of the food. My husband ordered the carne asada street tacos.... He ate everything and loved it. I ordered the Gandhi vegan burro with red enchilada sauce over it. I highly recommend it to anyone. It was huge so I had to take half home. However, it was so delicious I ended up eating the remainder several hours later for dinner. The house margarita is definitely worth the order as well. Mixed perfectly! We were both truly blown away- well for two gringos born and raised in AZ who've had our fair share of trips to numerous cities in Mexico. This place is small- roughly 32 people can dine in. While we were there there was not one empty table. I'm glad we stopped in- we will be back."}
{"text":"You know you are the right place when the abuela's are waiting for a table and the drinks taste like the Mexican Rivera. Bonus points for vegan and veggie option that taste great!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The quesadillas are a must have. Loved the salsas, had many to pick from. Highly recommend this yummy place."}
{"text":"This is one my favorite taco places but today was a disappointment.  Service was bad, the tacos were super dry and over cooked.  I ordered the street tacos.  Even the rice was dry out.  The caldo de mariachi was too salty with flavor. The margarita was too sweet. Had to ask for flatware, napkins and water refill."}
{"text":"The chile en nogada taco is unforgettably amazing.  The salsa bar is delicious.  The mole was underwhelming."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place and was disappointed. Apparently they have recently expanded and could definitely not keep up with the demand. My husband and I ordered two margaritas after we finally got greeted by our server. The margaritas took about 15 minutes to reach us. Food took a very long time also, the servers were doing what they could but they are definitely understaffed. If you are going to expand your location you should also hire more employees to keep up with the demand."}
{"text":"By far the best mexican food I've found in Phoenix, and trust me, I've eaten at almost all of them :)  I tend to get their street tacos with either pastor or carne asada, but everything is good here.  They have an awesome little salsa bar with like 10 different kinds of salsa.  I live in Anthem and we drive out of our way 30+ minutes to eat here it's that good!"}
{"text":"All of these years I've been living downtown just down the street from here and I haven't been until today. Everything here is amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Except the service. In their defense, the restaurant does warn you that the dining area has recently expanded and they are relying on a small kitchen. Too bad our food and drinks were out right on time. Our server was hard to find and not very friendly. That's a shame. 

Now that we've gotten that bad stuff out of the way let's talk about the fun stuff. First, the salsa bar. Oooo girl. There's something like 15 salsas and sauces here. They're all amazing but I'd recommend the pecan salsa. You do get a free bowl of chips, but it is 2.70 for another one. A little disappointed about that since there's so much salsa to try but that's okay. 

Second, dranks! We ordered the blue devil margarita, which was full of fruit and sweetness almost like an amazing marg-sangria hybrid. My table also got a huge michelada and some other regular margaritas. All were absolutely delish. 

Last, but not least, those tacos tho!!! There are just too many to list here but out table ordered some of the best looking ones, mahi al pastor, baby shark, tiger shrimp, battered and fried avocado, cauliflower, and Barbacoa. The Barbacoa was certainly the least exotic but my favorite. The tortilla was softly fried and just tooooo good. The vegetarian and vegan choices were numerous if that's your kind of thing. Much appreciated to see a restaurant that serves lots of options for those with dietary restrictions other than just another damn salad! 

Get here now because you are missing one of Phoenix's greatest hits!"}
{"text":"The Queso Fundido with the mushrooms and poblano peppers was delish.   Loved the mole tacos.   Outstanding food."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a late lunch/early dinner today (Sunday). It's pretty small and kind of feels like you're at a friends house which is a nice change of pace. 

Pros:
The food was GREAT. I had a veggie quesadilla but it was more like a Mexican calzone- I had to eat it with a fork. Seriously so much flavor and it was big enough to eat half and save for later but I'm a bad ass and ate almost all of it because that's how I roll.

My husband (the picky one) had a carne Asada burrito- just steak, beans and cheese plus he added sour cream. Two bites in we were already making plans to come back.

There were plenty of vegetarian and vegan options so I'm excited to go back and try something different next time!

They have a huge salsa bar but half of the salsas were missing descriptions so it was kind of a guessing game.

The horchata was huge and came with fresh fruit, nuts and cinnamon on top. It was good but not as thick as expected (I'm just a white girl from Kansas so I'm not an expert).

Cons:
Parking can be a pain- I tried to come on a Saturday night and eventually gave up because I was already in a bad mood.

The chips were nothing special and salt would not stay on! They were free though so not holding that against them. 

From the one $, I expected the prices to be cheaper. I wasn't even sure if there would be waiter service. For a burrito, quesadilla, horchata and two negra models (on special) it came to $32 and change plus tip.


Overall, we were very satisfied and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is not for people who are looking for fast food experiences...... it's slo-mo in every way and well worth the mouth watering delicious food they bring to your table ..... so many different salsa selections even one with a peanut butter base maybe my favorite..... so unique and delicious..... it's unbelievable!!!! Please take the time and visit!"}
{"text":"Worst experience, this place has gone way down hill. Called ahead to see if they had guacamole before making the 45 minute drive was told yes they had plenty and weren't close to running out. On arrival was told they were out of guacamole. Food took 50 minutes to get the table and two of the orders were supposed to be 3 chicken street taco plates server came to the table with brisket when we told him that we ordered chicken he came back 5 minutes later with undercooked chicken tacos. Server changed twice and more than 10 servers were standing around while cups and chips were empty.  The bar tender stood in the bar and was eating while behind the bar. One of the servers stood on a bar chair and the bar top to refill the horchata. Super gross super bad service very disappointing no refund was offered."}
{"text":"Ok this place is definitely over rated! The food sucks and the waitress couldn't make a margarita to save her life. It is also very pricy and you are better of going to a taco stand!"}
{"text":"This is about authentic as it gets. Amazing salsa bar, margaritas, rice and beans are worth it too. When we were here, the fire department stopped to eat here so you know its good. The wait was worth it for sure. Its nothing fancy in here but the food is really good."}
{"text":"My wife brought me here for my birthday last year I'm going to tell her to bring me again just because the food is great"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited recently because we both wanted some good authentic Mexican food. It was my first visit but he's been many times before. 

Even on a Monday at 130, which we thought would be after the lunch rush, we still had about a 20 minute wait. And then when we were seated, we waited another 15ish minutes just for someone to wait on us - no water or drinks in that entire period. However, we made about 3 trips up to the salsa bar, almost just to pass time, but also because he is addicted to the peanut sauce.

But luckily it was all uphill from there. Once our server did come to us, we placed our order right away. I got an orange Margarita (funky, but good) and he got the gigantic horchata, which was sweet, but just not really for me.

I decided on the street taco plate - 1 chicken, 1 carne asada, and 1 chilango, plus rice and beans. My boyfriend got a chicken quesadilla.

For street style tacos, it was definitely a good amount of food. And his quesadilla was gigantic. But oozing with cheese, so we knew it was going to be good.

It was my only meal of the day, but we both finished our plates and didn't have a single regret in the world after that.

It's worth the wait and you get a good amount of food for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Amazing! The best Mexican food I've EVER had! Get the horchata, you'll be thanking me later!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here as I am an avid Mexican food enthusiast. Everything I've had here tastes delicious - from the tacos, burritos, tortas, and quesas (like a quesadilla but made with a fried corn tortilla) which are a must try! The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review is due to the mediocre service. It sometimes takes over 10 minutes to have someone come over and put your name in and the table service is average every time I've been. Nonetheless, I continue to come here regularly because the food is so tasty!"}
{"text":"Been there not so much anymore s***** food was great people think they know what they're doing not so much"}
{"text":"First time visiting here. Got there about 1130am and it wasn't packed yet.

You grab a menu as you enter and order at the register. They give you a number and bring the food to your table.

We got a variety of tacos, chicken tortilla soup, fresh guac, etc.

Everything was very good. The salsa bar had a lot of items and red/green sauces, pico, etc.

I enjoyed all the food and will definitely be back when we're in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Life is all about creating a balance. This idea translates to a restaurant with its elements of food, service and decor.

The gourmet taco shop La Condesa is still trying to find its own equilibrium, but the line of customers nearly out the door isn't giving the new establishment much of a chance.

La Condesa is located on 16th Street, just north of McDowell, in a neighborhood that's no stranger to tasty Mexican food, including Tortas El Guero and the popular Barrio Cafe.

With no shortage of good Mexican food, how does a new place stand out? They do things their own way.

You'll notice striking artwork on the walls. The art is beautifully lit, and from a visual standpoint it's hard to look away, that's until you see the salsa bar.

Once you place your order at the counter, you're given a number. Then have a seat and a staffer will deliver a basket of crunchy chips. This is when the fun begins, tapping that salsa bar.

On each of my visits, the salsa line up was never quite the same, with at least six to choose from. Standouts include an Avocado Salsa that was vibrant and flavorful, the chunky salsa Mexicano and the Creamy Cilantro Salsa.

If you run out of chips they will refill your basket, but try not to fill up on chips while you wait for your food, because you will indeed wait, and wait, and wait... On each of my visits the kitchen took from 15 to 45 minutes to deliver my order. But don't let this discourage you because some things are worth waiting for.

The tacos are served on two 6-inch corn tortillas. You can order tacos ala carte ($2.99 each) or as a two taco plate ($6.99) with rice and beans.

The beer battered Cabo Shrimp version was hot and fresh, yet perfectly crunchy while leaving the shrimp moist and tender. The Sonoran Carne Asada had a great flavor but was more like jerky, tough and dry.

Burritos were mostly a miss, while paying a premium ($7.29). You can choose shrimp or mahi mahi. Mine were filled with too much rice and not enough seafood.

However the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Burro ($6.99) was an absolute killer. Filled with luscious roasted pork shoulder, it was so tender you don't need teeth to eat it.

The handmade Corn-Quesa is going to bring me back. They take fluffy corn masa and fold it around your selection of fillings, then use their deep frying to create a unique and substantial alternative to tacos and burritos.

Being a purist, the Traditional Quesa ($5.49) was one of my favorites, simply filled with gooey Oaxaca cheese.

The same Oaxaca cheese is paired with the earthy flavors of mushrooms in the Maria Sabina Quesa ($6.99).

For me, the thing to order is the Azteca Tinga Quesa ($7.29). Stuffed with shredded chicken, tomato, onion and chipotle sauce, the flavors were complex and each bite was sheer bliss.

Service is friendly and on some nights you might even see the owner's kids helping out."}
{"text":"This place would be five stars, but the service is slow.  If you see a nearly empty restaurant, do not assume that things will be speedier.  The servers are friendly and you will be seated promptly, but beyond that  expect a bit of a wait. 

Atmosphere is not the best, its actually a bit dull.  But I do like the decor, which is dia de muerta and graffiti type canvases on the wall, and beautiful solid wood doors that I wish I had at home.

So why four stars?  The food is good!  I have had the Sonoran Carne Asada Taco, Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, Cabo Shrimp Taco, and the Sonora Arrachera Quesa.  They were all very good, but my favorite was the Sonora Arrachera Quesa.  Very fattening, but well worth all the calories.  They have a salsa bar with a diverse array of choices, and I do enjoy the all the exotic options.  Oh and the Horchata is decent.

Unfortunately, I believe they will not last too long.  It is always empty, and they are closing earlier every time I visit.  Maybe location is not the greatest, and the service is sluggish, but I really hope they stick around."}
{"text":"I love the different kinds of tacos here. You can get fancy tacos or simple street tacos. The al pastor street tacos are delicious. The salsa bar is very fun! I am glad they expanded because there was always a wait."}
{"text":"The food is great, the local area is a little on the sketchier side but the salsa bar makes it worth it.

Get the tacos: steak and fish are the best

Ppl do park in the dirt lot next to it if they run out of space. There's also an asian market you can park at and walk if need be."}
{"text":"We came here because of the great yelp review the restaurant have but I think I may have visited this place at a wrong time. First of, we weren't acknowledged when my family and I came in. We wasn't sure if we were supposed to choose our own seating or someone would assign one. Took about 5-10 mins for the server to ask if we wanted something to drink. She the brought the chips and most of the salsa are out and not being replenished at the salsa bar. All three women servers are walking around and passing us like we have not been waiting for 40 minutes for one order. I had to really wave at the server to get her attention. The order finally came in after waiting for 1 hour and to top it off, the server handed us our food without any apologies for the long wait and not even an eye contact. I'm all about customer service and if I was to based my rating on their service that night, it would be a 1 star. The food was great tho, but definitely not worth waiting an hour especially when the restaurant is not even pack."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in a long time. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time here tonight. So delicious! Loved the salsa bar. Loved my tacos and husband loved his burrito! Wish we lived closer and could add this place more often."}
{"text":"The food is always great,  I have been here maybe 5 times and only one of those times were we waited on in a timely manner.  They drop the menu off and then go away for at least 10-15 minutes.  For some reason the wait staff refuses to write down any orders.  I'd rather they write them down instead of getting them wrong. The lack of staff is the downfall of this place.  Can't deny the meat and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this restaurant and thought it was time I gave a review. The Santisima shrimp tacos are to die for - simple as that. Everything I've ever had here has been flavorful and uniquely delicious, and the homemade salsa bar is the icing on the cake. The only criticism I can offer is that they're a bit on the slow side in terms of bringing out food, particularly for to-go orders if you don't call ahead, but I can't blame them for being busy or successful!"}
{"text":"The La Santisima Specialty Taco was delicious. Best ever.

The Salsa Bar is amazing. 

I'm going to bring my friends back here.

The owner called me by name, that felt good. This was my first visit."}
{"text":"ordered:
- taco trio
- quesa
- burro
- horchata w/ fruits and pecans [best drink ever]

pros:
- amazing salsas, the pecan salsa and one of the spicy ones stood out to me
- quesa was crispy/ cheesy goodness, can't have a normal quesadilla again
- portions were large

cons:
- located in a seedy area
- service is a little slow"}
{"text":"Great service. The best actually. I'm not familiar with Mexican food and the staff were very helpful and and polite. The staff, as well as the food made this eat out trip great."}
{"text":"Santisima is still a great restaurant, though the wait times are still long and they could use some improvement with increased wait staff. The mole quesadilla with chicken is delicious as is the horchata which delightfully has cinnamon, fruit and chopped nuts to accent the flavor. The prices have gone up, which is a pity. The expansion next door has opened up the space which makes seating easier though you still have to wait a bit too long to get your order (worth it though...the food is delicious) Still love the artwork and decor which is based on Mexican La Lllorona and Day of the Dead themes. Alan our waiter was fantastic, personable, and hard working. Would give place 5 stars if they could just get more efficient between seating time and getting served the meal."}
{"text":"Dropped by La Santisima on a Friday afternoon around 1:00 pm to grab a late lunch. Initially, I had a bit of a hard time finding the place, but it was bit easier to see once I located the parking lot behind it. There was plenty of seating inside and we were given water and a giant bowl of chips after we were seated. In terms of food, I literally cannot start talking about anything else before I rave about the salsa bar. There are literally 10+ selections of salsa from guacamole salsa to sesame salsa and more typical salsas like salsa verde. I went berserk getting a bunch of the salsas and tried a good deal of them. It also helped that they gave us a giant heaping pile of chips to try all the salsa with. 

In terms of actual food, I got the La Santisima Veggie taco and the Mexica Ahuacatl taco. My friend on the other hand had the 3 taco plate with rice and beans. Both of the tacos I ordered were guuureat though I did like the La Santisima Veggie taco a lot more than the Mexica Ahuacatl. I did steal a bite of my friend's rice and beans and it was also super delicious! My friend enjoyed all 3 of his tacos (2 meat, 1 fish) even though his order was slightly incorrect. Overall, the food was great and service was good. The only downside was that they didn't have the guacamole when we went! Definitely need to go back and try it!"}
{"text":"we love fish tacos, but find it hard to find good, \"authentic\" ones near our house without paying scottsdale prices. i've heard of La Condesa, but since it's out of our \"circle of convenient driving distance\" we never think of it. 

thanks to the wife, we were all set to meet some friends here last night. we first noticed that is an actual sit-down restaurant. i assumed with all the hype, it would be a grungy, post-soviet area looking eatery (re: carolina's), but no....it was nice inside, replete with some beautiful dia de los muertos paintings. 

we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table to open up. once seated, we were brought a jug of water and some chips. then the fun began! trying out each one of the approx 15 salsa's at their salsa bar. i liked many of them, but wound up going back to the traditional salsa and pico. of note, the cilantro, pecan, and strawberry salsa's were good, but only for a few dips. 

i ordered one each of the shark, the shrimp, and the veggie tacos. they are small but packed with flavor. so juicy, they come stacked on 2 small corn tortillas. i actually savored the veggie and the shrimp instead of wolfing them down. both very tasty with that mexican sauce they put on them, and the fried shrimp were perfect...not caked in batter, but just a light dusting. i didn't get to the shark ones because i was so full, so it's in our fridge waiting to be eaten. i also ordered a margarita...it was rather delicious!

there are so many choices of tacos, burritos (with/without the tortilla) and fajitas...and several for veg heads. it's difficult to pick 2...which is why we must definitely go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best fish taco in Phoenix by far! I have ordered other things on the menu but the best thing is definitely the fish taco. Chips and salsa bar are great as well. 

Also, one of the best horchatas I have ever had. The restaurant is pretty small though so sometimes its hard to get a seat if it's busy."}
{"text":"We tried three different tacos (chicken/shrimp/veggie) ... they were great !!! Also the margarita mamasita was amazing."}
{"text":"Between the friendly atmosphere, the cost seating, and the to die for tacos - this place is truly five stars. You would be lost in Phoenix without their salsa bar. I absolutely recommend making your way to this taco haven."}
{"text":"food was pretty alright.  the menu is quite extensive, it can overload people if they don't really know what they want.  I had to ask for suggestions since there was so much going on.  the hostess/server made a couple suggestions for me though, and i was pleased with what i received.

the organization with staff though really needs to be improved like others have said.  all the servers and hostesses appear to be college aged girls yet they don't seem to know what's going on when the place gets crowded.  after i had been seated, we still waited 20 minutes for someone to take our order and it wasn't even the server that's supposed to take our table.  it was the hostess that took our order and told us \"our\" server would be by with out food.

i like the food, not the disorganization though"}
{"text":"Seriously fantastic. Friendly. Delicious. Salsa bar. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Really good street tacos, the spicy chicken and spicy pork were awesome! Def a true az Mexican taco shop! Will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"A happy series of events led me here when I had initially planned to go somewhere else and I am so glad that I did. The tacos are amazing, of course. My personal favorite was the mole taco but it's hard to pick just one because everything I had was so good. Wonderful interior décor and a very relaxed and intimate atmosphere. I fully intend to come here as often as I can. Oh, and the horchata was phenomenal. All in all, easily the best taco place I have been to."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and my girlfriend found this little taco place. The tacos here are pretty darn good. She and I split a shrimp taco, carne asada taco and a pork taco. They were all pretty tasty. They have a bunch of homemade salsas but none really knocked my socks off. I tried five different salsas hoping one would catch my attention but I was kinda disappointed. Luckily the tacos were really good."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure why this place has so many reviews. I try to be nice about reviews cause I know how this effects various businesses. We went here on a Saturday night (group of 9); and before I even decided to rate this place.... I went around asking the entire crew what they would rate this place ... all of them either said 1 or 1.5 out of 5 stars.. When we got in, we had to wait for 45 mins to get a table... I mean that's understandable given the fact that we were a large group... once seated.... everything is just so slow. We ordered and the food literally took about 45-50 mins to come out. That's way too long. The waitress was nice. (only reason why I'm giving them a one star). I advise this business to give chips for free since the wait is so long. Anyways, overall ... not too happy with the service.. and the food wasn't all that at all. There's a lot better Mexican restaurants around!"}
{"text":"The menu is overwhelming and bursting with options. My friends were disappointed that quite a few of the selections weren't available. The burritos were mostly rice and the quesadilla was deep fried which was light on filling and mostly fried dough. BUT. My tacos were great. Really really very good. And the salsa bar was a really cool concept full of many different flavors. The service was poor and at times we though our server was kind of rude. I would go back for sure. But o my to stick with the tacos. Take the service with a grain of salt and you'll be fine"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and Mexican food in a very small settings.  The only limitation is its size which adds to the charm. The food is amazing service is good and the salsa bar will help you explore aside to salsa you never knew existed."}
{"text":"I had a pastor street taco and it was damaging! Very tasty! I also ordered a steak quesadilla but it was nothing like the quesadilla I know...it looked like a calzone...the dough tasted a little weird but the filling was delish!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We had the horchata, a burrito, and an assortment of tacos.  As mentioned by others it is a smaller space, but the service is fast and good. They also load you up with chips and the salsa bar has a great variety of things to try. You can snack away some of your hunger if you are starved."}
{"text":"I stumbled across La Santisima as I was street art hunting nearby. I had read some reviews so I decided to drop in. The salsa bar is a lot of fun with a ton of options. I had 4 tacos. The grilled shark, delicious. The specialties, fully loaded. Mole, rich chocolaty goodness. And Gaucho, Argentina steak with a vinegar twist. Everything was a delight and modern. The tortillas were excellent and I ate way too many chips. I highly recommend going."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service!! If you plan on coming here during your lunch hour I recommend you call ahead. Wait time can be a bit lengthy if you have limited time. The people here are friendly and very professional."}
{"text":"Yum, tacos... Ok the thing that stood out the most was how fresh everything was. The salsa bar..a definite plus... I love a good salsa... My favorite the Strawberry Salsa.  Wholy cow was that good! The quesadilla was bigger than I've ever seen I couldn't finish it!!  Loved, loved loved the artwork, The only negative I could find was that the furniture for some reason felt a little awkward like I was in everyone's way while they were trying to get in line to order, but that really has nothing to do with the food.  I'm givin' this place a thumbs up... authentic and delicioso!"}
{"text":"yep...pretty much my new favorite taco shop in the valley...I tend to stay away from beef so carne asada holds no appeal for me...BUT this place has a little bit more of a variety of tacos-I had the Oaxaca black mole chicken shark taco and the mole was the perfect mix-just spicy enough....and the salsa bar made me giddy!  I can't wait to go back. YUM!"}
{"text":"Another review by BAM

All these great tastes...let me start with the sautéed Spinach...Spinach, What? That's right.

I'm RUINED. I can never have another taco without thinking of this beautiful gastronomic experience, deep in one of the hood. I will never be the same.

{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were watching Diners, Drive ins, and Dines when Guy stopped here. We realized they were about 15 minutes away so we thought to check it out. It's a tiny little hole in the wall place that has about 10 tables. It can get kind of cramped but it is definitely worth it when that food hits your tongue. This place has the best mexican food! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of how tiny it is and the fact that you have to pay $2.40 to get extra chips. Aside from this, this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Ok so my friend hyped this place up pretty high. \"Best tacos ever\". I thought, yea right. But he wasn't kidding. Awesome salsa bar. Vegetarian options. Only drawback is the seating (our table was uneven/wobbly and it was a bit crowded- close together tables and pretty much full)"}
{"text":"My review if for take out only, I have never dined in, this is the place for some heavy duty take out burros.And when I say heavy duty, be prepared for a couple of burros in that bag to weigh about 3-4 pounds. The burros are so big, you will have 2 meals in one (so it makes up for the price)  AWESOME food!!! Best bean and cheese burritos in town (The Bullet Burro) hubby orders the Mariachi Loco Burro. I love their guacamole salsa."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place and was excited to try it. Went for lunch on a Sunday, wasn't too busy. Was promptly seated and brought chips and order was taken. Very nice salsa bar with a lot of different salsas and big vegetarian menu. I ordered 3 different vegetarian tacos. 40 minutes later, food had still not arrived. By the time it finally did, the food looked great, until I noticed there were 3 pieces of hair in my food. Ended up leaving hungry. Can't believe that after a nearly a 50 minute wait, I was served food with hair in it. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Mexican food that I have had outside of Monterrey, MX! We were waited on by the owner and we had 5 star service. We will be back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"O M G ! ! !
Not what I was expecting. An absolute delight from the moment I walked in the door. Do not miss the salsa bar. What amazing flavors they concocted. Each one unique and complex in flavor. I had the steak sandwich. I understand they make the bread there. It was fresh with a moist and firm inside and a crisp yet delicate crust. The meat was prepared in a way I have never had before but dying to go back and have again. A balance of flavors. I can't wait to go back !!! This place is AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California for the weekend. We found this gem on Yelp and thought we would see what the hype was all about. 

We ordered a cadillac Margarita, skinny Margarita, queso funido, fish taco, shrimp taco, carne asada burrito bowl and EVERYTHING was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!

We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Small little restaurant w/ parking in the back. Great food, cabo shrimp tacos are amazing and they have one of the most unique salsa bars for any mexican restaurant i have been to. About 15 different varieties of salsa to try. Will definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I was totally blown away with La Santisima. 

The salsa bar was top notch. Over a dozen to choose from, each delicious. The pico de gallo was some of the best I've had. A creamy guacamole and a cilantro sauce were highlights as well. 

The tacos were phenomenal. Each topped with salsa and garnish that complimented perfectly. Even the beans and rice were incredible. So much flavor in such traditionally simple sides. 

The interior is fun and quirky, decorated with luchadors, sugar skulls and other interesting Mexican art."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite mexican place of all time! Big cheesy chimis, huge burritos and tacos with the tastiest mexican fillings. My favorite is the Mayan Cochinita Pibil, so good Johnny Depp would've shot him dead in Once Upon a Time in Mexico! haha Seriously so good, plus they give you chips with endless salsa! My secret is to mix the spicy green salsa with the creamy cilantro! I love this restaurant so much I would marry it! lol"}
{"text":"Are you tired of, or bored with, the typical Sonoran fare that surrounds us on nearly every corner in the valley?  If so, then you need to put one of the two locations of La Santisima on your list. The only things that you would recognize are the usage of the words: tortilla, taco, quesadilla, and burro. It's that unique. 

I've eaten more times than I can count at 16th St, and several times in Glendale. Here's what you need to know between the two. The original 16th St is small, almost cramped. Parking is literally ON the street edge, and around the corner. It can be dangerous backing out of your spot into the northbound flow of 16th St. You will often find a wait to be seated, and there is no indoor waiting area, just a bench outside, and seating for perhaps six at the (full liquor) bar. You will more than likely be privy to your your neighboring diners' conversations, as well as bumping into them at the salsa bar. It's got wonderful ambience, certainly, but it's not for large-parties, or those having issues with claustrophobia, or anxiety that might be sparked due to tight quarters. Those using wheelchairs or scooters should go directly to Glendale. There is ample parking in the rear, and at neighboring venues. The dining room is at least twice, or thrice, that of 16th st, and there is patio seating along Glendale, outside. I've not ever had to wait there, due to the extra seating available. 

The salsa bar gets much praise from other reviewers, and I'll get that out of the way first. Yes, there are a dozen, or perhaps 14 choices there. However, batches are kept small for freshness, and they may not have a couple of your faves once you've discovered them. However, there will certainly be ample remaining choices to top your light, airy, housemade(?) chips. Your first basket is gratis, but they do charge for extras (sometimes, LOL). It's very, VERY easy to ruin your appetite with these, due to the wonderful tastes and combos that you simply have not likely seen elsewhere. Chopped jicama, lightly salted w/cilantro? A roasted combo of several different peppers, and onions? Watermelon salsa? Peanut mole? You get the idea....

The menu lays out their special recipe combos pretty well. You can certainly get a standard type street taco plate, with or w/o rice and beans, with several of their takes on the standards, such as carne asada, al pastor, etc. The rice is simple, yet not your standard rosa-colored 'Spanish' rice. It even appealed to a former Asian g/f, who ate plain white rice as a staple. Beans are on the creamy side, more 'refried' than charro style....again quite tasty for their type. However, I almost always succumb to one of their bowls. All can be ordered as burro wrapped in a large tortilla, but I always get a bowl. Afterall, I know I will be semi-full from those chips! I've had the House Special bowl more times than I can remember, and it does not disappoint. But, I've explored out of my comfort zone a time or two, without disappointment. 
Quesadillas come in a large fresh corn tortilla, unlike anything I've ever seen at another restaurant. That adds a unique texture and flavor to their already delicious fillings. However, if you think you would be put-off by it somehow, be sure you specify that you wish to have a traditional flour tortilla.

I have to make a special plug for their guacamole. Like other recipes, this one is unique, and  darned yummy. They add cranberry, jicama, and I believe mango to your standard avocado blending. It's creamy green nirvana. Well worth that second basket of chips, for sure. Don't plan on sharing a small serving with any more than one other diner. Otherwise, violence could very well break out at your table. 

Well then, it's time for dessert. This is perhaps the only reason I am hesitant to provide them with 5-stars. Frustration! Their take on a leche flan is quite different than what you're used to (that's the theme here, right?). Picture more of a tres-leches sponge-cake, because that's what it is (in my book), and what it should be called (to my thinking, LOL). Suffice to say, in the many times I've eaten here, it's been sold-OUT all but ONE TIME!!!!  I even ask for it BEFORE I ORDER MY MEAL, just in the hopes of reserving one for myself at the end. No such luck, LOL. 

Alright, it's time to go eat!"}
{"text":"Their quesadillas and shrimp tacos were amazing!  The horchata was almost like a fruit cocktail...very different, but still delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Loved their unique gastro tacos. 
Gluten free friendly - they have GF on the menu for all their allergy friendly items. 
Solid house margarita on the rocks.
I got the andalucia taco, pork tapatio taco, and the Azteca tinga taco. 
*Loved* the andalucia taco: chorizo & potatoes is an amazing combination. The azteca taco was a very delicious & unique chicken taco."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, I got the Tapatio quesa which is a deep fried quesadilla, with adobo pork. There is a salsa bar which is nice and the first basket of chips is free and then if you want chips after that it's $2.79. The service was not great, we were sitting down for a long time before anyone asked us if we wanted drinks or anything, I had to ask someone to take our order and my friend had to go to the drink area herself to get her margarita because the waiter never went to get it. Poor service, good food."}
{"text":"While there is very little to be said that hasn't been already, you simply can't go wrong with tacos. Just point at random at the taco section and you'll be happy.

The salsa bar is full of types that I didn't even know existed. Almond salsa? Load it up! 

Make sure you come before lunch/dinner time if you want to get seated/don't want to eat off your lap."}
{"text":"La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop 

After a long break from Yelp, I knew that eventually I would find myself in a situation where I could no longer hold my tongue, and my need to share would overpower my desire to remain silent. La Condesa GTS created just that situation. 

I entered this space wound tighter than a spring ready to pop. Surely there could be no way that it could meet the lofty expectations set forth by my fellow yelper's reviews. But there is something very pure about this place, and as I stepped through the over-sized wood door, I knew this southwest girl was home. 

The best way I can describe the atmosphere is Southwestern Minimalist. Monique H was dead on with her praises for the artwork - The Blue Demon (long live Alejandro Muñoz Moreno) proudly intermingles with Diego and Frida and the acid treated floors feel natural. I also liked that this is clearly a community effort, with the art work provided by two exceptional Mexican artists (Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez) and the furniture/décor provided by Bellas Artes de Mexico. I love that there is already a partnership, holding this little gem up until it can take flight. 

The food is clean. The flavors crisp. The portions more than adequate, and the prices less than I would expect to pay for such quality. Most selections can come in the form of a taco, a quesadilla, or a burro, although there are one or two additional options under both the quesadilla and burro menus. Each flavor combination is clearly described and in a handful of situations, there are salsa suggestions outlined on the out of this world salsa bar. The best way I can describe this is to think of a wine pairing with a food that will make flavors pop... in other words, just try it because the sum of the parts is way better than the individual components! 

The Mayan Conchita Pibil and the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken are two of the finest examples I've had of either. Both are mouth wateringly moist and fairly melt. I would suggest the Peanut or Mexican salsa as additional choices for the MCP for the spicy recommended habanera. The guacamole and cilantro salsas were both mild choices and if the mole were not already a mouthful of perfection, might be the additional layer of flavors that bring you to the tipping point. Personally, I found the pickled onions severed atop with some of the Jicama salsa, tossed in for a little crunch, just enough to make my eyes roll back in to my head. I mean seriously, if I could wiggle around naked in this stuff, it would be a really good night! The Aztec Tinga is deceptively simple. Your first bite may seem relatively ordinary, but then start the countdown. Within a few seconds, the flavors hit you like a wall of emotion. Your lips and tongue begin to tingle with the heat of the perfectly balanced peppers. My BIL has tried the Sonoran Carne Asada and was unusually quiet as he made his way through his plate, so I have to assume that was good as well. Finish things up with those out of the world beans, or some of the grilled Mexican Calabacitas and a meal just can't get much better. 

So much has already been said about the iconic salsa bar, there really isn't much I can add, except to say, try them all! You will find two or three that send you to your happy place. 

The staff was super friendly and more than ready to answer questions or make suggestions. It's an order at the counter and take-a-number kind of place, but you can generally expect several service passes through the dining room. 

My only cautions / suggestions would be to grab a takeout menu so you don't have to stand and look at the wall menu with your mouth gaping like a cod fish and be prepared to park along Palm if the street inset parking area is full. 

This is my new love. I will definitely be adding this in to the regular rotation. At a dinner plate with drink running you between 8 and 9 dollars (with enough food to make two decent sized meals) this is one indulgence I can fit in to my life with little or no rationalizing. Please take the time to check this place out and support yet another wonderful family owned business. Look around when you come in, because I may be joining Joel L on one of his weekly visits. : )"}
{"text":"Nice variety of salsas. I had the shrimp tacos and they were delicious. The place is very small and only had two servers for dinner. They were nice though. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Lunchtime out with a relative on a weekday, and La Condesa has a seat by the window. There is really nothing like its saloon-artsy walls for us to gaze.   The Dia De los Muertos motif and wooden furniture make it perfect for easy conversation.  
Most folks seated around us already know where to go for lunch that's not too pricey and homemade.  
The Horchata is nothing short of liquid dessert, filled with pecans, fruit and rice milk.  You can avoid dairy all together with this and a special bullet burro with guac and lettuce.
The salsa bar sets the standard for good restaurants.  It's wide variety of salsas leave little doubt what creative people run the place.  My hope is that only a few people read this and try it. Otherwise, to my chagrin, the next time we park on 16th Street, we may have to WAIT in a line outside."}
{"text":"The tacos were amazing!!! When you step inside you'll think you are in Mexico. Everything from the art to the bar is authentic. The salsa bar has so many exotic selections that you will salivate over. The menu even caters to vegetarians. The tacos and burros are amazing. I will be a regular here and you should be too! Oh yeah and Alfredo makes killer margs!"}
{"text":"Delicious Food and I'm a harsh critic since I only love authentic Mexican food! The fresh waters are to die for!! But the great music and amazing art to top it off to make this a great choice to eat!!! Oh and more choices it salsas you can imagine and they are all finger licking good!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to take people for tacos. Great vegetarian options as well as great variety of traditional and contemporary Mexican food. It's small inside but the service is quick."}
{"text":"Went in on a weekend, was pretty busy, but got a seat pretty quickly, about 10 min wait tops. We were very impressed with the salsa bar, makes it so whatever flavor your looking for to enhance your food with that this can be self-done :P
Ordered the chicken shark mole taco, wow! that was yummy, had this two weeks ago and the flavor is still etched in my taste-buds memory! Over all the dinner was excellent, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Fresh ingredients that don't hide under heavy sauces. Great alternative to the regular taco shops."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town!! Their traditional Quesadillas are delicious and are the Chicken Mole tacos & Al Pastor tacos!!!!! This is making me hungry now!!!"}
{"text":"If you have all the time in the world and love to be ignored by your server then go here. 
Seriously, I've been to the Flagstaff location and hands down it deserves 5 stars. Phoenix location, not so much. 
We expected a bit of a wait on a Friday night. What we didn't expect for a party of two after waiting 30 minutes in a half full restaurant was to finally get a table only to be ignored. It took another 40 minutes for someone to take our order. This was after the bar couldn't understand we wanted two drinks. 
The food is good but not so good that you can't get equally good food along with good service elsewhere. 
The cauliflower, peanut salsa taco is good. My second taco wasn't the right order. I waited some more. When the beer batter avocado taco arrived it was a bit bland. Good texture but not a lot of flavor. My boyfriend ordered the pork and pineapple burro. It didn't have any pineapple in it. Pork was minimal. It relied mostly on the filler of lettuce and onion. 
Disappointing."}
{"text":"Food if excellent; unique and yet authentic flavored. It's all oversized burritos and quesadillas (corn masa and fried, excellent!) as well as many variety of tacos. Well worth the $, and the margaritas are excellent to match with some unique offerings. The  tamarind is a good one."}
{"text":"Drop what you're doing and drive here. After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.  The food is that good.

This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the \"Grand Opening\" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!

It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!

As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist."}
{"text":"The La Santisima Quesa is absolutely delicious!  I crave it all the time.  Order it, you won't be disappointed.  

In my opinion, this is the best restaurant within a 10 mile radius of downtown Glendale. It has the best margaritas, tacos, salsa bar and service.  I tipped off my buddy Jason V. to this place and now he's the duke.  It's goooooood."}
{"text":"Have been here several times as it's within walking distance to my home.  Service and food has always been good.  Some evenings it gets pretty packed and things slow down, but, it's not fast food, so take your time and relax.  This is definitely one of the better quality Mexican places in the valley and it's nice to not have food completely covered in oil and salt, which is what many of the Mexican places think Americans want.
It good tasty fair where you can actually taste the ingredients."}
{"text":"Was is good.. Yes
Did it blow me away.. No

I arrived here about 4:45pm Monday evening. It was me and the photographer for AZ Republic. 

I look over the menu and the salsa bar and man did it look good. I was hoping there was a sample platter or something but the best I could come up with was the 2 Taco meal. 

I opted for the Chicken and the pork, one of each. 

What I liked: 
-Chips with out having to order them separate.  
-Tacos full of meat. 
-Staff was nice
-Rice and Beans were good. 
-The salsa bar...way cool

Meh:  
-Corn shell was overcooked on 1/2 (one side)
-meat was boring without salsa, good thing there is like 20 to choose. 


It seems like the upscaled two hippies and it worked! 3.5 out of 4"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, especially the street tacos. But the bell of the restaurant is the mole- Yummy - as good as mole from Oaxaca! The salsa bar is to die for, you got to try them all."}
{"text":"Came as a recommendation by a friend that visited here when he was in Phoenix.
I also had to come because there was HAPPY HOUR and UNLIMITED SALSA.

TINGA STREET TACO ($1.25)
- wasn't too spicy
- very well marinated
- I originally only ordered 1 but couldn't resist and ordered another one soon after I finished the first one!

CARNE ASADA STREET TACO ($1.25)
- meat was relatively tender
- good but definitely preferred the Tinga Street Taco more

MARGARITA ($3)
- not too strong that it tasted like alcohol but there was definitely alcohol in there.
- good drink to help celebrate the beginning of the weekend. 

HORCHATA ($3.99)
- VERY GOOD
- different from any horchata I had before; it had dices of cantaloupe, honeydew, and strawberry
- super large thirst quencher

UNLIMITED SALSA BAR
- any salsa from strawberry, cilantro, pecan, or pico de gallo
- I almost tried everything because well I've never been to a place with so much variety
- it also helped that I had unlimited chips so I just kept trying

SERVICE: nothing too special. Staff members were friendly and refilled my water appropriately.

ENVIRONMENT: a bit hidden in a not so great part of Phoenix. There is the large signage that you know it's not the wrong place. The place doesn't get too busy which was good.

Overall, great place for tacos. I can't compare it to other places in Phoenix but I did enjoy my visit. They are a bit different than the tacos I have in LA Taco Trucks mainly because I get different kinds. The price is reasonable and well UNLIMITED SALSA BAR! Also try the horchata...it's so refreshing!"}
{"text":"Awesome salsa bar and SHARK tacos!! You rarely see the words \"gourmet\" and \"taco\" in the same sentence, but La Condesa somehow makes it work. However, La Condesa isn't in the best part of town, and I'm glad we came here for lunch versus dinner. We tried:

-Different Salsas from Salsa Bar (Pecan Salsa, Pico de Gallo, Mexican Salsa, Sesame Salsa, Cilantro Salsa, Grilled Peppers, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-condesa-gourmet-taco-shop-phoenix-2?select=ytgVAxv6hFuPzqsPxwQmhg#ytgVAxv6hFuPzqsPxwQmhg): I liked the Pecan and Sesame salsas although I didn't get much pecan taste. The cilantro was too watery, but the grilled peppers were really good (and had a nice spicy kick). The pico de gallo was solid, as was the mexican salsa. Their tortilla chips are really good, and thin and crispy, so make sure you try them!
-Tacos (From L to R: Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, Carnitas Street Taco, Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-condesa-gourmet-taco-shop-phoenix-2?select=ytgVAxv6hFuPzqsPxwQmhg#Wah_j9kHBXGf2NluqFZB_g): 
-Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco (Roasted Pork Shoulder w/Achiote Rojo, Wrapped in Banana Leaves, Slow-Cooked Until Fork Tender and Topped w/Lime Marinated Onions & Salsa Habanera Maya): I ordered this since a lot of other people seemed to like it, and it was a \"Yucatan specialty\". However, it was just ok. The pork was a little dry, and the flavors didn't stand out. I wouldn't order this again.
-Carnitas Street Taco: Pretty good! The carnitas were very flavorful, and I liked how bite sized this taco was. 
-Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco (Corn Tortilla Stuffed w/Beer Battered Dogfish Shark): DELICIOUS! I've had shark meat before and am used to it being tougher and firmer than regular fish. However, there wasn't a big different in the texture, but there seemed to be more of a sweetness to it. I guess I enjoyed the \"Baja Sur specialty\" vs. the Yucatan. This is a must order if you go to La Condesa!

I only saw a small strip of parking available in front of the restaurant, but it is shared with a convenience store. I think street parking was also available, but I'd recommend making sure you don't have any valuables out! I definitely plan on coming back to La Condesa and trying their other seafood tacos, but will make sure it's during lunch. Dining in is the way to go so that you can sample all of the different salsas. The staff was nice, but weren't the quickiest."}
{"text":"So recent trip to Phoenix and I was craving Mexican food.  Turned to YELP and they pointed us towards this little gem.  Uber took us out there....ummmm a kind of sketchy area but what the heck.  Put our name in and waited about 45 minutes to get seated (place is small). Once seated we ordered margaritas and had chips with the amazing salsa bar!  There have to be 30 salsas freshly prepared.....from mild to OMG that's hot.  My favorite was the Pecano......sooo yummy. 

        Ordered food and I chose the Mole (Black Oaxacan Mole) in burrito form.   I will say that was a damn good Mole.....probably in my top 2 that I have had.  Burrito was big and I love that they make the tortilla crispy by flattening the burrito on the flat top.  Wow soooo good. Came with rice and beans.  A wonderful plate for sure.  

       So if you go it's tiny.....there will be a wait BUT it is sooooo worth it.  I'm from San Diego so I do know great Mexican food and this was GREAT.  Inexpensive as well.  Give them a shot.....you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My new \"Comfort Food\" favorite! If you like varying the taste of your favorite dishes this is your place! Light up your palette with multiple savory salsas and match them up to a plethora of uniquely prepared gourmet tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. 
I had the Mayan Conchinita Pibil Quesadilla, which is pure decadence all by itself. However, I paired a few bites with their fresh guacamole and one of the kickin salsas.  (Something with Cabo in the name, or the other one that looked very similar). While the presentation was beautiful, I started to break through the paper lining the basket. That grosed me out a little, but by then I was full and bagged the rest for later."}
{"text":"The horchata is remarkable!!! No one makes it like this place!!! I love that they also have a huge salsa bar."}
{"text":"Off the charts delicious and menu is extensive and unique. Best occixicana tacos ever. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food is EXCELLENT! The salsa bar is outrageous. Hands down best mexican food we've had."}
{"text":"The best - Salsas, Flavors, Fast Service.  Most excellent."}
{"text":"This place was so totally awesome and unique. My girlfriend and I are visiting from Colorado and this place was recommended by a local and damn did we get lucky. The food was amazing and our waiter Abraham was super kind and took great care of us even though it was busy. The burritos and the salsa bar were out of this world amazing!"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast on Sunday.  The huevos ahogados were an absolute life changer.  I recently relocated from Dallas to Phoenix, and was looking for a change of pace, as far as Mexican food is concerned.  This place is so authentic and the people there are really helpful.  

This place is now a staple in my short list of amazing spaces."}
{"text":"Overall, a great experience. 

Friendly customer service. The server talked to us for a good while, telling us the whole Guy Fieri story. 

Good food. I ordered my usual Carne Asada burrito. No complaints there.

Fantastic salsa. Yes, a whole stand with several different and innovative salsas to choose from. From strawberry to peanut butter to mango, that really was the highlight of our visit.

I recommend this place to all Mexican food lovers."}
{"text":"My only complaint was the guacamole was not how I typically prefer it. Otherwise, this was delicious food and we loved all the salsa choices! There were so many and each one was delicious."}
{"text":"I have to say, this was good- the dead lady on top was not inviting, and the inside was very modest and small, but for the price and food, I will go back. Can not go during rush hour, so go either earlier or later since the place is as small as a broom closet.

{"text":"Great little gem for authentic Mexican food tucked away in a small building on 16th Street.  They have great service, a comfortable atmosphere and an amazing salsa bar! We tried the smoked Marlin and El Gaucho tacos. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Amazing salsa bar selection, fresh ingredients, very flavorful, mouthwatering tacos. A great dining experience for me and the work gang. Totally worth the drive from downtown Tempe. Can't wait to return. Mmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Holy $#!+!! Best tacos and margarita I have ever had... get the Cadillac, baby shark tacos and mariachi loco. Wow... wish I had this place near my home. #Legit"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have tried horchata, and it was delicious. I love the cinnamon taste of it. They serve the drink in a plastic cup, so you can conveniently take it togo. 

Before the main course, they give out complimentary chips you can munch on. The chips are quality chips - they're not the thin ones like from Rubio's. The best part is the salsa bar! They have a wide selection. Watch out for the extra spicy ones. I'm definitely returning to this cute hole in the wall place for good tacos and horchata.  

A heads up that parking in front of the restaurant is limited."}
{"text":"I was very excited that today was my father's birthday as it gave me the opportunity to spend quality time with him....oh and try out this great restaurant. :) After inspecting many of the great reviews, I was thinking that this establishment could not be as good as advertised but it was. From the amazing salsa bar to the great fish tacos, the food here was very, very good. As many have mentioned, the salsa bar has many options to choose from and each has its own authentic flare. For lunch today I ordered the carne asada and shark taco, that came with beans and rice. The fish and carna were so flavorful. In my opinion, you know when you are eating good Mexican food based on how tasty a fish taco is and theirs was great. To go with my meal I ordered their horchata that many yelpers have raved about. I love horchata but sadly I can not list theirs as a favorite. I am more of a simple guy when it comes to this speciality drink and having pecans and strawberries in it just was a little much for me. You may ask how I could still give it five stars but if you had the opportunity to try all of the other items that I tasted they more than made up for it. Overall, very good food and a place that I will definitely be going to in the future. There are many seafood dishes that I look forward to enjoying in the future."}
{"text":"what a disappointment! i've had this place bookmarked for a looooong time, so i was excited when i finally convinced a large group of my friends to dine here.

the salsa bar did not disappoint, so i had higher expectations for the food. my fave salsas were the peanut, the mexicana, and the pibil something or other. the strawberry one tasted like... crushed strawberries. surprise? 

i had the 2 taco plate (~$10).... i had one la condesa special w/ shrimp (spinach, cheese, onions, peppers.... other things?) and one chicken mole. the chicken was tasty, and the tacos are pretty decently portioned.... it was a good thing the shrimp was smothered in cheese because it was SUPER overcooked. you get a teeny portion of rice and beans on the side.

husband got a burrito and taco plate (~$13)... the burrito was the much-hyped cochinita pibil, and the taco was the el gaucho (skirt steak w/ avo and chimichurri). eh. the cochinita pibil was ok, but not \"melt-in-your-mouth\".... and i dunno if beans were the right accompaniment for it. the skirt steak was TOUGH and dry... and there was hardly any chimichurri (if any?) to redeem it.  this combo only comes w/ some calabacitas (squash), no rice.

our table's consensus was that the majority of the meat was dry/overcooked. there was definitely some pleasing flavors, but were made unenjoyable by overcooked, dry meat. 

perhaps it was because we were a large party (9) and it was busy (fri night)... but the service was kinda spotty. they were kind enough to split our bill for us, which was great. it is a very small place, so i wouldn't recommend going in a group larger than 4, maybe 6.

i might be willing to give this place a go again... but for the high prices and based on my lackluster experience, i'm sadly placing la condesa in my \"phoenix over-hyped\" list."}
{"text":"Just had half of a shrimp burro and half of a mahi mahi burro and it was absolutely fabulous. The cilantro sauce and mushrooms made it! A+ Also - best horchata on the planet!"}
{"text":"Yesss. I. Love. Tacos. So I got steak and shrimp gaucho tacos and a mahi taco and wasn't disappointed. It's really pricey and the service was slow, but they made me special salsa that was reaaaallly hot after I asked which salsa from their expansive salsa bar was the hottest since it's all clearly made for gringos. Oh and the sound of the chairs screaming across the floor made me cringe. I seriously doubt that I'll ever eat in the restaurant again. I would totally get to go orders since the tacos were bomb and I want to try other stuff!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. We go to their location on Glendale Avenue.  Love the Salsa bar. We enjoy the burritos. Some people may think the prices are high for tacos and burritos. The quality is worth if!"}
{"text":"Not sure if we went to this one or the other one, but let's just say it' s tiny and rustic on the inside.  We got lucky with parking.  The margs were good, not strong enough, but after 2 I was fine.  The salsa bar was very very good, I wish the containers to hold the salsa were bigger. The lighting is kind of poor, but that adds to the charm.  I had conchinita pibil quesadilla, which I really loved.  My boyfriend had a chicken mole taco and an al pastor taco, which he only liked, not loved.  We would never have found this place if it hadn't been for the locals, so we were grateful.  I would go back, my boyfriend would too, but would order something else."}
{"text":"Just go here. You won't be disappointed.

The atmosphere is cozy and hip with rustic tables and chairs and dia de los muertos artwork lining the walls. The staff is FRIENDLY. I can't emphasize that enough. I have been for lunch and they handle the crowds well. At dinner, and during slower traffic times, they are very attentive and ensure that you have everything you need.

The food. Where do I begin. I will start with the amazing salsa bar. They have about a dozen salsas per day. Fresh. My favorite is the seven chile salsa which is simply roasted chiles and red onions. They are all amazing though.

As far as the tacos, I have only ever eaten the pibil and the mole, and that's because they are so good, that I can't branch out yet. Every time I go, those are the ones I am craving. The pibil is so good that it makes me fully appreciate Johnny Depp's character in \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" having such a love of good pibil. 

If you go at lunch, go before 11:30 to beat the crowd. This is one of my favorite places to eat. Hands down. Get some horchata to go as well. They top it with fruit and pecans. Yum!"}
{"text":"My friend told me this was best Mexican food around. I wasn't hesitant at first because I always believed the best Mexican food in Arizona was in Tucson, but she may be right. La Santísima is fantastic. I had the Azteca Tinga burro, and I don't remember the last time I had chicken that was so juicy. I think their secret is in their sauces/marinades. The burrito was huge but I ate it all up because it was so good and I could not stop. I also love the salsa bar - they have a large variety of salsas and it's fun to try all of them. My favourite is the strawberry one. 

The only downside was that service was slow. I think we waited 15 minutes just for someone to greet us and take our orders. I heard that the restaurant increased capacity so I hope they will increase staff too in order to meet the increased needs."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant because every time we go to a new city we try new places. We like to watch Diners, Drive ins  and Dives and we try some of the places that they mention. This was a mistake. When we first got there, we had to wait even though there were four tables available two partially bussed One was completely cleaned and one was not at all bussed. There was a couple in front of us waiting and they seemed irritated as well. When we finally get seated we go to the back of the restaurant and there was a few tables available. They explained to us that they ran out of ice so that's the reason they were so behind. I'm sorry I don't understand how a restaurant pretty much shut  down because they ran low on ice. So they show us to our table the hostess sets the chips down and says help yourself to the salsa bar. We make our way to the salsa bar and are greeted by a sign that says extra chips are 2.40 or something and a salsa bar that was almost completely empty. We waited 10 minutes decided to go back there was a man standing there and he had mentioned he asked for cups for the salsa a few minutes ago and they still have not returned. Also the salsa was still not refilled. So we ate or chips with no salsa. We also asked for some guacamole prior to going to the salsa bar the second time the waiter said he thought they might be out of guacamole but he wasn't sure he would let us now. 10 minutes later he comes back to take order completely forgetting about the guacamole and when we asked he said yes they were out of guacamole. It was odd the would be out of guacamole and they can't refill their salsa bar but they give you chips and tell you to enjoy the salsa bar. So we order our food and if I'm being honest it's pretty decent the beans are amazing definitely The best beans I've ever had. The rice was really good. I ordered a margarita with a Corona. Usually those come in a margarita glass the Corona upside down in it. This came in a  tall highball glass Filled about a quarter of the way and the corona on the side it was absolutely terrible. And then the server who I will say it was pretty decent gave us our check came back and picked up our cash and the first thing he said is I don't have any change you guys. And I don't know why but  that bugged me really bad because first of all it was only seven dollars and you're a waiter how can you not make change for a customer. We actually didn't want any change but what if we had. All in all it was not A good experience and there were several people in the surrounding tables there also unhappy especially with the salsa bar being so crappy. And I don't understand and I cannot wrap my head around The fact that just because you're out of ice you can't seat people I don't even understand. Maybe they just had a bad day who knows!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place less stars, because the service took so long. It literally took an hour to get our horchata but it was so worth it. It was like nothing I've ever had before!!! This Horchata had melon, strawberries,cinnamon, walnuts and other fresh ingredients that all came together perfectly. They also serve Mexican Coke Cola which is better than regular Cola.

The quesadilla was far from a traditional flour tortilla. It was some kind of a pita tortilla. It was delicious. 

The shrimp tiger tacos were so authentic and cook to perfection. The street tacos taste just like the taco shops in Ensenada Mexico. The rice was cooked with a buttery taste which my taste buds could not refuse and beans were good as well. They have the salsa bar with such a large variety of salsa. The cream salsa, cilantro salsa and the chunky salsa were all wonderful options to put on the shrimp and fish tacos together. 

Believe me I wanted to hate this place, But everything they did wrong like take 40 mins to bring food
Was so worth it. The place is truly a hole in the wall, crowded with many folks from different walks of life. Worth your time and inconvenience to taste such perfection!"}
{"text":"The best salsa bar in life. Delicious vegetarian options, love them."}
{"text":"Tried coming here once. No parking!  They have like 3 parking spots. Its hot as hell outside no one wants to drive around looking for a place to park on a regular Wednesday night.  Maybe if you can walk or ride a bike or a horse it may be worth trying.  Get a  building with more than 3 parking spots and this place could be legit."}
{"text":"Incredible!  Stupendous!  Filling!  And then there's the Margaritas.  

My friend, Kenner Bob, from up Iowa way, was in town for her annual visit to Aridzona and it's my most excellent pleasure to choose the joint for us to brunch and have a smart cocktail, or two (\"Let's all have a little drinkey!\").

I'd spotted La Santisima via Yelp about three months ago and knew immediately I wanted to try it. I'm so glad I waited for Kenner Bob's visit as it turned out to be the perfect place.

We started our culinary journey with the joint's Guacamole. Admittedly, I'm not one for bastardized guac, but this guac was da bomb. Chunky with diced mango, dried cranberries and the usual salt, pepper and garlic. Every bite equated nuclear yummy noises from both of us. 

Kenner Bob chose two tacos (all street sized) from the Mix-n-Match menu:  Mahi-Mahi,  Chicken Tinga (I think) and one from the Specialty section:  a beef brisket number that was sublime. 

I chose the Tiger Shrimp, Chicken Tinga and a Pork taco that escapes my memory.  I loved the Pork number. 

Sides for both of us were the included rice and beans. The rice was buttery and tasted like cream was involved in its making. Scrumdiddleyumptious, it was. I'm a rice fanatic so I could've eaten 20 or six tubfulls.

Trust me when I say it would take at least 20 visits to this joint to work one's way through the menu. Kenner Bob and I took 20 minutes -- whist eating the chips, salsa and guac -- to decide on what to order.  Everything -- and I mean EVERYthing -- sounded delicious.  We could've read every choice's description but we finally had to \"shoot the engineer\" and place our order.  The waitrons are incredibly patient and understanding of dyed-in-the-wool foodies trying to decide which goodies to order. 

The added drawing ticket to this joint are the Margaritas. There are about 10 choices.  Kenner Bob ordered the Award Winning Margarita and after one sip she said, \"I'd vote for it!\"  For Kenner Bob it was the perfect Marg:  sour but not overly so; sweet but not treacly.  

My Marg was incredible. To save my life I can't remember the name of it but it contained an herbal liqueur.  Truly, if this danged ol' cocktail doesn't cure you then you weren't sick. 

If you're seeking true Mexican cuisine in a super casual restaurant -- and killer-diller Margaritas -- corer  rápidiamente to La Santisima."}
{"text":"All I can say is that sht was pretty dang good! And the Salsa bar is amazing! There is actual spicy salsa options here. Pastor burrito and Guacho tacos were delicious."}
{"text":"Not my favorite. Service was ridiculously slow, couldn't get water (I think every cup in the restaurant was dry), it took over an hour to get a burrito and 3 tacos. The burrito was decent, the shrimp and Al pastor taco are good but not to the point where I would return. The fastest service we received was when we asked for our check."}
{"text":"This place seems to be going downhill. The rice recipe seems to be only good with one cook.... Cross your fingers. 

We ordered the guacamole and it was watery and had a few chunks of avocado... It wasn't \"made\". 

The service is ALWAYS SUPERIOR. Love the front staff. 

Please get good again!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Started with the guac which was probably the best I have ever had. The party I was with had a combination of tacos, burritos and sandwiches ... All which were winners. Too bad I love so far away it this would be a go to place."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic - amazing tacos and eclectic decor.  We tried one of the quesos and while delicious, found it to have a bit too much pastry to it.  The flavors were all excellent though, and the salsa bar had a number of excellent options.  Next time we're gonna try a burrito."}
{"text":"This place has really really really (did I say enough really)good Mexican food. The only negative I have for this place is their location. 16 different kinds of salsa`s kinda makes it up for it though. 
They have strawberry salsa, pecan salsa and the list keeps on going. 
I tried their mole chicken tacos, they are hands down one of the best I have had. If you are big foodie like me and follow Dinner Drives and Dives this place was featured there. The food will not disappoint you here. 

Must try this joint."}
{"text":"On my way home from the baseball game I decided to stop in here and see what all the excitement was about.  I drove past it and then turned around and got a parking spot right by the door.

I ordered the dogfish shark taco and the cochinita pibil taco combo with rice and beans.  I received some chips as I left the order counter and stopped at the salsa bar to get some pico de gallo.  When I got to my table I scooped some pico onto my tortilla chip and wow, what great fresh taste!

I also had some tomatillo, jicama and chipotle salsas that I tried on my tacos.  The shark taco was good and the cochinita pibil was even better.  Even the small cups of rice and beans where really good.

I grabbed a menu on my way out and am already trying to plan what I'll have on my next visit.  I especially can't wait to try the horchata."}
{"text":"The quesadilla was huge and unlike any other quesadilla out there.  Big margs with tons of different varieties.  Gonna go back and try the tacos.  Great staff and cool atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Delicious! :-)
There are so many salsas to try.  Each one is so good.  The street tacos are great.  I tried 3 flavors but found the chicken mole...now, that's my favorite if all.
Great prices.  Service very good.  
I can't say enough except..go check it out.:-)"}
{"text":"I read all the great reviews on here and in the 'Phoenix's 23 of the Valleys best new places to chow down' and was excited - both my sister and I love street tacos.
Maybe I missed something, but I have never been more dissappointed in my culinary adventures. The chips were alright...the array of salsas was impressive and all the ones I sampled were quite good. We ordered 5 different tacos a la carte - Cabo Shrimp Taco, Sonoran Carne Asada Taco, Aztec Tinga Taco, Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, La Condesa Shrimp taco. 
The Cabo was tasty, but nothing to write home about, the carne asada was tasteless and overdone, the Aztec Tinga was not bad... but very one note and we were over it after the first bite. The Condesa Shrimp taco had  WAAAY too much garlic and the shrimp had zero flavor - I came across at least 10 full slices and I still have the taste of garlic in my mouth hours later. 
Overall it wasn't horrible - it just wasn't good - definately not 25 dollars worth -  this is not a place I would return to nor would I recommend it to anyone else
If you want good street tacos see my reviews."}
{"text":"I was very enthusiastic to finally eat at this place because of all the good reviews, but was disappointed.
First of all the place was filthy, tables were dirty, food on the floor, I felt bad because there was only one server but based on appearances i would not recommend this place. 
The food was ok nothing special I was expecting better. I ordered a quesadilla, it looked delicious don't get me wrong but it had no flavor. Mom ordered chicken tacos and was quiet upset that they served her food on a broken plate. If your looking for authentic Mexican food then this place is not for you."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday for brunch around 11am and were seated in the front room which is kind of dark. I saw the main room on the way to the bathroom & asked to be moved because it's so much brighter & nicer in there. Not sure why we weren't set there to begin with considering it wasn't super busy at the time.

La Santisima's main room is decorated with Dia De Los Muertos inspired artwork -- pretty cool! There's also a salsa bar that has a great variety of sauces! I tried them all & my favorite was a smokey, spicy salsa roja; it was hot but not over-powering & still had fresh acidity which I love.

Their taco trios have a lot of different protein options - I chose their Mayan Cochinita Pibil, Sonoran Carne Asada, & Aztec Tinga. So unique & delicious in their own ways but my favorite was definitely the Tinga. 

Chilaquiles in roja & verde salsas with scrambled eggs were so tasty with generous portions.  My dining companion said it reminded him of his grandmother's chilaquiles which seems a pretty strong endorsement! Next time, I'd probably opt for an over-medium egg to add some yummy yolkiness.

Overall -- a great experience with tasty, authentic food, & lots of variety! Definitely would recommend :)"}
{"text":"Fresh chips and salsa with a temporary unidentified object in my \"margarita tamarindo\".  Our waitress graciously explained that this was a tamarindo in my drink, which gave the margarita flavor. I have been driving past this restaurant for years, admiring the beautiful sugar skull mosaic glistening in the Phoenix sun as I drove by.  Well tonight was the night. I pulled into one of the limited parking spaces located directly on 16th street, momentarily pondering how I will pull out later, but consumed with curiosity as to what was behind the big wooden door. I apprehensively opened the door, and was pleasantly surprised with what I found. A quaint mom and pop restaurant with a true southwest feel and experience. With the likes of a visit from Guy Ferari (?) And Best of New Times awards plastered on the menu, I was feeling pretty proud of my mystery choice.  My sister and I ordered and split the bean and Oaxaan cheese burro, mole chicken taco, an the al pastor tacos.  All were excelente!!
Ok, thats enough for now as I am feeling the nice mellow effects of my magnefico tamarindo slowly wear off.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is for the new Glendale location- we've never been to the one across town. I'm definitely a fan of this place, and we'll be back for sure. This place fills the niche for good Mexcian food that isn't heavy and greasy. It was empty when we walked in but there was a steady trickle of people in and out. The waiter was extremely friendly. He explained portions of the menu to us, chatted a bit, and the service was prompt and polite. 
The salsa bar wasn't all that I'd hoped for but it was interesting. Lots of different salsas but many of them were spicy and I didn't really love any of them. Hubby did though so that might just have been my issue. The food, on the other hand, was delicious. Hubby had mole and it tasted like mole is supposed to taste. Like chili and chocolate and all sorts of yumminiess rolled together. I had an Arabic burrito which was much more delicious than it sounds. They happily made it without onions for me and it was awesome. 
Oh, and order the horchata. Trust me. They make it in house and if horchata tasted like this all the time I'd drink it way more often.
Parking is in the back and there is a surprising amount of space considering they're on the edge of downtown Glendale. I also appreciate that the parking area is VERY well lit."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. This place has the best tacos that I've ever had in my whole entire life, ever (seriously, they're THAT good). I also love that they have a variety of self-serve salsas, so you can try as many as you'd like. The place isn't huge, so it can get get packed pretty easily. It doesn't look like much outside, but that's okay because all of the magic happens inside. You should definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican joint in the Valley! I'm working my way down the menu, but at this point my favorite tacos are the cochinita pibil (so very, very flavorful), the Oaxacan black mole, and the gaucho (or whatever they call it --- it's the steak taco with the Argentine flavors). The salsa bar, with about 12 selections, is mind blowing. I especially love the pecan salsa --- never had it before coming here but now can't get enough of it."}
{"text":"We drove from Mesa & it didn't take too long on a Sunday afternoon. It was our first time so we parked right off of 16th Ave. but I would not recommend it because backing out is dangerous due to limited visibility.

Atmosphere:
There were paintings on every wall. Most of them are themed after Dia de los Muertos--the Day of the Dead which is the restaurant's theme. There was a small bar with about 4 bar stools. I would say maximum seating capacity is about 35 because & that is packing every table full & there is barely any room to scoot your chair out to walk around. The muzak reminded me of Jamaican music but my husband said it sounded \"chips & salsa\" music to him. lol

Food:
My daughters are picky & do not enjoy spicy food. Both of the enjoyed the burrito, the orig. quesadilla & the rice. The cheese was unique & flavorful. I am 42 & don't remember ever having eaten it before. Here is a bit about it (Oaxaca cheese  is a white, semi-hard cheese from Mexico, similar to unaged Monterey Jack, but with a mozzarella-like string cheese texture. It is named after the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, where it was first made) y husband said the 3 street tacos he ordered were DELISIOCO. In other words, if it had been served on a plate that was sitting on the floor he still would have eaten them. We also enjoyed the Mexican Coke & strawberry soda while my husband had a Corona with lime. For dessert we shared a slice of Tres Leche Cake (4 ways) which was topped with a bit of whipped cream, drizzled with caramel sauce & pieces of pecan. 

Overall:
The food was very good but I felt bad for them & the customers who left because there was nowhere to sit. I suggest they do what they can to buy out the business adjacent to them & knock out the wall to expand at their current address or, better yet (unless they have other parking I don't know about) relocate to a building with more parking & tables."}
{"text":"So glad we finally got to try this place! The salsa bar is awesome and our tacos were so good.  The veggie taco had so much flavor.  The service was also very good. Two very nice attentive servers! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We ordered pick up the other night from la santisima. We arrived and it was just being put together so we had margaritas which used to be great... they have since started using brand x margarita mix where they  used to squeeze fresh citrus.  The real problem with this place is the inconsistency I asked for them to make sure the order is proper because I do drive 50 minutes round trip to get get there food which I believe is some of the best in the area. I got home and opened the order and it was incorrect we ordered 8 tacos a quesadilla and. The correct items where the quesadillas 2 tacos and the guacamole. I called immediately upon  opening the wrong food and they asked me to bring it back I let them know that's not a possibility and I informed them what was wrong and asked if they could just credit my Amex. They said no and that there manager would call me to review the issue. Well they haven't so hopefully this review will garner attention so I can speak to them about there awful customer service and inconsistency. After being a valued customer for 6 years including the location at 16th street I will no longer come here and I will stop telling people to go here. It's unfortunate but it's the truth this place went straight into the gutter."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon here last year and finally got around to trying the place. My son and I are pretty picky eaters, so we kind of created our own. I ordered a chicken and bean burrito enchilada style, with rice and beans on the side. I don't know what the heck was in that burrito, but pretty sure the meat was not chicken. I had a stomach ache before even walking out....I honestly should have asked for a different item. I don't know what was wrong with the meat. The portion itself was huge. Very large plate. The salsa bar I liked, lots of different options, Inside was cute. Warning though, parking is a hot mess, its literally on 16th st. Good luck getting out of there during traffic. Waiter was nice, but slow. Over all I was disappointed. I will say, the beer battered fish taco sounded good. May go back to try that, but other than that based on what I ate, we wont be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Salsas are excellent the beans could use a little something but other than that it's great!  Must try if you love tacos!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Loved the inner city vibe. This place couldn't have been any better. Gourmet at very reasonable prices. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"So my sister and I decided to try this place out, due to YELP reviews, and man are we happy we did. It was sooo good. 

Loved the salsa bar (the pecan, surprisingly, was my favorite) and we both got different versions of their quesadillas. She got the pork pastor and I got the chicken mole. Both were outstanding and different than anything else we've had. 

They hand make their own corn tortillas, fill them with cheese and your filling of choice, and then deep fry them. This gave them a crisp outer shell but a light and almost creamy masa interior. So good!  

FYI - the neighborhood seemed a little questionable (lots of bars on the Windows) but we went during the day and felt perfectly safe. The place was bumping with other happy diners and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband's choice. He loved it.  I, on the other hand, thought it was just ok. For a taco shop, it's a bit overpriced.  I think our total meal came out $40-$50 and we didn't have any alcoholic beverages.  I've had better in Phoenix for the prices (Barrio Cafe) and would rather visit a real taco shop and eat for $10 than go back.  That being said, the staff is very nice and the food was good.  Their salsa bar is very enticing."}
{"text":"Best quesadilla I've ever had, I wish I could get it back home. It had that really fresh Mexican style cheese, between a very war and flaky tortilla.

You can never go wrong with a salsa bar, particularly one that has a creamy almond salsa, yeah."}
{"text":"Tacos are so good!  Laid back atmosphere and good service. Was looking for some good tacos and it definitely did the job! Highly recommend coming here for some solid tacos!"}
{"text":"I brought my Mom to eat here since I heard their Quesadillas were the best and different. To my surprise the food is made where I'm from, Guadalajara. We had a great experience. The Male server attended us the whole time. Sometimes when it's good server they tend to overdo it a bit but not him. He was perfect amount of attention and courtesy. Quesadilla was a bit crispy more than I like it but my experience overall was the best. I definitely will be back with more customers! Thank you Santísima Team!"}
{"text":"La Santisima is a gourmet taco restaurant located about 3 miles away from downtown Phoenix and was featured in Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Drives (http://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/la-santisima-gourmet-tacos-0246581). In fact, I noticed the signed Diners, Drive-Ins, and Drives memorabilia hanging near the front entrance of the restaurant. There is actually another La Santisima location at Glendale, AZ and one of my friends mistakenly drove to the Glendale location due to miscommunication. Our waiter was someone who just started the job a day ago and he said a lot of people ordered guacamole - I took his advice and it was definitely a great recommendation.

Menu: I have tried plenty of street tacos in Los Angeles, but oh boy the La Santisima's menu completely overwhelmed me. There are just so many regional tacos (Yucatán, Oaxaca, Ensenada, Mexico City, Sonora, Baja Sur, Guadalajara City, etc) to choose from! In addition to tacos, the menu also includes lonches (pretty much like torta), burritos, quesadillas, and botanas / sopas / caldos / ensalada.

Salsa Bar: 14 different options such as pecan salsa, peanut salsa, cilantro salsa, Cabo salsa, Mexicans salsa, pico de gallo, etc. Each table gets a basket of complimentary chips and extra chip will cost $2.70. HOWEVER, you will also get another basket of complimentary chips if you do order a side of guacamole.

***

[Mix & Match Plates (3 tacos with rice & beans) for $13.98 (extra charge if you choose any tacos from the La Santisima Gran Reserva Tacos) - all tacos had two layers of corn tortilla]

[Taco 1] La Santisima Specialty (toasted Oaxaca cheese, mushrooms, poblano pepper, onion, spinach, fresh garlic grilled with olive oil, special salsa cilantro served with your selection of meat - steak; extra $0.99 for plate): Excellent and flavorful steak with crazy toppings - this was the best one out of the three I tried. (4.75/5)

[Taco 2] Mayan Cochinita Pibil (12-hour slow cooked roasted pork shoulder until fork tender marinated with Achiote Mayan rojo, Mexican herbs, wrapped in a banana leave topped with pickle onions; extra $0.51 for plate): It was one of the Yelp recommendations, but I thought this pork shoulder taco tasted just okay. This was my least favorite taco out of the three. (3.5/5)

[Taco 3] Baja Sur Baby Shark (Corn tortilla filled with beer battered wild baby shark cazon, cabbage, salsa cilantro & mayo; extra $0.51 for plate): Well seasoned and tender fish taco. I liked La Santisima Specialty just a little bit more, but I will not shy away from ordering this taco. (4.5/5)

[Rice & Beans]: Rice tasted slightly sweet and bean had a slight spicy kick. Both were very good. (5/5)

Guacamole (aguacate, cilantro, chile serrano, onion, tomato, mango, jicama, cranberries; half for $6.99): It also came with a basket of complimentary chips. One of the slightly sweeter guacamole that I have tried and I really like it. (5/5)

Horchata (Family recipe fruits and pecans; $4.50): Talk about a huge bottle! A very unique horchata with strawberry and a hint of cinnamon. It was a very solid horchata and just slightly sweet for my taste. (4.25/5)

***

Recommendations: Don't eat too much chips and get hook on salsa bar or guacamole because you will not have enough room to finish your tacos. Tacos aren't exactly cheap here, but this is really the taco shop for foodies in general."}
{"text":"Very good. But packed during lunch. Messy tables are unsightly, and the wait is long.
The food is awesome, though my order wasn't entirely correct, I ordered shrimp mole taco's and received chicken. Though was charged for shrimp (I think).

Service is friendly, and being such a small place I think they try very hard to deal with the lunch rush, but seem slightly understaffed.

I will go back as they have a great and varied menu and an awesome salsa bar. I just would probably wait until a non-peak time."}
{"text":"Only reason i cant give them 0 stars b/c its not an option.Never stopping here ever again....stopped on a Sat 1/21/17 asked for table of 8, I get it its a small place and tables are scarce but was told 20min wait....waited 1.5hrs for nothing. Multiple parties of 4 went ahead of us. When I asked why the wait was taking so long and having multiple 4 people parties go ahead when  their tables could have been combined to accommodate us, the waitress gave me attitude and back peddled b/c she couldn't come up with a reason why others were being seated before us. If they weren't going to accommodate us just communicate and we could have gone elsewhere without wasting 1.5hrs of time. Can't rate the food b/c we were never given any service."}
{"text":"Drive by here all the time, based on mostly good Yelp reviews, decided to check it out.

First, their parking situation is pathetic.

Second, the service is pretty horrendous. The server was actually nice and was doing her best, but she had no help and was running the entire restaurant by herself. Seating, serving, busing all done by one overworked server. We waited 45 minutes just to get our drinks. About an hour to get out food.

Third, food is not bad, but not worth the wait.

The horchata and the salsa bar are the only saving graces to this place, but honestly it should be shut down."}
{"text":"Someone suggested this place to us and were warned that their customer service was slow, but goodness we weren't expecting THAT slow for a restaurant. My boyfriend asked for a local beer from tap and called it by the brewery name instead of the beer name and that apparently confused them even though it was the only Huss beer they had up there (never has that happen to us before at other places since every beer tap has the brewery name). The thing I hated most was that they don't split the bill by the individual if asked. Only way to split it is by splitting it in half, which sucks if the other person orders more than you. Luckily, we basically ordered the same thing so half worked for us. The tacos were yummy so that made up for everything else, however they weren't yummy enough for us to want to deal with that again."}
{"text":"I used to come here when most people wouldn't venture this far down 16th. Now you can expect an hour wait on the weekend. It is well written it, though.  I rec the Gandhi taco on corn tortilla, with addition of fried oaxaca cheese. Obviously not vegan anymore, but yum!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem down the street from my work. The salsa bar is ON POINT! So delish! And the Ghandi burrito (ironically with chicken added) is very fresh and so yummy. I definitely recommend going here. The service is sometimes slow at the high times, so try to avoid that if possible. They have doubled their business side, which has definitely helped. 
Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Whhat? I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. It is by far, one of my favorite taco shops in all of Phoenix. Authentic. Quality. Delicious. 

When you first come in you get chips and can start experiencing the amazing salsa bar. Each flavor isn't just thrown together, but put together with thought and care. I have favorites, but they are all pretty tasty.

Follow that up with some amazing food (I personally love the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco plate with double rice). Then you can wash it down with a, not-so-traditional, but in a good way Horchata. 

They will then drop the bill off and you will be pleasantly surprised that you had such an delicious, fresh meal for such a reasonable price."}
{"text":"My first time here and I am still waiting on 4 tacos, 35 minutes later. These tacos better be worth it!!!! Great horchata."}
{"text":"so my mom is in town and wanted some good mexican food.  i ran through the list of places that i know in my head and have frequented.  i stumbled across La Condesa and suggested it.  but i wasn't sure, i mean, i wanted to take my mom somewhere nice and i wasn't sure about La Condesa's atmosphere or food.

after much deliberation we decided on going.  and boy oh boy, we were not disappointed in the least!

to begin with, i'm a big fan of dia de los muertos imagery.  so to walk up and see a big mosaic sculpture above the door, i was already biased that this place may be my new favorite mexican food spot.  inside was decorated much the same with beautiful paintings of dia de los muertos portraits.  stunningly beautiful (i wish i had asked if they were for sale, but they had just finished up a remodel, so i was assuming they were not available).

their salsa bar is amazing!!!  my personal favorite was the jicama salsa.  but i could seriously sit and just eat chips and salsa.  

i had a big sur dogfish shark taco and a carne asada burro.  the calabasitas (mini-squash, kinda like zucchini) were amazing!

the service was great too!  she was very friendly and was willing to chat up with us...always nice when i'm trying a new place.

this will definitely be my new joint for tacos and burros, hands down!"}
{"text":"One of the best burritos I have ever had! I ordered the Santisima burrito with shrimp and after waiting impatiently for it to cool down enough to eat it, I was amazed at the complex flavor explosion...I had a cute waitress who was made sure I had everything and checked back often. The salsa bar is THE BEST I have ever encountered, I tried 4, which was about 1/4 of them, and was blown away by the Pecan Salsa, WOW....I wanted to try a marg but went with a beer, gives me a reason to come back....Very cool interior and a decent variety of beers and Tequilas..."}
{"text":"Seriously outstanding tacos.  Not sure why we waited so long to come here.  Will be bringing everyone that comes to visit us in Phoenix here! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place has classic tacos from Mexico D.F. and a really great salsa bar. The peanut salsa is unexpectedly spicy, and the cilantro salsa is a personal favorite of mine. 

I'm a fairly unadventurous eater. Once I find my favorite, I like to stick to it, but that's pretty much impossible here. I want to try everything, and think that over time, I'll eventually get there. Until then, my top recommendations are the street plate with at least 1 mole taco. You'll be upcharged, but if that's your only reason for not trying this piece of delicious, message me for a stronger sales pitch. The point of this place is that if you know what you like, or even if you don't, you'll find something here. Everything tastes like a really good version of what you'd expect at a price point that can't be beat.

Pro tip: toss some cilantro salsa in with your rice :)"}
{"text":"The menu is kind of big and many items may be unfamiliar to many.  They have a baby shark taco and numerous other items that sound unique and exotic.  Even the horchata is quite large and they sprinkle all sorts of toppings to it.  The salsa bar also contained items I usually don't see in other taco shops.  The green salsa was spicy and delicious.  I was surprised at my bill being over $21 (3 tacos + beans/rice + horchata).  Regardless of how fancy a taco is the price shouldn't be so high per person.  It's a freakin' taco.  Also I wouldn't recommend parking  on the main road facing the restaurant.  Some are signed for another business in which after I opened my car door someone popped out and sternly let me know they will be calling the tow on inappropriate parked cars.  Also these spots when you back out is super dangerous as cars on the main road are racing by pretty fast.  There is a parking lot on the side of the restaurant that is much safer."}
{"text":"Great food. Had the Gaucho Taco which was good. However the breakfast I had with Spanish sausage was really really good. The Chipotle salsa was one of the best salsas I ever had. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A great little taco spot hidden in Phoenix. The pastor tacos have a nice hit of spice, which contrasts well with the sweetness of the pineapple. Prices are reasonable. This place is seriously small, we went on a Tuesday afternoon and it was empty, though I can see La Santisima filling up quickly during the evening. Our waitress was reserved, but not rude.

It's not in the best neighborhood, which is kind of sad, because there's an elementary school across the street, but I feel like the best eateries are usually in someplace sketchy. Often, you must venture outside your comfort zone to experience the sublime.

Also, I neglected to try the salsa bar, I was so memorized by the pastor tacos. I'll definitely return on my next trip to PHX."}
{"text":"Great food, however cramped seating, and service that could use some improvement. I love the salsa bar, but quite a few of the salsas were empty, and not being filled up. Definitely enjoyed what I ordered! I look forward to eating here again, while hoping for an improvement in the service."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this place was on Diners, Drive- Ins and dives until we got there and saw a huge picture of Guy Fieri. Trust me when I say you need to go here if you visit Phoenix. There is a salsa bar that you can go to to get any sorts of salsa they have made for the day. They were delicious! The food was absolutely fantastic. I ordered a pork burrito that was so good every bite, and there was a lot of food. I couldn't finish it, and I can eat a lot! My husband and friend both really enjoyed their entrees, too (shrimp Jamaican burrito and a roasted cauliflower burrito). It wasn't until after I ordered that I decided to ask the server what their most popular dish was, and I wish I would have ordered what she described to me! Our server was really friendly, too. I'd be in trouble if I loved in Phoenix because I probably frequent this place more than I should."}
{"text":"The absolute best Mexican food! Everything is made fresh to order and delicious! The mole is unforgettable! The drinks are top notch too."}
{"text":"Very pleasant surprise!! Food is outstanding, great portion sizes and service was great, will definitely eat here again!!"}
{"text":"I always bring friends and family here to have good real Mexican tacos. They always  want to come back here. The horchata tastes the way my mom and grandma make it."}
{"text":"Every time we visit Phoenix we take an Uber straight to La Santisima from the airport! Our favorite Mexican restaurant ever and they have an amazing salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Some the best taco I've had. I had the Al Pastor (pork), Carne Asada & Chicken mole. The service was friendly and a salsa bar was amazing with 13 different salsas."}
{"text":"Hands down best tacos! They have quesadillas and burritos as well (I think they added sandwiches recently but I don't know for sure). Anyhow, the quesadillas are fried, so if you shy away from fried food, don't even go there. The salsa bar is the best I've ever seen and I enjoy mostly all of what they have available. I like the arracherra taco, the tinga taco and the guacho taco. Perhaps I have spelled those incorrectly, I'm not sure but whatever you get it's going to be good. I do not however, like the beans. I don't know what it is or why, I just don't like them. I do like the rice with the corn in it but generally speaking I just get the tacos a la carte. OH and the Horchata? OMG, get it I promise you even if you don't like Horchata you will probably like this. It is huge though and has fruit and nuts and wow, it's just good. I like the Jamaica (sp?) juice too, but who doesn't :-P... Obviously, I don't speak spanish sorry for my awful spelling. Everyone should try it here, but they are small and get busy so try to find a time not everyone will be going to eat."}
{"text":"Love the salsa bar!! Kind of a tight squeeze but worth it."}
{"text":"Mexican food that's as good as everyone makes it out to be. The tiger shrimp tacos are the best I've had and I'd highly recommend them. Salsa tasting is also a fun and unique experience, though you quickly realize that there's really only 1 or 2 that you really enjoy. Be ready for a wait cuz this place is poppin'"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour after work (5:00pm) on a Friday night and my party (of 2) was able to be seated right away.  I really liked some of the artwork hanging in the restaurant.  We ordered several types of tacos and loved them all.  Even more impressive was the well stocked salsa bar ranging from cheese causes and mild salsas to some that really make your mouth burn.  I had a great time here and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best Taco place in the valley. Great selection of salsas and hands down best Horchata in the world! Small and not the best seating but who cares! Carnitas are  tops."}
{"text":"If you're Mexican do not come here. It smells. We had the hostess tell us multiple times are server was coming then she would end up helping us. The waters are not natural. The meat was probably microwaved or re-heated. Did I say it smells? The complimentary waters are faucet water.

Update: this the next day. I had to leave work early today. I have the stomach flu. My little cousin was crying yesterday his stomach was killing him and he had never felt such pain."}
{"text":"Ok. This place was great. But I had some issues with my girlfriend here. She's an executive chef and is madly in love with Guy Fieri. When she saw the autographed poster she instinctively tried to climb on the table and smell it. I think she even tried to lick it. After the manager had to threaten to call the cops she settled down and after the shakes and sweats stopped, we were able to enjoy the best damn tacos we have had in a loooong time. The salsa bar kicks ass and we mixed a few together to get even better sauces. I do recommend this place to everyone, but not Guy Fieri. He's a dick and almost ruined our vacation."}
{"text":"I was realllllly craving horchata and was phyched to be in the area, so I did a quick run in to go order at lunch time on a week day.  I was impressed with how they handled the crowd, they had a flow.  I also ordered some al pastor tacos, while waiting I filled some to go cup from their salsa bar, then waited at the bar. They gave me water and were very friendly even while busy as can be.  When I left and dug in to my al pastor I was sooooo impressed.  It was tied with the best I have ever had.  So amazing! Street tacos are the way to go!  I won't wait so long to come back next time!"}
{"text":"A quaint lil' taco shoppe, with an assortment of DEEE-LISH salsas, my favie is Peanut Salsa and Orange Salsa.... and a menu paralleling Al Varado Street, Downtown LA... and HORCHATA to make your eyelashes curl! 

LEmmmmmE just say.... it's YUMM-4-DAYS......"}
{"text":"This is the greatest Mexican restaurant I've ever been to.  The salsa bar offers more choices than I've ever seen.  The meat was perfect.  Even the rice was filled with flavor--which was a real surprise since I don't remember ever having rice I could actually taste.  And the margarita was much better than anything I can remember.

Outstanding food at reasonable prices  in a non-pretentious atmosphere.  What more could someobody want?  I'll certainly come here again the  next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent.  You could never get tired of the large variety of salsas--that seem to change every time I come in.  The menu is overwhelming and the food is top notch.  They also have excellent margaritas that are really inexpensive during happy hour.  The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Okay, so I literally live a few blocks away from this place. There are so many Mexican options in the area, but I knew this was one we had to try. 

First of all, the place is tiny inside. We had a 15 minute wait on a Sunday afternoon which was a little annoying, but also proved that they aren't lacking in business. The worst part is that there is literally no where to stand. So we kind of tucked our bodies into a corner and tried to stay out of the way. That was kind of awkward. I was surprised that this was a sit-down restaurant. I was really expecting an order-at-the-counter type of place. In fact, I still think that would've probably worked better. 

Once we got our table, we were brought a complimentary basket of chips and a tall bottle of water to fill our own cups with. I like that the chips are free (especially since they have all the delicious salsa options), but I was disappointed that you get charged for chips after the first basket. We ordered the guacamole to go with all the salsas and were pleasantly surprised. My husband makes guac at our house all the time and I'm a bit partial to his, so I was excited to try such a refreshing, different take on guacamole. Pretty tasty! 

For our main course, I ordered the veggie quesadilla and my man ordered the bean and cheese burrito. Both were delicious! I have to admit that I wasn't a fan of the fact that the quesadillas are fried, but the amazing cheese made up for it. I was worried that I wouldn't have enough cheese with all the veggies they stuffed inside, but I was so very wrong. I seriously could not get enough of that cheese! I am craving more right now...

I guess one of the downsides to this little place is the fact that it is so packed inside. We literally were just a few inches away from the table next to us (and the guy nextdoor was so annoying!). They also only had two servers scurrying between all the tables so the service was not the greatest. We had to wait awhile for drink refills and the check which was a little disappointing. The food does come out quickly though so if you're hungry, you wont be kept waiting. 

So yes, I was quite pleased with our first visit to La Condesa. We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend who would not stop raving about how amazing this place was. It had so many great reviews, so I was pretty pumped to try it. They have a rather large menu, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how many vegetarian options they offered. They have a nice, fresh salsa bar, however many of them contain ingredients that are smoked, which I do not care for, but they were still rather delicious. The strawberry, peanut and rabano (radish) salsas were surprising and tasty.  I ended up ordering the Azteca tinga lonche and a Pacific white fish taco. The taco was good, but the breading was a little soggy, and came with way too much mayo. The fish flavor overpowered pretty much everything, even when I drowned it in salsa. The first bite of the lonche reminded me heavily of manwich...something I have not eaten since I was a small child. The flavor was too tomato-y, much like manwich, and was tough for me to finish. The birote it came in, however, was delicious and crunchy. It pains me to give a low rating, when other diners are dishing out 4 and 5 stars. I would be willing to give this place a second chance, but good bread and salsa is not enough to entice me back just yet."}
{"text":"This place easily gets a 5 star for amazing authentic Mexican food - some of the best I've had.  We had a group of 5 and all ordered different dishes - all were extremely flavorful and well prepared - difficult to choose the one we all liked best.  The service was barely a 3.  People were nice but we didn't see our water much and took long to get a drink, the check, etc"}
{"text":"This place flipped a 180 on me! I am a regular and I sometimes I used to ask myself why. The food is great but the service is guaranteed to suck. However me N the girl were hungry so we decided to eat some huge burros. On the way we joked about bringing a book while we wait. But this time we were seated right away,  bright drinks and our order came out in record time all thanks to JUAN our server. I felt like I was on that show Bar Rescue and they cleaned how and got service as good as their food. It was a nice change to not have moody, disrespectful waitress girls that they usually have. I hope it stays like this or perhaps Juan can give lessons."}
{"text":"Great but overpriced, maybe for a good reason. I'd say some of the best taco's in Glendale, but they are kinda stingy with salsa to go. Paid $100 for 7 and the kid only offered us 4 salsa's to go. If I wanted more, I had to pay extra. At least 2-3 per person, jeeze (Trust me, they are tiny) Would have given you guys 5 stars if you weren't so stingy. 

Also, bring back the strawberry spicy salsa, why remove your best?"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Mexican food while in the Phoenix area- so we decided to head on over to this place.
It's located in a crusty part of town...just FYI. We went in on a Thurs night and the extremely small restaurant was packed.
There really is nowhere to stand if you're waiting for a table. The place is so tightly packed that you kind of awkwardly stand with your butt in a diners face while waiting for someone to seat you.
There were only TWO people working the entire floor that night. From seating, to serving, to bartending. TWO PEOPLE.
It was an extremely long, awkward wait and we kind of ended up seating ourselves at the bar once it cleared out because no one else offered us a seat anywhere.
I felt bad for anyone who came in after us because they all had the same look of awkward confusion on their faces as they stood by the door for 20 minutes waiting for SOMEONE to let them know what to do, where to go....
We got margaritas, which weren't very strong- and we're extremely expensive ($8 ea???). And even though the service was the worst I've ever seen in my LIFE- the food completely made up for it. I wanted to hate the place, but my burrito was so good- I never wanted it to end. I got the La Santisima Specialties Burro with arrachera  . Heaven on a PLATE. So flavorful, filling, delicious....i'm like...daydreaming of it now.......
The final bill was pretty pricey for only 2 burritos and 2 drinks- $50?? If I were to visit this location again (which I will)- I'd most likely just get my food to go. The inattentive lack of service makes you feel more like a bother than an appreciated customer.

*edit* Moved to Phoenix, been here twice since then. Food is still super amazing. I mean seriously...that La Santisima Specialties burro dipped in pecan \"salsa\".......to die for. Service hasn't changed. If it's busy, goooood luck. Your service will be horrendous. We went today and it was FINALLY slower...we actually got a table and not the bar stools for once. And we were served a lot faster...much more pleasant. Wish they'd expand.
But whatever. Awesome place, just go."}
{"text":"I love this place. The Pecan Salsa alone is enough to keep me coming back. The Horchata is divine and the brunch offerings are filling and hearty. We shared a Traditional (Cheese) Queso which was filled to the brim with Oaxaca cheese. It was not one of those flat Quesos you find at most places. It looked more like a turnover with it's flaky tortilla dough. We each had a burro and should have split one as they were enough for a meal by themselves. We noticed their Happy Hour Street Taco deal right after ordering so that will have to wait for another visit. Pecan Salsa oh how I love you."}
{"text":"First timer and heard great reviews about this spot so it was only fitting to bring my nephew vision from NY. For starters the Paloma drinks were probably the best I have had from any location, the freshness of the fruits mixed with the tequila was tasty! Now the salsa bar was a surprise but a good one with the vast selection of salsas ! The pork burrito was phenomenal, must say the flavor can't describe but the picture I post can speak for itself ! I will be back very soon to try out the tacos !"}
{"text":"The food is as authentic as it gets. The specialty tacos were amazing. The salsa bar was out of this world. Loved the peanut salsa"}
{"text":"Had to wait 40 minutes for a table despite there being half a dozen open tables. Never got a water refill or offer for a second drink. The waiter literally took our order, dropped off food, and then brought us a check. Nothing else. 

Food was good, but service was so bad I'll never be back."}
{"text":"I have to say the drinks here are very good, service is great but the food was fair. I got a Torta but the meat was very chewy and didn't put much meat in my Torta. It had a lot of cueros. It's very expensive here just for 2 Michelada it was total of $18 it was one of the best I've had but other than that, I couldn't enjoy my food."}
{"text":"So, mi media naranja and I were flying out of Phoenix early in the morning: we were headed to Boston for a couple of weeks. I didn't want to get up at the butt-crack of dawn to drive up to PHX from Tucson, so we decided to stay the night close to the airport. Of course the normal \"what do you want for dinner\" conversation started, and we decided we wanted some good Mexican food before we left the desert Southwest. Yelp led us here; when was the last time you saw a 4 1/2 star review with 500-some odd reviews?

Those 4 1/2 stars weren't lying. The salsa bar is ridiculously fantastic! Strawberry salsa? Yes please! I had four helpings of the robano pibil salsa. Chips were sorta warm, nothing incredible; the real star was the salsa. I ordered a couple of al pastor tacos and a Mayan Cochinita pibil. The pastor was delicious, and the Mayan taco?? The pork was mouthwateringly tender and perfectly seasoned. I felt sad when my plate was empty. 

My better half had the cabo shrimp taco, which she didn't seem super excited about. The mole taco, however, got her talking; incredibly, she shared a bite with me. I agreed; it was phenomenal. 

Service was fast and courteous. I'd take off 1/2 star for using the restrooms as a storage area for extra dining-room chairs. Kinda gross. Overall, though, it was excellent and I am glad we went!"}
{"text":"Jim W was in town and that was all the reason needed to party, well at least have dinner.  Heather C and Ryan C also were able to show up.  This was my first visit here.  I arrived last and there were chips, guacamole (thanks Ryan) and several salsas already on the table.  About half way through the second basket of chips we placed our orders.  Most of the table got tacos and I got the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa.  I also ordered the Horchata which was very tasty with the addition of nuts and fruit but when done left a pile of stuff in the bottom.  The Quesa was delicious, quite filling and actually made two meals for me.  Just a note: mole does not do any better in a microwave on high than gravy, but it still tasted fine.  Service was fine and she split the checks after she had already given us a single one.  We were dining fairly early but as the evening wore on it got pretty busy on a Thursday even with a major Haboob going on.  Definitely a place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now for lunch.  I had been to the other location previously known as La Condesa once so I knew the food was going to be good.  And it certainly is.  Parking seems like it could be a hassle at times.  Another Yelper says they park at the school when it is not in session.  This time I noticed the back gate was open with an empty lot on the other side of the alley but my server could not tell me if it was ok to park there.  The salsa bar is always a delight and I try to limit myself to two per meal so I can keep track of what I am having.  Service both times has been OK but sort of an afterthought.  I will certainly keep this place in the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Food was good as always but it took an hour to get. It was kinda busy but they have no flow. If any of the owners/ managers are reading this..contact me if you need another server/ manager to help sort out this mess. Im a closer at a restaurant right now and would be willing to help you guys out. This happens every time we are there. It's painful to watch, your servers are running around like chickens with their heads cut off whenever more than 5 tables are there."}
{"text":"Nothing more than average at best. Other than the Awesome and extensive salsa bar , it was pretty mediocre..especially for the 4 1/2 stars they have. 

We had two burritos and they were decent! You could taste the individual ingredients and the vegetables tasted fresh, which I liked but it wasn't a BURRITO. It was more like a wrap you would get from Whole Foods. Not to mention, it was way, way, way too small. It was similar in size to a McDonalds snack wrap. I legitimately left lunch at La Santisima and had to get a bite at another place...Mexican joints are supposed to fill you up!

Either way, the place has a lot of potential and it could be very good but I wasn't a fan.

If you've ever been to Lucha Libre in San Diego, it's very similar in style, just not as good in my opinion."}
{"text":"I could have only eaten chips and all the salsas from the salsa bar and I would have been a happy camper. I wish I could have packed the salsa bar home with me, but unfortunately, it doesn't work like that. (TSA has a limit in liquid ratios). 

I tried almost every salsa from the bar and I have to say, the best one is actually a combination. Mix the guacamole and peanut salsas together, and you instantly have salsa crack. I could have eaten tubs of the mixture and still wouldn't be sick if it. The heat of the guacamole salsa balances quite well with the umami of the peanut salsa.

Street tacos were good too but my mind was on the richness of the salsas. They should just change their name to Salsa Heaven. 

Other than the salsas, please note the service was subpar and the prices on the menus and what they actually bill you is inconsistent, but only by a few cents so no point in arguing."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place even though it received good reviews from a local news source. The staff was not very friendly and the food was ok.  The price was steep compared to other local mexican food restaurants.  I had to eat the chips with no salsa since they were out."}
{"text":"An airport shuttle driver recommended this restaurant, as it was fairly close to the Thunderbird School of Global Management, where I was headed for the week.  Though, in reality, it feels like nothing is close to anything in Phoenix.  She said that she sends people there regularly, and she gets good feedback from those she sends.

One of the things I loved about it: it's not just another Tex-Mex restaurant pretending to represent the cuisine of this vast country called Mexico.  Their menu features dishes from all around Mexico and unless you can't break your non-adventurous self from burritos, then you'll probably experience something new and delicious.  

By the way, our party of four did not experience any of the others' comments about poor service.  The young woman who served us was prompt, cheerful, courteous, attentive, and was happy to take a group photo of us using my phone. She was even rather easy on the eyes for us four men.  I'd recommend the place."}
{"text":"I'm sure you have heard my stories how I have had to drag my son to try some places in the valley, well my son had been very annoying telling me I need to go with him to La Santisima, he just loves that's close to his house. 

It was 9:30am on a Saturday and I was in the mood for breakfast and told him ok let's go! He had already warned me that it was a small place with a long a wait but that they were worth wait. We walked in and saw we were the only ones theirs, YES! No wait for us!

I was in the mood for a breakfast burrito, but after checking out there breakfast menu I went the Chilaquiles Rojos with Chicken, toasted tortilla with salsa roja, chicken, cheese topped off with over easy eggs & with black beans severed with bread & avocado.  Oh my gawd, this was an excellent breakfast! It was a lot of food, I couldn't finish it all, it was flavorful, and it was the perfect amount of sauce to tortilla, so good!

I am glad my son talked me into trying them out, now I have to go back for some Tacos!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about this great little restaurant.  Honestly.

I always eat out when the general public isn't out in force, and I love going to La Condesa in the middle of the afternoon on weekdays.  Many good restaurants have the afternoon restaurant \"limbo\" period where they close until dinner, but it's great that this place doesn't.  

Every single thing I've tried there is so good I wind up benchmarking most other Mexican-style restaurants against La Condesa.  Starting with their tortilla chips and salsa, the chips are always super fresh, and their salsa bar is the best I've ever seen; all home/hand-made gourmet salsas, TWELVE in all, obviously all made fresh.  Each one by itself is incredibly great, while I have about 5 favorites I always focus on.  

I got addicted to their mole sauce.  That's surprising for me because I'm not a big chocolate fan at all, and the first time I saw mole sauce, just the idea sickened me!  Plus the first time I tried it, the person who made it really didn't know what they were doing -- but that all did a serious about-face once I tried La Condesa's.  It's hard to not order their mole chicken, but if you want to try another truly interesting and great gourmet taco, burro, or bowl, try their Pork al Pastor, it'll blow you away too.  I recently tried it burro style, and with some fresh tortilla chips and a half dozen cups of various salsas, it was almost too much to eat -- I chose to just have ice water with the meal, and the whole tab came to about $9-bucks.  Even when you just want water they bring you a glass filled with ice and lime wedges, and a stopper-type liter sized bottle of ice cold water.  

Service is always fantastic too.  There isn't a whole lot of room in the place, maybe 15 tables and bar seating as well, which is why I also like going there when the crowds aren't around.  They're open for breakfast on Saturday's and Sunday's, I haven't been there during those times but I'd bet my bottom dollar they make a killer Huevos Rancheros!  

This is certainly a must visit restaurant if you haven't eaten there before -- I almost don't want to write such a great review because they do enough business as it is, and I don't want to ruin one of my favorite places to go!  I'm picky, but not unrealistically so -- it's not often I'll write a 1-star review, and the same goes for 5-stars.  This place is absolutely a solid FIVE STAR restaurant, hands down IMHO."}
{"text":"MUST go! So glad I found this place on Yelp, otherwise I would've never spotted it just driving by. The La Santisma veggie tacos are amazing! I tried the veggie tacos with the cactus too- also good but I preferred the others. Service was friendly and the food came out fast. Check out the salsa bar for a plethora of yummy salsa options. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ok, I finally got a chance to come back with some coworkers. They changed their format. The first time I was there, it was go to the counter order and they give you a number. They have waiter service this time. I got the Sonora Arrachera Quesa (Oaxaca cheese & char-broiled Arrachera steak). It was so good and too much for me to finish. I looks at my fellow lunchers and their tacos looked so GOOD. The salsa bar is filled with all sorts of varieties. I tried the strawberry salsa, too sweet for my taste... but more to favors to try!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and the salsa bar. Everything I have tried here so far has been great. The mole is very tastey and I have to say you must try the quesadillas they are awsome (but mind you they are not for those watching the waistline)."}
{"text":"The salsa bar here is the best! I really liked the food. The tacos are small but filling. Many dishes come with a side of beans and rice and they are delicious! Had a quesadilla before...not quite like Mexico city but it had good flavor just thicker but a huge portion. Service has always been fast and friendly so no complaints there."}
{"text":"A total hole in the wall, but so good!  Tons of different salsas to choose from."}
{"text":"I was so hyped on my way here, I brought a coworker to order for the whole store. It was so busy, everything looked great. I said I've never been here and I'm starving. He ordered for me and it literally ended up being a beef burrito with only retried beans and nothing else. I'm sure everyone else enjoyed there's but man was that confusing"}
{"text":"We have been to many Mexican places (around the nation) & found this one on yelp.. it's very authentic (not Americanized), it has the right amount of heat. Loved the salsa bar, their tacos (loved the Jamica shrimp one but Mahi fish & Mexic Mignon were ok). Beans & rice had good flavor. My husband really liked his burrito...I was a little skeptical about getting their tramarind margarita but was one of the best margaritas I've ever tasted. Waitress & their service were equally good. Definitely going back here and trying other things on the menu."}
{"text":"After coming to this location for a very long time I decided to treat my parents since they had never tried it. Unfortunately their first experience and now our last was a very disappointing one. The food was great as usual but the waitress lacked any customer service skills. We never even got her name because she never introduced herself. But she was the only server at noon on 1/26/17. She Never once acknowledged us when she took our order. It was very uncomfortable as it felt like we were a bother. If you're looking for a great experience this place is not it. Not anymore. It seemed the table next to us was also upset and placed a complaint but she disregarded it and even joked about it the her next table. So I figured it was pointless to complain instead id rather save the bad experience for others."}
{"text":"Excellent service, servers were very kind. food was average. I will probably be back to try the lonches."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is killer!  They have a great salsa bar but be careful my friends - don't fill up on the chips. Save room for the gourmet tacos!  For about $15 you can select 3 gourmet tacos + rice and beans. They have authentic tacos and several interesting vegetarian options. The taco plate will fill you up for sure - lots of food (and very yummy)."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Tacos are amazing and salsa bar is creative and diverse (the cashew salsa is truly delicious and there are a number of options to choose from). The gaucho taco is a solid staple with charcoal grilled steak, sliced avocado and pickled onions, and the arrachera taco has subtle complexities of flavor despite its somewhat simplistic presentation. There are also an abundance of other delicious/unique menu options (such as the deep fried Quesadilla for example), and the wait staff is very helpful and kind as well. Would definitely recommend this place to family and friends in search of a local one of a kind hole in the wall Mexican restaurant. Definitely a must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"What else can I really say about this place? 
1. Their service is good
2. Food is great, super fresh & has various varieties. 
3. The Salsa Bar is to die for! 
4. They give warm chips right when u sit on the table 
5. Small & very intimate 

It also made me feel better that this place had a lot of credentials on their wall from being the best of Phoenix to one of the neighborhood gems!"}
{"text":"Very good Al Pastor Burro. It's a little hard to find right away from the road and parking can be a hassle but this is such a great place! Their salsa bar has flavors I've never even thought of that go way beyond green, mild, medium and hot. The meat in my Al Pastor Burro was so juicy and flavorful and the pineapple was actually in there for once! Will absolutely go back with friends next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Now we're talking.  Fabulous tacos -- the Chicken Tinga is amazing, as is the Cochinita Pibil.  The salsa bar is amazing; lots of choices, some of them specialized for your taco/burrito.  Reasonably priced hole-in-the-wall.  Service is just o.k. and it gets hot in the summer (no/weak A.C.), but the food and the value are excellent."}
{"text":"Wow. Not a huge fan of beans but theirs are so good would make a meal of beans alone. This place is a must go."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp last year during our vacation and had to come back. The food is delicious. Street tacos and burritos are a must try. And the salsa bar, so many options if you like spicy try the one with nopales (cactus). The classic margarita is so refreshing, my kids love the horchata."}
{"text":"This place was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives .... What a great  Taco and the spin on the Orchata with pecan nuts and cinnamon. .. great flavor!"}
{"text":"Guac has dried cranberries! Salsa bar superfun. 

Drove across town to return. The corn quesadillas are phenomenal. HUGE! Mine came with shrimp and poblano peppers. 

Art on the wall very engaging. Seems like each had a story to tell. 

Service very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Phoenix. Their Jamaica Rose Shrimp burrito is A-MAZ-ING! Prices are reasonable, lunch rush hour can get a bit crazy but there's always room to sit and their food never lets you down."}
{"text":"Wait was over 30 min for 2 people. Numerous tables were open but waited to sit people. Food was not good and not worth the money. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner tonight and this place is amazing. Grass fed beef carne asada, amazing drinks (Margaritas) and delicious tacos. I would recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Street taco were excellent. The rice and beans that came with the tacos were very good. Tastes very authentic. The shark tacos were also very good. They also have a fantastic salsa bar. It's a small place but you can usually get a seat with a short wait."}
{"text":"This place deserves the hype. I asked the waitress to surprise me with with a couple tacos. I was impressed by the three she ordered for me, but the special shark taco was unreal. It was the best taco I have ever had the pleasure to consume. This is a wonderfully unique eatery. I would highly suggest dining here."}
{"text":"Great service- server was friendly and attentive. Small place, will probably have to wait if you could at a typical busy lunch or dinner time. Food was on point, even a few options for vegetarians! Good sized portions, not overly pricey. Love having the salsa bar there!! The jicama drink was similar to a berry juice, was a little too sweet for my liking but once it was watered down a little, it was delicious. Will definitely come back here next time!"}
{"text":"Kool small joint, reminds me of the Mission District in my old San Fran hood.  Authentic street food. Cheap prices, strong salty Patron Margaritas. Insane horchata in 
a huge glass ?40 oz???   Ridiculous slow service on Saturday nights.  Chips not salted but thats ok because of the kick ass salsa collection."}
{"text":"Food - OK. Had cochinita pibil tacos with beans and rice. I found bone and thhe flavor wasn't all that great. Husband had a quesadilla - way too greasy. Napkins couldn't soak up the grease fast enough. Salsas available, because some were empty were quite tasty.
Ambient- sound bounced of the walls and couldn't really have a talk with out contributing to the already loud room. Lighting not great. Beautiful mexican culture inspired art. Loved it.
Service- not good. Sat us down and then disappeared had to stop them and ask any of the employees to put in our order, refills, and our check. The worst part was... there wasn't that many people.
Other- loved there terra cota plates. Cups were paper cups, and they had nice silver wear. Couldn't figure out whether it was nice dinner restaurant or just a dive."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  They raised their prices by A LOT, and also the lady made me sit down, when before you just ordered at the counter. Always loved how this was a cheaper spot where you didn't need to tip. NOT ANYMORE!  I've been a loyal customer for years but now im going to my other go to taco place if prices don't change back to what they used to be!"}
{"text":"We go here at least every few weeks. Very Authentic.  The prices are pretty average. I do wish that they had some bigger bowl of salsa as they give you these small little tester cups to try their salsa bar out with. You also have to pay for your second bowl of chips which isn't exactly ideal. This place is usually very very busy. I believe they had a bench to sit outside and wait. The staff doesn't seem to have any sort of order or manager there to help them out. You definitely will sit at your table for at least 15 minutes before minutes before being asked what you want to drink and then get your drinks probably 15 minutes after that.  The staff may ask you if you would like to order your meal enchilada  style but just a heads up- it costs an additional five dollars or more to make this happen. I think they should let people know that as they are ordering or add that price on the menu.  Overall we love this place because the food is so good but we do think they could make a few changes to benefit their business and customers.
Update: Ate here again as we do every few weeks, the service is TERRIBLE but the food is delicious. The place was not very busy but again, the service was the worst service you've probably ever experienced. Not a place to go if you are in a rush, with guests or if you are trying to accommodate etc. we sat at the table ready to go with drinks empty for a solid 20 minutes at least. They need to hire a manager and get this staff up to speed on acceptable service."}
{"text":"I love this place!  We have been several times and it never disappoints.  Great food and the salsa bar is fantastic.  It can get pretty busy so sometimes you have to wait for a table but they are always moving fast and it is always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Luchadores, sugar skulls, and amazingly flavorful spicy cuisine of Mexico. What more can you ask for. Be fore warned however, the salsa bar is full of spices salsas. This is not for the weak of heart!"}
{"text":"La Santisima is on the top of my list for tacos in AZ.  It's not in the best part of town and the parking situation is a little tough if it's busy, but the food is out of this world!  My hubby and I came once, and decided to bring my parents here for an early Mother's Day lunch.  

I go weak in the knees for restaurants with salsa bars, but this place has a salsa bar on steroids.  They cater to all tastes and all heat levels.  I am in love with at least 5 of their salsas, including the pico de gallo that is so lime-y and delicious that it's the first one that ran out during both of our lunch visits.  

My hubby ordered the Norteno burrito both times and I got a variety of street tacos.  The carne asada is soft and juicy and not the least bit tough like you'll find at most Mexican places.  The beans remind me of the ones that my BFF's mom makes in Nogales.  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Went to La Condesa this past week, WOW!!!  Loved it!  Great atmosphere, cool hole in the wall type feel with excellent food and outstanding service.  Between a family of 4, we had street tacos, quesadilla , and the pork burrito with some great seasoning ( can't remember the name of it).  All of it was super tasty.  Don't forget to try all the salsas, each one of them offer a great addition to the food provided.  Finally I leave with this.... My kids asked if the restaurant had churros, so I asked and they mentioned they recently took them off the menu.  Waiter very nicely apologized and said sorry we don't have them anymore.  2 mins later the guy came back as we were signing our bill and told me he could make them for us.  They had the ingredients.  Within 5 mins my two kids had not only churros, but churros with strawberries, chocolate, Carmel and pecans on the plate.  Well presented and very delicious!! To top it all off I asked them to provide me a new bill for the dessert and he said its on the house.  There not on the menu, no need to charge u.  :) :).  Please don't use this against;).  What a fantastic experience!!  10 stars!!"}
{"text":"Great great great food!! Best guac we have had in a while. Nice and chunky. Had cranberries in it, which I would have though would take away from the taste, but actually made it so much better!! Street tacos are delicious and their salsa bar is amazing. Great food!!!!! Definitely a memorable place."}
{"text":"Amazing salsa bar! Loved the cilantro variant... 
Excellent tacos, great prices... A gem hidden in Phoenix."}
{"text":"te encontre! 
I've been reading yelp reviews of this for a good two weeks and was dying to go here.

After a long day of not eating, I forced myself to go here. It's completely out of my way but boy was it worth it.

I ordered two things:
Carne asada tacos combo plate and a Tinga quesadilla.

The fact that they have tinga makes me very happy. It wasn't as \"tingaish\" as I would have liked it, but then again, no one has ever made me tinga like my Tia guty. 

The bad:
- teeny tiny parking. I came here at 4pm on a friday and was the only person there for a good ten minutes. I can't imagine finding a parking spot when there are more people around.

- The tortillas weren't great. They're not bad, but they aren't anything special. A taco should have a good tortilla in case the meat sucks (not that it sucked here).
- The rice and beans portion is small. WAY small. I get that a restaurant needs to make some profit, but these are tiny. 

The good-

- The quesadilla is huge. By huge, I mean I ate half of it and had to save some for later because of how filling the doughy tortilla is. This is not your average quesadilla. Not only do they use the right cheese (not your Americanized mozzarella and monterey jack or even, god forbid, chihuahua cheese), but the tortilla is flaky AND flavorful. That's a quality tortilla. This tortilla is nothing like the one used for the tacos, you can tell they make these themselves.

-The variety of salsas is pretty damn good. They will have everything from the most unoffensively bland salsa for gueros to a chile de arbol salsa that could make my daddy sweat. 

- La horchata. Now this is what horchata should taste like. Other restaurants take note because people may come here solely for this. The fruit is a cute side trick, but the horchata really is good.

I give it five stars because it reeks of unpretentiousness and we all know how much I loathe pretentiousness. The artwork is simple but quirkily Mexican, there is nothing fancy about the decor (which I like) and the cook looks like my Tio Memo (except he can cook whereas my Tio cannot). 

Overall, I hope they don't change a damn thing here. Let it become as popular as they can but please, please, don't change what you have! Finally, some authentic (and I hate using that word) tacos in Phoenix."}
{"text":"An excellent experience with great food and service. Without a doubt the best tacos I've ever had. The tacos are thick and filling. Don't forget to pick up salsa at the salsa bar.

All the tacos are loaded. I worked out before and was full with 4 tacos. I tried:

La Santisima Special taco: again loaded with cheese, and steak. A juicy satisfying mess. Would come back for this.

Mariachi loco taco: crispy, toasted shell with tasty barbacoa and onion filling. My second favourite after the La Santisima Special.

Cabo Tiger Shrimp taco. Loaded with juicy battered shrimp. A really good combination with the cilantro and cabbage

Anda Lucia taco: This was my least favourite but it's because I'm not a huge fan of beans. But the chorizo and potato are juicy delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been here quite a few times now.

I love this place because it stands out among the hordes of Mexican food places serving smothered in cheese and sauce Mexican food. That's not my Mexican food at all. La Santisima is. 

The location is across 59th. Ave from Old Town Glendale so not exactly walkable from Old Town because who wants to cross Grand and risk death by car. There's a small parking lot in the back of the restaurant though. 

It's never very busy when I've been for a weekend lunch or dinner. La Perla next door can be packed with patrons and 20 tables will be empty at La Santisima some weekends. That simply means less hassle to get some of the best food you can find in Glendale.

I would recommend trying anything with arrachera in the description and the al pastor tacos. Their seafood choices are bangin' too. 

Their salsa bar will challenge your ideas of what a salsa can be made of. 

If you want to go for lunch or dinner at La Santisima and you can't find a date, I'll go with you anytime."}
{"text":"I use to go there and the food and salsa bar was excellent! I don't know what happened! They either sold the place or got different cooks or changed their recipes on their sauces, but things have really changed for the worse! I am really disappointed! It use to be the best place in town! I  am really sad! I see they are opening other places! If they don't get better they will lose business!"}
{"text":"How can I possibly start this review? I'll just say it. This is my new favorite Mexican food restaurant!!!! Really really. It's THAT GOOD. I've been eating Mexican cuisine since I was a baby-so I like to think I know the good stuff when I taste it. This place it \"IT\" for me. I'm so happy with my experience, because I had really high expectations. 
I could go on and on about La Santisima, but I'll just cover the highlights so my review isn't painfully long. 

*Horchata-amazing (I like that it was served to me in a to-go cup because it's so large)  
*Tacos-unique and exceptional in every way (Lots of meat!  Insane flavors.) 
*Salsa bar-most impressive I have ever seen 
*Menu-large and intriguing (I want to come back to try just about everything listed)
*Atmosphere-great artwork  
*Service-stellar 

This place is so good that I was telling my waitress I can't wait to come back, and I hadn't even finished eating. L-O-V-E this restaurant. Wow. Wow. Wow."}
{"text":"There is no question this place has the BEST Mexican food in the valley. My problem is with the way it is ran, I have been a patron here since before it was on tv, before anybody heard of it, before it was popular. I have raved on yelp  how delicious the breakfast is here. It is only served on weekends and it is to die for. The past three times I have come for the desayundos, the waiters told me that I missed brunch hours. The first time, I did get there pretty late, around 230 so I understood. She said 2 was The cut off. The next time I got there, it was 1, and ironically, they weren't serving breakfast, I had just missed it. Now this time, I came at noon, and there was no more breakfast. What a Shame, I haven't had my favorite breakfast in almost a year. And it seems every time I get ther, is when they stop serving it. Also, the salsa is picked over before noon. They make a wonderful salsa seven chiles that I could eat as a main course, but it is always out when I get there. Ever since it has become popular it seems the customer service is poor, and the rules keep changing. The food is wonderful, everything else is horrible."}
{"text":"Great variety to choose from. Salsa bar with plenty of options.  Queso fundido could of been melted more, it was like it had been sitting for a minute and was a little difficult to eat, got it with pablano chili's and it was flavorful. Home made tortillas were the best! Loved the tacos! We'll be back."}
{"text":"No Bueno! Rude waitress, cold and bland food. If it was busy I could understand..... it wasn't busy...I will never go back. A high priced pseudo Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"The Cabo shrimp tacos were amazing.  The shrimp is fried in beer batter.  It was crisp and delicious.  They have a Salsa bar of over 15 different homemade salsas to choose from. The pico de gallo was my favorite. Everything was fresh and well prepared.  There isn't a lot of room inside, so call ahead if you have a big group."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Great salsa options and it's nice to have good tasting vegetarian options. The staff was friendly and the overall vibe is great."}
{"text":"SOOOO thrilled to find this place! The food is excellent - not the heavy cheese-laden Sonoran style that the Phoenix market is used to, but a lighter, more flavorful Mexican style. Lots of things to choose from on the menu. Loved my chicken mole burro. Margs were delicious and I cannot wait to do happy hour there - an afternoon of $3 margaritas and the amazing salsa bar with a great variety of salsas. I particularly liked the pecan, peanut, and chile arbol salsas, although they were all really, really good. If you love horchata, you'll love the one here."}
{"text":"Tasty tacos, great decor, pretty mediocre service.

Setting: I was pretty excited to try out this place, because I'm a fool for good tacos. This place definitely stands out in its neighborhood--the facade does a great job of making it do so. The inside has a great-looking bar area, the artwork is really nice (I dig the Dia de los Muertos theme), and the furniture is nice and colorful. It's a cozy little place, with tables very close to each other to fit in as many as possible in a relatively small area.

Food: The food is pretty excellent. I ended up trying 4 different tacos during my visit, and they were all very good. I tried the Mayan Cochinita Pibil, La Condesa Veggie Taco, the whitefish taco, and the Gaucho taco. I was most excited about the cochinita pibil, because it's one of my favorite dishes, but I ended up being most impressed by the gaucho taco. The steak in it was very well done, and the flavors went well with each other. I could have used some more chimichurri, but it was tasty nonetheless. The cochinita pibil was very good as well. The whitefish taco was a little bland. I wouldn't have minded some stronger flavors in it. And the veggie taco was quite good--right up there with the cochinita pibil. The rice and beans, though not the star of the show, were really good! I liked that the rice was a little \"stickier\" than most rice you find outside of more Asian-type restaurants. And the beans had great flavor.

When I first opened the menu, I was very conflicted over what to order. There are so many great options! I'll definitely have to come back and sample some of the other options. The salsa bar is pretty great. There is a good range of selections, including a few options I had never seen before (e.g., strawberry salsa and pecan salsa).

Service: This was definitely the downside to the experience. Despite there being nobody in front of me waiting for a table when I arrived, it took about 30 minutes of waiting to get a table. Seeing as there is nowhere inside to wait, that's a long wait in the Phoenix summer heat. Once seated, it took a further 15 minutes for anybody to come over and ask for my order. And once I had finished, I sat there for about 30 minutes before I had an opportunity to request our check. Fortunately, I wasn't in any sort of hurry, but that's a lot of waiting.

All in all, I enjoyed the experience and will be back. It's a little pricey for tacos, but the ingredients generally merit a price higher than your typical taco stand."}
{"text":"The salsa bar is worth writing sonnets about. Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco with cilantro salsa might be the only thing I eat for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Great food.  Not your typical Mexican place.  Multiple salsa options on their salsa bar.  Get drinks."}
{"text":"WOWWWWWWWW

Seriously, wow. We took the kids here one night when we were looking for someplace good to eat. We were going to go to America's but we used to live there, so we tried this place out instead. It's right down the road, so we were like \"what the hey.\" Firstly, the outside is so cool looking. With that big ol sugar skull thing. So artsy. I was a little nervous we'd be out of place. But then we thought... \"well, it's not in the nicest area, so it can't be too scenester\" SO glad we made that decision. So we go in with the kids and sit at a table. The seating area is very intimate, I didn't mind that. The decor is really cool, gotta love a place with a great ambiance! The server was really nice, not overly nice. He did a great job. Omg the salsa bar is amazing. We tried them all! The kids loved trying them and naming them. The cilantro salsa.... never had anything like it in my life. 

I had the fish tacos that were such a relief. I have had some bad fish tacos in the past so I was a little nervous. But wow. We also had a margarita. They were both strong so I got to finish my husbands. Yay for me! :) 

I was a little disappointed that there isn't a kid's menu. I think they should make a small taco plate for kids, and maybe an option for a small burrito with a side of beans and rice. But the kids made due just fine. My daughter had a bean and cheese burrito and my son had 2 of the carne tacos. They both loved their choices and my husband swapped a carne taco with one of my Son's fish so they got to try it all. Yum. The chips were also great and made it nice to be able to dive right in to all the salsa options. 

The price might be my favorite thing. All four of us ate, got drinks, and my husband and I had a margarita all for about 40 bucks including a nice tip. You really can't beat that! We will DEFINITELY be going back to La Condesa!"}
{"text":"What a lovely spot for a lunch consisting of Mexican fare of quesa, tacos, salsa bar, strong sangria. Superb flavors and I greatly enjoyed the paintings by Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez. 

I finally had a chance to try horchata garnished with pecans, berries, cinnamon. I couldn't help but think about the tune by Vampire Weekend teehee 
Baja Sur Dogfish Shark taco of corn tortilla stuffed with beer battered dogfish shark - nice and soft.
Maria Sabina Quesadilla of Oaxaca cheese with sauteed wild mushroom melange - crunchy and cheesy yummy! I'm glad my friend took me here while I was visiting!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with our last visit here. Now I can be very honest, they had two large parties but was not jam packed. I was in the restroom at the time of the drink order and my family did not order me anything. When the waitress came, she took my order but never came back with anything. I waited around 20 minutes for someone to come back and I once again placed my order. 
From the time we sat down we knew it would be busy but never expected we would have to wait over am hour for our food to come. Not once did a waitress offer to refill our drinks and when someone did come by to offer more chips, they were given to the wrong table. Okay, we understand that stuff happens and large parties can throw people off but once the food came, we asked for 2 small plates as we were sharing with kids. Once again, the waitress never came back and the kids ended up sharing our plates and eating off of napkins. A more seasoned waitress came, and we expressed our frustration, the most she could offer was an apology and to discount our drinks. 
My husband and I made an observation and the waitress who would leave a table after taking an order would go and clean tables instead of bringing what we asked for. It was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I have only been here once but it won't be the last time. 
The food here is so fresh and the salsa selection; i have never seen anything like it and it's all so fresh and interesting. 
The ambiance has a lot of character but people come here for the food. I just had tacos and was blown away by the flavor. 
The shells were good but the meat was seasoned nice, the veggies were crisp and the staff were awesome. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is truly amazing. I had smoked marlin, mahi mahi, and shrimp tacos. All fantastic. My friends and family all loved their food too and the mole is excellent. I also had a mango margarita with a chili rim that is probably the best margarita I've had in Arizona. Could not recommend this place more. I love Mexican food and Santisimas keeps with tradition while adding their own incredibly tasty flares! Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I had ever had. Of course, this isn't saying much considering East Coast Mexican food has nothing on West Coast. Now I know.

I came here twice. This place was so good,  I dreamed about eating their shark taco that night. And the next and our last day in Phoenix we went back to get more. Nice way to round out our stay in Phoenix. Best meal for last.
 
First Night:
If you don't get the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco, you are missing out. Perfectly crispy beer batter. Amazingly soft and tender fish. Topped with cabbage and some kind of yogurt or mayo sauce. Not sure where else you can get dogfish shark tacos, but I wish all my fish tacos could be shark from now on. Make sure you order the shark taco and not the regular fish one.

If you're not a seafood person, the Mayan Conchita Pork Shoulder is a good taco to get. The pork shoulder was cooked until tender and the sauce was delicious and flavorful. The pickled onions on top is a perfect combo with the pork.

Second Night:

The second time around I had the shark taco again. This time I also tried the Cabo Shrimp Taco. Another amazing taco. The shrimps were large, and I'm not sure what they put in their batter but it was so crispy with a nice tang to it. I also tried some of the Al Pastor Street Tacos. Order this if you want something strong in flavor and charred. The street tacos are also cheaper than the gourmet ones.

Sides:
The Guac was chunky and fresh with tomatoes, cilantro, onions, and I think cranberries. The salsas were all average until I tried the jicama one. It's so fresh with the lime and cilantro. Best salsa I had ever had. Each table gets a free basket of tortilla chips. We got two for our table of four.

I never had horchata before, but it seemed to be the recommended drink to get. I wasn't a big fan of it. Not that it wasn't good, but I'm just not a fan of horchata in general. The pecans, cantaloupe, and strawberries did provide freshness to the drink, but it was too overpowered by cinnamon. The drink is huge at 32 oz.

There is only one guy acting as a server, so service can be a little slow. But these tacos are worth the patience. The restaurant itself is a little bit cramped but there is enough seating. There's also one large table for a big group.

On a side note, I saw a picture of Guy Fieri on a board next to the salsa bar. He seemed to have signed it with the date 12/14. Future Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives joint?"}
{"text":"This little place was recommended by my brother, we went on a Sunday and it was super busy we waited about 20 min to be seated which was not that bad. 
The food was amazing and the salsa bar is kept fresh! Cant wait to go back. I had a quesadilla with mushrooms and an horchata. It's probably one of the best horchata's I've had! Must try this little place in Phoenix you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"For extreme flavor I would recommend this place.. the Salsa is so different prefect place to eat"}
{"text":"Aw, what happen to you La Santisima? You used to be one of my favorite Mexican restaurants but the last few times weren't great and my recent visit made me not want to ever come back. 

I came to dine and service was awful and took forever to get us water. No kidding - it took about 15-20 minutes. I finally placed my order of the shrimp taco, chicken tinga taco and the steak taco. Our food didn't arrive until another half an hour. The restaurant wasn't even busy!! Our food arrives but we weren't given silverware so we sat there looking at our food for another 5-10 min. The shrimp taco was ok, the steak taco dry and I had enough that I didn't want the other taco. 

I'm so disappointed. Oh well, bye La Santisima."}
{"text":"Excellent stop for tacos and salsa's. Food is incredible - however I only gave one star due to price- probably because of the popularity and demand it is not necessarily cheap and there is no kids menu. But it truly excellent food and worth it. It could be inexpensive if you only by
one or two tacos a la carte. I didn't experience too long of a wait on my visit."}
{"text":"Holy Tacos and Salsa Bar!!!!!! This place is the real deal. We came here 10 minutes after opening and we were glad we did. This place filled up quickly and for good reason. The tacos were incredible. The spicy pork, the beef, the white fish all mouth watering. The refried beans and rice served on the side tasted awesome, I just wish the portions were larger. Right away we were served large baskets of warm tortilla chips and we tried every salsa at the bar. Some were very spicy!!!! I enjoyed the cilantro cream one on the fish tacos. The quesadilla came with avocado slices on top and the cheese was very tasty. These tacos were gourmet! I really enjoyed everything we ate here and would definitely come back. Prices are fair as well. They staff kept refilling our glasses of water and kept checking in on us. We had a great lunch here."}
{"text":"Wonderfully different tacos and probably the best beans and rice ever. There were so many things to choose from, but I thought a place that bills itself as 'gourmet tacos' should get a chance to live up to its name--and it did. I chose the 3 taco platter so I could sample different ones. Each was unique and tasty. The barbacoa was probably my favorite. There is very little parking and there was a line inside but it was worth the wait. Baskets of chips and orders were going out of the kitchen every few seconds. We got there a little before noon and I don't know if it was because they were so busy, but every table was cleared and cleaned within minutes, or less, of being vacated. My husband, who spends a lot of time traveling, kept raving about how good his was."}
{"text":"Damn, you want some awesome tacos, burros, quesadillas, or tortas?! This is your place! Ever since Guy Fieri stepped foot in this place, it gets really busy now. It's a small place, so expect a wait unless you go during off times (avoid lunch and dinner). The salsa bar is incredible, so many different variety of salsas from cilantro, pecan, to a delicious jicama or a bomb pico de gallo. The quesadillas aren't your typical ones, they fry them entirely that it almost looks like a empanada/quesadilla hybrid but they're so good! It's true about what they say about the horchata, it's the best I've tasted. They put pecans and chopped fruit in the horchata giving it some extra flavor a but its so delicious. My favorite tacos are the Shark tacos! Try them! Only reason why I give them 4 stars is because the service is alright. Sometimes they are not staffed adequately and it takes forever to get your order in, other than that, it's a great Mexican food joint!"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food. Very friendly service. Couple of things you should know. 1- you don't just sit down and wait for order. You need to go to cashier and place it then it will be brought to you. 2- park on the side of the building, easier to get in and out. 3- make use of the salsa bar. Very good and probably different from what you've had in the past. Food was very good and had great flavor. I did order a drink that took a long time to come out but the manager gave it to me on the house. Can't complain. No big deal and the mint drink was delicious. We enjoyed this restaurant"}
{"text":"Very Disappointed.  We have been patrons since long before the triple D guy showed up. Last night was the last straw. They expanded the dining room without expanding the kitchen or staff. 2 cooks in the kitchen cannot keep up- according to staff they were both \"new\". No soap in bathroom, floors are dirty, chairs are dirty & stained all because they don't have enough staff.
Customers were trying to help make drinks because the 45min wait for our food was just too much. We left and will not be back."}
{"text":"Really amazing food. Salsa bar is impeccable. Wait is atrocious, but \"they are working on it\". 

Overall 9/10, but yelp doesn't let you do 0.5 stars and I like to round down"}
{"text":"The food was incredible. The salsa bar is very impressive.

The wait was exceptionally long even considering it was the lunch rush.

Overall very good experiences."}
{"text":"Their horchata is delicious and has fresh fruit and pecans at the bottom. My husband loves their salsa bar and we both enjoy their quesas. Great vegetarian menu options too!"}
{"text":"While I wouldn't recommend every pretentious hipster foodie come running to Phoenix (not that I would wish that horror on the lovely city of Phoenix- maybe a plague of locusts would be easier to deal with)- there are some great places to eat there. I say \"there\" because I am from NY and I am here now so there is there. Anyway- I loved it here (there) and went twice in my 6 days in Phoenix. Fantastic tacos- shark, smoked marlin, steak, slow-cooked pork, chicken with mole- most at $3.99 some near $5 but all nicely sized and overflowing with ingredients and deliciousness. The horchata was damned fine also. Love the décor, reminds me of Baby Bo's Cantina in NYC except obviously the food at La Santisima is much better."}
{"text":"Monday for lunch and people were waiting out the door. They mentioned 20 min, first time there not from AZ but BF said food is amazing.  We waited 10 min tops sat down.  Place is small but staff is working hard to get everyone in and served.  Right away you just notice how happy the people are to be there.  
I ordered the burrito special with shrimp and a Jamaica agua.  I was starving went I went in but could only finish half of the huge burrito. Partly because do the chips and delicious salsa bar.  Definitely coming back when back in town."}
{"text":"Small place. Great tasty food. Reasonable prices. Will definitely come back for the shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town this place had Great Mexican food. Not an expert on Mexican food but I have been around a lot of places in the USA searching for something good and most places have fallen short. For my taste buds this place is top notch. Thumbs up. I really don't like giving 4 or 5 stars reviews but it's hard to find good Mexican food on the east coast."}
{"text":"We order the steak taco, chicken chipotle and two shark tacos. The chipotle chicken taco was the best thing we ate.  It was saucy with the pickled red onion on top.  Yummm. They have a very unique salsa bar with lots of choices for salsa, some cream based, some vegetable  based. Very cool."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the ambiance was really cool! Service was so-so. We were seated and our order was taken quickly. The server never refilled our drinks, which was especially disappointing after eating spicy salsa."}
{"text":"This place is the best. I'm addicted to their El Pastor burrito. So many flavors and they're all amazing! It gets really busy at lunch so plan ahead or call in your order."}
{"text":"The menu has expanded!  Got there early for  dinner meal.  There are only 10 tables in here so you may have to wait at high times.  We were seated quickly, ordered no the food was out in a flash.  We ordered the Marlin fish taco and and Sonora beef taco plates.  The fish taco was juicy and flavorful; one of the best fish tacos I have had.  hUbby also like his steak taco.  The salsas were low, a tribute to their goodness.  Once they got filled up, we helped ourselves to Jicama, guac, cilantro and tomatillo salsa.  tHe guac salsa has a good kick to it so beware.  We ate all the free chips.  Overall a great food experience in the heart of the Barrio."}
{"text":"I get to Phoenix a few times a year and I come straight from the airport to get the El Gaucho Quesadilla -- Argentine beef is so tender and flavorful and the crunch of the quesadilla is perfection. YUM!"}
{"text":"So good!  Had a burro,  ate half took home the rest.  I'm now eating the other half for breakfast and have been brought back to a euphoric verde sauce heaven!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant ever. The food is crazy yummy. Like out of this world yummy. I want to yell out in pure joy every time I take my first bite. This place is almost 40 minutes from my home but my boyfriend and I have already gone back four times (really!) They also offer vegan and vegetarian options which is hard to come by at Mexican restaurants. They recently expanded the restaurant and it is now a bit more casual but the food is just as good as it was before. I really like looking at all the interesting art work, too. I just love this little place so much. Don't forget to try the horchata, made with fresh strawberries and pecans. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food and sauces!  I never have experienced such diverse foods. They have pulled recipes from all over Mexico and excel at reproducing some amazing food. If you love Mexican food you must go here. Their salsa bar is like no other. Pecan salsa, peanut sauce etc. And they have a good tequila selection!"}
{"text":"Best fish taco I've had so far. On that scale I give it a well deserved 5 stars. I also had the pork and chicken street tacos, I would probably only order the fish taco next time. 
Authentic. Great choice of house made salsas."}
{"text":"This is mine and my daddy's place! We love the food, and the salsa bar is great. It's a small place and it's always busy. We love to come here every Sunday night."}
{"text":"I was in town from Texas. We know Mexican food and I can say this place is amazing!!! 

The salsa and chips are great! Good service!!! 

I had the smoked Marlin quesadilla!! First it tastes amazing!! Not like any I have had before! Great flavor profiles and the guacamole on top was second to none! 


I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Looking for a great variety and exceptionally fresh Mexican food, this is the place. Also has an excellent array of vegan and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"To sum up- the place was great. 
Food was tasty and served promptly. Our waitress made great suggestions, which can be necessary as the menu is huge and it can be overwhelming. 
We went with tacos- one street and one gourmet. They didn't disappoint. 
I do have to say that there are other places with more \"street like food\" that I prefer. However, this was still pretty good."}
{"text":"This place looks pretty rough from the outside, and is easy to miss. On the inside; however, it's quite comfortable and nice. I'm a fan of Horchata in general, but I have to say La Condesa has the best I've ever had. Also, they managed to change my opinion about Mole with their Mole Chicken taco. 

The salsa bar has no equal! Cilantro Salsa, Jicama Salsa, Peanut Salsa, the list goes on an on. You can experience what seems like enless and amazing combinations of flavors.

I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but no the best I've tried, the best feature in this restaurant is their salsa bar. I was disappointed they don't carry enchiladas...really, a Mexican place selling as \"authentic\" doesn't carry enchiladas? Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good, although the prices could be a little bit lower."}
{"text":"Had really fantastic tacos at lunch today. The Cochinita Pibil was note perfect, and the Marlin brought me back to Mazatlan. Salsa bar is tremendous as well, my favorites were the strawberry, the pecan, and the chipotle. Get there early for Lunch!"}
{"text":"Best burrito I've had in a long long time. At least two of the salsas are worth the price of admission alone and the horchata is world class with fresh fruit."}
{"text":"First off, the service was lacking. Our waitress didn't seem very attentive or happy towards us. She could have checked on us every once in a while...and maybe smile? 

HOWEVER, the food was delicious (which is why I had to give a least four stars). We ordered their carne asada tacos and they didn't disappoint. Their salsa bar has a lot of choices and yes, the horchata is good."}
{"text":"Great tacos and the salsa bar is a must try! Would not recommend for groups larger than 2-3 as the dining room is tiny. It feels a lot like all your aunts, uncles, and cousins jammed into grandmas kitchen."}
{"text":"I would say taco shop is a misnomer. It is a small restaurant/ bar. Very interesting food, not typical \"Taco shop\" fare by any means.

Ive been there a few times now, their quesadillas are more like calzones, very tasty!
Portion size is good.Their chocolate cake is a must order.

They have a strange salsa bar, a lot of \"novelty\" salsa. Interesting for sure.

The paper and plastic baskets instaed of plates is one thing, but, too nice inside for use of the cheapest plastic flatware ever made, (not even the decent ones) Please buy bulk stainless @ Costco. That plastic is useless, hard to eat with.

I would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Holy Hell is this place fantastic!! Have already been back after the initial visit. I'm still in the process of forgiving the bf for not introducing me to this place before. I mean - seriously - we've been together over a year and he's just now taking me here. I'm still mad (jk).

Haven't done any plates - just a la carte tacos! Because. TACOS!  YUM! And the horchata was outta this world! My goal is to make my way through the taco choices! So far - each one is delicious! And the salsa bar - fantastic!! About 13 different types...peanut, strawberry, pecan, tomatilla, roasted, etc... 

The place is small. The staff hard working, friendly & diligent. XTRA tipping highly recommended as they are busting butt."}
{"text":"Great Asada tacos and a great selection of Mexican beers. They even have Mexican coke in 500ml bottles! Small restaurant but worth the trip!"}
{"text":"What else is there to say about La Condesa that hasn't been said in the hundred other 5 star reviews of this place?  Not much, so I'll just add the following for extra emphasis...

1. The tacos.  Oh the tacos...  even living out in California, the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark tacos are made of dreams and sunshine and sugar plum fairies.  If sugar plum fairies came in the shape of delicious, beer batter fried dogfish shark pieces.  With just a little cream sauce and lettuce so you don't miss out on any of the shark.  And the Cochinita Pibil tacos... there's fall off the bone tender, then there's meat that's pretty much as  close to melting as meat can get.  But these are just my favorites... I've tried all the tacos on the menu, and they're all delicious.

2. The salsa bar.  If I can give this place any criticism, it's that they run out of salsas far too often.  Late in the day.  Just before they close.  Look... sometimes I'm in a peanut salsa mood, sometimes I'm in a chipotle salsa mood, sometimes I'm in a strawberry salsa mood.  I can't help it.

3. The horchata.  Just order it.  It's big.  Bring guests.  Share it.

I come here far too often for someone that lives 1000 miles away.  Love it."}
{"text":"I've lived in Phoenix for 19 years and this place is hands down one of the best burrito/taco places around. The Al Pastor here is to die for. Full of flavor and cooked to perfection, you will never be disappointed that you tried it! The chicken tinga is also delicious. The huge salsa bar is very unique and a fun way to spend your time by trying out the different salsas before your food arrives."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp.  Visiting AZ for Spring Training.   You have got to try this place.   Absolutely delicious!  Great food, tons of choices and yummy house margaritas.  Loved the salsa bar. 

I ordered the street tacos.  3 different flavors with beans and rice.  I had the tinga, el pastor and chicken.  Super delicious.  Rice and beans perfect with the tacos.   We had a couple of the house margaritas during happy hour and they were sweet but tart.  Food arrived quickly.   Wish I lived here so I could try everything on the menu. 

Beautiful art on the walls and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"La Santisima is a great option for legit Mexican in Phoenix. The food itself is 5 stars; the only thing preventing a perfect 5/5 was the service. The waitresses were very friendly and by no means provided poor service, but definitely left some to be desired with only a 2-3 total pit stops to the table. In all fairness, it's a bit \"divey,\" so it's part of the experience. 

This originally caught our eye as it was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, as well as great reviews. The selling point and highlight of our visit was the salsa bar. I consider myself a salsa pro (I refuse to buy jarred salsa, I'll only make my own), so it was fun to sample 15+ varieties. Pro tip: only the first basket of chips is free. Additional baskets are $2.40/each. 

Our tacos and burro were great themselves, but did need some pizazz from the salsa bar, perhaps by design? After we doctored them up a bit, we wiped our plates clean. The tortillas were especially delicious. Value was also great. With water to drink, our total after tax was less than $20. Overall, I would recommend La Santisima!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for lunch this afternoon after reading the \"Eating 16th Street\" blog in the New Times :http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2012/08/la_condessa.php#more

We went for a late Friday afternoon lunch and though the place is on the small side had no problem finding a seat. The decor is great, and the food truly was delicious. I tried three different \"street tacos\" and they were all wonderful - particularly the Al Carbon. My husband had the Azteca Tinga Burro and he also said it was very tasty. We also indulged in some \"we earned it\" margaritas and they came complete with grapefruit, lime, orange and lemon slices. I've never had it that way before and it was delicious. We will definitely be going back for more soon!"}
{"text":"We went here to give it a try as I love Mexican food. I am all for the whole-in-the wall Mexican food it's the best you can get. I will have to say this place left much to be desired. I'm always reluctant to give negative reviews but I have to be honest so that we spent our money in the right places. I liked in on a positive note so I will  start with what went wrong. As soon as we entered we were confused as to whether to wait by the door or see ourselves. Turns out we were able to see ourselves but upon sitting I noticed a lot of the chairs were stained so I felt a little uncomfortable. I managed to find a somewhat decent chair and my husband and I ordered tacos which is normally our first go to at a place where unfamiliar with. I like that they had so many different sauce the choices that was really great. We ordered cups of water with lemon which came in cheap throwaway plastic cups. When the tacos came our plates looked cracked like they were ready to be retired. I had three tacos And out the 3 I ordered I only liked one...same for my husband. We were pretty much done at that point. I thought it would be hard to mess up street tacos but apparently not. On a good note the salsa and chips were good and the waitress was kind."}
{"text":"I had an extremely hard time deciding whether to rate this restaurant three or four stars. It is a solid 3.5 stars, but I decided to raise it due to the free salsa bar and authentic food.

The restaurant is a small location with an all-you can eat salsa bar with various flavours such as cilantro salsa, peanut salsa, tomatillo salsa, and strawberry salsa just to name a few from the selection. The meal also came with a free bowl of tortilla chips, but extra bowls cost more. The tortilla chips were a little thin for me, but definitely tasted authentic.

I ordered the taco plate with two different tacos. When ordering it was a bit difficult to understand what the waiter was saying, but contrary to the menu, he said that you can have two different tacos on the menu instead of one type on the taco plate for $8.99. In the end I paid more than the $8.99 for my taco plate in the end.

I got to taste three different tacos and a part of a burrito after sharing with some other people eating with me. My wild white fish taco was extremely crunchy, but disappointing due to the fish ultimately being too big for the corn wraps. The traditional Mexican taco was very spicy, and the meat was fairly flavourful. The best taco was the pork shoulder taco which was moist and tasted great. I also tried all of the tacos with the spicy guacamole provided at the salsa bar for an added kick. The pork burrito used a flour tortilla and was relatively bland aside from the pineapple salsa which was a refreshing sweet flavour.

Overall it was a nice portion, but was a little expensive. The food is definitely authentic and provided a delicious taco."}
{"text":"Great place, great Flavours - 7 chili, cilantro and strawberry salsa are must try.  In my first visit, I tried chicken tinga and a burro, the meat was well cooked and juicy. 

Place was small, but nice ambience. 

The neighborhood was litle shady but  the quality of food defeats all those negative factors. 

Definitely recommended.

Ps - the place is open late till 11pm, even though yelp hours shows 9pm."}
{"text":"Breakfast was amazing! The salsa bar is the best in town! Friendly staff. Would strongly recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"The food was good but they didn't have any steak or cochinita pibil. The Jamaica did not taste natural. The service by the waitress was very disrespectful and did not deserve a tip at 18% which was included in the check."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service is okay, well worth giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Really good street tacos. Good service and affordable beer. Amazing pecan salsa - yes pecan, I'm not joking, go try it."}
{"text":"Food was great! The fish and the shrimp tacos might be the best in Phoenix. The salsa bar is just as good and has some great traditional options - just like mom's house! The drinks were generic but generous and well priced. I give them 3 stars because of the service, or lack there of. Every time I go in there, whether it is 6 or 9 pm there is a 30-60 minute wait and about 4 empty tables. There is a sense of confusion and priorities are not focused on customer service. The bathroom was a disaster. I've seen better kept facilities at night clubs and that worries me. You know what they say about the bathroom - it is as clean as the kitchen! 
Like I said, they had folks out the door by 7:30 and I had to go up to the register to pay because no one came by to pick up my tab/card. We had 2 dinners and 2 rounds of happy hour drinks - we paid $70. For that kind of money, I would at least expect to be seated at one  of the many open tables that were available when we left. Instead, they let people wait for over 30 mins while others (me) had to wait 20 mins to pay. I think I'd go back but maybe just do take out."}
{"text":"Well, living downtown teaches you a few things and one is that if a restaurant is in a sketchy area, it must be DELICIOUS! I take people here for lunch and always recommend the black mole chicken taco.  They first read the ingredient and make a face (the word chocolate throws them off).  Everyone loves it after eating it! They end up ordering more tacos and horchata to go!  The veggie taco is my other favorite. Don't expect nice tables, décor and easy parking - you might have to drive around the corner to park in front of a chained linked house with weed grown up to the roof but the food is worth a try."}
{"text":"Ate here with my wife several times, and have brought friends. The good is always great. I love the gaucho tacos (I order them every time), but honestly everything is good. The salsa bar is also a lot of fun. I plan to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"the horchata is ok .. not the best. from what i read on the reviews i was expecting more.  Enjoy the variety of salsa and the meat was good too"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by my last 2 visits here. On one visit I was served cold beans and rice, like from the fridge cold. It took almost 20 minutes to get new beans and rice, and they were still barely warm. No apology, no nothing.

Went again to get my favorite chicken mole tacos, and they were barely warm. My husband had their marinated shredded pork in a burrito and got sick after taking the first bite. This must be an acquired taste, it was gross, really gross. Then I found what looked like a gray slimy booger in my rice. When I pointed it out to the server he took my plate away and came back saying it was an onion!! No way was that an onion, or even a close relative of an onion. No apology, no asking if i want something else, he just came over, slammed the bill down and said we didn't charge you for your food, so don't worry about it, and walked away. 

I know mistakes happen, but own up to it, and at least TRY to make the customer feel good about the situation."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix for Spring Training (The Cubs) and decided we wanted Mexican food for dinner.  The food was good, the Atmosphere OK and the service was a little slow.  We enjoyed their Salsa bar and the guacamole was very good.We'll most likely come back next year."}
{"text":"A good friend refered me to this restaurant as we were on a Taco shop kick for the month. i had no idea tacos could be so amazing. The salsa bar is out of this world."}
{"text":"At the outset, I want to say that the rating isn't because of the food; the food is great. The service....well, they need to work on it. I ordered some food to take out and showed up to get it. I could see the bags behind the counter; I asked a number of times if they were mine. I got blank looks. Finally, someone stopped to look and told me that they couldn't figure out who took my order so they couldn't pull up the order on their POS system. You can imagine what cold tacos and burritos taste like. 
The salsas are the best ever; they serve them on a salsa bar and let you pick the ones you want. However, there were no lids for the containers for take out...

If you go there, expect to wait; it is popular. Expect slow service. Expect good food."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a local. I have to say, wow. This is the kind of place I've been craving in Phoenix. There is a large variety of tacos and I struggled to make it through four. I just wanted to try them all! 

I highly recommend this place. The mahi taco at the bottom of the menu is to die for. The shrimp one with like hibiscus was also good. 

We all ordered margaritas and they were fantastic. 

Service was slow but very friendly. They expanded and it seems they just don't have the staff to keep up. We weren't bored or in any rush so there wasn't any issue. 

I unfortunately won't be spending much more time in phoenix, but when I do, I'll be hanging at this place."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place and couldn't be happier to have them on the west side!  Fresh, unique, incredibly delicious food in a comfortable atmosphere and contrary to other reviews, our service has always been exemplary!  Not at all the typical swimming-in-grease-and-cheese Mexican food but fresh and interesting and an extensive menu!  We are regulars and have hardly made a dent at trying everything they offer!  The salsa bar is like no other and stands on its own in making this a must-go destination!  Give this great restaurant a try....you won't be disappointed.  Then, tell all your friends and family so one of Glendale's best restaurants stays here!"}
{"text":"Cochinito tacos are so tender and tasty!!  Not your run of the mill Mexican.  This pleasures the palate!! Unique and fantastic.  I will be making the drive to La Condesa again!"}
{"text":"If you can get seated next to the salsa bar, then SCORE!! Lol.  So many tasty salsa's to choose from.  Try them all!!!!!!! The veggie tacos are delicious!  I love the peanut salsa and cilantro salsa.   A new favorite is to mix the jicama salsa with the cilantro salsa. Sooo good.  My go to is the bullet burrito.  I love me a good bean burrito.  The house margarita is big, fresh squeezed, and swimming with citrus pieces to nibble on.  It is so delicious!  My favorite menu item is the quesa!! The Smoked Marlin, and the veggie quesas are loaded with flavor! Oh, and try the guacamole! They put cranberries and jicama in it.  I hope you'll love it as much as I do.   :)"}
{"text":"What a great tasting Mexican joint. Went on Taco Tuesday. So I decided on the 3 taco  plate with beans and rice. The beans and rice were the standard issue sides. But the tacos!!!! I opted for the brisket taco, carne taco and pollo. (Chicken) All three were great. They give you the standard chips when you sit down to snack on. Nice thing is there is a salsa bar too!!! Our server was great, smile from ear to ear. I definitely recommend giving them a try. You will not be disappointed!!! Oh, and look for the famous guy on the wall!!!"}
{"text":"Great divey burrito joint. I had la santisima burrito and it was fantastic! it looks a little sketchy from the outside but once you step inside this place is adorable and intimate. They have a great salsa bar where you help yourself. I am very excited to go back again and try more."}
{"text":"My boss bought the office lunch today, and la Santisima was the chosen place.
I ordered the La Condesa Veggie Quesa. The portion is huge! It was pretty tasty. But I wish there had been far more veggies. I regret not asking for a side of salsa. 
While a deep fried quesadilla is a novel idea, it was just too heavy and greasy. We ordered take out so had I known it was fried, I would have picked something else. 
I'll definitely give it another try since all my co-workers loved their tacos and burros."}
{"text":"I like the options of salsa, but the place was dirty. The table was dirty, the chairs were dirty and they have some type of fly clear along the edges of the windows. The service was okay, it took forever to get our food of tacos, which I do not understand the turnover time to make tacos. If their excuse for the wait is because its made from scratch, then this place is not the place to go for food. I gave it 2 stars because I feel this place might have been good at one point, they just needs clean house and retrain."}
{"text":"We were looking for some mexican food and I stumbled upon this place.  What a treat!  The food was really good, especially the Quesas and Tacos.  They have a great salsa bar as well and Real Coke.

The parking is a little tough and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table, but the food taste and quality was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have never loved tacos. This place changed my mind... The quality and size of their tacos surpasses that of America's (Sorry America's Taco Shop lovers) and it adds a strong local cultural vice that other taco shops lack with its Dia de los Muertos themed paintings. The meat is well-marinated (especially the carne asada) and the dozen-plus salsas are each different by tasty and made to perfection. You can spend ten-to-fifteen minutes just sorting through the salsa bar. I am lucky enough to live nearby and I take advantage of the shark tacos on most days :) I am so glad that it's caught on! I know that I will keep coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely busy on the weekends. Best time to go is during the weekdays or after the weekend afternoon rush. The horchata is quite unique. Love the salsa bar with a variety of different salsas! Everything on the menu is pretty good! I would recommend any of tacos."}
{"text":"Great decor, nice place. Food was okay but my perfectly made  spicy michelada made up for it. Defiantly recommend"}
{"text":"Solid three and a half stars, rounded up because I am feeling magnanimous today . Others have already waxed rhapsodic about the high points of this little hidden gem: the decor (slightly kitschy, somewhat modern and a pinch of rustic), the salsa bar (over ten types, freshly made and flavorful without the tastebud massacre of straight hot chilis), and the horchata (yummy and light, made unique with the addition of finely chopped cantaloupe and strawberries and a sprinkle of pecans). 

Being a quesadilla fanatic, I got the veggie one. Now, mind you, I had not read any reviews prior to my visit, so I was somewhat disconcerted  by the three pound Mexican calzone that arrived. I'm not complaining -- it was quite tasty -- but the puffy, doughy corn \"tortilla\" exterior was a bit much for me. Oh yeah, and the five handfuls of cheese inside of it. Too much. The damn thing was so big, it eventually became three meals.

My SO, the ultimate Mexican food snob, dug his chicken burro, although it was overstuffed and gooing and oozing everywhere, requiring him to attempt to consume it with a (cheap, flimsy plastic) knife and fork. Try cutting a hot, goopy mess wrapped in a tortilla sitting on a single thin piece of paper on a wicker basket with bendy cheap utensils. Yeah. Total mess. Not first-date friendly.

The location, parking, and service are questionable, as others have noted. We beat the rush by going late morning; I didn't think the wait for the food was unreasonable, but I wouldn't be stopping in here for a bite if I was in a hurry.  While I loved the horchata, the fruit was chopped just finely enough to go shooting up the straw unexpectedly. Total choking hazard for the less physically coordinated (read: me). 

Overall, pretty, pretty good. We'll be back, although I'll pass on the quesadilla next time..."}
{"text":"Came in at around 4PM on a Saturday, parking was terrible but we assumed it had to be good since the parking lot was packed. Walked in and the whole front room was packed with patrons so we waited patiently to be seated. The artwork was phenomenal and the full bar was inviting, but after five minutes of not being acknowledged in any way, we were starting to lose patience. Finally we were seated in the back room, which is much larger and at the time nearly empty except for two groups of 5 people.

We both ordered three tacos each, which were way pricier than we were expecting, they range between 3.99 and 5.50 each or you can do a mix and match plate. Many of their options are seafood so that limited us a bit since we aren't fans, though if you like seafood maybe you'll have better luck than we did!

The salsa bar is extensive so we were excited, we loaded up 12 mini condiment cups, filling them with everything from clearly pico to some more mysterious salsas. Tried out a few on the chips as we waited for our food and found that none of them were spicy in any way, the best was the Pico and another similar to it. 

Finally our tacos arrived and we dug in. Well we tried to. Instead we each ate about half of each taco (except for the barbiccoa which both of us got, I ate both of them after he discovered he hated it). Each taco ranged from bad to almost inedible. Each taco was miniscule, barely the size of my hand and barely filled except for the lack luster and down right gross tasting garnish. The meat quality on the other habd was great, tasteless but great quality so there was room for it to be delicious, they just failed that goal. In the end the only tacos I could suggest were the barbiccoa, which I found good enough to even crave again but for the price and how lacking everything else was, I can guarantee we will not be returning.

I would suggest this place to anyone with family or friends who like a great setting and casual drinks with some small bites, especially if they're not generally fans of Mexican food. The place is inviting and interesting with plenty of tasteless options to explore."}
{"text":"i reallllly need to come here more often. this is definitely a little gem of a mexican restaurant that fires on all cylinders. 

the restaurant itself is adorable-i love all the awesome dia de los muertos paintings on the walls and the unique decor. while it isn't in the greatest neighborhood, you'd have no idea once you walked inside.  

the salsa bar! oh my god, i don't even know where to start with how amazing this thing is.  i am a huge salsa fan (wouldn't mind eating it with every meal, or as a meal, whatever) and i've never known of a restaurant to have so many options! i could literally come here and only eat chips and salsa for hours and never get bored because of all the choices! 

horchata! they put an interesting spin on the horchata by adding pecans and fresh fruit to it.  i thought this might be weird since i've never had it that way, but it was totally delicious and refreshing.  

food! the menu is packed with delicious items that have some unbelievable flavors.  i recommend the carne asada burrito or the bullet (bean and cheese).  

i'll be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get real Mexican food for good prices. They dont take reservations so keep that in mind. The service is great. The salsa is great"}
{"text":"the scoop: 
a) shark taco was really good. love the cilantro salsa in it. 
b) mole poblano with chicken burro was flavorful. and the way to make a burro is by shredding the meat. it was great! 
c) the oversized horchata was unique. expect it to be more like a dessert rather than a drink. it's large, so consider sharing it amongst your party.
d) the best salsa bar i've been too. love the cilantro salsa and pecan salsa."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this Phoenix gem!  I stumbled upon it when I was out house hunting & my husband learned about it from a co-worker, so we tried it one night & have been hooked ever since!  The salsa bar is awesome & the food is fantastic!  We are so happy to live just a few short miles from here & we go often!"}
{"text":"I like the salsa bar!  Good to try at least once.  The horchata was yummy with all its chunky bits of nuts and fruit in it.  Those are the only good things I have to say!!  I didn't really like the food that much.  Not much vegetarian selection.  I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I seriously can say that the foods are yummy and the customer service is excellent. If you are visiting, I can recommend their margarita in addition to their vegan taco. I must say I loved my visit here. I definitely will return here."}
{"text":"wow!  i have never been to a taco shop like this!!!!!!

outside of the restaurant looks like in the ghetto and a little hard to find.  there is parking in front, side and across the street of the restaurant.

the ambiance is really nice.  cool paintings on the wall and very small and only a few tables available.  since the restaurant is small it gets real noisy.  oh and plus a bar with seating.  during lunch this place fills up fast.

once you sit down someone will bring some chips.  next, you walk yourself over to the salsa bar to select from the 14 salsas available.  kinda cool and different.  i'm a wuss when it comes to hot stuff but gave it a shot.  i loved the strawberry salsa and it was dang good!

when you order you need to place your food order at the bar.  we ordered the mayan cochinita pibil taco and oaxaca black mole chicken shark taco.  for too adults i thought it was pricey for 2 tacos per plate with a small portion of beans & rice.  all freaking good but a little too spicy for our taste buds.  for the record we still loved it.

this place is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"La Santisima is my fav! Just be forewarned the service is really, really slow. But everyone is so nice and the food and drinks are incredible. I recommend the tampico marg and the salsa bar is delightful!"}
{"text":"Typically I am a person who only eats burritos with meat, pico, and some hot sauce.... Not anymore! Gaucho? Burrito is amazing! The combination of meat, cheese, vegetables and rice come together for an incredible symphony of flavors! Not to mention the tortilla had that perfect slight crisp but still chewiness. Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!  The food is savory, genuine Mexican food that is reasonably priced.  We tried tacos, tortas & the cohinita pibil burrito - all were succulent!  The salsa bar is great, you can try several or all.  The place is not fancy and you don't really get a waitress, you get in line, order your food & pay, take a number & drink, then someone will take your food to your table.  Give it a try!  You won't be disappointed.  Parking is tough - limited."}
{"text":"Santi and I came to La Santisima looking for a good Mexican fare, and walked away pleasantly surprised by the overall experience. The small, squared-shaped interior included a small dining area, a full salsa bar, kitchen, and a small bar area in the back. The wall-to-wall paintings and artifacts were striking, and nicely added to the casual and festive atmosphere. The menu consisted of an eclectic listing of gourmet tacos, street tacos, burros, deep-fried corn quesadillas, and lonches. 

The Al Pastor Burro ($8.95) arrived with spicy pork, homemade salsa, pineapple, tomato, lettuce, guacamole, onion, cilantro, avocado, and al pastor salsa. The burro was tightly wrapped in hot pressed tortilla. The spicy pork was nicely seasoned with sweet pineapple to brighten the flavors. The rest of the supportive ingredients added subtle touches and kicks. The textures of the onions, lettuce, and tomato were noticeable, but I wished there could be more guacamole to round out the flavors. The burro was sizable, and good to share when cut in half. I recommend it.

The Aztec Tinga Taco and Maya Cochinita Pibil Taco ($9.39) came with rice, black beans with Oaxacan cheese, and two sizable double-decked tacos with shredded meat and red onions layered on top. The Tinga Taco encompassed tender shredded chicken, tomato, and chipotle salsa. I wished there could be more chicken, but the taco was mouthwatering delicious. The Cochinita Pibil was made with pork shoulder wrapped and slow cooked in banana leaves, lime marinated onions and salsa to add acidity and sharpness. Their distinctive taste from one another made the experience worthwhile. The rice and black beans were not simple fillers, but instead they were surprisingly flavorful and addictive. 

The Tialoc Veggie Burro ($8.95) was put together with mesquite-grilled cactus, caramelized onion, garlic, tomato, mushrooms, jalapeno, and Oaxacan cheese in a tightly wrapped hot pressed tortilla. Personally, I prefer the soft, spongy, and stretchable flour tortillas, but the firm and hot pressed version was surprisingly good, resilient, and held everything together quite well. The grilled cactus came in large pieces, and the pleasant textures nicely complemented the generous earthy mushrooms. The Burro could taste bland for some people, but the addition of melted Oaxcan cheese added nuances to the sweet and savory flavors. If I were to order this again, I would add guacamole and more cheese to the mix. 

Lastly, the Arabe Burro ($12.99) had plenty of al pastor, hummus, aguacate, pastor salsa, lettuce, cucumber, tomato, red onion, avocado, red pepper, and Tzatziki dressing on top. In this case, cognitive dissonance can be a good thing, as this Arabic-inspired burro was a hit. The sweet and spicy pastor coupled nicely with the smooth hummus, and the support ingredients rounded out the flavors by bridging flavors of the two worlds. This is one of the worthy items for those looking for an adventure, along with their great looking deep-fried corn quesadillas at many tables. 

The chips were refilled upon request. Among the 12-salsa options, my favorites were the chunky chipotle, smoky Cabo, sweet pecan, spicy Mexicana, peanut, and spicy avocado. Unfortunately, the cilantro salsa had an overpowering sour cream flavor, and some of the other options were too watery, didn't register, or live up to my expectations. 

The restaurant can get very busy throughout the day, so service was not their strongest attribute on each visit. The food took some time to arrive, but the salsa bar and complimentary chips were there to scale down the hunger pains. I thought the prices were a bit higher than San Francisco and Los Angeles. However, there was a nice mix of original and innovative flavors to set them apart. Quality-wise, the food was less greasy when compared to a traditional taqueria. Interested diners should come open minded, and not expecting the most authentic fare. I hope to return to try their Oaxacan Shrimp Mole Burro, Chicken Mole Street Taco, and Pumpkin Flan. 3.5 stars for the overall experience."}
{"text":"Omg - their Salsa bar is amazing.. A bit spicy but I like spicy.. Horchata was delicious.. their  guacamole has tiny pieces of mango and cranberries - it's semi sweet and just so good.. I hear mole sauce is just heavenly but since I don't eat meat - wasn't able to taste it :( do try their rice - it's flavoured with cilantro and garlic and has tiny pieces of corn.. Everything was just perfect.."}
{"text":"Good food but service is lacking.  Self service, sort of.  No trash cans, no easy refills.  Food is well worth the experience, though."}
{"text":"We went to this place on Sunday around 12:20, and they only had one server. We could place the order 40min after we got the seats. How come do they have one server on Sunday? Waitress never came to take the order, so many people just left. Ordered horchata, and it was the worst horchata ever. They have various kinds of salsas, but tastes are just fine. Nothing really special. Price is little bit higher than other Mexican restaurants. I Do Not recommend this place."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!!!  Bomb street tacos!  YES!!!  Their salsa bar is awesome sauce (pun intended)!  House margaritas also fabulous!  An all around great find, I WILL be back!!!"}
{"text":"We flew into Arizona, jet lagged and hungry. This taco spot was near by and food network featured it. 
Outside the place looked a little sketchy, but inside it looked like a typical taco spot. We got fresh chips to start. And then we ordered about 3 tacos per person (all of them were good!). 
The best thing about this place is their salsa bar. They have everything from pico to strawberry to pecan salsa. Some were spicy, some sweet. It's insane. And delicious. 
Pretty cool and simple taco spot in Phoenix. Small dining area though, so don't get mad if there's a wait."}
{"text":"So much deliciousness packed into just one restaurant .... Quality ingredients and superb preparation are the cornerstones here. The food is inventive enough to be unique, without adding cuckoo ingredients for flair or deconstructing everything. Service is friendly and helpful. The location is easily accessible, has nice parking, and is thankfully more spacious than the 16th St location.

Do yourself a favor and try the queso fundido appetizer (I added in shrimp), the bean dip (I mean whaaat, since when are refried beans good?!), literally any quesa, the shrimp taco, lots of rice (I literally never eat the rice at most restaurants) and, last but not least, the horchata!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! Lots of \"gourmet taco\" restaurants around these days and they're for the most part good. But this place seems more like a gourmet taco place you would find in Mexico. Real  authentic ingredients put together in different ways. I had the shredded pork tacos. The pork was so tender and flavorful, they didn't even need salsa added to them. speaking of salsa, this place features a salsa bar with around a dozen different salsa varieties: jicama salsa, peanut salsa, radish salsa, just to name a few of the crazy ones. To top it off, there's some pretty amazing artwork on the walls. Even the bathroom doors are beautiful. This place is a must try! I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I loved the food! It has great authentic food and it is all fresh. My only downside for not giving it 5 stars is the size of the place. It can fit probably around 20 people max. I think they need to move to a bigger location. Service was ok as well, give them a past because of the busyness."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Phoenix.  Parking sucks, the neighborhood is meh, and the dining room is a mess, but all that melts away once you eat a taco (the Tinga is my favorite).  They have all the meats, and all the salsas, and it is taco heaven.  Come midday if possible, because there is a line every night."}
{"text":"My buns and and I went around 1:30 pm and it was not busy, nice atmosphere, delicious food and $5 Tuesday margaritas? Perfect! The food was delicious and I would definitely come back when back in town :)"}
{"text":"There are a number of Mexican food restaurants in the area, but this is probably the best one. Great fish tacos and plenty of salsa to choose from."}
{"text":"My waiter came to my table to take my order and came again to give me my check. No refills on drinks or nothing. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been to La Santisima twice, and it's definitely one of my favorite Mexican places ever already. It was what changed me from being someone who didn't like Mexican (though I grew up where the only Mexican was Plaza Azteca-level Mexican) to someone who loves it and is excited to try more!

PROS:
- The salsa bar: Great flavors and variety! My favorite was the Mexicana, but mixing the pecan with the jicama was also divine. We accidentally tried the strawberry salsa (it was unlabeled when we went, and we thought it would be spicy), but it was also surprisingly delicious!
- The food: I ordered the taco plate both times. I arrived starving and left stuffed beyond measure with a to-go box in hand (and I eat a lot.) I ordered the Cabo shrimp taco and the Pacific white fish tacos on separate occasions, and they were both fried perfectly, without being too fishy (which I like). I loved their chicharrones taco, but my boyfriend (who doesn't have general sentimental, warm and fuzzy feelings towards chicharrones like I do) found it a little tough. I can't currently remember the names of the other tacos I got, but they were all phenomenal. I've also heard great things about the burros. Just thinking about it makes me hungry again.  

CONS:
- The service: I'm not sure what about the service makes it so slow; the first time I went, it was packed, and understandably, service was slow. But yesterday, I went and there were probably 15 tables open, two groups ahead of us, and it took about 20 minutes for us to get seated, with no explanation for why we weren't being seated. Additionally, someone at my table ordered a bottle of wine and it took them about 10 minutes to come back and say \"Sorry, we don't have that. Would you like something else?\"

Tl;dr: If you have time to kill and good company, definitely worth going to. If you care about service quality and speed, maybe not."}
{"text":"Tire of the old sonoran style Mexican food? Find a taste of deep southern Mexico food here! The rice is not red/orange YAY, finally! and the orchata is a nutty and fruit infusion! I drive from afar to this place because its definitely a different class of Mexican food. The wait is pretty long so I don't recommend if you are dying of starvation lol but it is worth the wait. I recommend coming during off peak time frames to grab a seat, wait and enjoy"}
{"text":"I'll make this quick: the food is phenomenal. No, seriously. Every flavor is on point. Tacos; perfect amount of meat to tortilla ratio. Queso fundido; real cheese, real hot, real good. And their specialty, the Quesas; a fantastic crunchy but \"doughy\" masa filled with excellent ingredients. Like a big fried empanada made with masa, but much tastier. 

So why am I giving this a 4 out of 5? Well... simple; service. The young staff seems overwhelmed and not very knowledgeable. There is a sense of chaos, which is typical in this current \"hip\" culture of food dining nowadays. But there is chaos and organized chaos. This is not the latter. While friendly, they really need to get their act together cause I came back for the food alone just two days later. 

Delicious place...."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Really really good! Great atmosphere as well. Definitely recommend for Mexican food lovers!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelp!  What a wonderful place.  I had three street tacos -  al pastor, chicken and cauliflower.  My friends had burritos and raved about them, too.  Nice salsa bar, too."}
{"text":"YUCK! Craving Mexican food so my friend and I decided to stop at this place for some burritos. We were impressed with the large selection at the salsa bar. When we got our stale store-bought, rubbery chips the salsa wasn't so appealing after all. We both ordered chicken burritos and were shocked when we got a basket with a tortilla filled with soggy chicken bits and bean soup. It wasn't possible to use a fork and knife in a basket so we tried to pick them up and the burritos spilled all over our hands. It was a mess! I asked the waitress to look at the menu again because we were not satisfied with the burritos. I hate to waste food but we could not force ourselves to eat them. She said we had to pay for the burritos and then she would give us \"one\" taco. She made us feel very uncomfortable as she waved her \"one\" finger in our faces so I told her we would pay for the food and then look at the menu again. She immediately brought me the check and waited over my shoulder for me to pay for it before she handed us the menus. Her angry attitude scared us, so we no longer wanted to look at the menu. We just wanted to leave and try out another restaurant. I would not recommend dining at this place. The quality of food was horrible and the service was even worse. Waitress with vile attitude and crappy food equals a no win situation. You're better off dining at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Any trip to Phoenix is incomplete without a stop to La Santisima.  Their salsa bar is epic, and I don't use words as such lightly. Great, original veggie entrees as well. Well worth the short wait."}
{"text":"service a 2, food a 5!!!!! you need this experience at least. highly recommend shrimp taco, cochinita pibil and mole negro....."}
{"text":"Tacos are authentic! Salsa bar is awesome. There can be a bit of a wait but when you get to your table they already have chips there waiting for you ! Burritos / burros are huge and they grill the tortilla, nice touch. Servers are awesome but a little short staffed.
Try the tamarindo margarita!!"}
{"text":"The tacos here were amazing! I had a shrimp taco and the black mole taco. It was great!! The salsa bar has a huge selection of fresh made salsas. My only complaint would be that they were out of guacamole when I came in which broke my heart. But next time I'm definitely going to try it. The margaritas are definitely spot on too, definitely a must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Ya'll are as high as our super sweet but (holyeffingshit) slow server with your 5 star reviews. Come on already. I've been twice, both experiences were about 1:30-2p in the afternoon, aka the end of most restaurants lunch rush. The first time, the waiter spilled Sprite on my husband and apologized but never came back to help with it because they were so busy. BUT THAT FILET BURRITO THOUGH. Took damn near an hour but it was so freeeeaking delish. So, I went again, with the same naïveté as most of you, hoping it was an off day. W R O N G. Today we waited 10 minutes for water, 15 minutes for chips and 50 minutes for food. 1.5 hrs in total for a (holyeffingshit) $17 delicious chicken burrito plate, some tacos and a horchata. 

Being in the industry, I was watching the people around me like a hawk-- I cannot help it. Restaurant management runs through my blood and is 99.8% of the time a curse because I notice every flipping detail and rarely enjoy myself when out to eat. Today, I noticed two servers in a packed restaurant. Maybe 3-4 kitchen staff. No bartender although a lot of booze was being ordered. I watched 3 customers walk out after not being greeted at their table and 9 (yes, nine) take off after waiting at the door for a table for way too long when there were clean tables inches from them. People were making their frustrations known and some were honestly pretty pissed. I am really confused why they don't switch to counter service, it make SO much more sense for their concept. 
 
No mediocre free salsa bar and damn tasty but super overpriced food is worth this kind of service."}
{"text":"Dude.

I love this place. It's walking distance from my house, that is baaaad news for my thighs. I've driven past it multiple times and it never caught my eye. Finally, I did notice their large statue thingy outside of the establishment. It was all lit up as I drove by during the evening. When I realized it was a gourmet taco shop, I knew I had to go asap. 

I went with my boyfriend and we both went to TOWN on their chips and assorted salsas. My favorite was the pecan salsa. Sweet and spicy! For our meals, he ordered 3 tacos and I ordered 2. The pork tacos were slightly bland and made me worry at first that I was going to be let down, but then came the chicken mole taco - oh my! Delicious! Sweet and savory, it was perfect. I know that sauce is difficult to make too, so, well done. Most of the tacos actually don't come with cheese - you know why? Because the tacos are so bomb you don't even need the cheese really. Their flavors are very carefully picked to taste a certain way. Save the cheese and salsa for the chips! You'll enjoy the tacos just as they are.

YUM!"}
{"text":"Uusual selection of tacos, excellent condiment bar - at least ten different salsas - and some funky modern Mexican art. Worth the occasional wait."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great surprise, You can definitely taste the quality in the food! Great selection of salsa and the menu has a variety for all. The good isn't over done to the point where you can't finish your plate. I will most definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"I just returned to this restaurant and now that they've expanded, things have changed for the worse. The service was abysmal, the place is so dark you can't see, it smells bad, and the lighting consists of some spotlights tacked onto the ceiling that shine right into your eyes if you are unlucky enough to sit at a bad table. 

I ordered my usual tacos and the cheese shells were burned, the tortilla chips were oily, and the meat quality was tough and chewy. The prices have also skyrocketed! 

My love affair with this place is officially over. Sorry."}
{"text":"Love there tacos... They have diff flavors then most tacos places. Deff worth trying you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Small spot with beautiful original artwork hanging on the walls. Food was spectacular."}
{"text":"Incredible food. The kind of place you go to on repeat while visiting Phoenix. They have an incredible salsa bar! I ordered the Oaxacan Black Mole Quesa- it was unreal. The outside was perfectly crisp and the chicken, slow marinated in mole sauce, was life changing. Their margaritas are massive so you really only need 1. I got the spicy marg!! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Great place to take out-of-towners. These are show and tell tacos, pricy and small portions surrounded by beautiful art and murals. You can definitely get cheaper tacos elsewhere without all the fuss. This is the BEST a-la-carte salsa bar in town, but the small plastic containers are inadequate."}
{"text":"This place is so busy it's ridiculous. I was willing to give it a try and understand that it was during lunch time but the bad experiences kept coming. Busy time means no chips unless you ask for it. One of the bartenders, who I think was the owner was, running around opening doors and wiping the sweat off his head and still had time to make a margarita without washing his hands and grabbing the straw right from where the guest was going to put his lips on. Good thing it wasn't my margarita... While I'm waiting I go to the restroom which was poorly cleaned. Pee... everywhere which again the person before me could of been the one to do it but get this... no hand soap. I hope the employees were washing their hands after using the restroom. So, finally get my food which looks good until I look at the basket which was holding the food and see there is dried gunk from whoever used it before me. Beans. Rice. Salsa. It was all dried on there. I took my wrapper out of the basket and set it aside. Already grossed out by the dirtiness I decided I was never coming back. As soon as I got home after my 20 minute drive I immediately began feeling sick... I wonder why. I really don't even wanna think how much germs I came in contact with."}
{"text":"The last 3 trips to Phoenix we've made have included a stop at La Santisimo.  The best street tacos I've ever had.  Their mole sauce is extraordinary, the steak gaucho tacos are killer good, the horchata is sooooo good.  On top of all that, the huge variety of salsas at the salsa bar will keep you coming back for more.  My favorite is the peanut salsa.  WARNING:the pecan salsa is HOT!"}
{"text":"HOLD THE TACO! This place is legit! The restaurant is small, and cramped, but I get it... the food was carefully made with a genuine love of feeding people and they want to feed as many as they can in their small space. 

The tacos were legit, the fish tacos were amazeballs, and the veggie options were ridiculous. I had a shrimp taco, and a veggie taco, both were outstanding. The fresh salsa bar was ridiculous too, in a good way :)

Go here, eat tacos, thank me later.

Note, lots of pescie and veggie options! #veggie4life #veggielife #pescielife"}
{"text":"I love this taco shop!! The salsa bar was great with so many options to choose from. The employees were very friendly too.  I had the pastor Quesa and it was amaizing!"}
{"text":"So so awesome!! The salsa bar was huge and armed with more types of salsa than I could possibly taste in one sitting. Anyway the tacos were more than filling and very tastey. As far as the location lets just say I drove past it and had to do a u-turn. I was not expecting it to be \"right next to\" La perila. Which is another mexican food place but has been around for quite awhile. So here you go.... If you are looking for a mexican dish enchilada style that can be eaten with a soup spoon?? Go to La Perila, which is good don't get me wrong. But if your looking for a flavor party of some really good authentic mexican food go to La Santisma. There is a good chance you too will be excited to share this place with others. Don't want to forget the staff was very friendly and helpful. The layout of this place is cool and family like. Nice front patio that would be pretty cool come sundown. Welp Enjoy I sure did and will again."}
{"text":"I rarely rave about places to eat, but I'm telling you this is legit!  Drink the house margarita and enjoy the cochinita pibil burrito!"}
{"text":"How much do I love this place?

Well I live in Washington state and I've made a flight layover in Phoenix just to run grab some lunch here. 

The salsa bar is amazing. Tons of unique flavors. My only critique would be the avocado salsa is a little too spicy for me. Otherwise I really enjoy almost all the salsas.

The main reason I come here though is for the Mole Quesadilla! Their quesadillas are not your standard fair, they are deep fried, and filled with whatever you order with them. If you are a mole lover, this should not be missed! I've yet to find another place that I can get this dish as good, hence the reason I will make alterations to my flight plans to eat here!

Also when you go don't forget to order a horchata, they are giant and filled with extras!"}
{"text":"The food is what saves this place... AMAZING!!! staff is friendly but always seems to be \"short handed\", so drink refills and check backs are hit and miss."}
{"text":"Husband introduced me to this place yesterday and I was totally impressed. Donot pass up the cilantro or pecan salsas!"}
{"text":"Loved the tacos. Def something different from your regular Mexican restaurant. My favorite thing is the salsa bar!! So much variety! And the horchata?!.... so delish! Only thing was the wait to order and food. Busy place at lunch. But I think the food is worth it. But don't come if your in a rush"}
{"text":"Not impressed, after reading the comment i though it would be a great spot, but wish i didnt go there honestly"}
{"text":"Great, cozy ambiance. Great service. Complex, unique, and absolutely delicious flavors on everything that I've tried (tacos, quesadilla, salsa, margaritas). The quesadilla is unlike any other I've ever seen or tasted, and absolutely the best. The margaritas are the best I've had in the valley, and the happy hour price for them is amazing. 
Their menu is so awesome too, so many things that are unique and not commonly found."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Hole in the wall with the most unassuming store front but delicious salsa bar with great authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Really great vegetarian meals. Salsa variety is great, my favorite is the strawberry one. I had a vegetarian burrito enchilada style that I'm craving right now"}
{"text":"Wow! This was an incredible experience! Staff were friendly and super helpful. The quesa was  the best thing we've ever tasted and the street tacos were awesome!"}
{"text":"Best local Mexican food Ever!!!! Amazing service, Amazing Food, Amazing Salsa bar!!!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? We are on our trip out here from Los Angeles, California and on our way back home we stopped here. First , the salsa bar is amazing!!! Sooo many choices and different ideas than what I'm used to. I ordered a few tacos al a carte and the meats are sooo good and the sauces they use are super tasty. I will be definitely be telling my friends about this place when I get back."}
{"text":"Great place! Awesome food, best salsa bar in town. 
Clean environment and very friendly staff. We will definitely be back again. The breakfast menu is really good and pricing is reasonable."}
{"text":"I have to say, I thought it may have been a pipe dream to think that because Phoenix is closer to the Mexican border that we may be able to find better Mexican restaurants here. But the theory proved true. I'm from Minneapolis, where good Mexican places are few and far between, the only good one I can think of being Los Ocampo. 

This place had the best salsa bar I've seen yet. The steak tacos I had were excellent; the meat was moist and flavorful with no gristle and little fat. They would have been even better with a little cilantro though. The rice and beans were some of the best I've had; the rice was a tad soft/wet but the flavor was spot on. We had margaritas, apparently on special, for only $3 a pop. They were tasty but strong enough-enough that I had to let my husband finish mine off because I was driving.
The only thing I would say needs improvement is the ambiance; my chair was uncomfortable and difficult to scoot in and out from the table, which was a big pain and drew attention to us when I attempted to nurse our baby. The chairs could use reupholstering too.

Tip: their parking is out front but easy to miss when you're driving down 16th, which is a busy thoroughfare with a speed limit of 45 (?) don't quote me on that but people drive FAST."}
{"text":"Awesome taco and salsa choices, but no big crowds.

For a foodie, it's great there are no long lines and waits for seating, but peoples, YOU'RE MISSIN' OUT! In Saturday for lunch, had a seat at the empty bar. Tables mostly full, but not jammed with folks. Good for me though, service was quick, and room to kick back.

Ordered Azteca Tinga and Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken tacos, but oddly, was served Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco instead of the Azteca. I double-checked with the server 'cuz the Cochinita was absolutely mouth-watering! Over-the-top when paired with the Cilantro salsa (just a touch). A definite repeat item. Black Mole was certainly delivered as described, with dark, somewhat smokey-molasses flavor, but a bit too heavy for me.

Ti[p: Pick just two-to-three salsa to sample, and then decide on how best to enjoy them-some just with chips, others to top off a taco. How to be sure what's best? Duh, come back again!"}
{"text":"The best in PHX. My favorite place to go to get food and eat a dope ass meal is here. Let me start off by saying that I fudging love salsa and this place has a salsa bar... case closed. You might have to wait like 30-45 mins but it's well worth it in the end. Trust me."}
{"text":"Peanut salsa (?!?) is insanely good. For veggie lovers, the veggie burrito is super filling and delicious with more than the standard rice, beans and fajita veggies. I'd go here every day for lunch if I worked closer"}
{"text":"Third visit to La Condesa and that's enough to give it a review. I like the flavors, which are largely guided by your personalized salsa choices, but find it to be a bit heavy in portions.

La Condesa is really ALL about the salsa... not just for the chips but utilizing the bar during the whole visit to create your own perfect balance of flavors. Dishes are dialed into a low volume in order to let the salsa sing.  If your meal's not right, it may be that you're putting peanut salsa on charred beef rather than chicken or vegetables.

PORTIONS + VALUE
Two Condesa tacos are way too generous, while three truly street-sized tacos at Gallo Blanco are just perfect for this gal (one reviewer noted the lack of a \"sampler\" style plate, which is true). However my brother in law, the bottomless pit, packed away one queso and two tacos in a single sitting. So if you're a big eater and looking for value, its very fair and you'll get plenty of protein.

THE BEANS
Smooth, smoky, with just a little chunk. Thin enough for dipping, which is crucial for the doughy ends of your fried queso tortilla. I'm impressed at how consistent the beans have tasted across three visits. Portion size has been reviewed as small but when you have that much taco to eat, who has room for beans other than as a condimento?

THE RICE
Nothing to write home about. Pale, underseasoned. On one visit it was sticky. Not what we local eaters expect as \"Mexican Rice\".

THE SALSAS
This is what you come for: salsa on demand. There is an avocado cruda salsa that disappears quickly but is consistently green and fresh, never gray. Chile de arbol salsa has a faint nutty taste. Green tomatillo is delicious. Purple cabbagy condimento is great paired with cochinita as suggested. Salsa Mexicana is not mundane. Cilantro drizzle is a welcome accent. 

TACOS
Taco plates are generously portioned with meat, almost too much in my book but who's complaining? Whisper of selected vegetable garnish included. Tortillas are average quality and may not be steam-fluffed enough. I'll give them this: they don't break. 

BURRITOS
Messy but good. Thin wax paper can't withstand much contact with a knife and fork. The Bullet is a mild no-brainer favorite for kids. 

QUESOS
Decadent! Sinful! Beckoning! The fried dough is pastry-like. Paired with the cohinita pibil it was like having dessert for supper. The extra doughy bits on the seam are particularly yummy dunked in beans. Being a fan of the doughy huarache concept in general, the Queso takes corncake-ness up to eleven.

MOLE NEGRO
A true mole negro, not the sweeter raisin-y ancho-packed type we often get here in town. It's not smoky, but actually charred and a little bitter, with aromatic undertones. Chocolate tones not easily discernable. Different that what you may be used to, but good.

AZTEC CHICKEN TINGA
Adequately wet and seasoned. Tender and easy to pull apart without a knife. Mild on the seasoning, but easily remedied with that ample salsa bar everyone is raving about. This makes Mexican food accessible to all tolerances of heat, in a way.

COHINITA PIBIL
Delicate shreds of well braised pork. Low key on the seasoning but not flavorless. Nice paired with the purple salsa and anything acidic they have out that day.

SEAFOOD
Our bottomless pit had the Ahi and the Dogfish shark and said both were good.

CARNE ASADA
Crunchy but missing the smoke and sizzle I'd expect from a mesquite grilled specialty. It was adequate but lacked a bit of citrus acidity and kick. Competent, and even tasty.  Again, nothing not easily remedied by salsa.

VEGETABLES
How refreshing to have vegetables available for all dishes as entree or add-ons. I added spinach to my Queso in a meager attempt to satisfy a vegetable serving for my meal. It delivered beautifully and added crunch.

BEVERAGES
Horchata and Jaimaica live up to their previous reviews here. Horchata is way too huge for a child. Would love to see a pint-sized version. The full size is a commitment.

THE WAIT
Yes, you might wait. Even if the restaurant is empty. I went for take-out after the lunch rush and waited 20 minutes even though there was only one order ahead of me and there was no line at the counter.  If I had known they were going to pack me a mini-stash of chips in the to-go bag I'd have asked for it in advance to pass the time at the salsa bar while I waited. Post-lunch rush also showed some empty salsa bins but with 12 choices, it just means some of your favorites are in the process of being refilled. We're spoiled here at La Condesa. Most of my favorite true-mex restaurants only offer two, maybe three at the table.

THE ENVIRONMENT
Rustic contemporary/ironic and clean on the surface but not tidy to the  glance when abandoned baskets stack up. They need a self-service trash can like Baja Fresh or Chipotle so the baskets don't accumulate in public view. Would appreciate a commitment to wash cheap silverware. No indication if they recycle the consumables."}
{"text":"We came here on December 23rd, after failing to find a local kebab store that was open.  I remembered the amazing mosaic sculpture and told my buddy, let's try the place with the big Dia de los Muertos lady on the front....and we did.  The Mayan taco was ....well...to use the term orgasmic would be both an understatement and a poor use of the word.  I took my parents there 4 days later and had a similar experience. My dream dinner there is to have many friends, many hours, many many tacos, and many beers or margaritas.  I am impressed with the food quality, but haven't had the beans or rice, I figure why?  They have tacos.  Also, impressive salsa bar with a pink radish salsa that I wanted to drink out of the bowl.  Yes, this is a hedonistic review, but I had a hedonistic time.  Go eat here.  They must never go out of business."}
{"text":"I heard the food was good however service was poor.  I get that Sunday can be a busy day.  The staff should greet people as they walk in and let them know how long is wait.  Instead everyone is ignored.  I really support Latin business owners however it's important to pay attention to all the little things.  It truly does make a difference!!"}
{"text":"This little Phoenix gem delivers everything you want from fine Mexican dining without all the touristy bullshit. The exterior has classic Dia De Las Muertas tile work and the interior is rustic, intimate and clean. The menus and prices are simple and excellent and the food is phenomenal.

The salsa bar is one of the best I have ever experienced. At least 12 different salsas. All different and all excellent, and I believe, made on the premises. We had, Pecan, Peanut Butter, 7 Chili, Mexicano, Pico de Gallo, and Cilantro salsa. If variety is the spice of life, what is a variety of spices?

The absolute, takes the cake reason for 5 stars is the Horchata! I am a fan of Horchata. I have never had Horchata like this! 32 ounces with what must have been muddled strawberries and apples and fresh ground cinnamon. So good, so good."}
{"text":"My family & I ate here for breakfast after the Phoenix heart walk. Being a weekend the place filled pretty quickly. We arrived shortly after the restaurant opened so we quickly greeted and seated. If you're a first timer the place is small, not much space in between table, be weary if you have younger children. We were given a breakfast menu along with the standard menu. Our daughters had pancakes and scrabbled eggs which they both loved. I am the biggest fan of their horchata. I absolutely love it and sometimes stop by for just that. I order the egg Benedict with the option of red or green chili pork. I told the waiter I wanted red chili and he repeated green. I corrected him and requested red chili. Again, this is a smaller place but busy, so don't expect your food quickly. When our food arrived my entire plate was cold. The side of beans were not warm, but cold. My Benedict, also cold and not red chili but green. The poached egg was more boiled as the yoke was solid and not runny. 

I've eaten here before and I have to say this visit was disappointing. I may only return for the horchata or dinner but never again for breakfast."}
{"text":"Not sure how to follow Julie P.'s epic review, but I thought I'd show some support.

La Condesa is a fantastic addition to Central Phoenix. Casual, nice people, amazing food.

Like other reviewers, I'm partial to the Oaxaca black mole chicken and the cochinita pibil. Everything is delicious in any delivery system -- taco, burro, or (gooey and vaguely depraved) quesa.

The salsa bar really gets me, though. Experiencing it is to suffer total cognitive arrest and disorganization; it's like love at first sight or stumbling upon a work of great art. Peanut, cilantro, de arbol... bring a sharpie so you can mark the little plastic cups and remember your favorites.

Bonus points: The server remembered that I'd asked for strawberry salsa (they were out) on my last visit eight days prior, and offered a totally above-and-beyond apology. Must be something in the mole that sharpens the memory. 

Great place -- a gem."}
{"text":"I've been coming to La Santisima for 8 years. The service has always been slow but the food was always hot and spot on.  Recently they switched management and now the food is going downhill. The tacos are smaller, salsa bar is always half full and quality is poor. My go to taco is the Mexi Mignon. It's a grilled piece of filet mignon with a homemade slaw and fried cheese. This taco is out of this world good. However, my last visit they used chopped steak, no slaw, different sauce and fried cheese. This is a $10 taco. I will not be coming back until they bring the quality of their food back. Shame on the owners for cutting corners on what was the best taco place in  AZ."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and the options La Santisima has are phenomenal! I make it a point to try something different every time I visit and have not been disappointed yet. Everything is delicious,  authentic and real. Highly recommend you visit. Have the bean dip to start... you'll thank yourself for doing so."}
{"text":"Tried the tacos. Take the mix and match. You will not be disappointed. The ambience is perfect for a casual date or family gathering alike."}
{"text":"Soo good. The salsa bar is awesome; I've never seen flavors like pecan or peanut before. The horchata is delicious, comes with the lots of fruit inside. The quesas are good if you have a big appetite and like a ton of cheese. Also very tasty tacos."}
{"text":"All I got to say that these were the best taco's I've ever had. Found this place by chance on Yelp by chance on a visit to Phoenix for the Pro Bowl. The salsa selection is good. Next time I'm in town I'll be there again."}
{"text":"Love the salsa bar. 15 varieties. Street tacos rock."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I absolutely love Mexican food (so I believe I have good taste)  and these tacos were literally the best I've ever had ! 

So many salsas at the salsa bar, which is like candy land for someone like me! I had the chicken taco and a shrimp taco (with beer batter) and my sister had the cactus tacos. We born enjoyed our meals quite a bit although my sister liked the cactus tacos from two hippies beach house better (she's vegetarian). 

They were so good you must try!!! I am very picky about Mexican food and only enjoy authentic flavors. The beans were underwhelming , but it's a taco shop, so this rating is based on tacos. Will def be going back the next time I visit Arizona!"}
{"text":"The only words that can express how great this Mexican place are...OMG yummy!  Once you dine at La Santisima you will be hooked for life!  Try to get there before 11:30am or after the lunch crowd 2:00pm or you might have a challenge getting a table."}
{"text":"YUM! Great salsa bar with lots of fun and innovative options. Only problem is you eat so many chips to try out all the salsas- it's hard to remember to leave room for the great tacos."}
{"text":"The salsa bar here is unlike any I've ever seen.. there are probably 20 different ones to choose from and you serve yourself. They even make a strawberry salsa!! My table always has about 8 different little salsa cups all over it for all the different mixings and options. 

Also, I've only ever eaten their tacos and there are two pages to choose from so I will probably continue as they are all completely different and unique. 

The interior is comfy and really artsy. I love this spot!!"}
{"text":"What can you say about a place that has already seen the stamp of approval from Guy Fieri? Well, the positives are quite clear, good food at low prices and an endless salsa bar that pushes boundaries with creations like strawberry salsa. But with this success the whole-in-the-wall charm has been lost. My visit became a transactional act due to poor customer service by the sole waitress attending to all the tables in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I was not disappointed either time. First of all their salsa bar as one of the best I have ever experienced as far as choices and taste. There are tacos and quesadillas are top notch. This place is one of my top five restaurants for Mexican food. I also like that when I get my plate the food is piping hot and you can tell the ingredients are fresh. I find their prices to be very reasonable and their staff was kind and attentive. If you've never been here you have to check this place out. I'm certain he will not be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"Sweet spot! Very cool ambiance. Food was great. Salsa bar was delicious. Pecan salsa was amazing. Never would have thought of and almost did not try, but was the best of the batch. Would have liked a little more spice, but all were good. Shark taco, colors of the flag burrito was stunning. Another combo (meat, raisins, and apples) that was great. Quesadilla was also great. Not the standard quesadilla but better in my opinion. Small with only 10 tables, and things were a bit slow but more than worth it!!"}
{"text":"This place was terrible, I never leave bad reviews, but I was expecting high quality tacos and was very disappointed. After reading numerous articles we decided to check it out on Friday night. To begin with the restaurant is small and loud. We decide to get our food to go instead of waiting. Our order was messed up, I received a meat taco when I ordered something else (I don't eat meat). The rice is congealed and sticky and bland and the beans are runny and unbeatable. I was very disappointed with the customer service and the experience overall. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Food was really good. I had a Quesa and it was not the ordinary quesadilla. The horchata was also unique. I am definitely going back to try the shark tacos. 

I would have given it 5 stars but it was warm in there. In AZ you do not want to go from baking outside to eating in a warm restaurant. There was also only one server working."}
{"text":"This place is very good. Their salsa bar is great with many different selections. Whenever I'm thinking about eating Mexican food, this place always comes to mind."}
{"text":"The praise here is warranted. This is the best Mecican food possibly in the world. 

Service and ambience are awesome. 
You can tell that the salsa bar is clearly insane. I actually wasn't a huge fan of any, but I combined the peanut with some other chipotle salsa and the tomatillo with another green salsa and made two amazing new salsas.

The food is indescribable. You can only understand if you eat it. I've had the carne, pibil, pastor, and mole tacos. The only one I didn't like was mole but it's an acquired taste and I think if you like mole you'll love it. The beans are also super flavorful and the rice is pretty good. It's closer to an Asian fried rice than the Mexican rice I've had, but I'm not complaining! 

The horchata was also like nothing I've ever had. It had cantaloupe, pecans, And strawberries and somehow it still worked out?? You have to have it if you come here.

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place except that I wish they delivered to where I live (NY) hahaha"}
{"text":"A huge selection of gourmet and street tacos.  The variety of fish options appeared to be a huge hit with other options, but we particularly enjoyed the cochinita and carne asada tacos. Decent prices, and fun to try the different salsas from their large salsa stand. Beware it gets quite busy during Saturday lunch, and the seating is a small area. Prepare for a short wait during peak hours or go during off hours. We will probably be back again."}
{"text":"The tacos here are to die for.. The dogfish shark tacos rock.. The salsa bar is absolutely insane, lots of real spicy options.. Kitchy, inexpensive, I feel a must for locals to take your tourists as that \"hole in the wall\" place with some real spunk and guster..Pack some heat.. Its the Ghetto:)"}
{"text":"I thought I reviewed this spot already, but I obviously didn't. I came here  about 4 years ago when it had a different name (la Condesa) and it was my first time coming back since. I came here a month ago with some friends and we drove separately. Some of them got there first which was good because they were able to snag us a table for 6 in this small restaurant. Since it was a Friday night, it was busier than usual and several parties had to wait or go elsewhere. 

Their menu has a lot of options even for vegetarians, which is nice. I ordered a taco plate with three different kinds: aguacate, la santísima veggie, and the cactus one. I did like them, but I would've enjoyed them better if they were served in flour tortillas rather than corn. I'm not a corn tortilla fan. The salsa bar is fun to try, I got the strawberry one to balance out the spicier ones like chipotle. The beans were tasty too. 

Service was good and we got our food in a timely manner. I just wish they had more space and alternate choices for tortillas."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not super close to my house but always worth the drive, or a fun place to stop by if I'm headed to the Ranch Market. You have to be looking for it because it's in a tiny strip mall and could be easily passed up. I love the decorations inside it's Dia de los Muertos themed and all the art work is super cool. They have a salsa bar with tons of different salsas you can try out which is fun and gives you a good variety of spice and flavors (try the strawberry one!). All of the tacos I've had have been delicious but if you do get the plate with 2 tacos and rice and beans you're going to be really full or have half of your plate to take home. I haven't been for the happy hour tacos or whatever it is so I will have to make it by 6 one day for the deal. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Huge and delicious Horchata!
Strawberry salsa!
Shrimp taco!

Those are what I had at my first visit. First it a little bit hard to find the place because we did not know exactly where this place is located at. Once we stepped inside, the artwork on the wall blew us away. 

We started off with the chips and 10 different kinds of Salsa. This is the incredible ideas since none of us love the same kinds of Salsa. I loved Strawberry one. My husband loved 7 chilies. Others also love different kinds, such as green chili and jicama.

Then our meals arrived shortly after. A basket full of tacos, rice and bean. They are all delicious and I have never had the shrimp tacos this good before.

I am glad that La Condesa is not to far from where we live. It is our new spot to go get some delicious food."}
{"text":"Ya'll don't understand.  This is it.  This is the place.  This is as good as it gets.

When people say, \"Know any real Mexican restaurants?\" take them here. When you have people fly in from out of town and say, \"Take me to a hidden hole-in-the-wall spot\" take them here. When you want to impress a date, your parents, or just have delicious meal... take them here.

If you go at prime dinner time it'll be a 15-30 min wait.  But it's so worth it.  You sit down.  They place a complementary basket of chips and you look to the back where there are 10 different salsas.  Yes ten.  And not this made-in-a-bag BS.  Real fresh stuff.  So you get to experiment with these while you wait for your food to come out.  Next, order the Horchata.  Get only one and share.  They are huge.  Their margaritas are also good. Finally, get something with the black mole and/or oaxacan cheese.  

I cannot overstate how amazing their mole sauce is.  All of their food is excellent but the mole... I have no words to describe it.  I have had their black mole tacos, their black mole sandwich and the heavenly Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa which is more like an empanada. 

I am from the Midwest originally.  Before I moved here, I swore off Mexican food.  It was greasy, disgusting, and tasted like hot and salty mush.  This restaurant is probably my single favorite place to eat since moving here 3 years ago.  Treat yourself to this place.  You deserve to know happiness."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both visits were enjoyable.  The food is amazing and the portions are generous.  It is fun to order and share among friends since there is such a variety on the menu - definitely many flavors to suit every palate.  The salsa bar is eclectic and amusing and brings a great point of conversation to the table.

This is a great addition to downtown Glendale.

I was disappointed by the slow service provided at both visits.  The staff plays music from an mp3/iPod but we had to ask several times to turn it down because we could not even here each other talk over the volume of the music.  It was a feature that I could have done without.  These are easy fixes for the management and staff."}
{"text":"We were in Arizona for five days, including Sedona and the Grand Canyon, and we ended up coming here twice.  Don't miss: salsa mexicana, tomatillo salsa, rice & beans, el pastor street taco, chicken mole street taco, and cochinita pibil street taco."}
{"text":"Best gourmet tacos around with really interesting flavors. Salsa bar is so good. I crave the pecan salsa!!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Asked 3x for tequila suggestions and got nothing.  People waiting out the door with 4 open tables.  Food is great just plan to wait.  AND I ordered a burro to go with FISH And was given beef.  Horrible!!   No mas!"}
{"text":"Heaven,  the way Mexican food should be! Dogfish tacos are the bomb! Salsa and guacamole are great too.  If you want true tacos this place is a must."}
{"text":"We were driving around starving and stopped here. Seems they are famous for salsa and tacos. It was really crowded. That's a good sign. The tacos were freshly made and good. The salsa was great. Wish I could take it home. We tried a variety of sauces and wanted to buy one of each. It was fun just taste testing. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Tried out this little place after trying their new location in Glendale. Man is this place small! There's limited parking up front and the whole restaurant can fit in my backyard. BUT the food is still as wonderful and delicious as ever! 

We arrived after going to Comicon and where immediately greeted and told the wait time. Once someone vacated a table, it was cleaned quickly for the next person. Our food came out at a reasonable time and so worth the wait! Our server was very friendly  and gave us some delicious suggestions. I would definitely come back! 

Just be careful where you park because during rush hour, you won't be able to get out easily."}
{"text":"My salsa prayers have been answered!! They have a ton of options for flavoring your chips, taco, or whatever delicious food you may be eating here. I tried their peanut salsa, jalapeño, chipotle, and all the others I could get my hands on. They each had their own distinct flavor and they are all uniquely amazing. I was so pleased to find a true delicious salsa bar on this side of town. 
I grew up with salsas from my mom and she makes some DELICIOUS salsas. These were all so good and up to par with my mamas. 

When we first got here, it was dead. But within 20 min, there was a big wait. We were lucky to have gotten there when we did. We were graciously greeted and served fresh hot chips! I ordered a coronarita and it was ok. Not the best but decent. A little too high priced for me at ten bucks. I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the quesadillas since they are deep fried. I ordered the vegetarian one. Oh my goodness. That was the most delicious quesadilla I have ever had in my life. I probably wouldn't call them quesadillas. They were more like gorditas. But either way, AMAZING. 

I look forward to coming back and tasting their tacos, tortas and burritos. And stuffing my face with more chips and twenty different Salsas. :-) can't wait!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a bit small, but the food is delicious and the salsa bar is always changing flavors."}
{"text":"This is NOW my fab taco spot. The portions given are more than any other place I usually go to. Their salad bar has so many salsas to choose from. Its so hard to think of something I didn't like. And the horchata is like no other, you'll definitely come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Go! It took me forever to get around to eating despite being just down the street from me, and boy do I regret that. The food here is amazing! It may seem pricey, but I promise you it is 1000% worth it! The portions are pretty big, I couldn't even finish my plate! (If you like them a little smaller though, go for a bowl.) I can't say enough for the quality or taste of the food. I have since recommended this to everyone I know. So don't hesitate, go!"}
{"text":"Awesome to see more gems like this on this area. Carne Asada is fantastic. Great selection of salsas and house margarita is the perfect stand by to cool things down. Only complaints are the wobbly tables, missing drink menu and absent children's selection"}
{"text":"An oustanding, quality restaurant with reasonable prices.  The carne asada bowl that I had was amazing.  Enough for two meals for me, but it was so good, I ate it all at one time.  I did take out and while waiting saw all of the dishes come out to the customers.  Everything looked amazing.  I can't wait to return and try some of the other items.  The salsa bar was amazing with over 12 choices of different salsa.  I mixed the guacamole (hot) and cilantro (mild)  salsa and it was one of the best that I have ever tried with the perfect level of spice for me.  You can't miss this place.  Thanks again for a great meal."}
{"text":"Hmmm ... well it was good, just not great. 

I had the shrimp taco and it came super hot but relativity tasteless. My girl Jacquid had the same thing (two shrimp tacos) and the total came to $25... not exactly a bargain in my book.

That said the interior is small but beautiful (lot of art on the walls)."}
{"text":"4 star food with 0 star service so I compromised. We walked in and questioned if anyone even worked there. We waited about 5 minutes before I had to walk over to the bartender and ask if it was self seating. I was told that they have to clear the tables which were full and that's why we weren't sitting yet. Thanks... I guess? So we finally sit and its 15 minutes before were asked what we want to drink and are given menus. About 10 minutes later the bar tender walks up and says \"I'm not your waiter but I'll help you\" the girl that was supposed to be our waiter was in her own world staring at the POS system like she was having problems creating people checks, but I think she just didn't want to face all the mad diners looking impatient around me. People that walked in 15-20 minutes after me are already getting Togo boxes and pretty much the same issue was present with the table next to us. We came in five minutes after him yet finished eating before he received his food. There was no order or massive issues in the kitchen or both. Even a walk up Togo order was in and out quickly, but the man was complaining about receiving the wrong food. The waitress seemed to argue back with customers or give excuses. It was very unacceptable customer service wise. I will never go back or recommend this place even though the food was good. Near the end of the meal we were told the food was great (which it was) but the service was horrible (also true) by a staff member. Why can't you fix it if you know it's wrong? If you order take out I would suggest the street tacos as they are all very good. If the restaurant isn't busy I'm sure the service doesn't struggle (as I've experienced the first time I went in) but when I returned on a date to careless and horrible service I know it's not worth my time to return."}
{"text":"Food was good, nothing to write home about. They have a ton of different salsas at their salsa bar, only about 3 are tasty & worth eating. However, their house margaritas are amazing. Staff is friendly. Only real complaint was their A/C was not cold enough which made it uncomfortably warm in the restaurant, especially when the temperature outside is 110+."}
{"text":"I'm from California and I would move across the street from this place. Fantastic tacos and salsa. The pork was great. My barbacoa was great. My chorizo was great. This is all you need to know."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I asked the cashier to order me her favorite thing and it was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the best food I've eaten in a long time. Eating a low carb diet can be difficult when eating out - especially at a taco place - but their menu offers a \"protein style\" option, where they wrap the taco filling in fried cheese. It was amazing! The tortilla soup was also incredible; I'll probably dream about it.  I'm super bummed I don't live in or near Phoenix, but that's probably good because I'd eat here daily."}
{"text":"I love going here for the gourmet tacos. They can be a little slow in service at times but that is because they are making things fresh. Their salsa bar is excellent with multiple salsas for every palette. I have brought many coworkers here for lunch and they love it too. I have yet to try their margaritas because I have only gone for lunch but they look amazing as well. I highly recommend the tiger shrimp, arrechetta (carne asada) and the tinga tacos."}
{"text":"What's most fascinating about La Santisima is that their three separate locations seem to vary greatly in reputation. There's the one in Downtown Glendale, which receives mostly positive reviews. There's one in Flagstaff, that strangely receives a lot of harsh criticism. And then there's this location, the flagship, which receives an exorbitant amount of Yelp reviews that are mostly positive, with the occasional one-star reviews complaining about their terrible customer service.

My feelings on Santisima have always been mixed. It's one of my girlfriend's favorite restaurants based on the quality of their guacamole, horchata, and rice and beans. Hell, they also make some pretty decent tacos to boot. But as many people have stated, Santisima is a primary example of a restaurant that's become incredibly popular, but has failed to adapt their model to accommodate the crowds.

Wait times are very common. Parking is horrid, there's hardly any room to wait inside, and rarely will you ever be greeted upon walking in. We usually have to hunt down a server in order to put our names on the list. What's also strange is that, you might see tons of empty tables inside that are unused, while crowds of people are waiting inside in order to get in. When we were dining there recently, a nearby couple finished up their food and left. Their table was left uncleaned for over an hour - all while a group of about a dozen people were waiting outside.

I've also learned that this isn't a restaurant where you want to spread out your portions. Order everything at once. Drinks, appetizers, and entrées. And as soon as they bring out the food, request the bill. If not, you'll be sitting around here for a long, long time.

Santisima's menu is kind of intimidating. They cover a lot of ground. Probably too much, in fact. I usually play it safe and just order some of their street tacos. They're good, but in the last few years with increased exposure to other options, I don't quite consider them to be as mind-blowingly amazing as some people are saying. Rice and beans are very good, however, with my girlfriend always citing how authentic the beans taste in comparison to that canned rubbish most people dish out.

Many people rave about the salsa bar, as if it's some kind of new, foreign invention that they've never seen before. Yes, people. There's a salsa bar. Any reputable taco place has one. Santisima might be considered a cut above the rest, however, because of the variety available.  

I ordered their traditional quesadilla on a whim, expecting the same thing I receive at practically every taco shop in Phoenix. Instead, I received a giant-sized, deep-fried quesadilla with oaxaca cheese and butter flavoring that's more on par with a gordita. I love the cheese, but the breading is a bit too chewy for my taste.

Their horchata is consistently referenced by many people as being one of the best you can find - provided that you're into chunks. The drink, which is far superior to the more commonly found pre-mixed rubbish, contains hearty cuts of strawberry, cantaloupe, and pecans. In my opinion, it definitely lives up to its reputation.

The place has a \"dive\" feel, similar to what you'd find at Barrio Café. Thankfully, they're a bit less arrogant about their prices - so the place seems more of an authentic establishment and less like a yuppie playground. However, watching clueless men unknowingly walk in and out of the \"Catrinas\" restroom always manages to generate some laughs. They've since added a \"Women\" sign above the door to stop this from happening.

The food at Santisima is very good - although I think my girlfriend is a bit more enthusiastic about it than I am. I don't quite see them as the five-star establishment that so many other people claim, but they're still worthy of a strong recommendation based on the food alone.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"Ooooh, more of a 4.5 rating.

So many wonderful things to say about this place. Thank goodness for living social deals that introduce me to new favorites!

Unassuming from outside. It is located in a run down strip mall with limited parking. But once you go through those doors you are transported to a dia de los muertos paradise. Really cool decor with awesome art on the walls. Love the bathroom doors!

Service was warm, informative, and attentive. 

Salsa bar. Wow, what can I say? I consider myself an expert on Mexican food, as a Mexican-American myself and a native of Arizona. But I have never seen these sort of salsas in my life! Peanut salsa? Strawberry salsa? Yum. 

My husband had the dogfish shark taco dinner and I had the veggie taco dinner. Yummmmm. Hubby loved his tacos and I had the BEST veggie tacos of my life. The cheese in the tacos is delicious. The beans and rice were great too. 

I had their house margarita which was so different and refreshing. It had a hint of grapefruit juice which I loved.

My only (very minor) complaints? They charge for chips. Only a couple bucks but I wish I was warned before I saw it on the receipt. 

Also, I saw a tiny bit of unidentifiable meat in my taco. It must have gotten mixed in accidentally on the grill. Hey, it happens, but it can really unnerve a vegetarian.

Love this place. We will definitely be back, preferably during happy hour when I can knock back a couple of their margaritas at a discounted price. :)"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to write this review until I was really inspired, because I wanted to do this place justice. 

Sitting at a coffee shop, a little wired, listening to some amazing Explosions in the Sky in my headphones, I finally feel I'm ready. 

The bad: North of McDowell. I mean, this place is supa close to me, so I'm happy, but I really wish this place had a sexy downtown location because it is so freaking good it would blow up if more people were near it. I feel the location, although keeps it a hidden gem, also repells people from going, although let me be the one to tell you, it shouldn't! You NEED to go here if you are chippy and salsa person. Bottom line. Not optional. The absolute BEST in Phoenix metro ever. If you disagree, hit me up and I will pay for your meal. I'm not kidding. I believe in it that much. 

The good: The Salsa bar. Jesus Christ himself would call this Salsa bar a miracle. From reds, to greens, to peanut, to hot, to mild, chunky and smooth they have everything, hand made from scratch and incredible. The flavors actually rotate so some times you'll go and get a new treat to try. Most of them are inspired by regions of the world and have salsa flares about them. I can't stop, thinking about it now. I may leave this coffee shop and go there for lunch today now... 

The gourmet tacos. Incredible, large chuncks of savor steak, giant shrimp (yah I know that makes no sense), and great corn tortillas make this no flour boy a very very happy camper. 

Obviously you'll need to choose the right salsa to add on top of your already incredibly delicious taco, but choose wisely. The flavors are already perfect. 

I hope this review has done it justice. It's incredible and needs to be in your rotation. Especially if like taking your friends out to new places they have never been before."}
{"text":"Wow.  This is a great spot.  After driving by two times, I finally parked near the party supply company and walked into La Santisima to find a small dining room full of satisfied customers...and a huge salsa bar!

Highlights include the Santisima taco with Oaxaca cheese, and the baja shrimp."}
{"text":"Terrific! We always take out of towners here to have a good experience with great food.
Even our Pennsylvania relatives that think taco bell is exotic have LOVED this place. And those of us that cringe at that comparison love La Santisima as well. The salsa bar has such a great variety of sauces that it alone is worth the trip. The horchata is decent (I've had far better) but every item I've tasted on the menu has been amazing. Pricey - but amazing. Worth the time and money!"}
{"text":"First .. $14 for one burrito (smh)

Second .. Had NO clue this place was featured on Food Network / DDD. 

Third .. Gave away the other half (more like 2/3) of my burrito n I hope this was just an off kitchen day

Sooooo being on Food Network elevated my expectations when I saw the sign inside after I ordered .. The salsa bar is definitely nice but means nothing if they're not all on point. I'd rather have 2-4 really good salsas vs 12-14 mediocre ones. Much better tacos, salsas/salsa bars out there (Ta'Carbon or Tacos Sahuaro) than here. The staff is friendly, the space is small but soon expanding I believe. The burro (La Santísima) w arrachera (carne asada) was disappointing; everythg just seemed muddled as far as flavor, it was one note. The spinach came through n the carne was nothing different than what u may find at filibertos. A return is still up in the air."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: After 1 1/2 hr wait we left without other food in our stomachs but chips with salsa!
Place was packed, 2 servers for the whole hungry crowd, our order got misplaced, and with two hungry kids next to me I had to leave to a nearby Subway. I do believe the food a the two sister facilities is great. But the service at this location is close to the worse I've ever experienced. I was happy when I got to know this place had been opened in Glendale, since we just moved to the West Valley, but unfortunately I'm not planning to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Horchata was really delicious. Had a bit different taste with strawberries, other fruit and pecans. The salsa bar was fun. We enjoyed the Mexican salsa and chipotle salsa. 

We got the three taco plate with al pastor and pork. The tacos weren't amazing. The other pork was better than al pastor for sure. We also tried the second burrito down on the menu, enchilada style. It was yummy. Would recommend that over the tacos any day."}
{"text":"As the name implies, it's an eatery that specialized in tacos and wide variety of salsas.  Among 5 of us, three ordered tacos and were pleased with the food, and two persons ordered the Quesa: La Condesa Mahi Mahi and Sonora Arrachera Quesa.  The quesa is like a jumbo empanada  made with corn flour dough then deep fried. We ordered it at the waitress recommendation.  I'm sure the soft corn flour dough makes it very hard to stay together during the frying process however the creation is way too doughy and heavy, with little filling. Nobody ordered burritos. If we come back again, I'd definitely recommend my friends/family to stay with the tacos."}
{"text":"La Santisima is wonderful, one of my favorite local Mexican spots. The menu is unique (not your standard taco and burrito place) and they are cognizant of both vegan and gluten-free diets. 

The best part is the salsa bar! They have several typical salsas, but they also have several unique salsas (strawberry is the best) and sampling each is part of the experience.

My favorite menu item are the quesas, it's like a fried corn quesadilla, but better. 

It gets busy during dinner time, so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"If you're in the area and are looking for a refreshing drink this place is a must. Literally the best horchata I've ever had!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco spots . Huge variety of tacos from shark to filet mignon. Love that they always have so many salsas to choose from . They have created a small but comfortable environment . Service is decent and the wait times are usually pretty long. Overall really good Mexican food would recommend ."}
{"text":"Mole sauce and strawberry salsa! Show up early or come ready to wait. I will definitely come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Was staying downtown Phoenix so grabbed hotel bike.. easy ride.  Once \"we\" figured where to lock the bike all was great. The decor is nothing fancy but for me that added to its credibility.  Staff was friendly n helpful w my menu Qs.  The chips were served w/o salsa as I was informed \"the 12 variety salsa bar is in next room, help yourself...\".  I order a burrito 1 of 3 the staff recommended.  I got thru half.  Food was hot n very flavorful.  Seemed a favorite of locals as guests were plentiful.  Went to another yelp Mexican establishment earlier in week n while it was fine, Santi's was excellent.  Still trying to see if have time to stop for a go meal on way to airport.   For this guy on a Thursday it was a 5* !!!  Well done."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on diners, drive-ins and dives and am so glad we stopped here! We are in town for 2 days from Miami, on our way to Sedona! Service is amazing, food is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! Great place! Horchata is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"How can I not like this place? It has my name written all over it!

I came here on a Saturday night to sample this popular gourmet taco shop. I stepped into the dark interior which had a Day of the Dead décor and filled with ten tables for hungry diners.

The menu is divided into five sections:

Gourmet Tacos or Gourmet Taquetzin
Street Tacos
Gourmet Burros or Cazuela Bowl 
Gourmet Corn - Quesadillas
Lonches

I ordered the Al Pastor Burro (spicy pork, salsa, pineapple, veggies) $9 and Daniel got the Tlaloc Vegan Burro (mesquite grilled cactus, caramelize onion, veggies and cheese) $9. Both of them did not have rice or beans inside (a.k.a. fillers) and still kept it hardy but not overstuffed. My Al Pastor had the spiciness and sweetness which you typically find but what made this burro special, was it was grilled on the top and bottom and the fillings were made from high quality ingredients. And for you cheese lovers, you won't find it inside but I'm sure you can request it. The burro was a healthy alternative and the cactus had a nice texture. My only complaint was it needed additional salsa to add to the flavor. Be warned ... take a Beano before this meal!

All meals came with a basket of tortilla chips and unlimited trips to the salsa bar which had at least ten different types of homemade salsa to experiment. Most of them had a kick of spice to it and you can pick from chunky vs. smooth salsas. My favorite was mixing the Salsa Mexicana and Avocado Salsa. Talk about double dippin'! The Salsa Chipotle was also another favorite for us.

Personally, the lighting was a little darker than I preferred during dinner. I wouldn't call it romantic but rather adventurous!

Since it was a busy night, the two servers were on their toes and the wait for the food was reasonable. They had an extensive cocktail list with many of the diners enjoying their margaritas and homemade horchatas. 

I hope to return to try the mole street tacos and say I ate at \"Santisima\"!"}
{"text":"The Guisados of Phoenix. 

Order the smoked Marlin tacos they are amazing. You will easily forget that you are eating fish. 

The salsa bar selection can be a bit overwhelming. You want to try everything but at the same time are afraid to because you don't want to make the wrong taco salsa combination. Ahh the paradox of choice. 

Horchata lovers will be enticed to order the house Horchata which goes for $3.99. The specialness of that drink all float on top in the form of pecans, diced cantaloupe, and strawberries. A girl walked in solely to order the Horchata to go."}
{"text":"My son recommended this place, I didn't know what to order, and asked the cashier for suggestions, he said they are well known with burrito and enchilada styles, we ordered a pork and steak, total is $40 for 2 burritos, If it tasted good then i would not mind to pay for the price, BUT It tasted bland, I could get more than 2 burritos and tasted 100% better than this,"}
{"text":"Great food and salsa bar. Personally, I love the strawberry, 7 chiles, & Mexicana salsa. I had the crane asada (ok) and Mayan Cochinita Pibil Tacos (very flavorful!) combo with rice (mixed with corn - soft and yummy!). My friend order the burro with beef and chimicuri sauce which was soooo delicious. Prices are reasonable $10/plate."}
{"text":"The guacamole and the salsa bar are enough to make you happy. The tacos were hit and miss."}
{"text":"I'm a taco snob. These tacos were fantastic! The quesadillas are unique - something between a quesadilla and a tamale - and also fantastic. All the food and salsas in the salsa bar were fresh, and the service was great. I wish they would open a restaurant in my home town."}
{"text":"Fantastic yelp recommendation! I took my husband here for lunch before we flew out of Phoenix. This place gets packed for lunch and it maybe hard to find a table! No place to just wait and hangout, unless you want to wait outside. But they turnover tables pretty quickly. Best thing about this place was the salsa bar--so many varieties. My favorite tacos were the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Tacos...hands down!"}
{"text":"This is a place where the hype exceeds the capability of the restaurant. 

There's nothing wrong with this place. It's just not exceptional, great or even noteworthy. 

When you throw in their exorbitant prices of 3.99 for a single taco, you realize that you're getting hosed. 

The salsa bar itself is good. The serving cups are too small so as to adequately support the dipping of the chip. Speaking of which, the chips are too thin and cold. 

The food itself is good quality. The shark taco was crunchy and tasty, the pork shoulder taco interesting and flavorful. Sadly neither was worth the 4 buck price."}
{"text":"Bomb.com
You're missing out if you don't eat here. Best taco I've had. Big portions and to die for salsa bar. I still think about these tacos, would definitely come back here if I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Overall great food with a good selection of items. Both tacos I ordered were very good and extremely fresh. The chips were good and the salsa bar was the best I have seen. 
I would for sure go back and recommend this place to anyone having a taco craving. 
The only negative and reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was that parking was not good and it is a little hard to locate, even though it is right on 16th street.  
Again, overall great food with reasonable prices and makes for a great lunch."}
{"text":"Excellente! The food is amazing, the salsa bar rocks and the service is nice. This is the place to go on 16th Street. Hopefully it's awesomeness and popularity don't ruin it..."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy; but tasty tacos. Salsa bar had many choices I have not experienced before. My $5 mango margarita was ok; didn't taste
like mango to me."}
{"text":"Yet another eatery I've put off trying for way too long! With a name that doesn't dissapoint this gourmet taco shop is appealing on the outside, and warm and welcoming on the inside. Seating is tight and scarce, so arrive early and be prepared to make new friends. My favorite part about this place aside from the food, is the salsa bar... who knew that many salsas even existed? I ordered the El Gaucho burro, packed full of marinated steak, then topped with avocado, cucumber, and chimichurri sauce which gave the burrito a crisp flavor. I then proceeded to drench it in chipotle salsa from the salsa bar! The horchata here is to die for, made fresh and topped with walnuts and sliced fruit! For the price, you'll be hardpressed to find an authentic Mexican meal this good anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I really like this little place. Great bean & cheese burrito, good molé.  
Salsa bar - exceptional. 

The missing star is due to service. Everyone is really nice, but they just need more staff."}
{"text":"La Santisima is a taco oriented Mexican restaurant located in a blue collar neighborhood of Phoenix, which offers an impressive happy hour menu and a delicious variety of tacos.

I ate dinner at La Santisima on a Thursday. I arrived around five and was seated quickly. I did not receive any service quickly though. The restaurant was clearly understaffed. It took a long time to get a drink, a bowl of chips, and my ultimately my check. It was never clear who my server was either.

The food was excellent, but the service was overwhelmed. I would try La Santisima again, but hopefully the service will be better next time."}
{"text":"Outstanding food.  Very creative and unique ingredients.  Worth the hype.  Would prefer if they had table service during lunch."}
{"text":"Two things you must have: the Cabo shrimp tacos, and the cilantro \"salsa\" (it's at the salsa bar, but it's dairy-based, creamy, and delicious). I went with a vegan and even they found something to eat that was reaaaaally good (vegetable burrito). Some of the salsas were really spicy, but all of them were awesome. Decor is great (chairs are a little heavy and make a crapton of noise if you move them, but I don't really think that's a dealbreaker, come on now), and yes, it's in a bad area (really guys, let's keep posting about locking our cars. Shouldn't you do that everywhere anyway? Most of the people I know who have had their cars stolen had them stolen from outside their houses, or at work, in BETTER neighborhoods than this. Get. Over. It), but overall it was fantastic, servers were attentive and very nice, and the food was YUM and at a good price."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Everything tasted fresh, service was great and tons of salsas to choose from. This is my go to spot when I'm near downtown!"}
{"text":"Whenever we travel anywhere I use the \"TV Foods\" app and then cross check places on Yelp to find great places to eat. Well, this place was awesome!!! It's a small neighborhood like place with great food. They have a salsa bar with about 20 kinds to try. My favorites were the mango/strawberry one and a orange colored pecan one (had a nice kick). My wife and I both got gourmet tacos. I can't remember what all ones I had but all were great. Favorite was the battered shrimp one (top left option on that page of menu). The Horchata was the best one I've ever had (so said many others on their reviews). Had real fruit and pecans in it. Must go to this place!!!! We will go again."}
{"text":"Authentic. Original. And a salsa bar that has flavors that put all others to shame. 

Parking is limited and the neighborhood is not the best. Come for lunch on a weekday."}
{"text":"Over hyped I think. To me the tacos actually lacked flavor. Had a combo of 3 different types and thought they were all somewhat bland and lacked real creativity. Basically its taco truck food (not a bad thing) at probably triple the price (a bad thing). Now the salsa bar is awesome and this is where this place shines. Lots of unique flavors and it is clean and well presented. The chef/cook came out to check on orders so i think they care but the price does not justify the food...."}
{"text":"Tacos and salsas were good, but the quesadilla we were not fans of.  It was too bland and the deep fried corn shell wasn't that good."}
{"text":"I've never eaten anything at La Santissima that wasn't delicious, and the portions are moderate to large. The salsa bar has some great choices and unique flavors. The prices are very reasonable. If you go early, the wait isn't so bad, but the service once you're seated could be better."}
{"text":"Aargh - the two reasons I come are the two reasons I can't give this place what could be it's due worth.  I came specifically to try their salsas and their horchata.  Unfortunately I never really got to try either b/c they had run out pretty much out of all of it.  Probably a good sign that they are busy and popular but at the same time, a big disappointment.  I tried their two taco plate.  The cochinita pibil and veggie tacos.  Both were ok.  The beans were ok but not nearly as good as America's homemade beans.  The rice was like everyone said - not your typical mexican rice.  Not bad though.  Apparently they were so busy they could barely keep up with \"supply\".  The salsa bar was pretty dismal.  They had just a little of the cilantro and peanut one.  Horchata was all out.   I'm disappointed that I missed out but at least it's a good sign that they are the place to go.  Will definitely be back to hopefully try again.

TIP: If you are coming at night, be very careful.  It was really dark and there weren't any real lighted signs.  I could barely see it so it's easy to pass it."}
{"text":"This is a solid dive place. Great tacos. Great food all around. Service was good. 

I tried 5 of the gourmet tacos. All were good.  The place is a little dirty, walls and windows but that almost adds to the place. I'll be back for sure. 

The salsa bar is nice. Too many to try on one visit. I like this place."}
{"text":"so lucky to have this place in my neighborhood

amazing menu, helpful staff, salsa variety is the best in phx"}
{"text":"Regional Mexican at it's best, with something for everyone, from street tacos to mole. 

Salsa bar has an overwhelming selection of thoughtful and unconventional sauces. Pecan, peanut, sesame, and strawberry to name a few. 

I enjoyed cilantro, avocado, and salsa mexicana. 

Shrimp mole with TOASTED (amazing) cheese for main dish, accompanied by a house margarita. 

Only drawbacks were hours (close at 8) and dimly lit parking around the back. 

The staff was attentive and the music was good - come for an early dinner / late lunch!"}
{"text":"Fond memories here at La Santisima. Every single time I come here for their La Santisima veggie taco plate, it feels like a great life decision. These tacos are heavenly with fresh sautéed mushrooms, spinach, zucchini and onions with melted cheese. Then there is the salsa bar with around a dozen house made salsas. They best is the Mexican salsa and the pecan salsa crema. Oh and can't forget about their massive horchata drink they serve with chopped nuts and fruit on top. For those who partake, they have a bar with several tequilas, and probably other things. Small place, but cozy and intimate. Good spot for a casual date night where you can be a cool Phoenician that knows of the perfect spot for dinner. Parking is on 16th street, kind of a weird diagonal situation where you hope you don't get side swiped by traffic... But hey. Totally worth it if you do. These tacos. Yum."}
{"text":"Dear Condesa,
I wish you had a few more vegetarian items, and that you didn't get all persnickety and confusing about the whole torta/lonche thing, because that led me into an ordering error. However, bygones. While I didn't love my veggie lonche, it was obviously very fresh and prepared with care. Also, please refill the salsa bar more frequently so that I won't be tempted to get too much of the really spicy ones and burn the he** out of my mouth. And put more tequila in the (non-happy hour) margaritas. Thank you!
Amalia C.
P.S. Your chairs are too heavy.
P.P.S. In reflection, maybe this was more of a 2-star for me personally but my husband really liked his street al pastor and carne asada taco plato and again, it all seemed fresh. So I bumped you up. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"Really delicious tacos, and the salsa bar as about a dozen varieties, all unique and tasty (including strawberry?! Trust me--just try it)... This is a mainstay in the neighborhood for a reason."}
{"text":"Super slow service.  Make sure you don't get the ques and get the burros instead.  We waited for over 30 mins for the food and they messed up one order.  That's a long time for mexican food."}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed in such a highly rated restaurant. The service and the food was under par, by far. The queso cheese dip is NOT dip, rather just semi-melted shredded cheese burnt onto a plate (for $8). It literally took 15 min for us to get a Dixie size cups of water. Our server 'Ambar' didn't know anything about the restaurant nor how to serve. I asked about margarita specials and she literally said \"idk, Thursday's we have specials but idk about today.\" After finally bringing us our food and water, I asked for silverware and she told me \"they're inside by the salsa bar.\" I've never been to a restaurant where you have to go get your own silverware. The food was under seasoned and chewy. Finally I asked for the manager and Ambar said \"she doesn't speak english.\" I am a server too and I realize every place has bad days, but this experience was unacceptable and I will never be back."}
{"text":"Let me start by raving about the salsa bar!!!!  OMG!!!!  Pecan Salsa, strawberry salsa, YUM!  I had their La Condesa veggie taco...it was delicious.  And we got there around happy hour, so, the cervezas were only $2!  Everything about this place was great...food, drinks, prices, decor.  I'm giving them 4 starts because even though they only had one other couple there, the service was slow!  Speed it up...and you will earn 5 stars!!!  Please don't change the menu.  This is truly gourmet mexican food with a twist.  Gracias!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend over here after work one night on a recommendation. I loved my food it was much bigger than I thought and more gourmet to. I was expecting a little cheese crisp filled with meat, but it was so much more than that. I had a margarita that was really good but I think it was grapefruit all it says on the menu is margarita's but no description of any of them.

The place was very tiny and cramped, but it was colorful in a good way and was not super busy. The service was a little slow and it was our first time so it took a while before they told us you get your sauce's from the little bar.

I will be back in the future, overall it was a good price and taste food."}
{"text":"Fun little restUrant! I like the food. Nice salsa bar!! Try the quesa!!!! I love the arrecha with pabolano peppers!!!!"}
{"text":"The salsas in the salsa bar are uncommon and exciting, but satisfying, without filling you up. This is great way to start the meal.

There are many favorite tacos of mine at this place. Cochinita Pibil is a must.

Beer-battered seafood tacos, whatever the kind, are always a success.

Whether you drink booze or not, you will be happy beverage-wise (Horchata with fruit/nuts! Strong Margaritas!)

Go there!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!! They have an awesome salsa bar, my favorite was the mexican salsa, it had a nice little kick to it.
The waiter's are so kind and had awesome service. I got the 3 taco plate which comes with rice and beans. And i am not really a bean liking person, but something about their beans had me eating them till gone. Their rice was unique too!! 
I totally see myself coming here again"}
{"text":"It's simply delicious, especially if you want a meal. The chips and salsa were delicious and varied from peanut to salsa roja. I recommend Sopa Azteca it has a quick and you can taste the flavors of the broth, the Oaxaca cheese and chip strips topped off with avocado slices. The fish tacos are amazing, as they have a real Baja flavor; topped with mayo, beer battered fish! My fiancé ordered the Sonoran carne azada burrito. The horchata was served with pecans and strawberries (you can opt out of strawberries). The portions were great and therefore we didn't order dessert. Yes the wait is long, however they are waiting on the state to approve a new line of cooks(?) But trust me, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have to say I think this place is over rated.  It's good but I wouldn't say top ten.  If you aren't from the Southwest u won't know the difference tho and it will be a great place."}
{"text":"The menu has lots of variety. As does the salsa bar. I got the street tacos, brisket, al pastor and chicken tinga. All were good. Next time I'll try a burrito. My coworker got a burrito and could only finish half."}
{"text":"Literally,  the BEST burrito we have ever had! The La Santisima burrito with chicken was absolutely incredible. You come for the food, not the service. They are a little slow, but the food is great! Completely worth it ! 

The mushroom quesadilla was also great! 

Small restaurant,  self serve salsa bar. 

10 tables and a bar. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great mexican place with some amazingly good tasting tacos. love their salsa bar. Love the new expansion they did, as it helped with the wait times. decor is a bit esoteric, but the food is great. can be a bit slow when busy, but worth the wait. Was visiting from Seattle and would surely stop again when in the area. very close to the airport."}
{"text":"The BEST in Phoenix:
Fish tacos (beer battered with cream sauce)
Horchata (contains fresh fruit and pecans, yum!)
Salsa bar (includes peanut and strawberry salsas)

The owner is this cute little lady who is always very nice"}
{"text":"I've been here many times. It is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona in my opinion.  

PROS: Delicious, authentic food, fresh ingredients, unique menu options, amazing salsa bar, perhaps the best Horchata in the state, delicious margaritas (and I usually don't like margaritas), good portion sizes for the price, nice atmosphere with the rustic bar, Mexican art, and light background music.

CONS: The place is very small and definitely gets crowded because the food is so good. When it is busy, the staff have a hard time keeping up so service can be slow and you may even feel like you are being ignored. Parking is the worst.

OVERALL: One of my absolute favorite restaurants. It's a great place to take a friend or someone visiting in town who wants a taste of authentic Mexican food and a high quality restaurant that Phoenix offers."}
{"text":"I come to La Condesa quite often (at least once a month) because it's really close to my house. It's one of those hidden gems along 16th Street and I really wish I could give it five stars but I just can't. Here's my summary of the place:

Good:
-The tacos are delicious! My favorite is the Mayan Pibil taco. 
-The prices are pretty descent.
-The salsa bar is AMAZING! I can't get enough of the pecan salsa. 
-The chips are free and they go fast with such great salsa selections.
-The margaritas are tasty.

Bad:
-The service is really bad. I'm not they type of customer to really care too much about service at a restaurant but it's pretty ridiculous here. I took my bf here the other day and it took about 8 minutes before anyone came to the table to greet us. I would say this was a fluke but, unfortunately, it's happened a few times now. Also, I have had two occasions when they forgot to bring out silverware/napkins. I've had a couple times when they've forgotten to bring out my margarita (they're really good here btw) and one time when they brought it out looking like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for 10 minues (all of the ice was melted). It's really sad how bad the services is because I absolutely LOVE the food/atmosphere.

I guess the bottom line is that La Condesa makes some amazing gourmet tacos and salsa but they fall very short on the service. I'll be back but there are plenty of other places I can go and receive great food AND great service (i.e. Gallo Blanco at the Clarendon Hotel)."}
{"text":"VERY small, parking sucks, good food. Nice variety of salsas.
*Don't come on your lunch hour unless you are an executive lunch."}
{"text":"If you don't get the horchata then you are making the biggest mistake of your life.... 

There are something's in life where you overlook the bad because the good outweighs it. Not gonna lie, the location and atmosphere is maybe a 3/5. But Dan says good tacos are always in the most ghetto areas so we had high hopes. The place was full when we arrived and filled with an assortment of people. It was promising. 

This place did not disappoint. I had the sorano arrachero taco plate (or whatever... Something like that) and Dan got the carne asada street tacos. Right when I bit into it I knew..... This was going to be a good meal. Dan is a taco snob and gave the street tacos 10 stars. Very rare. 

My tacos made me forget that our table was wobbly and that it was hard to find this place at night.

Just go and eat the tacos.... Just do it. 


Food 5/5 
Atmosphere 4/5 
Overall 5/5"}
{"text":"The salsas are so original and delicious, not to mention the delicious food. Also gluten friendly. :-)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, phenomenal service and fantastic food. I ordered the baja shark tacos and cabo shrimp tacos. Fresh and very delicious to say the least. A MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon and we were starving. We saw the gourmet taco sign so we discussed quickly and did u uturn because curiosity set in.  The place looked like a sticky dive but it was packed and we had to wait 15 minutes which was a sign of YUUMY food so we waited! 

See pictures of  what we ordered.

I love the cucumber in my burrito which you made for a unique taste compare to the normal burrito you get everywhere. I order side of red sauce which was also had an amazing consistency and taste. My guest order ed a shrimp taco which was also yummy. She loved every byte of it (her exact words) so much she had it done before I could eat half my burrito.

Our server Joe was also very pleasant and I enjoyed leaving a nice tip.

Going back for sure!"}
{"text":"The salsa bar is delicious and surprising, the place was crowded but service is fast. Plenty of chips to try all the different salsas and the prices are sweet!"}
{"text":"Over priced for the food.  I got burro stuff with rice and beans very little meat.  Nothing nice about bitting into a fatty piece of meat. For the price you would think have decent amount of meat.  My husband mexi burro which cost 21.98 enchilada style! Only 4 piece of meat in the burro.  I enjoy horchata I have to say."}
{"text":"First of all, salsa bar is HUGE. So many different types from pico de gallo to spicy chipotle to strawberry salsa. They have at least 10 different types. 

The food was really great! I got the al pastor street tacos plate and the tacos were amazing. The beans were also surprisingly really great as well. The tacos had the perfect amount of sauce, salsa, and spiciness. 

The service here is also really great. It's a small place so the service is very fast. We got seated right away and got chips and drinks out within a couple minutes. The location is a little weird, and it doesn't look like much from the outside but the inside is very well decorated and put together. All in all very nice place, and I would highly recommend to anyone in the Phoenix area! I wish they had one in Tucson as well. If they did I'd be there all the time!"}
{"text":"Si! Si! Si! Dieciseis salsas. Tacos sabrosos. El pibil? Increible. Los mejores tacos este lado de la frontera."}
{"text":"Salsa bar is so great, so many selections. Only issue is that if you come towards the end of lunch a lot is empty and both times I've been here I haven't been able to find someone to refill. But the food is really really good and while the prices are a little high, the quality of the food reflects this."}
{"text":"Great food, ambience and service! Can't go wrong with the Al pastor."}
{"text":"Al pastor burrito for the win!!! love the pecan salsa!"}
{"text":"If you have an interest in the best tacos in the state, then stop playing games and come to this place. not fancy, not cheap, but worth the time and money. these guys are the real deal"}
{"text":"Al Pastor street tacos are where its at!!  Solid margaritas.  Hole in the wall place with a good vibe."}
{"text":"Simply my favorite tacos in Maricopa County. We've sampled several different types and they all were amazing! Great for lunch and we got quick service. They also took our large family group even though the space is limited. You should go."}
{"text":"The horchata is worth the trip alone.
I prefer the central location but this one works for the west side. 
Salsa bar is good - nice roasted chili flavor in the green salsa. 
I like the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst Mexican experiences I've had thus far. I hate to say it but I will most likely never come back. I ordered a steak burrito and it tasted like dog food. My friends ordered soft tacos and they were not a fan of their meals either. By the looks of other reviews this place is supposed to be amazing. I would like to give it another shot but I felt sick to my stomach walking out of there after eating and that's saying a lot because I love all types of food. The only reason this is getting 2 stars is because the chips and salsa bar was bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, Really bad service!  Best recommendation order to go! 
BTW they charge you the extra chips!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The decorations are authentic and neat and the food is delicious. They have a HUGE selection of salsas, I enjoyed their guacamole and peanut salsa. My boyfriend and I ordered yummy Mexican Coke in the bottle, our favorite. I ordered two of their carne asada tacos with pickled onions and chimichurri sauce which came with rice and beans with fresh cheese on top, it was fantastic. My boyfriend got the bullet burro which he absolutely loved. We'll definitely be coming back to try more of their salsas!"}
{"text":"Answer the phone. We try repeatedly on several several occasions to phone in an order. Yes we understand the order will take an hour, we account for that but ANSWER the phone. Good gracious how rude and unprofessional, you don't answer the phone because you don't want the business. I've heard you mumble this when I've been here. Disgrace for my neighborhood taco shop. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED. Ridiculous 

Update. 7/7/2107
AGAIN and AGAIN
No one answers the phone. You think a recording will pass for not answering. You give your neighborhood a BAD name because you can't properly staff your restaurant. Oh and today's recording says \"Happy 4th of July\", 3 days later."}
{"text":"5 stars because every time I have been here I have not been disappointed! We always come here after picking up/dropping off at the airport since its ohh ~9 minutes away! Really great spot too if you're coming for lunch. Service is really fast. 

Food taste delicious. Salsa bar is huge! 
Huge fan of the el gaucho and the la santiama tacos. The mahi mahi here is also beyond delicious. I've always found that 2 tacos al la carte is perfectly fulfilling but my brother loves their burritos!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in Phoenix.   Very tasty. I grew up in Tucson  where Mexican is great on every corner. The salsa bar is excellent. The chips were ok. I will return for sure."}
{"text":"Been here a total of 4 times and I want to make it my 5th as soon as I can. So this was easy for me to update my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars!  I still love my tacos but my wife recently had the argentine steak quesadilla and it was amazing!! It was very big..big enough for us to easily share. On our last visit we didn't share but ended up taking the other half home and have an amazing snack!

Overall service isn't the fastest, but I'll wait a little for food so good. Nice local restaurant in Glendale!"}
{"text":"Let's eat Mexican. Great place, will come back!"}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is simple but delicious. Only reason I'm not giving this a 5 star is the salsa ramekin are way too small, but so good ;) !"}
{"text":"Best Hispanic food in phoenix by far. Service is on point. Although there is this one male server that always seems to be in a bad mood. Owner is always nice though. Wide variety of sauces. Chips server before dinner was delicious."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! The tacos were fantastic! The salsa was great too. It is a very nice hole in the wall with fab food. 

Special mention goes to the steak verde taco-phenomenal! 

As stated before the service is ok, the neighborhood is rough but the food makes up for it. I'm just not sure id come here after dark."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled on this place about a year ago after reading about it in the now defunct Calendar Section of the Arizona Republic.  We have been in love ever since.  I want to try a burro or something else so bad but I cannot tear myself away from the Tacos like a few other Yelpers have experienced, addiction, in a good way.  My husband ordered a quesadilla one time and it was delicious but I need my tacos, the shrimp ones are my faves with the chicken mole coming in second.  Vanessa (I assume this is her name from other reviews) has one of the prettiest smiles I have ever seen!  There must be a hidden Wizard at this Oz- like place, I have not ever seen anyone else except \"Vanessa\".  Whom ever is behind the curtain is a culinary genius in my book."}
{"text":"THE BEST salsa bar in AZ. Amazing everything else, but the salsa bar alone is worth the price of admission.

Expansive menu, the kind that normally would be cause for concern. Yet, everything on it comes out perfect. 

I love the fried shrimp tacos and the carne sandwich thing [I forget what they call it now but it's NOT a torta]

The horchata is diabetes in a glass and absolutely worth it [share with a friend, or bring your insulin]"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. Truly ruined my Sunday night dinner. Waited for someone to seat us and nothing. Then we asked to be seated and then waited 14 minutes! When I lost my patience and went to a server and had to ask for service! Unbelievable! Meanwhile the 2 servers were taking their time doing in urgent things like cleaning table instead of attending customers. So disgusted. I will contacting the owner and possibly the health dept!!!"}
{"text":"Gourmet Tacos at it's best!  The lovely lady behind the counter was the owner that served us. My friend John and I decided to check this out this evening, and all I can say is it's the bomb! I ordered the deep-fried shrimp quesadilla with ooey-gooey cheese! ( I know it sounds unhealthy, but I had to have it) It was enormous and succulent!   John and I both had the pecan horchata, and it did not disappoint.  We went there around 8:00 pm when it's slow, so our service was stellar. They have a lot of great sounding items on their menu, so I am looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Excellent salsa bar. There were 14-18 salsas to try. Our favorites were peanut, tomatillo, peppers and onions, roasted red pepper, cilantro. 

I enjoyed the La Santisima Burro with mahi mahi. The salsas were an excellent accompaniment to the burro. 

We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Good Mexican Food,  Long wait but worth it."}
{"text":"This place has become one of my new favorites! On the list of must tries are: fish tacos, salsa bar, and the Horchata (probably the best I've had). This restaurant is small, so if you're coming in a group you will most likely have to wait to get a table. I usually just sit at the bar, order a couple of tacos/rice/beans and then I'm out. Service can be slow at times, but the food always comes out tasty."}
{"text":"We got there...there was a wait...it was so crowded that some people had to stand to eat their food and it was soooo damn worth it.

From the folk Mexican art depicting Santo and Freda Kahlo's uni-brow to the leather and rough wood La Condesa is as much a treat to the eyes as to the nose and mouth.

We are so used to fiery Tex-Mex here in Arizona that it is hard to believe that there is another side to good Mexican food....a delicacy of flavor that counts on subtle textures and refreshing herbs and vegetables to cool our palates and the heat of Southwest days.

I tried every one of the salsas available on Saturday and I can still taste the peanut salsa while I dream of the strawberry salsa (and the cilantro cream salsa and the chipotle...you get the picture).

We split the dogfish and carne asada tacos along with a mahi burrito and were too stuffed to make our way any farther down the menu, guaranteeing we'll be back for more.

Any complaints? Only the smallest of one....I actually prefer water to soft drinks with my meals and appreciate a reasonably sized cup (I promise I won't steal the Coke). I was given an 8oz styro cup filled with ice, necessitating several trips to the counter to ask for more. Totally rediculous since the soft drink dispenser is behind the counter and I couldn't rip them off if I wanted to ;-) ....and yet another styro cup waiting over a thousand years to biodegrade in a landfill.

La Condesa is what a good taqueria should be, just make sure to weedle a paper cup out of the cashier if you quieres agua."}
{"text":"I had to update my review because they have updated their food and service, and they are now back on my list of favorite Mexican restaurants. If you're willing to venture to the vegetarian side the cauliflower tacos are outstanding! Plus the horchata and salsa bar are just as good as Day 1."}
{"text":"If you are a serious taco fan. This is your spot. There's always a wait but that's a good sign. Salsa bar is a highlight too. Cute place & great service. Only downside is that it's in kind of a sketchy neighborhood. Don't let that hold you back though."}
{"text":"This place was a 3 until I ate there again this week....and subsequently had one of the best quesadilla's EVER! I had previously only eaten the cochinita taco which is good, but not out of this world. From now on everything I eat at this place will be in \"quesa\" form... 

This was unlike any quesadilla I've ever had. The tortilla was thick and crunchy and soft all at the same time and had a taste of sweetness to it. Oh man, Delicioso! The chicken tinga was a perfect compliment as well. 

The salsa bar is kind of BS, as there are only a couple of salsas worth your time. The peanut salsa? Give me a break, terrible! But the mexicana salsa is one of the greatest things ever. 

This is a \"fine dining\" type Mexican place that will knock your socks off and run you about 10 bucks. Check it out if you're in the area, it is definitely worth your time!"}
{"text":"Very, very good \"real\" Mexican restaurant. This is not in the high-income part of Phoenix, but certainly the area is safe. The restaurant is positioned between a piñata shop & an empty store, but you cannot miss the signage! Everything that our group of five ordered was excellent. I had the chicken quesadilla; it was not like any other quesadilla I have ever had, with the shell a unique experience. Great place for informal dining with a different version of Mexican food."}
{"text":"Excellent menu, chefs, and service ..... just a bit inconsistent sometimes especially at the Glendale store."}
{"text":"This was my second time in and it seems to be pretty authentic. I like the impressive salsa bar as well as the chips. The first time in I tried the tiger shrimp, white fish, and steak street tacos and the second time I had the green chili pork burrito. The shrimp had a bit too much breading on it for me, the fish was fine, the steak was my favorite. The green chili pork burrito was good but not the best I have had by far. My husband tried the al pastor, carne asada, and steak tacos and enjoyed his but was not overwhelmed. The drinks are decent size but overall the food and drinks are pretty pricey. With so many good Mexican restaurants in Central Phoenix, La Santisma would not be my top choice but it would be a good place to bring an out of town guest looking for some authentic Mexican flavors."}
{"text":"Have only been there once but we were impressed. The flavors were rich and delicious and the dishes unique. Looking forward to trying it again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Great choice of salsas. Good service.  Can get crowded because it's not the biggest place, but honestly it's not usually a problem to get a table right away if you go right after work and get there between 5-6 p.m., plus then you can take advantage of happy hour. Woot!"}
{"text":"This place is really cool and unique. First the salsa bar is insane with like 12 different salsas. From sweet to mild to hot. The food is amazing I told the server that whatever they would order is what I want. I got this quesadilla empanada thing that was out of this world. Very small restaurant and the bar is like 3 seats but loved it."}
{"text":"We waited way too long to check this place out!  I had the Baja Shrimp taco and Fish Taco with rice and beans..... all delicious!   Wifey got the Maztalan taco and we enjoyed sampling almost everything the salsa bar...something for everyone. Will be back soon to try some more!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Shrimp tacos I've ever had. Beer battered, everything made fresh. Great authentic Mexican vibe, lot's of Dia De Los Muertos related art throughout. An extensive salsa bar with many clever flavors, many more than most places. Cilantro lime cream sauce, pecan salsa, seven pepper salsa... etc. You get the picture. This place deserves all the hype. Really nice service, very original ideas and flavors like you will taste no where else. Go check this place out for yourself. I personally will now be a regular here."}
{"text":"First time here and it was very good!  The many different salsas at the salsa bar are very good.  My husband had their version of a \"torta\" I would recommend sticking with the tacos. The steak and white fish tacos are amazing!  

Only bad thing is it not very big and tables are close to each other.  Service was slow but the food made up for that. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I got the Argentinian steak burrito and it was really good. The tortilla chips weren't anything special, but I liked the salsa bar. As another reviewer noted, there was a strong smell of sewage coming from the back room which was a turn off. Hopefully they get that fixed."}
{"text":"The Salsa bar is really cool but the food is just OK.  I would recommend going for a snack(chips and salsa) and a couple beers, not dinner."}
{"text":"Is it bad to say the best thing about the restaurant is their Chips & Salsa? Well it's true. The restaurant has a huge salsa bar with about 15 options for salsa; granted I'm a lover of condiments. The actual food I ordered didn't WOW me in the slightest but the chips and salsa are something to write home about! Service was Ok, could be better. I say it's worth a visit so you can judge for yourselves, have some chips and salsa and a nice cold beer at the minimum. ;)"}
{"text":"After driving much of the day from being in Grand Canyon and Sedona, our last stop was Phoenix. We were STARVING and tired so we chose this place to eat because of their \"reviews\". I am sure they have delicious authentic Mexican food but unfortunately we couldn't try it because when we walked in at 9:30pm on Thursday a hostess or who knows who quickly rushed over to us. I thought for a split second she was rushing to greet us instead she said that they were closed ? Google and yelp said they are open until 10pm not to mention their OPEN Sign was on and lighted. She said they close at 9 but their restaurant had customers in there. The worst part was when I walked out I was taking this picture that I have attached and that same girl who ousted us saying they were \"closed\" came outside and said actually we are open you can come in haha no thanks !"}
{"text":"I have been there three times. They have a really interesting menu and a nice salsa bar. Unfortunately, they don't have great service and their food is hit and miss. I had some of the best tacos ever during one visit, but the two subsequent visits were less that good."}
{"text":"Cant believe all the rave reviews on here! If you like to eat dry, chewy tasteless meat in your tacos....this place is for you. If you like to eat with plastic utensils in a dirty restaurant and pay $3 for a coke....this is for you.
If you like grimy walls, dirty floors and a salsa bar with half the choices empty....go for it. The meat in the street tacos were overcooked, chewy and tasteless. The taco meal for $9 came with 2 small tacos, and a thimble full of beans and a similar amount of rice. On a piece of paper in a plastic tray. You have to get your own plastic utensils and napkins...which I dont mind, just not at these prices. The famous salsa bar was half empty and I had to ask for forks as they had run out.
Poor, very poor. Dont waste your money."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for tacos as I have many options as a pescatarian. I have tried the wild white fish, shrimp, and vegeatarian tacos but I noticed they now have a smoked Merlin taco I can't wait to try! The best thing about this spot are the salsas; they are fresh, unique, and so addictive! I love the nopalitos salsa, with red onions, champignon, jalapenos, and cilantro that I can almost eat by itself with a fork. The only thing I don't recommended is the bean and cheese burrito as it is impossible to eat without it ooozing all over the place."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow and the food was good but nothing out of this world I expected more after seeing the show on diners drives and dives. Maybe I didn't order the right thing but compared to my wife's cooking I would rather eat her Mexican food rather than go there again. Maybe if I'm in the area I'll give it another shot but I'm definitely not going out of my way to go there the only thing that was excellent and off the charts was the decorating very awesome"}
{"text":"Everything I've had there has been amazing. The Veggie Burro is my favorite. The salsa bar kicks butt and the horchata is the best in town."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp I discovered this Amazing  Taco gem on the way to a meeting down town. 
La Condesa has a great salsa bar. The margaritas are tasty too!
Love the selection of tacos on the menu. 
The tacos were so delicious that when I started eating, I texted my husband to go there on his way home from work. Luckily he made it there before I had to take off to my meeting, and agrees, the food is amazing. 
The carnitas is my favorite. 
I cannot wait  to go again."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great atmosphere. Salsa bar is really good. Horchata is a must try. Very well priced. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is our new go-to restaurant for Mexican food. Our group tried 4 of their meals.. We were planning to use the salsa bar for the food we ordered but everything had so much unique flavor that there was no need to add anything else. This is not your typical American version of Mexican food. Everything is fresh, nothing was greasy. We loved it!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner because of the great reviews and awards. Maybe we caught them on an off night but the food was cold and the pork taco was so tough you could barely chew it. The service was also slow and sporadic. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"If \"10\" were an option, I would have picked that as a rating. This place was off the charts!  Highly recommend the Spicy Margarita. Oh, and bring an appetite."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday 5-ish for an early dinner with my friends. The place is cute, few tables, it's got a bar and 2 bathrooms. Salsa bar was awesome! There's tons to choose from.. My favorite was the salsa picante, jicama and the cilantro.. Ahhh soo good. I got the fried fish taco plate, the shark taco on the side and I also tried their horchata! The tacos were great! I love the rice it's got flavor to it and the horchata was very delicious! It's got fruit, cinnamon and nuts on top. Ok, so I didn't know it was big! I think the cup was 32oz, it's good for 2-3 people!!! The down side was the service..I don't know if the lady was stressed out because there's a lot of people and there's only 2 of them serving.. But they need to add more server/waiter during peak hours.. The guy was doing 3 jobs, at the bar, cashier and serving as well. I feel bad for them. We were waiting for our food for a long time, probably 30-40mins. When we got out of the restaurant, there was a lot of people waiting.. I will definitely come back again, just not peak hours."}
{"text":"La Santisima's been in my bookmark list for some time. I had heard a lot of good things about it and their menu had some items you don't often see such as cochinita pibil and chile en nogada. We got here around brunch time and I decided on the black mole chilaquiles. I love mole and I also love chilaquiles so the combo sounded perfect. The chilaquiles come with your choice of \"traditional vegetable,\" egg, or options for meat such as chicken. I asked the server what vegetables came with the vegetable chilaquiles but there seemed to be a language barrier; he didn't really understand what I was asking him, only saying yes there are vegetables and when I asked again, that it was a popular choice.

When we arrived we were seated promptly by the hostess but it took quite a bit of time for a server to come over and take our orders. So, we had plenty of time (Plenty....) to take in the atmosphere. I love the Dia de Los Muertos theme of the restaurant and the paintings of la Catrina were stunning. We also indulged in the salsa bar which had a plethora of unique options such as sesame, pecan, and peanut salsa. While I appreciate all the variety, most of the salsas to me were just so-so. Either they were too one-dimensional in taste or had an overpowering flavor that was a turn off for me. My favorite of all the ones I tried was the pecan salsa. I normally don't like creamy salsas but I liked the nuanced, nutty flavor combined with rich smooth creaminess. One suggestion would be to list the heat level for all the salsas since some were a lot hotter than others (I think the peanut was the most spicy of the bunch I tried).

Getting our dishes also took quite a bit of time. There was only one other table (A 4-top) that had ordered ahead of us and our meals weren't really that complicated to make. When I received my dish, it looked nice but when I looked at the ingredients I thought, \"This is it?\" It was a handful of chips, a ton of mole sauce, a small sprinkling of melted cheese and a small portion of black beans. As for the \"traditional vegetables\", I received a laughable amount of the tiniest pieces of avocado (2 pieces not quite the size of a pinkie finger), and about 4 slivers of red onion. Are they really hurting for money that much they can't spare me more onion at least? Or at least a regular sized piece of avocado? If I had known there was so little in this dish I might have spruced it up by upgrading to adding an egg or chicken. The taste itself was OK. I did enjoy the complex flavors of the mole sauce and the chips tasted good but after a while the dish really needed some extra forms of vegetable (Or bigger portions of them) to balance out all the deep, earthier flavors. The chilaquiles came with 2 buttered slices of baguette which I thought was weird. I've never had crusty bread with chilaquiles before. They tasted good at least.

I did take a bite of another breakfast dish, one with chorizo, hash browns, beans and egg. That one was a huge portion and a lot better.

While I did enjoy the ambiance, my dish was not worth the amount of money I paid for it. Add to that the painfully slow service when it wasn't even that busy I would probably visit another Mexican restaurant in this area over this one."}
{"text":"I saw this on an episode of Diners, Drive thrus, and Dives. The seating and parking are very limited, but we were lucky enough to find a table big enough for the four of us. Our order did take much longer than expected because they were out of tortillas for an enchilada my wife ordered - so they made it from scratch. When it arrived it was magnificent. I ordered three tacos including a Oaxaca Black Mole Taco. That was one of the most incredible tacos I have ever had. I have had mole before and wasn't a big fan, but this was fantastic. The salsa bar was good, the chips and salsa excellent, and the horchata was the best I have ever had. I would certainly go here every opportunity I had."}
{"text":"Love this place- only wish we didn't have to wait outside to get in!! That beau g said it's worth the wait!  We got tacos but saw some quesadillas that looked amazing- next time!"}
{"text":"Yes, my 3 year old spilled salsa not once not twice but 3 times. Our sever happily cleaned it up all 3 times. 

Probably only 1 or 2 salsas that are mild enough for kids. Ours enjoyed the cliantro one and the Pico de gallo. She tried a few others but immediately downed water and her face turned a little red. She may have grown a little hair on her chest. Our favorite salsas were the peanut and guacamole. 

I had the street tacos. Carne Asada taco was on point. Ranking the 3 I had
1. Carne Asada
2. Al Pastor
3. Chicken

Wish I could tell you about the rice but the girl ate it all, so if she ate it I'm sure you will enjoy it too. 

Next time I need multiple margaritas. Happy hour, anyone?!?!"}
{"text":"I often judge a Mexican food restaurant by the beans, and let's say this comes close to my nanas beans. The rice is good too! Simple white rice with lime, cilantro and green chili. The tacos where good and full of flavor but the michada toped it off! Probably one of the best I've had; and I make my own. 

The only issue is it's small so you might have to wait to get a table. But it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. Heard great things, however I was so disappointed. The food was ok. I tried 3 different Tacos and the el pastor had a good flavor the meat on the other hand was chewy and didn't taste like pork. Salsa bar had many choices but no flavor at all. This place feels very neglected and dirty. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Wow. Incredible menu of unique tacos and excellent margaritas. One extra secret - a wide array of unique salsa choices to boot!  A no frills environment where you really feel you are in a local's place. Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Great place!!! Service was excellent getting seated took a little longer then I liked but well worth the little wait. I recommend trying the 3 taco platter for first time this way you can try a little of everything. But Mole was definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, salsa bar was amazing.  The neighborhood is a little sketchy,  I was approached for money by a small family.  Still worth the trip. The art on the wall is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Just really good salsa's and Tacos!!  Just had a late lunch with the wife...had the fish tacos plate and the pork tacos plate accompanied by housemade horchata...both tacos were really good...especially liked the salsa to accompany the pork tacos.  The beans and rice were good. The horchata had fresh strawberries and nuts in it, tasted like they had  just made it!   Salsa bar has a really good selection..especially like the avacado and the tomato chipotle.  Will be back for more and try their queso's or a burrito."}
{"text":"Best Salsa bar in the valley!  Very creative and delicious.  Just thinking about you guys makes my mouth water."}
{"text":"I love the food at santisima.  the salads are much larger than necessary but very tasty and fresh. I usually order them to go while at work. It could easily be shared with two people. 
Another favorite is the Mayan cochinita pibil tacos.  They're not the mini tacos that you find at so many restaurants these days; they're hearty and filling and greasy AF, but also they are what really brings me back. 
Their margaritas are really good and they have several different types to choose from. One common thing I have noticed is that there are not enough servers for the amount of tables and people that are there. I guess what I am saying is that you might only get one margarita, so make it last."}
{"text":"Sorry, Phoenix location...after all was weighed out and a huge discussion...Glendale puts the boot on and knows what to do with it. I think this one converted most of that boot into real estate for Mother Goose. UGH...the parking is terr-id, the food is above phenomenal and the service sucks....what to do. Geez, I mean I HATE to do this to such a quality food place but everything was so frustrating about this morning. We pull up, no parking...end up putting my boyfriends MLC car on the street...gasp, its next to a homeless pretty sure 2 brain celled and sucking on Tide Pods dilapidated shirtless, shoeless walk of life. No good. The service, seriously I can't say much because  it did not exist. I actually got up and went to bar to locate how we were going to wet our whistle...the salsa is beyond the best, the meat, the marinades and the quality is above and beyond the absolute best! Best pibil I have ever enjoyed and the tinga is amazing...seriously GLENDALE, GO.  I just hate the parking, lack of service and the cramped restaurant with a bar that has no bar stools and ...oh wait I got it!!! the server and the parking spaces are the same...they don't exist....damn."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! The food, service, salsa bar and atmosphere are all excellent. The Conchitna Pibil tacos are the best thing ever. My family loves the Mole! I have also had the Mahi Mahi tacos, they are great too. I have not been to the original location but nothing about this location sells you short. 

The strawberry salsa is surprisingly great. I fact, all of the salsas were. There is so many its unreal! I had a house margarita, it was great too. I have nothing but great things to say about this awesome establishment. I have now been back 3 times since my first visit and have not been let down.

PS....the beans and rice are authentic and extremely great too :)"}
{"text":"It is interesting that the bust of a tattooed woman above this restaurant specializing in tacos should have such a strong Aztec feel to it since, according to Wikipedia the Spanish conquistadors were the first Europeans to enjoy tacos and incidentally wiped out the Aztecs. I guess that means cultures may come and go but tacos, they are forever, and thank goodness because this place, one heck of an bargain for such a great foodie experience.

The restaurant, if you don't know what you are looking for, can be easy to drive past so have you smartphone out with the map function on Yelp to make sure you don't miss it. Once I arrived, as it was just me, I sat at the bar instead of taking up a whole table. After ordering my drink, which comes in a take-out cup (and I ordered iced-tea, not the famous Horchata which seems well worth trying) you get a basket of tips and then you can go hit the salsa bar which has at least a dozen different types of salsa. I was partial to the peanut salsa, sort of feels like a Thai/Mexico crossover though the pecan salsa, which creamy, was somewhat bland.  I did especially like the 7 pepper salsa, a mix of roasted green peppers, slivers of garlic and olive oil, from what I could tell and their more traditional red salsas seemed quite good.

I had the two taco special, which is about $10 and comes with a small side order of rice (fluffy white rice with corn in it, nothing special) and a small container of re-fried pinto beans, also nothing special but they look nice on the taco plate. For the two tacos I ordered, and this is a mouthful, the \"Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco\" and some sort of grilled steak taco..both came made with two corn tortillas instead of one and the nice thing, they were not overly soft but had a dry feel to them that kept them from getting soggy from any juices from the taco fillings.

The grilled steak taco had some sort of lime based topping that was really good and both tacos were quite substantive. The Cochinita taco was made with pork shoulder roasted with some sort of red spice and what tasted like orange juice and topped with pickled onion and it was also quite delicious. I did like adding some spicy salsa to that one to kick up the heat a bit.

The menu online is rather limited compared to what they offer now but for a meal that was $13 with a drink and tax, it was a great food experience. If this place was up in Scottsdale instead off of McDowell and 16th St (by the way, easy to get there on the 202, just get off on 24th, go to McDowell, drive to 16th Street and turn. I plan to take some co-workers from the office here next Friday so I can share the experience.

Oh, by the way, found t his place because it was listed as one of the best new 25 restaurants in Phoenix in Phoenix magazine, and they were spot on. Next time I have to try the Horchata which is enhanced with pecans and fresh fruit. Bottom line, worth you time to go here! :-)

Bit of an add on - went back this Friday and boy, even at about 11:30 it was packed. I tried the Horchata this time and the best I've had - I like the pieces of pecan and diced fruit they mix in with it. I also had the steak taco, I guess it is the Condessa taco, that has the spice and olive oil mix on it and it was wonderful, especially with the oil based salsa that tastes like it is made with oil, dried crushed papers and salt, excellent, and I also ordered the grilled squash which, while not amazing, is a nice addition to the meal. I have decided, now that I've eaten there a second time, that I like the grilled steak tacos but the pulled meat, both the chicken and the pork, nothing special, and the side of rice this time, really clumpy and overly sticky, not like what I had last time so I'll give it four stars but need to do something a bit more special with the rice and beans to get a five."}
{"text":"Love this place for tacos, beer and a huge variety of different salsas! If you're looking for good tacos in Phoenix, you should definitely try La Santisima."}
{"text":"OK so I came here to try the Horchata because I saw all the great reviews on it and I am glad I did because it is AMAZING!!! They put just the right amount of ice in it and the bottom has strawberries and it's mixed with a bunch of other yummy fruits such as mangos (i'm not entirely sure what else quite yet... still in the process of drinking lol) and then it's topped with just the right amount of cinnamon.  The only reason why I only gave them three stars is because I have yet to try the food but I will on my next visit and on top of that I tried to call multiple times to place my order and nobody ever picks up the phone which is a no go for me because I'm always on the run!"}
{"text":"Best Mayan Cocinita Pibil this side of the Border!! I've been coming to this place since they served tacos on wax paper in plastic baskets, and though the atmosphere has changed, the food has not. Solid menu, great salsa bar, delicious albeit expensive margaritas, and very friendly staff in a cozy, genuine atmosphere. Be prepared to wait -this place is small, with only a handful of tables, but very worth the wait!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! Everything here is fabulous. The drinks the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing fair with a laid back atmosphere. Love the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"We are talking about \"one of\" the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix according to the internet, a city with a huge Hispanic population. With high expectations, La Santisima was the first restaurant I visited after I landed.

Saw some reviews saying that the wait is usually insane, so I went for a late lunch at around 2:30pm, and it was pretty empty. There were still parties leaving and coming. The inside has beautiful art, and great Mexican restaurant vibe. My server handed me the menus and came back shortly for my drinks along with some nachos. There was a whole list of margaritas to choose from, so I asked him to bring me the best seller. 

Near the back of the restaurant is a sauce/dip station where you can go customize your own personal dip for nachos according to your preference, or you can get each sauce individually. There were at least 14 different ones to choose from, and I never tried most of them!

Server came back with my margarita, and helped me finalize my main, something that he said he loves as well. That's great, now my expectation is even higher. 

The margarita is B O M B. The first sip made me go whoa and my super cool server chuckled. He came over and told me he has made at least 5 of them today! 

Food came faster than I expected, in under 10 minutes. It looked massive, could probably feed 2. At that point I was close to drooling and the excitement on my face probably gave it away - my server asked if I wanted a picture with the food!! LOL how awesome is that. Took pictures with the food and I dived in. 

First bite and I was in heaven.....

This is what I call perfect Mexican food. The green sauce was perfection, I could literally eat anything with it. Rice and meat were cooked just right, and I ate about a quarter of the food in less than 2 minutes. My server checked up on me while I was in the middle of stuffing my face, and he mentioned that I came on a good day. Usually theres a line up throughout the day.

I was only able to finish half of my food, really want to go back and try the Quesa that my server was raving about!"}
{"text":"My daughter took me here after a Cardinals game and it was Great!  It's a small place with lots of character.  The salsa bar is amazing and the food is even better!  It's far from QC where I live but if I'm in Phoenix I'll stop in for lunch or dinner for sure!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The worst thing about this place is the number of choices.  Well, they also charge for extra chips.  But you shouldn't eat so many chips anyway, save room for their delicious tacos.  The Pibil are great, as are the gaucho tacos. I'll definitely be coming back to try more of their creations."}
{"text":"This place has some great tacos that are on par with some of the best that I've ever had in Mexico. I order a slow roasted pork shoulder taco and the veggie taco. As great as the pork was, the Santisima veggie taco was out of this world. I will probably order one every time I go back. The ambiance and were awesome as well. 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"I love the food here, but service is at best two stars.  The wait staff tends to gather around the bar and chit chat, instead of checking on patrons.  During our last dinner, we were lucky
to get one refill and at no point did the waitress check on us after the food was delivered. I actually had to leave the table and go looking for her so we can get the check.
The kitchen as always is very slow, so plan on waiting for at least 30 min, even if your order is a simple burrito. The guac is very good for the first few bites, but then you discover that the bottom half of your $10 guac is nothing but onions and tomatoes.  So I am paying $10 for a few slivers of cut up avocado and the rest is the free salsa that's sitting on the salsa bar?

Again food is excellent, but they really need to make sure that the rest of the place comes together.  I am willing to drive out here and search for parking, but more visits with bad service and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 10 and had an awesome, awesome meal. The waitress was so on top of things, and made sure that everyone had drinks (relatively) quickly, and always had full water glasses. (I say relatively because one margarita took a while and it took a few tries to get my coke, but again, we were a party of 10, so it wasn't a big deal). 

While we waited for our food, we sampled the salsa bar, which has 16 flavors of salsa. The waitress brought baskets of chips as soon as we sat down. Each one tasted so different, and while we didn't love all of them, we had so much fun sampling and comparing the different flavors. 

I had the fish tacos, which were awesome. Everyone on yelp raves about them, and they were totally right. So flavorful and the tortilla held up well. I also had a quesadilla - most places make their quesadillas with flour tortillas, so I was ecstatic to see that they made theirs with corn (extra points for being gluten-free-friendly!). They let me sub out the pork for the steak, and the quesadilla did not disappoint - stuffed with cheese, steak, and some veggies, this this was awesome. 

Wish I didn't live so far, because I would absolutely become a regular here. 

Good for: cheap dinner, night out with friends, date night, any time you're feeling hungry!"}
{"text":"It is in the weirdest area!  But the food, good!  Had the shrimp and carne asada tacos, the beef was a little tough, but the shrimp tacos were yummy!  Best part, eating all the guacamole they had out, yummy!!  It's worth going back ::-)"}
{"text":"Their tacos are some of the best I've had.  My wife got the quesadilla which is fried and very big.  Everything was really delicious."}
{"text":"Loved the salsa bar. The food was good. I got the quesadilla and it was delicious. 

However, the customer service was horrible. The server took forever on our order, refilling our drinks, getting our checks etc. The place had flies flying everywhere we had to shoo the flies away from our food. The restaurant was dirty."}
{"text":"This is a cool little place! I thought the day of the dead type decor was cool. I also appreciate their salsa bar! It's a serve yourself and had lots of choices. Free chips were served per usual, and the bar pared with these. The menu is HUGE, lots and lots of choices. It's a little confusing but the server was helpful and could answer all our questions. I ordered a burrito enchilada style. It was good, just too much rice for me. The overall attentiveness of the server held this place back, we were not greeted or served in an acceptable amount of time, and we did not get a single refill. We were a group of about 8, glad there was not automatic large gratuity."}
{"text":"Just left this place. I understand they're busy, but that's what every business tries to achieve right? Because they were busy they gave below subpar service. It was a man and woman working and the woman looked miserable and wasn't exactly polite. The guy was trying his best but service suffered. We were told there was a thirty minutes wait originally, but noticed two spots at the bar open. So we asked if we can sit there and she said let me ask. After walking around for ten minutes, not talking with anyone and seeing that we didn't leave she wiped the bar down and we sat. We got our chips and we grabbed our own salsa. After ten minutes we got water. And that's it. No one offered to take our drink order or food order. A single man sat next to us after us, and a four top behind us. The four top was the last to be seated. Got their order taken first. Then the single man. Never us. They looked at us and it's a tiny restaurant so they saw us. The woman seemed like she didn't want us to eat there because they had a bad rush. Well don't worry we won't come back again. And all the placards for their awards were for another taco shop."}
{"text":"Went to the symphony during the mid part of the day and happened to run into La Condesa based on a Yelp review. This place is very tasty. Their salsas are exceptionally good and a must if you make a visit. Their drinks are good as well. All items served are unique in preparation and taste. We had the taco's gaucho, quesadilla and some orchata. The food was excellent and the service was friendly and attentive. Overall this place great for a mid day lunch of evening meal."}
{"text":"If I happen to be driving on 16th street south of McDowell and want a margarita and some fine Mexican fare, my first choice is Barrio Cafe.  However, when venturing out with my nonalcoholic parents this weekend, I consulted Yelp for some good Mexican food, subscribing to my parents theory that the most authentic Mexican food is in a hole in the wall joint in a scary part of town.  Well, La Condesa is not in an area where I would take an after dark stroll, but it is by no means a hole in the wall!  The restaurant is small, clean, well decorated and most importantly they have a salsa bar filled with amazing salsas, made fresh daily to suit all taste preferences.  

My parents and I had various burritos and the bill was under $20 for the 3 of us.  Mom still hauled away quite the selection of \"to go\" sauces and the waitress was very polite and didn't even call her cheap (which I of course made sure to do)!

To make the evening even more exciting, I accidentally spilled my water on the floor and knocked a painting off the wall when I stood up to leave.   I will return to this restaurant not only because i feel guilty that the restaurant lost revenue by us dining there, both through extra takeout and damage, but the food was also excellent!"}
{"text":"The best tacos, hands down. Comfort food: beans & rice are just as great. Salsa bar is unique and amazing. Kinda steps out of the traditional taco scene, but great food none the less. On the downside: small dining area, spotty service, lighting is a little off. Overall this is a must-try."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out after driving past it so many times. Good food, and atmosphere. Service was extremely slow. I enjoyed my experience but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Tiny hole in the wall. We went for our first time on a Sunday about 430pm. Didn't think it would be busy since it was a little to early for dinner and late for lunch but we're we wrong. Had to wait only a minute or so for someone to leave and a table to open up but this place had people coming in non stop. My wife and I split 6 different tacos that the waiter recommended. All very good. Favorite two were the steak called something else and the shrimp. Those two were unbelievably good. Steak was super tender and shrimp tasted very fresh. Very well seasoned. The other tacos we tried were all good too but not as good as the two listed above iny my opinion. We both also had their house Margarita which was fantastic. Definately will come back. My new favorite mexican place for tacos."}
{"text":"I came here because my coworkers were all talking about how good this place was. I also heard that they had shark tacos that my bf really wanted to try. The place is super small and kind of divey. They have a salsa bar for you to enjoy when you first sit down. The strawberry salsa was my favorite. Sweet but a little bit spicy. They definitely get you on the chips though because there are no free refills like most other places. Another basket of chips is almost $3. I got the chicken mole quesadilla. Their quesadillas are definitely not like your typical quesadilla. It's almost like a deep fried calzone. The portion is huge though, I could only eat half of it. My bf got one shark taco to try and it was kind of disappointing. It tasted like cod and there wasn't very much flavoring. The taco just came with a tiny bit of lettuce and some green sauce. We got the guacamole and it was delicious. They put raisins and some other fruit in it. At first it sounds strange but trust me, it's so good. Wish we saved some chips to eat with it since we ate most of it with the salsa. The service is friendly and the food came out pretty quick. I'm glad we tried it out but don't know if I would be dying to go back."}
{"text":"Gonna keep it short(ish) and simple today.  Arrived at 6PM on a Sunday, and to say that parking is extremely limited is an understatement.  The restaurant itself is small, which explains why there weren't too many parking spots.  It was a 45 minute wait for a table for two so we ordered takeout instead.  A little crammed and loud with people talking over one another, but it was actually pretty cozy.  The staff were really nice, pleasant, and efficient even with the crowd and gave us little lids for the salsa, along with our horchata, after we placed our order.

Fast forward through standing around awkwardly in what felt like everyone's way for 20 minutes in the restaurant, we had our burros in hand - an Al Pastor burro and La Santisima burro (chicken).  The burros are pretty sizable and scrumptious.  The salsa bar is probably what sets this place apart from the rest.  It's fun and most of them have a little kick to it, so have a glass of water nearby.  I loved their horchata, it's a little sweeter than other horchatas, has more cinnamon, and the fruits (strawberries) are a great touch.  Definitely will be back, probably for takeout."}
{"text":"Nice, small restaurant and good music as well.  I showed up on Tuesday around 4:00 PM.  Only 3 tables occupied, had to wait for service for at least 5 minutes and of course, when dining alone, 5 min seems like 10.   I ordered the 3 street taco plate with chicken asado, al pastor and the Mexico City Taco (can't remember the name).  They were tasty, but truly uneventful.  Ive had better flavor from a roach coach and I am a street taco lover!!!  The chips were good and the salsa bar had a wide range of salsas to choose from and all were delicious and tried 6 of them.  On a side note, the chair was old and ripped my pants!!!  Oh well, shit happens.  All in all, it was good, not great.  I would have hoped for more timely, enthusiastic greeting.  I rate it as \"average\""}
{"text":"La Santisma has some loft reviews and on top of that it has been visited by Guy Fieri.  You probably already know that if you're reading this review.  Those two items equate to a chance for a letdown of epic proportions.  I'm happy to report this place lived up to the hype and then some.

It is really small in terms of dining space, so arrive early or be prepared to wait.  Also straddling up to the bar is a good strategy to get seated as well.

The salsa selection is extraordinary - I think there were 10 or so different offerings ranging from pico to sesame.  If you're a lover of all things fire, definitely go for their hotter sauces but beware as these pack a punch.  

The menu is loaded with tacos - this is Santisma's speciality.  Very vegetarian friendly but it also has choices if you're feeling like more of a carnivore.  I went with the fried avocado, cactus and la santisma tacos - all were awesome.  These things are big and they come double wrapped in tortillas so definitely keep that in mind.

Santisma also has a wide variety of margaritas available and to top it off - free chips (first serving).  Go!  This place is legit!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Mexican food with the most amazing salsa bar! We were a very large party and they weren't prepared for us, but they did their very best to accommodate our group! Food was very good and they served a great margarita. Very reasonable"}
{"text":"Hello this was rated Top Mexican by Guy F. Need I say more. It's got a feeling not vibe with a traditional Mexican menus. If you like the day of the dead - the s place is all about that and what drew my husband and I to this place. The strawberry Mango Salsa is so addictive! They have about 10 different salsas to choose from - you can't go wrong. 
Tacos are awesome - burritos are big enough for 2 hungry people!"}
{"text":"La Condessa is muy Bueno in many ways. The tacos are always fresh, from shark to carne asada you really can't go wrong. (Although I heard it is bad karma to eat shark).

They carry Mexican beers that I have never heard of before, last time I had an Estrella and it was delicious. They have a full bar with tons of exotic tequilas and they are generous on the pours.

The servers are attentive and sweet and the set up is old style cool. 

What really keeps me coming back is the salsa bar (oh the salsa bar)! Pecan salsa, 7 pepper, chipotle, sesame... They carry over a dozen and you will have to come many times to experience the perfect salsa/taco combination. It is worth every delectable trip!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. We waited 15 minutes for a table when the place was practically empty. They sat us next to the hot window (triple-digit hot day) when there was plenty of open tables all over the restaurant. The guacamole was weird (cranberries in guac?) and I hate those salsa bars that give you those tiny plastic containers that are too small for you to dip your chips into. The margaritas and tacos were good though. Just a warning...don't get the three taco plate...it's too much food. One taco was enough with the beans and rice."}
{"text":"My friend raved about it so I thought I'd try it. First off, the place is SMALL. luckily we got there right when they opened. Seemed like as soon as we got seated, the place started to fill up. I enjoyed the salsa bar and the different assortment of salsas. As for my actual food. I didn't care for it much. To me, it didn't have much of a flavor to it unless it was drowned in the salsa from the salsa bar. Was going to order a strawberry horchata to go but every time we asked for something, the waitress took a while to come back (she only came back in a hurry when it was time to pick up the money), so I said forget it. I won't be back but at least I can say I went."}
{"text":"Waited 20 mim, to get water and no service.  Its ok your not the only place that serves Mexican"}
{"text":"Wow!! The place does not lie! The name says it all - gourmet tacos!! 

Upon arrival, I noticed the authentic touch with the outside doors - 3 to be exact. Check out the pics! Then coming inside, I see vibrant colors with matching works of art affixed on the walls. A patio is also available if you're looking to soak in some sunshine. 

Once seated, we got a basket of warm chips. They have an amazing salsa bar with a variety of flavors to try. Some of the ones we tried were the: pecan, cilantro, La Santisima salsa, chipotle, radish of some sort, guacamole, and more. So fun to try different spicy kick flavors!

Today I tried the Aztec Tinga taco (a Mexico City specialty), which is shredded chicken with tomato, onion, and Aztec chipotle salsa. It's got a little spice, but balances out with the double corn tortilla. This taco was meaty and juicy! 

The other one I tried was the Mayan Cochinita Pibil taco - a Yucatan speciality! This was a true fork tender pork shoulder with achiote rojo topped with lime marinated onions and salsa Habanera Maya.  Lots of meat!! Love! 

I also had the chance to try the La Santisima special taco with chicken and cheese and a steak filled taco. Both were amazing as well. Each of these were ordered a la carte ($4-$5 each). If you order 2 of the same, you get it with a side of rice and beans. The beans have a bit of spice and the rice included kernels of corn. Yummy! 

Finally, I ordered their version of a horchata. It is unlike any other horchata I've tried! It's my first one that included fruits and pecans! Quite unique and refreshing! 

I'm looking forward to trying the other gourmet tacos and hopefully will make room for the flan!!"}
{"text":"Their food is good, the low rating is for their customer service. The waiter is rude and inattentive. He completely forgot about my friends drink. The lady who brought out the food realized she didn't have a drink so she brought her one. Not returning - not worth the experience."}
{"text":"I mean, it's whatever. At 1500 reviews, who cares at this point. 

We're never in the area and decided to stop in for lunch this past Saturday afternoon. Bad choice. We were completely underwhelmed.

Pros:

Food. The salsas were great (our chips were stale though...), the tacos were outstanding. I had a chicken tinga taco (so juicy and topped with my favorite: picked red onion), a steak/veggie taco (topped with some sort of fried cheese...HELLO!) and a battered fish taco. I finished most of it, but I should have stopped way earlier. #fatpants

Cons:

Literally everything else. They were clearly understaffed (which by reading the reviews...is a trend? What?) and kept a wait, even though tons of tables were empty during our meal. 

Bussing: We finished our chips and I piled the empty salsa ramekins, used napkins, etc. and pushed it to the side of our tiny table. You'd think our server would remove it when she set our plates down. Nope. WTF? I had to flag down a bus boy to put in his tub. Our table was so small and we needed the real estate to eat comfortably. When we were clearly done and asked for our check, she still didn't bother to pick up our plates and clear the table.

Wait: I get it. I worked in the service industry for way too long. I do understand. However, I've never been so close to walking out of a restaurant before. It took about 40 minutes for us to get our lunch. Our server walked by and told us \"Oh, your food is about to come out.\" That was the midway point, as we waited about 20 more minutes. Why would she just say that to us when it wasn't clearly ready? It felt like bizarro-world

The dining room was pretty grimy.

Truly, the food was amazing. But, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Hands down best horchata I've had.
Great variety of salsas to choose from.
Good food!

4 stars because the tortillas weren't as good as other places."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both visits were great. I love the Salsa Bar they have with fresh homemade salsas. Both visits I ordered Taco plates. I have had the Tinga Chicken and the Carne Asada. The Chicken was much better. I have also had the mahi taco and a shrimp taco. Those were amazing. Their Horchata is delicious as well as their rice and beans that accompany their Taco Plates. I highly recommend this place. I hear their margaritas are great too. I will be back.......many more times."}
{"text":"I went to this place when I was in town visiting friends an I loved it! The tacos were great and the prices were very reasonable but what made this place amazing was the salsa bar that had over 12 varieties that were some of the best salsas I've ever Tasted. I will absolutely go again when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"We had a few hours before heading to the PHX airport so we stopped by La Santisima for lunch. Being Mexican from SoCal I know good tacos. This place does not disappoint, everything we tried was good. Plenty of taco options and an awesome salsa selection (strawberry salsa my favorite). The only disappointment was that they didn't have any horchata when we arrived. Had the following. 
 
- Sonoran Carne Asada Taco
- Aztec Tinga Taco
- La Condesa Veggie Taco
- Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco

I'd definitely go back and recommend it to anyone looking to get a local meal near the airport (about 5 mins away)"}
{"text":"A huge fan of tacos!! This place use to be a lot better. However, the service is definitely better now days. The tacos are just so dry.. there was three of us and we tried three different tacos each.. and we all thought the same thing \"they were too dry!\" I do like the fact that there is a salsa bar! Oh and Mexican coca cola!"}
{"text":"Wow...this place really knocked my socks off.  This is exactly what Phoenix needs, a cool place to eat great Sonoran/Mexican food.  The owners sure had a nice vision and succeded in creating a great spot for the neighborhood.

The tacos and quesadilla I've had here was nothing less than spectacular.  Having lots of flavor and not skimping on the portions. The salsa bar is quite fun as well with many different and uniques choices to choose from.  Never seen so many salsas offered anywhere else and I'm sure I will make it through all of them with my many visits to follow.

Keeping the flavor of the area being on the edge of a very artsy neighborhood the decor is amazing.  Vibrant paintings all around and murals on the bathroom doors definitely makes this place stand out with style.

This place is a must see for anyone who likes great food and culture.  Take a deep breath before you walk in and inhale an experience I am sure you will remember."}
{"text":"Best gourmet tacos in Phoenix.  Don't worry, even though the tacos are nice you don't need a tie to dig in!"}
{"text":"I was here!  Guy Fieri came earlier than me as well!

The best modern Mexican and first Mexican place we went to in Phoenix.  This place is a hit!

The service was slow and they forgot our drink orders a few times.  But the tequila they suggested was good.

Here comes the most important part.. their food.  We ordered their shark taco to share.  I had their El Gaucho Burro and my wife had their El Gaucho Quesa.  My wife is not a big quesadilla fan, but she liked it and it was so good when I tried it!  Her quesa had the perfect crisp texture to each bite.  My burro was excellent.  Since we both had El Gaucho, the fillings were the same ingredients.  Here's the climax.  They put cucumbers and bell peppers into their El Gaucho Burro and Quesa; that is a genius idea!  Those 2 ingredients brang out the taste of each individual ingredient from our burro and quesa.

Man, it was good!

Prices are good.

They have their own salsa bar.  I recommend their creamy cilantro salsa.  They also have good spicy ones as well.

A chips refill for your chips and salsa will cost you about $2?

Oh yeah, this place is pretty small.  They try to utilize as much as they can.

Very rare you will find Chinese eating Mexican, but I saw a few here.

Got to come here."}
{"text":"I desperately wanted to love this place.  Unfortunately I thought it was just average.  The salsa bar, the unique tacos, etc. all seemed like the right lineup.  Taste is king and I didn't think any of my 4 different tacos was striking.  Not a bad dining experience at all, just not amazing.  

Ambience, service, etc were all great.  Perhaps others will find it more amazing.

Maybe I would try a burrito next time?"}
{"text":"We have been to Santisima several times. The food is very good and the salsa bar not only adds, but makes it fun, too. Drinks were tasty, and service is good. One point to improve would be that we almost always have a long wait for our food. Given that it's tiny, there might not be much to do about that...Maybe expand?"}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting this location...while the food is good the service absolutely SUCKS! If you bring up your concerns to the waitress it will just be laughed at and disregarded. We sat with empty drinks for over 20m and we're never offered refills  The entire time we were there we only seen the waiter when he placed our order and brought the check."}
{"text":"So good! So good. A must try taco shop if you are in Phoenix. I ordered 3 different tacos and was able to turn them into 6 since they put a lot of fillings and 2 corn tortillas. The mole is so delish and you gotta order this taco. I ordered the steak and it was good too, but my fave...the carnitas taco. The pork is so tender and flavorful! I also love all the salsas! I just wish they didn't run out of some of them...there were so many to choose from it was hard to decide what to try so I relied an a regular to steer me in the right direction. The margarita was ok, but I would definitely go back for the mole and the carnitas!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such high reviews. Ate here on the way to the airport. The restaurant including our table was filthy. The whole place seems like it is covered in grime. The food was greasy and lacked flavor. We had horchata, shrimp and mole tacos. Does not live up to the hype. Our waitress was non-existent for most of the meal and the food took forever to come out. I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Tacos with unique ingredients, salsa bar with endless options. Need I say more? So delicious. Quaint and cute inside. Delicious! And reasonably priced. Two tacos with beans and rice for around $10 and it's plenty of food."}
{"text":"One of many great little Mexican restaurants in the area, this one definitely has the best salsa bar. This provides for amazing combinations on a variety of tacos selections. Great place to drop in for a late lunch or early dinner, when they aren't too busy."}
{"text":"My favorite taco shop! The variety of tacos and salsas make it nearly impossible to choose even one favorite meal. The horchata is great- mixed with fresh fruit and spices...different from how I've previously had the drink, but a happy surprise!"}
{"text":"So people rave about their food here. I had the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco, Cabo Shrimp Taco, Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco and the Santisima taco. They were good. The seafood tacos were basic but good, I wish they put more effort into the slaw they put on them. The other two tacos were shined much more. The big hitter of the meal was actually the salsa. I would come back to this place and just eat salsa and chips it was that good. I had a house margarita and took one sip and non another sip it was gross. Overall stick to the taco, salsa, chips and a beer (don't touch the margarita), stick to that and it will be most likely in your top 10 Mexican restaurants you have ever eaten at."}
{"text":"Vegan post- this place is the ultimate. The salsa bar is on another level, the avocado is my favorite. The quesadillas might be the best meal I've ever had. I got no cheese, add beans to quesadilla. The rice is the best rice I've ever had, easily. The nopales tacos are also amazing."}
{"text":"Vegan: I got the veganized quesadilla based on a few reviews here. They can't add beans inside like somebody mentioned, only on the side (make sure to ask for beans without cheese on top) If you are a \"junk vegan\" you may be good to go. I personally hardly eat fried things and wanted to make an exception for this. They fry the whole thing so it sits in a layer of oil on the plate and the spinach and mushrooms etc inside are soaked as well - all I tasted was the oil. I have only been vegan for a year so I can imagine this must be really good with the cheese but in vegan you may be better off with a burrito or taco. 
Omni hubby had the tacos and loved them! Salsas are really nice as well, cilantro, pecan and Mexican were really good.
I would go back to try their other stuff!"}
{"text":"The best part of this place is the salsa bar and chips!  There were 15 different salsas to try and you can make a meal out of that!  The beef street tacos were yummy along with the rice.  The horchata was very tasty and unique with the fruit!  Go early because there was a line out the door, but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good, the reviews certainly make you think its going to be, we went here twice, the first time our food was under whelming and service was ok and the atmosphere was fun.  We always try and give a place two tries before never going back or writing a so so review, so visit two was actually worse than the first visit. Tried various street tacos, no seasoning, meats dried out, and service was so so.  This will not be a place we try a third time, there are to many other great places in Phx.  I wish them luck, I hope it was just two bad days, and we happened to show up both times."}
{"text":"I love their salsa bar , there is a taste for everybody. You should try mole they make , it's excellent. Good portions, I can barely eat half of my burro. Food is just amazing. Very neat small place, one of those places that you should try at least once. Bathrooms is a little bit of an issue , that ladies bathroom door should be fixed , it's little uncomfortable to sit where while someone else can just walk in while you do your business."}
{"text":"My tinga taco was soggy as if they left it there for awhile. The salsa bar was amazing and the customer service was too. The reason why I gave it 3 star is because we were charged gratuity even though it was only 5 of us. The receipt clearly said 6 people or more. My party was going to give her more than the gratuity rate, but because of that, we decided not to give her anything. I shouldn't be asked to give them tips. I want to tip them according to the service."}
{"text":"Stop reading and GO HERE NOW! Best tacos ever. No really, they also have a crazy awesome salsa bar.... SALSA BAR! Why are you still reading? GO!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place.  Pretty good food and interesting decor.  Not the usual \"Mexican\" place so come in with an open mind."}
{"text":"Very different from your average Mexican cuisine. Everything we ordered was yummy. Love everything from their house made salsas to their artwork. Thanks for your warm customer service!"}
{"text":"The Salsa Bar! Holy moly! I wish I took a picture, it was huge. I was enamored by the strawberry salsa (tried to replicate at home to no avail). The food was served on clay plates, nice touch, and it was pretty tasty. I recommend this place every time someone asks me of a Mexican restaurant that will blow their expectations away. I do warn, there can be extremely long waits, like at least an hour wait if you're lucky....hence my 4 star review. Now I do know that they were working on opening more dining space, but at the time they also lacked staff. I will try out soon to update this review, but overall it is a great experience."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food ever. Holy moly. Like, not even a competition after I ate here. The food is unbelievable, authentic, and delicious. The location is a bit sketch, but don't let that deter you! Nice and modern on the inside, and can we talk horchata? We should talk horchata. fresh strawberries IN THE HORCHATA. It was like experiencing your first orgasm. You guys are amazing, keep it up, I will for sure be back many many times."}
{"text":"The sauces.  Wow.  Go here and have some tacos and chips and beer and salsa.   Enjoy.  

Repeat.  The salsas.  Did I mention the salsa bar.  Not like anything else


And order the daring tacos.   Not the stuff you can get anywhere.

-----
Second review eating in

Fantastic.  And all those salsas.  Got the burrito this time and it's just as good.  You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"What a cute little place! It's hard to not notice it when driving by :) I had the shark and beer battered fish tacos and they satisfied my craving. First time trying shark though! Love the salsa bar! lots of variety to choose from. Would love to come back and try other options on their menu next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I like the Cochinita Pibil the best. Not a fan of the other tacos and I could do without the rice and beans. The horchata is something to write about. I have never had horchata with fresh ingredients...Very Tasty. The server was nice and quick. You have to get your own salsa so stock up. Would love to stop by again!"}
{"text":"Well reviewed for good reason. Tons of options and cheap margaritas on Tuesday!  If I lived in Arizona I'd for sure be back."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place's Horchata! The salsa bar is great, the tacos are incredible. I love the cute small atmosphere. Great vibes, great food, what else could you ask for? Definitely going back over and over."}
{"text":"We went based on recommendation and it did not let down.  Great taco place.  Ok I am going to go Spanish on this one.  Delicioso!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. We went in around 4pm and there was only one table in there. Exterior was really original and set a good vibe, then we stepped inside and I felt like I was in a tattoo artists bedrooom. 

Took about 5-10 minutes for someone to come out of the kitchen to greet us and seat us which was not a good first impression. The salsa bar had good variety but was set up very poorly. The \"togo\" salsa containers you use to grab you salsas were so small you couldnt even fit a tortilla chip into it, We had to get a plastic spoon to get our salsa onto our chip because there was no metal utensils on the table. They didnt provide us little plates either so our table was a mess before we even started ordering.

As our tacos hit the table the first thing we noticed where that both mine and my husbands plates had big cracks on them. Flea market much?I got the smoked marlin taco which had the texture of canned tuna fish with a minestrone like vegetable concoction on top and the shrimp tacos, pretty decent. The corn tortillas were pretty flimsy though and resembled the storebought el paso brand.

Service was not the best either, our questions about the tacos were answered with finger pointing at the menu and blank looks like...uhh you dunno what achiote rojo is? 

All in all, the fact that we said we should have gone to chipotle instead says everything."}
{"text":"Amazing margaritas. Very strong. Probably 2-4 shots in each but so smooth you can't taste it. Food was good, nothing too special but decent, as well but best value margaritas I've ever had."}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! ....
I've been here a few times now and every single time I come I ask myself \"now why don't I come here more often?\" I do live close by, but then their long line reminds me why lol. 

This place is so freaking delicious! First of all their beans are perfection. And their salsa bar is like its own tasting station lol. 

I've had their bullet burrito, azteca Tinga burrito, shark tacos, shrimp burrito, quesas, guacamole, and their veggie burrito. Everything was great I have no complains. 

If you love horchata you have to try theirs. I promise you will love it! I can go in there for just that a bullet burrito and chips with salsa. LITERALLY.  

It is a very small place so I wouldn't suggest coming during lunch/dinner hours. You will just stand there looking at everyone enjoy their food thinking to yourself \"ok can you please hurry and swallow your meal, because it's my turn to sit and swallow mine\". Lol 
I usually come here before busy lunch hours and dinner hours so I can get a table asap. 

Customer service is always great. Their menu is to the point, my kind of menu!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to go and try La Santisima because i have read great reviews and friends have told me it is amazing. I'm not sure if I had it built it up so high in my head or if it was just meh. I think it was just meh. I ordered the Cabo Shrimp Tacos and they did not have much flavor to them at all. The service is very, very slow so be prepared to spend a lot of time dining here."}
{"text":"Not from around the area and came here based off of the string reviews. Pretty disappointed in the service and quality of food. The tacos were average at best and the drinks were all overpriced. Would not reccoment to others visiting AZ"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal. I can't say enough about this GOURMET taco restaurant. Granted, this menu has more than tacos but you need to look no further than those filthy goooooood tacos. I have came here a few time with several different groups, not once did the sitting render tasteless. I've ordered almost every taco and each is extraordinary within itself. I am a Carne Asada enthusiast! With that said this dandy delight of a taco magician has various types of steak cooked various ways, all producing the bountiful bliss of juicy satisfaction. The salsa bar is a blessing in itself, so many varieties you don't run across at any other taco restaurant. The reviews speak for them self... Get here!"}
{"text":"Finally visited La Santisima.  Thought I would really really like the food, but I didn't.  Although I did finish my plate, it wasn't spectacular in any way.

Before I get to what I ordered, let me make note on how important it is for a restaurant to have an eye soothing menu.  The online menu is great, but the restaurant menu is much more extensive than the short list on the website.  

Unfortunately for me, the menu was much too busy.  The colors were awful and I didn't want to look at it for more than two minutes.   Red and black text looked crammed and didn't stand out the way text on a decently designed menu does.  I barely read past the tacos.  

Ordered three tacos a la carte ($3.99 each). The mesquite cactus taco (I can't remember the dish name) with no queso, La Condesa Veggie with no queso, and the fish taco.  Also a side of guac which cost about $4.

Honestly the guac was the most exciting thing on the table. The food was filling but all three tacos needed some DIY spicing.  Ranking:
1. guacamole - made with dried cranberries and mango.  A bit tangier than I prefer, but palatable.
2. spinach taco - wished the spinach was chopped smaller
3. cactus taco - slabs of cactus made my mouth work overtime 
4. fish taco - too much breading on the fish, and just plain cabbage with bland white sauce drizzled on top.  Wish I had asked for no white sauce. 

The salsa bar is okay.  There were only a few salsas that I thought looked appetizing.  Most were watery and needed some DIY mixing of two or three to get a fantastic flavor.  And with the serving cups being so small, I couldn't grab a decent serving of a favorite salsa.  I refilled at the bar three times and then just gave up.

Our server was kindhearted and brought a sample of horchata.  I have tasted something similar to it, but didn't like it.  Sweet drinks with cinnamon flavor aren't my thing.

If I'm in the area and feeling hungry I would go back.  It's a decent restaurant, but not one to where I would plan a night out."}
{"text":"Question: Living in the vast sea of Arizona taco shops, how does one stand out?

Answer: Just do whatever these people are doing.

From scanning the menu, it seems like the concept here is La Santisima wants to give every regional tradition of Mexican cuisine its chance to shine through a specialty taco. They absolutely knock that goal out the park.

I wish I had 4 stomaches so I could have sampled everything. What I did get though has given me reason to go back again and again to accomplish that goal. 

Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco - bomb

Cabo Shrimp Taco - Bomb.

Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco- BOMB! (please order this for yourself)

Excited to try more when I get the shot."}
{"text":"As someone who's travels to Southern California a few times a year, I sort of know my Mexican food especially as it comes to street tacos and such.  I do admit this place has more protein for your tacos than any other Mexican restaurant I've been in.  It can also be overwhelming the number of choices but at $3.99-$6.50 for a single taco, the prices are pretty high so I had some high expectations.  What I can say is that the al pastor tacos were dry, in fact tasted like tree bark in terms of texture.  The braised pork was good though but the tortas were very interesting, it came out on a toasted French baguette.  It was decent but I had to put quite a bit of salsa in it to moisten it up due to it again being very dry.  Imagine dry meat on a toasted French baguette.

What I believe does set this place apart is their amazing salsa bar, it's self serve and unlimited.  You get your first bowl of chips on the house, refills are $2.70.  The other thing that stood out was the horchata, it had fresh ground cinnamon, some oats and bits of strawberries on the bottom.  It was very interesting, but nonetheless, was very good.  We also had a strawberry margarita, tasted more like sugar water with a half shot of a tequila and very very sweet.  I believe the strawberry margarita was $9.00, so it was a little high.  If I ever go back, I think I'll stick with the horchata instead of their margaritas.  

They said an hour wait for two, we waited outside for 30 minutes and was called, so at least that's nice.  A tip is to write your name, party size and phone number on the waiting list, they will call you when your table is ready.  And no waiting inside either, all waiting is outside."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, the incredibly LARGE parking spaces in a small amount of space leads me to believe this place was either small inside or has horrible drivers for customers, once i entered i assume now it is the latter, a spacious dining room, bar, and outdoor seating available.

First off i ordered a horchata, which was the second best i have ever had, they put a good variety of fruits in there that perfectly complemented the flavor.. 

I then ordered some street tacos, and before they came out i walked up to the Salsa Bar.. oh man, i need more than just a spoon for this place, they have every flavor you would expect, and an delicious peanut salsa.. it was soo tasty i don't even know if the tacos themselves were any good, guess i gotta go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome street tacos. Best in phoenix and cheap! The place is small but the service and food is amazing. This is my new favorite place for tacos."}
{"text":"Just. Brilliant.  This place puts Barrio Cafe to shame.  There isn't a bad thing on the menu.  The food is amazing, the atmosphere is warm and fun, and the service is spot-on.  Oh, and unlike Barrio, the prices are very reasonable.  

Forget the Barrio Cafe hype, THIS place is \"The real deal.\""}
{"text":"The space is tiny. Like the variety of salsas. BOMB Horchata. Food was good. Would try it again."}
{"text":"What makes this place special is the salsa bar like none other.  Some are good on the complimentary chips; others are good with your order.  It's up to you to find out.  The oversized paintings reminiscent of Kahlo and Rivera adorn the walls.  Frida and Diego also appear in the pictures, and, yes, we're on a first name basis.  The restaurant was just about empty when we entered on a Friday night.  Hopefully, this was because it is new.  Pssst, you're missing out.  I had fish tacos and my Frida had some vegetarian dish.  Both of us were very happy.  They didn't have margaritas, just beer.  But I keep trying to order a margarita every time I go for good measure."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday !! Omg perfect .. Have the street tacos if you can't decide .. I had the cochinita pibil, al pastor and carne asada.. 

Loaded up at the salsa bar.. They have so many options and all were delicious.. Tried for the first time the strawberry salsa, which I drank like a shooter (yum!) and the jicama salsa was really good, you could eat this like a side salad, nice crunch!! 

Jamaica was served in a huge to go cup.. Thumbs up..

Get here early this place has a small dining area and it fills up fast !! Worth the wait though!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location .. it was chosen because of the vegan/ vegetarian options on the menu (and there are lots of items!!) .. truly something on the menu for everyone in the group..

Our drink order was taken care of right away and our food order was placed .. we waited a while for our food .. be prepared for a long wait and they weren't crowded or busy..

The food however when it arrives, is full of flavor and the portions are generous.

On today's visit I had the three taco plate with rice & beans.. the tacos are served with double tortilla, the filling has great flavor (the pickled onion although pretty to look at on top of the tacos did not compliment the tacos, way to acidic).

Try the salsa bar there are plenty of delicious options .."}
{"text":"Omg. Amazing! 
The food here is so rich and filling, i couldnt get it into my mouth fast enough.. i seriously was in heaven.. 

The salsa bar is to die for. All their salsas are amazing. Im a sucker for salsa that has a good garlic taste with a kick. These were perfect for my taste buds. I enjoyed EVERY single one! They are not overly spicey either where you can enjoy your food. Also you get free chips and you bet i got every single salsa to go with my chips and meal!

I ordered the asada street tacos. It came with rice and beans. They were AMAZING. Beans were rich and creamy, rice was salted perfectly. The meat was not fatty at all, which is huge for me because most resturants have such fatty asada. 

The place was decent and extremely clean. Artwork was amazing too. There seemed to only be one waitress in the whole resturant which was fine she was nice and attentive. The place is decently priced and well worth the food if you enjoy mexican. Honestly i wasnt even done with my meal and i was already plotting when to come back and tell everyone how good it was."}
{"text":"It was good but they only serve tacos, quesadillas, and burritos.  I did go with the fish tacos and they were very good.  My son had a steak burrito and was disappointed because it had beans in it.  He  considers beans a cheap filler to provide less meat and he said the beans ruined the flavor in his opinion."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Horrible service. Called in 4x to try to get a pick up order. No answer. Went in and informed the hostess who just brushed it off and handed me a menu. Took them 10 mins to take my order, which I already had in mind since it had be 20 mins after my first phone call which gave me plenty of time to make my food selection. 

After finally taking my order, the gentleman hands me back partial change and tells me that I have to wait for the rest of my change ($5). I was surprised because they were busy and as a professional establishment you should definitely have $5 change readily available. Gentleman said it would be 10-15 mins for my food to be ready. Took them 5 mins to get me the rest of my change. I filled salsas, brung them to my car and went back inside to wait for my food. There were 4 different couples waiting to be seated, looking extremely uncomfortable.  After overhearing one of them ask their partner \"Is this a bad joke?\" , I asked them how long they had been waiting...20 mins! There were plenty of tables open where these people could have been seated and had drinks at the least.

Finally got my food 35 mins later. If I was the owner, I would fire the hostess. Everyone else seemed to be TRYING to do their job. Seemed as though maybe she was trying to get fired with the way she was treating customers. 

Again; food is amazing...but this is my 3rd bad experience with customer service here."}
{"text":"Always good, always more than satisified! Get there when they open because it can get busy. The new expansion was a great move! Love everything about this place!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, it wasn't what I expected as they use different ingredients together (like pecans in the sangria or cranberries and mango in the guacamole). Everything was fresh and home made. The only thing lacking slightly was the service. They got a few things wrong, took awhile, and was a little slow. But it definitely wouldn't stop me from going back. Menu is very extensive and you can customize."}
{"text":"Really really slow service. The food was good. I recommend the oaxacana mile taco. I don't mind waiting for gourmet tacos (they post blunt signs warning \"we're making your gourmet tacos as fast as we can\") but I do mind waiting for water."}
{"text":"This place was extremely disappointing! 

After having some amazing fish tacos in SD, I wanted to find something here that would hold me over until my next trip. 
After reading the reviews for this place, I was sure this was going to be my spot. Oh how wrong I was! 

I got the shark and mahi mahi taco special with horchata. My friends got the white fish taco plate with that nasty ass red drink. 

Everything tasted so awful. I didn't even finish one of my tacos because I was so disgusted by it. My friends finished theirs but that's just because they were hungry. Afterwards, we all got sick from the food. 

Yuck, even thinking about it makes me want to vomit."}
{"text":"Was here 2 years ago. They've added a sit down bar. Interesting variety of unique salsa. Small place but not cramped. We all tried different tacos. Was fun ."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS tacos and a wide variety of salsa to choose from.  I LOVE the strawberry salsa. Restaurant is very clean. Staff is very friendly . Music is good. I would bring my family and friends  here. Definitely deserves five stars."}
{"text":"AVOID this place is dirty and has a bathroom smell as soon as you walk in... waited to be seated and the server said wait a minute and never approached. Waited 10 minutes- looked at the food and said forget it. Not up to par with the restaurants from Los Angeles at all. If I could give a negative start review I would."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE.  The food is good but the terrible service killed it for me.  It appears as though the waiter didn't know the menu very well!  Won't go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, everything on the menu is great and the decor is very nice. Lots of salsas to choose from."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food with a variety of delicious salsas at their salsa bar. Our favorite was the salsa pecan and the tomatillo salsa. Lots of taco options including a yummy veggie one with beer battered avocado. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"La Santisima, known in a past life as La Condesa, makes some of the best...THE BEST burritos and salsas in the valley. It looks like fast casual food, but it's a sit down restaurant that costs less than competitors while offering way higher quality eats. 

Like the 15+ varieties of salsa, ranging from a spicy, smoky chipotle to a light, creamy cilantro. Your food is going to take forever, so you might as well enjoy as many as you can. They all come across as very fresh--none of that canned crap. 

My burrito, the Gaucho, was up there with the best I've had. And I've had a LOT of burros. The grilled white cheese, rich steak that had a faint wine flavor, cucumbers, and some peppers. Amazing. Great! The portion was huge as well, and I could barely finish it. I have a HUGE appetite. 

The coolest part was that it was only around $9. That's somewhere between fast-casual and sit-down prices, but with better quality than virtually any Mexican restaurant. For about another $4 you can add some awesome aguas frescas like the horchata, complete with a touch of strawberry. I actually don't like that type of fruit infusion in something I expect to be straight up rice and cinnamon, but I can appreciate the quality ingredients. 

I'm sold on this place, and I definitely recommend you should go, but that doesn't mean I'm going to overlook a few flaws that irk me. The first is that I'm not sure the furniture is either comfortable, tasteful, or clean. The high wooden tables are much obliged for taller patrons like myself, but they were sticky...despite being actively cleaned as we walked in. Gross. The seats are shoddy as well. The airbrush-on-canvas Frida Kahlo paired with the \"no no THIS IS HOW MEXICAN FOOD IS DONE WE USE PROPER NAMES\" motif on the menu give this a unique, yet eyeroll-worthy vibe I can best describe as try-hard and totally hipster. 

Service is questionable as well. Although I appreciate that everyone who is not American actually takes their time at restaurants, I don't find anything particularly complex that warrants 20+ minutes for a burrito, and tacos/beans/rice for my dining partner. This is on top of the 10+ minutes it took to get a menu. We actually had to get up and grab them ourselves! They were not really paying attention. 

Oh yeah, and then there's the warm tap water. Gross. 

Anyway, Santisima comes across as a place with great cooks that don't know how to run a restaurant. I can't say I enjoyed any aspect of dining in besides salsa sampling, and so I've gotta deduct points even though that was a 5-star burrito. Fortunately, you can avoid these issues by just ordering something to go, which is probably what I'll gladly do when I undoubtedly return."}
{"text":"Authentic tacos. Wonderful flavors, and an awesome salsa bar...what else do you need?"}
{"text":"My most absolute favorite place to eat! The chicken quesadilla is my favorite and pairs the best with an ice cold Corona and a handful of different salsas to dip their awesome chips in. I love the cilantro salsa as well as the chipotle, but they are all so amazing! 
The quesadillas are huge and I always have leftovers even though I stuff myself because it's so tasty. 
This place is one you cannot pass up!"}
{"text":"Went there with the whole family cause it was nearby. We weren't expecting to walk out so satisfied, especially cause we're all so picky. Highly recommend the quesadillas. They're filled with Oaxaca cheese and flavorful meats/veggies, folded over fresh maza then fried. The salsa bar is colorful, unique, and spicy!!"}
{"text":"The salsa bar, the horchata, the veggie burrito, the fish burrito... SO GOOD. However, their tacos didn't do it for me (specifically the tortillas). Hey, can't win them all."}
{"text":"I work nearby and have tried this place for late lunch a few times. THE TACOS ARE A MUST. I've only ever ordered the 3 chicken tacos with rice and beans on the side, but it hasn't disappointed each time. The meat in the tacos are juicy, flavorful, and def hits the spot. And yes, the salsa bar is to die for, so definitely try these out if you visit! 

The service has been decent each time, although I do think they could do better with being attentive when refilling drinks and overall checking in on customers."}
{"text":"La Santisma was our first stop upon arriving in Phoenix. It was over 100 degrees outside and my family, bf and I were hungry. I was craving street tacos and found this place on Yelp! The Argentinian steak and the dog shark tacos were my favorites. The salsa bar was awesome as I laid out different types of salsa in front of my plate. The best part was sipping on a huge drink of horchata! I also admired the Mexican paintings on the walls. The restaurant was small, packed, busy and worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I have ever had the pleasure of eating at. Best burrito I have ever had!!! No joke I kept eating it because it was just that delicious and almost made myself sick. Please try!!!!"}
{"text":"the food was good, but not great. the horchata; however, is one of the best i've ever tried. i could come back just for that. 

the real reason why this place gets 2 stars instead of 3 was how the manager dealt with our issue. my friend ordered the filet mignon taco plate and the menu clearly said it was 15.99. We got our bill and it says 21.99. So we asked why and she said it's because they changed the menu. Well.. not the 4 menus that we were given. Instead of fixing it, she argued with us and tried to find a menu with the new price. when she couldn't produce one, she said she would need to call the owner blah blah. seriously?! and then she takes another 15minutes talking on the phone with the owner, I'm assuming, instead of dealing with her waiting customers. left such a bad taste in my mouth. in the end, she changed the charge to 15.99, to which i left a $6 tip and a scathing note on how they can have their money back. we will never return to this place."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place.  Shocking.  I LOVE this place.
Their quesadillas are doughy cheesy heaven.  HEAVEN.
Their tacos are the stuff dreams are made of.
Their salsa bar proof that there is a god.
Well, that may be much, but still, awesome place.
And guess what kiddies? They finally have beer!
Decor is nice, room is a bit small to contain all this awesomeness though.  Its cozy.
let me recommend  the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco.  That pork, tender, so very very tender.  Amazing in the quesa as well.
The dogfish shark and shrimp are great too. 
I haven't been disappointed yet actually.
Order one of everything! (maybe two of the pork)"}
{"text":"Awesome. 

This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. The food is amazing, I get the Taloc taco, it's vegan! The real shining star of this place is the salsa bar. Always a ton of options, all ranging in different levels of spice. Be careful, you might think the fruity one won't be spicy, but it'll surprise you :) 

The drinks are also good and reasonably priced. 

Always consistent, always good."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick street taco fix and what I found was La Santisima.  Calling it a gourmet taco shop is fitting and more importantly the price was right!

The list of Mexican restaurants and taco shops is endless in Phoenix and while I can't possibly try them all, I have at least found one I thoroughly enjoy.  From the quality of meat, to the portions, to the highly touted salsa bar, this place delivers on all levels!

I started with a half order of guacamole to compliment my assortment of chosen salsas.  Their guac tends toward the chunky side mixed with red onion, tomato, mango, and cilantro.  The chips were disappointing, but they served their purpose of sampling salsas and the guac.

I also heard great things about the horchata, which I can never pass up when available.  First of all, it comes in a massive 32 oz cup.  I would definitely share this with somebody else next time.  It's also loaded with strawberries and mangos, which I initially thought seemed unnecessary, but provided a unique twist.  The fruit proved difficult to fit through the straw, so maybe I'll order without in the future.

I ordered 3 of the gourmet tacos - El Gaucho Taco, Baja Sur Shark Taco, and Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco. All were $3.99 and excellent and I would say the Cochonita Pibil was the best I tried!  It went really well with the salsa cilantro, a cream based cilantro salsa."}
{"text":"Mouthwatering,  Flavorful, Love at first Taste, Insanely Good!!  

First, this place is super small but the wait is worth it. 
The salsa bar is Authentic Salsa!! 
I haven't tasted such great salsa till I came here. 
The horchata is Wow. 
The beans,  and rice, Tacos YUM! 
Price is just the icing on top 
Must try!"}
{"text":"I\"m feeling a little tepid about this place.  People just rave about how good the food is and so I expected to be totally wowed.  Not so.  We walked in around 7:00pm on a Saturday night and we were told it would be an hour wait.  Okay, we hunkered down for the long haul.  It was actually more like half an hour before we were shoehorned into a long table in the back room with a lovely view of the ladies room and what appeared to be a storeroom.  

The artwork is quite interesting and provides contrast to what otherwise appears to be a dining room transported out of a tiny village in Mexico.  It was hot and loud and being hearing impaired, mostly just a wall of indistinguishable sound.  Our server was nice and efficient, getting margaritas for the others and for me, as the DD, iced tea.  There was one tiny corner of a wedge of lemon in my tea, but fortunately, the well-appointed salsa bar had more.

Speaking of the salsa bar, that was the highlight for me.  The first time I've ever had a strawberry-chile salsa and it was delicious.  I had several of the mini-cups with the abundant and fresh tortilla chips.  I also had a peanut salsa that tasted like a sambal, but with a nice, slow burn.  Again, a very tasty salsa.  There were about ten other salsas and they all appeared fresh and very popular. 

The menu is like a regional loop through Mexico, and I found that very cool.  There were regional specialties with a local twist like Mole, Tinga, Cochinita Pibil, and fish tacos.   There was also a variety of vegetarian/vegan options that appealed to the veggies in my group.  I couldn't stray from a \"burro norteno\" that was a combination of beans, rice, potato and green chile pork.  I wish there was more green chile pork in it, and it was a bit dry, but flavorful.

Yeah, I plan to go back some night with my wife who is a vegetarian, and perhaps something will trigger that spark so that I can rave about it like everybody else."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the smoked Marlin burrito and the La Samita taco with shrimp.

The waiter was pretty awesome, he brought us samples of the different meats to make our ordering process much simpler. The salsas were great. The tomatia salsa was my favorite. The strawberry salsa was surprisingly good as well. 

All in all a great experience for $20 with tip. The burrito was enough to eat without the taco but the two together we're very filling."}
{"text":"Tried them on a whim in passing by today, it was just ok. .my carne was well seasoned and flavorful,  my pork was horrible, they screwed my order up only to correct it...then when i got home I realized it was still screwed up...

My total for 3 tacos, small rice & beans came to $14 and some change, I don't think it was quite worth that but i may be inclined to try them again - at someone else's expense. I'm a little salty that I didnt check groupon before going lol."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here as I'd heard good things but was mostly disappointed.  Their horchata was really good but that was about it. They didn't allow us to order a side of just beans and rice for our kids which I found strange and I ordered 2 horchatas, 1 for me and 1 for my kids to share. They brought the kid's out in 2 separate tiny cups; not even close to half of a full serving and still charged us for a full size! I ordered tacos with beef brisket and the meat was dry and chewy.  In the end I was dissatisfied with their food and service."}
{"text":"I read alot of reviews and had very high expectations of this place. The food was good but nothing that made me say \"WOW\". Out of the 4 tacos that I tried, the CABO shrimp taco was the best and would return for it.  The salsas and chips are a good way to down down some beers before your meal. I'd say give La Santisima a try and make your own decision."}
{"text":"Sometimes, Yelp is right on.  I was looking for a great Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood to take my wife to (it was date night).  This place had far more stars than most, so we gave it a go.

Upon entering (we visited on First Friday last month) it was so loud that it was like bombs going off.  The decor was unusual and had an interesting botanica vibe going on.  Service was a bit slow but they were so packed that I wasn't surprised.

Their salsa bar had more flavors than I've ever seen at a restaurant anywhere--and I've been to a lot of Mexican Restaurants.  As for the food itself, there was nothing \"traditional\" about it, but everything was so bursting with incredible flavor that I was savoring every bite.

Holy sh*t, that was good.  My burrito was loaded with CHUNKS of marinated steak--not ground, not shredded, but chunks.  I was blown away.  Next time, there's a SHARK burrito on the menu that I can't wait to taste.

If you're in the mood for something \"traditional\", I still point people to Mi Patio in Phoenix.  However, if you're looking for something other than the same old Mexican taste, may I recommend this landmark.  It's just a few blocks north of McDowell on your right hand side.  You won't regret it.  The place is small and can sometimes be packed with noisy gringos, but the taste is unforgettable."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Place was small and it took me a while to figure out that we had to order at the bar.  After paying for our meal, we enjoyed the salsa bar, then out of one of the black t-shirts a roach comes out and was about to get on another woman who was leaning on the wall.  I immediately informed her and they left.  I just sat there and pondered whether or not to eat the rest of my tacos, they were good after all.. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This salsa bar will ruin your life. You will lay in bed awake at night thinking about the salsa combinations you didn't try and how your life is not as fulfilled as it could be if you had tried it... The food here will change you life for the best and for the worst (cause you'll want it all the time)."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! First time there and I had the Oaxacan Mole Quesadilla and my friend had the Pastor quesadilla and they were both delicious!!! I also recommend the margaritas! They had orange and grapefruit juice!"}
{"text":"It is a little confusing when you walk in, but you do seat yourself and a server comes over with menus and chips. Help yourself to the wide variety (about 20) of salsas @ the salsa bar and your server will come take your order. I got the cochinita pibil tacos and my husbannd got the carne asada tacos...we got the combo plates with rice and beans, 2 tacos for $6.99. I don't know where that person has been eating who said this was expensive...the plates (baskets) come looking a little plain, but you have all those salsas to add to your tacos which makes it fun and filling! Rice and beans quantity was a little small for my husband, but just right for me.
The carne asada tacos were good, but the cochinta pibil were amazing! I love the artwork and the tables and chairs...it's a great place! Plastic cutlery is a turn off, but who cares when the food is so good. I like La Condesa more than America's! *ducking behind the sofa*"}
{"text":"Great food! Reminded me of my time in Oaxaca! Wish they had silverware because the plastic ware made cutting the Quesa tough lol but so small in the grand scheme of a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food!  Awesome food!  Out of this world great food. Service is spotty. Great guy that works weekdays, but otherwise the service is terrible doesn't matter which female it is. Getting food before drinks. Sometimes order food before drinks. Tonight the drink arrived 2 seconds before the meal, my taco was incorrect (I don't complain just go with it). Then they are all over us asking if all is ok. Then clean our table, working at pushing us out the door because they close in 15 min. 

Again great food, worth all my trips there (10+) but don't ever expect exceptional service unless you luck out and get the male server, he is good!"}
{"text":"I want to say don't go here... Why? Because my wife and I loved it so much on our first visit to La Condesa that we selfishly want to keep it a secret from others.

The food was really good and such a unique sampling of traditional Mexican food dishes, with a twist.  The mole was to die for and the shark tacos were amazing.  The rice is also so tasty and I am not usually a rice kind of guy.  I always forgo ordering the traditional side of rice & beans and initially I did the same on our visit.  But my wife ordered the rice with her meal and after seeing and tasting hers, I actually added that to my order even though we already had received our food.  Everyone has already mentioned the amazing salsa bar so I won't repeat the accolades other than to say what a journey of amazing and unique concoctions, coupled with a few of the standard salsas.  Have to recommend the cilantro salsa if you go and be prepared to order more chips if you want to take the salsa adventure and try them all!!!

Gets pretty packed during the standard rush hour periods but worth the wait and if you plan accordingly (noon or early dinner meal), you can avoid the surge.  Definitely one of my favorite taco places in Phoenix.

Ray"}
{"text":"Really great salsa bar, tacos, quesadillas and burros.  Service is hit or miss depending on how busy they are but are very friendly.  Just get the food ala carte, the beans and rice portions with a combo are small and aren't that great.  Not a very good selection of beers and the regular margarita is just so so."}
{"text":"Best bean & cheese burrito in town!  And, the salsa bar is fantastic!  Try the pecan salsa... Its delicious on everything!  Sometimes the servers seem unorganized/overwhelmed so, you'll need to be patient."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I had wonderful service. The gal who took my order was so sweet. I order a carne Asada and horchata! Yummmy! Literally the best tacos I have ever had in Phoenix and the horchata has a little surprise inside!"}
{"text":"Truly an amazing Mexican restaurant! The salsa bar is the winning touch with over 12 different unique salsa for every taste. First time here so I had to try the tacos. The chicken and steak were marinated wonderfully and the flavors combine well. It was definitely worth it. They have great vegetarian/vegan options too! Cannot wait to come back and try the other options on the menu."}
{"text":"Was very excited to come here after all the good reviews.   Overall, our experience was quite \"meh\".  The menu was inspired.  I loved the idea of having a taco to represent the cuisine of so many different latin american places.  I also loved the salsa bar with its dozen or so unlimited salsas.  However, the food its self was nothing to write home about.  We tried six different tacos, and none of it seemed particularly fresh or interesting.  Had to rely heavily on the salsas to revive the tired tacos.  Doubt I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Do like to try new salsas? Do you love Mexican food?? Well then this restaurant is the store for you. I came upon this hidden gem by mistake, what drew me in was the nice piece of art of a lady on the front of the restaurant. Walking in it's very small but, don't let that discourage you from eating there. Starting of they have different types of salsas the peanut salsa, pecan salsa, and many more. First I thought ewww peanut and pecan salsa?? I was so wrong don't judge a book by it's cover the salsas where delicious! I ordered the shark tacos omg they where yummy I was licking my fingers lol and didn't care who saw I was happy enjoying my plate. With the plate came beans and rice, the rice was moist and soft. One thing have to applaud is the lady that was our server I totally should of asked for her name she needs to be recognized on top of being a friendly employee she also has integrity. Let me explain, so I basically ate and left on my way home I was looking for my most precious thing ugh oh my cell phone where is it?? We all know that scary sad feeling. To make things short I went back to the restaurant and who was there at the cashier greeting me with a smile and raising my phone up high the wonderful employee! So YES I totally recommend going here the restaurant, the employees, and even the food totally 5 stars."}
{"text":"WOW! Visiting in Phoenix so visited Yelp for a restaurant recommendation. La Santisima was the winner and I couldn't be moe pleased with my meal! You MUST try the Shrimp Taco! It is fabulous!! I will definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"We were really excites to try this place from the other reviews. Unfortunately, we didnt really get to try it. We showed up and there were only a few other customers. 6 or so tables were open and three or four still had food sitting. They asked us to wait 5 min before seating us but it was 20. Then we ordered tacos....after waiting an hour from ordering we decided to leave. We did have a single coke and a very small bowl of guac. This cost us $12. The food that came out to customers after us ( some who had gotten there a full 30 minutes after us) did look wonderful. The guac was tasty. Our server basically avoided us the entire time. Im just so disappointed."}
{"text":"Drove by it the first time due to major remodeling on outside building , small and quaint inside - many salsas to choose from for your chips ( additional chips are $2.40 a basket) Street tacos were excellent , one person in our party said the retries beans were the best they ever had . Good  quick service even thou every table in the place was taken."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing tacos here.  The best part is that you can order tacos a la carte, so you can try several types in one meal.  There is an option to do a taco llate, two tacos with a small side of rice and beans.  I'd skip this option.  The sides were quite small.  If you're hungry go for another taco or perhaps a side of chips and explore the free salsa bar.

You must order at the register.  You are given a number so they can bring out your food.  This is all fine and dandy until you have to find a table.  La Santisima is quite small and has very few tables inside.  We had to stand, basically hovering over people who were eating, and leap at the first table to open up.  I'd say it would be obvious to follow etiquette and let those who ordered before you grab a table first, but we all know not everyone is that poliet.  

They do offer to-go orders if you don't want to wait for a table. I'd also recommend that La Santisima invest I outdoor seating to aleviate some of the indoor congestion.  I'll keep my fingers crossed for my next visit."}
{"text":"Busy hole in the wall restaurant that exceeds expectations in several areas. Salsa Bar is quite impressive w array of choices especially the 7 chile salsa which stood out.
The Shark Taco & Ghandi were fine, nothing special in my opinion. Shredded pork my friend ordered was seasoned out standingly, will try that next time. Salsa bar lived up & exceeded reviews as the well decorated & tasty Horchata"}
{"text":"Dear La Condesisima or whoever you are now...I don't need to add to the already glowing reviews of your food, I love it and hope you stay around forever (especially your chile oil...I could drink that stuff).

In fact, I love it so much that I frequently crave it on my way home from work....but I am almost always thwarted by the fact that no one ever answers the phone to take my order. I'm not going to stop and wait for you to take and make my order when I'm trying to bring dinner home to my kids, I just want to order over the phone so I can walk in and pick it up. 

Please answer your phone so I can spend my money at your place.

(unless you're trying to discourage take-out orders, in which case please tell me so I can stop getting my hopes up when the craving strikes!) 

Thanks!"}
{"text":"All I can say is SALSA BAR. I love this place. A little bit expensive for a taco place, but I'm not complaining. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants fresh authentic tacos"}
{"text":"The good:
The tacos here are amazing. Best I've ever had? No. But enjoyable, if pricey. I had the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco and the La Condesa Veggie Taco. The pork taco was tasty, though extremely messy; the onion pieces were huge, but weirdly enough they had no flavor at all. My favorite was the veggie taco. The vegetable variety was great and they were all cooked to perfection--crisp but fully cooked. The cheese on top was like the glue (best glue ever!) and had a lovely salty tang.

My husband had the pork taco as well and also the Sonoran Carne Asada Taco. The steak taco was his definite favorite; he thought the pork chunks were way too big.

Our server was good--much better than when I visited the Glendale location by myself and was ignored.

The bad:
Yes, the salsa bar is great, but the restaurant is so crowded that it makes getting the salsa difficult. The restaurant is downright claustrophobic, and it wasn't even fully packed with customers when we were there. We wanted to finish our food and leave ASAP so we could stretch out and breathe. There's not a great deal of parking, either.

The tacos are served in baskets lined with tissue paper. With really messy tacos, that means the paper disintegrates and you can't easily cut big chunks of meat with a knife.

Really, it's a place with great tacos and a horrid location. We won't visit again."}
{"text":"My experience here left me willing to try it again, though it didn't live up to expectations.

I came in by myself at dinner time. I was promptly seated and provided with chips. The server was by herself handling the entire dining room and bar at supper, and as a solo diner, I was last priority. It took me all of two minutes to choose what I wanted--a single taco--but it took fifteen minutes for my order to be taken. If I hadn't been given the chips, I would have given up and left. In the meantime, I saw people who came in after me get complete service because they ordered drinks.

The chips were excellent--very fresh. I like the salsa bar but the lighting was poor back there so it was hard to see what was what.

Finally a male server joined her and he took my order. My Aztec chicken tinga taco came out about five minutes later. It was excellent. The chicken was very tender and tasty. Just the right about of spice. It only took about five minutes to catch the server's eye and soon enough I was on my way."}
{"text":"Delicious street tacos. Chicken asado was very tasty. The salsa bar was fun to try the different kinds.

Servers/ staff was polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Sometimes you buy a groupon and then you accidentally don't use it your first try.  So you come back.  That happens.  It happened.

With my two visits to La Santisima, I'd say they know what they're doing.  The offer some dishes that were new to me.  Lonches, for one.  I know what lonche is in Spanglish practice, but what_a_ lonche is, was news to me.  And it was good news.  All around, the food was good.  Salsas are even better.

I did order horchata my first time...but I've totally forgotten what that was like.  That seems to have happened to much of what happened during my first year on the job.  This isn't the only thing I've forgotten.  I've blocked out a lot, apparently.

The service was fine.  I've never seen the place hoping, but maybe the weekend dinner crowd is bashful or something.  Our water cups stayed pretty full and our server was otherwise attentive.  The wait for food was never long.

Cost was fine. It is a gourmet taco shop, after all, so you get what you pay for.  Portions are not huge and style comes with a cost.  The decor is lovely.  I could steal some of their paintings for home, I like them so much.  That is, if they weren't so darn big.

I'd likely give it another visit, that is if we're in Glendale downtown, just walking around, or something.  It seems to be one of the best options."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Can't say enough good things about this restuarant! The set up is nice and the art work is superb! A great place to go have a date night or a quiet family dinner. The food is always fresh, (highly recommended the el pastor quesadilla!!) 

The only thing negative per se about this place is the service. They really need another waiter. I give respect to the guy that works there solo, but he's so busy hustling and bustling that it's hard for him to give adequately good service when he's rushing through our orders. We have been there 3 times and each time it is the same, 4 or 5 tables and we end up waiting 20 minutes to get a drink order.

I love the atmosphere and food too much to stop going, just hope they hire another waiter in the near future!!

Definitely recommend this place to others!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing tacos. This place has the best tacos in town. Great value great quality. Very very impressed. Can't wait to go there again."}
{"text":"We spent a few days in Scottsdale a week ago . We ate at few restaurants that were recommended in Scottsdale and we were not happy with them at all . Our last day in Arizona I went on a search myself and found this little gem . I had the tacos Sonora . My husband had the 3 kinds of tacos . It all was very delicious !! We loved all the Salas's they had . 

You need to go off the beaten path to have good food and I totally recommend this restaurant. 

The service was also good!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times! The food is great and I haven't ever had a complaint. Today I came in for just a side of guac and was surprised by a 7 dollar charge. Of course being $7 I thought it was going to be big, right? I'm given the tiniest scoop! I asked for a refund and they told me they could not and refused to do anything about it l: won't be coming back sadly!"}
{"text":"Best Cadillac margarita I've had in all of Phoenix. The place would be dazzling with a patio and more seating, but even without I'm sold on the food and definitely the drinks. I had the Santisima special quesadilla, which should not be named something so bland and unremarkable as a quesadilla; it was the demi-god of quesadillas, more of an empanada, the hercules of Mexican food; it could beat up your dad is what I'm saying, unless your dad is really old then it would help him out of his chair and bring all the salsa options to the table to give his old bones some rest."}
{"text":"Other than the fact that I should have brushed up on my Rosetta Stone Spanish Edition before trying to find La Condessa I can honestly say I haven't had better tacos in PHX. 
The place is a little hard to find if it's your first time so after multiple turn arounds and a stop at the Panaderia to ask for directions my colleague and I arrived at taco bliss. 

The meal starts off with an endless bowl of fresh tortilla chips and a salsa bar that would make Bobby Flay  jealous. They had some of the best homemade salsas with a large variety. From your classic Pico De Gallo to a Creamy Cilantro salsa. 

I ordered the two taco platter with a tinga taco and a carne asada Taco. These were both great. The carne asada was a little dry for my taste but with the assist of the homemade salsa's it was a perfect combo. The tinga taco was a perfect combination of slowly cooked shredded chicken and seasoning. My colleague got a carne asada burrito and a tinga taco and was satisfied by both. 

In short if I am looking for a great taco for a good price I am going back to La Condesa."}
{"text":"Every once in a while yelp is just flat out wrong and that is the case with la santisima taco shop.  Every review makes you think it will be amazing, but the reality is that the food is ok, but there are much better places to eat in Phoenix.  

So what is wrong with this place?  First off, what the heck kind of quesadilla are the making?  I am still not sure.  Why fry a tortilla and throw some cheese in the middle, it just doesn't make any sense to me.  I love quesadillas, but this one was not good.

Second, the \"carne asada\" was not good.   It just didn't have much flavor.  The only burrito that I liked was the shrimp burrito, although I didn't realize that it had mushrooms in it, which was disappointing. 

The salsa bar is very good.  The tortilla chips are ok.  The location leaves a little bit to be desired and so does the food.  

I am sure many will go to this place based on yelp, but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Amazing salsa,  seriously. This place has redefined delicious Mexican food for me.  Great music,  great ambiance, great drinks,  great food."}
{"text":"This definitely takes the cake for one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. The diverse salsa bar and extensive menu allow for a lot of taste-testing, and the restaurant seems to be known for its many vegetarian options. I ordered the tacos al pastor, and they were some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Oh wow!!! This place was amazing. The staff was very understaffed even though there were only about 9 tables but you could tell the waiter was trying very hard. We started out with a strawberry marg, which was okay, the lime one was much better. Excuse me while I write the rest of the review... I can't remember each plates name... We got the steak quesadilla stuffed with avocado, peppers, onions, etc... I thought to myself this might be my favorite thing I've ever had... We then ordered 4 tacos to split. I wasn't the biggest fan of any of them besides the white fish! The shark, and steak tacos were very good but the quesadilla you couldn't be satisfied with tacos... Last final thing.... We ordered the burrito to split (yes we took half of it home). We got the steak burrito stuffed with all the good stuff! WOW - I thought okay this might be better than the quesadilla but close call. Must try place in AZ."}
{"text":"Decent to good food but expect to wait and wait lol if I was only rating on service I would rate them a 1 star. I have been 3 times and I'm done !"}
{"text":"Honestly, love this place. The Yelp reviews don't lie. I can't get over La Santisma's  salsa variety. I literally had to dig into my memory to remember what I even ate here because I was so amazed by the salsa bar. I literally got up and filled containers nonstop with EVERY single salsa (no shame). I didn't let that go to waste, I tried them all and left little behind. Of course, I loved the spicier selections, but everything was amazing. After eating so much salsa, my pastor burrito came and was pretty good. I think it was a little dry, but nothing salsa can't fix. I tried some of Eric's shark taco and carne asada taco, those were really good! Next time I think I'm going to give a carne asada quesadilla a try! The beans were also great and I must say I left full and satisfied!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a few days ago and it was great. Food was delicious and the margaritas are even better! Service was a little slow but nothing too bad, still very nice and polite. also very affordable which is great!"}
{"text":"Poor service, took over an hour to get burritos, freezing air conditioning blowing right on us, sound system not working just crackling loudly the whole time. They charge 5$ more just to get sour cream and enchilada sauce on burrito."}
{"text":"I went to La Santisima for the first time when a friend took me here for lunch. I have been here about a dozen times since then!This place was on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, so there is a lot of hype around this place, and trust me, it's real!

La Santisima has a superb menu with a big variety of items to pick from. Their tacos are delicious and they have a great Aztec Tinga taco. The quesadillas are huge, I can only eat about half when I get it.

They offer a large salsa bar that has at least 10 different salsas ranging from spicy to mild flavors. 

They offer a house margarita for $5 that is delicious, I get about two when I come hehe.They have a small bar but the drink offering is big, including Mexican beers. 

Service is friendly, fast, and courteous. 6-7 PM seems to be a peak time for this restaurant, so make sure you're here on time to get a table since it's a bit small and can fill up quick!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican places in Arizona.  Always fresh food and very tasty. I normally get the steak taco combo with rice and beans.  Lots of salsas to choose from and usually pretty busy inside.  Would come here more often if it wasn't a 25 minute drive from where I live."}
{"text":"Well we went back just to check and, sure enough, this is still the best mexican food we've ever had.  My taco with pork cooked in a banana leaf was uh-mA-zing.  And the margarita was too.  I think I just gained five pounds."}
{"text":"stoped by on yelp to see whats near found this place...never did i think it would be this good....i will totaly recommend it will be back"}
{"text":"Food was decent, salsa bar was grate! But let's face it folks, this place is a dump. The bathrooms were disgusting. Smells like methane gas, giant holes exposing past plumbing problems and no way to dry your hands. The wife said the woman's bathrooms were the same. The service wasn't the best and the kitchen was quite filthy.  Overpriced food, warm beer ( which they ran out of), $9.99 for salsa to go, but they had no containers. Woke up the next morning with severe diarrhea!!"}
{"text":"La Condesa, you stole my heart.  Gourmet Taco Shop indeed.  Your saucy molé put me over the top.

You really know how to spice up a relationship with your many wonderful salsas.

I loved your warm decor and warmer service.

I can't wait to come back to sample your salsas and try more tacos.

I finally made my way here to meet some friends on a trip to Phoenix about a month ago, then I met another friend here on my most recent trip.

$3.99 gourmet street tacos.  Filling.  20 or so salsas.  Delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, hands down!! An amazing variety of different salsas and they have a very unique horchata with fruits and nuts!! Come here, you won't regret it!! The only bad thing I can say about this place is limited seating, but it's worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"The food is INCREDIBLE. Best burro I have ever had! The service, on the other hand, was pretty bad. This was this past Sunday afternoon. It was busy, but we had to wave down a waiter to even get drinks.

I will always come back, because the food is absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"I am always looking for an authentic mexican cuisine experience and this place is up there with the best. Some of the best salsas I've ever had, the 5/7 chile salsa is amazing if you like a little heat in your life."}
{"text":"First time at this Taco haven.  Simple and funky spot with unique combinations, flavors and choices.   A definite stop for Mexican food.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for La Condesa, but it quickly turned to La Confusión. The three of us went in during the week for a late lunch, salivating at the thought of some tasty tacos. We each ordered a different  taco combo plate, one Aztec Tinga, one Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken,  one Baja Sur Dogfish Shark, and a quesadilla. 
After waiting a significant amount of time, the waitress brought out our quesadilla and one combo plate with one Aztec Tinga taco and one Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken taco. Despite going over our order numerous times with our server and another gentlemen, somehow, what we wanted seemed beyond comprehension. They brought out the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark taco combo plate and, after waiting so long and confusion over our order, we gave up and ate what we had.
The Azteca Tinga was superb. The Oaxaca Black Mole was good. The Baja Sur Dogfish wasn't really any better than your average fish taco. The rice is a white rice that had decent flavor and the same can be said for the flavor of the refried beans.
La Condesa has a great salsa bar, a cozy interior decorated with some great Día de los Muertos art. The staff was nice and friendly, despite the fact our order remained so elusive.
But, after the ordeal with our order and the less than stellar meal, I have to say that La Condesa was an utter disappointment."}
{"text":"Great service- server was friendly and attentive. Small place, will probably have to wait if you could at a typical busy lunch or dinner time. Food was on point, even a few options for vegetarians! Good sized portions, not overly pricey. Love having the salsa bar there!! The jicama drink was similar to a berry juice, was a little too sweet for my liking but once it was watered down a little, it was delicious. Will definitely come back here next time!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best tacos I've had in Phoenix (i was spoiled living in San Diego). I ordered the 3 Al Pastor street tacos with rice and beans, for my daughter we got the Pollo asada tacos with rice and beans and she sure enjoyed it! Normally she is very picky about onions but she sure enjoyed them from here. They have a large selection of salsas to choose from but there were only a couple that I was fond of, a lot of them seemed to have some weird mixtures but to each their own ? I would recommend this place if you're looking for tacos here in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"What a great place!  Good food that is very reasonably priced, and more types of salsa than I've ever seen before.  Our group had a lot of fun going up to the salsa bar, and bringing back samples of the huge selection for everyone to try.  I'd go back there in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for lunch with a co-worker and I'm obsessed.  First thing you notice is their huge salsa bar in the corner -- looks like they always have about 8-10 different kinds to try.  My favorites: strawberry, pecan and cilantro.  The whole place is decorated with Dia de los Muertos art everywhere -- very colorful and authentic.  Next...the meals.  So far I've had the shrimp burro and some of my co-workers chicken mole quesa.  Both were absolutely delicious -- melty fresh cheese, the mole sauce was unbelievable, and the shrimp burro was a great mix of cheese, an assortment of vegetables and a yummy sauce.  If this place was closer to my house I'd be there way more!"}
{"text":"Great place for delicious Mexican. Had the 3 tacos plate and half order of guacamole and was all really fresh and authentic. Salsa bar is great and the salsa verde is some of the best I've had in years ( Shout out to Dos Coyotes in Davis, CA). Love that it's a small off the beaten path location and even though I was interested because of Guy I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by as we made our way though Phoenix along our road trip. Was very excited and had my hopes up for a delicious Mexican meal. Decided on their taco combination plate which is a order of 3 tacos along with beans and rice. Salsa bar was pretty good as we're their chips. Unfortunately their rice was awful, was overcooked and microwaved to a large glob of paste. Honestly it was unappetizing to have it on my plate as it made me think that the rest of the meal was also microwaved. Made a comment to the waiter as I felt it could be a point of improvement. He received the criticism well. 

Don't think this restaurant is deserving of a four star based on my experience."}
{"text":"The street tacos were delicious and we had fun sampling the different types of salsa. This food has f-l-a-v-o-r.... there is definitely a  reason this place is busy!!"}
{"text":"Everything is good. And hands down best salsa bar imaginable. Best, best, best! Small and always crowed though, which I blame mostly on the awesomeness salsa bar.... Did I mention how great the salsa bar here is?"}
{"text":"Slow roasted pork burros!!!"}
{"text":"Really good tacos!!! Love the multiple choices of salsa!!!!  The protein style taco was crazy!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of my Nana's (Grandma's) home cooking.  For instance, when you order a carne asada burrito... it doesn't look like your typical fast foot burrito... which is great.  You truly get a more authentic Mexican feeling here.  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Yeah this place is really good. The food is definitely worth the wait and all the other negative bs people write on here."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic!  Service always stinks.  Will keep coming back though.  Food is too good:)"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food I've ever had! Al Pastor is amazing and all the salsas in the salsa bar taste great! Get the Cadillac Margarita, super good on the rocks."}
{"text":"The food gets a solid five. Service a 3-3 1/2. Service wasn't bad, it was just busier than I think they expected. It's small, and a bit crowded, but worth it.

This was my second visit. This time I had the molé quesa.  OH MY GOODNESS! Amazing.  It was so big I had to take half home. 

The salsa are great. Love the creamy cilantro salsa and the strawberry salsa. Try the guacamole with mangoes."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that there is a La Santisima near me now. Although not very large, this location isn't nearly as cramped as the original location, and overall, the service was much better! The food was as tasty as the original location. I had the mole quesa and my husband had the al pastor quesa. Both were delicious. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, and I am deciding is my favorite Mexican food restaurant (restaurants-both locations are pretty much the same) in the Phoenix area. I have eaten here (and at the Glendale location) a total of 4 times, and each experience has left me wanting to come back. 

The salsa bar is the best I've experienced with an amazing variety of tastes, fresh ingredients, and mild to moderate spice. Order extra chips straight away if you love chips and salsa.

The food is outstanding-from their pibil to their arbol, to their beans and rice. They use very high quality fresh ingredients with KILLER flavor and spice. While there is a very strong Mexican feel to the restaurants (no gringo influence that I noticed-Thank you), there is also a modern feel to their menu. So I've started out with the more popular dishes/recipes, but I am excited to try out some of their other offerings that appear more modern.

Their margaritas (I've only had the house) are the best, period. End of sentence.

Finally, you should be aware that the physical spaces are pretty different. I'm going to guess the owners are young and without the resources to afford something more expensive. But don't be put off by the space. I love that they have more modern art, and the food more than makes up for any misgivings one might have about the space.

If you really love Amazing Mexican food, you must try this place. I can't imagine you will be disappointed.

PS, I don't think their prices are reasonable/not expensive."}
{"text":"If you come to Phoenix and don't eat here you are missing out on life!!!! I have never had Mexican food like this. I had the shark taco and a Marlin burrito!!!! Life changing is not a bold enough statement. I'm a foodie and this place is incredible. Please come here!!!!!!  The salsa bar alone is worth the visit. It is cheap in price only. Everything about the place is magical. It looks a little scary from outside and at night the sign is not lite up but we took a chance, and it was one of the best choices in eatery I've ever made. Salsa Guacamole is to die for!!! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING LA SANTISIMA!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If a place in Phoenix has almost 500 reviews and it still has almost 5 stars, you know it has to be good. I came here for a quick lunch after work one day, and couldn't have been more pleased with my experience. The fish tacos I ordered were absolutely delicious, and the staff was very friendly. The salsa bar is genius! So many different flavors, it's like having 10 different dishes in one. 

Overall, do yourself a favor and try Santisima if you're in the mood for Mexican."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service! Love the guacamole. The lighting outside the restaurant is not so good, so we passed the place twice. Once inside, everything we ordered was great! Tacos with mole, El Pastor tacos, steak tacos and - did I mention - guacamole! A must do in Phoenix. Go now!"}
{"text":"Dear Arizona,

Over 1.5 years ago, I visited your state and ate at a Mexican restaurant that I neither remember the name nor want to. It was awful. And I reviewed that restaurant and commented that a place so highly reviewed in Arizona must have meant people in Arizona don't get food. I was wrong. So wrong. And for that, I apologize. After visiting la Santisima (a different restaurant than the above mentioned disaster), I realized you guys have got the Mexican food down to a T.

Your Midwestern friend,
-Deena

Okay now for the review:
We were in town for a wedding and we had a lot of time between the wedding and our arrival so we looked up some good places to eat. Thank GOD for yelp because it helped us find this holy landmark of Mexican food. 

Atmosphere: 3.5/5. Small restaurant. You will definitely wait so get there early. Nice paintings around. Modern American music playing which is fine by me. You don't need to play mariachi music for the place to be authentic. If your food is this good, I don't care if you play Beyoncé or sounds of the Amazon. 

Food: fresh corn tortillas. Fresh chips. Guacamole with chunks of avocado so ripe it melts in your mouth. Salsa with fresh peppers. Mole so good it could only be holy. Fish and shrimp tacos as well as \"shark\" tacos that melt like butter !! Horchata with fresh fruit and cinnamon and nuts. Oh my gosh. Never ending food ecstasy here. I wish I had an extra stomach so I could have ordered more food to try before I left this place. 

Service: they are a limited number of servers but they bust their humps walking around serving , taking orders , etc. Five stars to them! 

Miscellaneous: limited parking out front. They take all credit cards except American Express. 

PROS: great food and memorable flavors
CONS: can't think of any"}
{"text":"Our group arrived a few minutes early.  We spent a few minutes talking with a bartender.  He explained a bit about the restaurant and made some recommendations.  We spent a few minutes admiring the artwork that adorned the walls throughout the restaurant.  

This is really a homey sort of small place, but the variety of choices is impressive.  A large variety of tacos and tortas are the main choices.  Fish, shrimp, chicken, beef and pork are protein choices for Oaxacan mole, Tinga, chipotle, Sonoran and several other flavorings.  
The black mole is a standout.  Slightly sweet with a strong earthy flavor - it was a favorite at our table.   

The salsa bar has close to a dozen different choices for chipping/dipping and adding to some of the tacos.

My order of Grilled Calabacitas fell a bit short.  You usually don't order this unless you really like it.  Only a few rounds (8-10) of thinly cut zucchini served on a large platter.  A smaller plate would have made these tasty morsels seem like more but actually, more would have made it seem like more!

One of our group is a perfectionist and was put-off by the chipped terracotta plates and platters used as serving pieces.  They seemed very at home with the restaurant's decor.  Mine was scraped clean of any extra bits.  Service was quick and efficient.  They may have been a bit understaffed but our group of six had no complaints."}
{"text":"Ohhh baby the horchata is simply amazing. 5th star well deserved. I felt like a little kid scooping the pecans and strawberries with a spoon at the end."}
{"text":"Great!  But long lines and crowded.  Huge servings, lots of tasty choices.  Salsa bar is varied and delicious."}
{"text":"The place is amazing. And it's REAL Mexican food. Don't be fooled by that la piñata bs. Do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"Everything was terrific! The salsa bar had huge variety. Had the Condesa Mahi Mahi tacos, and the veggies were fresh and perfectly cooked. We had a huge party, 8 moms and 10 kids under the age of 5. (We had just toured Stuffington Bear Factory and we are a very rowdy hungry crew). They treated us wonderfully and service was exceptional. All the moms raved about the food. Next time we visit we need to leave the kids at home ;-)"}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere complimented by wide variety of free salsa. Reasonable prices and pleasant service. Food is great!"}
{"text":"Authentic?  First, we were hoping the tortilla were homemade (likely not).  I ordered a pork/tomato/onion \"not a\" torta, and it was most certainly a sandwich with mustard and mayonnaise??  That didn't seem authentic.  But I ate the thing- it was good.  But I would get tacos or a burrito next time... if there is one.  DUN DUN DUNN!

MILEY, WHAT'S GOOD?
The salsa bar is great... though the best ones (\"guacamole\") were empty the Friday lunch hour I went.  Chunky pico is good.  Strawberry salsa?  Um ok.  Peanut salsa.  Sure.  Cilantro salsa- tasted more like bell pepper to me.  Hit and miss, but fun to try them all regardless.  

DRINKS?
Skinny margarita so watery my wife switched the beer. But the iced tea is good and comes in a big 32 ounce cup so you don't have to bother anyone for refills.  And you get your own water bottle. 

Kinda of a fun, dark, (maybe too) little dive w/ good service.  Would be greater if they could extend the bar to more than three seats."}
{"text":"I still love this place. A lot. Perhaps even more so now that I can walk there from my apartment. One thing I forgot to mention in my last review is their fantastic margaritas, which have squeezes from fresh orange or grapefruit, pack a punch and are very cheap ($6) for the size. 

I know I said I'm not much of a \"regular,\" but La Condesa has made me one. Spectacular."}
{"text":"Top Mexican food in Phx
Try the peanut butter salsa."}
{"text":"This place has the best horchata!!!!! You have to try it, but it only comes in one very large size so it is best to share. They also have a great salsa bar and good vegitarian tacos."}
{"text":"This place had an awesome selection and different from the Mexican food/tacos that I'm used to. I'd say a must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about this restaurant. If you come for no other reason you have to visit the salsa bar. There are no less then 20 different salsas. My favorites are the pecan (yes PECAN), cilantro, chopped chilies with garlic and the jicama. They say the first bowl of chips is complimentary, but I have never been charged for additional chips. There are so many delicious choices on this menu, and there really hadn't been an order I have regretted. I always come back to the chorizo fundido and the veggie quesa with extra cheese. I have tried about every quesa option at this point and the meat in this quesa, while optional, detracts rather then adds to the flavor. The chorizo in the appetizer more then hits my carnivore button. I would also highly recommend the tamarind margarita, with its tangy tamarind fruit muddled into the drink and the chili salt rim, you can't go wrong. On the way out you have to order a horchata to go. With its fresh strawberries and chopped walnuts it is unlike any horchata you have ever tried. You may be tempted to get one with your meal, but that would be a mistake. This drink is so complex and delicious it needs to be sipped and savored. The spices, flavors and textures of the food needs only ice water and a single shared bottle of Coca-Cola to complete the experience. They don't offer dessert, so take the horchata to go. You won't be sorry!
I would also like to add that apart from the burritos all the menu items are gluten free. You need only stipulate corn tortillas when ordering things like fundito or as a side to the soup."}
{"text":"The food was excellent but the service needs a lot of work.

The girl working up front does not know what she is doing. It was hard to watch her struggle as the two groups in front of us left after waiting for 20 minutes. The kicker is that it was not even packed. There was about 10 tables open and she made four groups wait for over 20+ minutes. She needs to be trained or let go.

The waiter was stressed out and could not remember something you said to here a few seconds ago. I ordered a Coke and horchata a total of three times. We only got the horchata as we were leaving...... The horchata was delicious though....

We ordered around 8 street tacos of different varieties and they were all A+. The selection of salsa was also very good. You can tell that they are understaffed and struggle with giving good service.

We thought we would try some tequila and the waiter brought us house tequila which tasted like cleaning materials. We then ordered the $15 Don Julio tequila and she brought back out the same house tequila..

Even though the service was terrible I would come back for the food."}
{"text":"I reserve 5 stars for meals that are  exemplary. This \"gourmet\" taco shop is truly that. Every bite is a flavor party, including the array of succulent salsas ranging from chipotle to creamy cilantro. The spicy jalapeños are truly spicy, turning me into a fire-breathing dragon for moments after I ate them.

This restaurant does justice to vegetarians, all veggies are sautéed with care and attention to spices. The mole nearly made my partner dance, dark and intricate like a Spanish tango. My Santisima quesa was a revelation, full of flavor and topped with Mexican crema, a thick corn crust that managed not to be greasy.

And the horchata? It's the real deal. We shared a margarita that tasted natural and refreshing, not a bottled mix in the house."}
{"text":"NOT FOR KIDS. Food is amazing and yummy. But they neglected to tell us they put hot chiles in the beans. We ordered bean burritos for my 5 and 6 year olds. The poor kiddos were screaming!  My little boy was in so much pain, he soiled his pants, and his lips swelled firey red. It was a bad end to a great day. 

Great food, spicy, and not for children."}
{"text":"La Santísima is not authentic Mexican food at all. Only the plate names but that's it. I liked the chips, salsa bar (because of the variety but I only tried the Mexican salsa and guacamole salsa), avocado salad side and decoration portraits but the tacos, burrito and horchata were not good. The tacos were plain, the chicken in the burrito didn't have flavor and it was served on a broken plate and the horchata didn't taste like actual horchata. Also, there was only one another party so I don't understand why the service was so slow. I definitely would not go back!"}
{"text":"The cabo fried shrimp tacos are the best thing to me. Salsa bar is awesome as well. Little over hyped. Cramped seating. Service is mediocre. One guy does a good job but he's not always there. I've had to wait for a while before. One time I just estimated my tab, left money and left. For a spot that made it on diners and dives they need some work. I would think they would care more about service and presentation. Food is always good. But I'm not there to hang out for long. Reminds me of a little dive in mexico. I usually enjoy myself despite the flaws. Best is go when its slow."}
{"text":"This place was ok...

Parking was slim, but there was space on the street. 

It's a nice, friendly place.. small, but welcoming to our large group.

The salsa bar was nice.  There were a lot of different ones to choose from and everyone was able to find ones that they enjoyed. The chips were free (there were some reviews saying they were charged for chips..)

i had the taco/burro combo.. I got the shrimp taco and the gaucho steak burro.  The shrimp had a lot of breading.  It had good flavor, but the shrimp was a little dry. I also found that the steak in my burro was a little dry.  Again, it had good flavor, but i was disappointed in the meat. The grilled squash that came with the plate was good though! 

I decided that I had to try the horchata because of all the reviews.  It was pretty good, but I didn't care for the chunks of fruit.  It was difficult to drink through the straw towards the end, and I ended up wasting 1/4 of my $4 drink... 

Pricing is higher than noted.  My plate was $12ish and the horchata was $4.  After tax and tip, it was over $20.  

All in all, it was a decent meal/experience, but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I normally do not like Mexican food in restaurants because I am used to having my friend's mom's cooking at home. This place was great, the food is fresh and made when ordered. The salsa bar is also great. Highly recommend it to people who wants Mexican food that tastes great. Thank you guys for the wonderful experience"}
{"text":"The sauce bar alone is worth the trip. Jenny C and her horrible taste buds can have her Taco Bell and their sauce. I enjoyed trying peanut, strawberry, radish, cilantro, guacamole, Cabo, chipotle, and Mexican salsa. We ordered a carne asada burrito. Good sauce in it, a healthy amount of peppers and avocado and cucumber. Fresh tortilla and ingredients. Cool dia de las muertes decor and a tight, cramped but bustling crowd. It's probably a better foodie place than a first date location. I loved it. I realize tastes differ, but anyone who thinks Taco Bell has more to offer ought to get their head and not just their tongue checked out for damage. That's you Jenny C."}
{"text":"I thought for sure I had already reviewed this place long ago... It is, hands down, the best Mexican food I've had in Arizona. We come here at least twice every time my boyfriend is in Phoenix for Spring Training. Best tacos. Best salsa variety. Best service. Can't wait till March when I get to come back!!"}
{"text":"Decided to drop into this establishment that I kept hearing amazing things about. First I ordered the Award Winning Margarita, and if I could I would give them another award. Holy cow this was delicious with the spicy salt on the side!!!! (Sighhhhhh) I was sad when I finished it...three drops of tears came out. We got some of the tacos for appetizers and let the waitress order them for us. Let me just say that the baby shark was fried to perfection. The signature taco everyone needs to try because the flavors coming off the steak were tasty and forced me to sit back and enjoy. Finally for our final dish of the day we had a Quesa which is this interesting take on a quesadilla that was more like a stuffed sopapilla with a delicious filling of steak, mushrooms, peppers, onions and some sort of magical dust that made me fall in love! This place was awesome and the only reason that it lost a star was that they seemed short staffed  and the poor waitress was running everywhere and appeared to be the only one there. Thank you for upping the downtown food game."}
{"text":"Offers more of a unique offering to the traditional mom-and-pop Mexican restaurant. Lots of tasty tacos to choose from (the tiger shrimp was the best we tried) and they do a different spin on quesadillas. These are served fried and puffy. Lots of cheesy filling inside- the Gaucho was tasty but with all of the unique flavors (chimichirri, pickled onions, etc) I thought it would be a bit more flavorful. Definitely large enough to share. 

Salsa bar has many flavorful options, but I don't like the idea of all patrons having access to something I'd consume (too many dirty hands, coughing, sneezing). 

The margarita had barely any tequila, but I did appreciate the fresh fruit slices in it.  

This is a TINY, TINY place and doesn't offer much authenticity when it comes to decor or music (Katy Perry and other pop music - cringe)."}
{"text":"I read about this place in New Times and saw two words that always speak to me like they are some alluring foreign language.... COCHINITA PIBIL! I've made this dish at home a couple of times, and it takes me a couple of days, so when I get to eat it it is a real treat. 

Went into La Condesa around 7:30 on Thursday night and went straight to the counter and ordered the glorious achiote and orange maranated pig, along with rice and beans and a homemade horchata. Chips were included. While I was waiting for food, the people running the place were over the top nice. The man told me about some tips to making cochinita pibil including using cinnamon, which I'd never done. The girl actually introduced herself, shook my hand, and asked my name. I've never had anyone do that in a restaurant. She proceeded to explain the salsa bar, which had about a dozen different salsas though they plan to have 20 in total eventually. 

The chips were fresh, all 5 of the salsas I tasted were delicoius, especially the green cream and the watermelon. My Horchata was amazing, just perfect. They topped it with crushed nuts, and there were strawberry chunks and whatnot in it. Very unique but amazing. My tacos came, and I was quick to pick off the raw onion and replace it with the proper pickled onion slices as it should have come in the first place. No problem, they have the pickled ones at the salsa bar along with all the other veggies. The tacos were full of meat bursting at the seams... large portions were great for me as I'm used to such small tacos. Their refried beans were creamy and well cooked with a nice cheese garnish, and the buttery smooth rice was delicious as well. 

For the fact that this place is nice, decorated with dia de los muertos style art, mexican wrestling posters, the niceness of people, and the excellent food, this place gets five stars as easily as any restaurant I've been to in Arizona. It reminded me of Mama Testa, which has grown to be one of the best known taco shops in San Diego. Phoenix has never seen anything like this. They asked if I want to come back, and I assured them, it will be soon. Very soon."}
{"text":"Had the 3 taco plate.  One was really good(the chorizo one), one had no flavor and was so dry i had to douse it in salsa to make it edible.  The third was fried in the tortilla, which was a bit strange but ok.

My friend had something else.  I forget what but he said it was fairly poor.

We waited a long damn time to get food.(30 min at least).  They gave us free chips, but it turned a quick dinner that i had high hopes for into a very long one that i would have rather not eaten.

I liked the salsa bar.  It was pretty impressive in its variety (16 different types i think)

Not going back without a gun to my head."}
{"text":"This is a petty good hidden gem that sits on a Main Street. Found this place on diners drives and dives. They were famous for their tacos and salsas. 

The decor is very nice. The chairs are comfy and they have a wall with bench seating which is very cool a gets a thumbs up from me. They have beautiful paintings on the walls. They have a small bar with a good selection of hard alcohol, wine and beer. They also have a outside patio which is pretty large. 

The food was pretty good. We ordered our tacos a la carte because we wanted to try different ones. The street tacos have a good amount of meat in them. Not skimpy like most places. And we also ordered one of the signature tacos and they are big. No wonder why they are $4+ a taco lol. 

Over all this place is a nice place to hang out at. I can see them having a great taco Tuesday. My reasoning for only giving them 4 stars is because I can't give half of a star. The reason for hall a star off Is because they serve can drinks instead of fountain. I hate when a restaurant gives you can sodas."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Awesome salsa bar! I especially enjoyed the tiger shrimp tacos! Friendly staff, this place is a little bigger than the 16th street location."}
{"text":"The food is good from prior experience.  I love the concept but the service was lacking here.  My friend and our kids were waiting at a table for a bigger one to open up and nobody came to clean the table.  To me that is just rude to offer it to us to wait at and not clean it.  The place is just too small and they should change their policy of not letting you order anything until seated."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican place! Great fresh guacamole, tacos, burritos! Really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in Phoenix that I have ever had! They have an amazing salsa bar with flavors I never could have thought to be salsas. I have the mahi burro and it was awesome. Everything made from scratch down to the tortillas. It's in a kind of \"rough\" location, but don't let that stop you from this place!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  So many unique and delicious salsas to choose from and the entrees  were superb! Very unique Mexican food spot that I'd definitely recommend. Friendly staff a real plus, too."}
{"text":"Tacos the way they should be. I cannot rave enough about this place. Considering myself a foodie that likes to try NEW places all the time, I found myself coming back to this gem on vacation. The mahi mahi and shrimp taco special combo were so unbelievably good, I would rank them above the Grand Canyon. Was I just that hungry?...um no. 

Salsa bar is great and there are bottomless chips, margarita was tasty. Service is average, but if you come here for service you have it all wrong!"}
{"text":"When we first walked in it was a really welcoming vibe, the waitress was really friendly and the service was fast. The drinks were amazing! I can't express how good the drinks were. The tacos were not bad but felt that they were over powered by the vegetation, but once all that was clear it was game on. The best taco was the chorizo and potatoes, there was a lot of flavor and soaked all of the taste buds. Will definitely come back for more. Keep cookin la santisma!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a hidden gem of Phoenix, La Santisima is definitely one of those places!!

The decor and vibe of the place is top notch. Even though it is a bit small, it has a bit feel on the inside. The decor is not over the top and for being a taco shop, has the ability to seem a bit classy.

The biggest thing that would sell anyone on this place is the salsa bar. Every type of salsa you can think of. Some ranging from really hot to super mild. Some specialty salsa as well made form guacamole, cashews, and fruit. You can definitely chow down a few baskets of tortilla chips trying all the different types of salsa.

I ordered the Azteca Tinga Burrito. It came out really quick and was huge. The burrito itself had an amazing flavor on its own, but I added some of their salsas to spice it up a bit and it made it even more amazing. The chicken was cooked very well and was very flavorful. Even the beans and veggies in the burrito had their own flavor to it.

I am looking forward to visiting this place more and more and trying as many different items on their menu as possible. Not to mention all the salsas!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is schizophrenic.  The front of the house is a nightmare: incredibly slow, somewhat aloof service, small plastic cups of water that don't get refilled, restroom issues (the men's was closed and the women's was dirty which is unacceptable at all public establishments but especially in a restaurant).  When we sat down there were chips on the table but no napkins; those didn't arrive until dinner so I went into the restroom and grabbed some paper towels.  Speaking of salsa, the restaurant has a salsa bar with at least a dozen different types to choose from -- great idea in theory, but unfortunately about half of the containers were empty and they were not refilled the entire time we were there.  

However...I gave this place 3 stars because the food is indeed delicious.  My husband and I ended up ordering the same thing -- a \"street taco\" plate with 3 different tacos, rice, and beans.  The al pastor, chicken mole, and pork pibil tacos are fabulous, with complex flavors that explode in your mouth. The food is high quality, fresh, and incredibly tasty. I would have liked to tell you about the guacamole, but at 8:00 p.m. they were out of it.

We noticed that they offer take out service and I would recommend that as the sole way to get food from La Santisima.  In addition to the lousy, indifferent service the restaurant is tiny, crowded, and doesn't have much atmosphere.  They really should expand to a larger space where they can better meet the demand that's been generated from all the favorable press and their admittedly delicious Mexican fare."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Great service. The restaurant was nice and good music. We definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, only bad thing is that they only have one or two people hosting and serving at one time so it takes a while. But food is Amazing and staff is friendly they just need more help."}
{"text":"I found this jewel recently. From the Dia de los muertes theme to the salsa bar. To the people to the amazing food. You can't beat this place. One of the best experiences I have had. Go! You'll thank me"}
{"text":"So many salsas at the salsa bar, which is like candy land for someone like me! I had the Carne Asada  taco and Aztec Tinga burrito and my lady had the street tacos ,the food was different , don't know if I'll  ever come back to this places . It's want them were you scratch off your bucket list..  You'll understand what I'm talking about !!!"}
{"text":"Item's tasted include.

Free Chips and Salsa Bar - options including Chipotle, Pico de Gailo, Robano Pibil, Peanut, Jicama, Pecan, Soy, etc.

Baja Sur Shark Taco - Corn Tortilla with Beer Battered Wild Dogfish and lettuce with cilantro mayo

Cabo Shrimp Taco with Beer Battered Wild Tiger Shrimp and cilantro mayo, jicama

Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco - Roasted Pork Shoulder with Achiote Rojo slow cooked in banana leaves topped with lime marinated onions and salsa habanera mayo

Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Taco - Spices, Chiles, Nuts, and Chocolate

Realizing that an inordinate portion of our travel west, from the Port Fonda experience at Greendirt Farm outside of Kansas City to The Shed and Salsa Brava, had focused on Mexican food I couldn't help but pass by La Condessa while my mother was in town for tacos and although I know some in Phoenix may claim the space is not \"authentic\" enough for them (from what I've gathered, according to some locals you need to have questionable evaluations from the Health Department to be legit) I can say without a doubt that although I've not been south of the border, these are the best tacos I've ever tasted.

Beginning first with another free chips-and-salsa-bar stocked with a baker's dozen of house-made salsas and sauces paired with slightly salted, almost greaseless, and pleasantly warm tortilla chips and moving on to the four tacos featuring local produce and fresh proteins on (unfortunately not house made) imported flour tortillas I particularly enjoyed the crunchy texture and delicate flavors of the shrimp taco while the bright acidity of the pork shoulder and smoky spice of the chicken taco both worked nicely as well.  

Perhaps not as regional as some taco stands (or trucks) and instead choosing to focus on the depth and breadth of Mexican cuisine from coast to coast I'm sure the is \"better\" or \"more authentic\" cuisine to be found both here and over the border, but thus far I've not experienced it (outside of the vastly more upscale, expensive, and certainly less authentic Distrito.)"}
{"text":"Walked in tonite which restaurant was busy due to Glendale Glitters. Since I was by myself I sat at bar. After at least 10 minutes, I left due to no one greeting me or asking me if I wanted a drink despite multiple servers coming in & out my of bar area. Maybe no one is served at bar & only for show. Even as I walked out one server just looked at me & smiled which she saw me sitting at bar. I suggest your restaurant work on greeting people & making them feel welcome instead of ignoring them. You lost a customer tonite."}
{"text":"For our Sunday lunch we were in the mood for some truly authentic tacos and thought we'd give this place a try.

Location & Aesthetics - located on N 16th Street in Phoenix which I noticed can be a little busy with traffic even though it was Sunday.
Parking is a little poor (-1) with a few stalls located outside the restaurant, and some of these parking spots are shared with another business on the corner.  
I did notice some other available parking in the vicinity but believed they were for other businesses.
Unfortunately N 16th Street was busy, at the time of our visit, so you can't really stop alongside the parking spots to wait for someone to leave as that might cause some traffic on the busy street.  Thankfully there's a side street on the right that you can turn into to turn around.
The facade of the restaurant cannot be missed with its brightly green colored painting and large saint figure adorning the front of the restaurant.  
Another drawback the restaurant had going for it, in my opinion, is the small interior size (-1).  
As soon as you open the door, you will immediately notice how small it is as you will see diners siting at their tables right at the door as you enter.  I can see this could be a little bothersome if you've been seated close to the front door, and with it opening and closing, doesn't bode well for a nice dining experience for some.
There is a bench outside of the restaurant for you to wait for seating if the inside is full, and with no real shade and I didn't see any misters, that can be uncomfortable, I guess, during the summer months.

Menus - provided to us as soon as we were shown where to sit and were pretty self-explanatory.   

Service - We were warmly greeted by staff upon entering.  It might've been nice if we were asked if we've been here before but no problem as any questions we had, was answered promptly.

Food - Once seated, you are provided with a bowl of tortilla chips, and there's an available salsa bar with a large variety of salsa dips to choose from.  The dips all sit on ice being chilled and have varying degrees of hotness.  From the 5-6 dips that I chose from, they all tasted freshly made and was enough to open the appetite.
Prior to ordering, I was in the mood for some libations and ordered myself a mojito which in my opinion was perfectly concocted as you could taste the lime juice (tasted fresh), rum, right amount of sugar, and contained enough leaves of mint.
For food, I ordered the -- Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco, Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, and the Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Shark Taco with a side of rice and beans.  
All three tacos tasted absolutely great and delicious.  There were all flavorful, seasoned well, fresh, not too spicy, and cooked just right.

Definitely a place I wouldn't mind returning to."}
{"text":"Salsa Bar is still on point. I feel like with the expansion its not as cozy and the music did not match the restaurant any more. Food was still great and the Horchata is still MVP. Service was still great, I just personally enjoyed the place when it was smaller. The air conditioning was a bit to cold even though it was 115 out! All in all not a bad place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"My mom and I were referred to go to this place for some tacos and so when she was visiting me in Phoenix, we finally went to check it out! We pulled up and were very skeptical by the look of the outside, but we were greeted right away to pick a table. We both got the Cabo Shrimp Taco and a steak taco and it had this amazing fried cheese in it. And the salsa bar was amazing. I think the Cilantro salsa was my favorite. The beans and rice were also to die for. The shrimp in my taco were so delicious. I couldn't get over how amazing this place was. We happened to go for happy hour and got $5 Grapefruit margaritas as well. BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER. I wish there was one in California. 

P.S- Everyone around us ordered a quesadilla because they are stuffed inside their homemade tortillas and deep fried. Can't wait to go back and try these. 

The service was awesome, too!"}
{"text":"This small restaurant is amazing! The food is wonderful would highly recommend this place. Its not super fancy but the food all but makes up for it. The El Gatcho is the way to go!~"}
{"text":"Great place. Easy to miss though, so look closely. Small place and not much parking! Once we actually found it (we drove right past it the first time) we were greeted warmly. The menu is extensive and there are a ton of great options for vegetarians. First time I've ever had grilled cactus (and it was great!). The server was friendly, the food was fresh, and everything came out really quickly. They also have a salsa bar so you can try a bunch of different salsas on your food. The decor was also pretty awesome- lots of Day of the Dead decor. The overwhelmingly positive reviews are justified."}
{"text":"Vine  aquí con mi familia después de ir al zoo   La comida excelente el servicio maravilloso especialmente nuestro mesero  Joe.  Esta es nuestra segunda ve y se que volveremos"}
{"text":"Thanks fellow yelpers. 
Heading home to Seattle from an awesome spring break with family needing some good Mexican before hitting the airport. 
This place delivered. Exactly what we were hoping for. Street Tacos were awesome, salsa bar a hit with everyone in the family and the guacamole with cranberries were legit. 
Thanks for keeping it real."}
{"text":"The Gandhi burrito was amazing!!! I substituted the rice for cheese and it tasted delicious!!! Everyone raved about the salsa bar, but the salsas seemed old and noone was refilling them, it was a great concept but wish it was more fresh! The horschatta was also good, a but pricy but it has fruits and pecans which we never had before! My husband got the tacos which were good but not the best hes ever had. I would def go to get the burrito"}
{"text":"Definitely the best mexican place in the west valley! Very authentic and unique flavors! Escape all the chains and go to this place! You can't go wrong with the margarita that has grapefruit in it!"}
{"text":"Diverse menu and great salsa bar.  Fabulous service and will return.  Came in for breakfast, but ended up downing 3 tacos."}
{"text":"I was craving tacos and so glad I came here. Food is very well priced and service was so friendly. They were very patient with my mom who can be slow to order and very picky so I really appreciated their taking the time to explain the menu and make recommendations. The salsa bar is unbelievable, like 12 different kinds to try. I got street tacos and they were very filling and tasty. The space is small and it's in an area that could use some love but I say have the proper expectations and you won't be disappointed. Finally, the art will catch your eye from the old timey wooden doors to the luchador decor in the bathrooms to the day of the dead altar. My favorite was the painting over the salsa bar."}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Amazing recipes for tacos and quesadillas, like the chimichurri style Gaucho. They have incredible breakfasts, too. Incredible chilaquiles! And their salsa bar is world class. Finally, the servers are pros: so efficient and friendly. We don't go anywhere else in downtown."}
{"text":"Incredible tacos and quesadillas and salsa bar like the original, plus the space is large and beautiful! Service is a little slower, though."}
{"text":"Yummy deliciouuuuus mole!

A bit too pricey for Tacos/Mexican food.

Place is VERY small.

Salsa selection is very interesting, lots of different ones, some that I had NEVER seen in my life, and I am Mexican.

I will definitely try their quesadillas if I decide to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Great food all around. I usually get the Fundido, Argentine quesa, or any of the tacos. After that load up on the crazy salsa choices."}
{"text":"The place is very compact. Way too small for my taste so it's not very comfortable to dine in. The salsa bar has good salsas but presentation make sit unappealing. Service took really long but all in all the food was ok. The horchata was really good!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place, the two stars were  only given because the restaurant and bathroom was clean and the only saving grace I would recommend is the \"cochinita pibil\" taco. Let me begin by saying we came in sat down restaurant was empty waitresses were talking amongst themselves for a good 8 minutes before we were greeted. Cool not a big problem they are only human. The menu had a terrible background which made it hard to see the selections and I kind of wished our waitress interacted with us and suggested some good eats. It was like a hi here's the menu Be back in 10 kind of service. I ordered the Hochata because of the good reviews husband ordered a sprite. The hochata had walnuts with strawberries, but the strawberries tasted very acidy which threw off the drink and the hochata was very watered down. The complimentary chips were cold,stale and burnt.  It was nice they had a salsa bar but they weren't anything special the cups were so tiny you had to go multiple times(not a deal breaker as I can see it as cost effective for them I suppose.) The restaurant was cute but very tiny. My husband's order was \"meh\" from what he said  he ate only  half. I ordered the three taco plate because I wanted to try the selection here's where it gets interesting: the \"cochinita pibil\" was pretty good if there's one stand out thing I can say in that menu it's that! Tasted as good as authentic. It was the only solace for me. The other taco I ordered was the \"Al' pastor\" guys this taco was so bland and dry and fatty not in a good way but when you bit into it it was literally chewy pieces of pork fat there was more fat then meat. The worst taco after this was the Mahi A'l pastor\" it smelled really bad. I've had mahi before and it wasn't the regular smell it should smell like however I thought well I'm pregnant so I thought maybe it's just my hormones and smell sense. Well I decided to give it to my husband because it was giving me nausea and I thought nothing of it til we left and I asked him what he thought of it. Now mind you my husband is not picky and loves fish loves the outdoors eating deer wild things etc. but he said \"I took one bite and almost threw up\" it tasted like the smell of cow manure I couldn't swallow the first bite.\" So we both guessed late that it was spoiled. He didn't want to make a fuss and I thought it was just me. But nope we were right. The only thing that crosses my mind is as a cook as a server why would you think it would be alright to serve this to someone if it smelled awful? We paid 40 dollars for three tacos,beans rice and one burrito and two non alcoholic drinks. Which was pricy for the quality to be so disappointing. That was enough for me to say on to you guys that be very cautious in going here. I do not recommend it and we will not come here again unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is taco heaven. 

Starting with the salsa bar that has several different types of salsas. From your classic pico, to pecan, strawberry, and the popular cilantro-cream, plus many more. Emphasis on the pecan because sweet jesus that stuff is so good. 

Refreshing Jamaica? Check. Sweet, milky horchata with nuts & fruit? Check. 

Lots of variety. The Mahi Mahi tacos, the Sonoran carne, the Dogfish, the Cabo shrimp - all of them are incredibly delicious. They do seafood very well here; never over or undercooked, and usually served up with fresh cabbage and drizzled with mayo, mole, or what have you. The rice is also excellent - always tender and perfectly seasoned. The Bullet burro (beans & cheese) is also pretty good, especially when you smother it in their fresh cilantro salsa. 

I've noticed some people saying they wish it was located in downtown-downtown Phoenix (what they really mean is gentrified), but I disagree. I like the location, especially because it's nestled in on the same street with other less \"hip\" mom & pop shops. It has a great neighborhood vibe - very comfortable. 
 
Put simply, I love this place. If you haven't tried it, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place - the food was great, the salsa bar awesome, and the service really bad.  I really like the filling choices,  especially in a taco.  Their quesadillas are like a thick fry bread, I though they we're too greasy but everyone else raved.

Leave extra time to check out, it took longer than the meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Great service!!! Loved it!!! I will go back for sure! The guacamole salsa was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! The best horchata and the salsa bar was great. The tacos were to die for and I loved the mole taco."}
{"text":"Went to La Santisima for lunch on Cinco de Mayo with some colleagues. The restaurant is on the smaller side, and you order your food and pay at the register, and then find a table. 
The restaurant has a salsa bar with a lot of good options. I had the guacamole and pico, both were excellent. Would have been nice if they replaced the chips on our table - having four of us the first basket didn't last long.
I had chicken tacos for my meal, which were also good. The tacos were a lighter Mexican meal, which wasn't a bad thing for lunch time. Rice and beans both good. 
Prices were reasonable. Overall would recommend."}
{"text":"Best part was the chips & different salsas (tried 3 & they were all fresh & delicious). The tacos were another story. Had the carne asada: dry, chewy, and flavorless. This isn't a taco truck, I expect better."}
{"text":"Food is very good. I had the al pastor quesadilla which is unbelievable. The service was slow and waiter a bit grumpy but the food is worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Taco are good but the service is always very disappointing. Very slow...... My husband order a margarita and even though it was very delicious it took 15 to arrive vat the table."}
{"text":"My coworker and I stopped here for lunch today. The selections on the menu are plentiful and overwhelming. I was impressed with the variety of vegetarian options. I had the gaucho burrito, and my coworker had the Azteca Tinga burrito. The food was amazing! Make sure you get the horchata. It was the best I've ever had. There were strawberries, apples, and nuts in the drink. You will be mad at yourself later if you don't order it. The salsa bar is also ridiculously good, but your burrito will need no condiments."}
{"text":"This place is completely unique and the food is very good. They have this thing they call a quesa, which is raw corn tortilla dough that they roll out and stuff with the meat of your choice (we tried the Sonora Arrachera Quesa), close it up and deep fry it. OMG, what a flavor explosion! We also had the Carne Asada and Aztec Tinga tacos. Both were delicious, but fair warning, the Tinga is a tad messy to eat, so don't wear white. Their list of taco and burrito options is lengthy, (including meatless) and there has to be something for everyone. I was a little dissapointed in their salsa bar. It has tons of tasty choices, but really, most of them are what I think of as sauces (no texture) and not salsas. Great for the tacos, not so much for the chips. Besides the chips, there is nothing with any crunch (i.e. flauta, crispy taco, chimichanga) on the menu, which is odd since they do fry the Quesas (they have a light crispiness, but the thickness of the dough prevents them from being crunchy). For those two reasons, I am giving four stars rather than five, but don't let that fool you. The food is top notch!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  Everything I have gotten is delicious.  I am a vegetarian and there are multiple options for me when I go.  They have a salsa bar so you can try different things at once."}
{"text":"Tried the tacos and their unique quesadillas. Two thumbs up - though my waistline might not appreciate too many of those fried quesadillas, lol. They'll have to be a treat - not a regular thing for me.

Their salsa bar is a lot of fun. Be prepared to spend some time sampling all of them.

Gotta love the dia de los muertos decorating. Unique!"}
{"text":"BEST HORCHATA EVER!  I've never liked horchata, but I was told this was the best of the best and I absolutely had to try it.  So, I did and I am SO glad that I did.  I would go back for the horchata alone.  Amazing.  I'm already planning a trip back just for the horchata!

I get the 3 street taco combo with rice and beans.  I've had the carne asada, al pastor and cochinita.  The carne asada was delicious and the cochinita was good, but my absolute favorite was the al pastor.  It's the best al pastor taco I've ever had!

The salsa bar is awesome.  My favorite is the tomatillo and my friend loved the chipotle.  It has something for everything and it's all fresh.

All in all - a great little place (emphasis on little - probably not great for a large ground of people).  The food is authentic and very, very good - I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Worth any wait,  ours was minimal.  Horchata and salsa bar were great highlights! 

Loved the decor and character of the place.  Dia del morte all about including cool mosaic tile art. We walked right up past the bar to look up menus and wait on a table.  No tables available.  I was directed to use the men's room.  Which was decorated yet cluttered with a music stand,  stool,  and supplies.  I couldn't open the slider lock easily and had feared they'd have to break the door down but I got lucky and got out.   By the time I got out,  only a few minutes,  my friend was seated.  Tunes were good,  Even when I couldn't understand the music I was grooving. 

Menu was a bit overwhelming with so many choices.  Got the best horchata ever with strawberries, cantaloupe, and pecans.  It was mammoth. 

Settled in on a fish taco and Mahi Mahi,  both grilled.  They were hot to handle,  and a bit over filled.  Nice because good value,  but the bottom tortillas were soggy. 

Only got two bites of this delishness in,  because I filled up on chips and fun salsas from the salsa bar.  The horchata contributed too. 

The peanut salsa was the hottest,  and the salsa de albor was my first experience with this fruity hot Mexican Chile.  The jicama was nice and refreshing and cooling but very hard to get on the chip as by its nature wasn't saucy.  However the cilantro was too soupy so I could only pour it on.  The pecan wasn't spicy like the peanut and was therefore nice against the heat as well."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in here after a day of shopping and it was nearby.  The reviews on  yelp made us stop by.

The three stars are really based on the quality of the food and the location of the restaurant to me.  

The food quality was good, but didn't knock my socks off.  I can get just as good tacos elsewhere in the valley.
- Two taco plate ($9) - had two different kind of tacos, with two tortillas per taco type, rice and beans.  I had the smoked marlin, which I tasted more of the salsa than the marlin...  and the Sonoran carne asada tacos which were yummy but I've had better elsewhere.
- I also wanted to try the el pastor street tacos ($3 for two tortillas).  They were yummy but sadly I had Rocky Point on the top of my mind and I remember getting better there.... 
-My friend got a chicken deep friend quesas that had peppers and onions in it.  It was very yummy and a large portion but very rich.

The restaurant was cute, but small.  Luckily it was just the two of us because a large group would be too much.
The menu was extensive, it was hard to make a decision.
There were tons of salsas to try and a free basket of chips when we sat down, so it was fun to try all the different salsas.

The wait staff was friendly and attentive, I really did like my lunch there but I wouldn't call myself a \"fan\".  It was good though, and if I happen to be in the area (which is very rare) I would stop in."}
{"text":"Smells like mop bucket from cleaning floors. Ordered pastor burrito enchilada style. No cheese inside or out. Was still pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Food here is delicious and the drinks as well.
My issue is when you call to try and place a pick up order; they ask you to hold but take forever or don't come back to the phone. I've been on hold for over 22 minutes to place an order for co-workers and myself. I would rate it higher if the phone orders weren't such an issue"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great service. This place is a must go to. The food is very authentic and presented well. Will come again."}
{"text":"The first time i came here i remember sharing the hell out of it on social media and kind of convincing myself that the $5 tacos were amazing.  After visiting a few more times i realized the cool factor and individuality here just doesn't really match up to the much more traditional tacos you find at other spots.  The tacos are not bad, but overthought, and the flavors in many of the \"gourmet\" tacos just don't really do it for me.  Too much going on at once.  Another thing that causes my 3 star review is the salsa bar.  At first glance it looks very promising with lots of options and colors.  Once again the taste of the numerous salsas is lacking something.  Its like 10 salsas that are just OK when you could have knocked a simple red and green sauce out of the park instead.  They're drinks are good and i really like the vibe inside, but i don't think it lives up to the hype that the many reviews will lead you to believe."}
{"text":"Service was super slow we waited 70 minutes from when we ordered to get our food. Food was cold the only good thing was the chips and salas waitress blamed it on having only one cook because the other two cooks left early. Will never go back there hopefully the one off 16th street is better. Oh and my Wife had to leave the bathroom door cracked open with a chair because the light was burnt out"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed by our meal! :( I really wanted to give this place a chance..

PROS
The salsa bar is very extensive and you can tell that it is all homemade! Great selection and favorites were the salsa verde
Cheap beer - Modelos were $3
My favorite taco was the Al Pastor, added pico and extra lime

CONS
Very small place, we got there early to avoid the wait
Seating by the window can be VERY warm especially during these summer months
Music was static and scratchy it was annoying while eating
The chicken mole taco was such a disappointment - the flavors were not right
The rice was non traditional was just plain with no cilantro or salsa/seasonings

Did we eat most of our taco platters? Yes.
Did we think service was a little spotty and can be improved? Yes.
Do we think that our divey place in Downtown Chandler is levels above this \"modern/more pricy\" version that is out of the way location wise) for us? Yes."}
{"text":"After sampling five tacos, I'll jump on the La Santisima train. A lot of other people have already been riding it with the four and a half star rating in 1.3 K reviews. The street tacos, the service, and the salsa bar were the standouts for us.

We had no wait when we entered on a Friday at 1:30 and were seated at the two top right by the bar. We were served by I believe one of the owners or managers and he took great care of us also answering questions and offering suggestions. The tacos are divided into a \"gourmet\" and \"street\" section, priced at $3.99/$2.25 respectively. If you don't want your protein in a taco, they also serve burros, quesadillas, and lonches. If I had my dirty menu police badge on, I would have cited them for one count as there was a couple splotches of salsa verde on my menu.

We upgraded to two combos for a buck and change so we could have some beans and rice. And of course we sampled plenty of salsas while eating our chips. I enjoyed all three of the street tacos we ordered. The shark taco was overcooked and the corners were tough. The black mole was different with a deeper flavor with bitter notes and very mild sweetness. For two combo plates with 5 tacos, $20 was an affordable price. I'll definitely see what else they have to offer on the next train stop."}
{"text":"I can come back to this place anytime! I always recommend this Mexican Gourmet restaurant to all my friends when they are up to trying something new. 
I love ordering the street tacos with rice and beans. The Cochinito Pibil meat is very delicious. The horchata is mouth watering! The horchata is served with pineapples, strawberries, and peanuts at the top of the drink. 
It's a great place for a date, lunch, or after work happy hour. I wouldn't recommend big parties."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place as had been recommended to me by several people.  The white fish tacos are amazing, the salsa was fresh and yummy! Sadly only one girl was serving the entire restaurant, she did the best she could.  Oddly our table was falling apart, literally the pieces of siding was broke and hanging on, was just hoping it would not pinch our arms. I was ok with the broken furniture; but was very disappointed in the temperature was the adult beverages.  Initially ordered a glass of the house white wine and it was served warm, decided to grab a beer in hopes the beverage temp would be different sadly it was not. The beer was a hair colder then the warm wine, beverage refrigerator may need to be checked. Will try again if see coupon."}
{"text":"Oh the HORROR!! 

I can here on a lunch date with my husband and two year old. We had an hour since it was on my husbands lunch break, and decided on this place because I was craving some \"street tacos\", and the reviews/pictures looked awesome.... oh how I was wrong!!

Seems easier to number all the issues we had!

1. We walk in at 12:10 to a nearly empty restaurant, I first try to use the bathroom, and the light wasn't working... that should have been my first clue. 
2. We sit down and a few minutes later the place is packed, but for some reason everyone has been help except us!?! 
3. Finally someone comes to help, I ordered the horchata since it was mentioned so frequently in the reviews, my husband ordered a Sierra Mist (remember it came in a to-go cup with a lid)  The horchata was bizarra, and $4
4. My 2 year old daughter grabs the free chips.. and I see MOLD on it, then realize the whole basket is full of moldy chips!! No wonder they are free!
5. A different waiter finally shows up since the other waitress was busy taking care of the customers that came AFTER us... I ordered the Sonora Arrachera Taco, and told them about the MOLDY chips, he apologized and took the chips away.  The original waitress came back, apologized for the chips, and said she would comp the drinks, I returned the horchata, and got a Sierra Mist as well (also came in a to-go cup, there's a reason I am mentioning this)
6. After 20 min and being there for 40 and food had not arrived I asked for it to-go. about 5 min later it came along with the bill that only included the food.

By this point I was annoyed but probably wouldn't have given it 1 star, so we leave with to-go cups in hand along with food. I dropped my husband off at work, then drove home. When I got home I ate 1 taco which was pretty good, the meat was flavorful and tender, I only wished I had some of that salsa to add to it. Then I got a text from my husband.....

7. My husband asks \"is your Sierra Mist BROWN??? I  open the lid and sure enough it looks like dirty water!!!

Seconds later the entire meal... is in the trash! VOMIT!   I gave this place more chances then I ever give a place. WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"We were taken aback by the decor, waitstaff, the patrons, and classic rock playing, because it appeared filled with hipsters,  an all male staff, and an interior with a very confused identity.   HOWEVER, I will be returning, and I will tell you why.....
       1. Salsa bar, simply delicious.  All of them. From mild, to smoky, to hot, there's a peanut and pecan salsa, jicama, guacamole, Pico de gallo, and several more. 
       2. Great menu choices, not your typical American/Mexican options.  
       3. The street tacos! !! We chose Al Pastor,  Carne Asada, y Cochinita Pibil with rice and beans. Uhhhhh-mazing!  

From a white girl who used to never eat Mexican, who is now married to a Mexican.....
I was totally impressed. My husband said 4 stars, because he's got a picky palette. 
Thoroughly enjoyed my meal! Can't wait to return for a Horchata, and to try the Mole!"}
{"text":"I think most people have a \"go to\" restaurant & for us it's this amazing place for Mexican food.  We've been around the Phoenix area for many years.  It's wonderful to see a new business succeed right from the start.  That's this place !  Wonderful menu!  Excellent service!  Nice atmosphere!  If you're in the east valley or really anywhere in the valley, give it a try!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Seattle and were excited for some great Mexican food and based on the reviews La Santisima seem to be the spot. Our visit started with us waiting for about 5 minutes to be seated in a restaurant with only three tables being served. The service continued to be slow and not very interested in our experience. We started with two margaritas and when I finished mine I wasn't offered another. Once the food arrived it was very authentic but wasn't fabulous."}
{"text":"Met up with Aileen mid week.  A really cute place! I loved the artwork. I had this place bookmarked for the  longest time. 

I ordered the fish tacos and they were a-ok nothing stood out for me. We both ordered house margaritas and mine was a little too strong but tasty to Aileen.   If I am ever in the area I might try different menu items."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Had the dark mole shrimp tacos. Delicious, with a great salsa bar. I like the atmosphere of a small place with good tacos."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE this place.

I have found my new place that I will go to for tacos over all else now. 

So my mind was way bigger than my tummy but here is what I ordered:

1. Aztec Tinga Taco- Spicy yummy and honestly one of my favorite Mexican dishes so this was one of my top fav's

2. Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco- This is how I found this place and it was a good taco but didn't stand with my other tacos in taste.

3. Arrachera steak Taco-  This was the first I ate and it was awesome the steak was nice and charred and the flavor was just killer.

4. Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Taco-  Woooooow this one was awesome packed full of flavor and was very moist.  This was another one of my fav's.

5. Gaucho Taco-  This was my total favorite.  It was a carne asada steak taco with avocado and Argentinian Chimicurri sauce on it.  Oh man sooooo yummy I am drooling just thinking about it right now.  

Last I had the Horchata which had a interesting twist with fresh fruit and pecans in it.  Honestly it was one of the best Horchata's I've ever had.  

On top of all this they have an AMAZING salsa bar with about 15 different salsas for all palates.  

If you've never gone take my advice and go and thank me later.  I can't wait to go back probably won't make it past tomorrow.  :)"}
{"text":"Finally La Condessas sister spot is open. If you love La Condessa and are on the Westside then make sure to come in. The Horchata is the best I've ever had. My favorite tacos are the chicken mole, tinga, cochinita pibil, and el gaucho. They have a huge salsa bar with tons of options."}
{"text":"I was craving nopales so I searched for nopales. Not only did La Santisima have them they cooked them to perfection. I can't recall the name of the taco I had but they're in the veggie section. The salsas are tasty, the service is friendly and the tacos are bomb. You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on Dinners, Drive-ins and Dives tv show...went down the next day and had lunch with my son and future daughter in law...OMG! This is what I have been waiting for since we move to Arizona 11 years ago...Let me describe the food...no wait...I can't except to say that layers of complex and subtle flavors is unique in every dish. I had tacos...These are the real deal tacos and they do not skimp on the meat!
My son is a fine dining head chef and has taught me how to taste and eat really good food. This place is all of that and more...We ordered the Al Pastor Quesa to share...my sone that is without doubt the finest and most complete Quesa he has ever had in his mouth...It was to die for. 
I had the El Gaucho Taco...trust me...order this! it was huge and complex...I was tasting new flavors every bite...I also got the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco...pulled pork with a hint of some spice that drove us all crazy tying to identify it...I will be back for both for sure. I waited a long time to find this place...you simply must try it...you will never go back to your heavy, greasy stand-by.
I wish they had 10 starts to award. this place rocks in a way your mouth will now best!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this small boutique Mexican restaurant with emphasis on healthy and unique dishes.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"We just got off the plane from Kansas City and needed to eat quickly. We looked on Yelp and found this amazing place. We loved the salsa bar and the three different tacos we had. All we can say is \"WOW\"!!
We now wish they would come to KC."}
{"text":"A coworker introduced me to this place.I went to their Glendale location. There are a lot of different types of tacos with very different types of fish and meats you just don't find anywhere else. The salsa bar has a wide variety of salsa's with varying amounts of heat. My only con and I took away a star for it was service. It was sooo slow. Even to pay the bill I eventually had to get up and find someone to get the bill. Overall I really like this place and would recommend it."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here for a long, long time! My friend Cynthia went here a few months ago, and told me it was legit! (I trust her opinion...she was born/raised in San Diego, and she knows what's up when it comes to Mexican food!)  We finally made it down here the other day for dinner.  We parked in the back lot, and walked inside.  We were greeted immediately and shown to a table.  We were served a basket of chips, browsed the menu for a bit and then placed our order.  I went with a plethora of tacos which included a fish taco, a mole taco, a cochinita pibil taco, an al pastor taco and a carne asada taco.  Here is how they were.............

Fish Taco-  They make these with dogfish.  It was a hefty sized taco and it was mighty delicious.  It had 2 pieces of perfectly fried fish inside.  I had never had dogfish until today.  It was a very meaty and chewy fish.  Most fish tacos are white fish that break apart easily.  This fish was almost like a steak!  I would definitely get this one again.

Mole Taco-  Shredded chicken with a rich mole sauce service on top of a double corn tortilla.  It was good, but not my favorite of my selections.  Not sure if I would get this one again.  A tad messy, too.

Cochinita Pibil Taco-  This was roasted pork shoulder topped with pickled red onions.  The pork was nice and moist, and the onions gave it a nice bite.  I would get it again.

Al Pastor Taco-  This taco came topped with a a decent amount of pork, some hot red sauce, some cool avocado sauce and also some pineapple.  It was definitely tasty.  Maybe not on par with my Tacos El Gordo in SD, but still a good al pastor taco.  I would get this one again.

Carne Asada Taco-  This was my favorite of the day!  This taco came prepared simple with just steak and some cabbage (It's an AZ thing..the cabbage).  This steak was so well marinated, and so tender, it was a pleasure to eat.  I wish I would have ordered maybe 3 or 4 of these things.  It was by far the best carne asada I have had in AZ, and could hold its own vs any asada back in SD.  It was incredibly legit!  I may come back and get this in a burrito from here.  Winner, winner, carne asada dinner! 

Besides the great tacos, this place has a super awesome salsa bar!  They had at least 10 different, home made salsas on display.  I tried about 5 of them and each one was unique and tasty.  They have great chips, too!  Thin and crispy!  They went well with all the great salsas.  We got 2 baskets full.

Service was on point and all the young ladies working in the place were on top of everything!  I'm glad I went here and will definitely be coming back...soon!  Best Mexican food I have had in AZ so far!"}
{"text":"Good tacos that are large in portions and progressive on taste (not your typical sauces)  with an even better salsa bar.    Reminds me of a high end mexican place with the prices to match.   As a result, I would highly recommend you to visit this place for the food."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant because of the other great reviews that others had written. The restaurant is fairly small, but definitely authentically Mexican. 

When my party and I first sat down, we were given a bowl of fresh tortilla chips, and were encouraged to try a variety of salsas at the salsa bar. The salsas were interesting to taste, and helped make this restaurant unique from others that I have tried.

I ordered the tamarind soda, which was nothing special, and honestly just tasted like normal soda. Although the restaurant is well-known for their tacos, I decided to order the Al Pastor burro (burrito) which contained pork, guacamole, pineapple salsa and lettuce. The burrito tasted flavorful, fresh and delicious. I would definitely come back for another round."}
{"text":"The salsa bar is the reason to go.
They also have a full bar with a bunch of tequila options as well.
The restaurant is kind of dark and small but I'm kind of into that so I liked it. They are vegetarian as well as vegan friendly, limited options but still always appreciated."}
{"text":"I tried this joint simply because of the great reviews on yelp. I was not disappointed. There is an awesome salsa bar. The service was great. The staff was helpful and friendly. The food alone was worth the trip, but there was just so many wonderful elements. I had a steak and bean burro. The steak was seasoned perfectly and had a nice crust of season on it. The horchata is seriously the best I've ever had. I can't wait to take everyone I know to this great spot. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing salsa bar, I have still yet to try all the salsas but I'm working on it. The food is good, environment is cozy. Not some sort of franchised restaurant which is a plus (2 locations tho), overall good place though."}
{"text":"The Countess, she is beautiful, she is talented, she is delightful and she is bountiful, she is saucy (in the \"salsa\" sense of the word, not the \"descarado\" sense of the word:)...she's also cheap:)

But then again, so am I:)

It's Taco Tuesday (as I write this...who knows when I'll finish it and post it...maybe next Taco Tuesday...maybe not:)

But today, I needed to retox after my run along the mighty Scottsdale River (or the Crosscut Canal as the flatlanders refer to it:)

I was going to wander over to Cien Agave, when my buddy called and said he'd gotten done with an open heart surgery early (usually, that's a very bad sign, but not today...he said everything went \"swimmingly\":) but after 12 hours of holding someone's life in his hands, he too was in need of a retox:)

We agreed that it was time to go see The Countess:)

I've seen a bunch of glowing reviews on good ol' Yelp and as I always do when I read the praise heaped on a particular place by my Yelp brethren and sistren, I thought \"I'll be the judge of that!\":)

Not that I don't trust the reviews...I do, or I wouldn't have jumped in the rig, pulled the belts tight and lit the turbocharger in order to get my retox going:)

No...\"trust, but verify\"...those words were given to all of us during an episode of Death Valley Days by a nearly washed up actor (whose name escapes me at the moment)... 

http://tinyurl.com/yfg9e39

Well, it's all true enough...the black mole chicken is subtle but spicy...the cochinita is saucy and inviting...the dog shark taco may be made with the only fish that travels well to the desert (no, don't get too excited...not the best fish taco I ever had...but very good:)

And more than enough to eat from an inexpensive platter of softball sized tacos (I know, I called The Countess \"cheap\" a few paragraphs ago, but what I meant was a solid value:)...Two big, round, tumescent taco's with rice and frijoles'...$7.59, USD:)

And plenty of salsa...oh yes...lots and lots of salsa...saucy, saucy salsa:)

None of the legendary \"strawberry salsa\" today (probably like the Yeti...plenty of sightings, but no actual evidence:)...but I didn't care...they still had a dozen salsas to choose from:)

And all the salsas seemed to complement my taco's...how is it even possible that Peanut Salsa and Smokey Chipotle Salsa BOTH taste exquisite with the moles and the pork shoulder?

I don't know...I asked my buddy...he's a trained physician and he didn't know either (so what good is he?...unless I need a heart transplant and then, you know...he's a god:)

As I contemplated all of the fresh and interesting selections available at the salsa bar, I thought to myself \"well, it's a bar, why don't I just pull up a chair and make a day of it?\" :-)

After The Countess herself came out and asked me to please eat at my own table and quit embarrassing myself and my lunch buddies, I remembered that this kind of thing is what got me banned from the Top of the Mark in San Francisco (although I will tell you what I told the SFPD...having a Caviar Bar with bar stools in close proximity is just asking for it:)

We finished our delightful lunch without further incident and agreed that this place should be much closer to our respective homes and open 24/7 so we can walk over and grab a burro or a platter of tacos whenever we feel like it...which would be pretty much every day, for at least 2 meals:)

Do you think The Countess will go for that?"}
{"text":"She is sweet, spicy, smooth, and exotic.

But don't talk about her like that, because she is La Santisima, and that means saintly, perv.

To her 16 salsas, I'm forever faithful. I can't even bring myself to eat a shrimp burrito or dogfish shark taco* from anywhere else.** 

I swear, I'm a one-burrito woman. Let La Santisima show you the light.

*No dogs/fish were harmed in the making of this taco. 
**dogfish shark tacos aren't available anywhere else around here, anyway."}
{"text":"Dayyyum! I'm not Mexican so you could cook a cat in mole and call it authentic and I'd believe it so if this place is authentic, good for them. It's not your run of the mill taco truck kind of food. Fancy tacos that are worth the price. I'm sad I don't live closer :( but I'd travel for another of their shrimp taco. Also, I'd recommend the mole taco...everything was really good. Beware about the guacamole at the salsa bar!!! It's beyond spicy! My tongue is still recovering from the scorch. The horchata is really something you've got to try too. Prepare to spend a weeks worth of groceries kind of money...but enjoy :)"}
{"text":"the service wasn't the greatest, but their salsa bar makes up for it... and their guacamole is the bees knees the place is rather small so it wouldn't be the best choice if you have a large group. also, get the horchata! it's really big and pretty sweet so it's something you could totally share with a friend :)"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food, would advise anyone in the area to try this.  We make it a point to go to Triple D restaurants and decided to give this a try and it did not disappoint.  It is a small venue with not much seating, but it is well worth the little wait that we had."}
{"text":"We will NEVER return. This was a TERRIBLE, AWFUL experience from beginning to end...service, food, everything has taken me from a patron who took out-of-towners here, to someone who will NEVER return to this location. Biggest offense - serving beef in the veggie tacos and burros - more than once to the same table, and other tables.

The scene: Friday evening ~6:30 pm. There are six 4-tops available, a long both (seating ~15) reserved with no one there yet, all but 1 table unoccupied on the patio, and the long table with 6-8 seats left. In other words, they were not full, no one ever waited for a table to finish before being seated. Despite this, the hostess (and waitress) looked around curiously wondering where to seat us? Anywhere would have worked, and so we were seated. As is custom, we quickly received tortilla chips and were welcomed to the salsa bar.

However, 20 minutes passed before our waitress returned to take our drink order. Based on this, we also placed our entree order. The waitress either has issues with getting the orders correct, or just likes to correct guest annunciations. For instance, the menu says quesa, so we say quesa and she has to repeat oh you mean quesadilla? Not sure why but we rolled with it. 

Another 5-10 minutes pass before everyone's drinks arrived (and some of the salsas are very spicy!). We had to ask for waters and were served warm water in clear plastic 12 ou solo cups. The table next to us actually received iced water in real glasses with beautiful blue rims. 

We witnessed another table receive their food, only to have half the food removed before two new entrees appeared They were served the wrong items. Huh. Kinda weird. That happened to me last time we were there, but they caught it before I could even take a bite. These people had begun eating and had to point out to the staff that there were issues. Wanna know the issues? BEEF in the VEGAN tacos. How did we find that out you may ask? Guess!

So, after at least 15 minutes (all our drinks are empty and were never asked if we wanted another cerveza or margarita or even sip of water), two of our four dinner entrees were served. Here's where I believe you Yelpers probably have guessed it - one of those was a VEGAN burro - served with BEEF! When we mentioned this to the waitress 7 minutes later refilling the tables drink order next to us. She apologized and mentioned that happened at another table too. She returned with a new (not grilled, kinda gross looking) burro.

Apparently there was a new chef. Yes, let's blame everything on him! More time passes and my entree (taco plate) contained a veggie la santisima taco (missing several listed ingredients such as onions and spinach) but only with cheese, mushrooms, and peppers, and BEEF! Yes there was beef on this too. Not much, but at least one piece is something suppose to be meat free. My shrimp cabo was SPECIFICALLY requested without sauce and it was covered. The waitress actually asked me if I could just pick it off. No, I cannot because the sauce is touching all the cheese and cabbage and I paid for an entire taco. The beans and rice were horrible too, the rice tasted plain, no flavor with bland corn. The beans tasted like watered down gruel - no taste, no seasoning. And last time - I devoured the beans and rice because they were tasty. No amount of salsa bar could fix these tastes today.

So, how about that fourth entree? After the first two people FINISHED their entire meal (one Churro in the Quesa section) then the 4th entree appeared. What about that replaced veggie burro - BEEF in it AGAIN!

You can blame a chef for mixing up orders at a table. But, can you continue blaming the chef when you serve the wrong food to every table? We watched as 2 more tables received incorrect entrees. Oh, and the large party arrived after our troubles began. I can't forgive a wait staff that doesn't know how to handle these situations-wrong food, long wait times, inconsistent timing, beef served to vegetarians. You cannot serve vegetarians meat in the burro - twice. Come on now! Why are all the veggie la satisima missing half the ingredients and containing meat????? 

There were some rushed apologies, but no call to action. Asking me if I'd like another taco after we pay is more like salt on the wound than a bandaid. I loved this place our first visit. We couldn't wait to take our parents here. We REGRET deeply what they had to endure and wish to warn others that the salsa bar is NOT worth all the other troubles. We were charged for all the food - even the food that couldn't be eaten (Shrimp cabo, Veggie Burro) and for food that appeared after most people finished their meal at our table of four. 

We will NEVER, EVER return to this location and cannot think of how the manager would even attempt to rectify this situation."}

{"text":"Seriously amazing food. Salsa bar for whatever you need. Food was very well priced and service was friendly! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best food I've eaten. Even the tortilla was superb! Any downside with limited parking and a slightly cramped dining area are quickly forgotten when you take your first bite. There is a great selection of salsas at their salsa bar, ranging from mild and tasty to hot hot hot and tasty. Staff are pros and friendly and will help with the menu if your not sure what to order or if you have any questions. They also seem perfectly willing to make accommodations if you ask for substitutions or additions to your order. This is a definite must try place, cause you'll love it."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this location , the service here was so bad . Came on a Sunday not really busy at al , took them 40 mins for us to get a table when I could l see open tables ( more then 3) . Then when we sat down it took over an hour to get our food . The food was good nothing bad to say about the food . Just the service. The Glendale location was so much better . I will never come here again , I will drive out of my way to Glendale next time ."}
{"text":"A plate with 3 tacos, a scoop of rice and a lick of re-fried beans was $15 dollars! I ordered a michelada after seeing the pictures of it here on yelp (which let me add that the michelada was not even on the menu) and that thing costs $12 dollars... for 1 beer and some clamato juice in it!

I saw of bunch of plaques on the well for \"best of....\" this and best of that, including a 2012 \"cheap eats of phoenix\". I interpret that plaque as something having to do with \"low prices\" however, it seems like the restaurant totally moved away from low cost!

taking away the cost factor, i think the food is good. i ordered a Marlin, Cochinita Pibil and barbacoa taco which were all great and my wife ordered a \"lonche\" with skirt steak which was also good. the salsa bar does have great salsas but they're watered down... it can't even be scooped, you can only \"wet\" your chips in it and if you add it to your food be ready for your tortilla or lonche to fall apart ... they might as well serve the salsa on a cup with a straw so you can sip on it as you eat!

There's one plaque that this restaurant deserves to have on the wall... the one that says \"Best use of a small space\" tables are so close to one another, it gets really crammed in there.

{"text":"Terrific food -- and very creative! Loved the peanut based salsa and chicken tinga taco! Service was a bit slow, but we did arrive right as a rush began. Also def recommend the Margarita Santisima! Yum!"}
{"text":"I've held off on writing this review because I knew that to sit down, revisit my visit in my head, and dream of the flavors would hurt my heart. There is NO Mexican food in Hawaii. I repeat, there is NO Mexican food in Hawaii. Don't let anyone fool you...there is NO Mexican food in Hawaii. See, now my heart is already aching. 

It was 10:20 PM on a Saturday night when I touched down in Phoenix. Somehow, I made it out of the airport before 11 PM and that is how my journey to La Santisima began...

Hurry up, catch a Taxi, and Yelp the nearest, best Mexican food that is still open! BOOM, La Santisima! 

Arrive to La Santisima with my colleague at 10:58 PM. Okay, I know it's fucked up. Let's be real. This is the nightmare for anyone working in any kind of customer service. \"Oh you want help right when I am in the middle of ending my day? No really, ENDING my day in 2 minutes. Please get the hell away from me.\" 

We knew we were taking a chance, we knew they might not seat us, or even let us order food to go. We walked in, with our luggages, and we saw the jaws drop. \"Yes, hi...we just got off a 7 hour flight and we are very hungry. Can you help us?\" 

We see that half the tables are already stacked up but after a sigh, they seat us. Mind you, there was another couple in there WAITING for the rest of their food. Praise Jesus, hallelujah! 

The menus were handed to us promptly and in the same motion, we apologized for coming in so late. The very nice man, I think the owner or at the very least, the manager, said not to worry and that the kitchen wasn't done being put away so take a moment. 

Right away, my eyes fell onto the word \"Cabo.\" What can I say? My last trip to Mexico was very good to me. Cabo Tacos it was! My colleague ordered 3 different tacos and we both ordered the horchata. 

Now, this is where you may say that we were so damn hungry and that saying this was the BEST Mexican food we have EVER had is an overstatement but no, it's not. We both lived in California previously and we are both well-traveled. This was the bombest of the bomb. Is that a phrase? Better than any food I had my whole time in Cabo, too. 

The Cabo Tacos were fried lightly, fresh, and piping hot. The slaw was perfectly crispy and cool. The tortillas were soft. The rice...oh my god...the rice...If Heaven is just clouds of this rice...I'm down with it. 

The salsa bar didn't have as many options left at 11 PM, understandably so, but what was left, was great. There was a peanut sauce and radish sauce that still stick out in my head. I wish I could have had them both bottled up and shipped to me. 

Anyways, WHAT NICE FREAKING PEOPLE. They let us sit down at 10:58 PM and happily served us food, waited to clean the salsa bar until they saw we didn't need/want anymore, and gave us the biggest freaking horchatas in a to-go cup. The horchata had a bunch of fruit in it. I've never seen it or tasted it like that before. Magic. Better than tequila. That's a bold statement coming from me...

I love you chef, bus boy, and boss man. I love you and I miss you and I love you and I miss your food."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. I consider myself a bit of a taco fan and this place keeps me happy! Also the salsa bar is pretty creative. Only complaints are if you order their amazing horchata, it only comes in one size which is a bucket and the other complaint is they only provide 1 small basket of chips per table, any more will cost ya like $2!?! Forget the chips and spend that on another taco!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food - had the different veggie tacos and the cactus taco. A plethora of vegetables cooked just right. The rice and beans were the best, THE BEST, I've ever had. Also, One outstanding veggie quesadilla. What !!!

I'm not even a fan of Mexican food but this was pretty damn good !

So many colorful unique flavorful sauces and salsas helped a lot. Really really delicious.

The chips were good too, not greasy at all 
Hot hats drink had nuts and fruits in it which I ate with a fork afterwards...

Service was good. There were two servers and they handled it well. Alan took care of us and he was friendly professional and nice and efficient. 

When we came in, the place had three tables. By the time we left it was packed and there were people waiting outside on the bench and inside at the bar. 

We parked around the corner in the white spaces.
The place has a cool exterior and a cool interior. 
I'll add a photo of two

Enjoy, folks, this one is a winner..."}
{"text":"I had lived in Phoenix my whole life and had never been here until recently.  My first visit was a great experience and I highly recommend the shark tacos and horchata. Parking isn't always easy, but it's definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Hunting for authentic Mexican food??  La Santisima is the REALS!! They have over a dozen salsas in their salsa bar and let you help yourself with the complimentary basket of chips.  I ordered (2) Carne Asada and (1) Al Pastor taco and added the rice and beans for a total of $8.97.  Let me start by saying your food comes out piping hot on a hot plate.  The food is made fresh and it shows.  The refried beans were delicious, really creamy, and flavorful. The rice was not dry and also way above average in taste.  The Asada was so flavorful and tender. Definitely better than most places I frequent. The beef was not chewy at all and has an almost melt in your mouth consistency.  The Al Pastor was also amazing with all fresh ingredients including the pineapple.  If you're in the Coronado area, do yourself a favor and check out this little gem!"}
{"text":"This place has been bookmarked for well over a year. I finally got to try them out recently, and on Taco Tuesday, no less!

I love that they allow you to mix and match different tacos to create your own taco plate.  I ordered the following 3 tacos:

Tlaloc (grilled cactus, caramelized onion, garlic, jalapeños; I omitted the additional options for this taco -tomato, mushrooms, and queso fresco)

Guisado Tenoch (Grilled Cactus, Potato, Guajillo & red salsa; I omitted the mushrooms and queso fresco)

Mexica Ahuacatl (Beer Battered Avocado, cabbage, salsa jicama; I omitted the pico de gallo and the salsa cilantro, the latter of which contains dairy)

The Guisado Tenoch & Mexica Ahuacatl were by far my favorites.  The Guisado is terrifically tantalizing to the tastebuds and needed no extra salsas.  The Ahuacatl was equally delicious once I added some Strawberry Salsa. (It's delicious alone, just a little dry w/o the salsa.)  I wasn't a fan of the flavors in the Tlaloc, which were too tart and robust to my liking. Just a personal preference. 

I ordered my plate with rice and black beans, and I mixed them together.  The flavor of the beans was delightful; they were seasoned perfectly, and not too salty.  (It's my understanding that the refried beans contain dairy, so vegans should stick to the black beans.)

Another shining star here is the unlimited salsa bar, which features about a dozen different salsas.  The salsa ingredients are not listed, but after spotting a particularly milky looking one, I inquired and discovered that there are a few salsas which do contain dairy, including the pecan salsa and cilantro salsa.  I have since been informed that the following salsas are all vegan: salsa 7 chiles, árbol, cabo, chipotle, sesame, peanut, strawberry, pico de gallo, jicama, cruda, tomatillo, rábano, and the Mexicana. The guacamole is also confirmed as vegan.  The strawberry salsa became an unexpected favorite, winning me over with its refreshingly sweet and spicy flavors. 

The service was great and I absolutely adore the wall art.  The only thing I do not like is that the bathroom is in the dining area and several people kept leaving the door open... The salsa bar is right outside that door. As an OCD germaphobe, I was terribly bothered by this.  Aside from that, I love this taqueria and cannot wait to return and try the rest of their vegan menu."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican restaurant with the most authentic Jalisco cuisine around.  Highly recommended.  Suggest the caso with pineapple and pork."}
{"text":"The best service, great food,and a very friendly staff. A great restaurant close to downtown Glendale"}
{"text":"I really like the choices of salsa. They give you some interesting flavours and textures by using pecans and jicama. As weird as it sounds, it's worth trying it out to discover new things and it might surprise you like it did me. 
When I came here, I was a little disappointed because they didn't have any shrimps so I couldn't get one of the tacos I wanted. I ended up getting  the Baja Sur Shark Taco and another taco. Both were very good, but I did prefer the Shark Taco. I also had their horchata which was just okay...it had too much cinnamon for me, but I like the addition of fruits and nuts with it. 
This place gets crowded especially during lunch time and it's a small place. They've got interesting paintings on the walls."}
{"text":"I like a lot. Good selection of food... spotty service, rough but ambient location. A little grungy, but I will be back."}
{"text":"Wen there on a Friday night at almost 9 PM and had a 5 minute wait for a single seat. Service was very welcoming and fast. Upon being seated, I was given a basket of complementary chips, (1st basket is free), I sat there waiting for salsa and forgot that there is a salsa bar with numbers of salsa to try out. I've decided to order just tacos and all were delicious. In order of best to least favorite was shrimp taco, fish taco, Aztec tinga taco (chicken), and finally a Sonoran carne asada. I highly recommend this place for anyone who enjoy tacos. I've seen neighboring tables had huge burritos and decent sized serving of margaritas, which I would love to try on the next visit."}
{"text":"There are several reviews here that state that the service is poor - I humbly disagree. While it may take a few minutes to get your order, the atmosphere and the servers are awesome. Our waitress was fantastic from the get-go. To top it off, the food is unbelievable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! You'd never known it from the outside---it's a little hole in the wall on Calle 16 right in the middle of Mexican mercados y paleterias. It's tiny so expect at least a 30 minute wait at peak hours. They have a serve yourself salsa bar with some of the most unique salsas I have ever tasted---from strawberry to pecan to habanero. The menu is not your typical Mexican food but there isn't a single bad thing on it. Don't bother with rice and beans on the side-- not needed. Try the mole quesa-- its my absolute favorite. The horchata is a family recipe with fruit and pecans in it and its amazingggg and a great big size option. You won't be disappointed in this incredible spot."}
{"text":"LOVE the dogfish shark taco and the chicken mole taco. The salsa bar is awesome. The horchata is delicious. Perfect tacos at a reasonable price. But the restaurant is small, so avoid peak times or get your food to go."}
{"text":"Great gourmet tacos! Recommend the brisket one on the street taco menu. The pecan salsa is very tasty as well! Classic margarita-phenomenal! Wonderful lunch spot."}
{"text":"Get there early because it might get packed later. Food comes very slowly but it is worth waiting. Definitely best tacos we ate so far, recommend trying their signature santissima gourmet! There is a big choice in the fresh salsa bar and the whole place has a nice decor inspired by dia de los Muertos."}
{"text":"I was craving street tacos and this place is as close to the street tacos you will get in Rocky Point. It's a small quaint place but they have such a variety of different salsas I didn't even know existed. The corn tortillas were fresh and the carne asada tacos were extremely on point. 
I'll be coming back here sooner than you think just to get my taco fix!"}
{"text":"Stopped for what I heard was excellent tacos from many people. They were so right!   Hands down, best tacos. I had the fish and chicken Tinga taco and my daughter had the Carne Asada tacos. My came with the most moist and flavorful rice with a lighter side of beans. The chips were served warm and we had a variety of salsas for dipping. The standout salsa has to be the smooth and creamy cilantro. Soooo goooood.  Ok, the fish taco was served with coleslaw. The corn tortilla was doubled and made to perfection. Probably the best fish taco I ever ate. I will dine here again before I leave Phoenix. 

Well, came back for dinner and was not disappointed. Tacos rice and beans were delicious. I had a brisket taco that was grilled in shell with seasoning and sautéed onions on the exterior of shell. Yum. This will be a regular stop every time I'm in Phoenix. I've been cooking for years and don't know How do they cook the rice??? It's so good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the salsa bar from the Mexicana to the 7 chile's one.  I had the 3 street  taco meal with rice and beans.  Meats I chose were carne  asada, mayan pibil and the Aztec  tingi. The carne asada was dry and not flavorful and i didn't enjoy the taste of the tingi taco.  the last taco made it all worth it the Mayan pibil was delicious and I can't wait to have this again. They marinate the red onions in lemon, this simple touch makes the tacos so much better.  Javier had the red beef burrito this was very spicy but he enjoyed it.  We also had the house Margarita. They put lemons and orange slices in the drink.  This was an excellent margarita and for 8.00, I think this was a great deal. Our total bill for 2 meals, 2 beers and a Margarita was 37.00. The only down side to this place was the old plates. They were not the glossy ones and had chips and paint missing. I know it goes with the decor but i think this could be worked on.  We will be returning to try more food from this taco shop."}
{"text":"I've been in to La Condesa twice now, both during their happy hour. If you're not aware of their happy hour, familiarize yourself with it. It's pretty damned good ($3 delicious margaritas and $2 chicken tinga or carne asada tacos). 
To start, there is the salsa bar. You get one basket of chips (any more than that you pay for, but my wife and I never eat more than 1 basket-full) and then there are about 16-20 different types of salsa and sauces to try. I've only been brave enough to try about 5 of them, and they've all been decent-really good. My favorite was their tomatillo, and their chipotle didn't really do it for me, but I don't usually enjoy the taste of chipotle peppers in general. Too smokey.
The first time I went I got 2 carne asada tacos and 1 chicken tinga taco. I was disappointed in the carne asada. The meat was dry and topped with dry shredded cabbage. It has a decent flavor, but I had to put salsa on it because it was too dry for me. The chicken tinga, on the other hand, was pretty fabulous. The chicken has a very flavorful sauce on it with good spice, and it's topped with pickled red onion. Fantastic. I also had a plate of rice and beans which were delicious as well. So, the second time I went in, I ordered only chicken tacos. No biggie.
I highly recommend checking this place out. 5 tacos, 2 margaritas, and some rice and beans for $20. Brilliant."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about La Santisima! One of my favorite restaurants for sure! Sure it gets busy but the waitresses that work there are ALWAYS sweet and positive. The food never disappoints me. I always order the Jamaica or Horchata and the street tacos with the beans and rice."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal. Horchata is the best in town. Love the cozy atmosphere but on a busy night it can be a little too intimate with strangers squeezing and bumping through to tables. Choose a weeknight late or early dinner to avoid."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing tacos and drinks. I'm an Arizona Native. This place has not been influenced by the Midwesterners and snowbirds so the food is still full of flavor and spice. Great salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Cant wait to go again. Really great salsa bar, and lots of choices on the menus. Hubby was a bit apprehensive about going but he enjoyed it"}
{"text":"I LOVE La Condesa.  What more do I need to say? The salsa bar is amazing! I really like their carne asada.  They do but beans in the burrito, which, at first I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it, but after a couple, I really like it.  I've had the pork and shrimp tacos also.  The quality is always top notch.  I did the artwork too!  Two negatives...The music can sometimes be loud, and sometimes they are REALLY packed and parking is a bit tough to find.  Other than that, I HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"The foods is amazing and the mole is out of this world.  I will be back many times. My husband had the fish tacos abs he said they are great."}
{"text":"Very good. From the hot chips to the variety  of salsas great flavors. I had the steak taco and shrimp taco excellent  seasoning, piping hot and nice waiter."}
{"text":"I had the gaucho taco (chimichurri beef something or other) and the cochinita pibil taco. 

Honestly amazing food. 

Really interesting assortment of sauces and salsas (jicama salsa, peanut sauce stuff was great.) Looks like they just recently added some awesome new tequilas so I'm looking forward to stopping by at dinner time. Really authentic stuff. Looks like they just had Diners Dives and Drive ins there as there was a cool metal art piece signed by Guy Fieri.
Food came out quickly despite lunch rush. I'll be back soon. 
Recommended to people looking for authentic places to make their more boring friends jealous of their foodie acumen."}
{"text":"Best salsa bar in Phoenix
Amazing tacos
Always a wait in the evenings and you can't even order drinks at the bar while you wait which kind of sucks."}
{"text":"This was a little hole in the wall spot, looked sketchy. The insides not much better but has some nice art. The food was great! A fresh salsa bar with flavored like cilantro and strawberry salsa. I had a type of corn quesadilla with steak and Mexican cheeses, all GF. It was thick and puffy, tasty!"}
{"text":"The place is a little small so we had to wait a bit for a table. The food is fantastic. 

Steak asada tacos were perfect. Nice chunks of meat with shredded cabbage. 

We also had the black mole tacos. Also outstanding. 

The selection of self-serve sauces is the standout.  They have maybe 20 sauces for you to sample. The variety and quality of the sauces is excellent and should satisfy any palate. 

If I'm ever back in Phoenix I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place for salsa, tacos and quesadillas. I had street tacos, very good, different and fresh. My friend had a quesadilla that looked more like a calzone. It was superb. Tried about 10 salsas, fun to try then all. Loved the cilantro salsa. Small place and lots of people so try to go outside of the noon hour."}
{"text":"Gourmet tacos from abuela's kitchen, an off the beat location in Little Mexico. The well ornate sit in resturant has a great vibe, bright colorful art work and a strong Dia de Muerto sets the right mood. Service is great and simple, from the self serve salsa bar to the strong drinks menu, adds to the home feel.

La Santisima's staple taco is a must have. Nicely toasted cheese over well seasoned steak makes for a great combination.  The roasted peppers and onions add a nice balance and grilled mushrooms just work. Not much on sauce but the beef and vegetables highlight the entree. 

Mayan cochinta was loaded with flavor. Tender and savory pork shoulder has a ton of favor, the pickled onions help add a zing to the dish. Recommend you have it over a plate cause it'll ooze down you hand."}
{"text":"We have been HUGE fans of this place since the first location in Phoenix. We love both locations. We always bring friends and family. Everyone adds this place to their list for amazing tacos...especially the tiger shrimp tacos! There is no better place to get Chimichuri Beef  (Argentinian Marinade). Fantastic food and beautiful art what a great combination."}
{"text":"La Santisima is delightful from start to finish They have a buffet of salsas available from guacamole to peanut to strawberry to....kimchi salsa?! It was heaven. 

Highly recommend the quesadillas. They are deep fried to a perfection. The rice/beans that come with the tacos are out of this world and the horchata is also incredible--and strawberry infused!"}
{"text":"I went here to use a Groupon a couple weeks ago (can't believe I forgot to review it!). We got there fairly early and the place was empty. I found that to be kind of awkward. Anyway, The BF and I both got taco plates. I got the pork and the gaucho tacos. The pork was alright, very tender and the flavor was decent - a little sweet a little spicy, but the gaucho was pretty not good. There was something incredibly sweet about it...I did not like it at all, and I love chimichurri sauce. Their salsa bar is fabulous! I liked the pecan salsa and the tomatillo. I thought the strawberry salsa was odd...not my cup of tea. The salsa was the best part of the meal. I also had the horchata.....I did not care for it. The fruit and nuts in it did not add to the flavor and it was served luke warm...not so good. I do not know that I would go back."}
{"text":"Everything positive I read about this place came true as I entered. Although service started out a little slow at first-I think I was just really hungry, the food was phenomenal. Their salsa bar was nothing short of awesome offering a wide variety of flavors and heat to appeal to anyone. The margarita.......pretty potent but delicious.

I ordered a variety of three soft tacos with rice and beans and sliced avocado. Pretty authentic. LOVED it!! If you love true Mexican meals, try this place. It looks like a hole in the wall from the exterior, but usually that's where you find the jeweled spots. Anyway, I cleaned my plate despite being very stuffed from the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I have been to La Santisma about four times.  Their wide range of tacos and salsas make it a must for anyone looking to go beyond your regular Arizona Mexican Food.  This place is a very hip establishment with lovely art and décor reflecting the Mexican American culture.  The tacos themselves are quite delicious.  I had difficulty deciding on what to eat because everything looked delicious!  The salsa bar has something to suit everyone's tastes. If you want something mild, medium, or hot, they have it.  

This place is not a secret, and space is limited.  Be prepared to wait for seating if coming during dinner hours.

My only issue with La Santisma is that they charge for refills on tortilla chips.  I understand that they are running a business and giving out unlimited chips could be detrimental to the bottom line.  However, with so many delicious salsas available, it would be nice to be able to have some refills to really take them all in and pick a favorite.

I give La Santisma 4 stars due to décor and quality of food."}
{"text":"This place is good but I hate that they don't have fountain drinks and they go by can of soda. Also the last time I went the waitress took forever to order our food and helped another table before us that got there after us."}
{"text":"In Phoenix there is nobody more important than the person who takes care of your A/C.  Mechanical M D deserves more than 5 stars.  He is available when he needs to be, gets things done quickly and will actually repair things rather than just take the easy route and replace them.  He tries to protect your wallet and that is unusual.  I didn't even think to mention \"trustworthy\".  That is getting harder to come by these days.  Next time you have A/C problems just call Mechanical M D and don't worry."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall but amazing quesadilla!!! The tacos were alright, the star of this restaurant would definitely have to be the quesadilla, you can't go here and not order one or two or THREE!! Lol the bread/crust/dough if the quesadilla is amazing! The salsa bar for the nachos they provide while you wait for your food is fun and there are some good selections, esp the cilantro one and I don't even like cilantro."}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow but the wait was well worth it. The tacos were outstanding and the tortilla soup was the best I've had. My daughters had burros which were also excellent. I will be back whenever I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Super yummy taco spot. There selections of salsas and sauces is amazing. Many traditional and many very unique ones I've never tasted before -peanut salsa?! Our tacos were all delicious and they came out of the kitchen pretty quick. Definitely left my belly very full and happy. Highly recommend checking out this spot."}
{"text":"I would say what a great find, but it's already been found.  Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had... And I've had a lot. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Really liked this place.  Came here due to the other Yelpers and it didn't disappoint.  Had their signature non alcoholic drink and it was delicious.

Couldn't believe the amount of salsa's.  Hard to pick my favorite but I truly enjoyed them all.

If you are in the area, definitely stop in.  Not a big place at all, and the area isn't the best, but worth the trip!

You can tell it is very well cared for and the food is made fresh and with a ton of love."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The have any type of fresh salsa you could imagine. The energy and decor makes you feel welcome as well as the staff. We had the street tacos and they were amazing! My favorite was the Al Pastor. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"From my experience up to this point this place is hands down the best taco shop in PHX.  The salsa bar is awesome with a ton of options and their street tacos along with the gourmet tacos are great."}
{"text":"Authentic food is so lacking in our culture today.  This is a rare find for excellent, native Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food: very good...  authentic and worth visiting.  Maybe better to go. 

Service: SUCKS.   Incompetent people who don't know how to operate a restaurant.   When I walked in, there were 10 people in line - many \"couples\".   There was an open table for two at the front of the restaurant.  I approached the hostess (incompetent) about the table she said, \"we are not using the table\" followed by something about not wanting to overwhelm the wait staff.   Then, 5 minutes later she went back and talked to a waiter about the table.  She then proceeded to have a party sit down.  Really?

Overall experience:  I was there for over an hour just trying to get two tacos.   Food came out lukewarm probably because it was sitting in the kitchen waiting to come out.  Overall, service with waiter was pathetic.   The people here don't know what they are doing and should go to school to learn how to run a restaurant like a business.  

My (Hispanic) friend always says, \"Mexican restaurants are not known for service\".  This restaurant epitomizes this statement."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. With a few exceptions, I've tried most of the menu and I can say that everything is superb. The quesadillas have a hand-made corn tortilla that is almost like a pastry. Whether it's filled with al pastor or arrachera steak, it will not disappoint. The cochinita pibil and chicken tinga are also do-not-miss items. 

The fresh salsa bar has some very unique and delicious offerings, in particular the pecan, strawberry, and chile de arbol salsas.

The service is always super friendly and the decor is very inviting. 

I sincerely look forward to enjoying La Condesa for years to come!"}
{"text":"Slow service, but we'll worth the wait! El pastor street tacos are AMAZING!! Salsa bar is also very good with some really unique salsas. Rice and beans are nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Lots of options, cool/hip smallish place, great vibe....

Salsa bar killed it, and service was quick.  

Just what you want."}
{"text":"Amazing food! You cannot beat their salsa bar! But their wait staff is the worst part of this place. Honestly, every time I've gone here, I've had to wait about an hour after ordering to get my food. The taste is great but honestly it's a waste of time  to wait so long for the food."}
{"text":"Great Food! The numerous fresh made salsas at the salsa bar we all flavorful and tasty, even when they brought the heat.  That is how I judge a good salsa. If you bring the heat ... The flavor better be there too!  Really liked the Salsa Pecan!

The fried quesadillas are wonderful. Loved the Al Pastor.  The burritos are well portioned and full of meat 

They need to work on servers being more attentive.  Even when they are \"in the weeds.\"  They were obviously down a person given the way tables were not getting cleared quickly."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Everything we tried was good.  Had the best horchata of my life, which has fruit bits and deliciousness in it. Great salsa bar. All around goodness."}
{"text":"Order at the counter and decided to try lots. Street tacos were good but not the best I've had. Quesadilla with shrimp and chilies was amazing. Chips and all the salsas were great and the guacamole with cranberries was also very good and a nice change. Margarita was very good. Downside was the paper lined baskets and plastic utensils for eating. I'd go back but didn't leave raving like so many others."}
{"text":"This place definitely has a unique concept (Santísima) which I didn't care for, the vibe was a lil dark for my taste. But overall the food I didn't love the meat wasn't that great either and the service was ok could have been a lot better."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall place. Be aware it is tiny, and there will likely be a waiting list. Totally worth the wait. Try the quesadillas or Burritos. Margarita was a bit too sweet, but otherwise a great little place. Very very affordable."}
{"text":"My husband and I would go here every week since they opened.. But it seems as though since the owner hasn't been in the place lately the restaurant is going down hill... The 2 waitresses have a very poor attitude... Last week we went the girl waitress had an attitude and told my sister in law they were out of rice & michelada's!  Went back today and the waitresses would not even wait on us! Another couple sat next to us and they give them menus & chips!!! We waited 20 minutes before walking out! Mind you have been loyal customers since they opened their doors! The food was great but has gone down hill!"}
{"text":"Smallish, but very interesting tacos and burrito place. Larger portions than I expected - two tacos with rice and beans was plenty. But I forgot to post this when I first wrote it and I can't remember the details. But I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Best salsa bar in town by far.  Stand outs to me would be the 7 chile, and the Pecan.  The Cabo Shrimp and the Mole tacos would be my favorite tacos.  And best of all is this place just doubled in size, so that should make wait times much shorter.  A great place to take any out of town guests to get some wonderful authentic Mexican cuisine!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been here a few times but it's our most recent visit that truly inspired me to write a review. I know most of us look only at the tacos and ignore everything else on the menu. Big mistake!! My friend decided to order the al pastor quesa while I decided to stick to tacos. Their vegetarian taco section caught my eye and I ordered the cauliflower al pastor. I also ordered their potato and chorizo taco which I absolutely love. 

Their extensive salsa bar is always a delight. Although, most of their sauces tend to skew spicy. It works for me, so no complaints there. Our food arrived and the chorizo taco was phenomenal, as I expected. But the real winner that evening was the quesa. Bless the lord! This is one of the best things I have ever tasted at a Mexican restaurant. The meat was incredibly flavorful with an opulence of cheese (again, not complaining). The crust itself was beautifully flaky and crisp. I have had dreams about this quesa after that evening. If you ever visit this restaurant, consider skipping the tacos (which are actually pretty great) and order the quesa. You will not regret it. I feel I should quickly mention the cauliflower \"al pastor\". This was one the saddest things of the evening. Huge chunks of barely cooked cauliflower thrown on a taco with some sauce. Meh! The quesa, however, outdid all my expectations. So I'm still giving this 5 stars. I will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for lunch.  I had read about the salsa bar and so was looking forward to trying as many salsas as possible.

The server let us try 3 of the taco fillings before we chose.  We then had the chicken, the pork, the Gaucho and the shrimp and shared them - all were very good.

We tried all the hot salsas (no strawberry for us!) and they were decent (not Mrs. Renfro's Ghost Pepper Salsa hot, but decent enough).

The prices were very reasonable and I would for sure go back if I was in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"I came here not knowing how popular it was, but sadly left not understanding why. The service was bad, the waitress visited our table twice. The food was good, and so was the horchata. But better service would be the only way I would consider going back."}
{"text":"This place has great reviews with good reason. This place is really small, so either be prepared to wait, or go during an off time. But oh man is it worth the wait!! The food isn't what you get at the usual Sonoran style Mexican joints in Phoenix, it's got a variety of food from all over Mexico. I've tried about half the tacos, and I couldn't even decide on a favorite!! They are all soooo good! And no trip to La Santisima would be complete without a glass of the infamous horchata"}
{"text":"REALLY great salsa bar selection here! I would go here strictly for that reason alone. The food here is great. The drinks are delicious as well. They hand make the cocktails with love and use real fruit. I had the blueberry martini and there were so many fresh blueberries in it I could barely finish it haha! My hubby got the horchada with rum...it tasted like a pina colada! Yum yum. In a rougher part of town, but this is definitely our new go to spot for Mexican food when driving to/from the airport back up to North Scottsdale :)"}
{"text":"We stopped in on July 4th for lunch. We were told we could sit wherever we wanted. 
The server walked over and asked for a drink order. He later brought chips and let us know they had a salsa bar.

We walked over and they have a big selection. We tried several and they were very tasty. We ordered the fried quesadilla with chicken and beans and rice and an order of guacamole.

The quesadilla was amazing. The chicken was cooked perfectly and it was spicy. The refried beans were the best I have ever had, I just wished the side was bigger than the small cup it was served in.

Everything was excellent, except the service was a little slow. We had to ask for water, silverware and an extra plate a couple of times before it was brought over. But, the food definitely made up for it. Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!  As other reviewers have pointed out, the salsa bar is insane.  Do yourself a favor and sample each variety.  They're not labeled to indicate how spicy they are, so be forewarned.  The cochinita, gaucho, dogfish, and shrimp tacos are my favorite."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm very pleased and impressed with this spot .. I was raised and born in California and just moved to Arizona .. This place reminds me of my parents come cooked food and what I love more was that they serve the food in the clay plates ! Platos de baro are the best !"}
{"text":"I've had some delicious Mexican food here in Phoenix.  But this place trumps all.  A stocked salsa bar, delicious fish tacos.  Seriously, what isn't good here?  I'm going to keep going here and trying a different menu item every time just to see if something is subpar here.  I'll put my savings on it that there isn't a single thing that isn't good here.  I'd probably go here just for the chips and salsa if Mexican food isn't your thing, but your coworker or spouse or some guy or girl you're going on a date with insists on La Santisima.  Just go.  No excuses.  Nothing.  And order the chips and salsa.  Try every salsa.  I don't care how strange pecan salsa or strawberry salsa sounds...trust me, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. The food is unlike any other place in town. The enchiladas are thick. The salsa bar is great. The only problem is that it is small, so it can get crowded quick."}
{"text":"the staff  is very friendly, this food is fantastic and the salsa bar is amazing. Ever since the expansion seating is a lot easier"}
{"text":"Yelp helped me find this gem. Every part of the meal was delish from the salsa bar, house margarita, to the street tacos. The staff was very friendly as well. It is a very small location and I went during off hours, it worked perfectly."}
{"text":"I couldn't put off my ravenous feelings anymore after leaving work the other night and pulled over at La Condesa. I had been meaning to try it for quite some time. So what if I was a party of one. Satiation is more important than social appearances. The place is in a mildly sketchy area next to a little market that sells pinatas and a few groceries. To me, this actually lended the place some street cred. Anyway, I like how the restaurant's interior has none of the feeling of a Baja Fresh or Chipotle yet the prices are pretty reasonable. The dining room doesn't look like it can fit too many people so I'm wondering what it's like on weekends. The bathrooms were reasonably clean and I got a kick out of the whole lucha libre motif in the bano for the chicas. 

I had a pork mole burro with the mole made with chocolate and nuts. Muy sabrosos but the meat was a tad salty or too kicky, not sure if it was the tanginess or salt that had me asking for more water. But I think that is more a matter of personal taste buds, not the reflection on the cooking. I found the meat quite tender. And I felt like a wimp only being able to eat half the burro. Next time, I will probably do the two-taco deal. There was only one gal doing all the bills and service. She was quite nice. 

But what will make me come back again is their awesome salsa buffet. It makes the salsa trays at chain restaurants look like plainer, less adventurous salsitas. I had the strawberry salsa (sweet yet salty), jicama, cilantro (my favorite but found if you have too much too soon, you'll feel lit) and peanut. It got to the point where I had to tell myself \"no more chips\" so I simply sucked the salsa off a chip like it was a spoon. Yup, it reduced me to that. Anyway, I do need to go back and get some more ideas of the food. But for now, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall...aren't those the best places??  Unique variety of tacos and a salsa bar.  The place is small, so off times or weeknights are best!"}
{"text":"Been searching for good quality authentic Mexican food? Well, look no further. This place is the best in the state of AZ.  They use good quality freeh ingredients to prepare the food. Everything from the tacos, burritos and quesadillas are superb. They have a salsa bar with many different salsas that are to die for!!! Oh and don't forget to try the horchata. You won't be dissapointed after eating at this place!"}
{"text":"Shrimp fundito. Oh lord. Five stars. Five stars, five stars, five stars! So much delicious cheese with shrimp, butter, garlic, delicious tortillas. Order this. This is everything. Our server was sweet and fab as can't be. I got the pastor quesa and it was so good. My sisters got the mahi burro and a variety of street tacos. The little ones snacked on our food and had a quesadilla to go. One of the other servers unknowingly handed it to the wrong table, but they were so kind and remade her meal--plus she had the amazing horchata. She did not want to share, so she was mostly concerned about keeping her little brother at bay! The quesadilla was so flavorful. I love the larger than usual chunks of pineapple, and the cranberries in the chopped guacamole was so nice and bright. I expected more cheese after the shrimp fundito, but I'm a cheese person. The burrito was killer and came in second. The street tacos were well seasoned, carne asada was deliciously tender. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I go hear frequently and have known that the waitresses and service is not very good but still went because the food was great. Tonight I went and the burritos were smaller and was missing ingredients, didn't taste as good. They normally put a small salad with cranberries, avacados, tomatoes, and lettuce, this time it was just tomatoes and lettuce. My boyfriend order a large salad(mind you, the last time we ordered this salad we shared it with three other people) when they brought it out it looked like a side salad! I couldn't believe it. The waitress said that they changed the sizes and that she would bring us more because we weren't told this. We waited and she never did. I finally had to ask her if she was still bringing it before she brought it. If the food and service continues to be this way I will not be dining here anymore"}
{"text":"First off this is a Oaxaca style type of \"Mexican\" food. Get similar with the style. 

My friend and I do taco Tuesday every week and we have seen great reviews about La Santisima. So glad we decided to give this place a shot. 

We started with agua de Horchata. It was so sweet (good sweet) & different from a typical Horchata; which had strawberries and almonds mixed in. Our appetizer was Queso Fundido with chorizo. The queso is a Oaxaxa cheese, which is very thick and comes on a very hot plate with flour tortillas. We really enjoyed the cheese. Yum!

The gourmet tacos section had a variety of tacos at 3.99 each (which is on the pricey side for me) and street tacos for 2.55 each. Because we like to live on the edge we decided to go gourmet this evening. The best deal is just to get the plate for 8.95 which includes 2 tacos (same tacos) with rice and beans. I ordered the Wild Tiger Shrimp, which was breaded topped with cabbage and some type of lime sour cream on corn tortillas. It was really good once we topped out tacos with salsa. The salsa bar must of had about 12 different salsas. Guacamole was pretty spicy, more spicy than most of the salsas on the bar. The beans were amazing! Who would say that about beans, but yes I did. 

Over all we loved this spot. Not sure if they have happy hour or a taco Tuesday special. The waitress did not mention any specials. I'll sure to be back."}
{"text":"Ambience: A
Cleanliness: A
Customer Service: B
Food: B+ 

Price 
-It is fairly inexpensive. Compared to other places I've been to in the area I think its in that cheap to moderate range. 

Atmosphere
-It looks like a hole in the wall when you walk in and its kinda of a turn off, but when you go to the large dinning area its really nice so the moral of the story is don't judge a book by its cover (or its entry way in this case I guess) 

Customer Service 
You order and pay at the counter as if it were a fast food place, but if you are staying they give a number and someone brings the food to you. It's fine, but I think because they have the huge dinning room, they should just take it the extra step and offer full service. I think it would just add a little extra something to the experience. 

Food 
So I spent an entire week in Arizona eating nothing but tacos, burritos and enchiladas and I've had all three at this restaurant (we visited twice) and I'd say its food falls right in the middle. It is not the best Mexican food I've had locally, but it is fairly close to the top. If their meat had just a little bit more flavor it would probably be one of my favorites. Their drinks however are AMAZING! 

Overall
I think this is a solid lunch or dinner place. Good food, good price, I just wish it was a little bit more upscale by adding wait service."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to this location (went to the Glendale one twice) and they are both 5/5! Haven't had anything bad from either location. Street tacos were great (chicken was super tender and could be cut with a fork) and the mole had the right combination of smoky and chocolately taste. Salsa bar is also one of the best I've ever seen - my personal favorite is the pecan salsa. The cilantro salsa is a close second, which is funny because I normally HATE the taste of fresh cilantro. I've also ordered the El Gaucho queso, which is basically like a big Mexican calzone. Steak was prepared well and tender and the outside shell was perfectly crisp on the outside. 

As good as the food is, I have to say the horchata was my favorite item. It's a little different from your normal horchata as it contains walnuts, strawberries, and a healthy dollop of cinnamon on top. It seemed strange at first, but it works!! 

Prices were very reasonable too (4 street tacos, steak queso, and a horchata all for $24). The restaurant is small and unassuming, and is the kind of place you would easily miss if you weren't looking for it. Also, it's pretty small and cramped in there, but when the food and drinks are this good, who's noticing that? Sure, this place may not be the most authentic Mexican restaurant (mostly gringoes up in here) but it is still one of my favorite restaurants in the area since moving to Arizona two months ago!"}
{"text":"We came here randomly on our house hunting trip to Phoenix and have been going back ever since. Their food is excellent as is their salsa bar. We alway take out of town guests and it remains our go to for great, affordable, and authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. Their new menu keeps all of their original greats and added new ones. From Mole to beer battered avocado you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican Food I've had in AZ! Not your typical greasy, heavy Mexican food. Everything is so fresh and delicious. They have a huge salsa bar with a variety of salsas. Their margaritas are delightful. I highly recommend if you're craving something a little south of the border."}
{"text":"Great find! This place is a little whole in the wall and not the \"cleanest\" environment....but the food was great! Best margarita I have ever had...and that was only the house margarita. Can't wait to come back for happy hour when they are only $3.00. I had the shrimp and carne asada tacos while my husband had the burrito with carne asada, bell peppers, avocado. Everything was delish! The salsa bar was great! So many different choices and all were excellent.
The table behind us had the guacamole and quesadilla...both looked yummy..they were very loud about how great it all tasted too! :)

I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The best tacos EVER!!! They taste like Mexico I love it... The place is super small but the wait is worth the while"}
{"text":"Intimidating menu but great great tacos, so you can't go wrong with the street taco section if not sure where to start. Huge variety of salsas to try, making eat bite unique and keeps you coming back forever to try new combinations. 

Pricing is good on the street tacos, the specialty tacos are a bit of a stretch, but still a better deal than touristy \"gourmet cantina\" places.  Order at the counter and they bring it out to you pretty quickly, very small dining room for how many people come here. Parking is pretty nonexistent. But the food and friendly ordering makes it all worth it!"}
{"text":"I'll echo the sentiments of other reviewers that the service here is horrendous; staff is completely rude and aloof. 
Phoenix has tons of great mexican joints, no need to frequent this one. Overlook the hype and take your business to a resturaunt that actually appreciates your business."}
{"text":"Another hidden treasure in the valley of the sun. I went there for lunch and it was packed,  food was great as always."}
{"text":"One of my favorite little local restaurants! The street tacos are amazing.  I love the cultural variety they bring from south of the border.  The art and atmosphere are hip but not pretentious.  And the salsa bar is stocked with 20 different unique flavors. Watch out! Some of them are very spicy! Small inside so there was a wait on Friday night, but the service was fast and friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"You can tell they take care in preparing the food here. The meats are tender and the sauces and spices are to die for!"}
{"text":"La Santisima is my go-to for sit down Mexican. I love their tacos, and they have an incredible salsa bar with ~20 options. The horchata is a must try. My family has to eat here every time they visit!"}
{"text":"The salsa bar was fun and interesting. Maybe not quite as tasty as I had hoped. But it was amusing to try so many different styles of salsa.

When people say get the horchatta, they mean it. Get that thing. Lots of flavor. Not too sweet. Overall very much worth the price.

The tacos were wonderful and this was the first time I had mole that I really liked it. So much deep flavor. Give this place a chance. It is not like the stereotypical heavy, greesy food that we've come to expect. But the flavors are amazing."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and different! Has vegan and vegetarian choices.  Loved the many different salsas from the salsa bar. Laid back atmosphere.  Friendly staff. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM!!! This place is amazing. The focus is fresh delicious food. Everything tastes like it was made from scratch that day. Everything we've eaten had a distinct flavor so you can really get a feel for lots of different tastes. Whatever kind of \"Mexican\" you are in the mood for; this place will deliver. Nothing here ever feels like it was rushed to be cooked faster.

I have been here twice and the second time was even better than the first.

The first time we had 2 Cochinita pibil (pork) tacos, a Dogfish Shark taco and a Carne Asada taco. All of them were amazing with each having their own unique seasonings, complimentary accoutrement (pickled red onion for the pork, cabbage and creamy salsa for the shark etc.).

The second time we got a 'Dogfish Shark' taco, a chicken mole taco and a chicken burrito. The chicken mole was outstanding. My mouth is watering remembering it. It was a perfect earthy balance of the chili and the chocolate dancing on my tongue. The chicken burrito was also amazing in its simplicity. The refried beans are smoky and smooth in an indescribable way. The chicken was slow cooked and complimented the beans well. 

The horchata was very good- and not gritty or powdery or too sweet like many places. My only complaint (because nothing's perfect right?) is I would have liked more ice. Yeah- that's all I could come up with.

The variety of salsas makes it fun. The first time we went they didn't have the strawberry salsa we had read so much about, so of course we had to come back! We got the strawberry salsa and there was also the peanut salsa which I preferred to the strawberry one. Again the variety of tastes in the salsa is fantastic. The flavor combinations are unique and widely varied from sweet, to savory to spicy.

I work around the corner so will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This place MUST have paid for their reviews. . I'm sure I'll eventually see this review being removed. 
Service here is beyond horrible. It took a table next to us 10 minutes before being greeted. Keep in mind, there's only about 10 tables in the whole place.. All in one small room. 
The food here is bland. Gross. The steak taco and burro we ordered were both full of gristle. Also got a specialty burro with shrimp. Blah. All bland with no flavor.
For having menu prices on the higher end of the spectrum, you would expect a better location. Scary!!! 

The only deserving star for this place is their salsa's. They do a good job with the salsa, I must admit.  But I don't see myself going somewhere JuSt for the complimentary salsa.

Do yourself a favor and go a couple blocks over to EL Nopalito's"}
{"text":"The Margaritas were delicious!!..but, I don't see myself coming back. We were a big party when we arrived but there were tables and chairs available to combine however, we still had to wait to be seated and there were no other new guests coming in at the time. Also, the wait to receive our food was WAAY to long. 

The food was overall pretty good but I didn't find it as \"the best I've had\" especially not for their prices."}
{"text":"The Mayan Cochinita Pibil tacos are AMAZING. These tacos have really impressed me. The horchata is also a great treat. They add strawberry, melon and nuts. I'm not vegetarian but i try not to eat so much meat and their veggie tacos are sooo good. Cheese, peppers, onions and mushrooms. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. I took away 1 star because sometimes the service is very slow, although i will say the last time i went they seemed to be working on it."}
{"text":"Decided to take my dad on a lunch date to La Santisima. We were both more than impressed with the taste and presentation of the food. I purchased a two taco plate and was stuffed like a turkey on Thanksgiving, well worth it! The salsa bar was amazing, so many options, you can't try them all in one sitting. This definitely means I'm going back for more!"}
{"text":"Listen. The only thing you need to know is this: the hype is real. The positive rave reviews are real. Just come here. It is out of this world."}
{"text":"I love this place due to the large, I mean really large selection of salsas!  There are over 10 different salsas that are so unique and fresh.  My favorite things to eat is their Chicken Chipotle and Carne Asada tacos with a side of beans (that comes with cheese on top).  These tacos are also on happy hour for $2!  They also have a really good Horchata that is super unique and a little expensive, but it has real nuts and fruit in it that makes it special.  I love bringing friends from out of state here!

Although this place is not in a very safe-looking area, when you walk in it looks very clean and comfortable.  The decor inside is very unique and artistic.  Even the bathroom alone has unique paintings.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Damn this place is GOOD. A family friend discovered it right after it opened, and I am always down to go there.

Parking is a SOB, look for street parking because the lot in front of the place is always packed. 

Lunch time is out of control packed and the dining area is TINY so come at odd times for your best bet and shortest wait. Love the decor tho. Old school, giant wooden tables/chairs, giant local art. 

20 salsas to choose from, ranging from pica de gallo to pistachio, you'll always find new ones to try. Tacos are quite good. Maybe a little pricey, but it's worth it. I always try something different because it's guaranteed to be tasty."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  Salsa bar is amazing!!   Their quesadillas are incredible.   Chicken tinga unbelievable.  
I always have incredible service at La Santisima.  The restaurant is small, so get there early or you will wait for a table."}
{"text":"Stop reading and just freaking go there NOW!

It's the best place for street tacos... by FAR!  From traditional carne asada, pollo asada, carnitas, to exotics like fish and shark tacos... it's FANTASTIC! The price is fair and their menu is pretty large.

The place is definitely not Scottsdale. It's a small place and looks kinda dirty.  They have the whole \"Day of the Dead\" theme going on.  It's an odd looking place but trust me, these are the kind of places where you will find the most authentic food.

They also have a small bar to serve up some nice cocktails and beers.

Their chips are very good and they have a salsa bar with over 14 different salsas. I'm glad my friend recommended this place to me.  I look forward to visiting often.  It's sure is a LOT closer than driving to Mexicali for the same tacos! :)

Advise:  The seating is limited, so if you arrive at the traditional week day noon lunch rush, expect to wait for a table.  It's first come first serve.  I usually visit around 1:30pm or on the weekends."}
{"text":"My mouth salivates when I drive by. This place is soooo yummy. Their un-traditional quesadillas are amazing!"}
{"text":"No matter what you get, you're going to love it. Everything is so flavorful and with all the salsa choices, every bite can be different."}
{"text":"I hate it when I don't love a place that everyone else loves, but after seeing the reviews and ratings for La Santisima, I expected a lot. I wish my expectations had been met!

This is definitely hard to find, but we were able to park in one of the few spots up front. The parking lot is small, and you might have to park a few blocks away in the nearby neighborhood. If you have a big car, you should probably skip looking for a spot right in front and just park in the neighborhood to save yourself some grief.

The restaurant is small and cramped. Seating is very close, and even during early times, there is a wait. If you don't mind high impact, you'll probably be fine with La Santisima. Service is very slow - there's only a couple people working in the restaurant serving as host/hostess, server, and from what I could tell, bartender. I have to give credit because obviously the two servers were running around like crazy, busting their butts and doing the best they could, but I really think it would be good to hire another person so that you don't have to wait to be seated, wait to receive a menu, wait to receive water, wait to order a drink, wait to order food, wait to receive food, etc. In short - things might be sped up (quite a bit?) if another person worked there.

Salsa bar is nice, but I think bigger cups should be available in addition to the small ones because it's annoying to get up 93874 times for refills. I did love the peanut salsa - spicy and delish. House margaritas are nice, and strong! Quesadillas are delicious and wonderful as an appetizer. I would get them again as a meal.

Tacos... hm. El gaucho tacos had very chewy meat, with little seasoning... bland. Pork tacos are pretty good, but but not wow. Just... hm. Much to be desired. Beans are too salty, but the rice is very good. I don't know. I just expected more flavor and better quality meat.

In sum! Not bad, just OK."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!!!! 

I moved to PHX about 6 months ago. Obviously, I expected to find lots of great Mexican places. So, on a Friday afternoon I had some extra time and a strong craving for Mexican. When I found out Guy from DDD had paid this place a visit, I had to give it a whirl.

First - it is TINY! I actually drove right past it the first time. The service was top notch with my waitress guiding me thru the menu. Unfortunately, at the time I am *starving* so looking at all the possibilities and making a decision is practically impossible.

About that time, the waitress walks past me with a quesadilla... It was love at first sight!!!!! And again at first bite!!! I went with the pork shoulder with pineapple. The thing about these quesadillas - think a Mexican version of a calzone! Which is basically pure magic. I can usually put down some serious food - I could barely finish 1/2 of the quesadilla. 

Based upon the reviews, I had to order the Horcheta. WOW! They were not exaggerating about the size. It was a steal for $4. 

My only regret was that I only had room for the Horcheta for desert. I saw another table with what i assumed was tres leeche cake - it looked delicious!!!! Next time perhaps.

This is my current place to beat for Mexican. 1000X's better than The Mission... Especially considering dinner for 4 at The Mission was $100+.... Here it would have been maybe $50."}
{"text":"i got 3 street tacos. 2 of them were just meh but one of them (i think the pork one) was aaahhhh may shingggg. my boyfriend loved what he ordered as well. the salsa bar is great but it was all too spicy for me hahaha. plus the fact that the prices are so low makes this spot a must-try."}
{"text":"Best Mexican I have ever had anywhere in the US.  This place is amazing!!! The wait is worth it.  Small only about 10-15 tables."}
{"text":"With 234 reviews (and counting) there's no need for me to go into great detail. I'll just add to the weighted score. This place lives up to the hype, so get at it!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food with flavor! The mango margarita on the rocks was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Maintain low expectations for service, wait times, and general common sense. But damn is the food ever worth such trauma."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and unique tacos. I would highly recommend this place. Great salsa bar, secluded atmosphere. I take friends here from out of town to give them a real taste of Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever had ! I recommend the mole poblano tacos their Michelada and horchata I have never had tacos as good as these and their salsa bar is the best the almond salsa was my favorite the service was great it's a little small restaurant but worth waiting"}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is amazing!
Horchata rocks
Service during lunch time on 12/19/2017 by one server was exceptional
Salsa bar was exciting and fun to try all the different ones.
Food was so good! I was nervous about the white rice they brought out. But it had more flavor than most Spanish style rice I have had.
You have to try it..Just don't go during my lunch time so I can find my own table. Giggle*"}
{"text":"Once again, Yelp did not disappoint.  My brother ~ who lived in San Antonio ~ and is addicted to good Mexican Food came to visit.  With the pressure of finding a great place, I turned to Yelp.  Excellent selection!!! So many yummy salsas and the Tacos were quite good.  Not as amazing as Barrio Queen but definitely yummy.  The Margaritas were beyond divine tho ...as was the fried Quesadilla and I am not s fan of rice and beans, but these were exceptional."}
{"text":"This place is straight up 5 Star, great food, great staff and great experience. It's simply a 10!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Well... couldn't help it... gotta bump this up to a perfect five stars after our last visit. Our first visit we tried every taco on the menu... this time we tried a quesadilla, an Oaxacan Black Mole Burro, and for good measure a regular old bean burrito because we wanted to try their beans. On top of that I just had to get another 'Dogfish Shark' taco because it was my favorite, and instead of the Horchata we tried their Jamaica drink...mmm. 

The quesadilla was very different, made with a really thick corn tortilla with sour cream drizzled all over it... damn good. Perfect to tear pieces off of and dip in the different salsas. The two burros we tried were equally tasty... and just like last time the chips were spot on. What's not to love about this place? It's just one of those 'easy to fall in love with' little holes in the wall. 

I think I'd give just about anything for them to start selling their salsa's to-go... especially after our last visit and finally being able to try the much talked about strawberry salsa; it really is as good as everyone says it is... heaven in a sauce basically. Whoever the mad scientist is behind these salsas really deserves a pat on the back, because I'm hooked. 

From what I've been hearing this place is slowly starting to get busier and busier... it puts a smile on my face to see good food and good businesses succeed based on word of mouth. In my ideal world there'd be a La Condessa on every other corner, instead of a Taco Bell... eh, baby steps I guess. 5/5."}
{"text":"We take all our visiting friends and family to this taco mecca whenever we can. 
You will not be disappointed if you go. 
The taco's are ingenious and you will leave contended and happy. 
The salsa bar is phenomenal.... they have good beer and their taco are awesome. 
If you looking for great food, you have found it."}
{"text":"Wow this place deserves the great reviews, I'm from out of town and was visiting this week. La Condesa is close to the airport so allow yourself an extra hour and go try it. 

I had the shark taco and the cochonita pork taco. Excellent! The pork had a strong tangy flavor to it, the pickled onions on top kind of had a strange taste. The shark was beer battered and very tender crispy on the outside. Great tastes on both. 

The salsa bar is impressive with done really unique styles of salsa, some even have pecan flavor in them! What?

I also had a Horchata which is a sweet rice milk, you can get it plain or with pecans and fruit, impressive! But if you get the one with the pecans in it don't try to drink it with a straw!

I wish we had a place as great as this where I live, I'd eat there weekly. Lots of creative items."}
{"text":"Oh my. This place is delicious. The food was amazing and fresh. Legit mexican food. Food came fast and the quesadilla/queso thing will now be included on my last meal menu. The whole ordering/getting a table was confusing but we just followed the herd. Would def rec'd going off peak hours and don't come with more than 4 people."}
{"text":"Service here is absolutely awful! Expect to sit and wait 20 to 30 minutes just to order your drink. Today we waited for 30 minutes to be greeted only to be told that their register was down and they were no longer taking orders for the day. Had they told us that when we arrived, that would have made things much easier. Will not return again"}
{"text":"Salsa Bar. Salsa Bar. Salsa Bar. I cannot say enough yum things about this hip little spot. The tacos were divine, the meats and spices were absolutely perfect. Loved the service here, and did I mention the salsa bar?? So many choices and every one a winner. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious margaritas, excellent salsa bar, local business.....the trifecta of restaurants.  I like that it is small inside and eclectic.  The guacamole is amazing as are the white fish tacos.  Really, you can't go wrong.  Close your eyes and point to a menu item....it will be awesome whatever comes out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"What can I say besides their street tacos are insanely good. I love the taco here. My wife and I found this place by mistake.ever since finding it we go their 2 to 3 times a month. I would highly recommend it to everyone. If you love street tacos check this place out!!!! parking some times is not that great but its down town Glendale so that is just area. they also have awesome Salsa Bar."}
{"text":"It was really good! My boyfriend and I shared the quesadilla which was the bomb. I had the chicken asado tacos he had the special santisima taco and the carne  asada street tacos. Everything was really good! Its a little cramped and small for our liking but totally worth  it. Oh and the Mexican salsa was the best!!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal.

If you are looking for a small hole in the wall joint that serves clean, delicious, authentic tacos, this is where you want to go. It costs $5 for two a la carte large tacos served on fresh corn tortillas that are filling.

There are a variety of choices, you cannot go wrong. The meats are all prepared with strong spices, and cooked appropriately without being dry. The seafood is well seasoned, and kept moist after preparation and frying. Best of all, there is a salsa bar with over 10 different types of fresh salsas to accompany your dishes.

My only gripe is that there aren't additional \"authentic\" cuts of meat like lingua or tripe. But still, everything done here is done exceptionally well."}
{"text":"Was looking for vegetarian options and was pleasantly surprised with what I got!  

Salsa bar had a lot of choices, the tomatillos green salsa was so good. 

Only thing that would change this score to a 5 star is if the waitress paid a little more attention, she constantly mixed up mine and my friends orders. And if they had nicer menus, the ones provided were falling apart."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall with delicious, authentic Mexican. Made me a fan of horchata. Best I've ever had. From their salsa bar to their tacos and burros, everything is rich and amazing. I usually have to wait for 30-40 min for my food, due to how busy it always is, but well worth the wait. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delish. Cool Salsa bar. Packed."}
{"text":"Such a cute, unique place. All of the tacos are amazing (pulled pork, carne asada, grilled shrimp), carne asada burro is also very different & delicious!!! 

Looks shady from the outside, but that's what makes it even better, & a great find."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere, excellent variety of salsas, amazing horchata and the tacos are fabulous! We came from south Gilbert for no other reason than to come here. It's definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican food I had in my life!! I don't even want to take the time to write all the bad things, but it was disgusting!!
(The \"Arracher steak\" really bad quality, taste like horse or dog meat and I'm not jocking)."}
{"text":"Love the salsa bar and how many vegetarian options there are."}
{"text":"This is hard to write because every other time I have been here I have been very impressed.  Unfortunately it only takes one bad visit to ruin it for me entirely.  

The menu finally changed, I am not sure at what point but everything on the menu has gone up in price.  I ordered a quesa which I was used to at a cheaper price.  I get it, things get more expensive as time goes on to a degree.

The service was astoundingly poor and this one hurt us the most.  The waitress barely paid any attention to us and we were the only ones who were inside eating.  There was a large group of employees who were all conversing and we were definitely left on the back burner when it came to attention.  I asked for silverware and she just pointed to the plastic knives and forks over by the salsa bar.  Five minutes later I witnessed the waitress placing the rolled silverware on all of the tables...except ours.  We also were never given a water refill or even checked up on.  We sat for about 10 minutes waiting for our check until I finally lost my patience and had to ask for it along with a to go container.

The last element that I really did not enjoy is the fact that the food is served on straw trays with a cheap wax paper on top.  When you are paying $14 for a menu item and eating with plastic knives and forks on a thin piece of paper...it just does not feel right.  It's too cheap for what you pay for.  

Overall the food really is very good but has become much more expensive and when you are eating with a plastic knife and fork on a bogus plate along with a staff who could care less, I just can't justify giving my business there anymore which really is unfortunate.  This is a hard one to let go!  But the good news is that there are plenty of other spots around here in Phoenix that want your business and will appreciate it so go forth and discover them !"}
{"text":"Stunning variety of fresh salsas that cover the spectrum from salsa fresco to a cabbage salsa (the night that we were there) and it is my understanding that the salsas are created daily and vary from day to day.

While the salsa selection is incredible, I was encouraged to order an Aztec Tinga Taco. While I enjoy slathering salsa on virtually any Mexican food offering, I found that the Aztec Tinga Taco was so perfectly seasoned that it require no additional seasoning. Perfect.

Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Very hip , cool art everywhere and their food is very fresh with some unique recipes& options.Cool Vegetarian \"street tacos\" too . The mole tacos were a real standout among the many types we sampled. We each picked 3 different tacos so we sampled 6 kinds  of taco. Despite enjoying the tacos and beer.....We really felt both the tacos (around$5 each)and micheladas (over$10)were so much more expensive than we usually pay for such \"treats\" it was hard to feel it was \"worth it\" overall ."}
{"text":"After two consecutive, relishing visits, I have declared La Condesa as my numero uno taco joint in the valley of the \"Bertos\". The obscure and hoody street it resides on has always kept me hesistating until one day! Before I immersed myself into the unknown, I had to do some Yelp investigation.  I wanted to know which taco(s) in particular people were raving about.  Coincidintally, the ones people tipped about were the ones I also adored! 

I kept seeing Yelpers talk about them dogfish shark tacos, so I knew I had to order those first along with the can't-go-wrong carne asada! First thing that happens upon entering the cool, wooden door, you place your order at the counter and find an open seat once a number is assigned to you. 

Being that they specialize in tacos, I focused on just that (for now)! They do have burritos and other things but its all about the tacos!  Here are your options:

1 Taco: $2.99, will not fill you up, but it is still a decent size.

2 Taco Plate: $6.99, you get 2 tacos of the same core ingredient (ie. Carne Asada, Fish) plus 2 sides (refried beans and rice)

2 Mix Taco Plate: $8.29, you get to choose any 2 tacos from the menu, plus the sides I mentioned.

Beverage is additional.

What I have tried thus far:

1. Dogfish Shark Taco:  Killer! What makes these so awesome is in the beer batter!  They are super crispy, hot and the fish itself is still soft and moist!  

2. Shrimp: Again, Killer! Comes out very similar to the shark tacos, except it is shrimp!

3. Carne Asasada: Holy cannoli folks! Some might argue that America's Taco Shop are better but I would say the quality and taste is near even!  Condesa might edge them with its overall composition and various salsas!  It had that mesquitte, charred off the grill kind of taste and cut perfectly to fit into a taco!

4. Cochinita Pibil (Pork): The first three tacos I mentioned were pretty darn good! But this one stood out quite well on its own.  It was savory and packed with excellent flavors!  As the menu stated, it was slow-cooked, fork tender!

The 2 sides-

Refried Beans: Excellent! 
Rice: Excellent! perfectly cooked!

The cool part about dining here is enjoying their Salsa Bar! If I recall correctly , there were about 10 different salsas to choose from!  The tricky part is pairing it with the taco you just ordered! Experiment, I say! As part of every order they bring you a basket of warm, house chips!

From the outside, you would never assume that such a great taco place existed, but once you step inside you know something good is about to happen!  Every wall has some sort of hip and contemporary Mexican art, from flowers to people.  The overall decor is very tasteful and upbeat!

Staff members are very friendly and courteous!

I took my office colleagues out during my second visit and they have nothing but positive responses and is begging to come back for more!

Whether you are a connoiseur of Mexican cuisine, tacos or just love eating good food, I highly advise you stop by!  For the overall great taste and value, its hard to beat this cool taco spot that will please all your senses!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I miss the days when I used to live within walking distance and could really relish my time with the house margaritas. 

I love their decoration and small dining rooms. It's cozy. Their salsa bar is just amazing, the mexicana salsa is my favorite, but they will have something for everyone. 

You can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Dig in and grab a margarita!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Pleasantly surprised with how good and varied the salsa bar is.  Wish I could afford to eat there more often, but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Two words : The Best!  As I am new to the valley, o have been exploring places to eat. Came across this place and I'll be sure to turn into a regular. The food was different than I'm  used to ( authentic mexican ).  But oh my..... so delish!  I ordered a shark taco and the Guacho burro.  The salsas were all superb! The horchata was good,  I think I'd still like to see the original horchata on the menu though.  

Overall, fantastic place, and Stacy the server was on point!"}
{"text":"Awesome Food.

Best salsa Bar.

They need a bigger restaurant to service more customers."}
{"text":"Authentic, great flavors, and amazing service. DDD TV segment inspired our first visit. Had mole burrito which did not disappoint. Wife had a specialty drink - much too sweet. Fresh salsa bar fresh with a variety of unique options. Will return for sure however not a Saturday evening. - exceptionally loud."}
{"text":"This place is just ok.
Tables and seats are very close to each other, kind of hard to get through to get to the salsa bar. 

We ordered a lonche and a quesadilla and they were ok. Not bad, but not super good either. 

We also ordered a santísimo remedio, a drink with grapefruit, lime, tequila and soda. Well, let's just say I should've just ordered a cup of ice with just a bit of tequila. My husband ordered a non alcoholic one and he got a lot more drink than I did. 

Overall, the place is ok. It didn't leave us wanting more. It has fame because Guy from drivers and dine-ins visited. That's what caught our attention."}
{"text":"Love the strawberry salsa here.  My only complaint is that they do not take Amex!  4th star is only because they didn't accept my Amex. The salsa bar and taco selection are incredible ."}
{"text":"great food, fun environment and of course salsa bar.  as authentic as it gets and a great taco stop for taco fans."}
{"text":"Love the Salsa Bar. The Santisma Veggie Taco is Da Bomb. I did not care too much for the Cactus Veggie Taco but do not hold that against them. The street tacos and Mole are both wonderful too. Great food, divey interior. Great find says the gal who is not the biggest lover of Mexican food. I would go here again. Service was a bit slow though but nice ladies."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Visited restaurant with friends last Sat night around 6:30 pm. Slow service, messy salsa bar, small broken bits of tortilla chips in basket, weak margaritas and way smaller tacos than on our other visits. Hardly any fish on taco, beef taco was just that - beef on a small corn tortilla - nosauce, no garnish. New owners, perhaps?
Will try other location and compare!"}
{"text":"I like their tacos and their salsa bar.
I like the people who work here.

I do not like the neighborhood, to be perfectly honest.
I also don't like eating with a bunch of flies in a too warm restaurant.

Maybe I just came on an off day, but eating at La Condesa was just not pleasant for me, regardless of the company I kept.  

The abundance of flies in the restaurant made it difficult for me to enjoy my meal to the fullest.

It also made it hard for me to concentrate on the otherwise stimulating conversation I was having.  I had to swat flies the entire time.  Maybe it is because they leave the front door wide open?  The flies can't resist such delicious food?

I'm no snob and the food really was good.  I just can't see myself going to La Condesa again in its current location.

UPDATE: Okay, maybe I AM a snob."}
{"text":"Nice small restaurant for street tacos. Had the carne asado tacos which are fresh and tasty.

The thing that stands out here is the salsa bar with the different varieties of salsa to choose from. Fresh and home made with a great opportunity to experiment and sample all kinds.

Very small place with old tables and dawn of the dead motif if that is your thing. Service is good but they dont have much to do with you. The parking is limited and may need to park along a side street.

You order at the counter and they bring the food to you. Simple and easy

Recommend to try their tacos if you want real tacos and something different"}
{"text":"So good. It was my first time and I didn't realize you get chips on your table and the have a very interesting salsa bar. I went for the mole, and I was not disappointed! So good. They have a good vegetarian selection too. I also tried their family recipe barbaquoa and their pork tacos. They were good too. But next time I'm just getting the mole tacos and chip. I should also mention their beans were really good too."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Shrimp mole taco and fish taco and cactus taco. All were great. So is salsa bar."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, portions were better then expected and the food was high quality. We had the Shrimp and Carne Asada Tacos w Rice and Beans. I cant wait to go back and try other plates. The horchata was also amazing, different then the normal but very good!"}
{"text":"AL PASTOR, ALL DAY. 
The biggest draw of this place is by far the salsa bar. Love all the green ones and the chipotle. Not the biggest fan of the peanut one, but to each their own! Eat the gaucho taco and absolutely the al pastor. The al pastor is a smaller street taco served in two corn tortillas but full on flavor. The meat is tender but with just the right amount of chew and the spices do a great job of cutting the richness of pork. Add a little jicama salsa for crunch and variation.
Chips are good, they're thin enough you can eat several without getting too full. I love the rice-it has corn in it? I'm a textural person and it definitely adds a little character to rice. 
I've seen people sipping on huge cups of horchata and that's definitely next on my list of things to try next time I'm back."}
{"text":"Visited here today for lunch for the first time. I was pretty excited about a salsa bar since I've never been to one and my last meal would definitely include chips and salsa. The rave reviews on Yelp won me over so I decided to recommend this place to a friend so we could meet up for lunch.

Luckily I snagged a spot right out front at 1pm but I'm not sure where the additional parking was? Upon entering, the place has some cute decor but it was a little startling to walk in and see that it's pretty small inside and it was busy. With no hostest stand, I immediately had that, 'deer in headlights look' about what to do and where to go but I was recognized when I walked in within a few seconds and luckily there was a table for two open. While I was recognized and that was a relief, I wasn't greeted per say but was just asked if there would only be one for lunch. I said I was waiting for a friend so luckily they sat me without her being there. The water came around and gave me small plastic Solo cup full for water and menus. I've never seen solo cups like this in a restaurant? Maybe it's for the lunch crowd? I noticed all the other tables had larger drinks, also in plastic cups, so maybe it was just for your drinks to go?

Anyway, my friend arrived a few minutes later and after we got caught up on our week and looked over the menu, I had to flag down our waiter to order. I attempted to order the grapefruit margarita that I had heard rave reviews about but the waiter didn't understand 'Grapefruit Margarita' and offered some fruity one with melon and something else. When I confirmed that it didn't have grapefruit and he offered another one, again without grapefruit, I opted just to forget it and drink the water. I figured I would fill up on chips and salsa so I went with two al la cart tacos. My friend ordered a mahi mahi bowl. I was pretty impressed with their chips, not overly thick like some places and pretty light and the the 6-7 salsas we tried were mostly good. I wasn't aware there was a need for peanut salsa? It was definitely different but not something I needed to try twice. My favorites were the creamy white one (can't remember the name) and the strawberry salsa one. You go help yourself to the salsa bar once they bring the chips but it looked like you had to pay extra for an extra bowl of chips since they were on their special of the day board for $2. Also, the salsa bar had small dipping cups to eat the salsa. They're about the size of the to-go dressing cups you get in other restaurants but not quite as deep. Again, they were plastic so it kinda took away from the overall feel of the meal. I'm all for convenience and I know this probably cuts down on the customers filling up larger containers and wasting salsa...and doing dishes...but I would think there has to be a more environmentally and more aesthetic way to do this? Granted, this is no fancy Mexican place but they seemed to put effort in the decor so maybe that's where they spent all their money on rather than real dishes? It definitely did discourage me from going back for seconds though so maybe that was their goal?

Our food came and both my tacos were really good. The presentation was nice, no plastic there! The tortillas were fresh and all ingredients seemed quality. My friend said her dish was really good and she got a really big portion. 

We enjoyed our meal but our waiter never returned. A young kid, maybe 8 or 10, came over and asked to take our plates and he asked if there was anything else we needed. I requested the bill thinking he would tell our waiter that we were ready for the check. I'm guessing this is a family owned place so I understand everyone pitching in but the kid then delivered our check and then took our credit cards to pay for the bill! Our waiter was standing back at the register, almost watching over him though, but I still wasn't overly eager about handing over my card to such a young kid. He was at least faster than our waiter though so I guess it was okay.

I really don't mean to harp on this place because the food was good. Just a few more things done differently and I could see this being a go-to spot for me. For now, it doesn't top my list of places I have to come back to soon."}
{"text":"Really awesome tacos here. I ordered the black mole and the conchinita pibil tacos. One of each and a steak queso. I didn't expect everything to be so big so I really over did myself. The queso I figured was like a quesadilla but it really isn't anything like that. Closest description is a calzone sized gordita. And not the taco bell version. The cheese was gooey and the undercooked parts of the masa were delicious. It was awesome. I broke out the plastic utensils and went to town. Daunting none the less. But I managed to put down half of it before the coma kicked in 

The mole taco was delicious. The chicken was sliced and covered in red onion. The sauce was spicy and not sweet at all. And the whole thing melted in my mouth. The corn taco shells are soft and made to order. The conchinita pibil taco was full of flavor and dripped juices all over the basket. Delicious. 

The horchata is unbelievable. Full of fruit and pecans as well as cinnimon and nutmeg.

the salsa bar is epic. there was at least 12 different salsas to try. the cilantro was really good. and i normally hate raw cilantro because i burp it. but this was excellent and really brought out the flavor of my food. also the strawberry salsa was hot with a hint of sweet and freshness. and the salsa peanut was very tasty. very. very.

I'm buying a bike just to ride here.  A lowerider bike with two 20's in a trailer. So I can rock all the way there.

for now condesa....you are in my top 10."}
{"text":"Well the horchata was ok.

I guess the first issue.. ordered street tacos a la carte that were supposed to be 1.95 but somehow they decided the bring out the plate w/ rice and beans because this was supposed to save money.. well it didn't.. I didn't ask them too.. but hey.. thanks i guess lol.

Stay away from the carne asada tacos. The meat is poor quality.. too much fat and it makes for a greasy taco..this in my opinion is a pretty bad asada taco. The mountain of cabbage doesn't help it's overall lacking in flavor either. Pile on the salsa, those are really good. Also it's reheated which is standard practice i guess but some of these pieces were pretty black.. living in a mexican household you know this happens when you reheat the meat a few times. I could not tell the difference between the street taco and the more expensive arrachera taco. Meat quality = same.

Burro was solid. Salsa's great.. no chip refills. All in all for 70 bucks.. not worth it. That's 12 tacos rice and beans, 1 burrito, and 5 drinks.. this at Los Taquitos would cost me $40ish. However those tacos are ridiculous good unlike here.  Don't get what the fuzz is all about."}
{"text":"I liked this place but I dont feel like it's as amazing as yelp says it is. They do have a large salsa bar which is nice for people who like to try tons of different flavors. I found only a couple that I really enjoyed. The tacos were good, but not the absolute best I've ever had. Service was mediocre at best. I would eat here again if someone invited me. Decent food for sure. But the best I've ever had? No"}
