{"text":"I ordered the pong special and was surpised to see all my favorite goodies: plaintain, cassava, rice & peas (beans), tofu, okra, chickpeas, avacado, etc...  As mentioned do call first in case they run out of food or close early."}
{"text":"Hands down the best vegetarian food in all of Toronto. Over the top portions. Everything is so flavourful and blends perfectly. Thank you"}
{"text":"Vegetarian / vegan Caribbean food is not a combination you see often. We love the spices and flavours from the region, and were curious to try this place. We are not vegetarian, but try to eat meatless meals a few times a week. And we've had some great Caribbean food over the years (with meat), so expectations were high. I had a meal with jerk tofu (delicious) and chickpea curry (comes with rice and peas, a bit of salad, avocado and fried plantain) and hubby had a roti with the chickpea curry. We loved it! Everything was so yummy! Service was attentive and friendly. Prices are very reasonable and portions are good. We'll be back to V's for sure!"}
{"text":"Hidden yet a great spot to grab a delicious, fresh, healthy meal. Prices are good and owners are very helpful with selecting and trying something new."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Seven people feasted like royalty on 3 Pong specials, okra and bammie, roti, mandazi, and fresh-squeezed raspberry-cucumber juice. We had two vegans and one guy with a lot of food allergies, and everybody got tons to eat. My folks have vowed to return whenever they're in town--two very happy vegans! Thank you SO MUCH!"}
{"text":"First time eating here, and I had the best experience ever (for real)! I came in here with my boyfriend for lunch today (Saturday) after a very emotional morning and the vibe was extremely uplifting. We were immediately greeted by exuberant staff and since we mentioned it was our first time and we didn't know what to get, they offered us tasting plates. The portion size was perfect for my boyfriend and a little too much for me, but everything was satisfying and surprisingly comforting. The beverages were tasty as well! I left feeling extremely lucky to have found this place and even plan to come back next week."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Chill vibes, lovely staff, amazing carribean flavours and so cheap!
The atmosphere is really relaxed and seems like a local favourite. With decent serving sizes and a variety of curries, i would recommend to any vegan people looking to escape the price tag and pretentiousness of other vegan/vegetarian places. We left V's  full and happy and will deffinately be going again."}
{"text":"Jamaican vegan food you can feel good about eating! I'm so happy this restaurant is minutes down the road from me."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great customer service!! As someone who is vegetarian, and loves Caribbean food, this place is perfect!! I wish there were a location in Mississauga, but it's well worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Love the rice here, using basmati is genius, really great aroma and flavour, all the food here is pretty exceptional, i really enjoyed it and to b e honest, and for a vegan./veg resto, i was fully expecting not to like this food. But it turned out that i loved it for the most part. my only complaint would be their fried plantains, dry, hard and lacking any flavour. As much as i hate to waste food, they were thrown out, as they were pretty awful"}
{"text":"TL;DR Perfectly seasoned vegan comfort food: if I was asked to describe the restaurant's food in 5 words. It's homey, it's welcoming, it's unique, unexpectingly flavourful, and delicious! Please come here!!!

It was my first time here and because it seemed like a neighbourhood restaurant with the cashier cosily talking to his customers, I felt a little shy. But no worries, the cashier's smile is very welcoming and calming. 

*IMPORTANT NOTE* 
After deciding on the Special because I've seen from other reviewers that it's got a bit of everything, I noticed that the first thing he did after I paid was that he washed his hands!

!!! By the way, they have an open kitchen so they're very KEEN ON CLEANLINESS !!!

I was super impatient to try the food because I took it for takeout, I scuttled out and began eating in the car. Opening up the box of food the fragrance was mouthwatering!

Let's talk: The Chef's Special (Pong Special) 5/5
*PLEASE REFER TO PHOTOS*

It was like a treasure box! You got your rice and beans at the bottom, plantains, chickpeas, collard greens, sweet potato, squash, okra, tofu (two ways?), freshly cut avocado, and I think a potato cake (if not, then it might be a rice cake but I highly doubt)! The variety was a joy ride and it makes my mouth water while writing this review! How many more exclamation marks can I put?!?!?

*Also came with a water! 

The vegan food here makes me very happy and for the $15+TX I paid, well worth it. Even better than the sushi burrito food trend going on downtown which comes in at the same price! Not only is it super healthy and super delicious, it leaves your stomach super stuffed!

I'd have to come back and interview the team about how the food was prepared because I wouldn't want to describe their food incorrectly... and also give me an excuse to come back and eat more yummy food!

Thanks for having me and I'm looking forward to coming back next time!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food !!!  Better service !  This place is a diamond in the rough. Only downside is they accept cash only. 

Everything is made in house including the ginger beer and freshly squeezed juices. I had an everything plate (whatever it's called in Caribbean) and it was $16 plus tax. Extremely filling and satisfying. 

I highly recommend this place, even to non-vegetarians. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"We came here because of the yelp reviews and will return because of the food and friendly service. We got there at 11am on a Saturday and it wasn't too busy. Drew took the time to explain the menu to us. We decided on the roti with chickpeas and TVP (?) and bean and okra soup. The roti was flaky and the curried chickpeas and tofu inside was delicious. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was in the area so I decided to pay this place a visit. It's a vegan Caribbean restaurant. I recommend the chef special which is a bit of everything with a side of red beans & rice or quinoa. Good portions. Service is very friendly. Overall really delicious Caribbean food and worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Well on my day off, I decided to venture from Mississauga for a super early weekday brunch.  No idea why, but I guess I was bored and got there around 10:30 am.  You know, with this place looking like a lunch place, I thought they would only have a few things out by this time, but lo and behold, it was stocked to the max.  I walked in and the aroma hit me like \"wow, this smells soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good\".   The guy at the counter was amazingly friendly too.  There were a lot of choices and you can get a meal for $12, which included two entrees, some other things (I didn't pay attention) or you can get a Pong special for $16.  He showed me all the options and that didn't make my choice any easier because everything looked and smelt really good.  

So I just ended up getting the Pong's special.  It was a mix of lentil based food, soy based food with jerk and Caribbean flavours (I don't even know how to describe it). With regards to the taste, the food was definitely fresh and not greasy or overly salty (which is most Caribbean food IMO).  

Verdict: Friendly service, fresh food, vegan and vegetarian, and decent pricing. Will be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Cheerful, and fresh ital Caribbbean food. If it's your first time, get the Pong special so you can taste everything ($16). 

Then you'll know what you like for next time. This is a hit in my books, though a little pricy, the amount of food is good. 

Nice to have a vegan Caribbean spot in the Mount Dennis neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Still a good spot for vegan eats but be careful if you are doing take out lest you drive home only to discover they put wrong item in meal.

Suffice it to say I won't be returning anytime soon and haven't since a couple weeks after my first visit."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since they've opened. Love everything on their menu and just always need to get their platters or meals. 

Just the roti is never enough fo rme, not because the portions, trust me, they are big but cause I want all their flavors.

Love their bammi/callalou/curry tvp's/jerk maple tofu and sooo many different types of mashed root vegetables. 

Service is great and always welcoming!

Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing flavourful food one of my go-to restaurants. Staff is friendly and the service is great."}
{"text":"Their corn soup is great!
If your looking for a nice restaurant that is fair priced,fresh vegetarian food you need to come here. The roti is so fine ;)
Clean restaurant with great staff.
Seat yourself & have a nice time ;)"}
{"text":"Made a trip yesterday evening and made it just before the end of day. Got a delicious roti and soup. So yummy! Can't wait to come back (earlier in the day) and try more!"}
{"text":"Nice surprise it was vegan.
Staff looked very healthy, fit, so a good sign I should try vegan a bit more often....
Excellent chick pea, potato roti."}
{"text":"Hello!  My family and I were looking for some good eats close to where one of my daughters lives, and we stumbled upon V's. We were DELIGHTED!  There was something for everyone and everything was tasty and well priced.  The servers kept us well stocked with water, which we appreciated because it was a hot day. I highly recommend the Pong special - it's a sampler. You cannot go wrong. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came here to grab some vegan caribian food. This was the first time for me to do so. The server was very cool and friendly, lovely and energetic personality. The food was healthy and tasty. You can pick from two sides with salad and rice. The plate is big and filling but bit over price for 12 plus tax. Or you can get mix of everything for 15 bucks which I donot think is worth it as the plate is same size. The drinks were over priced for 5 bucks I would not suggest you order one."}
{"text":"First experience here was lovely, staff was friendly and offered free samples of their fresh juices along with edible flowers on my plate! Food was delicious with lots of options and we are everything off our plates. First time trying tofu jerk and their squash stew was the die for! Would definitely come back for another visit and try their baked sweet potato mash! 

Note: call first to see if they're open as they mentioned some days they may have sold out of food. 

Another note: watch out for parking, we got a ticket due to misleading parking signs, park across the street or side streets for free"}
{"text":"Came here to grab the pong special and although the food tasted good in the beginning, all the flavours kind of blended in together and I couldn't really tell what was what. Still, it was nice to have some vegan options in this neighbourhood. The pong special was pretty expensive though ($16?) and I wasn't full afterwards."}
{"text":"Amazing. What took me so long to visit? Tastiest veg*n food I've tasted in either Toronto or Hamilton."}
{"text":"While this place may have basic decor, there's NOTHING basic about their vegan food! SO flavourful, your finicky non-vegan friend will forget about missing meat. Ask the cook to create your meals or choose from the menu. They also have original
blends of fruit juices that not predictable as at other health restos or drink bars. A truly hidden gem that doesn't get noticed by typical local food media outlets but deserves positive reviews!"}
