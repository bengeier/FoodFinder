{"text":"Awesome Greek food. Friendly staff and service, well priced and nice sized portions. Try the Greek Fries they are fantastic."}
{"text":"The picado gyro is one of the best I've ever had. Can't wait to come back and see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Great food and service, and not terribly expensive.  My young kids love it too!"}
{"text":"Have had takeout from here a few times, it was really good.  I had the classic gyro and have had classic hummus.  Fresh food, very nice people working here.  It is now on our regular rotation of places to go."}
{"text":"Yesterday my friend and I both ordered Greek salads with chicken. Both were missing the cucumbers, olives, pepperocinis and green peppers. Decided to give it another try tonight with my husband. Ordered 2 gyro platters and falafel appetizer to go. Got home to find the pita and tzatziki missing for both platters. The falafel was dry and over cooked.  Will never return, it's worth the 10 extra minutes to drive to Pita Jungle.....simply no comparison. Sorry, this place is going to tank the same way the last two businesses that were in this location in the shopping center did."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff and delicious food. The owners make an effort to get to know the customers and offers us coupons and samples often. Best gyros and hummus I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Great gyro on a super fresh pita.  Just a good, simple lunch spot."}
{"text":"I was waiting for Pita Cafe to open as I am a fan of Gyros. I stopped in for lunch today and wasn't disappointed. It definitely has the feel of a small cafe. I was greeted by a very friendly hostess as soon as I walked in. Placing an order is very simple as is paying for your order.  My food arrived in a very timely manner. The Gyro was filled with very tasty lamb. All of the ingredients were very fresh. The pita itself was soft and flavorful. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I just went here after reading all of the great reviews in Yelp. Nothing is more of a turn off than the whole place reeking of cigarette smoke. Definitely a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Super friendly employees. They sell really yummy drinks and the food is just awesome!! The original gyro has amazing flavor. The meat is so delicious and the Greek salads are just phenomenal, maybe will just ask for more olives and pepperoncini on it next time"}
{"text":"One of our favorite \"take away\" spots...always good and a great healthy option. but I don't recommend using the On Line ordering feature, call the store direct.   Now to the food, excellent, very tasty and well priced.  We have had two different sandwiches, both great and the side of hummus with pita.  One of the best values around!  We esp love the Mediterranean Pita sandwich, loaded with grilled chicken, yummy."}
{"text":"Ok, Yelp...I've tried three times to post my review on Pita Café and it's not posting.  I guess I really like this place.  Food is awesome, fresh and healthy!!  The service is outstanding.  So glad, when my daughter wanted to go to the neighboring fast food sandwich place, I persuaded her to go to Pita Café.  Been many times since and the food and service has been excellently consistent."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! The Mediterranean Pita is SERIOUSLY heaven. Its is WAY too good and refreshing. I have nothing bad to say about them. And i admire the lady that works in the back kitchen and her AWESOME food!!!! Everyone there is nice and patient. I HIGHLY recommend this place. Wishvthey had one closer to the metro area. :("}
{"text":"Pita Cafe is great!  People are always friendly and the food is awesome.  I have gotten this for takeout 4-5 times now and it is very consistent and delicious."}
{"text":"5-star food. 5-star service. 5-star cleanliness.   We get the chicken shawarma platter and hummus. Delish!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, the food was okay, chicken kabbob were salty and broiled. The pita had 4 medium pieces of chicken and lots of  lettuce, and pickle with the yogurt sauce. I had hoped for better flavor and more meat (protein). Back to Sabas or Persian Room for lunch."}
{"text":"Had the platter with gyro meat.  Ample amount of meat.  Nice soft warm pita bread...some of the best I've had!  Greek side salad had a nice dressing.  Fantastic meal.  Very polite, friendly service.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I would give it 6 stars if I could! So good! Delicious lamb and chicken pitas.  Salad, grilled veggies. It was all delicious.  The staff was excellent as well.  Seems to be family run.  My only complaint is they don't have a location closer to our home! Casual atmosphere, but nice seating outside and very clear.  Also great value for the price.  Food was top quality."}
{"text":"We love Pita Cafe's service and delicious food. It's the best casual American Greek food we've found in the southwest. We love the shawarma, the falafel, the Greek salad, the pitas... the Greek fries are a fun treat, too. Fresh, yummy food!"}
{"text":"We miss the Tempe location but this is always our favorite restaurant.  Very family friendly, delicious food and the owner takes an interest in his customers."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great for a quick individual lunch or catering a marketing luncheon for 20! The food appeals to a broad spectrum of tastes. They have the food prepared on time and it is conveniently packaged."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place with great greek/Mediterranean food then pita cafe IS that place! One of the best gyros I have ever had and the best part about this restaurant is everything is fresh! Customer service is also a plus, very friendly and always welcoming!"}
{"text":"Paid these guys a visit recently, and overall the experience was not what I hoped for.  While the staff was very friendly, which is a big plus, the food and atmosphere were off. The place smelled like smoke, and more like fresh cigarette smoke than the kind of smoke generated while cooking. It only got worse during my visit, and made me want to leave.   The chicken on the gyro was overly watery.  Not juicy in a good way, but juicy like water logged from sitting in a broth or water mixture for way too long.   I've been to their other location at Frank Lloyd Wright and Scottsdale Road, and the chicken there has always been better, as they cook it on a flat top grill. Maybe the water-logged chicken briefly touched a grill, but it clearly was not cooked on it, as the texture would be more like what you expect from the grill, and not from a water bath.  I see the interior is being remodeled, and nothey've got some kind of faux stone tile look on the lower half of the walls, but it's more like a press 'n stick panel. More than anything, you see the seams and cracked edges. I appreciate the effort to give the place an authentic look and feel, but it ends up being more distracting, and cheapens the experience.   My suggestion is stick with the other location, and you'll be a happier camper."}
{"text":"Finally found an gyro place close to my home and it turns out to be fantastic and priced Very well.  The service was outstanding and the food delicious.  I have been back five times in three weeks!"}
{"text":"My wife found this place through Yelp reviews and we were certainly not disappointed. We check this place out on Friday night and although we came just before they closed they were more than accommodating. We ordered a wide variety of food including Gyros, Chicken Gyros, Hummus, and Fries. All of the items were delicious, I especially suggest the french fries with the Gyro toppings. The staff were all very friendly, definitely a mom-and-pop kind of place. We will certainly return, keep in mind if you are coming here to check in for 10% off your meal."}
{"text":"First time here and I was impressed! Good food and good service! I would give it a 5 star if the Steak Shawirma was made from a cone. But I was still impressed with the taste. Good Job Pita Cafe! I will def be back and bring clients in!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  Service was shockingly good for an order-at-the-counter place.  A lot of take out activity, but eating there works well too."}
{"text":"Great authentic pitas at a reasonable price. Although you order at the counter, the service was excellent, including refilling our self service drinks."}
{"text":"I would give more stars if I could. This is a little family owned gem that we visit weekly. We used them for some catering last night (New Years Eve). It was incredible. Our guests were raving about the food, asking where we bought it etc... We had the combo with greek salad, chicken shawarma, rice, hummus etc...  It comes with ample pitas as wells onion/tomato and tazikki sauce. Big portions, freshly prepared absolutely delicious. I can't say enough about Pita Cafe!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for something cheap and quick to eat in my neighborhood and found this place through  yelp. I was not disappointed.  The Greek salad was delicious (bonus: they use beets) and the pita (chicken) I had was really good.  My husband had a platter and it was massive! Realistically we probably could have shared it and still had left over. He has the shawarma with salad and rice.  We also had the baklava which was a bit dry but I might be a bit bias cause my grandmother makes it the best :)   Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Great concept and super value for North Scottsdale.  Take a look at the pic I uploaded.  All that food for eight bucks.  The salad was great with lots of Greek-y extras (feta, beets, etc.)  For a side salad there was no skimp here.  I got the Mediterranean Pita which is one tasty sandwich.   My kids got the Philly Pita which had chicken, grilled onions, grilled peppers and Swiss cheese.  They said it was as good as Pita Jungle.  This is exactly the type of affordable healthy food this neighborhood needed."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Fantastic hummus & gyros.  When we don't know what to eat for dinner, Pita Cafe is often suggested as a quick and tasty option.  Pretty fast service and good prices, too."}
{"text":"It's a good place to grab lunch.  Prices aren't too bad for what you get in this area but seating limited."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, very good food, high on the value scale. Decor is nothing to write home about. It is what it is, a small place with good food and friendly service at a reasonable price. A rare find in this area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to have a quick bite.... Very impressed! Nice atmosphere, the staff was friendly and the food was GREAT at a good price! I had the chicken cream chop pita...would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food is good, healthy and fresh. I usually opt for the chicken shawarma with a Greek salad.  The staff is always polite and attentive. One of my favorite quick, healthy and inexpensive spots."}
{"text":"We have a winner. My family loves Gyros and we love Pita Cafe. Nice clean seating area and really good food, friendly staff. As can be seen from my other reviews, there are some pretty poor excuses for Gyros in Phoenix, but, Pita Cafe is our new go-to place."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick little lunch! You order at a counter from a decent selection of Mediterranean/Greek good. I had the gyro (on special for $5) and it was good. Restaurant was clean and staff friendly. They have takeout and delivery advertised, although I didn't look into what delivery actually meant."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service! I had the Gyro and Greek Salad. I would have liked a bit more meat in the gyro, but other than that it was great!  A must try!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I drive past Pita Cafe every day, twice a day actually, and it never occurred to me to stop in for lunch or dinner.  I ordered take out for friends one night and got delayed picking up the order, significantly delayed.  When I arrived to pick up my order they informed me that they realized that I was taking a while to arrive, thus they had went through the trouble to keep my hot items hot and went in the back to pack up my to go order.    I was very surprised that anyone would realize that my food was getting cold while I was stuck in traffic, let alone go out of their way to keep our meals warm for me!  It was just the right amount of thoughtfulness and kindness on an otherwise stressful day.   Their hummus is truly one of the best in The Valley!  It's creamy and not too much garlic.  Their yellow rice and grilled veggies are very flavorful.  The Greek fries weren't bad, but not my favorite.  I would recommend them for office lunches and a great way to mix it up a little for dinner.  Affordabe alternative to typical takeout!"}
{"text":"Super affordable lunch spot with some of the best gyros I've ever had!!  Very friendly and accomodating staff handing out discounted cards for the next visit:). I'll definitely be back again. So far the beef shawarma and lamb gyro have been delicious and great portions. Greek salad was good too with a very bright dressing and real feta cheese. They also have a variety of local teas to make up for the lack of alcohol. Highly reccommended!"}
{"text":"I work about a mile from here and was very excited to find out when it opened last year. There was a need for it in the area and they filled it. Great food, good prices, and always happy to come back."}
{"text":"Good food nicely priced and a nice alternative to Pita Jungle. It's family owned too which is nice."}
{"text":"I love Pita Cafe! I crave it at least once a week. The staff is friendly and the food is always ready fast."}
{"text":"For the five buck chicken pita special, I was not expecting much, but instead got a solid and filling lunch. It was front loaded with juicy white meat strips and had the normal innards of lettuce, onions, tomatoes and a good version of tzitiki sauce. The combo is a bit of stretch for 4 bucks more, so go with the normal pita nd water and you got yourself a nice meal at under 6 bucks. Will be back to try other things as well, glad I wandered into this random shopping center."}
{"text":"Wow in a sea of chains and mediocre ethnic places in AZ this is a refreshing change.  Authentic and tasty- highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food is ok but nothing like real pita doner kebabs . Bread was dry and almost crusty , the meat was overlooked and dry and almost jerky , This cafe I assume is supposed to be a Greek or Med theme presentation of the food but very Americanised and no lemon juice or chill spices are offered ( only Sarachi I sauce which is not Greek or Turkish or represents the food)  The decor is confusing and has no theme to it and worst of all you can strong smell the cigar bar. Which is the business behind it , and tobacco aroma comes through the vents , and air system . The girl behind the counter is very curt and rude to paying customers and has a sarcastic tone - I won't be back and sorry can't recommend it . If you know anything about kebabs - doners or gyros , this isn't t the place  ."}
{"text":"I love the food and excellent service at Pita Café in north Scottsdale! Greek salad is my favorite - the beets are a unique touch and the dressing is delish! I stop in nearly once a week to pick up lunch for myself and have made many catering orders for my office as well. Everyone always raves about how fresh, flavorful, and filling the food is. Christina does an excellent job with the catering services. I'll surely continue to frequent this location both personally and for catering needs."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! It was such a big inconvenience for them to split my platter half falafel half gyro, but apparently they do split every other meat.. instead of making something like this work for a customer they let me just walk out not giving a dam. Good job! The cashier a older white lady was being extremely rude towards my simple request. Also super over priced"}
{"text":"I moved away from the Phoenix area about four years ago and returned for a quick trip.  A friend and I were meeting up for lunch and I originally wanted to go to Pita Jungle, she suggested this resturant and location.  She said it was really good and affordable.  The food was really good and the service was equally as good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I literally crave the pita and hummus from here all the time. My favorite thing to get is the appetizer with 3 different types of hummus which is served with tzatziki sauce and pita. I also really like getting the platters which come with tons of food for only $11.99! Everything tastes very fresh and you get a lot of food especially for the price. The employees are always friendly too. Quality service at a very fast pace. Definitely one of the best places to get some good mediterranean food and it's great that it's so affordable!"}
{"text":"I eat at this place frequently and really like the people that work there.  The food is very good and you can eat healthy there if you want to.  The service is really good as well."}
{"text":"AMAZING AS USUAL!! I'm not sure where ppl are eating at to ever write a bad review about pita cafe! Sorry but you don't know good quality or have any taste for food . I Was just happening to update my review since I enjoy myself at both locations often but had to clear the air with a review on here. Not only is pita cafe truly authentic ..every bite is filled with flavor from literally anything you could order . I have catered numerous amounts of times for huge Events and consistently am receiving praise from the food as if I cooked it my self :) (I wish) not only is the staff unbelievable servicing I truly feel like a friend when I walk in. I've NEVER had a gyro that tasted so good .. Thank you Pita Cafe for now having a SECOND location .CLEARLY your food is amazing to have the ability for another . I'll see you next week :)"}
{"text":"This is our goto, where should we get take out for dinner place. We ave had EVERYTHING on their menu and we have never been disappointed. The gyros and the falafel are both wonderful along with their tasty Greek salad is a sure hit. I should also mention that in the hundreds of times we have taken out food there has NEVER been an error on the order."}
{"text":"Always fantastic, dinning in or taking out, doesn't matter, it's always delicious, and consistently served or packaged with the highest standards. A+"}
{"text":"I had take out from here. First off, lets get some decent take out containers. they tre the old styrofaom ones and let me tell you it takes 2 seconds for the hummus to escape the container in the car.  There is no menu mounted in the actual restaurant yet, so I was stuck behind someone trying to decide for 5 minutes if she wanted a philly cheesesteak.. hmm maybe.. maybe not, hmm wait what does it come with.... Come on lady! Anyway, the tabouleh was so so, the hummus good. The girl taking my order was very sweet, and they seem like a nice operation.  I've had better food elsewhere though."}
{"text":"This place is a find. For the money, you can't find better food for the money in this area. The gyros are fantastic, and taste very fresh. The Greek salad option is great as a healthy alternative to fries. But I think the saffron rice is sooo good, especially with the taziki sauce. Yummy!  You can get a great lunch or dinner for about 10 bucks. They also have ice cream here, which I haven't tried yet. The atmosphere is nice, simple, and they have great service.   If you're in the area check it out!"}
{"text":"It was good, not great, not bad... Chicken shwarma was pretty dry and didn't have enough seasoning..."}
{"text":"Pita Cafe is the perfect neighborhood place. Always terrific, super friendly. Wife and kids are crazy about it too. Love the Southwest bowl. Prefer chicken shawarma over chicken kebab. They have a couple different kinds of hummus including jalapeño hummus. My wife's favorite is the fatoush salad. Kids are crazy about the chicken, gyro, and rice."}
{"text":"First time visit about 2 weeks ago with the boyfriend. Got the beef shawarma and gyro platter. BOY, WAS IT ALOT OF FOOD (for $10 even!). I particularly liked the beef shawarma as it was nice and moist and just enough spice. I also ordered a side of dolma and we got a greek salad with the platter. The dolma leaves were kinda spiny, but the spice in the rice was great. I am hoping to make this my \"Mediterranean place\". :D"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I am so glad it is close to my house.  The food is simple but very well prepared.  My kids love it, so that makes me sooooo happy.  I have picky eaters, so when I find a place that has great food and my kids eat it all, I consider that a winner.  They usually eat the chicken and hummus, it come with pita triangles, it is pretty large for a kids meal.  My kids love their rice, so I usually order the combo so I give them my rice.  I have had the chicken pita and the platter before.  They are very nicely flavored.  I think they spice it in a way that is a little more approachable to everyday palate, which is I don't mind, I think that is why my kids love it, it is flavorful, but mild at the same time. I always come armed with my bag of coloring stuff, so my kids are entertain while we wait for our food to be delivered.  Service is friendly and prompt.  A  mom cannot ask for more."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The gyro bowl is amazing and the gyro sandwich is great.  Their hummus is yummy.  My new favorite weeknight fast food."}
{"text":"I get take out from here at least once a week, they offer tasty and healthy fare with very decent prices. You can order online and pick up at one of their two locations. I've never eaten inside the cafe but they have some clean tables and condiments available. This is a much better option to fast food but it's just as quick and comparable price wise. I normally order the chicken shwarma platter, and you get a choice of two sides. The greek salad is great, fresh and never soggy."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my experience here. First of all, any authentic, ethnic cuisine is welcome in our area. The service was caring and excellent, the food was delicious and fresh. I am always critical of rice but this also satisfied me. I will definitely return for another great meal!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I'm probably one of the few people who does NOT like pita jungle. I have tried a ton of stuff on their menu from gyros, to salads, to chicken dishes. Nothing has impressed me to make me want to eat there.   Pita cafe is right next to my work and I was actually walking to subway next door when I saw a lot of people in the pita cafe. I looked at their menu and decided to give it a try, and boy am I sure glad I did!!  I got the Mediterranean pita that has chicken, cucumbers, feta, tomatoes, onion tzatziki sauce and Greek sauce. I was absolutely blown away. The flavor is like nothing I've tasted before in a gyro. So mouth watering!   I also got a side of Greek fries that were to die for! They have some sort of meat and feta on the fries. I took them back to work and the girls ate them up!   Needless to say, this is my new lunch spot! Can't wait to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"This place could be really good, but in my personal experience there's work to do. One of my pet peeves is luke warm food. I picked up the food to go and just drove to the car wash 2 blocks over. This is my attempt to multi task, but by then the chicken and gyro meat already were getting cold almost, so it couldn't have been that warm to begin with. All you want from a place is a truly fresh, warm meal but it's getting harder out there. I bought a bowl, which is actually a pretty cool concept. A bowl of salad with your protein and even the rice at the bottom, but how acceptable it is to sell someone a salad... with no dressing!? I was looking all over the bag thinking it was there somewhere, but it wasn't. They also give you multiple pieces of the pita bread like 5 of them, which is great! But then they give you only one small satziki side. They could at least ask if the person would like extra. But ok. One day they may get it together."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! From the friendly and prompt service in a fast casual atmosphere to the high quality ingredients. Some of the best humus and tzatziki I've had. The place is quaint and clean. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"GREAT $5 pita special, awesome jalapeño hummus. I liked this place a lot!!!!  My one complaint?.......SWEEP YOUR FREEKING FLOORS. Owners, get your teenage help off their cell phones and tell them to grab a broom. It was pretty discussing to look at while eating.  YOU GOT TIME TO LEAN, YOU HAVE TIME TO CLEAN........START SWEEPIN!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for pickup and was pleasantly surprised. We got a salad and the chicken swarma pita. Tons of very yummy chicken on both the salad and in the pita. Had to actually take some out and save for a snack later:) Happy we have a new somewhat healthy spot:)"}
{"text":"I used to really look forward to eating here, but my last visit has me asking why? Their staff is very friendly and they have a good gyro, but the chicken kabob platter with rice was so flavorless. Fries are almost always delicious at most places and the ones here are fine. I especially like their seasoned ones. I also get the feeling that they're truly trying to squeeze every penny from there customers. Generosity and sustainable efforts are always going to be well received in my book, especially in local businesses. Room for improvement."}
{"text":"Becoming a regular here.  Food always appears fresh and hot.  I can't believe I'm having to put that in a review, but for the number of times I have to send things back, it's refreshing!  My typical plate is the Chicken Schawama (more about this) with the rice and an upgrade to grilled veggies.  Comes with a little side of Tzatziki sauce.  I usually order an extra (my bad dipping habits!)  The chicken is very good - but - understand I'm no expert in Mediterranean preparation, this is  more of a greek marinated/grilled rather than what I typically ... the menu called it Shawama - not Shawarma - which may be the difference.  Regardless - it's very good!  The pita is fresh, the rice is the typical yellow rice mixture.    What I love is the roasted veggies - green peppers, onions, carrots, tomatoes, cauliflower, and broccoli.  Done perfectly.  This is the real reason I get the extra sauce!  We're there three or four times a month.  Stop on by!  Great food and friendly service! It appears they do a great takeout business as well - so take some home to the family or co-workers!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I've had in Arizona!!  So happy it's so close! The picado pita with gyro meat was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"We get takeout here a lot and like the gyros especially. Lots of meat in the pita. Both the chicken shawarma and lamb gyro are great."}
{"text":"Pita Cafe is one of my favorite lunch spots in N Scottsdale!! Great service, awesome quality food, and all for a very reasonable price!!   I would highly recommend trying their gyro combo with rice - it is my favorite - it will be verrrry yummy in your tummy!!"}
{"text":"Used to be very good. Called in an order for a gyro, told ready on 10 minutes. Arrived, paid and waited 20 minutes. Food was luke warm and chewy. Probably the last time for us..."}
{"text":"Best Greek in town. Order here a few times a week for lunch. Seems to be family owned and they are always a pleasure to talk to. Love this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Original Gyro with fries and a drink (meat only, double meat, no sauce) and it was awesome! The meat was excellently seasoned and the portions were HUGE! The location itself is small and most of the seating is outdoors but it's great for takeaway. The service was quick, the food was hot and delicious but they did run out of straws at lunch time. Lol. I'd definitely come here again for a quick lunch bite!"}
{"text":"I have been going here since it opened.  My favorite is a large Greek Salad with Chicken Shawarma. I like the new bowls for dine in.  Togo orders always consistent as well and also have a delivery thru doordash if for whatever reason you cannot pick it up.  Notice the 4 out of 5 stars, this is because i was informed you discontinued real silverware and using plastic for dine in.  Please don't do this, your more upscale than that, and it makes it more difficult to eat with plastic.  Thanks :)"}
{"text":"First time eating here and YUM! Super affordable and tasted very fresh. I had the Mediterranean bowl and it was filling, couldn't even finish it. Staff was nice and I saw them cleaning the lobby and sanitizing tables. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow this was such a delicious lunch ! So tasty and satisfying we will certainly be back My kids really enjoyed it too!  The prices were very reasonable, 1 regular gyro, 1 chicken gyro with a side Greek salad, 2 medium drinks & falafel for $22 that's a deal   The freshness was a 7  The meat in the gyros was nice and juicy and piping hot  My salad was a little limp but non the less tasty.   It was very clean, enough seating and soft Greek music playing which was a nice touch   The staff was real friendly   We will be back !"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Def. a new favorite of mine! I got the mediterranean and my husband got the original, and literally they were both out if this world. So juicy, flavorful, delicious! Very welcoming staff, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Another review I forgot until now.  Turning left across construction-strangled north-bound Scottsdale Road is a death-defying act and since you don't see the Pita Cafe sign heading up toward Cave Creek-Carefree, for a while Pita Cafe was the place I kept thinking: \"I want to try but...\" every time I was south-bound.  On a day where I was kinda-sorta hungry about two in the afternoon, I took my life into my hands and made the turn.  I am glad I did.  So far, Greek Pita at Happy Valley is my fave gyro joint.  Wasn't able to find a place closer to home.  Did try a local diner that claimed to have good gyros, but as you can see by my review, it was underwhelming and over-priced.  Pita Cafe, however---very good!  Wedged in between a Starbucks and a Subway with a nice outdoor patio, the inside is very clean and brightly lit but basically utilitarian.  When I walked in, there were a couple of tables but no one at the counter.  The young lady serving the counter was ready with a big welcoming smile.  Since I was only kinda-sorta hungry, I just went for an original gyro---lamb and beef  with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, tzatziki sauce on a circle of pita bread---and an ice tea (got the iced slightly sweetened green tea).  I ordered, handed over a reasonable $6 and went out onto the patio to enjoy a mild November afternoon and read on my Kindle.    My gyro arrived in about 5 minutes, delivered by the same pleasant girl who took my order.  It was MAMMOTH.  It was delicious.  Pita was not too dry, slightly chewy, obviously fresh.  Meat was tender and well-seasoned.  Veggies crisp.  Tzatzki sauce not too thick or too runny with just the right tang.    I love tzatzki sauce and I wish there had been more, but's just me---I love my gyros to be messy with the stuff.  I am sure if I'd had the initiative to go ask, the nice counter girl would have given me a little more.  While I ate and read, there was a constant stream of diners going in and out.  However, when I regretfully finished off the last bite of my gyro---regretful because it was over, though I was totally sated---I popped back in for a squirt more of iced tea for the road and the cafe was temporarily without customers and my young server was taking the opportunity to sweep the floor.  I mention that because a total pet peeve of mine are dining establishments that sweep around you while you are trying to eat.  Pita Cafe obviously is well-managed enough to show consideration of their customers by waiting for lulls to tidy up, and I appreciate that!  Kudos!  So my experience was limited, but was good enough that I am definitely going to return and bring DH and that way we can try a variety of dishes (meaning I will steal whatever I can from his plate!).  I am excited to have a pita place so close to home that is delicious and clean and provides such nice service.  I am glad you are open, Pita Cafe.  You are worth risking a fender-bender for lunch!"}
{"text":"I visited Pita Cafe once when it first opened like a year and a half ago, but was craving Greek food and remembered this close and convenient place! The place itself is pretty small and nothing fancy, but the food is delicious. We got it to go and good thing we did because the restaurant felt like a sauna for some reason. I ordered the falafel platter, and my date ordered the gyro platter. We had to wait a bit for our food, but not too long. Also someone working there tried to give our food to the wrong person and the cashier like yelled at them haha. But it wasn't an issue, problem was quickly resolved! My falafel platter came with greek salad, rice, falafel, and pita. It was very good, way too much food for me! Only complaint was that the mixed greens in my salad had sort of an odd taste. Like too strong? I dont know, But everything else was good. My date liked his food too, I stole a fry and it was yummy also. After my second visit I think I will be coming here more often because it is not far and I love some good quality falafel! Yum!"}
{"text":"Coming from Detroit, which has the highest concentration of Arab Americans in the country, I was spoiled with plentiful, inexpensive and delicious Middle Eastern food always being nearby.  I really missed than when I moved here.  Most Middle Eastern food that I've had here has been OK at best.  This place is great.  The hummous is the best I've had in the valley and isn't a cement-like paste like I've had everywhere else.  The falafel was excellent and appeared homemade.  The fattoush was OK but the lemon juice used in the dressing was from a bottle and not fresh.  It makes a big difference.  My only complaint is the chicken shawarma was pretty weak.  The chicken was just a basic chicken breast (not shawarma) and it was missing the necessary garlic sauce (toum).  It was just a grilled chicken pita and not at all a chicken shawarma.  Other than that, this helped me feel a bit closer to home and I enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"I am not one to write reviews, but I had to finally log on and say something about this place after my fourth visit. I work right across the street from this joint, and was pleasantly surprised when I first walked in. The young girl at the counter is always upbeat and polite, and I could not believe the amount of food I received for how much I paid... the portions are huge and the fees are small. This just doesn't happen anymore.  It's one thing to have great food, but it's another when you create a wonderful atmosphere for customers. That is the one thing that will keep me (and others I assume) coming back. From the looks of it, this is a family-owned and operated restaurant, and it makes spending my money there all that much better. In my eyes, this is truly a hidden gem in North Scottsdale and I will not only keep coming back, but sending people there as well!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!  Stopped in around 10:20AM and was happily surprised they were open so early, as I'd rather give a locally owned restaurant the business over a chain any day.    We ordered the grilled veggie pita and a small jalapeno hummus w/falafal and split both; EXCELLENT choices!  They were served very hot, the sauce on the pita was delish and the service was impeccable.  We have a PJ 5 mins. from the house, which is also awesome, but this place will def. be worth the extra drive for delicious food served quickly, hot, and with a smile.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Greeted as we entered.  We had some coupons from a previous visit and were able to use their BOGO offer which was buy one and get another half off the cost.  You can use one coupon per visit.  We got the chicken shawarma pitas with no onions.  Service was quick.  Mine came with the onions and they quickly remedied the issue.  There was plenty of chicken and the taste was good.  I especially liked the tzatziki sauce.  Staff came around to check on us and make certain we were satisfied.  We will return to this casual dining area.  Parking available."}
{"text":"The pitas are amazing! So filling and perfectly cooked. A little expensive, especially if you want a meal which includes a side, but definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"The gyros were good, the French fries were over-salted, the coke was weak, and the place didn't seem especially clean. Maybe it was the dreary decor. Yawn. I probably won't be racing back."}
{"text":"Service is excellent as well as the food, this is an amazing choice for fast casual Mediterranean and healthy option!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Clean, great service and hands down the best food! I love the southwest salad."}
{"text":"This place rocks in almost every way. The food is fabulous (and cheap!), the service is always friendly, and the location only 5 minutes away is awesome. The only thing lacking is the interior decorating. We always sit outside on the patio so it's not a big deal, but eating inside is definitely not the most luxurious of experiences."}
{"text":"The best Gyro combo ever! The pita was fresh and good deal for great price! FRESH! I had the salad as a side also fresh and good. The girl at counter was very friendly and brought my food out to my table. Nice outside patio area too!"}
{"text":"Great Food Great Service.  Went in got a few orders to go and everything was great.  Wife said the Gyro meat was the best she has had. Chicken Cream chop was great and so was the Beef Shawarma.   We definitely go back."}
{"text":"This food is awesome and authentic.  The hummus is a little on the strong side but still very good.  The kids menu rocks with big enough portions to share with mommy...the fried chicken is outstanding.  On a huge plus note I left my purse there and they kept it overnight and were very polite about returning it-- so trusting and honest place as well.  My new favorite take out and dine in for sure!  Very homey and family feel."}
{"text":"An excellent place for a great gyro. To be honest, I haven't tried much aside from the gyro just because it's so good. I like the gyro combo with hummus on the side. I get a couple extra pitas to go with the hummus. The hummus is very good and comes in a couple flavors.  There baklava is also good, however, I've only had it once since I'm usually too full to get one after the combo meal."}
{"text":"Wish there was an option for a 6th star.  I've eaten here quite a few times and have never been let down. At this point I am trying to find something I don't like on the menu. The portion sizes are perfect. The ingredients are so fresh I'm convinced they have a garden and farm somewhere in the back of the kitchen.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and efficient. Family ambiance in the dining room is very welcoming and the building itself is new and refreshing.  The hummus, pita bread and gyros are absolutely sultry to the taste buds. Don't get me started on tzatziki sauce. I'd order it by the truckload of i could! You also can't go wrong with the chicken shawarma or the crispy fresh salads. So good I might actually 'slap my momma'.   This oasis is definitely the go-to-spot for my coworkers at the Biltmore.(S5A). It's worth every mile of the drive."}
{"text":"perfect lunch spot! fast and delicious and the special with wrap side and drink so reasonable  i really enjoyed the falafel wrap with greek salad and even their non sweetened blackberry green tea was great and my husband has the chicken wrap we are fans!"}
{"text":"Everything about Pita Café is very good- good service, good food, good portions, good price. The food took a while to receive after ordering, however, the wait was worth it for the authentic, fresh taste of the cafe special pita combo with Greek salad."}
{"text":"This is easily one of my favorite quick eats kind of place! Pitas (Gyro and Chicken) are $5, you could add a drink and a side for only three dollars more. Every time I go there the food is outstanding, the meat on the pitas are so tender. The salads are delicious (and so is the Greek dressing) and their pita bread is always fresh and hot. Finally, their staff is always kind and helpful. Yum!"}
{"text":"Yummy authentic Greek food, we love this place! The gyro meat and hummus are delicious."}
{"text":"So delicious!!! Great value for what you pay and the service was above and beyond ;) The staff is so friendly, they genuinely care if you are enjoying your meal. I highly recommend!!! (Chicken Shawarma is my favorite)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed checking out the Pita Cafe today. The food was delicious and the customer service was friendly. A++"}
{"text":"Pita Cafe never disappoints when I'm in the mood for something healthy and fresh!!! The food is always great I just got the chicken shawarma platter and it comes with so much food for only $11 I now have my lunch for tomorrow too!! Oh and I love the yellow rice!!! And lastly those Greek fries are a must have .. They are BOMB.com!"}
{"text":"Since my original review, I have eaten at Pita Cafe several more times. I must say, I'm not as impressed as I used to be. I feel like their gyros have changed - less meat, shredded iceberg lettuce, lower quality overall. I've also tried several more things on the menu and have not been impressed. I don't like their rice at all, their menu is quite limited (no salmon), and when I ordered the vegetable platter, it was mostly dolmathes. We've grown tired of Pita Cafe already, but it's still a good deal for their $5 gyros. I didn't like the chicken gyro at all, though. Super dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I am in Scottsdale I must stop in...I'm vegan and gluten free and the staff is very accommodating. I got a hummus bowl with extra veggies and falafel and it was delicious! Not to mention the customer service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food was good..  But this is another one of those places which chooses to bombard your dining experience with constant, irritating television tuned.  It is a very small space and the News blaring makes the whole experience just not worth it."}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best place for Greek food in the valley! The food is exceptional. I've never had a bad meal here. The family that owns the place is so kind. I feel like I'm eating a home-cooked Greek meal every time I'm here."}
{"text":"I come here all the time.  It is my go to for when I want to get a gyro and a side of gyro fries.  I've tried many of gyro places around the valley and this is truly my favorite.  I've had the steak gyro, which is very tender strips of steak which tastes like it's marinated and slow cooked.  I've had the chicken shawarma gyro and had awesome flavor, but my usual is the normal gyro lamb/beef meat.  If you haven't had this place, I highly suggest it.  I'll continue to be a loyal gyro-addicted customer!"}
{"text":"Do you remember your first kiss? I know I do. It was many years ago but I can see it as if it was yesterday.  I was a little scared, a lot excited, and I wasn't exactly sure what to expect, but I closed my eyes, opened my mouth, and hoped it wouldn't be too messy.  That's pretty much how I felt today, at the Pita Cafe.  I went for my morning coffee at the Starbucks on Pinnacle Peak / Scottsdale Road and to my delight, a new Greek cafe had opened where the outrageously expensive Italian place used to be.  I love Greek food, especially good gyros, but it just didn't make sense that a Greek restaurant would open so close to my house. I mean, what did I do to deserve this? How could I be so lucky?  I marched inside, talked to the nice girl at the front who said they'd only been open a week, got a menu, got my coffee, and headed home to tell my wife the good news.  This evening, armed only with hope and about twenty bucks, I called in and ordered a gyro platter with french fries as well as a gyro w/ a Greek salad.  John (as I'd later learn he was named) said it would be 10 minutes and he was exactly right.  There was an annoying couple in front of me who took FOREVER reading the menu and debating the merits of different dishes. I wanted to kill them.  \"Oh, Honey! Schwarma! Like in the Avengers movie! Should we get that?\"  No, you should move out of the way so I can pay and take my food home to my starving wife.  They didn't though, but John (as I'd very soon learn he was named) asked me if I'd called ahead or wanted to order.  I identified myself and it turned out my food was waiting.  Since the annoying, babbling, debating couple was still in the way, John (who in maybe 30 seconds would introduce himself to me) whipped out this cool iPhone credit card swiper and handed me his phone to sign.   I signed away, he handed me my food, and then...  Then, he introduced himself (See? Told you. John. Booyah.) and said he hoped I enjoyed my food.  I did. It was really tasty. The pita bread was soft, not hard and stale, the meat was tender and moist, the Tatziki sauce was tart, the french fries were seasoned and hot, and the salad was fresh.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and almost couldn't finish it. The portions were sufficient without being overwhelming (I'm looking at YOU, Maggiano's) and I'm excited to try more of their dishes.  If I had any criticism it would be that they allow annoying, food debating couples to hold up lines, but hey, they're new, live and learn, right?  So, in conclusion, eat here, support John and the nice girl whose name I would have gotten if it hadn't been for that annoying couple, and enjoy solid Greek fare in a comfortable and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pita Cafe is a casual order-at-the-counter place serving standard Middle Eastern fare.  This puts it one step above fast food, but it is an important step.  At Pita Cafe the food tastes fresh probably because a lot of it is prepared not too far ahead, and it is served attractively.  On the other hand, prices are pretty high for an eatery without table service, even a couple of dollars higher than similar restaurants in some cases.  Is it worth it?  I think it is because the food not only tastes fresh but it has flavor and style (except for the abundant but bland rice).  It's a pleasure to eat here for lunch and the portions are large enough to consider it for dinner too.  NOTE:  If you bought a Local Flavor certificate after Dec. 1, they will not honor it.  The counter clerk told me that Local Flavor was not authorized to sell certificates for them after this date."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times now.  I have witnessed the staff here being consistently nice.  We have ordered pitas, a pita plate and the chicken and rice kids meal.  The pitas are great.  They are gyros.  The plate was great too.  I got french fries with it and a Greek Salad.  I could not believe the size of the Greek Salad.  It was huge and delicious."}
{"text":"First time here.   Walking up they have a nice outside patio with misters. Inside is styled nicely and clean. The girl at the counter was friendly and answered my questions.   Food came out quickly! My kids enjoyed their food (grilled cheese pita and the chicken & hummus) and I had the chicken pita which is one of their $5 specials. It was pretty good. Had tons of chicken and the pita was delicious! Also ordered the sin-a-pita too. Kids loved it! The pita bread seems to be homemade but who knows. I didn't ask. All and all looking forward to coming back and trying more menu items!"}
{"text":"Food quality is ok, but the smell of smoke from the tobacco shop next door overwhelms everything! We sat outside which helped a little. Sorry to say we won't be returning because of the smell."}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is great! All the employees I've seen are friendly! Prices are decent. I've been there multiple times and plan on going again."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite or take-out Mediterranean food.  This newly relocated food lover had some difficulty finding it initially, but now I don't need a GPS! The chicken shawarma was delicious.  The gyro platter with the Greek salad is the way to go for me!  Other sides are available for your taste.  The staff is friendly and always ready to answer any questions you may have.  One of my family's new favorite places."}
{"text":"Wow- didn't expect to be so welcome and made to feel so at home in such a casual restaurant but the staff really excelled at creating that homey vibe.  They have a lunch special on weekends- gyro pita sandwich with a side and a drink for about ten bucks. I went for the Greek salad on the side and it had beets in it so that's gotta be memorable about a salad, right? Luckily, I love me some beets, and you really do need that punch of sweetness to go with the very sharp, bright and tangy flavors (feta, olives, pepperoncini, vinaigrette) in the rest of the salad. Bravo, guys.   The gyro was really good, on a tasty pita with the usual sauce, lettuce, tomato and onion and it was well portioned. Side note: I always look for the conical-shaped antelope that gyro meat comes from in the zoo but never see them.   Usually if I see the word \"falafel\" on a menu I pull the trigger and I'm glad that I did this time because these were some of the best falafel I've had anywhere. The sauce was more tzatziki than a tahini but it was really delicious.   Nice little patio out front, great service, tasty food ... I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Usually when I write a review I don't read other reviews first so I can avoid being influenced by them but for Pita Café I did read the negative reviews first and I think I'm beginning to realize why I'm confused ... lack of consistency.  It seems some customers have had had great service while others have had poor service and that appears to be one of the top negative issues.  Next in line is the quality of the food, with most people not at either extreme of loving it or hating it, most people think it is okay, not the best they've had but not the worst.  Then comes price, with the general agreement that they are a \"little pricey\" but not outrageous.  My take on that is twofold - one is that they are in the high rent area of North Scottsdale and based on that I think their price is about right, all things considered.  My second opinion on price is that the overall size of the order is slightly larger than average. At least I don't get the impression that I got less food than I paid for.  Now some of my own observations.  My visit on a mid-Sunday afternoon found the place empty but apparently they have a fairly good flow of pickup orders.  The two employees, a man and a woman, both younger, were very pleasant and friendly, they almost gave me the impression that they acted like owners.  The place is sterile, though, no personality (definitely not Greek-ethnic) and it reeked of a fast-food chain restaurant, which is unfortunate because I don't think they are. My guess is they are a trial-balloon for someone who is hoping to come up with a franchise idea. I base that on the heavy use of non-people-friendly electronic gimmicks, it looks like they overspent on techie toys for such a small place, yet their online menu/ordering system is atrocious.  Compared to one of my favorite (and similar) Greek places where the owner lovingly cooks everything right in front of you ... and the resulting difference in flavor is night and day compared to Pita Café ... this place does their stuff hidden somewhere in the far back corners of the restaurant, out of sight of the customer.  That to me was a big turnoff, my logical assumption is that everything they serve is frozen and microwaved. Maybe that's true, maybe it's not but it is their own fault for giving that impression.  The food itself was okay.  The person I was with and I both had the platter with Gyros meat, rice and a Greek salad and we both had the identical thing to say about it \"okay, not terrible, not great\".  Sorry, Pita Café, if you want to get return customers you're going to have to do more than \"just okay\"."}
{"text":"I wish I knew where these other reviewers were eating because I cannot believe that we are at the same place. The service was super friendly and outgoing but the food? Mediocre at BEST. Under seasoned chicken. Rice wasn't horrible but was a bit on the blander side compared to other places. Gyro meat seemed like it may have been frozen. Over salted fries. Learned my lesson. Never go to a place and order a Gyro where you can't see the meat before being shaved off."}
{"text":"A breath of fresh air in the Pinnacle Peak area...the food is simply wonderful and the owner is genuinely warm and hospitable. I tried  Pita Cafe on their grand opening day and I think  may have been their very first customer...  They had everything under control...and I walked in the door 10 minutes after they opened. John is  very courteous, kind and caring and I must say that I am  quite impressed by his personable demeanor and people skills.   The menu is quite varied and offers everything from starters (hummus, falafel),  to pita sandwiches, platters and salads and have the capability to do catering also...Their prices are also very  reasonable!  Ordering is very simple and there is no fuss at having to wait for a server at a table. I found the hostess to be very cheerful and pleasant. Debit and credit card transactions are done in a snap, and you can add gratuity directly on the screen as well as sign with your very own finger!  I tried the chicken shawarma and it was scrumptious...the meat was fall off the bone tender...and everything tasted super fresh. Next on my list is the Mediterranean  Pita..and the cafe special.  I just think along with many others that a menu posted on the wall would be very useful.  I have no doubt that they will be very successful. The potential for this new little cafe is huge and the timing is just right. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice in less than a month!  That's pretty darn good for us.  At less than $7 per person per meal, this is a great (and yummy) deal.  We usually go with the chicken, beef, or chicken kabob shawarma and a jalapeño humus with pita.  The portions are just right, so that you don't feel guilty about eating too much or sad that your tummy's still not full.  Great location too.  Can't decide on a place to eat?  Go to Pita Cafe."}
{"text":"Love my hummus bowl, grilled veggies & chicken kabob on top of jalapeño hummus. I'm so excited about this place, close to home & great food, for sure coming back for trying more. I'll ask for no pitas but more grilled veggie instead."}
{"text":"I called in to place an order for pick up, nice lady on the phone! Walked right in and was greeted immediately by the young man in the front. Smelled so good there! My order was already ready for pickup when I arrived. Nice and clean place. Food is great! This is maybe my 3rd time ordering from there. Normally I get a salad but I got the Mediterranean bowl with chicken shawarma and it was delicious! Definitely will be ordering more often!"}
{"text":"I Was there yesterday for my first time. The pita was delicious. Nice big tender pieces of chicken. Place was busy with a lot of take out.  Great vibe. I met some friends there with their little puppy for the dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"Nicest people!!! Great food!!! They treated my son and me so well. The lady at the counter was so nice. It's bright, VERY CLEAN (love that!!!), and well maintained. Joe and michelle are seriously the sweetest!!!  We will Be Back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our lunch here. The food was fresh and tasty. Pita bread was the bomb!"}
{"text":"This place kind of sucks.  The ladies at the counter both times I was there seem to be impatiently waiting for you to figure out what you want and order.   This place is new so we needed time to decide.    I ordered the chicken kabobs the first time we were there.  It was very salty and I didn't care for the rice or the greek salad.  The second time I ate there I had a chicken pita which annoyed them that I ordered that way since there are so many types of chicken on the menu that could apparently be made into a pita.  The pita bread was really good so I'll give them that, but we gave them 2 tries and didn't like it much either time so I doubt will be back.    Bummer . . . we were hoping to be impressed."}
{"text":"This location is conveniently located in the Safeway shopping center. My review is based on many takeout orders over the years. The food is consistently fresh and delicious. Perfect for those days when you can't decide what to eat. Their portion size is huuuge as well; enough to share an entree. Hummus is excellent. You can't go wrong with any of their Pita's. Prices are reasonable as well. They also offer kids portions and vegan friendly dishes. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Katie was my cashier/ server and was very friendly, warm, and helpful. The food was great and the portions were so large i could barely put a dent in everything. I got the chicken kebab platter with rice. This rice was unlike any other greek place i have had. It was long grain and all yellow with a nice mild flavor. The chicken was grilled perfectly and the onion and green pepper were good with the chicken. I also got a small hummus to go and both the hummus and pita that came with it were delicious! I have been looking for good mediteranian food for a long time and have finally found it, eureka!! For $17 I got lunch, and taking home what I didnt finish will provide a snack and possibly dinner for both me and my boyfriend later tonight! Worth every penny."}
{"text":"This place has exceptional food and service! I try to come here at least once a week because I enjoy the food so much! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu! They make a killer chicken shawarma which is hands down my favorite."}
