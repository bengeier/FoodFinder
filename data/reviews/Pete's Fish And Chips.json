{"text":"Just being honest I think this place is overrated. Mac Donalds fish sandwich or it reminded me of Mrs Paul's frozen fish. Was not earth shattering. Would I eat here again maybe, I wouldn't go out of my way. Lived in Phoenix 3 years and always saw it but first time trying it."}
{"text":"Crispy fish, great fries... no complaints. excellent every time! This location is small, but on a nice day the outdoor tables are perfect. The staff is friendly. If you're looking for a fancy fish place with fancy seating this isn't it, but if you want great food in a relaxed atmosphere, then this is your place."}
{"text":"Just the mere fact that it has been in the valley for many years, and is considered by locals as a favorite.    After a good night of slammin em' back, there is nothing like a big pile of greasy fried food to coat the tummy.    I am primarily a fan of the environment.   You get out of your car, go up to the window (uh-oh, this requires human interaction) order your meal, find a picnic table, and indulge yourself.  Who knows, maybe even strike up a conversations with a stranger (oh-my-god)   Who would have thunk?  Pete's is good food at a good price....and hell, maybe a good conversation."}
{"text":"This place is one of my all time favorite bad habits.  I have no idea why people would compare a $3 fish plate to a fish entree you would get at a fancy restaurant.  If you are expecting more than a delicious piece of golden fried fish and fries served on a paper plate maybe you should fork over the $20 and go to a restaurant.  I grew up going to Pete's with my family and I have always appreciated this place for what it is- a delicious guilty pleasure cheap greasy spoon fish spot.  I could drink the Pete's sauce...."}
{"text":"I ordered the scallops and chips & shrimp and chips. My chips are fries (FYI) and my shrimp looks like chicken fingers. This is not what I expected and is very misleading."}
{"text":"Do not come here.  Wife and I feel sick day after.    Fish is shaped like pop tarts.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"Square fish with no flavor.  I've had better fish sticks from the freezer section of the grocery store.  Fries were ok.  I heard other people ordering shrimp... perhaps I'll try that next time because the fish was \"bleh\"."}
{"text":"I was excited to try since I see the bumper stickers everywhere. We order through a barely discernible drive through window speaker. Which resulted in a screwed up order. Ordered a number one with a crabette on the side. Get up there to pay to find out its cash only and have to use the ATM on the side of the building. Once everything is said and done, they don't even serve lemon wedges with their seafood. The red sauce that comes with is a mixture between ketchup and hot sauce *ew* and their excuse for lemon juice is a packet of \"lemon juice\". And after all that, the seafood was disappointing and waayyy too much bread!!"}
{"text":"Very disapointing.  Had not been to Petes for years.  Ordered the seafood combo.  Got a fish brick and some shrimp sticks.  The sauce was a watered down concoction.  Surely if your claim to fame is fish, and this is what you sell, you could get and offer better product than this.  Also, the cash only system--so not business-like.  I had driven 10 miles--if I hadn't happened to have some cash,  I would have been pissed. Apparently I have to give a star otherwise I would give zero"}
{"text":"Such a disappointing meal. Not even edible. Frozen fish, shrimp and fries. How hard is it to make fresh fish and chips. Gave it one star because I had to."}
{"text":"As a Phoenix native, there are a number of places in the Valley that are quintessentially Phoenix to me.  I've visited many of them and love them just as much as the next desert dweller.  But every now and then I have pangs of guilt and inadequacy over having never been to a place that everybody else identifies as a Phoenix institution.  Like I'm an impostor and haven't really earned my Phoenix stripes yet because I haven't visited Carolina's or Ranch Market or Pete's Fish and Chips.   Well, my Phoenix cred just ratcheted up a notch or so with my visit to Pete's Fish and Chips on Indian School and 44th Street.  This place has been here forever.  I've seen the bumper stickers (I'm addicted to Pete's Fish and Chips!) on the back of cars since, oh I don't know, birth??  It is a family owned business with a friendly, but no frills attitude.  There are all kinds of rules and restrictions, but that keeps the prices at amazingly low levels.  If you go to Pete's, keep the following in mind....Bring cash, its all they take.  Also, know that the sauce they serve is a spicy red sauce similar to cocktail sauce.  They have tartar sauce on hand but you have to request it.    We ordered a 4 piece fish and chips and a 10 piece shrimp and chips.  I picked it up at the drive thru and brought it home.  Honestly, I was a bit worried about this scenario because I thought I might run the risk of having the food be cold and soggy by the time I got home.  And really, what's worse than cold fish and chips??  Luckily, I don't live too far away and the food was still piping hot 10 minutes after we unwrapped and started eating.    The fish was crisp, flaky and delicious.  Very good with the red sauce.  I wouldn't say that this type of fish and chips is representative of the British pub style meal.  It is more in the style of beach shack dining on the East Coast.  The shrimp were less than impressive, 90% breading, 10% shrimp.  Don't think we'll order that again.  Chips were standard fare.  Nothing impressive, but they did the job.  The total for the two meals was $14.02.  Just the right price in this economy.  And even better?  Pete's is the kind of place where if you pay that bill with a $20, they just go ahead and give you $6 back in change.  No messing with a handful of coins.  We'll be back to Pete's when the f'n'c craving hits us.  Glad to have it in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"You're better off eating frozen fish sticks from the grocery store if you try ordering their \"fish and chips.\" Do not go here if you want fresh fish!! My dog go a hold of a piece of my food that feel on the ground and got sick, my dog people. Also ordered the fired shrimp, but it was just fried batter, I could not find the shrimp!"}
{"text":"By far, it was the worst food I have ever eaten. The fish is nothing more than the frozen patties you can buy in the grocery store minus any flavor. I may as well have eaten cardboard."}
{"text":"Love it , great as always. They even had doggie treats for my Gigi."}

{"text":"Well sigh...pregant me ...i was So excited to get some fish and chips with extra ranch dipping sauce I ordered on the side, after a long shopping day we were  immediately drenched in disappointment when our order came out in a brown paper bag, one dish actually turned sideways In the bag that I couldn't open to peek inside...we turned into a sonic as the fish aroma filled the car, this was our second option if it turned out to taste as bad as it smelled..i planned a cheeseburger if so. After unravelling the mess. I immediately regretted not throwing the soggy fish bag back through the window !I  Don't waste your money here. You will be more satisfied buying fish sticks from Wal-Mart and making this yourself. I figured don't  judge it until i try it..it is flavorless. Needs salt on everything. Smells. All the food is shaped like it came from the crusty crab kitchen, and now i feel sick, and to top it off. The extra charge  for my ranch came with no ranch! I ordered some ranch at sonic and attempted to eat this. Very greasy,tasteless. I don't understand how business can keep this place here!I'm really sick and so disappointed."}
{"text":"I really tried to give it no stars.  I've lived right down the street from Pete's my entire life and I have to say, after today, this is literally the last place on Earth that I would ever, ever go to eat.    When I pulled up to the drive thru, there was one car in front of me.  By the time I got to the window, it had been ten minutes.  Another five passed before the very unpleasant person in the window even acknowledged my presence.  A couple of minutes after that, I got my food, which I gave a way-too-nice \"thank you!\" for.  The lady working the window said nothing and slammed the window closed.    That was enough for me to say ok, I will never go back there.  I really don't like bad service and this was the worst.  Especially since I could have been a way bigger bitch about the wait.  At least the people who work at every other fast food chain feign niceness to their customers.   Really I just wanted onion rings, and as soon as I got home I took one look at them and thought \"oh, HELL no.\"  They were the worst I've ever had.  I also got the \"superburger,\"  which I will assume they named ironically.  I don't know how you mess up a burger that bad, but about an inch of the perimeter of the burger was more or less a fossil.  It was disgusting.  Like, take a burger from Mickey D's, shrink it, remove half of the toppings, and stick it under a 150 watt lightbulb for 3 days.    Look, I know not to expect a 5 star meal from a drive thru window, but this was absolutely absurd.  You could get a better burger literally ANYWHERE else.  As for decent onion rings within a 3 mile radius of my house...the search continues."}
{"text":"Do not waste your money or time. Went here on a recommendation, do not waste your time unless you think a square piece of frozen fish that they cook for you is good, the shrimp terrible. Staff was rude, asked for ketchup with my fry's was told to go to the store and get some if I wanted it. Was not expecting anything great, but did expect a little more than pre made frozen processed fish and shrimp. At least Long John Silvers and Captain D's batter their own. Could not even eat my meal it was that bad."}
{"text":"After a bevy of raving recommendations we tried Pete's. My husband and I were flummoxed. It was the worst fish and chips we have ever had. Frozen from the grocery store tastes better."}
{"text":"Dnt waste your $$$$ or time ...this place is nasty,  food is disgusting...worst than frozen fish sticks &  vandecamps"}
{"text":"I'm not addicted to Pete's Fish & Chips.  There, I said it.  The drive back to Phoenix from Scottsdale late at night is a lonely and empty one, especially when you're starving, and cannot bring yourself to go to any place ending in \"erto's.\"  I pulled into the mini-mall on Indian School & 44th to see if Pita Jungle, for whatever crack-smoking reason, would still be open. Of course not.   And then I saw the little Pete's stand across the street. Pete's Fish & Chips. A Phoenix legend. Bumper stickers everywhere. And I had yet to partake (why this is, I had no idea). I saw the neon \"OPEN\" sign brightly lit. Score.  So I walked across the street, and by the time I got the window, I was greeted by  A) the stench of urine which was reminiscent of many sidewalks back in San Francisco  and  B) a sign saying the dining area was closed. Drive-thru only.  Which is fine. Many places become drive-thru only at night. So I walked across the street, got into my car, and drove back in. A car in front of mine ordered and then it was my turn. I thought I'd get the classic combo -  a 3 piece plate of fish and chips. The fried mushrooms also looked appetizing, but a sign made on a desk jet printer stated they don't serve mushrooms on Fridays. Huh? Can someone explain this rule to me? Something written in some scripture somewhere that I don't know about?  Anyway, I ordered my fish & chips and I anxiously awaited my meal.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited.  20 MINUTES! I waited 20 minutes in a drive-thru, with a nonexistent line in front of me.   Eventually I got my food and the lady at the window was friendly, but no, \"sorry, son, you just waited forever for your deep-fried dinner.\" Never mind. I was starving.  I drove home as fast as I could, so I could eat my dinner before it got cold.  I took my plate out of the bag, and took the foil off the top.   Huh?  I don't know why, but I was expecting three real fillets of fish. What was in front of me looked like the love children of Van De Kamp's fish sticks and McDonald's hash browns.  \"This is the legendary Pete's Fish & Chips?!\" I thought.  But never mind....I was starving.   To give them credit, the breadcrumbs on the flattened fish sticks were well seasoned, the fish was very light and cooked just right, and the fries were pretty decent, but was this worth a 20 minute wait at a drive-thru (or conversely, sitting at the tables out front where it smells a little not that great)? I'm not so sure.  So I'm not going to put an \"I'm Addicted To Pete's Fish & Chips!\" bumper sticker on my car just yet. Maybe tonight was a one-off and they're usually incredible and people get their meals within one song on the radio instead of 5 (including commercial breaks).  We'll see.  3 stars."}
{"text":"I can understand why Pete's Fish & Chips is a Phoenix area staple and has such a loyal following.  I'd heard nothing but rave reviews and finally decided to see what the hype was all about.    When getting a quick bite to eat, I typically don't care about how a drive-through or restaurant looks from the outside, much less notice or remember much about it.  Pete's was different, in that they clearly have paid a lot of attention to detail not only making sure the food is great, but the overall experience is enjoyable as well.  Everything I saw was well-kept, and as driving around the restaurant, there was a sea-themed mural on the wall with all of the different Pete's locations within the painting.   It's good to know I can get my Pete's fix, regardless of where in the Valley I am.    They were quick- I only waited a short time for my food, and as expected, it was excellent.  I ordered the #2 Super Seafood Combo:  Two piece fish with seven shrimp, fries and a drink and #4 Chicken Tender combo:  Four piece chicken, fries and a drink (this wasn't all for me).  It's amazing how much great food you can get at Pete's for a few bucks!  I can't leave out the sauce.   I'm not sure what they put in it, but it's some of the best sauce I've had anywhere.  It would be good on anything. It's just the right  amount of sweet, tangy, and spicy.    All in all, Pete's was a great experience and I will definitely be back.  Keep up the great work, Pete's!"}
{"text":"Worst fish and chips I've ever had!! I give 2 stars because prices were very reasonable, food was hot, and served in reasonable time. But the food its self is nasty. Frozen salad shrimp butterflied to make it look bigger, dipped in a thick tasteless batter...we found ourself trying to pry off the batter just to get to see any part of the shrimp. The monster burger didn't even fill up my nine year old, the fish and chips looked like frost bitten hash browns. Won't be back that's for sure!!"}
{"text":"I will always love Pete's. I love everything on the menu, except for the Fish and Chips.  I guess that's because I am a hardcore fish and chips fan. Like from a legit restaurant. ya know, like halibut and chips, with malt vinegar and tartar sauce...ya know the good stuff Pete's doesn't serve that. LOL.  If you know that going in, then you will be fine. Everything else is bomb. I love the shrimp, that is good.  My regular meal (unchanged for 25 years) Is a monster burger with cheese (extra sauce) and a burrito. I steal my girl's shrimp.  Secret sauce is ketchup/ tobasco 50/50  I can understand the low ratings. I bet that people who rated them low, love LEGIT FISH AND CHIPS, and expected such. Don't go here for that, try everything else.  If they ever get good F-N-C I will give them that 5th star.  Oh yeah, cash only? annoying for us, smart for them...Avoiding Uncle Sam-lol with their handwritten tickets.  They aren't open on Sundays either. (bs)"}
{"text":"Horrifically long wait in the drive through.    Was charged for the wrong order, noticed by checking the receipt.  Thankfully the cashier was skilled enough to re-ring the order correctly.  Fries had an okay amount of salt, but were unremarkable.  Fish had a good crunch but was also unremarkable.  I'm more of a fan of battered fish as opposed to bread crumbed, and definitely am not a fan of the processed \"cafeteria\" rectangle shape.  Cash only is an awful policy and definitely discourages me from coming here.  The proliferation of homeless people around the area does not help.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I always see people at Pete's when I drive by, so as a fish n' chips lover I had to give it a try when I started working right near one.  I was the only one in the drive thru so the wait wasn't terrible, and the girl working the window was very pleasant and kind. Cash only so I'm glad I actually had some on me for once. There is an atm available, but it appeared to be the atm that has a fee of ~$2.00 or so. Remember when you use those you then get whatever fees your bank charges as well.  As for the food. I would like to start by saying I LOVE food and HATE complaining about it. This is not real fish n' chips. It was actually the worst breaded fish and breaded shrimp I have ever encountered anywhere. Both the fish and shrimp were crispy from the bread crumbs and deep fryer, yet soggy inside. Maybe mushy is a better word to describe it. I did take more than a few bites, searching hard for whatever it is that some people love. To be honest: Yes we are a land locked state, however you can find better fish at a bar that has yet to be rescued, or even in the freezer section at Walgreens. They do not serve tartar sauce with your fish, but a ketchup mixture of their own instead. The fries were neither hot/crispy nor salted enough.  The good: Their ketchup mixture should be fine for people who can't handle spicy (I think It was just ketchup mixed with a little bit of cocktail sauce, no burn). The serving was rather large for the price, and the Dr Pepper was good/huge.   I gave them a second try because maybe it was an off day or even an off batch, but my second opinion was exactly the same. It's not such a pretty image, but I did quite a bit of gagging once again. Maybe they have good chicken and that's what people go for? I will not give it a third try and I don't even want my enemies to have to eat there."}
{"text":"This is one of the best fast sea food places I have gone to! 10/10 would recommend to a friend! Great service and awesome shirts!"}
{"text":"I don't know where all these reviews are coming from.  Simply put, Petes Fish and Chips is the best!  Shrimp and chips taste great!  Fries are great!  Burgers are great and the burritos are great!  I think most of these bad comments are from outsiders who were expecting some 5 star diner taste.  No, this is streets not classy dine in.  Everytime we hit Arizona, the first place I have to stop is Petes!  Now if you experience different, I don't know what to tell you..."}
{"text":"I apolizes as I do just feel horrible giving 2 star I wont do 1star because nothing was mindboggling bad here ...unfortunately the following review makes it 2 star for what is inherantly wrong. .......... ready for it?   Square fish .really? Square fish...where in the world do they live..ive never caught one.   And the \"chips\" well hold on to your britches. The chips are french fries. I had no crispys of batter sitting in my plate....for gosh sakes NO!  Holy c*** ive had better fish and chip at LJS ...  Employee at the Window was ok. but wow 12 minutes for a square fish tasting grease sponge..Im sorry its just my judgment.  Oh yes cash only is a bummer  Maybe we'll try a burger at a fish restaurant. ..uhh no maybe not  I'd like to go to delux or a burger shop for a burger. ..and well.......I think I would maybe want to get good fish and chips at a place that has the words fish and chip in the name of the restaurant?  Y think?  I can't comprehend how you can serve such bad fnc.  I'm thinking it's w marketing plot to get you in. . Know their fnc ducks but since your there you get a burger. you both win. Hmmm"}
{"text":"Do your self a favor and do not eat here! I am disappointed in my self for not reading yelp reviews before hand. It was not the worst tasting food i have ever had, but it ranks at the same level as gas station food for me. I have a friend that lives and dies for Pete's Fish and Chips, so maybe I just had a bad experience ( probably not though after reading all of the negative reviews). I have no desire to go back, the only reason I would go back is to prove to my friend that this place is a bust."}
{"text":"I've always loved Petes. I've been coming here since I was a kid. We're not next to the ocean so you can't expect premium fresh fish but this is so yummy! The sauce is great, the hotdogs and burgers are pretty good too! Remember CASH ONLY! & the drive-thru might be a wait during dinner hours and the weekend. You can call ahead and pick up."}
{"text":"Sitting here eating at Pete's....my husbands favorite place from childhood. I can say its not bad, but my husband says its changed. My only complaint is that when you go to a 'fish n chips' place, the tartar sauce should be complimentary!!!"}
{"text":"For those of you who've lived in Tucson, Pete's Fish and Chips is probably the closest thing to Lucky Wishbone that you can find in Phoenix.   Every once in a while I stop in and get myself some scallops, shrimp, or crabettes with fries. Yes it's all deep fried and probably not very healthy, but sometimes that hits the spot.  Oh and remember, it's cash only but they don't take anything bigger than a $20!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was okay. The fish and chips were the best bet here. My wife got the shrimp and chips and there was a lot to be desired...mostly breaking and pitifully small Spring inside. These restaurants are cash only and don't have a bathroom. They only serve one kind of sauce and it is good but ketchup would be great for kids!!! I probably wouldn't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm in a bad mood, so let's write a bad review.  Pete's is awful. It's the same, terrible fried fish you can get at the grocery store, except the price is marked up, and you can't use your credit card. Seriously, this joint has a ridiculous \"cash only\" policy.  But the food... it's just so freaking bad. The fish sucks. The shrimp sucks. The fries suck. The sandwiches suck. It all just sucks. Like, I can't even find one redeeming quality here. Even when I was drunk, I could tell it was terrible. I didn't think it was possible to make fish and chips this bad. Pete's, you have blown me away with this newfound level of ineptitude.  And the icing on the cake is the \"Pete's Sauce\". This sauce is garbage. It's worse than ketchup, and I do not say that lightly. You are better off getting a jar of cocktail sauce from the grocery store. How can it be that bad? And how can they charge you for it? Only at Pete's Fish & Chips.  Look, I get that Pete's is a \"historic\" eating establishment, having done its thing since the 1940s. But Pete has definitely overstayed his welcome. This fish shack should swim away into the abyss.  You know what, this is kind of a bittersweet moment. I haven't encountered a restaurant this deserving of a one star rating in quite a long time. It's incredible to know that a place this ghastly can still exist today. This is truly an inept establishment with zero positive attributes.  Pete's Fish & Chips, you suck."}
{"text":"Stopped by pete's today on my way home from work and boy was I pleasantly surprised! Not only did they serve it to me in under 8 min (surprising for this location, especially on a Friday) but the fish and shrimp were cooked to perfection!!!! Another thing I noticed was the employee's were super friendly! Thanks again Pete's for serving up another plate of deep fried happiness....I'll be back next week:)"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE, HUGE, HUGE, fish&chips fan!  And this place is absolutely, positively HORRIBLE! BAD! DISGUSTING! WASTE OF MY PRECIOUS MONEY!  I was craving some fish&chips today for lunch, and have been for the past couple of weeks! So I decided since Pete's, is close by from where I am, I would give this place a try. I went ahead and gave them a call and made my order for pick up, the person who took my order wasn't the friendliest person but either way I didn't care; I was hungry. After 20minutes, I went to the location to pick up my order. I didn't know you couldn't get your order from any window! This fat ugly bitch with messed up teeth, tells me to go to the other side of the building to pick up my order!!! WTF!!! There was no body in line! Either way despite the horrible service, I got my order and left. Came home to chow down, and found out the french fries were stale! And the Fish.... looked like it came out of a frozen tv dinner that you would buy from FRY's. Chicken tenders were horrible too! Chicken tenders, were hard to eat and felt like I was chewing on pebble rocks! Not to mention it cut up my gums inside my mouth!  This place deserves for a terrorist to IED the place and blow it up to pieces for serving the worlds worst FISH&CHIPS!   Not to mention, the employees all look like ex-convicts that just came out of prison and were not butt fucked in two weeks. If your going to hire ex-convicts at least have them put on a professional uniform that does not make them look hideous and intimidating!   and NO I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"A lesser star should be given if I could, but it's worth it to me to let anyone know who reviews typed Yelp reviews, what they can expect from this establishment. Seriously wtf!? How are you an establishment that has been serving food for decades and you serve me cold fries and soggy fish? Your fries come with everything! You didn't even try. All I wanted ( after telling my gf how great you were), was the nostalgic memory of what I have eaten since childhood and you have ruined it. If there was a \"win\" for failing at frying French fries, Petes Fish and (soggy cold) Chips, would be raining champ. I will never eat here again and I definitely be letting everyone I know, know about it. I'm definitely scraping of my \"I love Petes Fish and Chips\" sticker off my bumper as well. Btw, not the first time this has happened, was hoping you were having an off day. Flavored garbage is what I'd call the \"food\" here. Sorry to see you go down the tubes"}
{"text":"Usually I'm ok with food I get here. My last trip will definitely be my last visit to this place. As I opened the lid to my half drunken cup of soda to get some ice I had a unpleasant surprise in my cup.  A long stand of hair on the inside of my cup.. Im sure you can imagine my disgust."}
{"text":"Disgusting, tried multiple items and the only fresh product they serve is the \"Pete's Sauce\". You're better off buying a fry daddy and some frozen fish to make at home... Also, don't even think of using your debit or credit card to purchase anything; cash only. If you forget to bring cash they'll let you use their ATM, if you don't mind the convenience fee. Don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"Remember when Petes used to be good?  Didn't think so.  Most of you transplants haven't been here that long.  Well if you have ever eaten at this place and wondered why the hell do they still exsist, its the same reason the Suns, Salt River Tubing, and Filibertos still exsist.  Once upon a time they were actually enjoyable.  I find myself trying Petes once ever few years out of some sort of habit or hope that it will be good again.  Never is.  The \"fish\" is awful as is the breading and oils used to make it.  The fries are even worse as is the rest of the menu.  I'm shocked the pigeons haven't given up on this place yet.  They must be more optimistic and nostalgic than all other natives.  Do yourself a favor, if you feel like taking a trip down memory lane and are craving some fish n chips, go buy yourself some Gordons and throw it in the oven.  Thank me later."}
{"text":"Well I have to admit upfront I'm biased.  The first time I ate at Pete's was the summer 0f 1978.  We had just moved to Arizona, and other then the heat and Wallace and Ladmo, we didn't know anything about Phoenix.  But figuring this was the closest place for food to my new high school , I suppose I'd better get familiar with it.  Everybody else ordered fish but but I was like wait they have hamburgers and they were super cheap.  And with gas hovering around eighty one cents a gallon, that was frugality worth noting.   But then I was taken aback  by the paper plate holding the large order of onion rings (with TWO sauces).It seemed excessive at the time but I was glad it was there when I was only half finished with the onion rings....and needed more sauce.  So after 40 years, the standard order has morphed into: Everything Monsterburger w/ cheese, Lg Onion Rings, Corn Dog, Lg Cole Slaw and an 8 ounce of  Pete's sauce.  Open up the Monsterburger and take one of (or two--I won't judge) the onion ring(s) and put on the cheeseburger and douse it with Pete's sauce.  I'd use one of the sauces from the onion rings 1.  Because you have the 8 ounce for dipping and  2.  It's perfectly portioned.  Put the bun back on top.  Sometimes I wrap it back up for a minute while I eat the corn dog (which usually comes wrapped in parchment, with a side of mustard, on a paper plate  The coleslaw is creamy and is nice to cut through the grease.  Onion Rings are the star.  Thick cut, huge, hot and covered in cornmeal and fried.  A meal in itself.    Second half of the full disclosure: Over 40 years I've received 2 bumper stickers and a refrigerator magnet.  And I may have gotten a free sauce along the way.  Factoid about the 44th Street store is this is the second incarnation of the building.  The original building was torn down in the '90's and the current building was built."}
{"text":"Absolutely asinine I refuse to do business with these people I went there I had a $50 bill cash to pay and they refused to take it they have a policy against 50 + 100 what a business model this is a screwed up place I wouldn't recommend it to anybody!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay when you eat here you have to understand what your coming for. So about me, I am a professional cook/Chef & have worked for some very prominent chefs in the USA. Now back to Petes,  I grew up on the shrimp and chips. Yes they changed the breading about 2 years ago, is it as good as the orginal? NO! No however its still good when dipped in there house made sauce \"pretty sure it's Pato & Ketchup\" Anyhow I give them 5 stars because all I order is the shrimp and chips with a side of O rings. My order has never been greasy, overcooked, salty, etc. In the 30 plus years it's been a part if my life & if you go there thinking your getting something like fresh fried jumbo shrimp you will be dissapointed. But if you know what your getting  and a Metro Phoenix native you love Petes just as much as I do. I do miss the Van Buren location however I totally support the 44th st location now."}
{"text":"Gross, repulsive, appauling, disgusting, overrated, dirty, should be shut down by the CDC.  You get the jist?"}
{"text":"I'm 52 years old and probably ate my first fish and chips here. I am so disappointed in the change petes has made with there shrimp and I've also heard they have no interest in changing it back. So I'll eat at Eds in avondale from now on."}
{"text":"Awful.   They dump 100 pounds of salt on everything.  Could not taste anything but salt.  Music way to loud.  Could not hear the person next to me.  Service awful.   Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"The name of this place is  \"Pete's Fish and Chips\"! Maybe it's just me, but that should mean that their fish and chips is pretty epic.... this place is a complete fail . Quite possibly the worst fish and chips experience I have ever had. The location is pretty dingy and has the wonderfully appetite inspiring odor of a dumpster. But let's focus on the food. The fish that they have is basically a triple size fish stick; nothing special in anyway at all. It basically had no flavor other than the oil it was fried in.  The fries that the fish sticks were sitting on were good, which is why they get 1 star. Oh and don't expect any ketchup to try and add some flavor to the food, they don't carry it at all! and if you want something other than their vinegar dip, you'll be paying extra for a little cup of tartar sauce. I also ordered the onion rings, and just as a side note, I LOVE onion rings, however these are the first onion rings that I have had that I didn't finish. They were nasty, for lack of a better term.  They were so hard that it was like chewing on tree bark, coated in sandpaper with a flavorless worm in the center.    I'm sure that after a night of drinking and smoking this would be the perfect ball of grease to settle my belly, but if you are looking for something tasty, or something to eat when your taste buds are fully functional, this is not it.  There are tons of other places to get fish and chips and onion rings that put this place to shame."}
{"text":"Went to Pete's after a couple years..ordered shrimp and was so disappointed. Scraps of shrimp in an inch of batter. Never going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have wanted to try this place out for some time now.  We finally made it in last night.  For those of you who aren't big fried fish fans, they have other stuff too like burgers and chicken strips.  I ordered the #1 seafood combo, which is 1 fish, 4 shrimp and fries.  I was expecting the shrimp to be smaller, but they were actually filet size.  Neither the shrimp or fish impressed me.  They come with two 2 oz containers of this special sauce, which wasn't that great.  The fries were decent, not great.  It took awhile for the food to be ready, but I think that's because they don't put it in the fryer til you order it.  If you do go here, be prepared...they only accept cash (they don't take $50 or $100 bills).  There is an ATM there."}
{"text":"I think they're overrated.  I was a little dismayed when I got the 6-piece fish and shrimp basket and it was 1 piece of fish and 5 pieces of shrimp.  It wasn't the typical fried shrimp, it was like they molded batter with a shrimp hidden somewhere within into a flattened shrimp-like shape and deep fried it.  I don't like extra fried batter with my shrimp.  Hate it when my sweet and sour chicken is nothing but batter either, but I digress.  The fish wasn't too bad, the batter was kind of salty but very well fried so it was crispy.  Maybe next time I'll stick with the fish.  I would not recommend the shrimp.  One plus was the drink isn't the usual 2+ dollars like they usually do at places like these.  Its 69 cents I think.."}
{"text":"Food is so-so, about what you expect from fast food.  However, no way you can call this fast food when it takes 25 minutes or more to get through the drive through.  This is the norm.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm sure everyone will be all sensitive since this is a local \"legend\"....but....this is minced fish. It's larger portions of fish sticks. Oh and don't forget about the special sauce....it's ok! Not impressed. World traveler and food enthusiast. It's mediocre. Fast fish sticks with some made up sauce that a child makes when mixing food that they don't really want to eat."}
{"text":"so bad.....cant begin to tell you. ....only indulge if its a last ditch scenario....sorry, truth."}
{"text":"I love Pete's. I know, I know - you eat outside, you have to order tartar sauce and they only take cash. I love the food anyway. I've gone to Pete's since I was born. I love the red sauce that comes with the fish - it has a little bite to it.   I only wish they would expand north.   I'm addicted to Pete's."}
{"text":"drove 7 miles to pick up an order. they forgot our burgers, had to drive back to pick them up and our \"monster\" burgers had a piece of cheese and a pickle on a hockey puck. nice long black hair inside my drink, and a thick inch of breading around a morsel of shrimp. Didn't expect the fries to be piping hot after the drive, but they were real cold. I do love the ketchup mixed with el pato, that's the only good thing about this place."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for about 20 years.  I ate here once a few years ago; I will never return.  It was the worst fish and chips I have ever had.  Mind you, I lived in London for a year, and I have had my share of awesome fish and chips and sketchy samplings from the other side of the spectrum.  This fried cake is actually unrecognizable as fish.  I can only assume that people keep coming here for the ICEE drinks, but I didn't sample that on my one and only trip here.  If you're curious about what makes this old-time establishment stay in business, so am I.  If you think it's because they have a great product and people keep returning to get their weekly or monthly fix, you're dead wrong.  The fact that it remains open while serving what it passes off as fish is a testament to the fact that the universe has mysteries that just cannot be explained.  Don't believe me?  Give it a try!   You WILL be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Petes!  I usually choose the fish and shrimp combination plate and I am never disapointed.  Yes, the fish is shaped like a square, but the taste is all that matters.  The shrimp and its breadcrumb coating is too die for.  The burgers and fries are fantastic.  The funny thing about all these meals is that they are put together by one little condiment.....Their special sauce.  It is a spicy ketchup/chili sauce, and I order extra every time.  Do not get caught short you will regret it!  If you're unsure what to try, get the shrimp.  You will be a customer for life."}
{"text":"Wouldn't you think a 2.5 star rating would scare me off? It was too late. I was in line, and my wife loves fish and chips, and this is a Phoenix institution, right?  \"Man, what if this place is great?\" I asked my wife as we waited in the drive-thru line. \"We'll really kick ourselves for missing out these last few years.\"  Instead, we kicked ourselves for going out at all. You know the fish and chips you'd get at a British pub? These are not those fish and chips. These are essentially larger, perfectly-rectangular fish sticks. I won't even get into how they tasted. Just heed Lisa C. and A F. and all the other 1 star reviews below. Pete's is NOT worth it. It's not. It's one of my regrets in life that I didn't listen to Yelp."}
{"text":"Forescore and 4 hours ago this tale begins when a blubbery old fish patty that was stuck behind a feezzer for 2 years just collecting bacteria and what not came out and saw the light of day and was deep fried for a young fella who didn't know what was coming to him. After the fella took a bite of this rotten old fish tail he could sense there was danger over the horizon but he thought he could fend off the danger and countied to scarf down the food  Little did he know that the COCK tail suace he used to dip the fish in was made from 4 year old rotten horseradish and 2 year old ketchup, ... Till dis day ( or 5 hours passing) they say that he was never the same"}
{"text":"Food was really good. Service was OUTSTANDING!!! definitely will be back......and we live in the east valley! Thank you for a nice meal!"}
{"text":"This review for the Pete's Fish & Chips on North 44th Street is based on multiple previous visits. Every once in a while, I will give in to a craving for some deep fried (fill in the blank) for lunch. Today, a co-worker suggested Pete's and I decided to give it another shot.  The first Pete's I ever ate at was the Tolleson location on Van Buren. I had seen Pete's all over the valley, and their bumper stickers, so I was curious. However, that first visit didn't impress me. The fried fish was bland and the shrimp had no texture. So it wasn't very impressive.  Then I decided to give the 44th Street location a chance to live up to the hype. After all, Pete's has been around a LONG time. That visit, some months ago, was better. The fish was nice and hot, the portion was generous for the money, but the flavor was still on the bland side. But it is a frozen fish patty (that happens to resemble a McDonalds Filet-O-Fish). And I'm sorry, but the cocktail sauce just doesn't add enough zing.  Today's visit was better. The fries were tasty and hot and the portion was more manageable. And the chicken tenders were surprisingly good. In fact, they are much tastier than the fish or the chicken offered at several nearby competitors. They were crispy, hot and moist, and again, a really good value! The breading is much better than what is used on the other items.  I know this isn't fancy seafood. Fried fish and shrimp will always have a place in my heart. It's just a little disappointing that I have yet to enjoy their specialty. I am sure I will be back again in the future, so we will have to wait and see if this needs to be updated."}
{"text":"Because sometimes you just want to flip the bird at calorie counting and healthy living.  This valley landmark is the place for satisfying that once in awhile sinful urge to screw up your carefully laid out dietary plans."}
{"text":"Ok, so if you see my profile you will notice I have never given a one star review before eating at Pete's this past weekend. I can say with a lot of certainty that I would rather get a McDonald's Fillet-O-Fish than eat at Pete's again. I am catholic and it's hard to find good restaurants for Fish Fridays during Lent- I will steer clear of this place.  The fish sandwich wasn't terrible, it was just a previously frozen square fish patty on very fresh bread (1 star for the good fresh bread).  The Onion Rings - TERRIBLE. My boyfriend said I judged the food too early by looking at it and seeing that nothing was fresh (I am not looking for Alaskan Halibut fresh from the docks, but come on. make an effort to make it decent.). I made him try a ring and he said, \"Ok yeah, that's pretty bad\".   He said he wouldn't order the shrimp ever again.  I have a feeling the burgers are going to be some amazing thing in Phoenix that I haven't tried, so I will be back to order that, but that's about it.   Hopefully other locations are better, this was not a great experience."}
{"text":"I've been going to Petes since I was a kid. I remember it was located on Van buren and the wait time was horrible. Now the wait time is a lot faster and the food is just as good! This location in particular usually gets my order perfect. I always ask that they make the fries crispy, 9 out of 10 times they will. The location is alright, if your heading south on 44th street you'll have to make a U-turn, that can be a bit annoying because it's on a pretty busy street. I did give this location 4 starts because every single Petes location that I have visited forgets to put napkins in the bag haha, and they should get with the times and accept debit/credit cards."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in here one Friday for lunch...My family grew up with Pete's Fish and Chips and I noticed they changed the fried shrimp. I loved the crispy edges of the old recipe. I liked how long the other pieces were too...the new ones seemed a bit soggy and I missed the crunchy edges. I was kind of disappointed with the new shrimp to say the least. That is all I've ever gotten there in the 37 years I've grown up with it. Bring back the old recipe!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Pete's since high school and am addicted! There are only a few locations who don't do the butterfly shrimp but most of them do! I love the shrimp, crabettes, scallops, mushrooms, zucchini, and burgers! The best part of Pete's is by far the sauce and shrimp! The only thing I do not like from Pete's is the fish(weird I know) but it's just squared frozen fish... If you want a good fish stick then I guess it's ok. It's still a cash only building but most have an ATM now. I like how they have kept with their original standards if cash only. If you have a craving for good greasy fast food then petes is your place to go! Love them!!"}
{"text":"I grew up on this place as well as worked there in high school the Owners are personal friends of ours and I LOVE THIS PLACE hand breaded onion rings, shrimp and all the other breaded food done fresh everyday. I am not really a seafood person but I will eat pete's and this place is legendary to Phx  fast food seafood plus the many other items they have.. I really surprised at all the negative reviews When I worked at this locations in High school I remember famous people coming through the drive thru all the time Alice Cooper loved this place."}
{"text":"I like fried fish so gave it a try. Don't bother. It is a cheap meal for sure but not good. Think frozen fish square on a bun. I got the deluxe which added mayo lettuce and tomato. No tarter which is incredibly stupid as it may have salvaged the bland sandwich. Especially since      they barely put on any mayo. Won't be back."}
{"text":"A sign that says order here would help, it's 2pm on a friday and they are under staffed! There was a guy waiting for 15 to 20 minutes for his order. Ouch. While i was making my order they had a girl cleaning up, she came over and asked if she could clean our table for us, very nice. She saw me taking pictures and ask if i was i told her yes and should have told her i'm yelping but i didn't want to be bothered at the time. I got my food pretty fast! The visit started really good untl I got my food! Wow this is the worst fish and chip place I've ever ever been EVER, yuck! I got the #1 one fish and 5 shrimp first the shrimp was GROSS there wasn't much shrimp to it, it was more breading then anything! I asked for ketchup and salt and pepper for my fries and fish sorry we only have salt they say! Wow this caused my not to be able to even eat all the fish or shrimp that's how bad it was, so I had to settle and try and choke down the french fries. I would never tell anyone to go here, and I will try and forget that I ever visited this place!"}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service the food is good it was a bit greasy but that is what they are so no complaints there. The lady at the drive thru asked if we needed anything else had a smile when we pulled up which is a plus. The food was packaged well and there were no errors another plus."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fish and chips fan. I sometimes get the craving to dip my fish in some tartar sauce. I always saw this place and had to try it.   Let's say I won't have fish and chips for two years. It seems like the restaurant focuses on keeping prices low and not about delivering quality food. The fish is a processed square that has been frozen and the shrimp tasted slightly like salt water chicken.   I will say the ICE-E was fantastic and can be attributed to one of the two stars in my rating."}
{"text":"The mind boggles. I don't even know what to say about this place. Where to start?!    I've lived in Phoenix for 6 years. Passing by Pete's a gazillion times, but I never stop because they only take cash and I never seem to have cash on me. Finally, one fateful day I decided to pull in and see what all the fuss was about. I was hoping for some decent fish and chips. What I got was something else.   I understand that this place is important for Nostalgia's sake. People tie memories to food and this place is a part of Phoenix culture. I get that people have gone to Pete's with their parents and grandparents.  At one time, this is what passed for good food. This hurts my heart.  Lets just lay it all on the table here; Pete's fish is pretty darned awful. The Shrimp (if you can call it shrimp) is mostly breading. About 2 ounces of breading with a quarter ounce of shrimp somewhere in there. I felt the need to dissect one just to see how much shrimp was actually present.   The fish is in patty form.  2012 and the fish is a patty. Its a rectangle. Its the filet-o-fish minus the cheese and bread. There is no rectangular fish in the ocean. What the heck is going on here?  I mean, I cant even put together a decent, well written review here because my mind cannot wrap itself around the fact that people LOVE this place. Its so bad.    The sauce is... I mean, really?! Its ketchup and Tabasco sauce.    Word is, Pete's has good burgers and I love a cheap burger . So I will try at least once more. But I won't be going for the seafood."}
{"text":"The spicy ketchup is alright. The food is alright. The fish was crispy and the price is affordable. Cash only. No $50 or $100 bills"}
{"text":"Ok, the Pete's by my office on Central just north of Broadway is great so when I decided to pick up a couple of shrimp and chips orders for my family on the way home today, I was sadly disappointed. The fries were a cold, soggy mess and the shrimp had about three tablespoons of table salt on it! You literally couldn't even see the breading it was all white and piled high with a thick layer of salt. GROSS!!"}
{"text":"I actually like eating at this place. Probably because I like the breading. Other than that it's not that great. I know, I know I like it, but I didn't like it that much when I first went. First off nothing is seasoned. Like seriously I'm a black chick and I love my seasoning. That was off putting. Also, they only have their special sauce which kind of sucks. It's only ketchup and like some hot sauce or something with a little kick. However, the last two times I have gone the sauce had no kick. Ugh, and I hate that they don't take debits/credit. Like that some shady drug funneling, money laundering type shit. I most likely won't be back. Got my craving of fast food fried crap out my system."}
{"text":"If you want to re-create this much-revered Phoenician favorite at home, here is a very simple recipe:   1) don't buy fish    2) find stale old breadcrumbs in your \"cupboard\" - form crumbs into a flat, oblong shape and insert into recycled oil from the last batch of fries you made (perhaps last year)    3) slowly bring oil to a boil, cook until a soggy golden brown   4) remove from oil and place onto an entire roll of Brawny®   5) open food-service grade can of tartar slop. dunk fried oblong into slop, bite, chew, cry. repeat.  If you're a real seafood aficionado, throw some crusty horseradish into generic ketchup and dunk in there.  I've yet to find even a scrap of fish in an order of Pete's Fish n' Chips. The name is a lie."}
{"text":"Yes, everyone else is right.  The fish and chips are awful and I don't care about the rest of the menu if fish and chips is in your name, you better have good fish and chips.  Whatever they serve is the exact opposite of what you are probably looking for.  Got get some of the cheapest fish sticks you can find, dip them in ketchup and you'll be much happier than what comes out of this joint.  What's even worse is I stopped at the ATM to get out cash so I could try this place out.  Phoenix institution?  Maybe once all those old people die this place will have the same fate."}
{"text":"They don't have ketchup, lol they just have watered down ketchup,  Litterally watered down and they charge you for it,,lol they call it there Pete's sauce and told me it's a \"spicy ketchup\". This place is a joke! Have the owners travelled outside of there bubble to see what's happening today in the real world of fast/casual food? A square fish patty on cheap bun, with cold piece of cheese, lol, and a charge for tartar sauce. Omg they need to stop! If you don't have any sense of quality or taste then go by all means, but you have been warned. Oh...and I wasn't expecting amazing but this place is silly and left me wondering how many people have \"bought\" the propaganda of Pete's sauce."}
{"text":"I would always see a lot of people here, at this location and the one in downtown Glendale. As I love fish and chips, I thought I must give this place a try. So when I moved closer to this location, I made it a point to grab it for dinner ASAP.  Well, I must say I was very disappointed. The fish is shaped in rectangles and taste just like what you'd get out of the frozen section of the grocery store. :( It's already depressing that we're in a landlocked state and obviously do not get fresh seafood, but to serve this and call it fish n chips is just blasphemous.   I won't be back. Ever.   Apparently, for a lot of people who grew up here, it's a staple, particularly for being a cheap meal. For me, no thanks."}
{"text":"They were cheap as sin, I'll give them that.  I wasn't impressed by the mystery fish.  Not impressed at all.  Any other time I've had fish and chips, I've been told what type of fish I would be eating.  Here?  Not so much.  The fish resembled something out of our local grocer's freezer....they were rectangular fish pieces.  The flavor wasn't anything great either.  I tasted fried breading and that was about it.  This may be a place that I'd go to after a late night out, but for a actual meal...I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"this is a old dilapidated drive inn.  that is 3200 miles from me right now and i would love to drive up and get a monster berger and fries. when i was a kid we would go to pete's before the drive in movie and fill up. who would think the best fried oysters in the middle of the desert. go once and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"Some of the best onion rings I've ever had.  Every ring is big and the order was HUGE.  I had to take half of it home..  And I think I'm getting addicted to the fish too.  Light and not too greasy.  The sauce is so tasty I always pay for extra.   This is low priced good food.   No wonder it has been around so long.  The only problem is it gets crowded, so I just drive through."}
{"text":"What you expect from fried food. But the hamburger tasted like card board. Stick with the onion rings & fish n chips. Great sauce!"}
{"text":"Cheap prices. Horrible food. This was my first time here living in Arizona all of my life. The fried fish patties are minced, not even filets of fish. It's like I bought them from Gordon's fisherman in the freezer section. Second the shrimp was all batter, barely any shrimp. I'm assuming that was minced too. I suggest going to Knock Kneed Lobster. Fabulous flaky fresh fish that I've been enjoying for years. If you're lazy and just want someone to fry your fish patties go down to Pete's and they will do just that for you."}
{"text":"I called in at 10 o'clock to try and place a phone order. I was told they do not take phone orders after 10 p.m. . I told him I was coming in and I was only calling out of courtesy to them so that they didn't have to cook anything just before they closed. When I show up to the restaurant they refused to serve me food and I was there about 10 to 12 minutes before 10:30. When I asked to speak to a manager one employee handed the phone to another employee so that no one would get in trouble. Sheisty  employee's.  Someone should get fired for wasting my time. Wouldn't it have been simple to tell me over the phone."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time in years. I knew what to expect. The square fish was how I remembered. I don't think it's bad. Tastes similar to filet o fish.   Fries were average at best. The most disappointing part of the meal was the shrimp. The review that said scraps of shrimp surrounded by 1 inch batter is correct. I have never seen shrimp this over battered in my life. By weight, they must be about 90% batter. It really borders on false advertising. And the coleslaw was a sloppy overdressed mess.    Pete's is an overpriced fast food restaurant, not a proper fish and chips establishment. Oscar's Pier 83 blows them away. Even Long John Silver's is much better than Pete's.  Bottom line, if you must go here. I only recommend ordering the fish. The shrimp is 90% bread."}
{"text":"A step above McDonalds. Won't be back -  I can buy fish sticks at the store - this is basically what this was. We had two orders of 5 piece fish and chips that were edible. Unremarkable and certainly not worth the money."}
{"text":"This place has the best fish and chips and the best shrimp and chips. The cocktail sauce is very original and adds a great flair.  I wish they had these in Las Vegas. This place is so good it makes you want to live in Phoenix"}
{"text":"This location is very difficult to maneuver into and they only accept cash.  I ordered the #2 Seafood combo and it was not good. The shrimp was coated with heavy batter and very bland. I think I have eaten better fish at the frozen aisle of Fry's. The Pete sauce tasted like a combination of bad salsa combined with water down cocktail flavoring. $10 meal and disappointed."}
{"text":"Can I give it negative stars? So, I've heard this place is a Phoenix institution and rocks!!  I had no idea so many people don't actually have tongues. I've had better fish that sat in my freezer for decades, which is what this mess reminded me of.  The fry's seemed like an after thought.  No tartar sauce?   What??  Very few places do I walk away from the food.  I actually felt bad for the garbage can that had to hold the remainder of my meal."}
{"text":"What a bad recommendation from my so called friends! I will never be back, nor will  I ever recommend this place... to anyone, not even my enemies. The fish was hardly a step above a fish filet from McDonalds... The Pete's sauce is basically a mix of cocktail sauce and ketchup.... The cole slaw was warm... I'm already popping tums from the grease overload. No thanks Pete's- I'll stick to the pub down the street. The single star is solely for the friendly staff, and because zero stars isn't an option."}
{"text":"i love love this place it's reasonable and the fish and chips are great! it's been around for yrs for a reason."}
{"text":"Consistently great every time I go here! Their fish is crispy and hot! The fries are a little soggy but I love'em! Their shrimp is great as well! And I will dip anything and I mean anything in their cocktail sauce! Always friendly at the window and the food is always HOT!!!! I love to eat there because it stays fresh and hot! Keep it up Pete's!!!"}
{"text":"Pete's has been in my life since I was a little girl.  I can remember going to the original location on Van Buren with my grandparents.  All of the locations look less than to be desired from the outside, but there's treasures to be found within the menu.    My staple used to be the 5 or 7 piece shrimp and chips.  Gotta get extra sauce.   While I still love the shrimp and chips, I've discovered a new front runner, thanks to my hubby J.    He's lived here since he was 5 years old and had never been to a Pete's.  2 weeks ago this past Sunday, I had a preggo craving for some fried tasty goodness.  I directed J to the online Pete's menu and he figured he'd give Pete's a try.    My order - 7 piece shrimp and chips with extra 14oz Pete's Sauce.  $6.10 J's order - Triple Everything Monsterburger.  Large chips.  $7.00 I looked at J and said...uhh...are you sure you want a burger?  He said yep.    I dont know, something about ordering a burger from Pete's always kinda weirded me out.  But I figured...it's his gut.  So be it.   I go and order through the drive-through.  A few minutes later, I get our order and drive back home.    OMG!  This burger was freaking HUGE and looked AWESOME!!  J took his first few bites and I inquired as to how it tasted.  He raved about this burger.   It was so big though that he couldn't finish all of it.  That's saying a lot cause J can eat!    Flash forward to this past Monday.  I was craving a good burger on the cheap.  J suggested Pete's.  I about fell on the floor!  This burger must have been something else!    Well, let me tell you ~ The hell with the seafood!  Order a burger, people!!!  After ordering my own Monster Everything Burger, I know where my go to burger joint is going to be from now on!!"}
{"text":"When I get a craving for fish & chips, Pete's is the only place I want to eat. It's consistent, delicious, and well...just perfect."}
{"text":"This place isn't closed. I just ate there today.   I actually prefer the fish and chips at Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe. The fish here is square-shaped. I've never seen a square fish in the sea. I prefer fish fillets to cubic patties.   They also nickel and dime you. We had to pay 81 cents for tartar sauce. Shouldn't tartar sauce automatically come with fish and chips?"}
{"text":"As a Phoenix Staple and a childhood love, Pete's Fish and Chips was an aquired taste to me. The Pete's sauce is amazing, the shrimp is crunchy and addicting. I see others review poorly however I'm gonna make my stand and express my love. I don't know how, or why, but it's just awesome to me!"}
{"text":"Well, I've lived in the area for two and a half years and never got around to eating here until just recently. I expected no frills, I figured it'd be, well, deep fried or baked breaded fish and fries. I was right, of course. My mom fed us a lot of fish sticks as a kid and I enjoyed it back then but that was a couple decades ago, I've learned to eat .. better? Anyway, I still wanted to try it out, so I did. I got the Seafood combo and dined there on the outside patio. They didn't offer me a fork, I had to ask for it. Then I realized they didn't offer me a napkin, I had to ask for that. Then I realized they didn't offer me ketchup, and when I asked for it they said \"No.\" I had this red sauce though. Worked fine for the fries, wasn't too weird. The food was very hot, perfectly crispy. The fish filet .. uhh, looked like a little fish brick with uncomfortably perfectly square angles. The shrimp .. I dunno, maybe I got a good batch because there was plenty of shrimp meat in mine, as opposed to the other reviewers here. The fish, on the other hand, was probably 30% fish meat and 70% batter. No biggie. The fries weren't soggy like the other reviewers said, they were crisp and even a bit firm. Overall, I thought this was spot on what I was expecting, maybe just a tiny smidge better in taste and as much of a smidge worse in fish fillet meat. I was impressed by the number of items on the menu; I was surprised to see burgers and other non-seafood options listed. So many exaggerated hamburger names, yet no description of any of them. I took a mental note to consider trying one of them, but someone posted a picture of it here and someone else a review, and, well, nevermind.  So, yeah. Come for deep fried greasy battered food, if that's your thing. If it is indeed your thing, I mean, that's what this is, so it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Tried the fish and chips.  The fish is not good, there is no other way to explain it.  I threw it away after a few bites.   The food is served hot and that is the only positive I experienced.   Bummer!"}
{"text":"Eaten at Pete's hundreds of times. Don't have any idea what some of these reviewers are talking about! The red sauce is the best, you can even buy it by the gallon. Usually have the shrimp and chips and a monster burger. Never gotten sick (like others have stated). Who needs ketchup you whiny millennials, red sauce has it all over ketchup, on the shrimp, on the fries and on the burgers. Go somewhere else to grab your fast food if you don't like it. Many of us 'old-timers' LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Not a fish person, so I didn't try any fish, but I did try a hamburger...and it was so gross, I spit it out. The meat did not taste like meat at all! The French fries were better than most fast food joints and didn't totally ruin my first experience at Pete's. The \"secret sauce\" is kind of addicting (kind of a horseradish(ish) concoction that could be used on pretty much anything. I've seen a ton of \"Follow me to Pete's Fish and Chips\" bumper stickers over the years and I don't know what all the hype is about. Maybe if I liked fish, I'd have a different perspective, but this place is one and done for my liking."}
{"text":"One would think that the landmark-esque building and the cash-only ordering system would have to mean this is a gem restaurant; one would then be incredibly, dead wrong.   Scared for the 10 minutes following my first cup of coffee tomorrow morning.   Good icee though."}
{"text":"This place is famous, so famous that when I am out of town I see their bumper stickers on cars in other states. However, Pete's seems to be famous like the Kardashians are, for no apparent reason. I am baffled.   Fish and chips are great if they are done right, but these are swimming in grease. Don't get me wrong I am a fan of grease and fat and all good artery clogging things, but I immediately felt sick after eating at Pete's. So did my brother and his friend, and they will eat anything. This place is cash only, so be prepared to shell out real bills for your nausea. They have food other than fish and chips, but I'm not sure I would risk trying anything else if they can't even get the food that they are known for right.   Pete's is a drive through which if you are going to go there I would recommend because their only other seating is outside. Though in the summer I suppose you could have yourself a good seafood sweat lodge if that's what you enjoy...  Anyway, some people love this place and I don't know why, but good for them. Maybe someday I'll give Pete's another try and change my mind, but for now I'll stick to getting my fish and chips elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went to petes fish a chips for the first and last time a few weeks ago. I ordered the fish and shrimp platter with chips, and a \"everything monster burger\" I believe it was called. This was by far the WORST seafood meal I have ever eaten, along with the WORST burger I have ever had as well. The fish was something I would expect Joe Arpaio to serve to inmates in his jails, I've bought better quality fish at a discount grocery store boxed by some company I've never heard of for $1.99 for 12 patties. The shrimp, well I don't think there were actually any shrimp, it was just breading. And lastly the burger, the most disgusting part of this meal, I actually vomited after one bite from the disgusting taste of the substandard meat that was used. It didn't even taste like beef. The owners of this place should be ashamed of even being open, I actually feel they should be prosecuted for serving this \"food\" (and I use that term very loosely) to consumers."}
{"text":"We are relocating to Phoenix from Dallas and like to try local family owned businesses. I am sad to say this was a huge disappointment. I had shrimp and chips (4) and could not even finish 2.  It was super bland and you can't even taste the shrimp through that fried mess. My husband ordered the fish and chips and wasn't impressed either.  The fried mushrooms were absolutely disgusting.  The only redeeming item was the ranch that came with them. I dipped my cold fries in it.  Won't be back ever."}
{"text":"Well Pete's Fish and Chips, I'm mean its good I defiantly go there a few times here and there.  Im sad to see a long list of ok reviews.  I don't think this place is trash but defiantly not a big time restaurant.  Fish and Chips is a classic meal and Pete's success is in its following.   I took a trip to England and made sure I tried out a few places there.  Its all about the breading and fresh fish.  Sad to say reviewers are right about the frozen taste.  Defiantly not a fresh catch of the day here.  Breading and fish just has that very commercial taste.  Pete must have forgotten to put the love in the food.  Hopefully the reviews will speak loud enough for the owners to hear.  I hope to review again one day with better news.  Dear Pete's Fish and Chips, Why such low stars, why so few reviews. Please don't say to your self the ok response is fault of the reviewers.  Pete your locations are popular and well known, why settle for ok, A few bright ideas here and there should do the trick.   Sincerely, yelpers"}
{"text":"I got the fish and chips, it was very good! For what it is (which is quick, greasy fast food) I liked it a lot. The Pete's sauce is like ketchup and cocktail sauce- isn't that great, neither is the tartar (too much mayo).   It was inexpensive. I was brimming and I can eat a cow, for about $7-8. Parking lot was pretty tight though."}
{"text":"I came here once and I won't come back. I ordered a fish and shrimp combo. The fish was like a flat, dry cake not dissimilar to a frozen fish cake. The shrimp wasn't even recognizable as shrimp--both the texture and the flavor was off and it was really flat and rubbery. Fries were greasy. And they charged me for an extra cocktail sauce. Don't forget these restaurants only accept cash (suspicious....)"}
{"text":"Do not get the fish and chips. I didn't read yelp before stopping by here after work. Generally when you see small, \"crappy\" restaurants they tend to really excel but the fish and chips here are awful. It's a frozen fish stick that is heated up and put on some below average fries...and it didn't come with tartar sauce. At least it was under 6 bucks."}
{"text":"My former company transferred me from SLC, Utah to Queen Creek, AZ in 2007. Being a stranger, I knew nothing; however, in a very short period of time, some of my coworkers regaled me with stories of Pete's Fish & Chips.  \"It's okay if you are really starving and if you eat there, you will regret it.\" And finally, \"DON'T DO IT!!!:  However, being a Scot, I decided to check it out for myself. My boyfriend indoctrinated me with his enthusiastic tales of childhood memories that lived on even to this day about the place. We absolutely HAD to eat there so he could show me what real Phoenicians like him love about Pete's.  On our first trip, we had a 15 piece shrimp & chips and a large order of onion rings to go. The smell was intoxicating and filled my car to the breaking point as we drove back to my place to eat. He didn't count on me liking the famous Pete's sauce as much as I do so we quickly ran out of it during the meal.  I've eaten seafood all my life and never realized what I had been missing until I had taken that very first bite of shrimp. It was GOOD! We quickly finished all 15 pieces of shrimp, the chips and onion rings. Full to the point of bursting, I asked, \"when can we go back?\" He replied, \"as soon as our food goes down...\"  Don't pay attention to what others say. Go and try the food for yourself. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is legendary in the valley, and I have to say, I have NO idea why.  I went there expecting to see things like cod and halibut on the menu, like a real fish & chips joint.  I expected the fish to be filleted and hand battered, like a real fish & chips joint.  I expected they'd know what tartar sauce is, like real fish & chips joints do.    All my expectations were dashed when what I got in my little deli basket was a preformed, previously frozen slab of \"fish\" that I could have just as easily gotten at a grocery store with a Van De Kamp label on the box and cooked in my toaster oven, and fries (chips) that might have well said Oreida on them.   And a puzzled \"WTF? look when I asked for tartar sauce.  Simply, stunningly, awful."}
{"text":"I was craving fried shrimp so I went to Pete's. I have to admit that the food was deliciously hot and cooked to order. The fries were great, but the shrimp.... I seriously couldn't find the shrimp. It was a tiny shrimp buried in a inch thick of some weird breading. The fish is not like a filet that you would expect, but a square patty instead. I realize this place has been around forever and I appreciate the nostalgia, but the food wasn't for my taste at all. I'd personally rather go through a McDonald's drive thru. To each his own though. There are people that LOVE this place, so I say give it a try at least once."}
{"text":"NO.  Don't go. Don't do it.  This was my first visit and it was on a whim because we drive by it often.    One other reviewer here made a wise statement - go the grocery store and buy frozen fish.  I promise it will be better than this."}
{"text":"You know what I like? I like cocktail sauce with my fish and my chip. And , I like cocktail sauce on my fish sandwich:) Pete's Fish and Chip's (a wholly owned subsidiary of Montgomery Burns Enterprises) takes a page from their bosses handbook when they say \"let the masses have their tar-tar sauce\". That's right they put cocktail sauce on their fish sandwiches.  That is, in fact, the sole (pun intended...it's definitely not sole in their fish sandwiches) reason to visit Pete's (Phoenix institution, I know). Try to get them to do that at your MickieD's, or your Wendy's! I know that Pete's makes other things...burgers, chicken, hot dogs, etc. For all I know, they make filet mignon on a skewer...I've never ordered any of it.  The sign says Pete's fish and Chips...I think I'm skating close to edge by having them put the fish slab on a bun:) Pete's makes a pretty decent fish sandwich...not much better than the aforementioned McD's or Burger King, but certainly no worse...in fact, it just may be the same fish sandwich...unidentifiable, generic as to type of fish...possibly even a soy based fish like food substance...I couldn't tell you...if this thing was ever swimming, it was months ago:) But, you put cheese on it and add a little cocktail sauce, and I'll swing through drive through every 6 months or so."}
{"text":"Pete's Fish and Chips is a landmark in the Arcadia district here in Phoenix. It's been around forever and my boyfriend finally took me to try it the other day. It's everything you think it may be...greasy fried fish and chips!   Keep in mind, I went to Pete's looking for greasy fried fish and chips, nothing gourmet, nothing mind blowing, just their traditional fish and chips they've been serving up since before I was born, and that's exactly what I got.   We split their fish and chips and their crabettes and chips. The batter on the outside ends up being crispy and crunchy in comparison to the soft and hot fish/crab you find on the inside. A perfect balance. Both were good but I think I might lean more towards just the fish and chips next time we go.   Each meal is served with Pete's Special Sauce which is kinda like a sweet, thiner ketchup, with a bit of a spicy kick to it. It's good on both the \"chips\" and fish. Ordering the tartar sauce costs extra and one side is enough for two people in my opinion. It's good tartar sauce but definitely heavier on the pickle/dill flavor which I personally enjoy but may deter others.   Overall it was a good, inexpensive experience and I will go back again when the craving for fish and chips strikes again!"}
{"text":"Been comin here for over 10 years, and the food is always on point. Definitely not a healthy spot, but definitely a spot for some good grub."}
{"text":"If you are new to Phoenix, stay away from this place. You will hate it.  Phoenix natives only like it because it's, well, Pete's. Nothing is fantastic. As a matter of fact, the shrimp is VILE. Phoenicians eat the fish and chips and the burgers-I wouldn't touch anything else if I were you. They only take cash, and I promise you won't get sick, but if you've lived here long enough, you already know all this.... All that said, if you plan on making Phoenix your permanent home, you have no choice-you have to go-- at least once every 5 years or so. It's required. Damn, I think it's time for a visit to Pete's...."}
{"text":"It's cafeteria food!  Don't bother.  The fish and shrimp remind me of the square fish served in the grade school cafeteria."}
{"text":"I really like the fish and chips but the time that it takes to get food is too long.  I stop by about 1 - 2 times per month because it's the only place near that I know with a drive thru and fish and chips.  However, the last 4 or 5 times it's taken more than 10 minutes to get my food.  This can easily be solved if they have food frying throughout the busy times of the day like lunch time.  They know that they're going to sell a lot of fish and fries so these 2 items should be cooked before they're ordered instead of cooking by order.  There are a ton of people going to lunch in the area and Pete's is probably missing out on their business because they know they'll be waiting in line forever."}
{"text":"Go for the burgers and coleslaw.  However, we were in a fish mood.    If you like frozen fish patties, then you are good.  We were hoping for a bit more.  The flattened, then fried, shrimp was not our style.  It was a bit chewy and not very shrimp-like.  Fries and rings were fine but not special.  We will likely be back, but for burgers."}
{"text":"Grew up eating Pete's Fish and Chips and I don't think much has changed. Use to be a treat to go as a kid and get the \"Monster Burger\" and at the time was the biggest burger you could get.   Now there are a few more locations but they still look the same.  I don't order the monster burger very often but do get the shrimp and chips and or fish.  Still have the bench seats and open air seating or drive thru.  Good for a quick bite and will be back but mainly going in the drive thru.  Remember cash only"}
