{"text":"DELICIOUS! forgot to take a before picture but as you can see it was amazing. We got 2 kinds of ribs, brisket & chicken and literally every single one fell straight off the bone! Sides were all good. Cornbread before & sugar donuts after. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Clothes code for a BBQ place?! Puh-leeze! BBQ isn't considered as gourmet cuisine. It's a fucking barbecue place! Owners are pathetic."}
{"text":"Just finished a terrific dinner at this great barbeque restaurant.  From the sangria, frozen lemonade and cornbread to the baby back ribs, mac & cheese and coleslaw, it was all excellent.  Service was friendly, portions were generous and food was out very quickly.  The free take away bag of sugar donuts was a wonderful end for a delicious dinner.  Even at 5:30 on a Sunday night the restaurant was full and a reservation helped us to be seated promptly."}
{"text":"I wanted seafood & my hubby wanted steak. I found this place off my phone & it had good ratings. Let me say. The service was very good. We ordered & we had no long wait! (really fast) The food was GREAT. The atmosphere was cool & the service was on top of it. We will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! The outside patio was great and the food even better. I had the baby back ribs they were perfection fall off the bone. My gf had the rotisserie chicken and she couldn't stop eating. We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is really awesome ! My buddy and I were here for the first time today. I wasn't too sure about it at first but the service here is GREAT! 

I had their pork baby back ribs with mash potatoes and beans.. If you like ribs you have to try these ribs they were really really good! (Ask for a side of the BBQ source) 

Our server was on point with everything super friendly! I give her a 10 :) 

We also got 10% off our bill for checking in using the yelp app so make sure you do that for the discount ;)"}
{"text":"AZ BBQ Skeptic officially converted!  I've long been unconvinced of 'good' BBQ in AZ.  I've tried them all and not been impressed to say the least.  I'm kind of spoiled with good BBQ and a bit of a snob because where I'm from, Texas, BBQ is a religion; much like chili and football.  But alas!  I have found BBQ, very good BBQ here in AZ, at Bobby Q's.  We ordered a platter of beef ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  It was properly 'Texas' sized too!  I can't even tell you how tender the beef was because my description will not justify it.  I will tell you, the VERY thick, juicy and tasty meat literally fell off the VERY large bone when simply picked up from the plate.  The pulled pork was just as good but that's not hard to mess up.  The real BBQ gauge for me was in the brisket.   And again, I must confess, no description of mine will get even remotely close to how heavenly it truly was.  It far exceeded my expectation and I'll just say, the bar I set was very high!  So, I'm a fan of this BBQ as long as it stays as is, where is.  I'll close by saying the mac-n-cheese rocked and my incredible dinner finale of peach cobbler would have made my Granny proud!   This is truly a \"don't miss\" eatery!"}
{"text":"this place never fails to amaze me! great atmosphere and service and the food is unbelievable. the catfish is amazing!"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I have ever came across the service was horrible and the mangers have no class nor customer service on how u treat ur customers we came from an angel spring training game and had 1 drink at the bar we sat for 30min until we finally asked where our drinks were and was told we were not being servered cause we were intoxicated witch was false we were told to leave cause we asked questions on why were weren't being servered not only were we treated unfairly for no reason  they profiled us for no reason..I will never go back and the most horrible service and experience EVER..they need to train there managers and employees on how to treat there customers WROST PlACE EVER"}
{"text":"Fast on refills, even provided a to-go cup when requested.
Ordered the 3 meat platter and received large portions.  Baby back ribs and brisket were tender.  Chicken was just a little dry in some areas.
Servers and cashiers coordinated very well for a party of ~20 people.  All food was delivered at approximately the same time.  Checks were split without problems.
Fresh, complimentary cinnamon doughnuts were super tasty."}
{"text":"Best BBQ food I've had in a long time. Jason, our server, was knowledgeable and very pleasant. Overall a great place for dinner."}
{"text":"Great BBQ food...have to try the Brisket it's soo tender, melts in your mouth. Great decor, chill ambience. Our bartender Chelsea was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! Be sure to try the brisket, pulled pork and mac & cheese! You can't go wrong with whatever you order. Great experience...highly recommend!! Can't forget our awesome waitress...Ashlynn!!!"}
{"text":"What a great BBQ dinner. We ordered the Hog Heaven and bread with queso dip, and both were spot on. The Hog heaven was enough for 3-4 people and with just the 2 of us, we ended up taking a lot of leftovers and enjoyed them a lot for the next few days. The grilled corn, coleslaw and mac and cheese went perfect with the BBQ. I liked the memphis more than the baby back (they were a bit on the dry side), and the chicken was super juicy. The surprise package was the sausage which my wife absolutely loved (she is not much of a sausage fan - so that says a lot). 

Definitely recommended if you're a local or visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and atmosphere we will come again bbq and smoke flavor great the prime rib was the best . We sat in the patio loved it."}
{"text":"I am not a big BBQ person but talk about comfort food at its finest! Bobby Q had the best ribs and pulled pork I've ever had. I cannot wait to bring my dad here!! Can't think of a better restaurant pick for Father's Day!
And those donuts, what a yummy surprise!"}
{"text":"Our server Jessica was awesome and the food is unreal. Ribs are best ever! The corn, potatoes and cornbread are great. Atmosphere is comfortable and prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"Wow...this restaurant is amazing. We were visiting from California and were looking for some good BBQ. We found this place on yelp, read the views, and decided to check it out.  The service was great, the waiters were friendly, thoughtful and very knowledgeable, and really went the extra mile in providing my large group with great customer service. 

The food was spectacular, made to order, served hot, and good portions. The ambiance was good as well, exhibiting warmth within a family-friendly atmosphere. 

The only downside to our experience was that we live in California, so we could only visit Bobby Q's when we travel to AZ.

For those wanting some of the best barbeque in the United States, try this place out!"}
{"text":"Bobby Qs is the best great decor fantastic food! The ribs are to die for sand the corn bread is so darn good. 
Been to the Mesa and Phoenix locations.
It's now one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I have ever had!! My husband is a rib lover and said he has never had ribs like these... not to mention they have great staff!! Chelsea our waitress was great never had to ask for a refill!! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"First time here it's an awesome place.. food is amazingly good.. service is outstanding.. a must place to eat."}
{"text":"Holy Moses! Best BBQ in a looonnnggg time!! The cornbread is so good you don't even have to put butter on it! Fun atmosphere as well! oh...must say they have the best mac and cheese ever!!!  pulled pork...amazing, prime rib....scrumptious, roast beef...heaven! My family really loved it!"}
{"text":"Lived in TX for 53 yrs and never thought I would find a better BBQ/Steak restaurant.   Just moved to Arizona.  Food was great. Wait staff was awesome.  Can certainly understand why a reservation was needed."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq joint! The brisket is incredible, but so is everything else. Love that I've never had bad service in all the times I've been here either...their servers are obviously very well trained. My family and I are proud to put this place in our regular rotation."}
{"text":"I'm sad it's taken me over a year of living just down the road to finally make it to Bobby Q.  I think it was because I moved from Florida, where BBQ is delicious and cheap, and I was reluctant to \"splurge\" on pulled pork at a place like this.  

The ambiance is fantastic, you feel great walking in.  The last star was left off for service, which I wasn't a huge fan of.  We were attended to just fine, but I wasn't a fan of our waiter's demeanor.  He didn't seem to know the menu well, which is a shame because it isn't huge.  I kind of felt like he was reading a script, emphasizing the whole \"smoked for 18 hours\" thing, which rubbed me the wrong way.

But aside from the waiter not being invited to my Christmas party, the place was great.  The food was really delicious, and well worth the money.  I believe that with an appetizer, any 2 people could easily share any entree.  

I do have to say this - if you go, do NOT skip out on the banana dessert.  OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I am a freak for banana pudding, but this treat is on a whole new level.  It was thick and custardy, cold and delicious.  The best part was the crust, which was almost granola-esque.  I've never had anything like it, and doubt I ever will... until I go back to Bobby Q for some more!"}
{"text":"Ask for Chelsea the waitress! She was so great! She made us feel so welcome! The food was seriously... Unreal! Coming from the east valley, I've always gone to joes bbq which has always been \"good\". But bobby q is different ball game all together. Puts all other BBQ places to shame!!"}
{"text":"Best beef ribs ever. All the meats were tender and really flavorful. The sides were amazing as well. Even the corn, which is usually not a great side choice at restaurants, was delicious. 
Service was good. Everyone was friendly and explained the cooking process and the food well."}
{"text":"Good stuff and priced well. I would definitely come back. Guy next to me had the Cajun shrimp. I was in the mood for BBQ but this peaked my interest...maybe next time."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I don't eat/like steak very often and tonight ordered the ribeye.  It was 14 oz of goodness. I couldn't finish it all but I'll be eating it for lunch tomorrow. Tyler was our server and he did an excellent job making my party feel at home. Everything tasted lovely. I will be here again."}
{"text":"So I live 5 minutes away from here I drive by everyday to work so we finally decided to give it a go the food and service was excellent!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place because I always heard good things about it, but was actually very disappointed during my visit. This place is jam packed on a Friday and Saturday night, but I will say their service is pretty responsive and fast to get the food out. I only got salad so I'm not going to get into the food part since it will be biased. However, the night got turned upside down when I initially got my check and saw they charged me 15 dollars for a 12 dollar salad! Side note, this place is way pricier than I expected a BBQ place would be. Anyways, I told the gentleman about the salad upcharge and he seemed like he didn't believe I was overcharged and he was like \" let's look through the menu together.\" Hello I'm not a little kid, you don't need to be condescending. Anyways, he saw that I was correct on the price and he changed it, blaming their system for generating that amount. I wonder how many people got overcharged for that salad without anyone saying something?? I still wonder if they even updated their system... anyways, not a huge issue until I got overcharged at the club/bar portion AGAIN ON THE SAME NIGHT!! This is when my nostrils began to blow smoke out of them... we went into the club which basically to get in you have to sign your name on a paper, get your picture taken, your photo id is scanned, and donate an arm and a leg(jk about that part), never seen that in my life, so strict for such a run down club... then we go to the pay section and find out it's 12 dollar coverage fee!! For a ghetto club, are you kidding me... I give them my card, and they act all quiet and don't tell me anything, all of a sudden they don't give my card back the guy escorts me downstairs without informing me what was going on... I was low key thinking I was going to be an interrogation room not knowing what I possibly could have done wrong. He still has my card in his hand and gives it to the bartender and then leaves still saying nothing to me. Worst security escorter ever! Then I get my card back from the bartender and I ask what is going on and he tells me that they don't take card at the front so I had to go down to the bar to pay the cover... I then look at my check and find out I was charged 30 dollars (15 each) for the cover when I'm told it was 12 each at the front!! The bartender apologizes and says he will get us a drink on the house... FYI the drink was the worst crap I've ever had in my life... at this point I wanted out and talked to security about my experience.. he says that I probably won't get a refund but I can go talk to the general manager. Literally the general manager finds out we want a refund(after only being there for 5 minutes) and he doesn't even bat an eye before saying of course, give these girls a refund. I want to thank him for being an intelligent person, but I hate to say that his staff are complete dim wits who should find a new job or receive better training on how to treat people."}
{"text":"TGIF meets BBQ = Bobby q.  Disappointed and misled by the yelp reviews - was expecting 4 star quality food but instead got lukewarm Cajun shrimp, bland pulled pork and corn that was covered in butter. Its only saving grace was that the meat was cooked right as others have said, but they lacked a real BBQ sauce to bring out the meat."}
{"text":"I was in town for a day and stumbled upon Bobby Q's.  Never heard of it but what a pleasant surprise.  The service was fantastic.  Our waitress was right on top of things and very friendly.  I had the rib eye with baked potato and grilled corn.  I'm a picky eater but I must say, \"everything was perfect\".  It's a shame I won't be in Phoenix anytime soon because this is definitely  a place I would visit again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent ribs and sides - the mashed potatoes were amazing. To be honest, I was completely shocked to find this place off the 17 this spring watching Spring Training. Don't let the part of town dissuade you.  Friendly and knowledgeable service, good margaritas, and really good pre-dinner bread.

Growing up in the Midwest where good ribs are not hard to come by, I would put the rack of baby backs I had at Bobby Q's right up there with some of the best I've had.  Will definitely go back when I'm visiting Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Nobody leaves disappointed.. unless they're trying to count calories.  Service staff is yummy, and that counts for something in my book too!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ. The baby back ribs, awesome Mac & Cheese and great service by Austin will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Went to Bobby Q on 7/5/2015 after seeing them on the morning news. Ordered the Whole Hog Heaven platter with Baby Back, and St Louis style ribs, Brisket, and Pulled Pork. Food looks good but that is about it. There was no smoke flavor. Brisket tasted like pot roast with BBQ Sauce. The rub on the ribs tasted good along with the regular sauce but that was about it. Food tasted like it was cooked in an oven then finished on a grill/smoker where the smoke did not penetrate the food."}
{"text":"Having read the high reviews of this place, I've been wanting to make the drive over from the East Valley for a while now to give it a go.  Not only were we more than impressed, it's definitely now on the list of must-have BBQ, even if it is a 45 minute drive away from us!

First off, I was looking forward to the cornbread since so many people have commented on it.  It was right on par - I even caught my picky 8 year old licking his plate to get all of the crumbs, which is a first.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese, my husband had the sausage and brisket with mac and cheese and fries and my son ordered the mac and cheese as his entire meal (notice a theme).  Soooo many people have commented on their mac that I made sure to mention it and we all ended up ordering it and loved it.  Even though it was absolutely fantastic, that wasn't the highlight.  My pulled pork sandwich was the best I have ever had and I finished that thing off without it ever being put down.  The meat was fall-apart tender and the sauce was a perfect blend of flavors for me (oh look, now I'm salivating again).  My husband loved his sausage and brisket and is already working on figuring out what he is going to order the next time.

Then there's the staff, everyone was extremely friendly and made you really feel welcome.  Our server (Victoria?) was very sweet and perfectly attentive.  Overall though, the place just really made you comfortable.

I would be remiss if i didn't mention the 'Thank Q's' doughnuts.  What a fun idea!  They are just the finishing touch on a great meal, great service and great experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing barbeque, wonderful warm atmosphere and one of the best eating experiences we have ever had. We were here two nights ago and ordered smoked sausage, brisket, shredded pork sandwiches and BBQ eggrolls. Every (literal) thing was delicious from the homemade pecan cole slaw to the light barbeque sauce (which acts as showcase for the food, rather than \"hiding\" behind the sauce at Bobby Q's). 

Our waitress Cristin took a real interest in telling us what special things the owner had collected and curated in his travels while developing his own barbeque style. The staff very much love working here and have a lot of respect for the food and for the patrons enjoying their food. They were so sweet and considerate to have given us beignets to bring home for our game night. 

We are from out of town but I cannot highly recommend Bobby Q's enough, and we will DEFINITELY be returning next time we are in Phoenix. Just a perfect place all around from the warm atmosphere to the stellar barbeque. And we lived in Memphis for many years and KNOW barbeque. Great job and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Bobby Q's has excellent barbeque with a great atmosphere, service, and happy hour specials.  I went with a large party (18) co-workers from all over the country and everyone was extremely satisfied with their selections. The ribs and slow cooked brisket and pork were delicious and the selection excellent.  Their desserts were delectable as well (I had the chocolate cake)."}
{"text":"So, we went back. And it was awesome.

We went on a weeknight, and, true to my review, I went whole hog, (no pun intended), and ordered a 2 Meat Barbecue Combo plate - the sausage link, and beef brisket. My boyfriend, ever steady, ordered the Prime Rib. 

Now, I don't really eat red meat. I mention this in a lot of reviews, and that mention is usually followed by \"...but this time, I did, and I loved it.\" So, I guess I do actually eat red meat now. Wacky. Thanks, Yelp, for contributing to the decay of my health and the fatty deposits inside my arteries. Do you even get fatty deposits in your arteries? Don't mind me, I'm just flaunting my lack of basic anatomical knowledge on the internet. Anyway, the beef brisket was awesome, and the sausage link was truly one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. Really! I loved it. Tasty and smokey and sweetly tinged with barbecue sauce. The corn and the shoestring fries are still hanging out in the \"delicious\" zone, and my boyfriend once again wolfed down his prime rib like a champ. He also tossed out a compliment to his side of macaroni and cheese, saying that it was \"really good.\" From him, that is a ringing endorsement.

Our server was sweet and efficient, and not at all obnoxious. A+, Sawyer! You were great.

The little bag of Thank-Q doughnuts was adorable...we didn't get those on our first visit, and, even though we were completely stuffed, we appreciated the gesture and somehow found the digestive strength to scarf them down on the way home.

Thanks for a wonderful night, Jason. Your customer service is out of this world."}
{"text":"So, the boy and I were dissapointed that they were out of the St. Louis AND Baby Back ribs. Bummer. When he then stated that he wanted steak, I acquiesced and ordered the Ribeye to share (even though I really wanted some bbq!) with mashed potatoes and roasted corn. When our food arrived, I was delighted by the tender, flavorful piece of beef. The sides were bountiful and oh so tasty too. I don't know how I managed to get a few tastes of the mac n cheese, cornbread, french fries & the warm doughnuts - but I did. Everything I tried was on point! I think my son enjoyed it too. (He thanked me repeatedly as we walked back to the car for taking him here.) Will mos def make it back to Bobby Q when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"My only time to the restaurant was a nice experience.  I loved, absolutely loved, the Q-rolls - they are the best!  The starff was super-friendly, and our server, Trisha, was just delightful and had great personality.  The only area lacking was the salad dressing ... I tried both their Caesar and 1000 dressing, and neither of them were tasty.  So, another order of Q-rolls!"}
{"text":"Oh my God!!! Best food and service ever. I'm here in Phoenix on a business trip. Found this place on Yelp, the ratings are true!!!! Definitely a five star... It's sad that I'm writing this review after only having my appetizer and their Delicious cornbread. I'm waiting for my entrée now but I can  only imagine how good it would be!!!!!! So glad we came here"}
{"text":"Food was out of this world!! We had a hard to please group, but everyone left more than satisfied. The wait-staff was also excellent!"}
{"text":"Because of the great reviews, I went of Bobby Q's for lunch with my sister for the first time. I have to say that I have always loved good BBQ and I was very impressed with the service, the atmosphere and the food!! The BBQ sandwich that I ordered was absolutely delicious! I will definitely be back for dinner to have some Ribs! I highly recommend them if you LOVE BBQ!"}
{"text":"Dan Harper and I have gone many many times here it's his go to when he has company in town"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! I am not a fan of BBQ, but this is just absolutely delicious. Even their chicken strips have a homemade batter! Super tasty! Love the complimentary corn bread and donuts as you leave!! Will definitely be back! Just wish there was one closer to North Scottsdale. But it is well worth the drive!!!

When we got seated, we waited about five minutes for our waitress to come by. Usually this is pretty typical anymore so really didn't think anything of it. However, the manager came over herself and apologized and offered appetizers on the house!! Super impressed with the quality of service."}
{"text":"Honestly, with the state of BBQ in this city I almost gave this a 4-star review. Nice smoke flavor, but had a steam-table quality to the meats (like they had been sitting in a warmer for a while). No bark with the pork and no smoke ring on the brisket, which made me wonder if the meat was really smoked for 18 hours as advertised. However, the sausage had nice snap, good spice, and smoke, so at least that was legit...unfortunately, a real BBQ joint needs better brisket/pork (did not try the ribs) to get a high rating.

This place was a good value, nice service, and satisfying food. I'll try the ribs next time, but my search for real barbecue in the valley continues."}
{"text":"Dropped by during a road trip after finding this place on yelp. Our family of 5 (all adults) ordered 1 hog heaven ($44) which included 2 ribs (we chose St. Louis and baby back),  2 meats (chose sausage and brisket), 3 sides (chose veggies, corn, and fries), and corn bread.

Pros:
- great service. Drinks were refilled before we even came close to running out and food was served within 10 minutes of ordering. The manager also came by to see how we liked it.
- open decently late (10 PM)
- Meat was FANTASTIC. Fall off the bone tender; no knife needed.
- Sauce on the meats were delicious. The perfect degree of sweet and not at all sour.
- CORNBREAD. Best I've had. Good enough to be a dessert.

Cons:
- the complimentary cinnamon doughnuts were an awesome touch at the end that I was really looking forward to; unfortunately ours came a bit stale. But because we were late diners (10 pm) and everything else was so great, I won't hold that against them."}
{"text":"We went to pleasant lake cruise and selected this place for a late lunch. It's a nice place and food was very tasty. They gave more than we can eat. Best rib combo, soft, succulent and savory meat. We do recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have ever eaten. Definitely a place where you want to stop for awesome bbq fix. Excellent service. Warning: pork ribs will melt in your mouth. staff meet you with courtesy. Excellent outdoor place for good eating and socializing. The best recipe for a great night sleep!"}
{"text":"Must try by far the best barbecue you could ever eat will not be a disappointment!!!!!!!!!! And a shout out to our awesome waitress MARA she was absolutely incredible drinks where never empty and always checked on us !!! So glad our friend told us to come try this place..."}
{"text":"Busy busy place!  Even though it's a busy place wait has never been longer then ten minutes. Stuff is super friendly and attempt. Food is great comes in big portions. Really Love there corn biscuits. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ joint; ever! Great food, service, atmosphere. And best of all the price is fair and they take reservations! Have been there 3 times in the last 3 weeks and it has been perfect every time."}
{"text":"They don't need my help.  Outstanding barbecue, outstanding service, and more food than I could possibly hope to finish.  If you order the Whole Hog, I recommend splitting it between three adults unless at least two of the people in your party are NFL linemen.  Cornbread, wedge salad, beef and baby back ribs, pork, and brisket, top sirloin steak.  All outstanding.  A must-visit for anyone who enjoys barbecue done right."}
{"text":"I really liked this place and it was really good except for my ONE rib that for some reason tasted like it was cooked on or near a piece of fish. I am not sure why that is but I was so hungry I didnt even want to complain but the rest of the ribs were fine. They forgot one of my side dishes as well, by the time i had noticed I was so full it probably wouldnt have even eaten or taken it home. The cornbread was amazing, the doughnuts at the end were a pretty good touch. The price is a little bit on the higher end to go as often as one would like, but thats ok. Maybe sometime soon we'll go back and"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but the service is terrible. I dined here with my family, when the clumsy waitress brought our food, she knocked ketchup over all over me and my shoes. She didn't even offer to provide a credit on the bill for the inconvenience. I took my clothes to cleaners and fortunately it came out. However, I took my $300 leather shoes to to get cleaned, and the oil from the ketchup and left a big stain in the leather. 

I called the restaurant to speak to a manager. No return call.
I drove back up to the restaurant to speak to a manager, a week later. She GM wasn't in, and the Asst. Manager said she has no authority to do anything. (Well why are you an Asst. Mngr). She said she would have the manager call me the next day. It's been 2 weeks and still no return call."}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel about .8 miles away as I was going to the Fiesta Bowl, and I noticed that they had an ad about delivering food to the hotel. Then I started reading the small print. Does not include tip, tax, $3 set up charge, etc. I decided to go there so I called. I told the girl where I was staying, lots of one way streets, etc. and asked for directions from my hotel. Lots of um's and ah's and she then asked me to wait until she got someone else on the phone. I almost hung up and then another dizzy girl picked up and she started stammering and stuttering without any clear directions, until she told me to wait until she got someone else on the phone, and I said, \"never mind\" and hung up. I went to the front desk at the hotel and the woman there gave me clear directions in about  2 minutes. I was on the phone with the two dingbats for about 15 to 20 minutes. I drove over and it took about 5 minutes to get there. I walked in and the restaurant was packed, so I went into the lounge to see if I could order in there. As I was walking about, I received \"hard\" looks from the guys on duty there, bouncers I guess. I looked at the jerk, turned around and went to the reception area and asked one of the young ladies how long it would take for a table for one. She said about an hour and a half. I asked her if she was serious and she said \"yes\", so I left. When I got back to the hotel, I tried to order take out without success. Even though it was before 9PM and the order form said that they delivered up to that time, they said they were not delivering. I gues it was because it was New Years Eve. When I went to the office to look for another restaurant, I met some UConn fans, and as I was talking with them about Bobby Q, they said that Bobby Q wasn't that great when compared to a few CT barbecue places or some Southern places they visited in Charlotte during another bowl game. The famous cornbread did not live up to its rep, so I felt better. Then, they asked if I wanted to try some of their food. They had a bunch of leftovers, that they weren't going to eat, and I had a microwave in my room. Like them, I wasn't impressed with either the food or the famous sauce. More hype than good food, an incompetent wait staff, and nasty looking guys in the lounge does not look like a good time to me. Sorry Bobby Q."}
{"text":"I love Bobby Q!  My family and I went here for dinner with my cousin and even though we were still full from our lunch, the food here still tasted great.  So great that we finished everything despite our very very full stomachs.  We had the ribs, mac and cheese, their eggroll appetizer thing, and tri tip.  Everything was really good.  And they give you complimentary fresh and warm donut holes!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Bobby Q's will get great food but the staff does seem a little detached like we're busy and really could you go away till another time also although the food is excellent it is also quite expensive so I would go back but I can only afford to do it once a year and I wish that I could find the perfect time where the staff isn't quite so upset that they have more customers"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  impeccable customer service,  fantastic food,  what more can you ask for? Even the manager on the floor stopped by each table to see how things are going.  10% off entire bill for first time yelp customers too. This place is a winner and I'll be back"}
{"text":"The service was very fast and courteous. I didn't have to wait a long time to be seated. Our server jason was very pleasant and prompt. Our food came out at a great timing and was still warm. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it's amazing. They're strawberry lemonade is also nicely made."}
{"text":"It took me awhile to get around to trying this restaurant, and after eating their food I was kicking myself for not trying it sooner.  I had a number of coworkers that told me it was great, but it was hard for me to believe there was good barbeque in Phoenix, AZ.  (I lived in the South for a while, so I have had \"real\" barbeque.)  Their food is absolutely delicious, and having gone back a few times I have tried a number of different items!  Make sure to try their mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"OK--so I eat out 6 nights a week. Life on the road. I have eaten in 1000's of places and yes, I could have my own food show on TV. I remember Bobby McGee's (or however it is spelled) and it was cute and fun. Nothing great... I read the reviews on Bobby Q's and so I had to try this joint. Well, you were right. This place is excellent. Sketchy area in PHX but excellent food. the Q Rolls were awesome and the BBQ sauce was a great topper, The Whole Hog Heaven platter is huge and plenty for 3 hearty eaters. The ribs (beef, St. Louis and Baby Back) were excellent, brisket tender and the chicken perfect! I don't mean to gush, but seriously... it was that good. So thats the food, now lets talk service.. Holy Guacamole... Whoever runs this joint, needs to become the main go to person for an entire industry! The service was freakin' awesome. Our waitress, Bailey, was absolutely phenomenal. She couldn't have been better and the place was packed! 2 managers came over to our table to check on us! not 1 but 2!! this place is BY FAR well worth the trip and the cost (which wasn't bad at all). Don't forget your donuts because you won't get to dessert!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ goodness!

Bobby Q's is right off I17 and was easy to find for us out-of-towners. The parking lot is huge and when we went it was really quiet.

The interior has a bit more of an upscale vibe to it, not like an old traditional bbq place. The service was good and they give you mini-doughnuts at the end.

We ordered the whole hog platter to share amongst the two of us and it was definitely enough food. I don't think it'd be enough food for three hungry people, but definitely two. We had the brisket, pulled pork, beef ribs and st louis ribs.

The mac & cheese was delicious. It was creamy, cheesy and amazing. Definitely worth getting. The garlic mash potatoes were also very good, but not as mouth watering as the mac & cheese. If I had to do it again I would just have the three sides as mac & cheese, it was that good.

All of the meat was tender - the meat feel right off the bone of the ribs and we could cut the brisket with our forks. It was delicious with the smoked flavour and sauce they put on. Unlike other places they do put some sauce on it, which is how I prefer it. It's not overpowering and drenched in sauce to prevent you from tasting the actual flavour of the meat though.

Price wise it was a little higher than other restaurants (Seems to be $18-25 per person) we had been to, however the quality of the food is well worth it. Unfortunately we were too full to try the dessert, but that's OK because there's nothing wrong with filling up with meaty goodness."}
{"text":"really good aged steak dinners.  good sides, excellent service.  
foofoo drinks, meh.  But I have never been disappointed by the steak. Big Fan!!!!"}
{"text":"I been coming here for around 6years.  The food is soooooo good I highly recommend any of their steaks and ribs. The side dishes are bomb and their corn bread and donuts are to keep coming back from them. The place is really nice but I usually do take out. Matias at the take out cashier is great he always make sure the order is right and the everything is in there he also organizes the bag so nothing trips over on the way back home."}
{"text":"Honestly everything here was awesome. I'm from Ohio, so it was a one time stop, but I would definitely be coming back if I was from here. Beer was good, cornbread was good, barbecue was awesome (brisket was delicious) and the mac n cheese was to die for! And to top it all off, they send you on your way with a little bag of donuts, too cute. The atmosphere was really nice, especially outside. And the wait staff was extraordinarily friendly and did a great job. They deserve all 5 stars."}
{"text":"THE BEST BBQ PLACE I'VE FOUND IN PHOENIX!! OMG! I can't wait till the next time we have another family outting. Everyone in my family was happy with their food. From the prime ribs to the baby back ribs to the kid's mac and cheese to the shoe string fries and to the pineapple martini... EVERYTHING WAS A TEN TEN TEN TEN! On top of everything else, yelp gave me a 10% discount for checking in! WINNING!!! I'm super excited we gave this place a try!! LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Once again this was a hit! So delicious  .. This was my husbands first time because he wasn't able to go last time and he was speechless (in a good way) We had Kristen or Kristin and she was amazing too! Thank you guys for great service and great food

{"text":"The pulled pork is amazing.  Sit at the bar with bar with Chelsea and Tony.  They are funny and great with  bourbon suggestions."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! By far the best bbq I ever had. Great service, great restaurant and great food. Can't wait to come back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Great food! The wait is worth it. I order the whole hog for my family of 4 and we always walk out with enough food for a meal later."}
{"text":"This restaurant is consistently great. Their brisket is the best I have ever had! I usually sit at the bar, and both Brian and Jason are amazing!"}
{"text":"We just started eating here last week. I guess it used to be a Bobby McGees before and these guys bought them out. Anyway, we had just picked up a friend from the airport and were on our way home. He asked if there were any good bbq places here. Since we didn't know of any, we looked on yelp. 
We got here very late, so they were about to close the kitchen. However, the lounge/club was about to open. They told us that it would be loud, once the club opened up. We didn't mind it and decided to stay. 
We all ordered food and drinks. I ordered the full plate of bbq brisket, coleslaw and mashed potatoes. We also ordered some appetizers. Everything was great. I loved the corn bread so much that I asked for more. The Sangria was good too. 
Everything is priced right and the portions are fair. Try it out; it's worth it. 
By the way, we stayed at restaurant after the club opened. Let's just say it wasn't like the food. I would never come here for the lounge/club--food only.
We're taking our friend back to the airport tonight, and we are going to have dinner here again. I hope to have a good experience again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Our waiter Travis was phenomenal!!! He was attentive, recommendation was spot on, finished with a cinnamon donut treat!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ and we had outstanding service on a Sunday evening.  This was a recommendation from the local wine bar & were very thankful she sent us this way

We ordered the combo with baby back ribs, brisket, & pulled pork.  Everything was tender, no fat, and both the regular & spicy sauces were very good.  Mac-cheese was PERFECT!  We were too full for dessert, but managed to enjoy the Thank Q's (just wait-finger licking good) we got with the bill.  A must when in the Glendale area."}
{"text":"How can this place be out of beef ribs? They should be well stocked. Also phone ordering service is sub par."}
{"text":"Rude staff. The manager is a self important moron who believes that his word is God's law. The bouncers are rude for no reason, and even when it was clearly before the time that covers get charged, they charged a cover. Never go here."}
{"text":"Phillip was great and helped us so much for our first time here! All the food was great!! Highly recommend the Mac and cheese!!!"}
{"text":"The was by far the best \"lucky find\" I've ever ran across. We were in Phoenix  for a couple nights and happened to be in a hotel just down the street.  When we drove past on Friday night and saw the crowd we decided on this place for our Saturday night dinner out.  WOW!!!!  Amazing staff who always had smiles.  Our waiter  Jason was awesome.  Honest and helpful when we told him our preferences. Always attentive and just a downright a pleasure.  I only wish I lived closer so I could explore more of the menu.  Prime rib and rib eye steak were excellent and cooked to order perfectly, sides were fabulous, desert was superb.  The Bobby-Q roll appetizers  are amazing!  Even the lemonade is made fresh from real lemons. This place is a must if you're in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Just a great experience! 
I went here for some Good-Bye beers with my wife and parents on their last day in Phoenix. We went at about 6pm on a Sunday and were shocked by the Awesome Happy Hour Deals they had!!! $3 beer specials, $3 Fireball Shots, $0.99/6 wings, and they had a grill set up in the outdoor lounge area where they were serving up $1 Burgers, Dogs, Steak Tacos! 
Our server Amethyst was great! So attentive, made sure we were never thirsty. My dad had a Bacon Wrapped Hot Dog and loved it! I went for the Steak Tacos that were hot off the grill and amazing. Seriously the best steak taco I have had in Phoenix! Simple and delicious made with great steak! Fresh toppings bar set up next to the grill. My Mom went for the BBQ Wings, and of course I stole a couple from her! 
I can't speak for their Full Restaurant Menu packed with Meat Goodies, but after our great experience here we will for sure go back! 
I personally can't wait to try the Smoked Prime Rib! I have never seen that done before, it has to be amazing! 
Great job! Thanks for the awesome service Amethyst! I wish I had asked about your schedule as I'd like to go back when you're working!"}
{"text":"A Great place to meet out of town family, have delicious food and Ice Cold beer & BBQ."}
{"text":"This is the BEST BBQ place that I've found in the PHX area.  Everything I've tried here is amazing.  The BBQ sauce is the perfect blend of tangy, sweet and smoky.  Ribs are amazing.  Baked beans are awesome.  Corn bread is incredible.  The service is always top notch.  Ambiance and setting is really cool.  

You can't go wrong at Bobby Q.  Try it.  You will be going back every time you are in the mood for BBQ."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for several years.  They never disappoint!!  The best BBQ!! I get the chicken. My husband loves the Beef Brisket and pulled pork.  Their corn is a must!!  They have Full bar including specialty drinks.  Great service and fantastic ambiance.  Inside or on the patio! We come here every time we are in town!! Family night or date night!!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place so decided to check it out.

The services was friendly. 

Their corn bread was delicious. Rotisserie chicken was more like chicken jerky. But Ribs were to die for. Brisket was moist and flavorful. Best side dish tonight would be Mac n' Cheese. 

Won't recommend their drinks though. Lemonade was disappointing, Sangaria was watery, and Appletini had no flavor. 

Over all, I will visit again, and will be smarter with what I order next time."}
{"text":"Best ribs. Pecan coleslaw is to die for as well. This is where I always come if I want unparalleled too quality BBQ. Service and staff are always on point and friendly. I usually go for the platter and get a little of everything."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. Food is outstanding and so is service. A new bartender named Daniel, knew his stuff. All the bartenders were great!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to stop for bbq!! My son loved the ribs and my daughter liked the pizza. I had a salad special order with help from Tommy the waiter. He was very nice and we got lots of attention. Clean, comfortable and watched the Olympics while we ate! Thanks Tommy and Bobby q!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best place to eat in the Phoenix area.  Owensboro Kentucky boasts great barbecue but this restaurant surpasses the flavors that I enjoyed as a resident of Kentucky for 59 years.  Great selections, attentive wait staff, and pleasant atmosphere are the attributes that keep us visiting this wonderful place.  The meat selections are varied and cooked to perfection.  Side items are exceptional.  From the cornbread to the finishing touch of freshly made cinnamon donuts, you will never be disappointed with your dining experience.

{"text":"We had the brisket, baby back ribs and pulled porked. All smoked to perfection. Our waiter, Jason, provided an amazing dining experience!  Two thumbs up for Bobby Q's."}
{"text":"I must say this BBQ restaurant is great. I just moved here from Cali and I was feeling sad because that means no homemade Que for the holiday. I looked this place up and I'm glad I visited. Great customer service and the food was all yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times now and this is hands down the best BBQ I have ever eaten in my life! The meat is SO tender and delicious and the sides are heavenly.  Any appetizer is amazing- I love the Q Rolls!  Basically, you have to go here to understand!"}
{"text":"This chain is our favorite barbecue restaurant in Phoenix. The food is consistently very good.  Our waiter was very good and they offer a few cinnamon donuts to take with you for your sweet tooth. We think their wine is overpriced however. We ordered a house Cabernet and was shocked that it was $16 a glass when we got the bill!!!  Do not order wine!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Albuquerque and happened upon Bobby-Q....excellent food snd service. Cornbread was great and the brisket was perfect! Must try when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food was only moderately good. Definitely not worth going back. If not for atmosphere and nice waiter I might have complained."}
{"text":"Best place in Phoenix! Came here for lunch and dinnet! Atmosphere nice, service great and food is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place serves very good BBQ and the service is up to the task.  The ribs are wonderful as are the burgers and kids meals.  It's nice to have a \"go to\"  BBQ joint in the valley.  Hope you all enjoy the food, atmosphere, and service as much as we do."}
{"text":"This is likely the best BBQ to be found in the Phoenix metro.  It's far and away better than anything to be had in southern California and comparable to the mid-range places in more BBQ-centric parts of the U.S.  In Phoenix, that puts it at 4 stars and I'd give it 5 if I didn't have such a great experience at another BBQ joint a month before in another state.

Bottom line: if you desperately need a BBQ fix, you could do a lot worse in Phoenix and if you are a little less desperate and just looking for some good BBQ, you will still leave satisfied."}
{"text":"We ordered Smokehouse burger, full rack of baby back rib and catfish Poboy. All excellent. Great experience."}
{"text":"Great place, I will be coming back but if you wanna eat here make sure you call ahead for reservations or you will be waiting about a hour to eat..."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, Service was great and atmosphere was wonderful! I wasn't impressed with the cole slaw that a lot of reviews raved about... But the little donuts they give you when you leave were yummy! Kind of has a weird entrance, but over all we enjoyed our date night here."}
{"text":"Awesome food! The Q rolls are AMAZING!
The meat on the ribs falls off of the bone! Huge servings... guaranteed to be taking some home!!
We have been twice. Once the service was great and our recent experience the service was slow. Wanted more drinks but she never came by."}
{"text":"Some of the best bbq that I have had in Arizona.  It was worth the trip.  Just moved from Colorado and didn't want to wait in line for 45 minutes.  No lines sat down immediately."}
{"text":"Like a little slice of good southern bbq dropped into the Arizona desert... Huge portions,  very well balanced sauces, and awesome happy hour specials. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bobby Qs is a place I trust for great food. Tonight was no exception to that. Come here for the best in town ribs and corn bread."}
{"text":"Love bobby q but if you're coming around dinner time it's best to make a reservation otherwise the wait for walk ins could be 1 hr long. The food is delicious and the service is very good too. My favorite spot for some ribs."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon the 4 of us arrived at Bobby Q. My elderly Aunt and her older sister and another friend makeup our dinner group. We were greeted and seated right away. There were two walkers in the group but no problem as the aisles were plenty wide and there was room to store them nearby.

Ashely was our server and while she was taking our beverage orders I mentioned \"Yelp\" for our discount, very nice! She also gave us seperate checks without a complaint,a very professional and a delightful person.

My Aunts had never heard of Yelp and thought they would have to exclaim \"yelp\"! to get the discount, very funny!!

I orderd the onion block which arrived quickly, the only better one we had tasted was the one from Tona Roma's now closed on Bell Rd.

I ordered the St Louis Ribs and they were sensational. I have had ribs all over and the \"smokey\" quality was the best and the amount of sauce perfect. The fact that they were hanging off the platter was very nice as well. My sides were a baked potato and grilled vegetables. The potato was large and piping hot, I \"hot potatoed\" myself twice, just the way I like. The veges were generous and delicious.

Two of the ladies orderd the Baby Backs Ribs and the comments were very positive. They ordered a variety of sides which were all well received. 

One misstep was that a side of Mac and Cheese was received instead of the Pecan Slaw. No problem, the young man who brought out the plates returned with the desired slaw and more of the popular corn bread within a minute.

All in all, a great meal! All of us took heavy boxes home and the \"Thank You\" donuts were cute."}
{"text":"Amazing everything. Visited on a Monday during lunch time. There was no wait. 

Great customer service from wait staff. Waters were always full and didn't wait long for anything. 

MUST TRY the St. Louis Ribs and sausages. 

The brisket can be slightly dry. 

Recommend coming for weekday lunch prices since prices can be on the high side for dinner/weekends, but I feel like it's worth it."}
{"text":"Came in here for dinner while staying in North Phoenix. Seated immediately (even though it looked busy!), waiter was friendly and made great beer, wine, and food suggestions. We ended up splitting a platter with St. Louis ribs, beef brisket, and smoked sausage with Mac and cheese and a dressed baked potato on the side. Scrumptious! Finished with a surprise bag of fresh homemade cinnamon donuts. If it wasn't so far from my home in the east valley I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great food, great service! I loved his place and definitely will return. I suggest making a reservation otherwise the wait could be long but still worth it! We had reservations and seated within 10 min. I overheard the hostess telling other patrons the wait could be 45 min. I had the smoked chicken and it was delish. The cornbread was pretty good too, nothing like mom's but for a restaurant probably some of the best I had. The Mac and cheese was ok. Highly recommend if you have a taste for some bbq!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  Great atmosphere and service. Lunch platter is a CANT MISS. 
Homemade mac and Cheese side is amazing"}
{"text":"Steak and Crab? Yes, please.

For 15 bucks? Whhhhaaaaa? Hell yes! 

These are questions my friend asked, when she wondered if I wanted to go to Bobby Qs the other night. Honestly, I did not get my hopes up, and prepared myself for a rough ride home. Yes, in case you are wondering, I have had some bad experiences with Seafood.

We decided to sit on the patio and were promptly attended to. I ordered a bloody mary, the rest beers. The bloody mary was freaking tasty. Spicy and tasty. 

We all ended up ordering the Steak and Crab special. I ordered a Caesar to start with. The Caesar was good. Nothing amazing, but solid.

Then there came the Crab. Half a snow crab, with an 8oz Steak and a side of roasted corn. As I started drooling, my stomach did a backflip from excitement. The crab was awesome! Not chewy or fishy tasting. The steak was great as well, and the corn was nice and smokey.

The only negative...the server was a bit forgetful at times. Honestly, once the crab and I had our moment...I no longer cared.."}
{"text":"Directions say address is N 27th Ave.  Don't believe it.  Regardless of which direction you are coming from, exit I-17 at 207, Dunlap Ave., and go south on the west frontage road.  When 27th splits off stay on the frontage road and the place is just ahead.  We had the whole hog, which is two half racks of ribs, two platters of meat, and three sides.  We fed three and still took a box home.  The baby back ribs were succulent and tasty, and the St. Louis ribs were almost as good, but the brisket was to die for.  Not the best BBQ I have ever had, but clearly the best in Arizona.  I will go back when I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My wife and I came to dinner for our weekly date night.  Our waitress forgot to ring in our appetizer. Unprovoked the manager came and immediatly appolagized gave our appetizer and dessert for free. the whole hog heaven is the best Bar B Q we have ever eaten incredible service!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy!! My boyfriend and I came here because of all the great yelp reviews, I mentioned Yelp and got a 10% discount :) Jeffery was our server and he was awesome!! We are from San Diego so we were curious to see if Bobby Q's is up there with Phil's.. I still think Phil's has the best baby back ribs but Bobby Q's pulled pork and beef brisket tasted amazing!! Try Bobby Q's you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoyed this place.  There was a great buzz and energy level.  The waitress was friendly and helpful.  We shared 4 different kinds of their BBQ meats, and they were all delicious.  The brisket was fantastic.  We also shared 4 sides and they were all terrific; the corn was really great."}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah, the name of this joint leaves something to be desired. I don't eat a lot of BBQ because most of the places in San Diego aren't very good. Man, did this place set the bar(bq) high for future BBQ spots.

I had the half slab of spicy bbq ribs with potato salad and mac and cheese. The amount of food that they brought out could have fed three of me- I can't imagine how much food they give you with the full slab. The ribs were incredibly tender and fell right off the bone. The SAUCE was amazingly delicious. I can't even describe it other than that it was so good that I wanted to order a pitcher of it and pour it over everything. 

I am a total potato salad guy and this potato salad hit the spot. Perfect blend of ingredients. The Mac and Cheese was just otherworldy with the amount of delicious cheesey gooeyness that it was. All in all I think I gained 30 pounds just from eating half of the meal.

Even if you don't order a dessert, they end your meal with some homemade mini doughnuts (yeah I spelled it out)! It's a perfect treat even if you have to take them home to eat them. Heat them back up before you do. 

I will definitely go back here next time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to Yelp our dinner location. This place came up at the top of the search with over 500 reviews, you know we had to see what all the fuss was about. Coming down 27th street we thought Google Maps was getting us lost. There was no way a bomb BBQ joint was next to all these apartments. Well once we passed the last apartment building on the right, we saw Bobby's. The building was not impressive from the parking lot, not to mention we were parked behind the restaurant. I thought rusty shack = good food. I was glad I stuck with my instinct. 
We turned the corner and could instantly smell the smoker putting in work on slabs of ribs and brisket. Inside the decor was modern and clean. After seating we were greeted quickly and with a smile. I could hardly listen to what she saying because my eyes were fixated on the 40 chickens rolling in the rotisserie oven. We ordered the Hog Heaven plate for three of us, while my son had the smokehouse burger. Let me just say this is plenty of food for a family of 4. Four choices of meats with three sides. I highly recommend the baby back ribs as one of the meats. If you have no teeth, you can still chew these. My mouth had an orgasm when I bit into them. They were so tender, there was no knife needed to separate them. The brisket, St. Louis ribs, and chicken rounded out the plate. Mac and cheese side dish is a must! So creamy and the cheese was outstanding. You can tell that time was taken to prepare our meal that came out quickly. The cornbread was oven hot and was perfectly cooked with a hint of crunchiness on the edges. I had the Bobby Q Ale for my drink and it was a solid choice. It was very bold and complimented the BBQ sauce that was all over my fingers. Visit this place in the near future, hopefully your experience is as good as mine. This spot moved into the first priority when dining out in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Mark,
You asked what the favorite food was - I think my personal favorite was the veggies, believe it or not!  lol

Everything truly was awesome, and thanks so much for it all...   Did I mention that they also provided plates and plasticware!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Very tasty! I would definitely recommend this establishment to anyone that likes licking their fingers!!! 

There you go!"}
{"text":"Fantastic barbecue. Hands down the best in the Valley, and this coming from a born & bred Midwesterner that is used to blue ribbon Kansas City BBQ."}
{"text":"Great Barbeque!! Atmosphere is a bit loud. Food was delicious and hot."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! the Babyback ribs, just fall off the bone! The place had a great atmosphere, great service and great food. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love their mac n cheese! Best BBQ spot in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both times I got the St. Louis style ribs because they were so good the first time. My fiance also got a similar dish when we went back, because his brisket was amazing. Macaroni and cheese is also amazing. Corn bread, roasted corn, and other sides are good but not outstanding. The free donuts at the end of the meal add a nice taste of sweet without going overboard on a huge dessert. One time my sister got the pizza, which looked like it could have come frozen from a supermarket. I'd say stick with the BBQ meats and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"What a test of a business - we were here Sunday and came back tonight. My husband requested it for his birthday. Again, great service. This time Kody was our server and did a fantastic job! Jo the manager was fantastic! Thank you again!"}
{"text":"We had a set reservation for 3:45PM on Mother's Day. As you can imagine, it was quite busy with families celebrating Mother's Day, so we were thankful that they took reservations.

They do request a 15 minute grace period to seat you after your set time, which was told to us when we called to reserve a table a few days prior. We arrived and checked in. We checked with the hostess at 3:45 and she reminded us of the grace period. We waited and waited...30 minutes later, we checked again and we're told we were coming up on the list. After another 20 minutes, we checked again only to be told they \"forgot\" about us and then seated us immediately.

The manager, Laura, came to the table to apologize for their mistake. She was the BEST! She was friendly, sincere, and assured us that she would take care of some of our bill due to their mistake. 

The waitress was great, food was beyond delicious, and even another manager stopped by the table to see if things were all good. We got the bill and our appetizer was taken off. We paid, tipped and left the restaurant.

We were in the parking lot when Laura chased us down to talk about our bill. She said it wasn't taken care of enough to make up for the inconvenience we experienced when we arrived. She voided the charge and gave us a great discount. We were shocked and so grateful for the exceptional customer service displayed by Laura and her staff. Thank you for making our Mother's Day dinner great!!"}
{"text":"Took the family (2 adults, kids:2,3, & 6). Ordered the big sample platter $35 i think, and it was enough for all of us. 2 different kinds of ribs, 2 different kinds of beef, and slow roasted chicken plus 3 different sides. The food was great. You could argue that other places make a single type of BBQ better but as a whole sample of BBQ, it doesn't get better than this. The portions of the side dishes could be bigger. We got there before 6pm and had no wait... once we left though, there were lot's of people waiting.

Their bar was rockin'. They have happy hour 'till 6p. Apparently this is the spot for drinks after work. Lot's of hot looking women. I will definitely be back, either with the family or with friends for the bar.

After reading the bad reviews I noticed a trend... they were written mostly by out-of-towner's that compare this place to joints in St. Louis and such. If you're some kind of a BBQ snob, of course you've had better... get over it. The BBQ is better than you're going to get at most full service restaurants that happen to have BBQ on the menu. As for those that complained about occasional bad service... have you seen the wait for a table after 6pm? Obviously they're doing something right. People have bad days sometimes."}
{"text":"First time at Bobby Qs! Four of us went for a birthday dinner last . We had the baby backs, sirloin steak and prime rib. Also baked potatoes, coleslaw and corn (buttery roasted corn shaved off the cob). And of course the corn bread and donuts. Everything was DELICIOUS! I was skeptical about getting the prime rib because at many places it can be really fatty and you end up not getting much meat. Not here! The waiter (Josh) assured me it was a lean cut of meat, and it was! Very tender and flavorful. The steaks were perfectly cooked and the ribs were tender with not too much sauce. (The ribs were not \"mush\" like other reviewers have said.) They also treated us to a piece of yummy banana cream pie as a birthday treat (the crust was thick and nutty) - tastefully presented with no annoying restaurant staff choir. It was very nice. 

All that being said, the outside of the building and the inside don't match. We used to go to Bobby McGees so I did sort of expect the old Bobby McGees atmosphere - with old bathtubs and mismatched furniture... it was a goofy, fun place back in the day. Now the interior is just nice. Not that that's bad. 

Oh, and we mentioned Yelp and got a 10% discount. :)"}
{"text":"THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE! The best everything and even the donuts they give you to go are amazing! A little pricey for some BBQ food but worth it, I just wish they'd give you a little more meat on the meat plates."}
{"text":"Food good, service good.   Annoying that there is a huge sign on the side of the building that has a giant spelling error. \"Catering for every occassion\"


Spelling errors show lack of attention to detail. 
Other than that, great restaurant."}
{"text":"After a 6 hour drive I was ready for some BBQ and yelp directed me to this spot a few miles from my hotel. I am somewhat critical when it comes to BBQ, having spent 8 years working for a Knoxville based company and then 2 years working for a Dallas based company, it is hard to beat those areas for pulled pork, baby back ribs and brisket respectively. 

I was pleased by most of what I ordered here at Bobby Q. The pulled pork was tasty, the sauce was agreeably flavorful, the baby backs were flavorful, although perhaps a little too tender, I did not have to pick them up to eat them, the meat fell off the bone. They were probably boiled to get this preparation, but they were yummy either way. The potato salad was exactly the kind I like in my BBQ joints. The mac and cheese side was just ok, not bad, but not the best thing on the plate. 

Overall it was a good meal for  BBQ west of the Mississippi and I would go again if in the area. Service was attentive, and the place itself was quite a nice spot to eat. Recommended."}
{"text":"I have been here on several trips to Phoenix. I usually order the brisket because it is about the best I have ever had.  This time I had the boneless fried chicken and it did not disappoint. Great service and great food. Don't miss out on this restaurant."}
{"text":"We are from KC. When we moved here we thought we would be without great BBQ. Then we found Bobby Q's. It's as good or better than anyplace in KC, delicious . Best meats any where!"}
{"text":"First time in the house. Staff was very welcoming and friendly. They even gave us a free order of the Q-Rolls (there was a mixup in the kitchen, so they gave them to us). 

The atmosphere is nice and comfortable with plenty of room between tables. There is even a small patio for cooler nights.

The food was good. I really enjoyed the Q-Roll stuffed with brisket and served with their chipotle sauce. I sensed that the portions would be large, so my partner and I shared the 2 rib entry (St Louis & Baby-back). The rancho beans had their own distinctive flavor without the beans being over-cooked. The same could be said of the steamed veggies. Corn bread is served with every meal and presented in a nice round Pattie; and it taste liked corn BREAD as opposed to cake.  My 4 star rating came because I felt that ribs were a little too salty.

The next time I come in I will still opt for ribs, maybe a steak. I may enjoy a cocktail with Q-Rolls as well."}
{"text":"Friendly welcoming atmosphere. Pulled pork was great. BBQ sauce was sweet but a little watery."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat some good barbeque. This place has been there for years. The staff is very nice and professional. Friday nights turn into a club and well you just can't go wrong.."}
{"text":"This place is just so racist, I can't deal with that manager and how he treats people who don't look like him."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for dinner 8/10/13. This was not our first time eating here and it will not be our last time either. We love the smokehouse burger, best burger ever. And the potato salad is amazing. With the suggestion of the awesome server (Sierra) that we had, I ventured to the mac n cheese as my side. WOW! That mac n cheese is so freaking creamy and cheesy, but it is not over kill either. I still nibbled on my husbands potato salad, but I am such a fan of it that I could not resist. They also have cornbread here before the meals, now I do not like cornbread so it did take me a couple visits of my husband telling me to try it before I actually did, and now I am mad that it took me so long and look forward to it every time!! 
The smokehouse burger is simply amazing! SO flavorful and juicy and deliciousness on a plate with bacon and cheese and BBQ sauce! LOTS of goodness all in one. 
We have never had a bad experience here, everyone is always in such a good mood and so willing to be a team and help each other so when I say that Sierra was simply wonderful, I am also complementing the entire staff :) 
Now for dessert....they bring out fresh house made (which everything here is house made) hot donuts! Save room because if you take them to go you are doing it wrong! YUM! I cannot wait to go back and eat there again."}
{"text":"Friendly, very fast service on a weekday night.
Quite decent cornbread (reference Houston's/Bandera's for the Benchmark cornbread!).
Good, tender pulled pork.
Grilled corn tasty, a bit greasy.
Grilled veggies fairly fresh, but meh.
Nice decor.
Overall, not bad a'tall.
Oink."}
{"text":"The beef brisket is awesome!!! Shay, our waitress made our dinner so fun!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. It was the first time, but I bet I will be going there again. The food was amazing and the server was very nice and attentive. The restaurant has the rustic country vibe, which totally is impressive. The menu had lots of options. And at the end of it all, u walk away with a bag of fried corn breads."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place.  It's not fine dining, but then it's BBQ.  Funky yet genuine decor with a touch of elegance here and there.  Very attentive staff.  We all had the Smokehouse burger since a burger was what were were after.  It was juicy and perfectly cooked with crunchy onions and bacon and cheese.  Pretty perfect when you want a heart stopper.  The waiter forgot to order our appetizer of onion block (or whatever they call it), which was a blessing since the burger was huge.  Still the manager showed up moments later to apologize for the oversight and offer us a free dessert.  I love those extra customer service touches.  If I lived in Phoenix, I'd go back here regularly."}
{"text":"Love this place always clean. I highly recommend this place and everything is very delicious. Best BBQ in town by far! I have been here more then once and every time is as good as the first time or even better."}
{"text":"Im about to go eat a burger right now. Excellent bbq.. but im in the mood for a burger. One of the best secrets about this place is the late night tacos!"}
{"text":"Amazing ribs the best I have ever had!  Delicious, great sauce. And I had a watermelon drink which was also delicious. Certainly a place to visit in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had the Pulled pork sandwich, amazing. Have been here two other times. Brought my wife and daughter. They were equally pleased. The waitress was top notch as well. I will be going back here often."}
{"text":"6 of us felt like bbq on Labor Day was an appropriate way to officially celebrate the end of our summer but didn't want to deal with the actual hassle of cooking.  Bobby Q hit the spot. We started with the hot wings--all drummettes--kind of standard hot wing fare. 

We all shared the \"whole hog\" platter which consisted of 2 slabs of ribs and 2 different bbq meats. They ran out of baby back ribs (booooo...) so we got the St. Louis ribs and the beef brisket and sliced bbq pork.  All very good stuff. The meat was tender and flavorful. I particularly liked the brisket. The waitress said that the \"whole hog\" would feed 3-4 people so we ordered the fried catfish as well.  I guess she meant 3-4 HUGE people, because it fed 6 of us and we still had leftovers (4 guys and 2 girls). The catfish was also good, not overcooked. We shared 4 sides: mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, grilled veggies, and roasted corn. The sides were quite satisfying, but not outstanding. 

We all ordered the fresh lemonade as a beverage--good but too sweet so I had ask for unsweetened ice tea to balance it out. Again, we were all too stuffed for dessert. 

Miss C and I agreed that we would definitely come back and take advantage of their happy hour specials--1/2 off margaritas, doubles for the price of singles, and 1/2 off apps--Tues-Fri from 4-8 pm."}
{"text":"Best all around bbq place in the city! Excellent service, very friendly wait staff, nice ambiance and great food! Love their mini donuts! Go here, won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"When you walk in it feels very welcoming. The staff there is wonderful. Our server was on top of everything they were very quick at refilling our drinks and getting us anything we asked for. The food came out really fast which was surprising. I was highly satisfied with the quantity and quality of our food . The bbq ribs are to die for! I live over an hour away from this place, but it's worth the drive !"}
{"text":"The restaurant lost our reservation but they made up for it by giving us the private room. We had a party of 10 and throughout the evening our waiter, Chandler, kept checking up on us and our drinks were never less than halfway empty. The food was amazing and the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Foods very average.....for the price wasn't worth my time. The atmosphere was nice but over all. Overage food for larger than needed prices."}
{"text":"This is a great casual restaurant that is fun for couples as it is as easy for families. Always has great drinks and barbecue. Must tries are the frozen banana dessert and rolled taco brisket appetizer!! Always a fun place, quick service and great food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a business lunch and it does not get any better. Was visiting town on business and the client suggested the venue. This joint hits on all cylinders. Greeted and seated promptly. Friendly but not intrusive server who was always there at the right time. Great corn bread to start. Had the BBQ chicken sandwich and shoestring fries. Delicious. Also, the five you a mini sugar donut made onsite with your bill. OMG best part of the meal. Leaves you with a great taste in your mouth. Pun perhaps intended or not ;)"}
{"text":"Great service and the manager actually stopped by
Get the steaks and ribs 
I haven't had better"}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday night. Waited 20 minutes to be seated. The atmosphere was killer and the server was very nice but my $35 steak that we waited 30 minutes for was WAY overcooked. They were also out of blue moon draft. I imagine I just caught them on a bad night  but I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here as our last meal before flying back home to SF and OH MY. She said it was the best meal of the trip and I had to agree. The meat was just fall-off-the-bone-oh-so-good!! The mac n cheese was good and goey, and full of cheese. I absolutely loved the fact that they gave us donuts after our meal and it was fresh because it was hot when given to us. Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the foods (baby back rip & St. Louis style ribs) and Q-rolls with nice treat of corn breads. 
Q-Lada was one of best drink I had. 
Plus the server was very nice and pleasant."}
{"text":"This place has a really great selection of BBQ. We tried a sampler and it was all very good. Portions are very big. We ate at the bar, but we were serviced by one of the best bartender/waitress that I have ever seen. Thanks Sarah! I will return on my next trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I love this spot. Great food fast service any desert you choose  will satisfy  your pallet the atmosphere  alone is super duper."}

Rotisserie chicken
Mashed potatoes
Baked potato
Pale Ale craft brew
Ambiance

Wish:
More craft beer selection (porters, stouts)"}
{"text":"You and your family should stop if you are looking for a quality meal.  Their BBQ brisket was the best I've ever had. Our server Jessica was very kind and attentive. At the end of the meal they gave us wonderful donuts."}
{"text":"Best bbq I have ever had and trust me I try a lot off bbq places. We were her for my sons baseball Junior Olympics and this place was recommended to us. We tried it the very last day and let me tell you, We will be going back every single time were in Arizona. We had the 49 dollars platter that came with 2 different types of ribs, chicken, tri tip and 2 sides. AMAZING!!!! the corn  bread is also the best and at the end they bring you this little donuts. This place is a must."}
{"text":"Bobby-Q had amazing food!!! We visited from San Francisco, Bay Area and this was wonderful. We ordered the q rolls for appetizer and it was delicious! The whole Hog Heaven is perfect for a family of four to five. All was good, but the St. Louis ribs were just a little too salty. We also found a hair in our mashed potatoes. However, the service is excellent and all the waiters are very amiable. In addition to the feast, they treated us with fresh donuts that were delicious. Overall, a 5-star amazing restaurant with top-notch food. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. It is literally barbecue heaven."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp because Pappadeaux's was packed and I wanted a Poboy! Our server Chelsea asked us if it was our first time there, and was excited to tell us they age their meats and slow cook them. My bf and I weren't sure what we wanted for an appetizer, so Chelsea recommended Q-pops. They were mouth watering beef brisket taquito type appetizers with BBQ sauce and chipotle sauce. The Mister ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich with Grilled Veggies and I got my Catfish Poboy with Potato Salad. Everything was so delicious!!! They also give you cornbread, which tasted sweet. I cannot wait to come back and try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"We came across this place while searching for a place open late on Sundays, and we're glad we did. The food was excellent, the service was hospitable, and the atmosphere was perfect. Will definitely make sure I return the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ in the Phoenix area. Q rolls are awesome and are waiter Garrett was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us great service."}
{"text":"Deeeee-licious!!!!  It's always a treat to come here and they never disappoint.  Their southern fried chicken is such a treat.  Their BBQ is amazing.  And even their salads are worth mentioning.  We take guests here often - ok only special guests - but they always leave satisfied and wanting to come back on their next visit.  Great service and usually always get a stop-by visit by the manager - evidence they care about their service and food!"}
{"text":"Being from the southeast. This is the best tasting I have found in Phoenix and west of the Mississippi. the meat is smoked just right and the portions are great."}
{"text":"Don't go there if you are vegetarian, but if you like meat, that's the place to be!!! I came for the weekend to play some golf. Found the place on Yelp and went there for dinner on Friday night. Went again for lunch on Sunday..:). The service was fast, good, even when the waitress forgot one item (maybe she didn't believe that we can eat that much...), still it was much better than other places.
I had the Cajun shrimps and prime rib on Friday. Sides: Corn and coleslaw. Was great. Sunday was even better: the three meat combo: Texas ribs, st. Louis ribs and beef brisket. Same sides. Didn't eat until Monday...So if you are in Phoenix and love smoke house don't miss it!!
And yes, clean restroom!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best barbecue I've ever had!  Brought my father here on his visit from Texas and he agreed.  My husband had the beef brisket and I had the pork and coleslaw sandwich so we could try both and both were amazing!  Will have to make this a new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"We were here on Friday and back again today love this place our server Garrett was on point"}
{"text":"Food excellent smoke house burger is my favorite sides of sweet potato fries & or macaroni & cheese save ur cholesterol counting for another day or place. Cheese cake for dessert"}
{"text":"Super busy at lunch time, but we had made a reservation. Food was really good but the mac and cheese is really rich, a bit too much. The BBQ was top notch and I would come back again."}
{"text":"This place is seriously just...AMAZING. The staff treats everyone with the utmost respect, everyone is extremely friendly, & the food is just magnificent. Seriously...just go. Just go there right now. Stop reading this & GO."}
{"text":"Good spot. Great appetizers.  Brisket was great.  A bit pricy.  The atmosphere is a bit confusing with a club attached...but once you get past that pretty good stuff here."}
{"text":"This place is a no brainer for BBQ!!! Food is always delicious and service is great . Every time I'm in town, I always make time for Bobby Q.."}
{"text":"Coming from the midwest, I was used to eating at many different bbq places.   There were a lot of mom and pop bbq joints.  Some great, some not.  So glad I tried bobby q.   Quality and very tasteful.   I have had  the brisket, sausage, and ribs.   All excellent.   Great ambiance.  Great service.   Great donuts to go.   Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ we have ever eaten. We got the big combo platter, and expected to like a couple of the options (you can choose up to 4), but we loved everything - beef ribs, brisket, pork, and St. Louis ribs. The Mac and Cheese was to die for, very cheesey, almost too cheesey. It was our first time there, so we were so pleasantly surprised when they handed us the WARM donuts as we paid the bill. Really delicious."}
{"text":"The best bbq restaurant I have ever been to.  The food and service provided was phenomenal.  I am a big fan of bbq and have tried it all, this was one of the best I have had.  We ordered the whole hog heaven to sample a little bit of everything.  It was delicious and cooked perfectly. We will definitely be a long time customer at this place."}
{"text":"I worked here for quite sometime... I can honestly say this is one of the cleanest, tastiest, and most affordable \"just past casual\" dining you will ever encounter. There is literally no bad item on the menu; however, I can honestly say the Smokehouse Burger, BBQ Brisket, and Mac and Cheese outdoes the rest of the menu. The atmosphere can be a little dark, but creates a more private experience. Service is some of the best I have ever encountered."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.

This place has THE BEST ribs I've ever had. I really popped in here on a whim and was blown away by the food. I went on a Sunday and got $10 off the sharing platter. This place has the nicest cornbread muffins too, but really everything is delicious. I went to grab the half-rack of ribs and the bones just fell out of the meat. At the half-way point I had to stop myself because I'd end up pigging out. I got the rest to go but honestly this was the best cue I had in all of the USA."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Our server was the best. I believe her name is Alexis. Wish we lived closer, we would be here more oven."}
{"text":"Every single time I come here, it's a fantastic experience. My boyfriend and I make it a point to take our family and friends here when they come to visit Phoenix. The venue is so charming and the staff is always friendly. If you have any issues, they are always very quick to make it right. Plus, their food is out of this world! The Q rolls are a perfect appetizer and their meats are great! Definitely a must try if you're visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"There's Famous BBQ, and there are Pit's along with several other places coworkers and the like have dragged me to. Let's face it, when it comes to BBQ everyone has a different take, and I don't like the overly sweet, globs of sauce thrown on at the last minute, in spite of claims it been smoked for hours. I'm not that big on loud country music and I don't want to go to a Ho- Down. I'm hungry; I want real ribs with meat on the bone. Good portions, albeit, I'll order the full rack of St Louis style ribs next time. The Rib's here do fall off the bone; they have a sultry smoky flavor. Corn Bread that is probably the best you can get and Beans, we'll I might work on those, but I come for the Ribs. Bobby Q is easy to see with its big sign visible from I-17, but might not be the easiest to find the first time, once you drive into the private parking area, I feel better. Safer, it's good to read there is security, but I haven't noticed them. Then again, I go for dinner.
This is the only Rib place that makes my mouth water; the Rib's are deeply smoked and taste like someone cared because they have a passion for RIbs. The service has been just right, every time I've been there, and not too long waiting for the check. I don't mind spending time in a restaurant, but when the plate is clean I like to go. My wife can have her BBQ Chicken, but I'm there for the Ribs. Other places, I'll think about and might eat, but these are the only Ribs in Phoenix that I won't say no to or have reservations about."}
{"text":"We tried this place a couple of weeks ago and were very impressed.  It's probably the best BBQ we've had in Arizona for sure and maybe one of our favorites of all time.  The sauce is excellent, the meat is tender and full of smoky bbq flavor.  We had the Sunday special which came with lots of different types of meats like pulled pork, ribs, brisket and chicken.  It was excellent.  The side of corn was tasty too as were all the sides.  This will be one of our new frequent places to eat!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the world!  Great food, great service!  Try the the q-rolls!"}
{"text":"Our office gets Bobby Q's catering for meetings, and everyone loves it. The barbecue is great. My favorite is their yummy macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"My hubby & I aren't the biggest BBQ fans but Bobby Q is definitely a fav of ours! I have been here a few times for lunch with my dad & the engineering company I used to work for would always order it in for lunch meetings. Last night I wasn't in the mood to cook dinner so I called in a to go order & used my $50 gc I got for my bday, thx bro!

I ordered the following for the Mr. & I: q-rolls (app), smokehouse burger (no bbq sauce-add mustard) with shoestring fries, half rack of back baby ribs with mac & cheese & potato salad & for dessert their homemade mud pie. Oh & it also came with 4 pieces of cornbread & I bought a bottle of their BBQ sauce. 

The q-rolls were so freakin good, the chipotle dip that comes with is delish! My hubs said his burger was just ok but loved the fries. My ribs were fall off the bone tender & the mac & cheese was yummy. I didn't have room for the potato salad, but I've had it before & it's always good. I have to say their cornbread is so amazing, possibly the best I've ever had! The mud pie was just ok, the cookie crust had a weird taste & they used vanilla & chocolate ice cream, I prefer it with mocha. My hubby however, thought it was very good. 

We'll definitely be back whenever we have a craving for some delicious BBQ!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get the Catfish Poboy because it is so yummy! Their BBQ is so tender and the meat just falls off the bone. I never liked corn bread until I had theirs! It is so buttery and soft. Yum!"}
{"text":"Eh, brisket was dry till i soaked it in bbq sauce which was pretty good, if you are going to recommend a dish it should be good not dry and chalky.  Service was good, place was nice, especially the outside patio, shudda had the steak"}
{"text":"Great service and absolutely delicious food & BBQ all around.  Already looking forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eating here for years and it is absolutely the best BBQ in town!  We have taken several friends and family there and the staff and management are top notch.  Don't waste your money anywhere else Bobby Q's is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"BEST RIBS I HAVE EVER HAD! No joke. The amount of ribs you get for the price is insane. They also give you free donuts at the end as a go home treat. And those things are like crack to me. You MUST eat here if you love BBQ and live near phoenix."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Phoenix. I LOVE it so much. It is a bit pricey, but the food is fantastic and the servers are great. Their happy hour is actually pretty good as well. I've tried several drinks and never been disappointed. The environment is so unique and fun. After you've eaten more than you can handle they also give you free donuts! Amazing place."}
{"text":"OH my is all I have to say!  The food here was the best!  If I lived in Phoenix I would be in trouble cause I would be here all the time!  Wait staff was friendly also."}
{"text":"Costs were acceptable even minus the reduction, but it did give me incentive to drive a bit further than I normally would for dinner. OH WHO AM I KIDDING, I was going to attempt this area anyways. I adore BBQ, and Bobby Q's does it right! My son discovered the sausage to be overly hot, but they did warn us when he purchased, so he ended up eating my meal and I took his. Extremely great things all around... BBQ beans were great, the cornbread was wonderful and did not fally to bits like it did at Thee Pitts Again, and service was spot on. Definitely worth a return trip!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had. Amazing appetizer! Strongly recommend the Q Rolls!!! Also the meal was fantastic. The sauce was the perfect and sweet. Also to top it off they give amazing donuts at the end. I don't have one complaint."}
{"text":"VERY good food at reasonable prices.  We had a large party so we made a reservation.  The waitress was agreeable to dividing up the checks.  Menu large and varied, but not overwhelming.  Great drinks, too!  I recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Great food and great service, Jessica, our waitress was especially efficient, friendly and helpful. Loved the pork sandwich .. One thing esp nice was the patio. It's nice to be outside without car and road noise. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bobby Q is my favorite place and they came through for me as usual. They have delicious food, great service and delicious food. Did I mention the delicious food?!  I love Bobby Q!  By the way, they also have a great happy hour that includes a dance floor and food!"}
{"text":"I am a Phoenix local and pass Bobby Q just about everyday in my way to work and think that I should stop for a bite sometime. Well, I finally did and it was AMAZING! I went with some coworkers of mine and the service was extraordinary! I was a little nervous when we showed up and there was a full parking lot but it took no time at all until we had our lunches relieved to our table. I would highly recommend the Q rolls, they were so good! They also have great lunch specials! The cornbread and donuts they give you too at the beginning and end of the meal is fantastic. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My husband & I were visiting from out of town. This restaurant was next to our hotel. The sign outside said \"voted best in U.S.\" which peaked our interest. We love BBQ! We asked the front desk clerk about it & she said it was so good that she would recommend that we make a reservation because it was always so busy. We made our reservation & got there 15 minutes early & were seated by our reservation time. Everyone was extremely friendly! Our server, Justin, was polite & attentive. We ordered the giant platter that came with 4 choices of meat, a half pound each, & 3 sides. We ended up with the brisket, pulled pork, beef ribs & St. Louis ribs. Our sides were potato salad, pecan coleslaw & vegetables. Everything was delicious! My favorite was the brisket. The pulled pork literally melted in our mouths! The ribs were good but not the best I've had. The sides were delicious as well. The ambiance was very rustic & causal, just my kind of place! Prices were reasonable for what we got. The platter, a beer & glass of wine came to $66 after tax AND we had leftovers. Next time we visit Phoenix we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great place if your looking for some good ol' comfort food. The ambience is fun. The cornbread is really good. Good enough for the wife to forget about her so called diet. If your debating on coming here stop it just get your butt in here! I always try different items on the menu and so far I haven't been disappointed"}
{"text":"I have absolutely no idea how this place has so many great reviews. We were in the mood for bbq one recent Saturday night and the place we wanted to try only stayed open until 7, so we found this place on yelp and decided with so many great reviews, we should give it a try. 

Let's just say the cornbread was the highlight of the meal and I've had better cornbread. We ordered the Three Meat Combo and chose the St. Louis Style Ribs (they were out of the Baby Back Ribs), the brisket and the pulled pork. For our sides, we got the mac & cheese and the ranch style beans. The beans were good and the ribs were just ok. The mac & cheese was definitely not up to par. The brisket had so much fat on it, it wasn't even edible and I had to drown the pulled pork in bbq sauce to eat it.

Minutes after we were given our food, they asked if we wanted boxes, and then came back a few minutes later and did the same thing. Not good service. Also - I was excited about the free mini donuts they give you to go. But - they're so bad, they're not even worth eating.

Pretty sure we won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Well I was very excited to try this place based off of reviews and recommendations from friends. All I can say is meh. The food was extremely bland from the cornbread to the cloe slaw and even every meat on the sampler platter everything lacked any kind of flavor. This was extremely suppressing based on all of the raving reviews this place has. Maybe the cooks had an off day. There were two exceptions though the Mac and cheese was hands down the best I have ever had at a BBQ place and the Q rolls were amazing. Service was okay, but there was one thing that really made me uneasy about the place while eating I was watching the bar back cutting limes. First he wasn't wearing any gloves which is gross seeing that those limes go straight into drinks. But he then cut himself on the slicer, I could tell by his expression, he looked down at the cut and then continued to slice more limes. This really disgusted me so I decided to tell a manager. She came right But when I told her what had happened I really felt like she could care less. When we were finished talking she didn't even go remove the limes from the bar but went off to do something else. The food was definitly a dissapointment especially for the $50 price tag but again everyone has an off day, but I definitely won't be back because of what I witnessed and how little was done to fix it."}
{"text":"I'm giving Bobby Q an extra star in this update to my previous review, because although it has its share of hits and misses, it is, in fact, as good as it gets in Phoenix for great barbecue. I love barbecue. It is a hobby of mine. When I get stuck on something and want to know what it should look and taste like, I go to Bobby Q and am almost never disappointed. Most recently, this happened with beef brisket. I'm going to upload a picture I took of Bobby Q's brisket because seriously, if you look at it and don't want to immediately die from desire, then you just don't like barbecue. If I had anything bad at all to say about Bobby Q, it would be that sometimes their meats can be slightly overdone but this is not the norm. Their quality control, considering how much food they must serve to keep up with the demand, is astounding.  Their prices are too high, but of course, you're paying for the almost Disney-esque atmosphere. Their sauce is absolutely delicious (although it should be noted: they don't understand what \"spicy\" means). All in all I really can't say enough good things about this place. Go look at my brisket photo. Seriously."}
{"text":"I got the tasting platter (or whatever it's called for $13) and chose the Pork, Ribs and Brisket with a side of pecan slaw.

I didn't expect a feast, and wasn't disappointed. the portions were what one would expect from a tasting platter: 4 or so small ribs, several forkfuls of pulled pork and 3-4 pieces of brisket. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the slaw. That thing had me pleasantly chowing down for more time than any of the meats I chose. 

How was the meat: the pulled pork was EXCELLENT. It was tender, juicy, and had just the right amount of BBQ sauce. The brisket was a bit on the lean side, but had enough help from the great house BBQ sauce to push that one through. When you got brisket that had a bit more fat to it, it would just melt in your mouth (that's the way brisket should be!). The ribs (St. Louis-style) were as good as everyone on here hypes them: the meat can be pulled off the bone with little to no effort. I don't recall how smokey the ribs were, but I liked them regardless and noted that the house wasn't trying to use rib-meat as a thinly-veiled vehicle for BBQ. The ribs were lightly sauced, and the strength of the preparation was, in no way, not masked by said sauce.

For dessert, my table order a 1/2 order of the banana pudding, and a full order of the mud-pie. We *loved* the banana pudding (it's more like a banana custard atop a pecan-crumb crust), but couldn't find it in ourselves to enjoy the mud-pie. Our waitress was gracious enough to take the pie back and bring us a full order of banana pudding! What a gal!

Simply put: if I'm back in/around Phoenix and am craving BBQ, I will not hesitate to come back here and get either a pulled pork sandwich or a full rack of ribs."}
{"text":"We have dined here at least 15 times, since we eat out at least 4 times per week. We have not been back in over 2 years, due to issue below:
The Good:
-Servers
-Brisket
-Ribs
-Salmon
-Shrimp
-Cornbread (love the corn kernals...please add a few more?)
-Cole slaw (PLEASE add a few more pecans!)

The Bad:
-Pulled Pork (for years it tastes like natural gas grill--sorry, but that's accurate and I am a paid \"taster\")

The Ugly:
-We have not been back, since one visit, our Guest who bought us drinks while standing around waiting for a table was highly over-charged for cocktails!  
Charged $14.00 for a glass of St. Michel Reisling ($7 to $8. for a bottle at any super market)  Also charged $14. for a well-drink and $9. for a bottle of Bud Light!
We should have asked for the manager right at the moment, but as good restaurant goers, we let it go in a busy environment.  

I phoned a few days later to be treated very poorly and found that \" I must be mistaken\"
I have phoned about a year later (because I would like to go back but my partner will not) and the prices were lower than we paid that night.
Perhaps this was a dishonest bartender, taking advantage or perhaps prices have since been reduced.
Nevertheless...with an issue like this, you would THINK that someone would care enough to at least be courteous, let alone offer compensation...although, we never usually accept compensation. 
However...Bobby Q's doesn;t care...they are busy enough.

Oh well...I miss the place...but RoadHouse at Metrocenter just a mile away, gets all of our BBQ  business now."}

{"text":"Had the pulled pork, brisket and ribs. Their meat is slow smoked so it's very tender and very good. Nice atmosphere and great service also!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! The food is so good! It was freakin' delicious. We had the hog heaven with St. Louis, chicken, brisket, and baby back with three sides. OMG it was incredibly juicy and tender and tasty. They offered us different sauces. We went with the Carolina sauce. 

And the service was spot on. Everyone greeted us and was super friendly. These folks know \"customer service\". They made you feel like they're so happy you chose to come to their place."}
{"text":"Bobby Q is now at 32nd St and Camelback in the Safeway Plaza! This is by far the BEST BBQ IN THE ARCADIA\BILTMORE area!!!! The BRISKET literally melts in your mouth and no need for a knife it's so tender!! So far I've also had the prime rib and ribs and they were EXCELLENT! The servers are friendly and super attentive. Come in and Bob may be there to personally greet you and welcome you to BBQ heaven!!! I LOVE GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE!!!!"}
{"text":"Not only does this place offer life changing BBQ... The service is always top of the line! They even give you a fresh doughnut with your check. 

Only Downside: There are a few tables with crazy bright lights. They need to dim those puppies!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! The food really is great and the atmosphere is so fun. We tried the catfish, salmon, roasted chicken and the pulled chicken sandwich. Everything was excellent, maybe the salmon just so-so. The service was OK. Don't order dessert! Free homemade donuts for everyone!! Free cornbread as a starter, too."}
{"text":"Ordered for Thanksgiving to supplement our traditional meals. Stood in line for about 45 minutes but so worth it! Mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, beans = yummy! Definitely will visit again!"}
{"text":"Don't come in parties of 7 I had to wait an hour while parties of 3 to 4 were being seated ahead. If they can seat small parties put tables together obvious solution."}
{"text":"Great wood fire grilled sirloin steak and loaded baked potato, sat at the bar and the staff was very accommodating and attentive. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ places I have ever been to.  The baby back rib meat falls off the bone.  The sides were tasty as well.  Be hungry when you come, but be prepared to wait a bit if you didn't make a reservation."}
{"text":"Delicious barbecue, we had 4 meats platter that we split with three people.  The pulled chicken is amazing, the brisket tender and juicy, the ribs succulent and flavorful, best barbecue around.  The sides were delicious as well, mac & cheese was great, mashed potatoes did not disappoint, ranch beans aren't anything special but they tasted good.  

Service was great, waiter was attentive to our needs and accommodated a last minute switch after already putting in the order. Atmosphere is good, not too noisy/quiet, the lighting could be improved though, a single bulb above the table barely allows you to see what you are eating, though the food wasn't there long enough to be seen:)

Highly recommended to someone looking for great barbecue ribs, chicken, brisket, etc."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Make sure to wear stretchy pants because you will walk out of this restaurant 10 pounds heavier. One of the best BBQ places I've ever tried. I highly suggest making a reservation because it can get busy in there. I've gone with friends and we share the \"Whole Hog Heaven\" which gives you the opportunity to try 4 different meats on their menu plus 3 sides. But the best part is defitnitely their bbq sauce so make sure to ask for extra because they will gladly give it to you! Their roasted corn is my favorite side dish and the mac and cheese is really good too. 

Also, try the Q-rolls as a starter. The chipotle dip is delicious! And make sure to get an order of the cornbread too..you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"First time there tonight. Great quality food and attentive service. Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"I didn't try their food but the drinks did not dissapoint! We definitely had fun, the music was great and the staff was on top of it! As far as price goes I do think its reasonable compared to other places we have been to!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place before. I'll keep it short... food, atmosphere, service, all awesome. If you like BBQ or steaks, definitely hit this place. Just don't do it on a night I'm going, sometimes it gets very busy. :D"}
{"text":"If you're in the Phoenix area definitely make this a must have dinner trip! We had to wait no time at all and were seated very quickly. Our server was Nicole and she was literally the best server we have ever had. She made sure we were attended to and had a great personable conversation with us. The food was amazing as well. We had the pulled pork sandwich and the BBQ chicken sandwich which were both perfect. We are from the east coast towards the south so we have had our fair share of BBQ and this was by far the best we've had. The mac and cheese was great and we both got it as our side. For dessert we got the death by chocolate which once again was amazing. To top it all off they brought us little donuts as an end of the meal treat and they were so good we had to force them down as we were so full but they were just so amazing! We were checked on once again by two gentlemen who were hosting and both were amazing and made sure or experience was good. Both were extremely personable. Overall an amazing establishment and made our trip to Phoenix even better! We will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Bobby Q did not disappoint. Our server and the manager blew us away with their amazing service!!"}
{"text":"I was very satisfied with food and service. Their burgers are amazingly good. They served corn bread when we got seated and it was very good."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and so happy I did! We're from California so we wanted to find a local place to eat. Delicious food, fun environment, and great service. The manager came to each table to say hi and to make sure everything was great. Coming back here tonight to bring my sister and her friends before heading back to California. A must try! Q rolls were yummy. Complimentary corn bread was delicious. Prime rib and ribs we ordered were so tender. Can't go wrong with any of the sides. All were tasty. Fresh hot Donuts are a nice treat at the end too! A+ in my book!!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Bobby Q's, tonight, as always the food was amazing, especially the mac and cheese and I must say our waiter DEAN was awesome! He explained all the specials offered suggestions and when our food was served made sure to check and see that it was cooked to order, which it was! Definitely recommend Bobby Q's, great atmosphere, great food and great staff!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and came in here for lunch and to watch some football on a Sunday. We ordered the Q Rolls to start which were delicious and then out came the cornbread which was amazing! Then my pulled pork sandwich came out with coleslaw. I requested the spicy BBQ sauce and while the taste was great, it literally had no spicy-ness to it. The coleslaw was okay; it didn't really have any flavor. We also ordered the ribs and they were very good. They were meaty and it fell right off the bone. Then as we were leaving we got a to go bag of yummy, cinnamon sugar, mini donuts! I thought that was a really nice touch. I would definitely recommend this place and if I'm ever back in town, I will go back."}
{"text":"My first review! I felt obliged to sign up (and do this), since I found Bobby Q via Yelp (tonight) in the first place. We enjoyed ribs and pulled pork, the food was just right. Not Memphis mastery, but a solid effort. The BBQ sauce was especially good--all our sides were fresh (especially the pecan cole slaw, which can easily get \"soft\" by 10pm depending on the establishment. They started the meal with good (sweet) cornbread. Overall nice and clean atmosphere--the manager asked if we were okay several times. We got free tiny cinammon donuts at the end, a nice touch-. I left stuffed, $40 even (without tip) for two. Note that they provide a 10% Yelp discount--smart choice, I wish them the best."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, great food! I love BBQ and I very impressed... I would highly recommend Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"Eat here all the time!  Favorites include BRISKET!!!

Try the Loaded Potato, Meatloaf Special on Thursdays (a little spicy), BBQ Chicken Sandwich is a great option.  Mashed potato and Mac/Cheese are best sides.

Looking for the lighter side, the Avocado Salad with BBQ Vinagrette is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Better than Dillon, better than famous Dave's. The best barbeque."}
{"text":"If your a true BBQ lOVER as I am this is the one to visit! I've had the ribs, pulled pork, and brisket and it's all good. I've drive out of my way and don't mind passing other by on the way. A little pricey but we'll worth it, I'll definitely be back again and again two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Amazing. Service almost makes me wonder if they've been professionally trained, they're so efficient and attentive. Starting cornbread was surprisingly moist and tasty, and main meal sides all had just that one extra touch to make it better than average (ex. pecans with the traditional cole slaw, extra garnish on potato salad), with the roasted corn especially good. Steak, chicken, and shrimp were delicious (steak especially so, best I've had in a while). We came in less than an hour before the restaurant closed and service and quality of food didn't drop at all. A great restaurant experience and would recommend."}
{"text":"Tried their pulled pork and chicken at Scottsdale BBQ festival and decided to go to their restaurant. Still think that chicken was the best and the ribs coming as close 2nd. Don't think the pullpork was that good - a little dry when we have it. The beef brisket was average."}
{"text":"One of my favorite (actually only American dish I like :) Barbecue. Bobby Q - is so good. sometimes you have to wait for 20 - 30 mins in peak hours but you can hang out at a bar until you get your table or eat at the bar. Food is so good. Never failed taste  - always busy even though it is in old housing neighborhood. Service is excellent - manager always comes around to ask for taste of food and service. Very well manged and you can taste good old Barbecue. Deserts are good too. Sunday special is something you want to try if you have four people."}
{"text":"Bobby Q has the best bbq food. It will not disappoint you.

It is in a tricky location and is somewhat confusing to get to, but, when you get there, there is plenty of parking and the food is so good. The mac and cheese, potato soup, mash potatoes, ribs, salmon, and bbq hamburger are my favorites.. 

The place is pretty dark inside and it has a nice dinner atmosphere.

If you haven't tried Bobby Q's and you are in the mood for some real slow cooked bbq, give Bobby Q's a try."}
{"text":"My wife, son (7) and I went to lunch here during a weekday. It was busy but not crowded and we were able to get a table right away. The waitress we had was excellent, she was knowledgeable, very attentive but not annoyingly so. I got pulled pork platter and my wife got the pulled pork sandwich. Both of these were excellent. The portions were a good size, and the corn bread was very good as well. My wife ordered the lemonade to drink, which she said was great and couldn't get enough of. My son ordered the cheeseburger and was not too impressed, although he is a picky eater sometimes. Also, when leaving, they give you a couple of mini sugar doughnuts as a treat that they make fresh at the front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Have been back two time since. This place is just amazing. Service is always way above and beyond. This time Riley was our server and he did an amazing job. Portions are always good, flavors are amazing, and service is prompt and non-intrusive. What more could you want from a restaurant?"}
{"text":"Wow this BBQ is the best!!! I had searched for this place on the Internet because I had been here years ago and it was a themed restaurant  .....Bobby McGees where the wait staff was dressed in character. When we arrived we were told that they quit doing that 8 yrs ago ;( They told us we would not be sorry if we stayed and they were right. It was by far the best BBQ ever!! Melted in your mouth. I told them I was looking on yelp to see if others loved them too and that they did!!! Then our excellent friendly server told us we got 10% off for mentioning yelp!! Wooo hoo icing on the cake."}
{"text":"My office tends to go here often for lunch. I have gotten the fish all every  time i have been there. The fish is fabulous. It is a different type of batter than you usually get. The fries that come with it are the shoe string type and quite good. The table gets corn bread which is my favorite. I might just only eat the corn bread next time. 

On occasion, the wait staff has not been as prompt as I normally care for. I waited almost 15 minutes once for vinegar for the fish and chips. Sometimes they are slow to refill drinks. It is usually when it is a small party that I have had slower service."}
{"text":"What a great BBQ, and more restaurant. The food is fantastic, the service outstanding, and yes, the desserts are to die for. This is a great lunch or dinner spot and we really enjoy meeting friends for a meal."}
{"text":"Took previous reviews and had the Brisket sandwich... Very good! Beans- loved them!! Corn bread yummy as well. Alicia our server was so sweet, friendly and accommodating! Definite place to visit again"}
{"text":"This food here is soooooooo good.  The Q-rolls are my favorite, and I love the cornbread.  We eat here at least once every 6 months, and the pulled pork is just so delicious, last night I felt like a whole pig was on my sandwich (I certainly felt like a pig after devouring every scrap of it).  That made me very happy because even though it was really too much food, the last 2 times we ate here the portion was much smaller.

We had really wonderful service (Zac) and there was a table having a party that just kept growing (I think eventually 18 people arrived) and no service suffered because of it so bravo to everyone for being able to handle a full restaurant and a huge group of people while not ignoring the rest of the patrons."}
{"text":"I am not a bit BBQ fan but this place is fantastic! I didnt want to go here but my friends talked me into it. I am very surpised that I loved the food. The whole place smells amazing. Everything I have ever ate here tastes delicious. They even give you little donuts before you leave. 
Friday nights they have a buffet and a DJ and music to dance to for happy hour."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas where the B-B-Q is the best .Bobby-Q  rates on top with the best  B-B-Q  in Texas .Yeah ,Way to go ,and the Staff is excellent .Thanks for a great evening. Linda"}
{"text":"Food and service, xlnt.  Eat here."}
{"text":"This place has amazing cornbread, I'd go just for that. In fact, you should go at least once just to try it. 

Service was really slow and unattentive, but it's a popular place so that was expected. I got the ribs but they didn't even come off the bone that easily. it was obvious they were cooked fast, not a proper slow and low. We had a few sides to sample, but they werent anything to note. 

It's a fun, lively place but I won't be making a habit of it as there's better rib options out there."}
{"text":"Coming from Florida with a lack of everything, this is outstanding BBQ and our service was great too!  No complaints. First visit and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. This was not the first time they put in the small beef rib in this meal namely jumbo texas beef rib. This meal cost $27 before tax which was supposed to contain 4 jumbo beef ribs. But they put in this small size of beef rib which caused the dish was not value for money that we paid. This is not the first time. I will stop buying from this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've driven by this spot so many times on the 17 and finally decided to look it up on yelp.  Based on the mostly rave reviews my boyfriend and I decided to give it a shot.

First off I was really excited about the mac n cheese since so many people said it was amazing.  I was severely disappointed and agree with another reviewer who said it tasted like velveeta.  I'm convinced that's exactly what it was.  The beans tasted like watered down canned baked beans.  Okay, now that the bad is out of the way let me tell you about the good.

We ordered the Q rolls as recommended and we weren't disappointed.  Both sauces were tasty.  We couldn't decide on what to get so we went with hog heaven to try a bit of everything.  We chose the St. Louis ribs, the beef ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  Our sides were mac n cheese, beans, and roasted corn.  We had to ask for cornbread.

The cornbread was good, on the caky side but still good.  The roasted corn was very good, I recommend it.  The brisket and pulled pork were definitely up to par.  I grew up on both.  They weren't quite my dad's, but still worthy of recommendation.  Both ribs were fall off the bone.  I hadn't has St. Louis ribs before and I wont get them again.  They were on the spicy side, which I personally don't prefer.  The beef ribs were very tasty and I would order them again.

After waiting for some boxes we started to look around at the other tables.  The baked potatoes look awesome, stuffed to the hilt of goodness.  They also had vegetables.  No mac n cheese or beans in sight.  We'll definitely follow suit next time.

All in all we were pleased with the experience.  The main food was done right and the restaurant and atmosphere was great.  The service was definitely to our liking.  The 10% off from yelp was also a bonus :)

We are both huge fans of honey bears and their sauce, although as of late the ribs haven't been fall off the bone.  We are considering buying honey bears' sauce and getting Bobby Q's beef ribs to go without the sauce."}
{"text":"We drove 30 min to B.Q. this past Saturday evening 7:30ish our first visit.The place was jumping & we were starving we happily gave our name to the young hostess and asked how long does she think it will be - about an hour & a half - ok. So we left and got a quick snack to hold us over down the street . We returned  30 min later & the place was half empty  with the same hostess at the front had called us twice. Where did 1 1/2  hour wait go? No big deal.

So by this time we forgo the dinner idea and ordered  cocktails and a couple brisket sandwiches along with the sides. \"\" WOW\"  Wheres the beef ?  It sure wasn't on our table it looked more like an empty Mcdonalds bun. The sides were good along with the tad of beef. Table service was A+ and triple A+  to the nicest lady flr mgr who was working hard helping out on the tables...... Sweet idea with the donuts...
 
Big disappointment - over $40.00 bucks &  no beef.  Sorry for the ding."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight for the first time in a few years and it was just fantastic. Our server Jonah was super helpful with all of our questions and made the night great! We ordered the Hog Heaven to split and it was amazing. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Hands down. AMAZING BBQ. Dinner started with delicious cornbread. Then we split the combo platter which was very large for $13 and had ribs, brisket, pulled pork, corn and the nice waitress even brought us out some cole slaw and Mac and cheese to try. Delicious!!!  The waitress was extraordinary. I saw drinks being brought out in real pineapples. At the end they even bring you out a bag of hot fresh donuts. This place is YOWZA good. Total bill was a measly $15. LOVE!"}
{"text":"What can I say that you don't know about this place? It's been reviewed over 50 times...  I had been dying to try it as I love a great pulled pork sandwich and everyone was telling me how great they were here!

Well, I was not disappointed.  The pork was tender with great flavor, overflowing off the bun, creating a sticky BBQ mess (which is just the way I like it!) I went for the ranch beans instead of the fries, and while you don't get a lot, they were very good.  I skipped the corn bread and little dessert donuts (didn't need the carbs) but everyone else loved them. 

I'm still looking for the best BBQ pulled pork sandwich in Phoenix, but this is the leader so far!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday (first time) for lunch. We had 4 people and we all LOVED our selections plus the appetizer we shared!!!
The server, Sam, was great; ambiance wonderful and the food was fabulous!!!
Excellent experience - we'll go back for sure"}
{"text":"Best barbecue in phoenix! Love the brisket oh man the prime rib is so tender just like the ribs they practically fall off the bone. Did I mention the roasted veggies potatoe salad chicken wings I could go on and on about this place but you gotta check it out for yourself I know I will  be back."}
{"text":"My family went here on a trip up to Flagstaff and are now ruined on barbeque. The prices were very reasonable, the portions big, the flavors fantastic, and the draft beers thirst-quenching. I don't think I'll ever have ribs that good again. Our server and the bartender were very attentive. If you must go here, be sure to mention Yelp for 10% off your order. We had the Whole Hog Heaven ($38) and Q-Rolls ($9), which were more than enough for four people. The Amber Ale, available in 21 oz glasses, is a good pairing. The ambiance is noticeably better than Chilli's, but not pretentious. Stopping here was a highlight of our trip."}
{"text":"Wow what a pleasant surprise this place was. The food was great, and the service was outstanding.
4 stars for the restaurant. I would go back again.


The bar in the back was a little weird of a set up, the rules were hilarious, I thought it was a joke at first, but no, it  made you wonder what kind of clientele they dealt with. The service was good. I didn't care for the vibe in bar though..left after one drink.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The only complaint about this place is I will never be able to eat ribs anywhere else again and be happy. Nirvana for smoked meat. We loved it!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! My wife and I were pleasantly surprised with this hidden gem. Ordered a combination plate...hog something. Two ribs, two meats, and three sides. Meat was so tender it melted in your mouth. WOW! 

If your ever in Phoenix stop by and have a the best meal experience ever! Price and food portions were perfect! Service was great everyone made sure that you were taken care of...trust me if you want a great meal come and get it! 

We're from California and would definitely stop in again while passing through.

Great job!

Brisket, pulled pork, St. Louis ribs, beef ribs, pea can coleslaw, potato salad and veggies."}
{"text":"There is good and bad in my review. Ultimately I do not regret going here but I feel obliged to pass on the whole story.

So we were going to be in Phoenix for a few days for my son's birthday. Bobby Q was one of the restaurants that came up as a recommended place to eat. I was told when I looked them up on Urban Spoon that if I mention them that I would get 10% off, so I figure \"hey why not?\" I mention it to the waitress when we arrive and when we get our bill and nothing was done. Though 7 or 8 bucks really won't make or break me, if they think coming out a few bucks ahead is worth having that advertised on a site like this then I simply think that's a foolish way to conduct business - draw people in with a deal and then back out on it. That being said I did like the food there. It wasn't the cheapest meal but it also wasn't outrageous (I think about 70-80 for my wife, son, and I). We went with the one offer that was like $40 for a couple of different types of ribs, sides, and other meat products. We were honestly quite full and agreed our health would take a major hit if we were to eat like that on a regular basis. Pretty cool décor in the place. I'd rate it higher but it does bug me with their false offers. Honour it or take it down. If you go in with that knowledge you'll probably more or less enjoy your dining experience."}
{"text":"The smoke house wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Q rolls a must have, and the brisket was too die for."}
{"text":"This is my reliable date night restaurant especially when in the mood for good BBQ. Experiences have always been fantastic that have led my fiancé and I will be to book Bobby Qs for our rehearsal dinner. 

Considering our last visit and how busy it was our waitress Ashlynn was incredibly hospitable and everything exceeded our already high expectations."}
{"text":"Got in late from California Sunday night and went straight to Bobby Q's.  Had the prime rib/catfish combo.  The menu said it could feed two and it was right on!  My husband is healthy, so he ordered veggies for sides -- I was craving the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes I saw going to another table.  Anyway, the manager came over and knew we were tired and just wanted to eat and go, so he threw in a dessert -- anything we wanted!!!  I got the apple cobbler and good thing I got it to go because had I known it was that good, I would have ordered 2 so I wouldn't have to share with my husband.  I will definitely be going back when I return to Phoenix."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Bobby Q's last night for the first time because a friend recommended them.  We chose to sit on the patio which was a great choice as we had a pretty quiet meal. The mister's and the fans kept the area nice and cool even though it was close to 110 out.

We were promptly greeted by one of the best waitresses I've ever had the pleasure to be served by. She did her best trying to gently upsell us as is expected at restaurants these days, though she was far from being pushy. 

The food was a little expensive in my opinion which is the reason for the 4 stars, though I probably would have gone 4 and a half because it truly was some of the best barbecue you could have.  Not a long wait either! 

All in all it was a great experience, but as a warning, try and beat the dinner rush or you'll end up waiting for a long time. It's a pretty popular place."}
{"text":"This is some seriously good barbecue.  I had the two meat platter and I chose baby back ribs and chicken.  My sides were mac and cheese and ranch beans.  The ribs were meaty and fall-off-the-bone tender, slathered in a tangy sauce.  They were pretty impressive.  I love smoked chicken when it is done right, and this was top notch.  The bird was well-seasoned, smoky, and still maintained edible skin on the outside.  The mac and cheese was great, I could probably eat a whole portion of it for dinner.  The ranch beans were good, but rich, a little bit goes a long way.  I was very pleased with my meal at Bobby Q.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very good bbq, crappy location, and Blue Moon on tap!

Service was great, but we were there on a fairly slow Tuesday night."}
{"text":"I'm new to Phoenix from Michigan and was really craving some bbq ribs.  I started to go to Famous Dave's, but saw the good reviews on this restaurant and decided to go here instead.  I got the baby back ribs & St. Louis style ribs w/mac n cheese.  Everything was delicious!  The ribs were seasoned just right and it was literally falling off the bones.  It was much better than Famous Dave's ribs.  It is a little more expensive, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"1st time here. We drove through lightning and hardcore rain but it was definitely worth it. Waitress was nice, the manager came by to check on us and the food was very very good. We are visiting from CA and we will make sure to eat here next visit. Complimentary cornbread with sweet butter, yum!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience... My boyfriend and I came here the other day had to wait not even 5 minutes to be sat. The server came a few minutes later and seemed like he was nervous and new.. A little awkward but overall was nice. He got our drink order and we ordered some appetizers. The fries were delicious the wings on the other hand were just ok.. We decided to share a 12oz WELL DONE  \"filet mignon\". It took about 45 minutes for our food to come out and the server kept apologizing for the wait and said  it was being \"cooked to perfection\". Which was ok since we ordered it WELL DONE. The steaks finally came out and they were nice enough to split the plates for us. I cut into my steak and it was not even close to well done.. Too too pink.. We were upset because it took so long we were hoping it would Atleast Come out properly.. My boyfriend cut into his and it was slightly pink.. So he gave me his steak but both steaks weren't the way we asked... We told out server and he didn't offer to take our steaks away until a manager came by and the manager said we were gonna get some new steaks... They brought out the \"new ones\" but it was clearly the same ones just put on the grill longer... 
No flavor at all and very tough to bite into , if we're spending $20-25 on a steak we have some decent expectations.. My boyfriend and I didn't eat much of the steak the manager had to take a second look deciding if he should take the steaks off.. They gave us 9$ off.. 
Disappointed completely. 

One star for the fries and the delicious corn bread.."}
{"text":"Bobby-Q's is a western family-friendly restaurant that serves a variety of barbeque goodness but they are mostly famous for their steak and their BBQ ribs. The restaurant has subdued lighting with lots of activity of people enjoying themselves with friendly servers. You have the choice of enjoying the bar setting, the dance club as well as sitting down and enjoying the amazing food. Bobby-Q has a well-designed menu that is easy to understand with reasonable prices for their amazing food."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I'm a vegetarian.  What's that you say?  A vegetarian?!  What the heck is a vegetarian doing reviewing a BBQ place?  Settle down folks, I come in peace!

I have found myself at Bobby Q's a couple times now for my husband's work holiday party.  As I'm sure you could guess, this is likely the last place I would consider going, as I don't eat meat and I certainly wouldn't expect a bbq place to cater to my diet. :)  But I have to say it is probably one of the most vegetarian-friendly, meat-centric restaurants I have ever been to - is that a thing?  (Sorry Bobby Q's if I'm ruining your rep)

If you are a vegetarian and somehow find yourself here, you can definitely survive - in fact, you can actually really enjoy your meal. There are a few salads on the menu and also a bunch of great side dishes that you can assemble (tapas-style) to create a tasty vegetarian meal - my favorite combo is their baked potato (sans bacon), roasted veggies (super tasty) and the mac and cheese (seriously good).  In addition to the salads and sides there are several starters on the menu that will work as well as some a-la-carte items.  

The staff there are great and they are super accommodating - no eye rolling when you say, \"I'm vegetarian, can I order a bunch of sides?\" just a friendly, \"Sure, what would you like?\"  

And for all you meat eaters, check out the rest of the reviews - Bobby Q's clearly knows what they are doing.  Both times I've been there they are packed and its clearly a popular place."}
{"text":"If your coming to Phoenix you must eat here and be sure to ask for Amanda she is the best waitress in the place"}
{"text":"If your into all things smoked or BBQ this place it the place for you! The b.b ribs are fall off the bone delicious! Love the ambiance, low lights, and country music! 
Don't worry about not getting dessert. They give you complimentary freshly made doughnuts. Yummy x100! 
Lunch time is the best time. love the wait staff! Good job you guys."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I've ever had. And I've been to Kansas City. Low and slow cooking. Beautiful smoky flavor. The ribs were meaty and tender. The brisket was moist and beefy. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The cornbread was warm and tender and sweet. The mac and cheese was flavorful, not pasty. The fries were thin cut and crispy. What a great meal. We took some of it home and it was just as great the next day. The only thing I was disappointed in was the beans. They tasted like vinegar. They really need to do a BBQ bean which would go with everything else. I forgave them when they gave us a little bag of freshly made doughnuts. Just the right thing to end the meal. So go! Take your kids, your relatives and friends. This is some good eats!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night for a group of 7.  All of our entrees were great. Ribs, ribeye steak, brisket and all the sides were delicious. Stacy was our server and she was awesome!"}
{"text":"Had to be the 1000 review for this. It's delicious! It's expensive yeah but it makes up with it with the taste. It's a classy joint. The baked potato is delicious and I love the barbecue sauce!"}
{"text":"At a basketball tournament needed to eat between games, found Bobby Q nearby.  We walked into restaurant with a group of 12.  There was no problem seating us.  We had 3 waiters, all amazing!  Food came out quick and was soooo delicious!  Managers stopped by often to make sure everything was good.  Definitely will return.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation on line for a Friday dinner, and arrived to a very packed parking lot but they had someone at the entrance assisting in the lot and we quickly parked and were at our table within minutes.  The server quickly took our order and was very helpful.  My 3 meat dish (sausage, chicken and Brisket) was excellent as was my wife's rotisserie chicken. Leftovers made a great lunch the next day.  The server was attentive and brought us our check promptly.  The gratuity guide at the bottom of the Bill is a bit tacky, but the Food and service is great!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Went to Bobby Q's for dinner with some friends and have mixed reviews about their food.  

I had their Burger and it was 5+ stars!  It was a mouth fun fest from start to finish. The meat was smokey and very tasty.  Well done, but I was OK with that. The sides of Mac and Cheese were some of the best I've ever tasted and their seasoned fries were awesome!

My friend had their pulled pork sandwich and it was 2-3 star rating. It was bland tasting and needed lots of their BBQ sauce for flavor. Their coleslaw was also missing a flavor punch, so he added some hot sauce to help it out.  The donuts were \"meh\" a little too greasy and needed the tons of sugar.  Why make them if they are just \"meh\", your cornbread is much better!  

Looking forward to trying their ribs, surf & turf and banana cake on my next visit!"}
{"text":"this is my fisrt time to visit Bobby Q?Travis is so nice and patient?he severed us very well. With his help I could order the most delicious food there though I am a foreigner. My husband loves the restaurant too."}
{"text":"GREAT BBQ place in Phoenix...my colleagues and I went here one evening for some dinner and everyone had nothing but nice things to say about them!  I ordered the hot links with coleslaw, and mac and cheese and everything was absolutely delicious and bursting with flavor.  The hot links were awesome, full of spice and a large enough portion to feed two people, I'd say.  The sides were good portions as well and plenty for one person.  I would definitely return during my next visit to Phoenix.  Thank you Bobby Q's!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ i've tried......and the building/ location was awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great to work with!! I use them for catering every once in a while, and will be using them more in the future. Make sure you try the brisket and sausage! The baby backs are also incredible!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great value, great ambiance, great service!  Loved it!  The delicious donuts that came with the bill were to die for!  If Phoenix didn't suck so bad, I would consider moving here to be closer to Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"Great bbq!  They have the creamiest, sinful mac and cheese around!  The restaurant has good ambiance, we order take out from here quite often.  Must try it out!"}
{"text":"Had the two meat combo with pork ribs and brisket. Had mac and cheese and grilled veggies for side. You have to get the Q-rolls which were phenomenal. Cornbread on point. Sooooo good. Gave us little cinnamon sugar donuts at the end. The service was best I've had in the valley. Amazing! Definitely will be a repeat customer. Will was the best server!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here, the food and service has always been great.  Every visit, the manager makes it a point to swing by to see how they can improve their service. Great place!"}
{"text":"I'm not generally a brisket fan, but I always go with the server recommendation. So glad I did!"}
{"text":"First off, two warnings.
 
Do not visit this place if you are on a diet.  
Seriously, you will gain 3 pounds before you get back to your car.
No amount of good intention will save you.
 
And do not expect to enjoy this amazing BBQ restaurant if you are a strict vegetarian.
I mean, whut fer?

I read a few \"reviews\" for Bobby Q that made me wonder why the writers chose a very well known down-home style BBQ emporium, and then expected that the experience would mimic a Chez Souci foo-foo eatery. Huh? 
Whatever!

First off, make a reservation before arriving!  
Everybody in Central AZ knows this awesome joint, so you will not be lonely.
 
Or, if you enjoy having a few drinks before dinner just show up, leave your name at the desk, and taxi on over to the Adult Beverage area. 
Lots of fun folks to talk to while waiting, so its painless. 
They serve appetizers at the bar, if you need a head start. 

Crazy crowded it was - a tour bus with 49 people pulled up as we arrived. 
Even so, we were seated at a table within 40 minutes.

Another warning: 
If you are having a main course dinner, remember that the hot chow rockets out of their kitchen in 5 minutes flat (being a rotisserie and pit BBQ place, most of it is ready and waitin'). 

The servers are all super friendly and most efficient. The warm corn bread and butter hits your table immediately.

What's waitin', you ask? 
Well just about anything you ever saw Barbecued, that's what. 
Incredible slabs of ribs. Fantastic pulled pork. Amazing brisket. Chicken like you wish Mom could have made. Corn served country style (you'll see what I mean). 
 
The huge stack of food (for any meal ordered) will blow your mind and stretch your belt. Even if you arrived hungry as a bear, you can expect to walk out with a plate of leftovers (and house-made corn bread).
Believe me on that.

Yep - you will get messy (they provide wet naps) and will have to deal with some degree of consumption guilt on the ride home.  
BUT ITS WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"I came here by myself while on a business trip and I absolutely LOVED this place. I was seated right away at a booth near the bar, and my waitress was extremely friendly and helpful while I tried to decide what to order. 

I had the Bobby Q's Amber Ale, which is brewed specially for them. If you like ales, this is definitely a good one and goes great with the barbecue. For dinner I decided to go with the smoked pulled pork, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese. It came out so quickly I was sure they were bringing me someone else's order! Literally five minutes after I ordered it was at my table, piping hot. 

It was easily the most tender pulled pork I've ever had, and the BBQ sauce was just perfect. The mac and cheese wasn't be best, but it was still pretty delicious. The cornbread that comes with it was also great with a pat of butter. 

After I paid the check, the waitress came over with a little bag of fresh cinnamon sugar donuts which I devoured, even though I was completely stuffed from my meal. Definitely thinking of coming back here again while I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Took the family out for BBQ. We decided on Bobby Q's. 
First visit, Really great food.and super service, we arrived and the BBQ smoke smell just tells you it's gonna be good.
We had a party of  6 adults and 4 kids. Everybody got, just what they wanted, prime rib, rib combos, bugers and catfish. the food was terrific. That alone was worth the trip from Chandler.
The service was the best I can ever remember, the waiter Cody was like Houdini. He would show up before you even thought of what you needed, very personable and made sure everybody got exactly what they wanted and kept the drinks  full all meal. This guy was a super star, and I'm really a grump if my glass is empty.
He made a great meal a fantastic meal. The corn bread was a real kid pleaser and the  mac & cheese disappeared as fast as it arrived. 
We are planning to be back soon with some friends and hope Cody is working.
Well Done... Well Done!"}
{"text":"Truly the best BBQ Catering in Arizona. I have used them several times for anything from a Company Christmas Party to Birthday and Graduation Parties. Prices are reasonable and the service is great. Best tasting brisket ever and I haven't had anyone at any of the parties they have catered that hasn't loved the mac and cheese and cornbread!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Ugh the bad experience (see my review) at Red River BBQ was the most disgusting BBQ and over all worst experience. So my husband made it up to me by bringing me here to Bobby Q's. 

The Q'lada drink was great! The brisket was so moist and flavorful. Pecan coleslaw Yum!!!!

Service is very attentive and the management exceptional!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had!!! The food was just as good as the service. The manager Taylor was superb! We had a grumpy toddler and he did everything he could to make her happy. The environment was great too!!! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were just looking for something good to eat close by. We stumbled upon this awesome place. It's very good! We got the hog heaven since we wanted that bang for your buck kind of deal! It's so worth it... Sooooo much food, we are still eating left over from last night! The only thing is that the sides could have been a little bigger (it feeds up to four ppl). Besides that everything was great! The service , the food, and the overall experience WAs exactly what we like! We will definitely be coming back and totally recommend!! Yummmmmm , I don't remember the last time I left a restaurant and had that big of a smile on my face ."}
{"text":"I loved the fact that upon seating I was served with some really good, off the chart corn bread.  I ordered the brisket, pulled pork, Mac and cheese, and ranch beans. The protein was super tender and savory. I personally enjoyed the brisket more. The Mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy just the way I like them. The ranch beans were on the sweeter side but some good beans all together. When the receipt was brought to me for payment I received complementary donuts which I thought was so awesome. They sure know what to do to get clients crawling back in.

My friend and I personally felt like the server we had didn't want to be on the job so that was unfortunate."}
{"text":"My wife took me and my parents here to eat on  father's day and the food was awesome as usual. The negative first...our. 5:30 reservation turned into a 6pm seat time...but what can you expect on a day like this. Positive...our waiter Justin was amazing. As busy as it was Justin was extremely attentive and very well  versed in the menu (and he is relatively new there). In addition, his conversational skills are such that it made for a relaxing and enjoyable evening. Thank you Justin!!!"}
{"text":"Baby back ribs were delicious! I love this place, definitely coming back!! It was a busy Friday night but it's worth the wait. Corn bread is an excellent appetizer. We even got donuts to go. I'm very impressed with Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. We had the rib combo (beef and baby backs) with baked potato, mac-n-cheese and Cole slaw. Beef ribs were spectacular and rich. Baby backs were really good. Cole slaw was the best I have had at a restaurant, loved it. Dessert was \"Death By Chocolate\". I died and went to heaven. A layer of creamy ice cream sandwiched by a scrumptious Texas sheet cake with a homemade chocolate sauce. Really a nice experience. Hot donuts on the way out! We fought over how many we each had on the way home. Love keeps no record of donuts."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm a tough critic and this place did nothing but impress. The service was excellent.  Cody was friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu and stirred us in the right direction. The food was amazing you can tell they cook the meats slow and low. All and all a good find for us.
We will be back."}
{"text":"I occasionally enjoy BBQ but it needs to have a great smokey flavor, good BBQ sauce, and not a lot of fat incorporated into the meat. Bobby Q delivers! It looks like a dive bar on the outside but the inside has a very nice atmosphere. The tables are spacious, it's very clean, and they play good country music :) Even better, our waitress provided exceptional service.  I had the beef brisket sandwich with a side of macaroni and cheese. The beef brisket was so tender that it falls apart and the mac and cheese was an indulgence that was worth the calories! I enjoyed the spicy BBQ sauce on top of my sandwich. It has a nice kick but isn't too spicy that it takes away from the flavor of the brisket. My husband had a combo rib plate (baby back ribs & St. Louis ribs) which he enjoyed a lot. He liked the St. Louis ribs a bit more than the baby backs because they were meatier and not as marbled as he had expected. He also loved the mac & cheese and the garlic mashed potatoes. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Rishad, our server, was very attentive and helpful. The food was very tasty and \"deeeeee-licious\", according to my wife. I would come here again any night."}
{"text":"This is a great, casual restaurant experience. The food is delicious, the meat is tasty and tender, and the restaurant ambiance is perfectly fitting."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today, was craving a pulled pork sandwich.. Overall the place was okay, it was nice inside and had a cute set-up.. Service was eh.. 

First the hostess could not answer any of our questions about happy hour.. we asked if it was just in the bar area.. had no clue, sat us in the main dining room and then told our waitress.. Apparently it was one of those restaurants were happy hour is in the bar only (which I really don't understand).. anyway our waitress said she'd give us happy hour prices, but didn't understand that we also wanted to order dinner, (people don't eat dinner in the bar?).. Maybe it was new-training staff day or something.. 

We were given cornbread to start which was good, but just crumbled in your hand.. then my friend got the Poboy Catfish sandwich, not impressed, said it was so freaking dry the fish and everything.. I had better luck with my pulled-pork sandwich.. However, it was a huge mess to eat, which I understand that just how it is, but I had no silverware to try and help.. I got fries on the side and I love fries, eat them all the time.. but these were covered with grease, not just your normal greasy fries but had enough they created a puddle, just too much for me.

Overall the food was okay (say no to the catfish).. I would go back for another pork sandwich but with a side of potato salad instead"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers, this was my first time eating here & it was Delicious. The mac & cheese is a must try, the corn bread was very good and the meat was tender & seasoned perferectly.
And, at the end of your meal, they give you a bag of warm fresh donuts. Thanks Bobby Q for making our final meal in Phoenix wonderful."}
{"text":"I thought the ribs were very good. The meat was falling off the bone. The ribs are not dry rub. They are smoked in BBQ sauce so they are not as flavorful as dry rub ribs. We had the roasted veggies which were bland and the roasted corn which was soaked in a pool of butter. The pulled pork sandwich was pretty good. 
Great service and very friendly."}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight and the service and food were AMAZING.!!!  Our waiter Hal was outstanding.  Would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"We had about 15 people joining us for a celebration at Bobby Q and the food was not worth the price.  I ordered a pulled pork bbq sandwich. The sandwich was very dry and almost half way eaten they finally brought us some BBQ sauce. We all had separate checks and they just automatically put a 18% gratuity on all of the bills. So some people tipped twice.  We where not happy and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Bobby Q never disappoints.  They serve the best chocolate martinis and I have  one or two every visit.  I usually order steak or BBQ combo. Tonight I tried the fried chicken with mashed potatoes/gravy.  Another winner."}
{"text":"Just don't understand the ratings here. Service was excellent. But food was just okay. Brisket and Baby Back Ribs were way overcooked. Brisket was like baby food consistency and tasteless without the sauce. NO smokes ring and no smokey flavor. Weird for a place that says that they smoke their meats on premises with mesquite wood. The grilled vegetables were basically raw with no seasoning. Mash potatoes were good. Ranch beans were good. My wife liked the cornbread. But overall was just okay food wise when considering the main attraction is the BBQ itself. Again service was awesome and she was tipped well for that and not the food. Ambiance is good but I tend to rate places on food and overall experience and the meat brought it down. Much better BBQ places around but perhaps just none in this area."}
{"text":"First time here at Bobby Q and it was pretty decent.  Like the other reviews that loved the mac and cheese, so did my daughter.  The meat portions could have been a bit larger, but the brisket and sausage tasted fine.  Our waitress was great and very helpful as it was our first trip.  First of many, to be sure."}
{"text":"Just ate here today and this place is great! The brisket is delicious and moist and the ribs are a smokey fall off the bone delight. I strongly suggest the Q-roll appetizer to start and the corn bread is off the chain. I had potato salad and its eh average. The mac and cheese is freakin awesome as well. All in all as a bbq lover this place is in my top 3 bbq places in phoenix. Somewhat pricey but you definitely wont be dissapointed."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! I'll definitely be coming back. The service is great also. The apple cobbler is delicious."}
{"text":"We had the \"whole hog\". With back ribs, beef ribs pulled pork and brisket.  Simply the best.  I am always is search of the best BBQ and I think we found it last night.  Some pretty cool cocktails as well."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere, good time. Tried a little of everything and liked it all. The best items were the baby back ribs and mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take out town guest. The food and atmosphere is great. Prices are above average but matches the quality of food. Best BBQ in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Got the Whole Hog Heaven with my family, they ran out of the beef ribs but we still enjoyed two types of ribs, meat and three different sides. With the meats, the beef brisket is for sure one of the best! This is such a great platter for a good price if you've a group of 4/5. I'd definitely recommend this place(: And their cornbread is absolutely amazing! Light, fluffy and buttery (: Lastly, the service was magnificent (our waiter's name is Hunter) and we even got these cute (and delicious) donuts before we left."}
{"text":"Seriously.  I seldom give 5 stars, but it deserves at least this much.
If it wasn't for the location and the super scary after dinner club scene, I would go every.single.day.

Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix.  My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about the Hog Heaven special.  In fact, my puppies mouths are watering too.  Decent prices, giant selection.  One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate.  
 
If you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.  
 
Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ...."}
{"text":"The St. Louis ribs were amazing, and the corn bread is to die for."}
{"text":"Drove from extreme east Mesa with out of town company and can say, not worth the drive. I've bee to Sysco type restaurants that had better pulled pork. Should of went to Scottsdale like originally planned. This place may be good for a quick lunch but dinner with a crowd, not so much. Beer chose was good, quantity was good but lacked on quality for the price. I ordered the 3 meat planning on leftovers work well. But one of the friends at the table ordered the 1 meat meal for $18.00 and chose brisket. He had less brisket than I had (assuming I got a 3rd portion) and it was grizzly. I shared with him and foregone the leftover ideal."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best beef brisket. Not to mention the staff is great and the area is amazing. New in town and this place just aided in my love for AZ."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times now. Everytime we drive into Phoenix for fun or just picking up friends from the airport my husband and I make it a mission to bring them here. From the outside it looks a little shaggyish kind of a place,but the inside decor is very nice. We have yet to be disappointed or else we wouldn't keep coming back. I've had pretty much all the style of ribs and whatever the flavor they're all falling of the bone. The rotisserie chicken is excellent not to mention there corn bread mmm, we always ask for extra corn bread to go and just toast it a little the next day with some butter and holy goodness all over again."}
{"text":"First time to come here since the name change many years ago. We ordered the whole hog heaven. It was high quality meat. Corn bread was delicious. Service was great. They even gave my son a free dessert. Manager stopped by several times to check on us and was super friendly. We will be coming back for sure. Did not try one but the hamburgers from the table near by looked big."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! So yummy. I suggest the pulled pork sand-which and their shoe string fries and pecan coleslaw. And YOU have to get the Q Rolls for an appetizer!! Also don't forget to try their lemonade :)"}
{"text":"BOBBY Q's - I never knew how much I loved BBQ until I ate here. Now I will crave it.

Ended up here for a friend's birthday. The restaurant is big and airy and laid out well. They can pack them in but not like sardines. The tables are nicely spaced out and for such a big place, it has charm and is comfortable. The hostess desk rocks - friendly and efficient. We had a reservation for 7pm on a Wednesday, in the summer. I can only imagine how busy it gets on a weekend in prime season...so plan ahead and make a reservation. And GPS how to get there, if you've never been or are new to the valley. Running on the frontage road near I-17, it's easy to end up on a wrong street. Then again, once you've been here once, you'll never forget how to get back. Follow your gut instincts...

 The prime rib looked so delicious that I had to order it (great prime rib is harder to find than you'd think). But everything I tasted was out of this world:

House Salad (I love this kind of classic salad! For a perfect dressing - combine the dijon and herb vinaigrettes)

Corn bread (ask for honey with the butter)
Prime Rib (medium rare, naturally)
Brisket
Mac and Cheese
BBQ pulled chicken (I have never liked BBQ chicken before eating Bobby Q's - DELISH!)

It was a taste bud bonanza.

**They were out of the Mississippi mud pie (which I am such a fan that not getting to sample theirs could plummet a rating but everything was too good for anything other than 5 stars). So we sampled the cobbler - yum.

The service was friendly, cheerful, competent and pretty much perfect. 
**I will mention that as a group of adults, our meal came a little quicker than was ideal. But Bobby Q's is popular for a reason and the service is so competent that knowing that, I will just order a little slower/staggered, when I return with adult friends. 

Families with kids - you will not have any problem feeding your kids in a timely manner. I imagine the service is perfectly paced for families.

And as if all that isn't wonderful enough, they give you a bag of the best cinnamon dusted mini donuts to take with you!!!  They are as good of donuts as Cafe du Monde serves beignets. Only problem, I couldn't eat another bite.

So diners - here's my final tip - store the bag of donuts in your fridge, overnight and then reheat in the microwave (still in the paper bag) for 30 seconds. Have with your morning coffee. You're welcome.

Bobby Q does everything so well that I can not wait to go back. I'll starve myself for a day or two, before I do. Go hungry. It's amazing."}
{"text":"I took a long hiatus from yelping and now I'm back with a vengeance!  See the great thing about yelp and people actually taking the time to write reviews is how I came across Bobby Qs in a recent road trip to Az.  

Hands down the most decadent, tender, fall of the bone, flavor packed ribs I've ever had.  Second favorite was a tie between the brisket and sausage.  Got one of the meat combos and basically everything was on point and memorable.  Service was excellent--very attentive, drinks and water glass were never empty.   

Easily 5 stars in my book!

Keep on BBQing, Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and the food is amazing! My son is a picky eater and he loved the chicken tenders and French fries. First time I just had the Caesar salad and my husband got their famous burger. He talked me into having a bite of his and it was the best burger I've ever had.    
The second visit, we got the family dinner. We got baby back ribs, beef ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket, Mac n Cheese, potato salad, and fries. They bring you corn bread when you sit down. All of it was delicious. I was really surprised. They give you some donuts when you leave. The service was good and the food is great. You won't be disappointed here. We will go back often :)"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was on point. From the outdoors decor, the friendly greeters and servers, to the varied menu choices!!
The ribs were soooooo juicy, well-seasoned and tender. The meat had just the right amount of fat, making every bite flavorful. The side dishes were all also very very tasty!
I will definitely come back here!!"}
{"text":"Traveling from Minnesota this was our first time to Bobby Q. This is one of the best barbecue restaurants we've visited. We had the Crispy Sweet Onion Block as a starter and then a combo course of Grilled Top Sirloin & Half Rack of Baby Back Ribs with sides. Bobby Q is a steak & ribs joint where you really want to clean your plate but you'll have to settle, like we did, for bringing some of your dinner home for tomorrow! 

The food & drink here is fabulous and the service superb. If you appreciate great barbecue Bobby Q should definitely be on your epicurean list.  And, the Thank Q treat when you leave is a nice surprise."}
{"text":"So, this is our fifth time here.  The food is so great.  This go 'round we split the smoasted chicken with a side of brisket. Yep, you can add meats a la carte.  The brisket was just $7 and was quite a large portion.  In fact, we had enough left over for lunch for one the next day.  What a deal.  I must say that the chicken was so delicious.  Moist and slightly smoky but not so much that it took away from the flavor of the chicken.  We sat at the bar and every bartender was great... special shout out to Savannah, Chris, and Ben who always make us feel welcome and appreciated.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ chicken since my Grandma. Meat is king

Great noise level (keeps crying from being annoying)"}
{"text":"It must be good when I can't stop thinking about their homemade lemonade and their q-rolls. It's what dreams are made of!!! I came here for my graduation lunch about 4 months ago and I just requested to go here for my birthday as well! I can't wait to see you again Bobby Q!!"}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious, the hubby and I split the whole hog and everything was tender and yummy.  We had sausage, brisket, baby back ribs and St. Louis style and the sides were delicious as well, the Mac and chz, beans and fries, yum"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Food was excellent. The meat on the baby back ribs fell right off the bones. Serving size is huge, full rack of ribs can serve 2. The portions for sides were big too. Mac and cheese could of been a meal by itself. Overall, great dining experience."}
{"text":"Bobby Q's entrance off 27th Avenue is subtle and in a quiet area and one of the first things you notice pulling into their lot through the small driveway flanked by bushes is that the place (and its lot) is huge.  It's obvious from its construction, that this building has been here a long time and the massively tall trees in the parking lot confirm that.  I actually parked in an \"adjacent\" lot next to the main one and had a decent walk to the restaurant's entrance around the corner.  The much larger bar facing the lot is NOT the entrance to go through to access the restaurant.

Before meeting my date here, I took a look at the menu and had a mild sticker shock.  The prices are not unreasonable for a Valley restaurant; but being that we usually eat in $ or $$- restaurants, it was quite a bit more than what I'm used to.  The important question, however, wasn't whether the prices were \"high\", but whether food quantity and quality justified them.

We started out with drinks.  I had the Strawberry q Lada ($9.00), which was quite delicious, with the strawberry and piña colada blending very well together.  While waiting for dinner, they also brought cornbread for each of us with butter, which was also quite good, though had it been hot instead of lukewarm,it  would have been excellent.

My date ordered the half baby back ribs with cole slaw and baked potato.  In her case, this was very much worth the $20.00 ... and I frankly can't imagine what the \"whole\" for $6.00 more would have been like!  For out came what I can only describe as half of the brontosaurus ribs they used to dump on Fred Flintstone's car; an overflowing bowl of cole slaw and a potato almost as big as the half-ribs.  I ordered the \"smoasted\" half chicken and can only say, that presentation is everything.  It didn't seem close to half a chicken to me; but since it was served in cut up pieces and on a large plate, that might be the reason why I thought otherwise.  For sides, I had the fully stuffed baked potato (still huge) and the grilled vegetables, which, I can honestly say, should have been double the amount while the potato could've been half the size.  Since my date picked out the restaurant, it was obvious it was a favorite place for her and her husband.  As the \"newbie\", I was very impressed with the taste and while my plate didn't seem to be overflowing like hers, it was more than enough and worth the price.  Before tip, my tab came out to $27.08, including tax.

Service is prompt, friendly and attentive (perhaps a bit too attentive, when you're trying to talk).  Interestingly enough, once the credit card was run, the waitress, who had constantly been checking on us throughout the meal, left us to talk in peace with only an occasional server interrupting to see if we wanted more water or Diet Coke.  Though the restaurant is nowhere near as big as the annexed bar, it is pretty roomy with dark, wood colors and a very high ceiling.  

DIABETIC ALERT:
------------------------

A glance at the menu will tell you that this place is pork and beef heavy.  There are only two chicken dishes and its obvious by what comes out, that chicken is not their specialty.  A diabetic will have a very hard time eating \"healthy\" here.  The more serious you are about watching what you eat, the more problems you're going to have navigating the menu.  This place should more likely be considered \"a-once-in-a-very-long-while\" treat.  Looking around tonight, most of the patrons had waist sizes that wouldn't surprise anyone coming here.  For the most part, only the wait staff was thin/proportionate, though not always.  While the food is very good, the staff hospitable and the atmosphere welcoming, this restaurant would probably elicit a big frown on your doctor's face, if he knew you came here ... and probably give HIM a heart attack, if he heard you came here regularly."}
{"text":"Honestly I hadn't been here since the name change however, I was very happy to return.  There was three of us and we all wanted similar things however we all had a hard time deciding. The waitress was great at making recommendations and  getting us what we wanted. We all agree the whole hog is the way to go. The manager even came by to check on us. Great place we will be back"}
{"text":"Biz partner and I were running around today and needed to hit up something along I-17 to grab a late lunch. I've seen the place a million times and love BBQ, but after 4 years in AZ, have never been here! Sucks, because it seems I was really missing out. The place is huge, decor is very sharp and the smokey smell off BBQ throughout the place was a good sign! The service was on point...quick drinks and refills, very attentive and friendly. What a shock! 

Upon sitting down, we received 2 small cakes of cornbread (free) which was a nice filler. I had the BBQ brisket sandwich and my biz partner had the pulled pork sandwich. We both agreed the meat was tender and flavorful. The buns are slightly toasted, so the sauce doesn't get soaked in the bread. The server asked if we would like additional BBQ sauce...I said no, but wished I would have. Although the meat is very tasty, I did find it a little light on sauce (and the sauce is good stuff). After we finished our sandwiches, the server brought 2 little cinnamon/sugar donuts for desert in a small brown bag (fresh, hot and also free!) Very good way to end a good meal. We both agreed, this will definitely be a place added to our rotation as traveling throughout the city!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  My friend recommended this place. Beautiful venue with courtyard seating. Awesome burgers and it looked like lots of other menu items were attractive.  I'd come back in a minute as it's a new favorite!"}
{"text":"We ordered the myriad of meats platter, and it was so much food we couldn't finish it just the two of us. The flavor of the meat was super delicious so was the barbecue sauce. The beer and cocktail menu was just the right size and had great options. The vibe and ambience is very cool and unique. A little bit of a corporate restaurant feel, but I like all the different size tables and chairs and the lighting was very nice at night.
The service was great and very attentive, they were helpful and polite. She boxer our food, which is always nice, and gave us epically delicious, fresh cinnamon sugar mini donuts at the end. Loved them!"}
{"text":"The ribs are awesome! Fully cooked and delicious, meat fell off the bone! The corn beard was money and best part of meal! This is a real bbq spot! If your in the mood for some really good ribs or bbq stop by and try it! Nice staff and clean place"}
{"text":"Lunch today at Bobby-Q. Service great, BBQ Chicken sandwich great, just didn't care for the string fries. They taste good just too dang hard to get them from the plate to your mouth -"}
{"text":"Drove from Las Vegas to Phoenix to catch a concert. My sister and I wanted a good meal before we headed out of town and saw this place on Yelp. We were a little concerned with the area but we are so glad we decided to stop and eat here. The atmosphere was amazing. Sat on the patio and it was comfortable and had a ton of character. The food was delicious and really reasonably priced. The service was as great! I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had so far. We did the triple combo with baby back ribs and beef ribs and brisket. All super tasty. Meats are tender and juicy. And they were so sweet they split the triple combo in two plates for us with a lot of fries on each plate. Cornbread is very soft and good as well except that the butter tastes a little bit different."}
{"text":"Wanted to try but they refused to seat us, even on the patio, because we had a dog with us. Obviously not a dog friendly place unless u have documents to show them the dog is a service dog."}
{"text":"It was OK.  But sub par to a home smoker.  I could hardly tell the difference between the ribs, pulled pork, brisket or chicken.  Overly flavored and over smoked. 
  But their ribs are better than the Texas road kill."}
{"text":"Three couples had dinner on Sat. night.  The restaurant was extremely busy and very noisy.  The service was good and the waiter very pleasant.  I know it's rated #1 for barbque, but we've had better elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful absolutely delicious dinner here tonight - not to be surpassed by our exceptional server Christin. Thank you for taking such good care of us Californians."}
{"text":"Amazing food great service awesome surrounding 
I recommend the drink in the pineapple  and the ribeye"}
{"text":"We went to celebrate birthdays and this place does not disappoint. One couple had the Whole Hog..ribs falling off the bone..brisket moist n tender with a smoky flavor. Prime ribs for others..cooked perfectly and a mouth watering filet that you almost didnt need a knife for. Generous helpings on the sides. Deserts..tried three and only one couple ate all of theirs..the mud pie. Attentive staff and the manager checked on us three times. We cant wait for the east side location to open. We drove from Queen Creek. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Servers from other restaurants should come here and eat on their day off and take notes.  It's how service should be done.  5 star every time.

5 stars for cornbread.  mini doughnuts.  smokehouse burger!!"}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was good until we were asked if we wanted boxes about 15 minutes after our meal was serviced and we were still eating our dinner. This has happened to us twice, the last two times we've came here for dinner. We are here to enjoy our dinner and have a couple of cocktails. If you are out of tables set of some table in the other room for a few hours at dinner time or place a sign on the door that says \"Take Out Only\"."}
{"text":"The service is outstanding!

The food is mouthwatering!

He usually has the ribs...I usually have the prime rib, both are delicious. I love how the corn is served, slices of the corn cob with tasty bites of corn left to nibble. The corn bread is a good as a dessert...sweet with kernels of corn within.  We have made it to dessert once. The sub zero banana cream pie is divine. The portions are huge and there are always leftovers to take home....plus the extra little treat they give each customer!

One of these days we'll try something else on the menu, but for now....we love ordering the same meal each time."}
{"text":"We were on our from the airport to Sedona and it was the time for lunch. We didn't have much time to look for a restaurant so we decided on Bobby Q since it was close to freeway. The restaurant has huge parking lot and seating inside and outside. Waiter explained that they smoke the meat right at the back of the restaurant. We ordered it and it was delicious! I wish the would be place like this near my house!"}
{"text":"They couldn't make two of the cocktails I requested. Strangely, the Mesa location can make both of them. I also asked for large portions of Mayo when we ordered our food. I had to almost beg for more Mayo. Because 1/2 tablespoon of Mayo just wasn't enough. I'm unhappy because they did not listen to me at all. Shame son them. Fair warning all!"}
{"text":"Best bbq ever. I had the combo plate of baby back ribs and catfish. This was plenty of food to share. I'm not a catfish connoisseur so I found it kind of bland but the ribs were amazing. Best I have ever had. The Mac and cheese side and the cornbread was awesome too. The atmosphere is great and service was excellent. 

Also as a side note if you go to the lounge side on Friday nights they have a free buffet with 2 drink purchase. Not as extravagant food as the restaurant but the price is a great deal."}
{"text":"If want a lot of food in a friendly and casual atmosphere, this is the place. I had a half a BBQ chicken w/ Mac and cheese and cole slaw. It was more than enough food. Mixed with cold beer, a table outside, and quick, friendly service, this is a great casual meal."}
{"text":"Last night I joined 4 friends and brought my girlfriend to eat at this restaurant for the first time. Before we got to order, the server was placing our water cups in front of us. The next moment surprised my whole table because the waitress mishandled a water cup and all the water in one cup fell onto my girlfriend next to me. I was so caught off-guard that I didn't even realize that half of my dress shirt got caught in the splash zone too. My girlfriend was just wearing a one-layered sweater so she didn't really have an option to change. As a result, apologies were given and as the waitress handed us napkins, she smiled and told my girlfriend \"you still look good though.\" Everyone at the table had an easy-going personality, so we just shrugged off the situation. Thinking about what happened, I would not be surprised if someone else would go nuts about getting soaked before the appetizers came. 

Now onto the actual food. To the recommendation of my friends who have been here a handful of times, I ordered the fried chicken with mac & cheese and thought it was a great dish. The breading had a great crunchy texture and every bite of the chicken was tender and moist. The biggest recommendation we had was to try the beef brisket, so my girlfriend got that. We both shared our plates with each other, and I thought the brisket had a great smoky flavor to it. The beef was so tender that you could easily slice through it with a fork. Although the mac & cheese tasted really good, I felt that it was a little too heavy for my own tastes. I can't complain about any of the other sides because they all tasted great and were seasoned well. 

My girlfriend still liked the restaurant because the food was great and the décor/layout of the restaurant seemed nice. Having been to many barbecue restaurants dispersed throughout California, I thought the restaurant was fairly priced and the food was top-notch. By the time we got to our check, I asked my girlfriend if she was still wet, and she said \"yeah a little.\" It would've been nice if management stepped in and gave us a cookie to turn her frown upside down, but our waitress was probably too embarrassed to tell the manager anything. Would I come again? Probably, but I'm not sure when because I usually only eat out for special occasions or social gatherings."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to bobby q's tonight with my gf and I will never be back again. Upon arrival the door was covered by two guys whom were both ridiculously rude. They looked at me wearing a pair of fitted jeans and said they were too baggy. As I said before my jeans were fitted! I'm not a high fashion person but I do have a pretty good idea of trends and My style is probably above the normal clientele.The fake ass bouncer at the door had baggier jeans then me and also let others with baggier jeans then me in. Mind you I was only there to spend time with my girlfriend and her sister who was in town, so I would never consider going to a low class dump on my own. At that point it became clear why I wasn't allowed to enter, was due to me being a young black man. I called the bouncer and manager out on it and they couldn't even look me in the eye when I called them out. I'm not someone who goes around pulling the race card bc I've definitely had to work my way up in the world and career wise , where I'm the single person of color in the room. This was down right bigotry exercised at the expense of what was supposed to be a nice evening with family and friends . I will say i did use some foul language which was simply reflective of how I was treated. I hope the owner would address this matter (clearly mgmt is not apt to)as the big board of rules they had up front was clearly targeting of one culture/race of people. I work to hard to earn my money and then be disrespected by two a-holes who couldn't even look me in the eye. Give me an answer!"}
{"text":"I can't imagine it better.  Always multiple friendly faces to greet you, and excellent service.

The onion brick is a must.  I've never been a fan of cornbread, yet I can't stop eating theirs, it's so delicious.  The BBQ is always perfect.  The sides are awesome - great beans, great coleslaw.

My daughter ordered the kids pizza - not expecting much, turns out is the best kids pizza I have EVER encountered.  Great presentation on a square piece of butcher block, and it was really good! 

We all eat ourselves into a food coma, we can't even touch the cute doughnuts at the end.  I love the atmosphere and lighting as well.  I'd like it to be my living room...dinner's ready...."}
{"text":"Hands down the best steak joint in the valley. Fast service, great tasting steaks, ribs you name it. Little pricy but well worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic baby back ribs and brisket, and the onion loaf starter is not to be missed. Great vege sides for the non-carnivores."}
{"text":"Three meat combo!!! I honestly don't have time to smoke 3 different kinds of meat and whip up Mac and cheese for my Sunday lunch.

The Cadillac margarita was ok but made from a mix.  They had several draught beers here too.

The brisket, baby back ribs, and BBQ chicken were delicious!!! The runner even brought out extra BBQ sauce for us which I recommend since they don't put much on the meat when they serve it.  The ribs were fall off the bone, smoky, and charred. The brisket was tender, and my dining companions favorite thing of the meal.  The BBQ chicken was a little pink which is common for on the smoking process and tasted amazing.

Our service was attentive and a manager checked in with us and thanked us for visiting.  For lunch for 2 with 1 drink each it was about $70 before tip.  We had a lot of leftovers which made it a good value!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to visit last night.  This was my third time and their first.  What can I say that has not already been said in previous reviews.  We knew to arrive early on a Saturday (4pm) with reservations for 4:15.  It was just starting to become busy with about 50% tables filled.  Our server was AJ.  Very knowledgeable and attentive.  Made excellent recommendations. We started with those little Q-rolls.  A meal could be made of those alone but we restrained ourselves.  Egg roll type dough wrapped around BBQ beef with Chipotle and bbq dipping sauces.  Yum.  
    My family had beers.  Not a beer drinker myself but they have a good selection.  I had the frozen lemonade which was excellent.  Only change I would make would be to leave the sugar off the glass rim because it falls off and makes everything sticky.  Not enough paper napkins at the table to dip into the water glass to try to clean up the sugar mess.
   Main meals were outstanding.  Between the 3 of us we had sausage, brisket, fried catfish, and 3 orders of baby back ribs.  All were fall off the bone, tender and flavorful.  The catfish was a crispy breaded boneless fillet, perfect size. Extra BBQ sauce was brought to the table by AJ.  Spicy and mild.  Combining the 2 brought on an extra depth of flavor.
   Our sides were cole slaw, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, ranch beans.  All were excellent, especially the mac and cheese which had a nice little kick to it.  At this point we decided if we didn't stop, we would need help getting out of the restaurant.  But we could not leave without those little bits of heaven, hot donuts.  Fresh off the donut machine they are a perfect ending to the meal.  Did I mention leftovers?  We took enough home for all of us to have 2 more meals each.
      Staff is very attentive.  Managers visit each patrons table to meet and greet.  Staff very friendly and upbeat.  Seem to genuinely enjoy working there.  100 best restaurant award well deserved.  Congratulations."}
{"text":"Not just a dinner but an experience!

Just got back from Texas and had a ton of bbq.  Then I took my wife out for bbq and steak.  To my surprise it was some of the best bbq I've ever had.  Super tender ribs where the meat falls off and packed full of flavor.  Hands down some of the best bbq i've ever had.  My wife loved her steak.  We went to a high end steak house in Scottsdale and it easily beat it out with its flavor and tender cut.  I now recommend it as a must stop for great foot.  The service was phenomenal too.  I had mojito's which were so delicious and they didn't skimp on the alcohol.  Thanks Bobby Q for an awesome dinner experience."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm a big fan of BBQ and I have to say that this place quickly became one of my favorite place around the town. Ordered baby back and spare ribs and sausage- their ribs were so tender and tasty. Highly recommend spare ribs, aka St Louis style ribs. Meatier and juicier cut of the two. Highly recommend it. Their sausages were great also- it wasn't fatty at all. Their corn bread was like eating a price of a sweet cake: sweet and a ton of flavor. No need to order a dessert- just ask for extra corn bread. :) highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! The ambiance of the patio is warm,  welcoming,  and comfy. Just what I was looking for to enjoy the weather and a sangria (which was quite strong, not as fruity as I've experienced elsewhere.  I ordered the baby back ribs and was delighted. The BBQ sauce was not as spicy as I usually like,  but was delicious in its own way.   While the roasted corn side wasn't what I expected,  they were happy to offer a different choice . I chose the mac & cheese which was heaven! Finished the meal with a half order of death by chocolate.  The cake layers were incredibly delicious,  the ice cream layer less so. Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"I called to see if they had a complimentary buffet on Fridays and what time.  They used to have one and it was very good.  But I haven't been there in a while.  Was transferred to the bar I guess.  I was told it should start at 4pm.  When I arrived at the front I asked about a complimentary buffet and they looked bewildered.  I was directed to the bar where about six employees in the same T-shirts were sitting.  \"I asked if they had a complimentary buffet today\"  It was Friday at 4:20pm.  The bar was completely empty.  Zombies may have been able to answer that question. But these moronic employees were incapable.  Duuuhhh!  Management? DO YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A COMPLIMENTARY HAPPY HOUR ON FRIDAYS AND WHEN DOES IT START?  Let your employees know!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Sunday Family Feast and everything was amazing.  They forgot to include the brisket but it was super busy, so no complaints...mistakes happen, it's the way they make for them that counts and Joana the manager certainly hit the mark.  She was so apologetic and I got my brisket and some extra for my trouble.  I live a short distance away and it was no trouble at all.  We had plenty to eat with leftovers, so the missing brisket didn't cause any problems.

Thank you, Joana and Bobby Q's!!!"}
{"text":"Started off with us asking where our waiter was...and after that, service was impeccable. The manager came to our table, apologized and comped us dessert. Our server was great with recommendations, came to our table often and again request was readily filled. Definitely decided this is our new dine in spot. Best bbq. Soft, succulent, savory meat. 

Side note. Got a doggie bag worth of treats on the way out. #NewFavoritePlace"}
{"text":"On a business trip and was craving prim rib. Yelp reviews took me to this place for the first time. I had the prim rib with baked potato and corn. The food was very good and the fresh homemade lemonade made it even better!
The girl who served my table ( Monique)was very nice and she made a great suggestions on food.
They also have them insane donuts that they made fresh and they were so good
If I come back to Phoenix anytime I'll make sure I eat at this place at least once !
Thank you all the people at Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"Bobby Q's catered my wedding and I can't believe the number of compliments I got on the food. Bobby Q's was OUTSTANDING. The appetizers went so fast I never even got one! The caterers were really professional. My only issue was that we were not allowed to change our numbers after the wedding was 2 weeks out (We tried). -- Most caterers allow you to change up to 48 hours before the event. This would've saved us a TON of money as we had several people cancel on us at the last minute. We had more food left over than we knew what to do with, and it was a lot of money wasted."}
{"text":"Went here for graduation. Food is good, but service is sometimes hit or miss. I am partly disappointed that I was promised a separate room for my large party, but was placed in basically the center of the dining room.

The BBQ is quite good though and I'd go back purely for that reason."}
{"text":"Corny decorations aside, the food isn't that bad, but not necessarily great. there are about three or four things that are amazing, but seeing as i'm a recently converted vegetarian i haven't had most of  those in a while, the best meat option is by far the ribs. End of story. But the vegetarian options (i.e. fish) aren't really that great. Another Con- the food takes forever! As i mentioned before, the decor is extremely corny and makes it feel like a chain restaurant. Pros include fabulous service/waiters, free donuts, AMAZING sides, and the fact that i feel really popular in there because it is always packed. Overall its a fun place, but nothing special."}
{"text":"It's a little pricy for it to be one of our regular spots but for a fun time out when we have friends or family visiting it is great."}
{"text":"We came here because I wanted to try something different. This place had very good reviews on Yelp so I thought I would give it a try and I'm glad I did. Bobby Q had really great food, service and an all around great experience."}
{"text":"As a GM of a Bar/Restaurant it was a delight to see my Bartender have passion for Bobby Q's. When  asking the different questions about the menu she was right in it and gave great detail. I truly believed that she knew what she was saying! Thank you Ciara for your great personality. Even the other waitress kept asking me, \"Isn't she the greatest?\", yes she was!"}
{"text":"Brought my sister-in-law visiting from CA here for her bday on Saturday. Everything we had from ribs, chicken, beef brisket to sides and drinks was VERY good.  We made a reservation and walked right in.  I wouldn't go anywhere else for BBQ in AZ.  Ambiance is good.   I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food, my wife loved the beef ribs and I enjoyed the Smoasted Chicken.  The cornbread was great, only negative was the shoestring fries.  I will go for the baked or mashed potatoes next time."}
{"text":"Visiting my sis in Phoenix and she brought me here to eat. It was delicious. Portions were generous and prices very reasonable. The outside dining area was very cozy. The staff very attentive and gracious. Definitely a winner in my book."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I came when they closed but they were very courteous, patient and nice in explaining the offerings there and made me a really good dinner to go. The food was amazing. Fresh and tasty. Nice people working there."}
{"text":"My family and I have recently discovered this place. The service is okay, but management is great. We always get a platter that they offer which allows us to try a variety of meat and sides. My preschool daughters are very picky but loved the pulled chicken. I am not a fan of the pulled pork but the St. Louis ribs are incredible and the meat falls off the bone!! The macaroni and cheese is extra, extra cheesy and delicious. The cap to the meal is the fresh donuts they offer at the end, leaving no reason to purchase dessert. To wash it all down, nothing beats their strawberry lemonade served in a frosted glass. Oh my!!! We love it.  It has been challenging to find good barbecue in AZ and this is definitely really good and worth trying."}
{"text":"FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER I WISH I COULD LEAVE 6 STARS.

{"text":"I'm not from Arizona and didn't know how to go around the city. I picked this place to celebrate my graduation. They were very accommodating for a party of 6. Service was not bad. A few missing items that got resolved right away. Portion size was good to share. Quality of food was norma, nothing special. Bar drinks were ok. Parking was easy, the lot was big. Comparable to Lucille's BBQ ribs from California."}
{"text":"Great food and service! We had whole hog to share for three people and we had leftovers. Service, food, price and ambiance five stars."}
{"text":"BBQ restaurants can sometimes be overwhelming with all the choices. Luckily we were sent the one and only Chelsea as our server! She clearly has enthusiasm for her job and an outstanding attitude. She was on point for all three parts of our meal. The brisket was delicious. If I could have, I would have ordered all burnt ends. The meat was juicy and tender. The babyback ribs, flavorful and moist. The appetizer course would have been a great main course. The Q rolls were like brisket lumpia with BBQ sauce or chipotle mayo. The apple cobbler for dessert was just the right combo of sweet and tart. 3for3. Either Chelsea is lucky or she's a Bobby Q's savant. I'd go with the latter."}
{"text":"As we neared Bobby Q's from the rear entrance in the dark, my wife and I had to assume it was the popular bbq place by the glowing Christmas-style lights adorned on the roof and beer signs on the side of the roadhouse-inspired building, as there aren't any signs to notify potential customers of it's presence from that entrance.

Upon nearing the building on foot, I was impressed with all of the outside seating available, complete with an outside bar and several TV's.

We were promptly seated, as it didn't appear very busy for a Saturday evening.  The hostess and waitress were very friendly and knowledgeable.  Soon after ordering our drinks, we were given two pieces of cornbread, which were tasty and not just regular square, dry cornbread that comes from the box.

Soon after we each ate a piece of cornbread and had consumed some our drinks, we couldn't believe it when our order arrived so quickly!  (I've had to wait much longer at Dairy Queen for food).  I got a half rack of St Louis-style ribs, which were very good, but a little more expensive than other places charge, but worth it for the quality of service and cleanliness of the restaurant.  The macaroni and cheese didn't disappoint us. It was very cheesy and pleasing to the taste buds. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they give a ten percent discount when you check-in there on yelp, which is always an added incentive.

After finishing our meal, we were given a couple of \"Thank Q's,\"  which are their freshly made small doughnuts that are a nice little complimentary dessert.

Overall, I was impressed with the restaurant and plan on returning there.  I would definitely recommend it to friends, or anyone who wants to have a good time with a large party."}
{"text":"Would give more then 5 stars if possible. ASK FOR PHILLIP!!! customer service is spectacular.  I am the pickiest eater and think everything is spicy. This food was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Make reservations!  We got there at 6 pm on Sunday and had a 45 min wait.  It was my sons birthday so we didn't mind the wait.  We were seated and our server was right on top of getting out drinks. She took our order and  45 mins later our food finally came.  I watched other tables that had been seated after us by 20 mins receive their food long before ours ever came out.  Our server did finally come to tell us there had been a mix up and the manager would be out to explain and offer dessert for our inconvenience.  I figured another server had taken our plates. or Our ticket had been lost.  The place was mobbed so I do expect some inaccuracy.  The manager did come over and asked \"How is everything tasting\"  and before we could empty our mouths to speak I put my thumb up and she did an about face and left.  It took 2 hours to get a table and food and less than 10 mins to eat.  We told the server the manager didn't even give us time to respond.  The manager came out and offered us dessert at no cost.  In the end our  entire meal was on the house.  I didn't expect that but they obviously wanted us back.    I'm sure we will give it another try because the food was exceptional..Although the grilled veggies were too greasy and over cooked."}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions, great service too!! Yum yum!! Fantastic donuts! Stopped in from out-of-town and highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Had a service issue when I visited earlier this year.  Taylor more than corrected the issue.  Called me several times over the last few months to make sure I was coming back so he could correct the issue.  Such a rarity to have someone intentionally provide such great customer service.  And the food is outstanding!  Highly recommend the brisket which you can cut with a fork!  We brought friends who had not visited before and now they have a new go-to place!"}
{"text":"BBQ Chicken sandwich was too dry. Baby back ribs were good, brisket was so-so. Yummy cornbread. 
Customer service was excellent. 
Park in the back if you're going to take your food to-go."}
{"text":"Great Customer Service! Great Food! 
Did take-out while in town, food was ready in the time they said customer service was great, got back to the room, noticed what I thought was an incomplete order, so I called and talked with Taylor (The Manager) who assured me he would take care of it. 
We preceded to devour the BBQ that we had, which was f-ing great! After we were done I ran down to Bobbies (just around the corner) to get what I thought was missing from our order. Only to find out it was my mistake 
Regardless of it being me that caused the confusion Taylor wanted to make sure I was a satisfied customer and insisted on a couple appetizers \"on the house\" I was so full I refused and he still insisted on getting me a Gift Certificate! I will be back!"}
{"text":"it's been too long since I have eaten here, I need to go back again sometime soon because, hands down, this is the best barbeque restaurant that I've been to in Phoenix.  I was pleasantly surprised, it surpassed all of my expectations and I'm not even a big \"bbq\" type person!  now that's saying a lot!"}
{"text":"This place is BBQ heaven. I've lived in Texas and North Carolina and I won't claim the mantle of a BBQ connoisseur, but I've had a lot of BBQ in my life. Meat and sides were all great. Atmosphere and service to match. You can debate whether Little Miss BBQ has the edge in the brisket game--it's a close call. But this place clearly has the overall edge--a place you can sit down, get a drink, and relax over great food. My girlfriend and my daughter both loved it, too. Oh, and hot cinnamon donuts with the check was a great finishing touch. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have not been here since it was Bobby McGees....a lot has changed.  With high reviews, my husband and I decided to give it a try.

First we got the \"Q\" rolls for an appetizer....AMAZINGLY delicious!!!  Then came little corn bread cakes from heaven!!  I ordered the 2 ribs plate and my husband got the 3 meat plate.  The food here is amazing!!  The meat is juicy and tender, BBQ sauce is delicious and the side dishes are to die for!  Must try the mac and cheese...its heavenly!  

I can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"We love love love this place. It is truly the best barbecue in the valley ! Just had the ST. Louis ribs this week again and we are never disappointed. The roasted corn is TO DIE for !! We tell everyone about Bobby Q's! (The only thing I would change are the fans hanging from the ceiling. We never sit under a table where the fans are because they look very unstable and like they're going to fall) we frequent as much as we can."}

Hospitality = Friendly 4/5."}
{"text":"Way to go Bob Sikora!   I used to work for Bob at Bobby McGee's during the 80's and early 90's.  Bob has always been a top notch operator with high standards.  Tough guy to work for...but he is a restaurant genius!  Bob has always loved BBQ and he went to school and found the best recipes from the south.   I ate here way back in 2005 and anytime I am back in Phoenix this is a must do for BBQ!  This as good as it gets!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Cool place for drinks especially in the evening. We have been there twice already. Planning to go and eat there again."}
{"text":"A must go spot if traveling for business and wanting to experience a \"local\" restaurant. Food is incredible, service terrific, atmosphere fun. Bar is first come first served if it's busy. A don't miss place to eat in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Everything we had was amazing! From the corn bread to their signature Q rolls and even the salad! I had the BBQ pulled Pork with ranch beans (they contest with my father in laws famous beans) and my husband had the smokehouse burger with shoestring fries! Everything was so wonderful!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here since the Bobby McGee days, gotta say it didn't disappoint. Food was amazing as well as the service. Our server accidentally messed up our order but the manager Jo comped the entire meal.  Now that's service! Although out waitress Alena made a mistake she too was amazing and took great care of us. I'll be back for sure. Thanks Jo and Alena."}
{"text":"New to Arizona from Texas and I know Bar B Q, not many places here that I have eaten at that the food was good, I was really surprised that the food here was very good, not Texas quality but very tasty, I will be back"}
{"text":"Everything at this restaurant is So good. Get the ribs,mac and cheese, and mash potatoes and you will be sooo happy and sooo satisfied."}
{"text":"They have the best macaroni and cheese around! Usually I'm not too crazy of Mac n cheese but I could eat this for days. Its creamy and cheesy and has little bits of crisp baked parts. It's delicious.. A must try. Ribs were delicious and the mini donuts at the end were a cute touch."}
{"text":"The food and service here are great! I'm from Tennessee and we're really serious about our BBQ, but this is some of the best I've ever had. The beef brisket is crazy good. Plus you get free mini cinnamon sugar doughnuts with the check."}
{"text":"First time and we loved it. There were 4 of us and we shared the hog heaven platter. So much food, it was priced right and the flavors were amazing. One complaint was the size of the sides that came with platter. They were not big enough to share, we ended up ordering another side and we're shocked at the price of that single side.
But overall we would definitely recommend and will go back. 
We especially liked the spicy bbq sauce, the pecan Cole slaw, the brisket, and the baby back ribs."}
{"text":"Wow. First of all, the complimentary cornbread from the start was sublime. They don't just give you a lil slice per person. No. They bring you a lot and then ask you if you want more. Next, the PPS's (PULLED PORK SAMMY) we ordered came out hot, fresh, and ready. The meat was thicc but tender at the same time. I have never been so content with a PPS. Best in the valley. I tried some of Mary's mashed potatoes and I had an immediate verbal reaction: \"Flavor\". Then, to our surprise, Colton offered us even more cornbread. Of course, we accepted. AND THEN, Colton brought out the COMPLIMENTARY BAG of cinny sugar donuts (free of charge)! Colton was the best server in the west: treated us right, big smiles, and plenty of BBQ and fun. In conclusion, Mary and I thought that Bobby Q was so far the highlight of senior year."}
{"text":"The security is very rude and disrespectful,  so are most of the managers.  I don't recommend anyone of color to go there because they are racist and they discriminate!!! This wasn't the first time it's happened to myself and a few others in line.  They say no flats on ladies night yet all the Hispanic chicks were flat boots, yet when my sister had them on they turned us away! DISCRIMINATON! !!!!! Who ever own this place needs new security, management ASAP or they will loose a lot of business. As long as your popping bottles they don't care.  Smh, the Damn food isn't even that great! If you're looking for a good time this isn't the place."}
{"text":"possibly the BEST bbq I've ever had! 
First of all the portions are huge! my boyfriend and I thought shared a whole hog heaven would be perfect for us, but we barely finished half of it! their meat is so well cooked, the rib meat falls right off the bone and the brisket melts in your mouth like cotton candy. The mash potato as a side dish is a must too! The complementary cinnamon donut are also a delight, as full as you will be after the meal, you will definitely have stomach for those little donuts! 
The staff here are very professional and friendly.Our waitress was very helpful in answering our questions on the menu and checked up on us every so often to make sure we are satisfied with everything. Great restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Excellent the Brisket was to die for.  Server was very good and explained everything since it was our first time there but it will not be the last."}
{"text":"This was an amazing BBQ place. Coming from a native Memphis boy with a Texan for a father... This place ain't have bad!!

Ashlynn KILLED IT and gave us the best service we have had at any place in recent memory."}
{"text":"Best best BBQ spot in town! The service is amazing. One of my coworkers ordered the catfish poBoy and they misunderstood and brought her the catfish dish. Not only did they replace the dish right away, they let her keep the extra side dish and they comp'd the entire meal. They only charged her for the amazing raspberry sangria we both ordered. I had the brisket sandwich and beans and it was mouth watering. Would absolutely be back and recommend to anyone !"}
{"text":"Truly the best restaurant bbq I've ever eaten.  I do not give 5 stars unless it is truly deserved. ;) I'll be honest, I first went to Little Miss Barbecue today but I didn't want to wait in line and not even know if they would have what I want to order by the time I get to the front so I looked for a highly rated bbq restaurant close by.  I wasn't excited to drive 15 minutes more but I decided to take a chance and I am so glad I did. Bobby Qs is amazing BBQ! The ambiance is impress a date worthy. The food is delicious. Our waitress was so nice and her service was on point. We ordered the Q rolls as an appetizer and a three meat combo with mac & cheese and potato salad. Every bite was delicious.  So I had to try the banana cream pie for dessert. It was all to die for. I wanted to call \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" or \"DDD\" and tell them they missed one! The St Louis ribs are perfectly seasoned, fall of the bone, smoky deliciousness. The brisket was juicy, thick cut, with just the right amount of bark on it. The pulled pork is tender and delicious. The sauce was just as good as the meat. The menu prices are similar to other BBQ restaurants of this caliber. I definitely recommend giving Bobby Qs a try"}
{"text":"One of the few places I can honestly give a 5 star review. I got the meat sampler platter with Mac and cheese. Every piece of meat was tender and had the best Bbq flavor. Mac and cheese was also on point. And to top it off they give you donuts when you leave. I would recommend this place to anyone. Except a vegan."}
{"text":"We were here visiting colleges from California. I was told this was a great place! The food was delicious! Best BBQ I've had. We also got the brisket roll appetizer! Yummy....it was the best. The cornbread and donuts at the end. Yummy too.  I would recommend this to anybody in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. The service was good and the food was ok, but it's just another ordinary BBQ joint in my opinion. I ordered the baby back ribs and brisket combo...unfortunately the ribs were dry and the brisket was chewy. I should have listened to the waiter when he said they're known for their aged steaks. If it's brisket you want, go to Rudy's BBQ."}
{"text":"This was the best BBQ  brisket i've had in ages, very juicy not the least bit dry.  as other have mentioned the mac and cheese is outrageously good, soooo creamy.  better than many homemade recipes. go for the chipotle brisket app too."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!!!  Some of the best BBQ in the city.  It used to be Bobby McGees years ago. But what they've done to the decor and the food is outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Great BBQ, friendly, knowledgable, professional waitress, food was served piping hot. The roasted corn was also excellent. The only downside was no burnt ends."}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed... Since I'm traveling close to 3 hours to/from here... Brisket is a must! Why I was told it's not ready..., ugh! My favorite dish. 

Don't get me wrong, the food is great, but darn it!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! We had a group of 25 and they set up our tables in the patio area. We had 2 waiters and they were very attentive and best of all split the bill for each family. The manager was great he made sure everyone's meal was what they expected. You are given complimentary corn bread that is to die for. We ordered the Q-Rolls, BBQ ribs and the pulled pork sandwich they were all delicious. At the end they give you warm mini cinnamon donuts so save room for some dessert."}
{"text":"I think this is the best BBQ in Arizona!!! I go to Texas all the time so I have had some great BBQ and I think that Bobby Qs is just as good if not better than Texas BBQ."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, or Yelp is!!  I drove all the way down from Anthem to eat on a Saturday night cause the yelp has they're hours posted as open till 11pm on Saturdays got there at 10:10 an was fold the kitchen closes at 10:00 on Saturdays. Even if its Yelps fault the management is still at fault for not updating or correcting hours."}
{"text":"This was my first visit ever to celebrate graduation for my masters degree, and everything we had was delicious. Two of my family members really liked the complimentary corn bread and took some extra home. I had the ribeye with the side order of shrimp, both amazing, especially the sauce on the shrimp and the temperature of the ribeye was perfect. One of my friends who had been there previously ordered a salad she had there before that was no longer on the menu, so they accommodated her request. But unfortunately they didn't have avocado or forgot it on her salad, so they comped it and also gave us free dessert. One of the managers came by a few times to check on us and made sure we were ok with everything else. Overall we had a great experience despite the avocado-less salad, and my friend was still happy with her meal, especially the Q-rolls she made sure we tried!"}
{"text":"The ribs are the best! I ordered the three meat dish. The Mac and cheese side is a must try here. The staff is very friendly and quick to respond. Overall this is one of the best BBQ restaurants I've been too. Will come again if in the area."}
{"text":"If I want to have the same food with the same quality and ambiance in SF it would cost me 100+. The bill came as 40 something total! highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing brisket and fantastic pulled pork. Wife loved the ribs as well. You have to get the mac and cheese for the sides......best ever! Even though you will be full, enjoy the freshly made doughnut holes immediately, so good. With water/soda, we usually spend $25-35."}
{"text":"This place was really great. We were seated almost immediately by a friendly hostess and then greeted by our waitress (Jordan). The food came out in under 10 minutes of us placing our orders and had a nice presentation to it. The beef ribs were flavorful, tender, and packed with meat. I feel like this is where most BBQ joints generally fail, but the side dishes complemented the main entrees well.  To wrap up the meal we ordered the bread pudding. Perfect combination of sweet and savory. Not a fan of the raisins, but I'll live to fight (eat) another day. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I don't know where to even begin about this place. It's fantastic! We were looking for a \"fall off the bone\" rib restaurant. We started a Google search and landed on Bobby Q. I've been in the valley for 20 years and have passed this establishment many times a week, but never ventured inside. I can't believe all that I've missed out on all these years. The restaurant is really cool looking and has an outdoor patio. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation or you're be drooling waiting for a table if you can get one. We had a reservation last night and there was a line out the door of 6 people a head of us. When you go, ask to be seated in server Carissa's section. She is a spunky young gal who knows her stuff. She made valuable recommendations and has a winning personality. She will even sing for you!  She was every bit worth the 25% tip we left. The food is outstanding. I recommend the 2 rib dinner and get the Baby Back and St. Louis ribs. I was there for the BB, but the SLRibs were out of this world. We ordered a couple of dessert, but the warm donuts Bobby Q gives you at the end took the cake. All in all, eat at this establishment!  Carissa, we'll see you soon enough."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good BBQ, look no farther. I recommend this place to everyone I know that lives in or will be visiting the Phoenix area. Make a reservation before you go as there is always a large number of people waiting to be seated. The whole hog heaven is enough to feed our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids under 12). Delicious."}
{"text":"Food is always great! I love their pecan cole slaw & the corned beef brisket. The cornbread tastes like I make at home (Krusteaz from costco).  Kinda pain to find if your heading there for the first time. Head up the 17 til Dunlap & then head back down the road next to the freeway to get to it. It's worth it. Prepare to bring home leftovers. We do every time. About $40 for two to eat (drinking water). Desserts are huge, can order half desserts. Free dessert on your birthday, still embarrassing to be sung to...."}
{"text":"The meat was really good, some of the best brisket I've ever had. But the prices are pretty high and the portions are small to average . The service was outstanding and the donuts at the end are a nice touch."}
{"text":"Our first time here, we decided to stop and have dinner here before heading to the illumination light show and it was delicious!! Definitely will come back again. The food was fresh and very tasty and all American!!!"}
{"text":"I had to really think about this place for it's review. This was my first time visiting this place after smelling the BBQ every time I pass it on the freeway. I was so excited to try the food so I checked out there menu online and notice that it was expensive but within reason for bbq. A friend and I arrived at the place, got the menus and I notice the prices were more then the online price. Anyway I ordered the brisket sandwich and mashed potatoes and my friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and Mac and cheese.  We also order there Q Rolls which is brisket wrapped in flour tortillas and deep fried.  The Q Rolls were good, they gave us 6 rolls that were about 3 inches long $12, my brisket sandwich $14 with one side had more bread then meat. I was very disappointed in the serving size for the price. Not even a 1/2 pound of brisket. They gave me more mashed potatoes then sandwich.  As for the taste, it was ok. No real flavor on the brisket and the spicy bbq sauce was not even spicy and was too sweet. I wished I've taken a picture of my food but it wasn't even photo worthy.  Our total bill for the Q Rolls, brisket sandwich, pulled pork sandwich with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes came out to be $47. I would not recommend this place if your looking for bang for your buck and awesome bbq. This place was just ok. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous place!! It's one of the best BBQ places me and my hubby have tried in our entire lifetime. Ribs are smokey and just so tender and delish! Wings are damn delicious with a bbq and buffalo sauce! The food was 5 stars and the service was 5+. Eric was really nice, brought our food in a timely manner and was very attentive. Jason, the manager, was greeting guests and made you feel right at home. He offered great suggestions on the menu and made our dining experience just amazing with a free dessert (packed to-go). 

We will definitely drop by this place again. Even fly from Cali just to eat some more yummy BBQs."}
{"text":"Hands down best BBQ I have ever had!!! Thanks to yelp we found this place while we were on vacation in Phoenix. I had the brisket and it was verrrryyy good. The pecan slaw was also very good. To top it all off, our server gave us some cinnamon donuts to take with us.  

The service is excellent as well! Our server was very friendly and, knowing we were from out of town, provided a brief history of the restaurant. All other staff seemed very friendly, always smiling. Wish I didn't live so far away from here; I'd eat here all the time! Place is so good it will be a deciding factor to return to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Not the best barbecue I have ever had, but I am a snob, so there you have it.
This is a great place to go with a group of people, or with family.

I wouldn't suggest coming here on a date or for girls night.

The baked potato was not special, but the beer is nice and cold, and they have options that aren't going to break the bank.  Plus the full plates are EASILY share-able."}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite eating experiences ever! The food, atmosphere, service and special attention from the manager was incredible. There aren't enough stars for this place."}
{"text":"Baylee was our server and the manager said she was new, we had excellent service along with great BBQ! Plus the portions are huge, definitely left overly full :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted some beef ribs so we googled places in Phoenix. Bobby Q came up so we decided to try it. People this place is worth the visit. Their menu was loaded with good apps and barbeque. We tried a variety of items which was amazing. Our waiter was knowledgeable about every question I had for him. Not only was he polite but he also took care of every need we had. Thanks to the owner for making me believe there are still good restaurants left out there. We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I love their bbq! I passed by this restaurant for years on the 17 before a buddy of mine tried it and said it was the best bbq he's had in Phoenix. I went with my family and everyone loved it! Their ribs and chicken and chicken fried steak are fantastic. Really nice atmosphere. I love this place."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. It sets a real benchmark and standard for how every restaurant should operate. The manager came out and introduced himself and checked on our satisfaction. Our drop dead gorgeous waitress Christine was very friendly and polite. What a doll. All waitresses and front house staff in this world should learn a thing or two from this establishment!  Bobby Q is a great place to visit!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a BBQ connoisseur, traveled to many places in search of some of the best BBQ places, I know Texas, Kansas City, Memphis, and North Carolina are the BBQ capitals of the US.  I would say Bobby Q's is more like Kansas City style than anything else.  They drown the sauce all over the meats, in which hides the true flavors of the smoked meats.  I have heard about this place many times, and finally gave it a try since my co-worker raved about this place, and said it was voted as one of the best in AZ.  In which, I respectfully disagree BIG TIME.  That honor would go to Little Miss BBQ in Phoenix.  I would say even Rudy's, Joe's, and Famous Dave's is far superior.  So let's get into my review.

I came to this place on a Saturday afternoon with my wife and my brother.  We noticed the building off the I-17, it felt older and had a BBQ smell about it, in which I enjoyed.  The dining room was dark and  had an older feel to it.  We decided to sit outside.  One thing that I did notice is the chairs are very old and falling apart.  I had to move some chairs around cause a few of them had BBQ stains on them.  Anyways, I'm at a BBQ joint, so I don't let that stuff bother me, it's almost to be expected.  We ordered the Hog Heaven and fried chicken dish.  The Hog Heaven consisted of half a rack of spare ribs, 2 beef ribs, some pulled pork, and prime brisket.  It also came with 3 sides in which we ordered shoe string potatoes, mac and cheese and a baked potato.  There was also corn bread for the table.  My wife enjoyed her fried chicken dish, but thought the sides were a little bland and mashed potatoes could of used more butter and salt.  My experience  with the Hog Heaven was just ok.  When enjoying BBQ, I normally don't like ribs completely falling off the bone, and the pulled pork was completely doused with sauce, and the brisket was extremely tender.  I'm not trying to be a BBQ snob, but I like \"competition style\" BBQ.  Ribs should be tender, but hold up.  You should be able to take a bite and not completely fall off the bone, and the same with brisket.  It should be able to pull it apart and be tender and moist on the pallet.  The brisket completely fell apart and was too covered with too much BBQ sauce.  We were served two beef ribs, but one barely had any meat on it, (See Picture).  For 50.00 for the Hog Heaven, I truly didn't feel it was worth the price.  The sides were ok, but how hard is it to screw up fries, and a baked potato.  The mac and cheese was good though.  Overall, our experience was ok, nothing to rave about, but I'm glad I had a chance to experience Bobby Q and see what all the fuss was about.

In conclusion, I'm more of a sauce on the side kind of guy.  I truly enjoy BBQ and enjoy the smoked flavor and the tenderness of the meats.  The sauce should be on the side and help accentuate the meat, not completely covering the meats.  Why smoke BBQ for 6 to 15 hours if you are just going to ruin the flavor?  In the area, there aren't a lot of great BBQ places, but I would give this place another shot, I would just order the sauce on the side.  I love's Joe BBQ in gilbert, but I've had a bad experience, where the meat was a little dry, so I would give this a try again."}
{"text":"I get a lot of flack for it from my family from St. Louis, but this is my favorite spot for BBQ. I particularly like the spicy sauce. The corn bread is also quite good. I've been there a few times for dinner and go with my brother for lunch about once a month and have never had bad service.

The atmosphere and decor are great and you immediately smell the slow cooking meat as you enter the door. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow!  We were returning to Sky Harbor airport from Williams, and wanted to grab something near I-17.  Reviews were good for this place, and we were not disappointed.   We were seated within five minutes (although they originally said 15-25 minute wait), and our server was there almost instantly.  Since we couldn't take leftovers with us, he recommended that the three of us split the three meat combo, and that was perfect!  We got the baby-back ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.   While the pulled pork was just OK, the ribs and the brisket were wonderful (our daughter, a rib snob if there ever was one, pronounced the ribs as being the best she'd ever had)!  The pre-meal cornbread was decent (a bit crumbly), and the free cinnamon-sugar mini-donuts after the meal were tasty, if a bit over-sugared.   We also ordered two sides: the baked potato with all the fixings was good, and the mac & cheese was close to incredible (never thought I'd put the words \"mac & cheese\" and \"incredible\" in the same sentence, but there you go).  All through the meal, our server checked on us every five minutes or so, and was always there with iced tea & soda refills, extra sauce, and so on.  And we were in and out in less than 30 minutes (usually I don't care, but with a flight to catch, that was important).   Wish these guys were closer to Boise -- I know we'd be regulars!

If you're in a hurry, might want to call ahead for reservations.   As busy as they were on a Sunday afternoon, I suspect that they are a madhouse at peak hours."}
{"text":"Great food! Great staff! The free corn bread and donuts are a crowd pleaser! My favorite dishes are the pulled pork and the BBQ burger. Their BBQ sauce is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic service (thanks Kristi M).  The weekly special prime rib sandwich is worth the wait!  Great BBQ chicken, too."}
{"text":"2nd time at this BobbyQs location. Had the 2 meat combo with brisket and pulled pork.  Both had good smoke flavor and were moist and tender.  Food was very good (but not great) and portions were smaller than the first time. Serving size is reasonable but I'm a big guy and they're expensive for BBQ.  Lunch for 2, with a drink each, was $70. Don't get me wrong, I'll go back; but this trip wasn't a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Came here last night. It was amazing! Best service in the whole entire world. Great food! Great atmosphere! Delicious cornbread and donuts."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite barbeque place in AZ. The whole hog platter was great from the ribs to the tender brisket. The sides were excellent too.  Loved the hot home made BBQ sauce also. The drinks and beer were awesome! Love that it's a locally owned Restuarant. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Mitch was our server. Was a super awesome experience. Recommended just the right amount of food. Favorite was the St. Louis ribs."}
{"text":"Our last stop in Phoenix before returning to reality and I was craving some ribs, Bobby Q was a suggestion I'm so glad I opted to go for.

 First of all the building itself is very southern style and includes a trough like waterfall on the back patio with a unique water fountain that is really fun. 
 While waiting to be seated I asked about a fryer like contraption which was for their COMPLIMENTARY churro like donuts and was surprised with two to start our dining experience!
 Love that the manager himself sat us and attended to us a couple times, for customer service oriented was the impression I received, as well as the fact that everyone including our server introduced themselves. 
 Scott was kind enough to offer some suggestions as well as provide another COMP that being their cornbread muffins. O.M.G they are seriously worth the trip  in itself. Just a bit sweet and buttery with a slightly crisp top.

 I ordered the St Louis style ribs with a side of spicy BBQ sauce and baked potato. They truly fell off the bone, super flavorful from the mesquite smoking and the sauce while not unique was very good. The baked potato was good, cooked just a bit too long, however hubby had the gravy which I used a bit for the potato and it was amazing. I suggest asking for the baked potato, if not going for mashed, to have with gravy.
 Hubby had the fried chicken and side of fries with gravy on the side. The chicken was EXTREMELY moist and the batter once fried was light and crunchy. We have concluded however that unless it's KFC or a restaurant in the South we aren't going to get much flavor from the batter itself. However that's what the gravy is for and it was extremely good, I believe sausage based minus the actual meat. The shoestring fries were good but not specially seasoned like we get at our favorite Tucson BBQ joint. 

 We were going to order the mud pie for dessert however they were sadly out. 

Truly amazing even with the minor drawbacks, I would done here monthly if we're in Phoenix.."}
{"text":"I travel to Phoenix quite a bit for work.  My cousin-workers and I go here every week when we are in town.  I love the brisket, baby back ribs and pulled pork.  Two of my coworkers split the Hog Heaven and could not finish it.  The cornbread and the donuts that they give per & post meal are an added bonus."}
{"text":"This is my fav place for ribs. The Mac n cheese is awesome (the closest I have found to my own and I am a southern cook) lol. 

Sometimes it is a bit of a wait as others know about the great food. Service is super friendly and management is hands on, in a good way.  I would highly recommend Bobbi Q's. 
We WILL be back.......often."}
{"text":"The perfect burger. Awesome BBQ! NEVER a bad meal!"}
{"text":"Outstanding barbecue brisket, Austin was our server and his suggestions were on the money!  Great food and relaxed atmosphere makes for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Staff was super fast and friendly.  Kids loved being on the patio with misters and a waterfall made from an old steam engine.  Manager showed us around and checked in on our order.  Cornbread was yum. Caesar salad was fresh and crisp.  Ribs and smoked chicken with mashed potatoes and Mac/cheese also hits! Kids enjoyed the frosty lemonade."}
{"text":"Half baby back with mac/cheese and grilled veggies for $16.   Good house ale. They put sugar in the cornbread (a sin in Southern states) but it was good too.  The server brought us a small bag of fresh/hot mini-sugar donuts at the end to take home.  I can't eat them but they sure smelled great.  Service was excellent.  My faith in Phoenix BBQ was restored.  After a three day trip to AZ for business, this was my second BBQ meal.  The first one was the worst of my life but this was great."}
{"text":"Been here many times and it's really good.
 The pulled pork is very moist and tender and my wife's babyback ribs were awesome,  not a rib fan but ate some and really liked them alot. The Q ROLLS are usually really tasty but this visit they were overcooked and super greasy, I should have sent them back as they always make things right at Bobby Q's. So what would have been a 5 star visit is a four star due to the bad Q Rolls, but if you bring any dissatisfaction to their  attention they are right on it. excellent customer service"}
{"text":"The most amazing BBQ I have ever had. Our server Samuel did an amazing job.  I Cannot wait till this opens in Mesa."}
{"text":"Yummy! I come here for their beef ribs and their rib eye steak.  Atmosphere and service is great!  Their pineapple mixed drink is the bomb."}
{"text":"I would consider myself a pretty good judge of BBQ and Bobby Q was some of the best I've had.  The St. Louis ribs were fall off the bone tender and incredible.  Brisket, tender and flavorful.  Cornbread?  Scary addictive.  My only complaint would be that the Mac and Cheese tasted like it was out of a Kraft box.  Guess you gotta cut costs somewhere.

I think a good judge of who knows their shit on BBQ on yelp is whether someone like Joes Real BBQ or not, apologies if you think that place is good but it just isn't worthy of the praise it gets."}
{"text":"omg!!!! i had the most wonderful experience at baby's steak and lemonade. first of all, service is an a+, everyone there is wonderful. the food is  awesome, i had the crispy philly mix and i loved it, my husband ordered a chicago style hotdog, and my kids loved the pizza puffs and homemade hamburger. im for sure coming again. everything was hot and fresh and my kids adored all the lemon decor, not to mention the fresh squeezed lemonade icees  top off the meal."}
{"text":"This use to be the old Bobby McGees (a classic for bringing dates when I was in High School - it's still the same owner) Cornbread (Good), had the sampler plate with Ribs (Great), Brisket (Good), Sausage (Great), also sampled the Mac n Cheese (Excellent), Coleslaw (Good), Beans (Ok), Potato Salad (Good) & Corn (Great) - and even though I didn't get dessert she brought me some fresh mini Doughnuts (Great). My server, Ciara was Outstanding!!"}
{"text":"i had some amazing corn bread with the pork...beans on the side. This place kicks ass. The food was on point and the service was automatic. my drink got filled before i could ask. Extra napkins brought right on schedule.  Lots of waiters an waitress...and great place to eat. Hate it because its there and not here."}
{"text":"Hands down best BBQ in Phoenix that I've tried. Split the Hog Heaven with my partner and we left with enough for lunch the next day. Will definitely be back when craving BBQ again. 

Also- atmosphere was amazing, from the customer service to the overall dining experience. The manager was walking around- taking orders, refilling drinks, getting drinks, and bussing tables. One of the best restaurant managers I've ever seen and experienced."}
{"text":"I have been here several times before but today was the first time I have eaten here. I love the happy hour buffet on Fridays. The cornbread served at the beginning was excellent. I had the pulled pork sandwich and macaroni and cheese as the side. The pulled pork was great but I didn't care for the mac and cheese. The pasta was overcooked and mushy. The fries were great though. Thr donuts at the end were really good too. Our waitress was very friendly and made sure we had everything. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Always great food - never disappointed! Great service but come ready to wait at least 30 minutes for a table. Come hungry too!!"}
{"text":"so overpriced. didn't have dinner... just horrible  under poured drinks..  everyone was so busy trying to look sophisticated standing around saying nothing.. just vacuous! the kicker is this  hollywood type screen with logos that your supposed to take a selfie or pose in front of.. like its the pork destination station!
Look like prostitutes and old people finally got a big night out!"}
{"text":"This used to be Bobby Magee's (spelling?) and we used to come here as kids! Same owner, different concept. They cure their meats in house and have an open fire pit to
Smoke meats. 

Very friendly staff who brought out my nieces food right away (she has diabetes so this is very important!). Great atmosphere for kids since it gets a bit loud. Food was delicious, especially pulled pork sandwich. Love the corn, the Mac and cheese is very cheesy, so be careful. Love their cornbread! I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Excellent!! The brisket is very tender. The pulled pork is excellent. My favorite was the baby backs. I can't remember the last time I had such tender ribs. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow - Now that's good BBQ!!!  We were at the BBQ festival in Scottsdale yesterday - Bobby-Q had the best brisket, ribs and chicken!  Their brisket is moist and juicy! and the ribs are fall off the bone de-lish!!!  I should have taken a picture of the bare bones so you could see just how bare they were!  Everything was outstanding!"}
{"text":"The best BBQ ever and I am from Kansas City and know my BBQ!

The baby back ribs were tender and meaty by far the best I have ever had.

But don't stop there the four side dishes were also the best ever.

The mini donuts were fantastic,

The staff is unusually friendly and professional."}
{"text":"This second time here. Last time we had the combo BBQ platter, which was good. This time we shared the 14 oz ribeye. It came with 2 sides and cornbread. We chose baked potato and pecan cole slaw. Steak was cooked perfectly, and seasoned well. Both sides were very good.
Our server was Bre. It was her first day, and she did an excellent job!
They give you warm mini donuts as you leave, which was a nice treat.
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good BBQ whatever meat you prefer. Sides are not the best especially the potato salad. Service is good. Prices are a little high but it smells so good walking up to the entrance."}
{"text":"What a clever name!! 

The restaurant is quite large but we made reservations to be safe. We got seated right away, and ordered the hog heaven to split between 3 ppl. We ordered the baby back and st.louis ribs with brisket, pecan cole slaw, mac and cheese and corn. They started off the meal with their complimentary corn bread, which was pretty good! Their brisket and ribs were tender and you didn't need a knife because it fell off the bone. We asked for their spicy BBQ sauce but I wish it was spicier. For their sides, I really enjoyed their mac and cheese and corn, which I recommend. Their cole slaw was just okay. The portion was perfect for 3 people and we even had some left overs. 

To finish off the meal, they bring you fresh mini donuts that they fry and shake with cinnamon sugar. Such a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"I have been a past FAN of BobbyQ, however I recently decided to do take out order, the THREE MEAT Combo. It very disappointing to see the amount of meat placed in the order. Half a sausage cut in half an not even a tablespoon full of the pulled pork. It seems to have a good experience you have to eat there."}
{"text":"So yummy! Totally worth the wait, but I would definitely recommend a reservation. We \"walked in\" three nights before we actually ate there, and each time the wait time for two people was 45+ minutes. But still, TOTALLY WORTH IT!!"}
{"text":"I was in town back in April '13 on business and ate here with colleagues. It was the first restaurant recommended by our customer.

I had the Whole Hog Heaven, ending up taking half of it home! It was some of the best BBQ I've had, though not the best (That was Oklahoma Joe's in KC).

The atmosphere was upscale with a down-home twist. They have a large beer selection and top off dinner with some freshly-baked donut holes (free with the meal).

I highly recommend this place when you're in the Phoenix area and have a hankerin' for BBQ."}
{"text":"I just had the best BBQ here at Bobby Q's! I sampled the brisket, pork and pulled chicken. All were incredibly juicy and delicious. The BBQ sauce was great, and not too sweet. The cornbread was excellent. Service was super friendly and super quick. Sadly, I am only in the area for travel and can't make this a new regular spot!"}
{"text":"Absolutely hog heaven. I need to be wheeled out of this place. Best BBQ I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Looking for mouthwatering BBQ or steaks? This is the place to go. Consistently amazing food and service."}
{"text":"Recently came to Bobby Q's and it was great from top to bottom! I'd been to the Q Bar plenty in my younger years but never the restaurant attached and boy have I been missing out!

The service was fantastic- it was packed but we waited half the time we were told. They have a great outdoor seating area with lots of shade and indoor waiting as well. Our server Jessica (in the bar area) was really great! Super friendly, kept our drinks full, our table cleared of unwanted dishes, personable, great with our three year old and just all around a great server. 

The food was phenomenal! We had the BBQ pulled pork, chicken, and 3 kinds of ribs. All were fantastic but the pulled pork and ribs were melt off the bone delicious! The complimentary cornbread and sugar donuts are not only a nice touch but we're really yummy and a fabulous way to start and end the meal! The coleslaw and Mac n cheese are also worth mentioning as they were very good too! If you have room for desert the Death by chocolate is also worth it, so much that if you can squeeze anymore food in take one to go! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I don't eat beef or or so coming here was not my first choice.  However what I did eat was amazing - the cornbread and salad were flavorful.  The roasted corn side was so buttery and sweet.  I loved the mashed potatoes!"}
{"text":"If you go to a BBQ restaurant I have two words of advice.  

1. Do order what they are known for
2. Don't try to eat healthy  

I ordered the shrimp and it was pretty bad.  I know everyone else loved their dishes but I made the mistake of trying to watch my calorie intake by ordering something that was not their specialty.  I have no doubt that Bobby Q's has amazing barbecue but what it does not have is good seafood.  I plan on trying this place again and actually ordering brisket which I hear is amazing."}
{"text":"Bestest barbecue in the valley!! Thanks for another stellar meal and experience :) the service staff is always spot on and there's always plenty of parking, too :)"}
{"text":"Over Priced OK food....Did not impress me.
Everyone said the cornbread is awesome...NOT!  Dry and over baked. Needed a lot of Butter to wash down."}
{"text":"Service is good every time I have gone but honestly the food is average but nothing spectacular for me. I didn't have any of the ribs and when I did have a steak it tasted like I was chewing on rubber lol. But I love the Q rolls I would literally go there just to have Q rolls"}
{"text":"talk about ambience, and 5 star service.  food and portions are worth the price.  great menu selection, night club next door if you want to dance and drink.  highly recommended"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!!! Love the ambiance and menu selections.
The only part is the wait, but that only tells you how good the food is."}
{"text":"Pretty good sized portions. Get the whole hog if you're with a large group. Ribs,  pulled pork, and all the the traditional southern fixings you'd expect from a traditional North Carolina cookout.
TL;DR-5 shots fired at those who say that southern style barbecue can't work out west out of 5"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ. The brisket is super tender and delicious. The sauces have unique flavors and really accent the meats. 

Our server was Travis and did a great job. Very knowledgeable and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is always great! I took my daughter and wife after our softball tourney and they did not disappoint.  My wife said it was about the best BBQ she has had in a long time. (Next to mine of course).  If you are in Phoenix, I highly recommend this place.  Try the full rack of babyback and the Smoked Prime Rib."}
{"text":"I don't give five star reviews for barbeque restaurants lightly. I'm from Kansas. And Kansas City BBQ is in my blood. That being said... This place has some amazing food. I had the St Louis Style ribs and the sliced brisket and it was amazing. Smoked and grilled to perfection. Just the right amount of bark on the brisket. Delicious ribs that almost fall off the bone. So good that I'm salivating thinking about it a day later.  

We also got the Barbeque Egg roll appetizer and it was delicious. The wrap for these rolls is a puff pastry that is fried around their delicious brisket. Dipping sauces are both wonderful. I really enjoyed the nice sweet smokiness of their regular BBQ sauce. The chipotle ranch is also quite good.

No complaints from anyone at our table. Southern Fried Chicken looked amazing. My wife got the pulled pork sandwich and let me taste... It was really good.

I just don't think you can go wrong here. The only downside is the price. You can easily drop $25 per person here, but it's money well spent on a damn fine meal. 

Possibly the best BBQ in Phoenix. Easily the best I've had since living here and I've been trying them all. You should go here... Your wallet might regret it but YOU won't."}
{"text":"Bobby Q was really good! From their food to their service everything was great. We started off with their famous cornbread which was so good with that butter! For my main entree I ordered the beef brisket and 1/2 rack St. Louis style ribs which was so tender and juicy. I had a side of mac n' cheese and the potato salad which complemented the meal very well. My guest ordered the triple meat combo which included pulled pork, ribs and brisket with sides of the pecan coleslaw and baked potato. Everything was honestly really good and I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a true barbecue experience! I also enjoyed the cute mini donuts they gave for dessert. I would also like to note that we had plenty of leftovers which was awesome!"}
{"text":"Bobby Q - we love you - but Thursday night was an off night. We enjoyed the brisket, perfect hamburger, q rolls, macaroni and cheese, roasted corn, and complementary donuts. Honestly, I eat Bobby Q's for the q rolls and the donuts, I think some of their other dishes are standard issue. My dining companion would point out that the food has a smoke quality that BBQ eaters love. I do not consider myself a BBQ person so I evaluate flavors without the analysis of smoke or BBQ. Thus, I enjoy the brisket, q rolls, and donuts - for their genuine flavor of the food itself. We were returning to Phoenix for a visit and made a list of the places we had to eat while in town. This is one of them! I hate to say this but we visited on a Thursday night and things were just off. My heartbreaks over this review because the only reason I am giving them 4 stars and not 3 is because I have had prior experiences that were 5 star quality."}
{"text":"Enough food to have for lunch the next day and it was still finger locking good. Ribs were well rubbed and right amount of sauce.  The mac and cheese was a meal within itself.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place is really nice and the staff is very friendly, but the BBQ is not good!  There is a sign above the place that says \"Voted Best in the U.S.\" which really has me scratching my head.  Best what???  Certainly not the BBQ!  And certainly not in the U.S.!  I had the baby back ribs and they came out absolutely swimming in overly sweet sauce.  My wife had the Southern Fried Chicken and it came out soggy and undercooked.  I only complain because of the pretentious signs proclaiming they are the best and the really high price tag on the dishes.  

As I said, the service was good and the place is very nice inside and out.  I would love to try something else like their steaks, but honestly with a first try this bad I can't go back.

Unfortunately, with the exception of one place in Phoenix, there is still nowhere to get quality bbq in town.  Seems everyone's definition of BBQ here is crushing every piece of meat with ridiculously tangy sauce to cover the fact that they don't know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Okay, I am stingy with my stars.  This place really deserves all five.  Don't let the long wait discourage you.  We almost did and are so glad we didn't!  We were quoted a 2 hour wait time (with three little boys in tow) and actually ended up being seated within 45 minutes.  We were starving, so we ordered an appetizer and two huge platters (three meat and Hogs Heaven).  Whoa, it was waaaay too much food for all five of us (the kids ate off of our plates and they are big eaters). The portions are pretty darn generous, not to mention they give baskets of the best tasting cornbread I have ever tasted before your meal ever comes.  Our baby back ribs were moist and tender, and I am pretty sure that I ate the best brisket of my life.  The service was great!  Even though they were crazy busy, our server was very attentive.  A lady that seemed to be the manager also checked on us a couple times and brought us the delicious complimentary donuts at the end of or meal.  We will definitely return the next time we are in town.  Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Let's start from the outside! It's adorable with a big patio with trees, water fixtures and a fireplace.  The service from the time you walk in until you leave is on point and friendly.  Our server Jeremiah was fantastic he told us about the restaurant and about the BBQ and how it is prepared. Inside is warm with a western cowboy theme.  Now here's the rub....I don't like barbecue! So what was I doing there? I was with two relatives from KC who are BBQ enthusiasts.  They split the two meat platter with 2 sides and they also added a salad. They said the pulled pork was fantastic! The brisket was good but not fall off the bone melt in your mouth like some, they concluded it must have just been that batch.  I ordered the smokehouse burger with no BBQ sauce and sautéed mushrooms on the side.  The burger is huge! And includes onion strings and thick thick bacon.  It was juicy and cooked perfect medium probably one of my top 10 burgers ever! The \"secret sauce\" which is usually some terrible aioli or thousand island concoction, theirs is a garlic butter on the toasted bun, so good.  Shoestring fries the best I ever had, some places they are so thin all you taste is grease not here.  How is it that I hate BBQ and this is one of my new favorite restaurants??"}
{"text":"Macaroni and cheese that sticks to YOUR ribs?? Yes, please!! 
The cornbread, check! 
The bbq chicken breast, check! 
The ribs, check! 
The pulled pork, check! 
Everything deserves a check!"}
{"text":"BEST BBQ ON THE FACE OF EARTH! My boyfriend and I live for burgers and BBQ and this place we saw on yelp & by so many people telling us to go here and man did we love it! Went there for my birthday today & I got the half rack of ribs & he got the beef brisket sandwich and it was everything we hoped for and more! Best macaroni and cheese and just everything! I wish I lived closer and could go there everyday! Definitely recommend going there!!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say that this is some of the best BBQ I have ever had! The price is very reasonable as well, especially for the amount of food you are given. The BF and I shared the \"Whole Hog\" platter. We finished it, but only because we're gluttons and don't believe in wasting food. It was enough for at least 3 people. The meat just fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. I also appreciate that it wasn't smothered in sauce. They give you the opportunity to actually taste the meat but give you extra sauce on the side if you want it. We had the mac and cheese - gooey and scrumptious and the corn - roasty. The cocktails were tasty and also reasonably priced. We were there on a Saturday night with a party of 14. I don't know if we had a reservation but we were seated pretty quickly. We could tell that they were busy and even though we were taking up a lot of precious space they never  made us feel rushed. The waitress was a doll! Being a large group we didn't all arrive at the same time, needed separate checks, and needed drinks at different times. She didn't miss a beat and everything was accurate on our bill. If you check in on Yelp you get 10% off that visit and you can register for their mailings on their website and they'll send you a coupon for a free onion block appetizer.  There is a club attached to the restaurant but it is pretty bizarro. I wouldn't recommend hanging out there after your dinner. It isn't a honky tonk but a CLUB club for the locals. It doesn't really fit with the restaurant but whatever more power to them using the space to make some money. Apparently every table in the club is sold out every Saturday night so good for them. I forgot the mention the donuts. If you are too full to eat them after your meal, as we were, take them with you! I sincerely regret not bringing them home to be eaten at a later time."}
{"text":"Unbelievably great barbecue! I had the brisket, beef ribs, and pulled chicken. Sides were rather small but were tasty as well. I chose fries, macaroni, corn, and coleslaw. My server was awesome and attentive and the manager Cameron checked on us frequently. I would highly recommend this place. Living in the midwest I was skeptical of getting good bbq while visiting out west. They showed me right!! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Came in for Jacque's family bday dinner.  Our server was training a new server and neither of them missed a beat. The cornbread was just the right amount of sweet and the beef brisket was tender and full of flavor. The GM Taylor came over to check in on one of his rounds. Taylor sang a great song for the table.  A great howl in the end.  Very pleased with dinner and service. Thank you Bobby Q"}
{"text":"My experience here was amazing. My dad and I were both in a really bad mood and looking for a little respite from a horrible day at the hospital. I had driven by Bobby Q's a couple of times and the placed looked fun so we thought we'd give it a try. When we arrived on a Tuesday evening the place was PACKED. The hostess said the wai would be 40 minutes and suggested we have a drink at the bar, which we were happy to do. Our server at the bar Chelsea then set us up at a table by the bar and actually offered to just serve us there. She was incredibly friendly and her enthusiasm felt completely authentic. And after we got our meal I can see why. The food was AMAZING. We had the \"Whole Hog\" barbecue package which was four different types of meat and three sides and everything was great. I can not wait to return."}
{"text":"This was the first time I have been here since the name change from Bobby McGee's.  

First appearance, it seems like the old place, with changes of course. The first thing that struck me was that all the Super Heroes were gone....those were the days when you could come in an have Batman (or if your lucky,...WONDER WOMAN) serving your food.  But like all things, we have to grow up.

Ever since El Paso BBQ closed down on 43rd and Peoria, I have been looking for good BBQ. Well, lo and behold...at Bobby Q's, I FOUND IT!

Start off with the Q rolls (which is a beef brisket rolled in a tortilla and then deep fried) and go right into your 2 or three meat platter. OH YEAR! The brisket is great, the pork is pulled perfectly, and all the meats are tender, juicy and flavorful!

Kristi indulged in a traditional chicken fried chicken and I will be darned if it was not the best I have had in Arizona! 

I had to force down the macaroni and cheese, which was also cheesy and flavorful, but I managed,

As we were leaving at 9:45 PM on a Saturday, the lines were already opening up for the party scene on the bar side....so it shows that even though its no longer the Bobby McGees I grew up with, it hasn't lost its lister for the night life!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Maybe the single worst brisket I have had in my life. Cooked to mush. I have never been in any BBQ place before that would serve that rather than say they are out. I am actually embarrassed for them. 

Nice bartender who cannot mix a drink. 

All around a bummer. Had high hopes when I walked in."}
{"text":"Everything was great here. I really enjoyed the beef ribs the most. Will return for sure. I bbq a lot at home, so for those that like the bbq sauce here, they do sell it for take home, which I've used on my briskets and pork ribs."}
{"text":"I've been in Phoenix for about 9 months now.  I had a serious craving for only 3 things since relocating here from Maryland.  That is UTZ potato chips, a real deal Holy Field Crabcake and some good soul food. 

 I've tried Honey Bears because that was deemed the best soul food in Phoenix.  What a joke!  I'll save what I thought about Honey Bears for their review.  I tried LoLo's Chicken and Waffles - I'll save that one for their review as well but I will tell you that it didn't stand a change to those Bobby Q's Beef ribs... Man my mouth watered when I typed that!

Seriously, nothing else compares,  The sauce, the meat, the seasonings, the flavors .. good Lawd!  The roasted corn, the cute little bags of doughnuts they give you after your meal really is the icing on the cake!

I've only been once but remember EXACTLY how good everything was I've tasted.  I think I should take a trip to Bobby Q's this Sunday"}
{"text":"Fun place! its been a lil while but theres a good chance you will leave with a good story if you go with the right friends or meet the right people...."}
{"text":"I literally don't know what to say. It's amazing clean BBQ food. Great staff and service. The right place to go if you are craving BBQ food. Get the big Hog thing and a bunch of sides, get the deserts. It's all good"}
{"text":"I really usually enjoy going here for a bite & on this review I woulda loved to say that I did, but upon being seated & despite business being light, we didn't get served. We asked for service & nothing happened, but you know how they say things happen for a reason so upon leaving we went to Red Thai at 12th st & Northern. Absolutely delicious & service was wonderful. Thank you!"}
{"text":"TOTALLY AWESOME ! We had a hankerin for some good BBQ, and went for the best. Each time my Wife & I go here, we are always glad we did. We split a \" Hog Heaven \", and had plenty left to bring home. What you see below are Baby Back & St. Louis Ribs, Rotisserie Chicken, Smoked Sausage, Grilled Veggies, Mac and Cheese, and of course Shoestring Fries. A meal fit for a king, and impeccable service, is why we love this place."}
{"text":"My director introduced me to this place! Everything is delicious especially the cornbread!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I wish I could give it zero stars. Owners/managers are racist, racist, racist!!  It is blatantly obvious that their \"dress code\" in the lounge is not dependent on what you're wearing but what color your skin is. If you are African American take your money and patronage elsewhere and save yourself the frustration and harassment. 
We have been here dozens of times over the years and have spent thousands of dollars but we're done!!  Their practice is unacceptable. Shame on them!"}
{"text":"First timer it was amazing ! GREAT service very nice manager visited our table most of all wonderful food ! Portions very big and filling I was surprised. The food tasted very well cooked and real. Table of five and the wait wasn't long at all got seated right when We walked in server was with us in less than 5 minutes. All the servers were very attentive as well as polite. Always made sure empty plates were cleared off table drinks were full and made sure we were satisfied. Me and my family have no complaints! The set up was very nice as well the outside lights and set up were beautiful! Definitely going back !"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy BBQ! And their Mac 'n Cheese is the best! Great place to eat with a group, too! 

But I do have one issue; ingredients need to be listed on some of their items, like desserts. I ordered a chocolate item and when it came to the table, they had included walnuts, which I'm allergic to. When I asked about a different chocolate item instead, I was told by the waitress that it had peanuts in it (which I'm not allergic to but I know many others are). They had to throw away my first dessert in the garbage and bring me something else. 

Seems like a waste of money for a business, and a possible lawsuit too if someone went into anaphylactic shock. List the ingredients on the menu, or prompt the servers to ask the customers about food allergies."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, good burgers, possibly the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten.  GO there NOW!"}
{"text":"Great Baby Back Ribs and Brisket! I'm glad we decided to eat at Bobby Q during our Arizona trip. Also, the service was great all around!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ!  We started with the brisket flautas and got the Hog Heaven.  I know some people said it might be enough for two, but it was more than enough for the two of us and we can eat.  On top of all that you get donuts at the end for free.  Great wait staff and manager.  Next time we are back in the area, we'll come back!"}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ restaurants in AZ. 
The other two are located in Mesa and at the Biltmore of course they are Bobby Q  restaurants to"}
{"text":"I wanted to love it, but I liked it.

It's big. The service is very attentive (though my table was dangerously wobbly.)

The ribs were good - as was the sauce. Cornbread was tasty too.

Veggies were plain. And baked potato was meh. Not enough toppings and just not delicious.

Worth checking out if it's on your way. (It's right off the highway.)"}
{"text":"Had the beef brisket, corn bread, mashed potatoes, and pecan cole slaw. The brisket was great, but the sides were all lacking. The corn bread was dry. The mashed potatoes were had a really thick texture. The cole slaw was fine, but the pecans didn't really add anything, kind of a strange addition. The best part was the sugared donuts they gave us after the meal."}
{"text":"Found this place courtesy of the concierge at my hotel while in phoenix on business.

The brisket Q-Rolls are awsome as well as the ribs.  Some of the best BBQ I have had."}
{"text":"Best, BBQ, ever.

It made the 12-hour drive worth it.  

Between three people, we had the Hog Heaven: chicken, St. Louis ribs, babyback ribs, and brisket.

The sides were awesome too!  All of them!  

The service was also excellent.  Manager came by and asked if everything was alright and the place was packed.

Afterwards, we went to the lounge that's connected to the restaurant called Q-Lounge.  There were a lot of fat chicks.

Apparently the owners traveled all across America and sampled different types of BBQ and thereafter, created Bobby-Q."}
{"text":"Bought a smoked turkey here for Thanksgiving and it was absolutely delicious. Have not eaten in the restaurant... just picked food up.  Only one experience but it was good.  The only reason I have not been back is because it is a bit inconvenient way to drive that far. But once a year or twice a year it is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great food! Loved the \"Whole Hog\" platter,Chicken,beef brisket,beef ribs,pork ribs! Best value for your money.
Catfish,roasted corn and mashed potatoes were good too!"}
{"text":"The brisket is really good and brittle, probably better off getting a brisket sand which. The 3 meat platter is really good, gives you an idea of what you will most likely get the second time around. And after trying between the sausage, brisket and ribs, ribs definitely take the cake! Corn bread is also good as an appetizer, and the grilled veggies really had some good flavor as we'll. The sauces are really good to I suggest the spicy, and at the end we got mini sugar donuts! Yum! Btw our waitress was Chelsea and she was awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The pulled pork and the brisket are above average. That said, I couldn't find a smoke ring on the brisket. The sweet sauce is very good. The \"tangy\" is excellent. IMHO, the best sides are the Ranch Beans and the Mac n Cheese.... 

But, the St Louis Ribs are the reason to eat at Bobby-Q!! These baby back ribs are succulent and the meat falls right off the bone. They have the right balance between rub and sauce. The sweet and tangy flavors are what barbecue is supposed to be. I couldn't find the smoke ring under the rub and the heavy sauce. Sauce-less is not an option. Order an extra cup of the tangy sauce...

The cornbread is moist; a remarkable achievement since most places it's dry as a bone. Bobby-Q's cornbread is excellent and complimentary (Hint, hint to those from Nebraska who believe in charging for dinky little miniature cupcake-sized portions). It's even better with the whipped butter and/or honey on top...

Our waitress was knowledgeable and her service was top-notch. Our iced tea glasses were NEVER empty and she refilled the corn bread basket TWICE. (Hint, hint Nebraska...)

My only REAL complaint is the handicapped parking situation. The handicapped parking spaces are a couple hundred feet from the front door. I try to park out back near the \"Take-Out\" door. There are six spaces there. These spaces are approx 75 ft from the dining room doors, but are NOT reserved for the handicapped."}
{"text":"We usually prefer to cook our own bbq at home to avoid rubbery meats, but needed a quick place to take a family member for birthday dinner.  We were pleasantly surprised at the delicious food here.  The service was so accommodating and all of the dishes were fantastic. The brisket was tender, the corn bread was moist, and the little donuts at the end were a delicious, unexpected treat.  We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great place, great service and great food!! I shared the sampler plate it was very good!"}
{"text":"Love it!!!!!!!!! Gotta have the aged steak!!!!!! Love it love it love it love it is this enough words to post? Nikole is an awesome server!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a co-worker for lunch during a business trip.  We both agreed that it wasn't that great for BBQ.  The meat was incredibly dry, which they tried to hide by adding extra BBQ sauce.  Nice try.   Overall, it was decent, but not extraordinary.  Portions aren't enormous, but just about right so that you don't over eat.

Edit 9/12  - I visited this place again on another business trip this time with a client, and I must say I was highly impressed.  I suspect the first time I went, something went wrong.  Maybe the chef was having a bad day or something?  Either way, I ordered the Pork Pull burger and I must say it was really tasty.  Wasn't dry as my first experience, and had just the right amount of BBQ sauce.  Very impressed.  Bumping up a star to average a 3 and 5 to 4!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best wet-rub bbq that I've ever had! My family and boyfriend came from California to visit my cousins and decided to give this place a try. My boyfriend and I are both originally from Arizona and we've been craving some really good, tender ribs that melt right off the bone b/c we can't be that in California! The service here is super quick and everyone is really nice. BONUS: They also give complimentary sugar donuts! I would totally recommend giving Bobby Q a try!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I caught his name but there's a super friendly gray haired waiter working the night of 3.6.16 @ 8ish. He was so knowledgeable & friendly. 
We split an 8 oz steak & 1/2 rack of ribs. Came with loaded baked & mac n cheese & grilled veggies. Ribs were so good and sauce was perfect. Steak was a tad red but still enjoyed it.
Can I get a moment of silence for the mac and cheese??? Get you some. Super creamy & great flavor.
Complimentary cornbread was so good...glad I chose this place for my pre birthday dinner."}
{"text":"First time here for me and what took me so long to try it?? Food was excellent, service was quick and friendly. Jack, our waiter, was  The Best Server I have ever experienced. My teenaged son even questioned why he was being so nice. I guess when you are used to mediocre to poor service you are surprised when the service is exceptional. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"First time to Bobby Q and we loved it. Brodie was our waiter and he was perfectly attentive without being intrusive. The doughnuts at the end of the meal were heavenly!  Thanks, Bobby Q."}
{"text":"What a joke, took 25 minutes for the waitress to come to the table, food is very comparable to outback steakhouse but for twice the price.

I ordered the ribeye ($36 for a 14 ounce nothing special steak) and my girlfriend had some pulled pork. We also had 2 drinks each, the total came out to $125 before a tip. The waitress was just ok but I tipped decent because I used to be a waiter and it's a shitty job. 

Will never be back again, food quality should be much better for the prices."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Arizona!  Big portions, great sides, and great service.  I got the combo platter with pulled pork, brisket, and ribs...it was outstanding.  The pulled pork is exceptional.  For your sides, you have to get the Mac & Cheese!  

If you really like the traditional KC or TX BBQ joints that are hole in the walls with red and white checkered tablecloths (or none at all) and you have to walk through lines to get your BBQ, then you probably won't like Bobby Q's.  The food is great, but it is a somewhat upscale for BBQ.

Oh yeah, and the \"Thank Q's\" doughnuts are great way to end the meal.  They're so fresh and gooey!!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good.  From the cornbread, to the ribs, bothers and sugar donuts, it's quite delicious.  The service was great, too.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best bbq I have ever had. Prices are great and their specialty cocktails are awesome. I am so excited that they will be in the Gilbert area this fall."}
{"text":"I wish I can give this place 5 stars! Everything was damn close to perfect. From the moment I walked in I was greeted with friendly smiles and warm welcomes. I sat at the bar top where I was greeted within 30 seconds. The bartender showed me the happy hour specials and told me how they prepare their meats. My drink never went under half, it was always refilled! Corn bread was super fresh and Mac and cheese was amazing. The bartenders customer service is top notch, they are definitely a model of amazing service. 

The ONLY reason my review is getting only 4 stars is because my steak was WAY over cooked. I asked for Med Rare and it came out with a slight pink center. However it was still really juicy!"}
{"text":"Look out Kansas City, we have competition! Brisket and ribs were tender (no sauce needed). MacnCheese and cornbread were delicious. Catfish was yummy. To top it off, excellent service!"}
{"text":"The beef is out of this world. So tender it melts in your mouth and very flavorful. Service was great and very prompt. Would definitely go there again and take friends"}
{"text":"Ribs = pretty damn good. the meat was fall off the bones. I wish the sauce had a little more kick to it though. 

I came here comparing this place to phil's in san diego and it holds its own pretty well. The service was excellent, the food and drinks were good. You get a lot of food for the price so it beats phil's in that sense. There was corn bread at the beginning and donuts at the end. 

I'd definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Since we're being completely honest and all, my husband and I were originally planning on going to Little Miss BBQ but found out mid uber ride that they weren't even open. But boy were we oh so happy that they were because we ended up finding Bobby Q's. 

Again, sticking to the whole honesty thing, we loved everything about this joint. From the moment we walked in and saw just how charming the venue was to the exceptionally good customer service they delivered, this place was on point. Our waiter even had the perfect balance of knowing when to check on us and when not to. He kept our drinks topped off and was so knowledgeable about everything they had. You could tell the staff took pride in working there.

We shared a dinner combo: ribs and top sirloin with a baked potato, mac n cheese, and roasted corn. We also shared their signature mud slide pie. Everything was good but let me break this feast down to my personal favorites:

The Ribs - I can totally see why they'd be dubbed \"World Famous\" for it. I mean, the meat literally falls right off the bone while maintaining the right amount of tenderness you can only find in a perfectly slow-smoked BBQ.

The Roasted Corn - I've never had anything like it. It's rich with buttery goodness and makes a stance with the char it leaves in your mouth long after you've digested. This is one of those sides that shouldn't even be a side, it's just. that. good. 

Bobby Q's, thank you for being open when all the competitors were closed - you guys have officially left me with a tasteful experience I will never forget."}
{"text":"Seriously the best BBQ I have had. I fly over from California to see family and this is one of my main stops when I get to Phoenix.  The St Louis Ribs are tender and yummy. Try the corn because they have a smoky flavor and just delicious.  The brisket is also something worth ordering.   Order the $48 (I think that was the cost) Family Feast.  It can literally feed a family of 4."}
{"text":"Order the Q-Rolls, they are great. I don't care if you aren't that hungry, you will eat them.

The brisket is amazing. The sauces are tasty. The pulled-pork is great also. Eat all the meats!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious!  We came into town for the weekend and figured we would give this place a try because of all of the positive reviews. Two of us shared the Whole Hog and even after eating a lot of food we still had left overs. 
The brisket was probably the best I have ever had. Super tender and flavorful. 
The St. Louis and Baby Back ribs were both delicious as was the pulled pork. 
The Mac and Cheese was good but the beans left a little to be desired. 
Overall very happy with the food and the little donut at the end was a nice little bonus."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best BBQ restraunts I have ever been to date. I have been to many, Rib joints, and I am definitely an eater. Great fall of the bone ribs, and has amazing sauce that accompanies it. We had the Whole Hog Feast, and it was amazing. You MUST get the Baby back ribs - completely fall off the bone. I just got my braces today, and it didn't even hurt my sore mouth eating the ribs! If you're in town, come on down to Bobby-Q!"}
{"text":"Awesome bbq, cann i say awesome 1 more time i love this place... food is off the chain..."}
{"text":"Always enjoy my dining experience at Bobby Q's! The service and staff are attentive and professional!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Better than Lucille's in my opinion. I wish we had this in LA!"}
{"text":"Gutes Essen. Restaurant war gut besucht. Das nächste mal würde ich Baby Back Rib bestellen. BBQ Sauce ist sehr gut."}
{"text":"Recently voted one of the top 100 barbecue places on yelp, this is a must visit if you're in the Phoenix area.

The backyard patio is beautifully lit, has a really cool waterfall, and there are mister machines on the ceiling which help on those really hot Phoenix summer days.

Their food was excellent! I had the big potato with brisket on top and a side of sweet potato fries. It was amazing! This we potato fries are seasoned with a hint of cinnamon which makes him quite... sweet. It was the perfect amount of food. The chipotle ranch sauce that came with the sweet potato fries had a zesty finish.

I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First off made a reservation and arrived to be seated next to the extremely hot rotisserie.  Very uncomfortable, not to mention it was 112 degrees outside that day.  I asked to be seated elsewhere but the hostesses' excuse was that this was all that was available due to reservations.  Well I made  reservation but she just made another excuse that we needed to be a larger party to sit elsewhere.  I gave it two stars only because my family likes their BBQ-I don't."}
{"text":"They usually have pretty good deals for two or more people.
I have been able to try just about everything from chicken to brisket to pulled pork and ribs. I loved it all. The homemade sides are a must.
Mac and cheese-YES! Usually no room for desert. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is great! Meat falls off the bone and the mac n cheese and mashed potatoes are so yummy!"}
{"text":"Always amazing! I used to work there and I miss the food! Good people, good food, and they aren't stingy with portions."}
{"text":"We have been going here since we moved to Phoenix 4 years ago. We even had our wedding rehearsal dinner here and our friends and family loved it. 

We have tried many items on the menu but my favorites are the q rolls with the chipotle ranch dip as an appetizer. We also like the onion stack. The cornbread they give you is so good as well. My favorite entree is the brisket. It is very flavorful. The best side is hands down the Mac and cheese. It is so creamy and delicious. 

They also have a great selection of beer, wine and cocktails. 

When you are about to leave you get a bag of freshly made donuts in a brown paper bag. I'm usually stuffed but have to eat one hot then take the rest home."}
{"text":"Bobby-Q's is fairly well-known in Phoenix and I understand why. The atmosphere and indoor/outdoor seating are perfect for any occasion. The food comes in very large portions and the restaurant tends to be on the louder side. It's great for large groups. Order the drink that comes in the pineapple... You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Dinner was so delicious at Bobby Q's. The Smoked Prime Rib was awesome! So much food and no room for dessert"}
{"text":"I am visiting from Portland Oregon and this is the best BBQ I have ever been to!  I love the roasted corn along with the St. Louis ribs. :)"}
{"text":"Let me just say that I have been a Yelp lurker for a long time and it was of Bobby Q's food that made me want to finally create an account and leave a review.

I went in last Friday for lunch and the place looked great inside. Very classy interior and our server Jo was incredibly nice and provided us with great service (always refilling our drinks and asking if we needed anything).

I ordered the 12oz sirloin steak which was delicious, as were the mashed potatoes that I got on the side.  My friend ordered a full rack of ribs (half St Louis, half baby back) and I tried some of it....and I have to say it was incredible. The meat was nice and soft and just melted in your mouth.

I really can't think of any negatives about this place, especially when they brought 4 complimentary mini donuts to us on our way out.

I will definitely be going here again and is well worth the money that you will spend there."}
{"text":"Awesome food (ribs, chicken, brisket, mac n cheese, mash potato, roasted corn) and service with the brightest smile all the time from Meghan"}
{"text":"Had a great experience with RACHEL as our server, there was 7 of us! The Kale salad was fabulous! The pork spareribs delicious, corn bread and the Brussels sprouts! My Dad loved his brisket tacos! I tasted their dark beer which was  great and enjoyed the meal with my grape crush drink, was perfect!  Would recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok, I read all the reviews and I hate to swim against the current, my experience just wasn't that great. 1st off the restaurant is super loud, so not a great place to have a conversation, 2nd, I ordered the Brisket and I Love Brisket, but I didn't love it here. I got a huge helping of gelatinous cartilage and fat, and a small helping of actual meat. Now burnt ends are again one of my favorites, but there really weren't any of those dry crunchy ends packed with flavor one would expect. And the small amount of what i did actually eat consisted of 3 unflavorful bites. Lacking any real smoke flavor or even basic seasoning. In my opinion they hope their bbq sauce will give you the flavor the meat is desperately needing. The wait staff where great and the mac nd cheese was super creamy. Other then that, they would have rated a 2. Eat and live well my friends."}
{"text":"I went here with my family for the 1st time and made a reservation through Yelp and I'm so glad we did because it's super busy on weekends. The food was amazing!!! Best BBQ I've ever had! The manager went around to talk to each table and check in with them and made sure they were taken care of. Awesome service, atmosphere, and servers! Definitely recommend Bobby Q and I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice, the service was great, the food was a mixed bag. There were three in the party. One had the pulled pork and one had the brisket. Both were very tender and tasty. The third member had the baby back ribs and was not very impressed. We ordered a mix of sides so we could taste several. The baked potato and roasted corn were also nothing impressive. The pecan cole slaw is just slaw with pecan bits on top. Nice flavor. The grilled veg was a nice mix and grilled till tender. The mashed potatoes and mac & cheese were yummy! One of us had the Bobby-Q amber ale. It was very good and served in a very frosty glass. Desserts were good but not outstanding. All in all, a nice place to eat with good food for typical prices. Would definitely go back again and try something else."}
{"text":"Good beef briskets. Good boasted chicken. Flavorful meats with no extra fat garbage. The prices are fair. The service is always good. I've been to the Dunlap and the biltmore location. Both have nice settings. I love their free doughnuts as well. They give you free cornbread. Their Q rolls are the best tasting with brisket in there as well with chipotle sauce. This is one of the best BBQ places in AZ. Hands down."}
{"text":"Went here for an impromptu dinner. We were going to get dinner with M's parents and we wanted meat so we decided to go here. We have seen this place for years driving by and now we finally decided to try it. The patio was soooo pretty they had string lights everywhere. I love the ambiance. The inside was pretty too, but we kinda got stuck in a corner near a sink? I would have probably preferred the patio.

The service was great, and the food came out fast. The server welcomed us first timers very well, and talked about the awards the restaurant was won which was pretty cool. 

We decided to split a three meat plate and an extra side: baby back ribs, pulled pork, brisket with mashed potatoes, ranch beans, and macncheese.

The meat were very tender and the bbq sauce was good, I added a little bit of the spicy bbq sauce (not really that spicy tho). I felt like the bbq was soft and tender but it was also a little bland? I don't know maybe there was too much hype on this place that I set the bar in my mind so high? It was good but I thought it would be so much better. The sides were pretty good too especially the mac n cheese. Oh and I ordered the frozen lemonade which was nice (wasn't too sweet), felt like I was drinking a margarita ;)

Everyone else did enjoy the meal very much...maybe it's just my taste buds..hmmm...well I'd def come back for more to try it more...


Ooh the bread was sooo good yumm!

3.5stars for me for now"}
{"text":"Very very good bbq to be found here, in a nice setting.  Very good service by very nice people.  If I could, I'd give it 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Went to Bobby-Q for lunch and tried the sampler platter. For my platter I got the baby back ribs, ST. Louis ribs and the smoked BBQ pork with a side of mac and cheese.  My compadre got the same platter but substituted for the sliced beef brisket and pecan Cole slaw so we could both share. Before your food arrives you get two pieces of corn bread and butter and at the end of your meal you receive a sugar donut.

By noon the restaurant was standing room only and our server was very attentive and refilled my ice tea three times. The rib meat really does fall off the bone and you can smell the hickory wood and taste the dry rubbed spices with each bite of rib which was mouthwatering and delicious. We asked the waiter to bring extra BBQ sauce so he brought us the sweet and the spicy sauce to sample.

Baby Back Ribs (Sweet Sauce)
ST. Louis Ribs (Spicy Sauce)
Sliced Beef Brisket
BBQ Pork"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Overpriced for what it was.  Meat was not smoked, tasted like it was boiled.  BBQ sauce was good."}
{"text":"The Q Rolls and the Smokehouse Burger were absolutely fantastic. Will be returning very soon. Outstanding barbecue."}
{"text":"This BBQ is amazing!  The ambiance is welcoming and the staff is very friendly.  Very impressed when the manager makes table visits to ensure everyone is happy.  The food is priced fairly in comparison to portion size and quality.  Ordered the Baby Back Ribs and the meet just fell off of the bone!  Delicious smoke flavor, great BBQ sauce and wonderful grilled vegetables.  The food was hot when served and our server checked back within a reasonable time after being served.  I highly recommend this restaurant to those who are looking for great food and an awesome experience!  And as I am finishing up my review our server brings these warm to die for donuts as a night cap.....O-M-G!!!"}
{"text":"So-so BBQ.  I had the brisket and St. Louis-style ribs with mashed potatoes and grilled corn.

1. Brisket - Average in flavor.  Nice and moist, but the only seasoning was the sauce (sauce was good...sweet Carolina style).  Needless to say I drenched the meat in sauce.  Overall, I found the meats to be smokeless and pretty bland. 

2. Ribs - See above.

3. Cornbread - Very tasty sweet cornbread.  My favorite.

4.Mashed Potatoes - They nailed this side dish.  Smooth and creamy, with a peppery overtone.  I wish I would have just ordered a plate of this as my meal.

5. Grilled Corn - Tasted more \"burned\" than \"grilled\".  I didn't even finish it (which is unheard of since I often think about the kids starving in Ethiopia).

6. Frosted Lemonade - I think I had 4 glasses before I passed out from sugar overdose.  These things are REALLY good!

6. Dessert donuts - tasty, need more of these.

7.  Service - Excellent, no complaints here.


Overall, I wouldn't advise against going, I just wouldn't go out of my way to make the trip out there.  The meats were IMO very unremarkable."}
{"text":"By far the best bbq I've ever had! I read the reviews and I've heard the hype but I needed to make my own judgement. Absolutely delicious. We went (party of 5) on a busy Saturday night so they told us the wait would be about an hour. It didn't take that long at all and if it did, it would be worth the wait. I got the brisket with Mac and cheese (def recommend) and ranch beans. Very good! Our server was Rebecca and she was so great. She was attentive and filled us in on the drinks and the menu. Manager came by and checked how everything was (my favorite thing). Overall fantastic experience and we definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"First let me say that you NEED a reservation if you don't want to wait for a table. I used the YELP site to make my reservation and it was super easy. Next the staff was really great! Potter, like Harry\"Potter\" was our server and she was very attentive and did an excellent job, keeping our drinks filled and checking on us, very attentive. The manager, Taylor stopped by to check on us too. We couldn't ask for better service. Now, the food. We were a party of 5, skipped the appetizers and I'm so glad we did. We ordered 2 of the Hogs Dinners which said they were for 2, but they were enormous and each platter could have easily fed 3 big eaters. (Not realizing that, I ordered a 1/2 slab of the Baby Back Ribs and 2 sides). On the 1st platter we had ribs, both Baby Back and St Louis style, Brisket, Rotisserie Chicken plus 3 sides, Mac & Cheese, Mash Potatoes and Roasted Corn. The second platter had Sausage, Brisket and Ribs; plus 3 more sides.  We had so much food left over! I wish Potter had told us not to order the extra dinner. If you're in the area, don't be put off by the location, stop there. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for the weekend for you sporting event, traveling by myself, so looked around for a good meat/barbecue restaurant and chose Bobby Q's because of Yelp reviews and I was absolutely blown away, food was great, large portions, and most noteworthy was the service... From the bartenders, the waiters, and even the people handling the hostess station, they we're all tremendously friendly and pleasant, and seemed genuinely interested in customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"This restaurant is top-notch is food, fun, and ambiance. Even the parking lot is beautiful...large shade trees in the middle of Phoenix! The scent of smoke from their 18-22 hour meat roasting grabs you as soon as you exit your vehicle. My mom and I came in for a weekday lunch and were greeted and seated immediately. The server, Hal, introduced himself soon after and had our drink orders on the table in minutes. He was a great server: personable, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and food recommendations. He was kind and patient with my mom, stopping to listen to her even though he was slammed with full tables to care for. We ordered ribs and fries and a brisket sandwich with roasted corn. The cornbread was amazing and our meals were out so quickly there was no lag in between. Our food was tender and flavorful, moist and just the right amount of delicious sauce. The roast corn was perfect, as well. The cinnamon sugar doughnuts at the end was the best finish ever! Keep it up, BobbyQ's! We will definitely be coming back!!! (Next time I'm going to try some Q Rolls, for sure!)"}
{"text":"now i know what all the hype is about around town! this place serves amazing and good quality food! I am a huge fan of their ribs, burgers, and their alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"MehBQ. Abysmal service. Would have been a total bust but for the Mac & Cheese side and cornbread. But probably the worst, driest, most overpriced pulled pork sandwich I've had in the Valley. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Took my wife for dinner and we shared the \"Whole Hog Heaven\" which included babyback ribs, st louis ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. The sides we had were fries, pecan cole slaw, and roasted corn.

All the food was outstanding with the brisket and babyback ribs being the standout meats. Least favorite was the pulled pork because there was a ton of fat in it but the meat had great flavor.

Highly recommend and we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"road tripping through Arizona and did a quick yelp search because my friend and I were hungry - happened to catch this fine place for very good bbq - we loved the employees who were so friendly - the manager came by and asked if this was our first time and helped answer questions about people's favorites, very nice.  Food was fantastic - I had the brisket which was so tender and succulent (yum) with grilled veggies; my friend had the pulled pork which she said was tangy sweet and smokey - very nice find!"}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ place.  Minimal wait to sit down at prime time on a Sunday.  The service was very attentive and made sure we were well taken care of.  I ordered the 2 meat combination plate with baby back ribs and pulled pork.  My sides were fries, pecan coleslaw, and cornbread.  The sides were a good compliment to the meat.  The meat was very tender and full of flavor.  It fell right off the bone.  The complimentary doughnuts you receive at the end was the cherry on top of a great experience.  A+"}
{"text":"Yum!! 2 meat combo for $25 Bbq brisket + BBQ chicken + mac&cheese + coleslaw with nuts + corn bread. Super scrumptious!"}
{"text":"I had such a great experience last night for dinner! It being out first time, my husband and I were surprised at the great customer service we received from Mady. She gave us some background of the restaurant and recommended the meals and drinks we got that night. The food was amazing! Overall awesome experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"We came here around 6PM on a Tuesday and heard that it was an hour wait. Luckily, we made reservations and did not have to wait at all! Very easy to make reservations over the phone for the same day. 

Service was really quick and attentive! I ordered the baby back ribs which included 2 sides. It was delicious! The sauce on the ribs really complimented the taste. Great first experience! Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Every time we come here we have an awesome experience!!! The cornbread to start is out of this world!!! Beef ribs are the best I've ever had and the servers crazy is spot on. The owner usually walks around and it honestly seems like he sees every table!!! Super nice guy. We love coming here. The fresh fried mini donuts are mind blowing!!!! If you like bbq, beer, and epic service come here. This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? This is the best bbq I've ever had in my life. So so good. The bbq ribs are so bomb!! My boyfriends favorite is the brisket. And DO NOT SKIP the corn bread. So good. So warm. Fresh. Tasty. Buttery. Goodness. I suggest to make reservations, it's always so busy."}
{"text":"This place is definetly a diamond in the rough. It is absolutely fabulous! The first impression is a great one and the last impression is just as great. I have yet to eat anything bad at this place. Everything is made to perfection each time. I love the brisket, pulled pork, and smokehouse burger. Also, you can't forget the potato salad and mac and cheese! Took my parents here while they were visiting and they absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"When I saw quite a few of my Yelp friends checked in at Bobby Q, I definitely couldn't pass up a chance to go. We went on a Friday night and the wait for a table was about an hour and a half. This was a little bit longer than expected, however we figured we would grab a drink and wait. After seeing how large the drinks were that others around us had ordered, we decided on just one cocktail called Shipwrecked. It was large and pretty sweet with a blue raspberry-coconut flavor. Since this was the type of fruity drink I typically gravitate towards, I was satisfied and would get it again.

Their estimate on the wait time was fairly accurate so about an hour & a half later, we were seated at a table on their outside patio. Our waiter was friendly and came by our table immediately. He went over the menu items and suggested some of the meat plates and sides. I ended up getting a Pulled BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side of Mac & Cheese (which multiple servers seemed to be recommending) and my fiancé got a three meat plate with the baked potato and mashed potatoes. While we waited, we were brought out some warm cornbread and butter to enjoy, and a short while later, our food arrived.

After tasting a little bit of everything that we got, I wish I would have ordered one of the red meats instead of the chicken sandwich only because it was so plain compared to the other items. I'm not a huge fan of red meat which I was pleased to see chicken on the menu, but the red meat had the actual BBQ flavor I was hoping to find. All the side items were good; I personally liked the mashed potatoes the most but my fiancé liked the mac and cheese the most. The chicken sandwich plate and side was small enough for one to finish entirely but we had some leftovers from the three meat plate.

After we were done with our meals, we were brought a small bag with some cinnamon sugar covered donuts. I had seen a couple of people making them fresh at the front of the restaurant when we walked in, so this was definitely a nice & unique treat.

Overall, I would definitely be up for coming back here and giving some of the other menu items a try ... 4.5 stars, just not quite 5."}
{"text":"Rated as one of top 30 barbecue restaurants in the US. Came here at 4:30pm on Saturday but almost full tables. Old style machine for donuts at the entrance with hot donuts boiling and it's free. Ordered onion block, while baby back ribs and 5 jumbo shrimps. The ribs are super tender and juicy, really yummy. Enjoyed the dinner. Too full so have to walk before going back."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try it again after going there about a year ago and not digging it at all.  The sides are better than the bbq...tried the baby backs and found them to not be seasoned with spices at all.Lot's of smoke flavor if that's all you're looking for. Thank goodness for bbq sauce which was pretty good."}
{"text":"Finding good barbecue is a challenge.  With barbecue, people's favorite styles are so different and standards are exacting.  Yelp put me onto Bobby Q.  Impressive ratings.  Rare does any restaurant have the ratings that Bobby Q does.

It was a Friday night during spring training.  We tried making a reservation that day, but they were already fully booked.  The parking lot was overflowing (at night you can use the lot next door at the small \"college\") when I arrived.  Loved the smell of smoke as I walked in.  The hostess said 50 minutes.  I don't think it was much more than 30.

Three of us started with Bobby's Amber Ale.  For those looking for heavy hops (IPA lovers) or deep flavor (stout or porter people), it would be lacking, but I liked it.  We also got the appetizer of little taquitos, Q Rolls, filled with barbecue beef.  Those came with two good sauces.  Very good.

For the meal, I choose two meats: pulled pork and brisket.  Both were tender, well seasoned, smoky, a little sauced (and I wasn't compelled to add a lot more), and moist.  Others in the group got: a pulled pork sandwich, ribs, and a salad with chicken.  Everyone thought the barbecue was excellent, echoing my comments of seasoning, smoke, and moistness.  Everyone loved the sauce.

Side: I got the Mac N Cheese and corn.  The corn was excellent with some taste of grilling and well seasoned.  The mac N cheese was good.  Mac N cheese almost always disappoints, and this was better than most, though I didn't love it.  Many in the group went for the grilled vegetables which were excellent.

An excellent meal.  I can imagine a few being disappointed with the crowds, the wait, or the style of barbecue if it's not their favorite.  I've been to a lot of barbecue places that were not nearly as good.  I haven't gone to any significantly better (except my backyard on 4th of July).  So I'm going to say 5 stars, and I look forward to returning to try the spareribs.

Why 5 stars?  Why not 4?  This is a barbecue place.  I'm not going to rate it on the same scale a high end fine dining restaurant.  For what it is, a steak and barbecue joint, it does it as well as any place I've been to.  I wish it wasn't as crowded, but it's popular.  If you crave smoke, you should find great satisfaction here.  The sides and appetizer were 4+.  But the star of the show, the smoked meat, was excellent.  That's what I came for, and that's what they get the 5 stars for."}
{"text":"There are two things that I am certain of right now.  
1.  The huge mega fight this weekend is a hoax.  
2.  Bobby Q is the REAL DEAL for the style of BBQ it is.  I have eaten at BBQ all over the USA.  I know there are different types for each different region too. This place is very fantastic.  

The cute server Megan did a fantastic job explaining the menu.  She was on top of the drinks and asked us if we needed anything at the right time is seemed.  Very happy with the Megan.  Great job kiddo.

The food was really good.  I am not sure if Bobby Q is a certain style.  I have to research that a bit.  We ordered some little rolls that reminded me of taquitos and some onion thing too.  The onion thing was good.  The little rolls were out of this world.  They came with a BBQ sauce and a chipotle sauce too.  There were six and that was perfect for the three of us.  

We ordered a platter that Megan explained to us.   The platter came with two types of ribs, pulled pork and brisket.  I got the side of veggies.  The others got beans and mac and cheese.  I requested a vinegar base BBQ sauce because that is what I love.  The other guys got a molasses based sauce.  

Food tasting time.  I sampled the brisket first and holly f n sugar jiminy Christmas batman.  That brisket was very good.  I moved on to sample both of the ribs styles we ordered and they were awesome.  Falling off the bone.  The pulled pork was great with my vinegar based sauce too.  The cornbread was really good too. 

The meal was really good.  I am impressed and can not believed I lived close to this place and never tried it.  I like this place and recommend it to anyone.  Please remember food is subjective and likes are different.  We have seen a good boom over the last handful of years in BBQ here.  They are all different styles too.  Texas style, Memphis style and so on.  Like I said give this place a try.

Bring wet naps or ask for some.  You will need them."}
{"text":"Oh wow! This has to be the best barbecue joint I have ever eaten at! The staff is friendly and efficient, and the food is mouth-watering delicious! I have not yet tried one thing on the menu that hasn't hit the spot. I recommend making reservations if you're planning to dine during the weekend because this place is definitely popular with the tourists and locals, but the wait has never been awful. 5/5 stars!"}
{"text":"After reading and hearing about Bobby Q I figured I had to find out for myself. 

When it comes to BBQ I find it, like others, hard to get quality BBQ. If I do venture into something new trying to find that diamond in the rough I have 3 staples to sample: Baby Back Ribs, Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket. I also judge beans and some carb. 

I ordered the staples with beans and Mac & Cheese. I wasn't given an option for wet or dry BBQ. I had to ask as the bartender was walking away to make mine dry and put it on the side. 

The meal started with a very moist and greasy corn bread basket. The greasy texture made me use a fork just to get it anywhere close to my mouth. 

Moments later my dry BBQ arrived and the server started walking off when I had to ask for BBQ where I learned there were 3 options: regular, spicy or a third that I don't recall. Nice to know that NOW. Thanks bartender. 

The ribs looked good but pulling apart showed they were not smoked at all. Just a HIGHLY salty rub and grill time. The pull apart can be achieved by many alternative means. 

The pulled pork was sweet, quality pork, but the exact same texture as what I get out of my crockpot. There was no bark, no sign of a smoke ring, nothing to indicate this was BBQ. 

The brisket is the only reason I gave this place 2 stars. They gave me 4 slices of what I would call Prime grade and perfectly smoked. The brisket showing a solid smoke ring and bark and it barely held together which is well beyond many other joints. 

The Mac and Cheese are almost exactly like Kraft Blue Box, so not original at all. The beans however were al dente and smoky sweet. Again, nothing special. 

To top off the epic failure in service, there was no wet nap offered or within sight. Really?? I just wanted outta there and to let others know, order a steak or prime rib to go."}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong here! The food is top notch and the staff are soo friendly and happy! A very well run restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Bobby Q's.  I've lived in central phoenix for years and I have seen this place hundreds of times (I think I'm always turned off by the location).  Finally tried it out and... it was great :).  The atmosphere/decor are beautiful and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"RIBS!!!  The ribs at Bobby Q's are simply amazing.  Let me start at the beginning.

This restaurant is very inviting.  Open  yet cozy and the patio is nice too.  They bring you hot corn bread when you sit down that is to die for.  They bring butter with it but I think it is already drenched in butter.  Very rich and delicious.  Not your typically dry corn bread by a long shot.

My husband and I ordered the 3 meat combo that comes with 2 sides.  We ordered the short ribs, pulled pork and \"Broasted\" chicken with Macaroni and Cheese and cole slaw with pecans.  The ribs were are absolutely our favorite.  Best ribs we've ever had.  The pulled pork was equally good and the chicken was great too although we would have liked a piece of white meat.  As someone else stated, they bring their two sauces in warming containers so that the sauce is warm and doesn't cool your meat.  The spicy sauce was our favorite and we used the entire container.  My husband said the mac-n-cheese was the best he had ever had.  It was good, I'm just not an expert on that dish.  I liked the pecans on the cole slaw.

My son was with us and he ordered the cheeseburger off of the kids menu.  The adult menu claimed to have some sort of fantastic burger and he was not happy that we made him get the kids burger.  Until it came.  They do not skimp on the kids!  His burger was huge, hand formed, and absolutely delicious!  He kept going on about how great it was so I had to have a bite.  Grilled deliciousness.

The fresh made donuts they give you on the way out are a nice touch but I was way to full to even comtemplate trying one.  My husband and son said they were great.

Only disappointment-Shoestring Fries.  I like big steak fries.  

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Looking for some great food, this is definitely a top 5 place in the valley! From the prices, to the variety of dishes, and ultimately the customer service Bobby Q's is the place to be. When you have family in town, or need a night out with friends, give Bobby Q's a shot. I would recommend the Catfish PoBoy is a long time favorite, and the Ribs are going to be the best you have ever tried! Definitely going to be one of your favorite places to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, i ordered take out so i cant comment on service very much. Have to admit i havent come back, but i do remember the food being worth the price."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious!! And server Sawyer is awesome and fun! The mac n cheese is a must, but there really isn't anything I wouldn't order there! One of my favorite restaurants by far!"}
{"text":"Omg YES!!! Walked in at 6:30pm and they accommodated 30 of us. We sat at different tables but all close! Service was super fast so fast it was all over to quick! We shared their version of the feast so got to sample lots of goodness. The brisket was my favorite and corn bread was amazing. To hard to choose on what to get so get it all! 
I don't know the managers name but she was on it!!!! Thank you for accommodating us!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite BBQ places in town.  The smoked brisket falls apart in your mouth and the ribs also fall off the bone. The meat is the main event, but the sides are delectable as well.  The Mac and cheese is perfectly creamy and the cornbread is absolutely delicious. And what could be better than those melt in your mouth freshly fried cinnamon sugar mini donuts after the meal. Keep doing you Bobby Q."}
{"text":"Bobby Q's is hands down the best barbecue restaurant I've ever been to. The meat was cooked perfectly and came right off of the bone. The corn bread was made from scratch. The sides were absolutely delicious. I would 10/10 come back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have some bbq. The cornbread in the beginning is so amazing. Lots of great options. They even have mini donuts to offer at the end.
Although the group of hostesses stared us down at our table because they were ready for us to leave.
Other than this, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I love BBQ and this place doesn't dissapoint (except for the mac n cheese, tasted like box mac n cheese). Brisket was super tender, ribs fell off the bone, chicken was solid (we got the hog heaven). Try the Q rolls....and try to grab some extra donuts at the end (they're free, like mints)."}
{"text":"Today was the third time I have come here. Each time I noticed other guest who arrived after me get their meals first. I asked today why this was continually happening. I was told if someone else's order was easier they would do them first. Well, when a table of 4 and a table of 2 can get their meal first over my 1 sandwich I will not be back!"}
{"text":"I am not really a huge fan of BBQ but for whatever reason that was what we decided to do. 

We went on a Saturday Night and had I known they take reservations we would have made some. You should too! 

Once we did have our table our waited was a adorable 20 something guys who was absolutely attentive. So much so that when the manager strolled through checking on guests I probably raved about the service more than the food. 

I was with three of my sons who are 12, 9, and 3. My little ones had the mac and cheese. It was super excellent. 

My older son had the pulled chicken BBQ sandwich and I had the pulled pork. I ordered the coleslaw for my side since I like it on my BBQ. The pecans in the slaw are a stroke of genius. 

Cornbread is served that is very good while you are waiting for your meal. We also got the QRolls for an appetizer. My boys loved them. I thought they were OK. 

When you leave they give you a little bag of cinnamon donuts that are made in a little machine up front. The idea is cute but the donuts aren't good. They were actually kinda gross!

At the end of the day it is all about the sauce and the sauce was very good! 

I would skip the cornbread (even though it is free). It actually spoiled my appetite. I would skip the much praised QRolls too. The pulled meat sandwiches and slaw were worth a visit if that is what you might be craving!"}
{"text":"Took my wife last night for her Birthday to try some place different and we were pleased! Being from the south (Georgia) I feel the \"BBQ\"...and this was actually very well done. We ordered everything meat -wise we could and would come back and feel comfortable ordering anything on the menu! Service was perfect, waitress did not hover over us and we certainly did not feel rushed. We will be back, thx Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"From the moment you park your car and step  out there is magic in the air. It is almost a foreshadowing of things to come inside.  And when you finally do reach your  seat  your mouth will water and your  stomach will rumble because everything you've  heard is true. There food is that good.
  As far as restaurants go, Bobby Q has the look of an old industrial factory with a touch of western thrown in. The interior is a combination of wood, steel, glass, concrete, exposed pipes, ducts, and wires. At first it may  look like everything was thrown randomly together, but everything fits in a modern organic way. The overall  effect is entertaining. Your eye drifts from one area  of the  room to the  next.
  Now  the food. For lunch I had their combination platter consisting of the ribs, brisket, and chicken. And as expected, the food looked good. It smelled good. And it tasted even better.  It was hot. It was  tender. It was tastey. But what suprised me the most was the chicken. It held it's  own against against the ribs and mighty brisket.
  For more info check out their  website. Or better yet, just go."}
{"text":"Truly great food. The cornbread was served hot, it was soft and fell apart, unlike the dense briquettes I've experienced at other restaurants. I ordered Bob's Salad and wasn't very impressed, but that's what I get for ordering a salad at a barbecue place. My mom ordered the sampler from the lunch menu with brisket, chicken and ribs and THAT was amazing. The brisket was perfectly tender and fell apart as soon as I stuck my fork in it. The ribs fell right off the bone, and something about the flavor set it a notch above. We were a little disappointed that we weren't offered dessert, because we had planned on ordering it, but the server (who was still in training) didn't give us an opportunity to ask and disappeared after dropping the check. Everyone there is very friendly, the management is very attentive and the atmosphere is unequaled. I would love to host my next event there!"}
{"text":"Server Brodie was super nice and had great recommendations. He was professional and sweet. Food here is awesome and never going to look at BBQ in the Bay Area ever again. He provided excellent service and this place is solid.  The cornbread is bomb and I recommend to do 3 meats combo for St. Louis  and baby back ribs with briskets. Definitely would come back to visit."}
{"text":"A few years back I had seen this cool looking building surrounded by a trees...behind of all things in Phoenix....a scuba dive shop.  I had no idea exactly what it was.  That was until this time around (2018), when we busted out the oracle that is yelp and learned that is \"Bobby Q.\"  A play on BBQ....rightfully so.

Craving MEAT....we opted to pay this location a visit after some afternoon baseball. We parked in the front which was actually the back and enjoyed the greenery.

There was no issues what so ever on getting a table.  Fast and friendly service.  The interior is hard to describe.  I can only say that it is very cozy.  Every employee there was all smiles and working their tails off.  Our server...damn, if I can remember her name and I lost my receipt....she was awesome!  Happy and quick to suggest something tasty when we asked her.

The first thing she confirmed after we ordered was the \"Q-Rolls,\"  These were delicious pastry style rolls with delicious brisket tucked inside.  They were served with a delicious chipotle sauce.  I was so enamored with them, I forgot to take pictures of anything else....with exception of a delicious coconut mojito, we had ordered prior.

Next up was the \"The Whole Hog Heaven,\"  the GF and I split this amazing plate of BBQ.  It consisted of Baby Back Ribs....so tender the bones popped right out.  Beef ribs of which I devoured.  Pulled pork and Prime Brisket with mac-n-cheese and pecan coleslaw.  All for $51.

We were drunk on BBQ.  So good was what I can only say is the single greatest BBQ experience I have ever had, we chowed until there was nothing left.  NOTHING!

No meat sweats.....maybe just a little.  It was meat nirvana that was complimented by a visit from taylor.  Not sure exactly what his role in the experience is.  I can only saw he is a BBQ sage who wants to help you transition from the physical to the spiritual side of smoked deliciousness.

So full....no desert was ordered.  No matter....Bobby Q has a marvelous little doughnut machine and you are given a complimentary bag of tasty, fried dough.

Wherever we stay next year....you can bet your bottom dollar, we will pay Bobby \"Budda\" Q a visit.........."}
{"text":"The Coconut mojitos are the best! And I will not go anywhere else for one. The Prime rib is delicious and always cooked the way I request. The staff are friendly and professional. Plenty of parking too. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Bobby Q. We had the sample platter which came with beef brisket, one side, St. Louis ribs and smoked chicken (which we substituted for more beef brisket) and the beef brisket sandwich. Everything was incredibly GOOD!!! our server saw that we were sharing the strawberry lemonade and ignoring the iced tea so brought out another strawberry lemonade free of charge!!! We were served corn bread as we waited for our food which came out super fast. All that and our bill was only $26!! I definitely recommend this place! And if you tell them you found them on yelp, you get 10% off your bill."}
{"text":"Here in Cali, we call it barbecue, or BBQ!
In Arizona, they call it Bobby Q.

Well, maybe not all Arizonians call it that, but a good number of them do. When I reached out to some AZ Yelpers to find out where I can find some serious BBQ in Phoenix, almost every person mentioned Bobby's name. 

Bobby Q is a huge place that looks more like an upscale steakhouse rather than a BBQ joint. The inside is dimly lit and has a fancy, upscale decor. They also have two big bars and a banquet room. 

Right when our party of four was seated we received some delicious house made cornbread with sweet butter. After devouring the yummy cornbread we ordered two appetizers, their Q-Rolls and their Fire Pie Pizza topped with beef brisket. The Q-Rolls were similar to those pigs in a blanket everyone loves as a child.  Instead of mini hot dogs, Bobby stuffs the little flaky pastries with juicy beef brisket. The Q-Rolls were incredible alone but when dipped in the chipotle sauce that comes with the app, it gave the rolls an even more fabulous taste.  The beef brisket pizza was good but not great. They put lots of cheese on the pizza but not enough Bobby Q sauce or beef brisket. 

For dinner I ordered their three meat combo with pulled pork, beef brisket and St. Louis spare ribs. My fiancé ordered the Prime Rib with Chimichuri shrimp dinner. My dinner was big enough to feed at least two people. Every meat was phenomenal. The pulled pork and beef brisket were both juicy, tender and incredibly flavorful. The St. Louis spare ribs were falling-off- the-bone tender and had a nice smoky flavor. My girls Prime Rib was also really good but her shrimp were burnt, rubbery, and had almost no Chimichuri sauce on them, which upset her a little bit. Once your dinners are brought to your table, they also bring out two big containers filled with warm sweet Bobby Q sauce and spicy Bobby Q sauce. Both of these Bobby Q sauces were great but since I'm a huge fan of spicy I preferred the spicy sauce over the sweet one. My dinner came with three sides while my girls came with two. These are the sides we got.
Mac and cheese (we both got this) 
Pecan Coleslaw
Loaded Baked Potato
Roasted Corn
All of these sides were great but my favorite of the bunch was the Mac and Cheese. I don't remember what my other dinner companions ordered but I do remember they all said they loved what they had.
To wash down all this great Bobby Q, we all had huge glasses of their house made sweet tea, which was super sweet and delicious.

Even though everyone was full, we all decided to share a slice of their Sub Zero Banana Cream Pie for dessert. This pie was served ice cold and was more like a piece of banana cheese cake than a regular banana cream pie. This pie had an amazing banana flavor and was topped with lots of caramel sauce. To our surprise, after we finished the pie, our server brought us some home made complimentary cinnamon sugar donuts. These little things were wonderful, I just wish I would have been a little less full so I could have enjoyed them more. 

The service and prices here were both great. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. Since it was our first time there he really helped us out by making suggestions and telling us what their most popular dishes are. The prices were very reasonable seeing that you get so much food.  

If your a fan of BBQ then I guarantee you will be a fan of Bobby Q. If you ever visit Phoenix you have to check this place out."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow asked for a 3 rib combo and manager made it happen and that was after he took care of two apps since we were seated 15 mins late.  Totally unnecessary but very appreciated!  Kristin our server was unbelievable and Taylor the manger checked on us 5 times during dinner.  If I could give 10 stars I would."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place last weekend and I'm so glad that we did. Their food was great and so was the service. My husband ordered brisket and ribs and he was in heaven after he finished eating. The portions of food are very decent for the price. We will definitely be going back to this place again. If you're a fan of this type of food then I definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"This is the best Restaurant in AZ. Every food is to die for. Their baby back ribs are so moist that the meat just falls out in your mouth and best baked potatoes with everything. We took my friend parents for the First Time last night and they said everything they ate was so good that they were so quiet enjoying every bite of their dinner. And the atmosphere was perfect as always. And in the Summer their opening s new Bobby Q's in Mesa much closer to us woo hoo"}
{"text":"The food was very good! The service was awesome!! The waiter Dylan took very good care explained everything to us on the menu and was very knowable with everything on the menu. The manager Jason was also awesome he came to our table several times and took very good care of us!!! I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had.  I come here every time I'm in Phoenix. 

Q Rolls (Pulled Pork Taquitos with glorious chipotle dipping sauce)
Cornbread (Unlimited)
Babyback Ribs
All sides
Bobby Q mini doughnuts

Service always friendly and attentive.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food was very good. We had the \"Whole Hog\" split between four people and the meat was more than enough. The sides are small portions, probably the amount one person would get for meal. I did not like the \"St. Louis\" ribs they were a bit dry for my taste; however, my brother and dad said they were \"ok.\" The Baby Back ribs were delicious, they fell right off the bone and were moist. The brisket was also much better than the St. Louis ribs. They charge extra to get bread to use with the pulled pork."}
{"text":"For a barbecue restaurant It is unusual to see an almost romantic setting. Bobby Q is unique in that way and several other ways. My wife is a vegetarian and there were not any entree options for her . Just side dishes which she has eaten  in the past .They started us off with there cornbread which was very tasty. I had the two meat entree with brisket of beef and the baby back ribs. My 2 side dishes were   a baked potato and the smoked baked beans which had  pieces of bacon and brisket in it. Very tasty.The brisket was a thick cut with a little barque sauce. Very tender and flavorful. The baby back ribs were so tender, I cut the meat at the bone and there wasn't a piece left on it.This was the first time I ever ate baby back ribs without getting sauce all over my hands and face. The ribs were succulent. We didn't want any desert but our waitress sent us away with these mini donuts which were warm and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. My wife loves warm baked goods.The experience we had was very good. Bobby Q passes the barbecue test with flying colors."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner last night. It was our first time here, but we wanted to try a new place and after seeing the reviews (and how many reviews) we had to try it. We were both beyond impressed. There wasn't a wait since it was a Monday night, but I could see it being packed on a weekend. 

We ordered the Q Rolls appetizer and each got a cocktail. My boyfriend said his tasted a little weak but overall they were both very tasty and mine was not weak. I had the Peach Tea and I can't recall what his was. The Q Rolls appetizer was absolutely amazing. I can't recommend that enough.

For the entree, we decided to go with Whole Hog Heaven because we had no idea how huge it was. We got baby back ribs, beef ribs, rotisserie chicken, beef brisket, mashed potatoes, mac n' cheese, and shoestring fries. 

Right after we ordered, two pieces of cornbread came out with a side of butter. This was SO delicious. Shortly after, our meal came out. Let me say again how HUGE this was. I tried to pick up a piece of brisket with a fork and it was so tender I couldn't pick up the whole piece at once. I specifically wanted the baby back ribs originally as they're my favorite and they were easily the best I've ever had. Meaty and tender with an amazing taste. I suggest asking for some extra BBQ sauce for the table but the meats are delicious with or without it. 

There was so much extra that we both have enough for lunch and probably even dinner tonight. I'll be eating lunch soon and can't wait! 

They brought out a piece of ice cream cake for my birthday (vanilla ice cream with chocolate cake and a walnut fudge icing). Delicious but I was too stuffed to eat more than a few bites of it. 

After we paid, they brought us a little bag of these mini cinnamon sugar donuts which I tried this morning with breakfast. Very tasty especially considering they were next-day donuts. 

The service was great throughout the whole meal. Unfortunately I forgot the server's name but she was quick and attentive. Needless to say, we were very pleased and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service!  Make sure you make a reservation, otherwise wait time on a Thursday evening was almost 2 hours."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is wonderful, service is great (people are so nice), and the food....the food is delicious. I tried all the meats and they are all so tender and tasty. Decent selection of mixed drinks and beer too-overall, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Boasts excellent BBq. My daughter loved the baby backs but I am a little more difficult to impress. Family friendly which is always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"BBQ is not easy and this place does it right, but it was overpriced. I left full and satisfied, but this is too much of a nightlife atmosphere and they seem to try hard to create that atmosphere, BBQ first, atmosphere second."}
{"text":"really too good to try anywhere else. i think i will go somewhere else and give 'em a try, then the disappointment when they do not come close has sealed the deal for me. i will only do bobby q for bar be que from now on. 
until they slip up or something goes amiss i will give them my loyal patronage. they didn't even mess up a take out order, so any and every is top notch here in my little tasty intake. yummy in my tummy and that's a big tummy!"}
{"text":"Really good barbeque we had the Sunday family feast for$39.00 with a couple of extra sides my daughter had chicken fried chicken we loved it all"}
{"text":"Another awesome find on Yelp!  The food is amazing. Hard to decide what to eat it all looked so delicious. My wife and I ended up getting the bbq chicken and ribs and sharing. 

The crispy onion rings had a nice chipotle kick to them. To top it off they give you cinnamon sugar donuts complimentary. 

Great atmosphere. Friendly wait staff. Ate outside on the covered patio. Which is great in February when you are from Chicago."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely delicious. There were a couple items we ordered that were not my favorite...but that's not to say they didn't taste good....just personally wasn't my favorite. The brisket was my favorite hands down. Meat is so tender almost melts in yours mouth. The baby back ribs had the bones falling off them when we were putting them on our plate! The beef ribs were more bone then meat and the meat was a little tougher...still had good flavor and I am glad we tried them but won't be ordering again. For the sides the mac and cheese was thick and my favorite...along with the mashed potatoes and we ordered gravy on the side! Yum! The pecan coleslaw was on point. The ranch beans were my least favorite item, the beans are a tad on the firm side and the sauce wasn't as sweet as I was thinking it would be. Maybe because of the ranch...won't be ordering again but also glad we tried them. The corn bread at the beginning was super tasty and the mini doughnuts at the end reminded me of back home MN state fair doughnuts!!! Overall, loves this place. A couple managers came by to check on how everything taste and I want to say maybe even the owner! I am not sure though I didn't ask him if he was....the waitress and the waiters were all on point. Awesome experience! Will be back!! :)

P.s. almost forget about the sausage! Perfect! The sauce on them was little spicy but just the perfect amount! That was my second favorite next to the brisket!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and excellent food. Our server, Paloma, was attentive, cheery and helpful with recommendations. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Super yummy and great servers.corn bread is my fave, and the little donuts they give are perfectly sweet."}
{"text":"Nope never again. Make better BBQ myself.  They get two stars because the wait staff was excellent. All the BBQ is sickingly SWEET.  4 different meats on the platter and everything covered in it. Very one note.  Rib meat frll off the bone way over cooked, dry and pretty tasteless.  Brisket would have been good if it wasn't smothered in sugar.  My sangria was weak. They give you fresh made doughnuts as a thank you, nice touch, couldn't eat them doughy.  I don't mind spending over 100 dollars for a good meal, i just felt robbed!"}
{"text":"Great place for meat lovers!  My friend ordered the rib combo and I had the 14 oz. medium rib steak with two sides -- Mac & Cheese and Roasted Corn.  The succulent steak hits the spot with every bite!  You can't go wrong.  Bobby-Q used to be known as Bobby McGee.  

Go Bobby-Q!!!"}
{"text":"Been by this place for years on the 17, but never stopped in. My girlfriend went for lunch months ago, said it was good. We ended up being in the area, and decided to grab dinner here. 

Building is very cool, like an entrance queue to a ride at Knotts Berry Farm. Dig it. 

For a Wednesday night, this place is super busy, which is a good sign. Even better when I can get a table immediately because I don't care where I sit! 

Being a KC native, I'm very skeptical of BBQ west of the Rockies. I haven't had anything to knock my socks of anywhere in the Southwest. The menu here is huge, which is also a drastic departure from any BBQ place I've ever been to. Prices are definitely on the higher side, too. 

Ordered Q-Rolls to start, based on our server's recommendation, which were actually very good. Brisket wrapped in puff pastry, I could easily eat a manhole sized plate of these things. Awesome. I had the brisket platter. Brisket was good, definitely delivers, but not in my top 10 brisket adventures. With the excellent ranch beans and so-so mac and cheese, it was solid, but not worth $20, as portions are on the smaller side. Others at my table said the same about their ribs and chicken, too. 

Spicy sauce was served in a stainless pitcher, and was very forgettable. Good BBQ sauce is tough to find anywhere (especially since most, even Gates as of late, are just HFCS infused sugar shit these days), but Bobby's sauce was neither spicy or tasty. 

Beer is served in actual pint glasses (which I haven't seen in years), not the 12 oz. \"pint\" glasses we've all become accustomed to. Nice touch. 

Service was OK. Food came out reasonably quick. Manager checked in with us 2-3 times, which seemed a bit odd, but nice to see that leadership is engaged at this place. Or maybe our server was in the doghouse, unclear!

We basically decided that, while we dug the building, the service was decent and the food was OK, there really isn't any reason to come back since the value isn't there."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the valley. Smoked pulled pork is delicious. Baby backs to die for. Prim Rib is spectacular. Plus they give you mini donuts!!"}
{"text":"They do charge a cover after certain hours. It is a nice and little known place to dance in the West Valley without going to Westgate area"}
{"text":"Very good service and very good food. The place is nicely decorated and the whole meal is affordable. The food is very tasty and very well cooked.

As a French, my only regret was on the chicken: although the sauce was very tasty, I believe that the quality of the meat was rather poor. But I guess it is complicated to find a good \"poulet fermier\" (free range chicken) in the US ;-)"}
{"text":"Yet another great dinner at Bobby Q's. We have two favorites to take out of town guests to eat and this is definitely one of them. The brisket is lean, tender and tasty. The roasted corn, excellent. The Q Rolls...yep! Had the fish for the first time and it was above average, so I might stay to the beef and cow. After all, this is a barbecue joint. Also, I won't give away the after dinner treat, but those are AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Man, I'm from Nebraska and know good smoked meat. This place was amazing.  Ribs were so awesomely tender and smoked that I was in heaven. I ate at the bar and the waiter \"joe\" was top notch.  What was even more amazing is that my food literally came within 5 minutes.  Faster than McDonalds :-). Bobby Q knows how to BBQ!!"}
{"text":"This place is really really good, but a little expensive as far as barbecue goes which is why I'm giving a 4 star as opposed to a 5 star. The service is TOP NOTCH too. Seriously- the service is amazing and I've never had a bad waiter or waitress and they are always super attentive. 

I haven't ever gotten anything I didn't like either.. thinking about their ribs is making me want some right now! The house made complementary donuts at the end of the meal are a really nice touch!!!"}
{"text":"We drive by Bobby Q's all the time, and comment how so and so said it's good - we should try it. Well, we finally did.  Long time Phoenicians will remember this as the old Bobby McGees with costumed, singing waiters.

It's a rustic-looking, galavanized tin building with lots of tangled plants growing around it under what is one of the last stands of eucalyptus trees in the valley; it's cool - makes you feel like you are some place else.

I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in.  I didn't know what to expect, and the decor is more elegant than I would have expected, yet with shabby chic touches.  Some tables have chairs on one side and banquettes on the other - something different.  It's very pretty.

The menu is pretty standard for a barbeque place.  I went straight for the baby backs (half-rack, $16.00), my favorite.  Hubs ordered two meats ($17, I think) pulled pork and beef brisket.  Our waitress was nice, but a little unpolished, very valley-girl, yet helpful and attentive.  She plopped a basket with two round pieces of cornbread and whipped butter on our table - delish cornbread.  Beer comes with a frozen glass - a nice touch. 

He ordered a wedge salad - generous helping of chunky blue cheese over ice berg lettuce with bacon and onion strings.  

Sides are standard - shoestring fries that aren't really shoestring, beans, mac and cheese, pecan coleslaw that we almost tried.  We both got the fries and beans. Beans have a little bit of meat in them, and a bit of zip, but are nothing outstanding.

The ribs, however, were superb.  I put my fork in between rib one and two and the first bone basically fell on to my plate.  I had to nibble the meat off only a couple of the bones - other than that it melted off the bone.  The flavor was perfect - the meat flavor comes through the not too sweet, not too tart, smoky sauce.  

Hubs thoroughly enjoyed his pork and beef as well.  The sides were so, so - we will try different ones next time.

We were too full for desert, but received two little - fritters or donuts (couldn't understand the valley-speak) in a paper bag to go.  Fished them out and ate them - little bits of heaven right there.

We will definitely be back for ribs.  It's a very pleasant, dressy casual restaurant and, a plus, it's on the west side!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ! I got the lunch platter of St. Louis ribs amazing. Pork- the softest most tenderest pork, chicken BBQ was ok, still good but lower on the list. The QLina pork burger was sooo tender and juicy.  The fries were thin , crunchy, and and flavorful 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Best BBQ we've had. The meat falls off the bones. The butter corn and the Mac and cheese are legendary. Even their beer is perfect with the BBQ. Go for amber ale. Best part is Ashlyn, best waitress. She really reads our minds and made our experience so much better! Ask for Ashlyn if you are here!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bobby Q's 4 times now and always have gone at Happy Hour. Why? Because it has a nice little menu. Today, two of us ate 3 appetizers and the bill was $14.

This is my go-to spot for West Phoenix (I live in Chandler). Depending on your goal Bobby Q's has it - nice bar, nice restaurant, and nice club on the side.

Club: I've gone to the club twice now on Friday (not sure the hours). Earlier in the night it is rather interesting (in a good way). The way that I describe it as - someone brought in their iPod and put it on shuffle. They play country, hip-hop, rap, alternative, oldies, rock, and disco all in one sitting. This makes for an interesting dynamic as many people who want to dance to Toby Keith's \"I love this bar\" probably don't want to dance to the follow-up song of Soulja Boy's \"Kiss me through the phone.\"

Except me of course - I stay and dance to whatever is playing.

With that said, the crowd is generally older. I was boogying down with a lady that was 70+ and having a ball. Later in the night (read: after 10pm) the crowd changes to an urban crowd and has a crowd that is complimentary to that music."}
{"text":"Defiantly worth the hype! For drinks I ordered the sangria and my Bf got the two IPA's on draft.  My sangria was good came in a glass mason jar.  My boyfriend enjoyed both IPA's. 

Appetizer we ordered the Q ROLLS tasty deep fried brisket with a Bbq dipping sauce and spicy dipping sauce as well-I enjoyed the bbq as it was a little sweet how I like it!

Main course we split the prime rib & bbq chicken combo.  Combo comes with a potato and two sides.  We ordered the MAC AND CHEESE and OH MY GOD it was prob the best Mac and cheese I've had in a while---five stars alone!!!!. The other side was the veggies...eh wasn't a fan . The veggies they chose were onions? Squash and peppers, to me that just wasn't what I was expecting- I had in mind broccoli or cauliflower? Seemed like an odd choice 

For  dessert we ordered the mud pie to go !

As a bonus they give you some homemade donuts for the road ( I was too stuffed but my bf said they were amazing)

Overall good pick, good music, and good service! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Jesus. I had heard about this place and seen it while driving on the i17. I finally stopped in and my god.... 

I got the bbq pulled pork sandwich with a side of grilled vegetables. Delicious. Just pure delicious. I got to sample the macaroni, and I must say it does indeed live up to the hype... The creamy, cheesy goodness doesn't disappoint. Even the cornbread with butter was delicious and its complimentary!!

To wash it down I ordered the bobby q amber ale, and it was more than up to the task to compliment my meal. 

If you're on the fence, like bbq, or just want a nice atmosphere do yourself a favor and stop by Bobby Q's. You're going to like what you ate. I guarantee it."}
{"text":"I had a great experience for my first time at Bobby Q. The vibe seemed family-friendly but still quite lively. It's a spacious restaurant with plenty of room for large parties and there's also a full bar so you can order from their drink menu or have them make whatever you want. 

Our table ordered baby back and St. Louis ribs, brisket and sausage. Entrees come with sides so we got a few of them. The sides were ok, nothing special. The BBQ was pretty good. The brisket was almost too soft though, crumbling into smaller pieces as we picked at it. But it tasted good, smokey and flavorful. My favorite, surprisingly, was the sausage. And it was perfect with their tangy Carolina BBQ sauce. We also ordered appetizers, spinach dip and these brisket-filled egg rolls. Spinach dip was good that came with really garlicky garlic breads, so that was good. And the brisket rolls are their most popular appetizer for a reason. 

The food was good but it was really the service that impressed me. Even with how busy they seemed the food came out very fast. Our server, Julie, took the time to explain things to us and was very attentive and patient. The icing on the cake is that they bring out donuts for dessert! Warm, sugared donuts. So good and that was such a nice surprise. Good eats that was reasonably priced and we were treated very well. I'm coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Bobby Q is a great choice for dining in Phoenix...great all around menu and great atmosphere...super busy place so it's not a bad idea to get reservations...we waited at the bar and had drinks on a Friday night as it was super packed...the bag of doughnuts they give you on the way out is a nice touch..."}
{"text":"Best ribs in town!  Family restaurant and also romantic.  Fun bar too.  Great place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix and saw this place on Yelp.  Didn't really think AZ was known for bbq but decided to give this place a whirl. The bbq was surprisingly yummy.  I had the baby backs and spicy sausage. The bbq wasn't drenched in sauce which is how I like it. Huge portions and very reasonable prices. Their cinnamon sugar donuts at the end of the meal are so addicting!  Friendly staff as well with lots of seating."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Arizona we have to make a visit to Bobby Q's. Food is always so good. We made reservation and were seated a couple minutes after our reservation time. Our waitress was awesome and we got our food pretty fast considering it was pretty busy."}
{"text":"While I haven't written a ton of reviews on here I reserve five stars for an establishment that is truly outstanding, and Bobby Q fits that bill.  When an appetizer alone is so delicious that I would (and have) drive the 30 minutes from my house to get them speaks volumes.  

Q-ROLLS!  Q-rolls are ridiculously delicious by themselves but when you add the sauce that it comes with its another level.  I have sincerely come here just to get two orders of these because they are that good.  They have ribs for every type of person.  I'm a fall off the bone rib guy but people I've dined with there are not, so Ive tried various types of ribs and each one were fantastic even though the baby backs were my favorite. 

The wait staff have always been top notch and stellar with their recommendations and attention.  My ONLY complaint is that they are so far away but that isn't their fault.  I beg of you Bobby of the Q open another location!  Regardless of distance Its an amazing restaurant that I would find a way to visit even if it was on the moon."}
{"text":"went to bbq's today and it was great, service was on point, atmosphere was great. our waitress was nice a very good, the only reason why I didn't give a 5 star is because the ribs was a little to salty to my taste, maybe is the dry rub but the ribs were very soft and tender. bbq jumbo potato was excellent.  I will go back again to try other items."}
{"text":"Some of the best ribs I've ever had have come from here. Their sides are awesome too, especially if your a fan of macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"First time eating here. We split the three meat with the two of us and it had great flavors. The bbq was so good  I am glad we stopped in. Our sides were the Mac n cheese and pecan Cole slaw - we were intimidated by the pecans but I barely even tasted it. Great mix!"}
{"text":"This may be some of the most mouth watering, deliciously smoked meat and chicken I've ever eaten. Our waiter Wes was the Best!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable.  Our 1st time at Bobby Q's, the last night of vacation and we couldn't have been more impressed. 
Our waitress (Christen?) started things off right with her friendly and warm style.  When my date wanted to know which sides were best, Christen brought out huge samples of the sides we were interested in.  Our glasses were never empty and our table was consistently bussed.  We chose the smoked wings for an appetizer and since we come from the \"wingland\" (near Buffalo, NY) we were not disappointed.  Big, meaty wings that were slathered in sauce and cooked perfectly.  We opted for small Caesar salads and were surprised.  The romaine was cold and crisp and the dressing was as good as any at many a high-end restaurant we've been to. Cornbread.  Damn, that cornbread was GREAT.  Then entrees:  I had the 3 meats: sausage, brisket and chicken.  Each was perfect.  Smoky, tangy and tender.  The brisket may just be the best I've had.  My date had the prime brisket and raved about it.  I was only offered the tiniest of samples from her but was amazed - that WAS the best brisket... ever.  At the end of the meal we remarked how terrific everything was (especially the cornbread) and asked for a box to take our remaining pieces to-go.  We were surprised when Christen brought out a box with an additional 6 pieces.  I had ordered the Sub Zero banana cream square to-go.  I was asked if it was ok for it to come out a little later, as the manager invited us back to the kitchen to look around and specifically to see the industrial-sized smokers.  That was an incredibly gracious gesture.  I even got some meat smokin' secrets out of him!  Again - a warm, friendly, gracious guy with a genuine smile and offered a feeling of being \"family\".  By the time we got back to the table my huge desert to-go was ready and we were fat and happy.  Christen ended our night with a warm (and strong) handshake and best wishes for safe travels, home."}
{"text":"No need to go into full details but let's say I had the mutha f&$&in best FOOD COMA lol.  The service is incredible and the food again... Just keep in mind FOOD..... COMA.  

Oh yeah a very very good recommendation is to get RESERVATIONS before you go.  You feel like VIP when everyone just waits outside hoping to get a seat.


Thank you BOBBY Q's"}
{"text":"Awesome service from the waitress. Drinks just kept coming with out having to notify them. Awesome hot food, I ordered the catfish with mac n cheese with a loaded baked potato. The fish was nicely battered and tasted AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Favorite BBQ place to go! 
 I had the lunch platter, which was St. Louis ribs, BBQ chicken, and beef brisket. Oh my lord, was it so heavenly good. As good as it looked. The brisket was my favorite, so tender and flavorful. All the meat just falls off the bone, so soft and dee-licious!
Can't forget to mention their mac n' cheese, so creamy and cheesy, best mac n'cheese in the world! I might be reaching, but I promise you it was oh so good! Also we loved the cornbread. Cute little patties is how they come out, and we can't tell you how those little donuts they serve after each meal, how tasty those little things are, a little sweet and crunchy on the outside, soft and doughy on the inside. We loved this place so much, we came back the next day for dinner, seriously! I'm pretty sure you'll love it too."}
{"text":"I first walked into this restaurant very unaware of its culture and cuisine. It was the closest restaurant to me when I was working as an intern a couple of years ago and so my roommate and I went one Sunday afternoon. We were quite surprised to come across this quite elegantly themed restaurant amidst a not-so-great neighborhood. The interior of the restaurant has a darker, vintage vibe to it and the outside patio is beautifully lit and adorned with a waterfall and misters for those infamous Phoenix summer days. The food experience was the fun part. We opted to for the Whole Hog which is a selection of three different meats of your choosing and three sides. We had the pulled pork,  the sausage, and the brisket. By far, the sausage there is the best sausage I've ever had. Might I add, prior to them serving our main dish, they bring out complementary corn bread that is second to none. I recommend this restaurant for anyone wanting to impress on a date or any company wanting to host a business meeting."}
{"text":"Look for the sign!
Found myself in Phoenix for a weekend vacation. The main purpose was to check out the grand canyon and catch a baseball game but I ended up finding one of the best BBQ joints in the country. After trying Memphis, Carolinas and Texas BBQ...the last place i expected to find great BBQ food would be in the desert. I noticed the big sign while driving down the highway and decided to go in. Its an upscale kind of atmosphere...well compared to what you find in Texas. Nice patio for dining when its not to hot. We got the 4 meat platter...and it was some of the best BBQ I have ever come across. I only wish they had one in Jersey. The have some great appetizers and mixed drinks in pineapples as well. Good wait staff, great mac n cheese too!! TRY IT"}
{"text":"so we were from LA and somehow suddenly found the appetite for some good BBQ. While Phoenix is not known for its BBQ, we tried it out anyways, knowing that we're all hungry and could carve out any meat given in our direction.

we were dead wrong! we were expecting it to be another overrated and overpriced Lucille's BBQ down in California but oh my, we found a gem in Phoenix. We ordered the three meat platter and oh boy, it was good. me and my gf shared the platter, we got the st louis ribs, the brisket and the pork. the ribs were great, it falls off the bone and it's so juicy and tender. one of the best ribs i ever tasted, period. the brisket were unbelievable. smoked right, you'll taste every flavor of it. salty, meaty, and juicy, we were all happy just to be there at that time.

if you visit phoenix, make sure to visit BOBBY Q as it will never let you down!"}
{"text":"The thing I love most about BobbyQ is their service! The staff is very friendly and attentive! Their ribs are honesty the best around Phoenix!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Free cornbread, LOVE. Free mini-donuts at the end of your meal, LOVE. 10% off thanks to yelp, LOVE! My friends and I always get the Whole Hog Heaven. It's the most bang for you buck for sure and then some! I've tried all sorts of different combinations and would recommend everything EXCEPT the chicken, it was a little too dry for me. And ALL the sides I've tried are delicious: corn, mashed potatoes, shoe string fries, mac n' cheese...perfect! The Q rolls appetizer are a must-get appetizer with the Chipotle sauce! Service is always great too! 

The Q Lounge next door seems like it would be a fun place to go post meal as well. We didn't go but it looked like it was bumpin' and they played some good music!"}
{"text":"I'm sure it's been said nearly a thousand times before but this may very well be the best bbq in AZ. I'm a native Texan and used to eating some good Texas bbq but this is something to write home about. Jake our waiter states that they smoke their meats for 18 hours. The food tasted every bit like they did. I could really taste the smoke flavor with the sausage which they filleted open to soak up the flavor. I can tell you that it tastes like they use pecan and mesquite wood for smoking. I've passed this place thousands of times and smelled the fresh wood smoking and my only regret is not coming here any sooner. If you're bringing a group make sure to try the whole hog heaven. It's more than enough food for three people. The food was every bit worth the price!"}
{"text":"We are visiting for Denver and came here from the Yelp reviews. We both had the pulled pork and it was absolutely delicious. The smoked meats were cooked perfectly and sides we filling. This was a great find and we most definitely recommend this restaurant. Oh, by the way the donuts at the end.... OMG!"}
{"text":"\"I LIKE PIG BUTTS and I cannot lie\"

When visiting a new city, I try to eat things we don't have in Hawaii. Good BBQ is one of them so I'm no expert, but this place was so finger-licking-I'm-on-vacay-screw-my-diet good! Since we only had one shot to try everything, we tried the sampler:

WHOLE HOG HEAVEN $48
2 choices of ribs (we got baby back and St. Louis, I would get double baby back next time)
2 choices of meat (we got pulled pork and brisket, totally would get that again)
3 sides (we got roasted corn, beans, grilled veggies, but the shoestring fries were also very good)

KIDS MENU too! The kids had the chicken strips (which is like the breaded processed kind you get in the freezer), which they absolutely enjoyed because it is familiar to them. The key to a good kids menu is to offer things kids like (not mini versions of the adult food), and they do very well here. (We also ordered the appetizer chicken tenders, which is more like real chicken, real batter and they didn't like that as much.)

BBQ sauce- when asked if we wanted extra sauce, (regular or spicy?) I asked for both. I thought they'd bring little containers but hallelujah they thought of everything-we got little coffee pots of sauce brought to the table. Try the meat first before you drown it with sauce because it really needs no sauce! But I love sauce. I dipped the fries in it, the corn in it, the beans in it, I love good sauce. We (or I) emptied both pots of sauce, but TRY THE SPICY sauce! It's not that spicy and was delicious!

Service was great, and the little things like complimentary cornbread cakes and cute freshly made on the spot \"THANK Q\" cinnamon sugar donuts was a nice treat! 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best BBQ I have ever eaten! I had the baby back ribs! I can't wait to come back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were going to Bobby Q's to enjoy ourselves for his friend's birthday but the night turned out horrible.

First off, we paid for a table and they made us wait until 10:45pm to even get our table when they told us to be there by 10PM, then one of their waitresses charged us for a water (which was NOT a water bottle) which are free from as far as i know and we gave her a 20 dollar bill and she never came back to give us the change. Then the security gaurd kicked us out for being \"too intoxicated\" we hadn't even had a drink yet! We were 100% sober because we hadn't even gotten to our table yet!!! He just randomly picked us out of the crowd and told us to leave saying my eyes were closed and it looked like i was falling asleep! How can i fall asleep while dancing? and how can i make eye contact with you if i'm sleeping? I couldn't believe it!! I asked to speak to the manager and then the security gaurd tried to say he was the manager when he clearly was an 18 year old kid trying to talk down to me. I will never go back to that club again. It was by far the worst experience i've ever had at a night life club and i do NOT reccommend ANYONE to go there! People don't waste your money here!"}
{"text":"Good food. I had the ribeye, it was delicious. The mac 'n cheese was very good, not mushy at all: just right. The corn was good, too good to be healthy (i.e. sweet and buttery).

My experience with the service was more of a mixed bag. I was waiting 10 mins before the waiter came. It was a minor thing but the manager put the appetizer on the house. Also I had ordered my steak medium-rare but the steak was closer to medium-well (the difference is the blood, medium-rare is a little bloody, medium is not). I mentioned it to the waiter and the manager put the steak on the house. Honestly, the steak was so good I did't care.

I would go again. 5 stars for the food, 4 stars for the service, and an extra star for effort."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!! I had the rotisserie chicken and bites of my husband brisket and ribs. The brisket is my favorite for sure! The mac and cheese is amazing and so is the roasted corn!! I gave a 4 star instead of a 5 because the services wasn't great, they were busy which I understand but the food is so good that I am sure they are busy all the time so the server should be used to it. The server was really friendly but we had to ask other servers walking by for things because our server wasn't coming back to check on us, we kept seeing him but he didn't stop. Again the food is amazing and I will definitely eat there again and recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Booby Q's baby back ribs are always prefect, very tender and the favor is the best! The ambiance is quite nice as well. The staff are always attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"The beef brisket is to die for . I had the Texas Beef Ribs and it was the best I have ever had and I eat a lot of BBQ ! I would def recommend all my family and friends ."}
{"text":"Here's my two cents...

We had an outstanding meal of baby back ribs and a pulled pork sandwich. I cheated and grabbed a bag of the \"Thank Q\" donuts on the way in instead of at the end because as they say, \"life is short...eat dessert first.\"

I want to go back but I live in another state. Next time!"}
{"text":"Best brisket ever! I've been here a few times and it never leaves me with feelings of disappointment! I love the q-rolls and the warm corn bread. If you are a party of 4 get the whole hog heaven! Delicious."}
{"text":"Spectacular.  Burger, Mac n chz, cornbread, fries, brisket, and free fresh mini donuts for dessert.  One of my favorites in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Holy Cow! How many times have you been for BBQ where the quality of the sides has been totally forgotten, not here! Seriously, best mashed potatoes I've ever had. Split the whole hog, 2 1/2 slabs of ribs, 2 piles of meat, 3 sides. Amazing, a bit past tender (fine by me) but perfect rub and sauces. Mac n cheese was crazy good. Staff and service was very friendly, restaurant was done very well, enough southern comfort without the hee haw cheese, no wonder it was still packed at 8:30 with people still waiting to be seated"}
{"text":"After all the glorious reviews this restaurant has, I had to check it out. I ordered the Saint Louis ribs, pulled pork and brisket. My sides were the beans and coleslaw.
The service was good, and the donuts at the end were good, the slaw wasn't bad either.
The rest of it was bad to terrible, the cornbread came out and it was mush, I couldn't pick it up and eat it, it fell apart in my hands.
 I thought what ever, the meat should be good. 
The main course came out, the exact same way, light brown clumps of mush, the brisket fell into little pieces and needed to be put in to a sandwich to be eaten. The pulled pork had very little taste. Next the ribs, the meat fell of the bones, a mushy mess, I had to eat them with a fork, because it was impossible to pick up a rib bone. I  only ate as much as I needed to feel not hungry,which was less than half. I had to eat the sides just because it was solid food. I will never go back there again, And considering the other complaints of  'mushy meat \"  on here  this wasn't a fluke, I felt I had to add to it. Total waste of money."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my family the other night and we had a nice time. I would definitely recommend making a reservation because they get SO busy especially on weekend nights. 

It is for sure likely going to be crowded and on the loud side, but it is a super fun environment. The restaurant is really big and it has a great Western theme. 

We were seated pretty quickly with our reservation. It definitely took awhile for us to be greeted and to get our first round of drinks. Our server mentioned that the bartender was really behind so that it might take awhile for our drinks. I felt bad for the bartender and it seemed like they should have had another bartender helping. They had also run out of many of their gins because it was the end of the month, but I felt like that shouldn't be an issue. However, their cocktails were tasty. 

Regardless, our server was super nice and friendly. She was very good and attentive in the beginning and then towards the end it was difficult to track her down for awhile. I think she had a really big party that she was taking care of. 

For starters, we started off with the recommended Q-rolls stuffed with brisket and served with chipotle sauce. These were delicious! They were crispy, not oily, and the brisket inside was tender and flavorful. 

For my entree, I got the fried chicken, with a baked potato and mac n'cheese. The fried chicken was very good--crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The baked potato was good--not overly oily. The mac n' cheese was very good too, but reminded me a lot of stouffer's mac n' cheese, which isn't a bad thing--just reminded me of it. The prime rib that I tasted was also very good--tender and flavorful.

The prices were fair.

Overall, really fun and casual ambience, good food, fair prices and decent service."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were SPEECHLESS. It was nothing short of PERFECTION. We were greeted by the friendliest staff, the food was beyonddd amazing. Everythibg is made from scratch so if you don't finish your food, expect to get the best quality left overs for the day after. We got the combo deal with two one half ribs two one half meats and three choices of sides. This is a one of a kind bbq place worthy of the travel and food networks. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"We saw this place on Yelp while visiting from Washington state! IM SO GLAD WE CAME!  Not only was the food AMAZING, but Travis our water was friendly and knowledgeable!! Highly recommend the Q rolls!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.  Stacy was our server and the best server I've had in a long time (I travel and eat out quite a lot). She guided us through the menu and was extremenly knowledgeable and friendly. To be honest, I had low expectations for a BBQ place but Stacy wowed us. I ordered the prime rib and baby back ribs for myself since I couldn't decide. It was the best decision I made.  The special sauce was delicious and Stacy gave a little bit of their original and spicy sauce. Everyone at the table was extremenly happy with dinner. We will definitely go there again if we come back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"It's so good it's not right!!! Unbelievable!!! We had the whole hog, best BBQ I've had in AZ yet. Meat fell off the bone, the pork was tender and perfect, the brisket was tender and perfect too. The Mac-n-cheese was unreal and the ranch beans were spot on. For dessert we had the banana cream pie...ridiculously amazing!!! I'm glad I live 42 minutes away from Bobby Q because I would pack on the lbs for sure. If you want great BBQ, excellent service, and a restaurant with unique character Bobby Q is a no brainer."}
{"text":"Great Bque in Phoenix! My friend and I stopped in Sedona for barbecue ribs and it was a total disappointment! So we were a bit hesitant on going to Bobby Q for dinner. The service was great! The ribs were just on point! Great food and ambience! Loved the pineapple splash!"}
{"text":"In Arizona some b&)tchen BBQ!!!! Saw the place on the fwy and jumped off to find the place...
Place if huge! If u mis this place please get ur eyes checked! Lol 
First impression was people leaving and telling us how good it was.. Two different parties! Man a place that makes people do that! 
We all ordered the sampler platter .. Three choices of meet and one side .. I ordered ribs, brisket and pulled pork..pulled pork cooks for 12+hrs .. Was good just a little to mushy for me.. Brisket was over the top for me! YUMMY!! Now the ribs.. I have traveled all over for ribs and this is hands down my favorite! My side was Mac and cheese as a recommendation and I have only had one better than this! I heard people taking about the potatoes behind us and how good they were ...  Oh yes did I forget to mention the corn bread! 
Look don't hesitate to come here! Your palette and ur stomach will love it!"}
{"text":"Service: We definitely had great service. Prompt attention from our server Phil and the manager stopped by. 

Decor: Country shabby clean. Dark woods, colors and Distressed textures; high ceilings made the place feel open and large.

Food and drink: Full bar; mediocre strawberry daiquiri & good virgin strawberry lemonade. The corn had great flavor along with the corn bread patties. Grilled chicken and ribs had decent flavor, a little smokey, very little char. .. The ribs were very tender but the chicken was a tad dry. Great smoked sausage and shoestring fries. The bbq sauce was tasty, not overly sweet and not to runny. Cinnamon donuts are a nice touch at the end of the meal.

Overall I would give it 3.5. It wasn't bad,  it just wasn't outstanding."}
{"text":"My first experience here was half good, half bad, and we left a comment card to reflect that.  The response I received was customer service at it's best.  The proprietor sent me a letter of apology along with a small gift card to replace the one item we had that wasn't terrific.  
I've now been going back for 3 years on a regular basis thanks to his response and attention to service.  EVERY time since the first has been exceptional.  From the food to the service to the beer - for singles, couples, and families - this place has the menu to make you drool.  It has even become my visiting friends \"must eat at\" restaurant in Phoenix.  
Favorite items so far are the juicy steaks or baby back ribs, and the melt in your mouth sweet cornbread.  YUMMMMMMMMMM"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ. Brisket is melt-in-your-mouth. Service is great too. Thanks Serena for taking care or us!"}
{"text":"Omg, best eating in Phoenix, AZ, pay a little more than usual for a plate however it will be well worth your money, for taste and portions."}
{"text":"Went here last week for a business lunch. Corn bread I'd fantastic. I had heard brisket sandwich and fries. All very good and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"My husband who doesn't like tomato saucy BBQ meat says it was the best BBQ meal ever because sauce wasn't sweet as some others he tried. Mac & cheese was way too creamy for my taste but corn side was good w/ smokey flavor. Their beef brisket is so tender, baby back rib falls off the bone so good. beef rib was also good but after trying different sides all of us ordered, if I ever come back to Phoenix, I will surely come back and order a baby back rib w/ mashed potatoes and roasted veggies with extra bbq sauce to dip the meat in. Excellent bbq!"}
{"text":"So I previously posted about hating this place. That day I was hangry and wanted some brisket but ended up at the club and not the restaurant. I recently went back and the food was amazing! I had the Q rolls which were out of this world and my entree was the 12oz sirloin. The steak was wonderful and the sides were delicious. I had the Mac and cheese and ranch beans. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Until Bobby Q's entered my life i wasnt a fan of BBQ anything! made me kinda sad to see so many people enjoying some messy ribs but anyways I i digress...This place has changed my life for the better!. Their St. Louis ribs are fall off the bone AMAZING! and their Mac n Cheese is a must have! I have to admit this place has made me a bit of a ribs snob, if something doesnt come close to Bobby Q's i automatically right that place off.

A short review but you get the gist of it..."}
{"text":"Winner winner bbq dinner.  Been here several times.  Everything has been pretty spot on.  Only thing I would pass on is the brisket pizza (and I love pizza) it's kinda dry and unnecessary.  Ribs, brisket, mac n cheese, burger, sausage, brisket, corn muffins are all delicious.  Never been disappointed here"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Phoenix so I wanted to try some local BBQ.  I decided to get take out from Bobby Q based solely on its reviews.  From the time I called to place my order to picking my food up, the staff was very friendly and welcoming!  They really seemed to care that my order was accurate and that I had everything I needed before leaving.  

The food was great!  I ordered a St. Louis rib rack with Mac n Cheese and Potato salad as sides.  They also gave me a couple pieces of corn bread with my order.  So not only was the food great, but the value for what you get is top notch as well.  I can't wait to come here again!

Verdict:  HIGHLY RECOMMEND - they do everything well.  If you're on the fence, try it.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"We picked Bobby Q's based on other Yelp reviewers. We were in town for the Mom Made Market in Scottsdale and wanted to take my husband out for some BBQ for his bday. We had reservations for 7:30 but came earlier and they sat us right away. Can't remember our waitress's name but she was so sweet and attentive. You get free cornbread with your order and they kept refilling it for us...my kids loved it! We got the spinach artichoke queso to start and it was amazing!!! Slightly spicy but not overly. Too spicy for my 7 year old but he's a wimp. My 8 year old loved it. My husband got the brisket sandwich with potato salad as his side. He says what makes a good BBQ place is how good their beef brisket is and their potato salad. (He's Texas born). He said both got 2 thumbs way up. They offer 2 sauces....spicy and original. The original was really sweet and the spicy not very but really good. I'd recommend that one. I got Bobby's salad and it had roasted chicken, goat cheese, apple, walnuts, cranberries, celery and came with a Dijon vingerette. It was so huge and so good. I hate when salads don't have very much \"stuff\" in them. Every bite was more than lettuce. It was so big and I couldn't finish it and even down to my last bite, plenty of chicken, cranberries and cheese. Both my kids got the kids BBQ sandwich with shoestring fries. I can't believe their meals were kids sized! Sandwiches had tons of chicken and sauce and a huge mound of fries. AND you get free warm cinnamon donuts at the end of your meal!!!!! If we are ever back in the Phoenix area, we'd definitely come again. Oh and the patio (where we ate) had lights stringed everywhere and a cool fountain. Great vibe out there. Perfect way to celebrate my babe's birthday."}
{"text":"I love Bobby Qs, their food is pooping amd always on point. Good atmosphere and clean. They nice."}
{"text":"Bobby Q is an excellent BBQ restaurant in Phoenix.  The portions are large and the food is tasty.  

We recently went and shared a rack of St Louis ribs, brisket, corn bread, mac and cheese, a smokehouse burger and fries.

The ribs and brisket were good.  The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious.  The corn bread was soft and fresh.  The fries were the perfect size.  But the best of the best was the smoke house burger.  It was a huge patty on an awesome toasted bun.  It came with shoestring onion stack, bbq sauce, and cheese.  Easily a top 5 burger in the valley.  

I recommend Bobby Qs to any bbq fan or burger fan.  Highly recommend the smokehouse burger."}
{"text":"Shut the front door, and sit down for the best baby back ribs you've ever sunk your teeth into. If you are in or from Phoenix, you are in BBQ luck. 

Take yourself to \"Whole Hog Heaven.\" It says you could enjoy this meal on your own; unless you plan to fast for two to three days share with a friend. Double down on some baby back ribs, enjoy some mac n'cheese, and save room for some complimentary fresh fried doughnuts for dessert (Or like me force them down with a BBQ covered grin.) Lot's of people rave about the Q-Rolls, however that was probably the only moot point for me. I'd recommend you save room for the meats.

By no means is a five star review for this place original, but I can only confirm that this place is still doing what everyone is talking about. Smoking some of the most delicious meats I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"While reading the free Glendale paper at a much-suckier restaurant I scoped a coupon for Bobby Q-$30 for two dinners, appetizer and dessert.  I figured what the heck, I've heard a lot of good things about this place, though I've been burned before it doesn't make me fear that fire :)  So me and a buddy went for some Q this past weekend.
This place is actually a lot hipper and nicer than the...umm....kinda crap neighborhood would make you think it would be...the entrance is not really well marked, we thought they were closed because we couldn't get in!!  We could be dumb though...
The brisket rolls were deep fried goodness, nothing wrong with that.  Chicken/rib combo was solid very moist, though I would have appreciated more smoke flavor.  And the spare ribs had that gristly-mini-bones-fatty-section action (though not unusual for untrimmed spare ribs)  The sauce and the sides (mashed potato and mac-n-cheese) were good and the portions are absolutely ENORMOUS!  I'm still eating their Q!!"}
{"text":"This was the last stop of a girls weekend before we all headed back home. Travis our waiter, was great at service and answering all our questions. The food was excellent. I will bring my family here when we return. I ordered the pork ribs, which were tender and not too much sauce on them. Our table opted to try all three sauces, all were good, but my personal favorite was the spicy one. The fries were a little too salty for my liking, which was probably a good thing since I didn't stuff myself with them. Unbeknownst to us, the meal ended with hot mini donuts rolled in cinnamon and sugar, all packed in to-go bags."}
{"text":"Worst customer service this evening!! Which was none. We sat at our table for 10 minutes with no server coming to our table. After a table behind us had people seated and within 2 minutes they had a server take their drink orders. We got up and left. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"i really enjoy this restuarant. but does anyone else miss bobby mcgees and its maze-like interior filled with would-be actors who honed their craft as servers? and there's nothing like scooping salad out of an oversized bathtub. that's all i'm saying."}
{"text":"Really liked this place.great atmosphere and fantastic service. I had the trio of baby back ribs, brisket and pulled pork. Topped it off with a side of Mac n cheese and pecan Cole slaw. Some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Dinner was very exquisite, the wait was about 20 minutes. The cornbread was amazing and the meat was very tender. Lots of beer choices"}
{"text":"WOW, should I say more? This was our first time here. My Son has Gluten allergies and was worried for what to order for him. Well, they have a full menu of GF items. The food was amazing. Service couldn't be better. Our server Jason had one ask: we had to let him know if anything about our food that we didn't like. We loved it all. On top of that Mgr stopped by to welcome us there since that was our first time. I can't wait to go back. You will love it. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Review for first time going to Bobby Qs - lunch on a Sunday. Ordered the pulled pork with a side of mac. Food was very tastey. The mac and cheese was made in house. It's all about the cheese sauce and there's was very rich without being greasey. The pulled pork was tender and not drown in sauce. I thought the serving would be a little larger a serving. The mac did not fill the bowl and the bun (not a roll) the pulled pork was served on was about the size of a McDonalds cheeseburger roll. It was piled pretty high, but it was 20% smaller than I pictured for the price. I ordered two brews service ice cold in a frosted glass. Service was quick and very good. I would go back again to try the platter. Just be really hungry or bring a bunch of friends because the people next to me ordered it, and it's a huge plate."}
{"text":"Before the food review, I need to praise our server, Edgar, who was efficient, adorable, and helpful.  The atmosphere is also really nice. The portions were adequate for the price.  Now.....

Good Q flavor is a fairly subjective thing.  That being said, well-cooked meat should be pretty objective.  The meats I had here, I wasn't real excited about.  

There's \"falling off the bone tender,\" and then there's mush.  I found ours to be of the mushy variety.  The mouth-feel was pretty weird.  We had the baby backs, pulled pork, and brisket.  There was not much outer crust, and that's what held what flavor the meat possessed.  Under that was lightly-flavored mush.  The baby backs had potential.......

Sides we had:  pecan coleslaw (\"we ran out of pecans\") - I liked it because it wasn't of the sugary-sweet-and-gloppy southern variety, and I could actually taste the cabbage.....mac 'n' cheese - ton of very creamy sauce that was on the bland side.....beans - pretty good, and I'm not a fan of BBQ beans, usually.....roasted corn - very buttery.....corn bread - flat disks that were of the crumbly-and-not-too-sweet type, as opposed to the cake-disguised-as-cornbread kind a la Marie Callenders.

I might go back for a burger...some cornbread....some of the little doughnuts served gratis at the end of the meal.....maybe not........"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Bobby Q for my birthday today. We had the lunch sampler platter. The brisket was very tender, the meat fell off the ribs and the chicken was awesome too. The sauce was very tasty - not a bunch of Southwestern spices which have no business being in BBQ sauce - like real sauce should taste. Garrett was a great waiter as he had the right mix of being attentive without hovering.  I received a birthday treat, thanks Taylor and Garrett, which was very chocolatey good. We will visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Great food!! Great service!!!! Amazing food(cornbread, brisket, mini donuts) and cute drinks!!"}
{"text":"Guys! This place is fantastic. I can't go anywhere else for steaks and ribs! 

Carmela, my server, was super nice and informative on restaurant and menu. Thank you dear!"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food. Owner was a nice guy. The ribs are perfect. Mac and cheese was thick and delicious. Brisket was perfect."}
{"text":"This is a nice place with a great patio. We ate indoors and I tried their \"Perfect Burger\" and it was honestly the best burger I've ever had. I don't know what's in their secret sauce but it's amazing. Try the fried onion crisps on the burger - delicious. My husband had the beef brisket and it wasn't his favorite (that's the only reason I gave 4 stars). But we both liked it enough to go back."}
{"text":"Some amazing BBQ!  You start off with corn bread that is really moist and sweet.  It's almost like eating cake.  We did the three meat platter and they split it onto two plates for us.  Don't bother with trying different sides, just get double the Mac n cheese...you won't regret it!  It's creamy cheesy goodness!  Brisket is really tender as well as the chicken.  Finish your meal off with some complimentary mini donuts in cinnamon sugar goodness and you'll have to roll out the door. Nice environment, good service and great food!  I know I'll be back for more when I come back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I think that you won't be able to find better barbecue. It is a little expensive but i think it is worth it."}
{"text":"I have neutral feelings about BBQ but this place was great.  I was dubious as we pulled into the parking lot.  I worried we accidentally wandered into a crack den.  However, once we found the front door, I was pleasantly surprised.  Super cute inside and a nice patio I'd love to visit when it's not 110 degrees outside.  The mac n' cheese was fabuloso and our waitress was fantastic.  My salad was a little bland but that is my fault for ordering a salad at a BBQ restaurant.  My dining companions were super pleased with their plates o' meat."}
{"text":"Oh my mouth-watering BBQ goodness. Ignore the sketchy neighborhood and 30 minute wait, because the meal is worth it! 
My boyfriend's favorite food is BBQ-anything so I left the ordering up to him (and the choice was easy): Whole Hog Heaven - 4 meat choices plus 3 sides. Settling on St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, BBQ Chicken, and Brisket, with sides of mac & cheese, coleslaw, and beans - he was as giddy as a kid on Christmas. I was pretty hungry too - and I had to admit the smell of BBQ wafting through the back kitchen door had my taste buds excited. The meal did not disappoint to say the least. The ribs were literally falling off the bone, the chicken was cooked perfectly, and the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender. All 3 sides were the perfect addition, however I do have to say that the coleslaw was my favorite, especially paired with the brisket. 
What sent us over the edge of BBQ heaven were the extra special additions before and after the meal. To start us off - homemade, warm cornbread with whipped butter. To finish us off - complimentary mini donuts (yes, you heard me right).
Erg I would give 5 stars, but there was a hoard of drunken girls taking over the bathroom (there is a club attached to the restaurant?) that I found fairly annoying. Oh well.
Highly recommended and we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Another great meal at Bobby Q Kristi M. services was awesome lunch menu was r reasonable the Q rolls are amazing. Unfortunately I'm on a diet wanted to bring my son someplace so I had a salad, which was good too."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food! The ribs, sides, and cornbread are great, plus they give you little doughnuts for dessert! They give you a great amount of food for the price, very reasonable. The environment is classy but still very comfortable. And the service is on point! Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable, plus we had a manager check in on us as well. Great place and we will be back!"}

This is the best place to eat in Arizona!!! Love the corn bread and beef brisket. The wings was one of the best too. Wil... See More"}
{"text":"Best Barbecue in AZ, quit reading this and go get some smokey ribs and steaks!!! Super smokey deliciousness, try the sangria (you're welcome) you also get homemade donuts for free to take home and enjoy later cause you have no room left in you're tummy from all the steak, baby back ribs, pulled pork and juicy chicken..."}
{"text":"Beef ribs were amazing. Tender and falling off bone. Just enough sauce. Sides of fries and coleslaw were solid. Corn bread muffin was a juicy and tasty. Great atmosphere and great food"}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere great drinks thoroughly enjoyed our meal and time at Bobby Q"}
{"text":"Great BBQ dinner on our last day of Phoenix vacation. Great staff - Ashlynn explained history of restaurant, how ribs and brisket prepared, and choices of sauces. Had a \"Whole Hog Heaven\" - which for our family was baby backs, St Louis ribs, and double order of smoked beef brisket. Tried two sauces - regular and spicy, which came to us in two small carafes for pouring. Sides included corn bread, roasted corn and ranch beans. Everything was tasty and we had left overs for part of lunch the next day. Ended with a death by chocolate dessert - which was two pieces of cake and a huge dollop of cream. Staff came by to replace empty drinks and refill water. A little dark inside so we were afraid to see what BBQ sauce stains were on our shirts when we left, but overall, a great place to dine."}
{"text":"Definitely a huge fan. I absolutely love the ambience and setup. Their service was fast and amazing. They serve tea that comes in these cute little boxes and they give you a select variety. They also give you home made cornbread with butter. 

I ordered the two meat platter which came with two sides. I ordered pulled pork and the baby back ribs. The ribs were probably the best I have tasted. I balanced the meal out with their grilled veggies and Mac and cheese on the side. Needless to say I was in the clean plate brigade that night. 

For dessert, you really need to try the mud pie. Very generous portion to either share or just feed that sweet tooth for yourself.

Overall I'm definitely a fan :) :)"}
{"text":"The service at this place is awesome! I've been here a few times for lunch and dinner and every time I come here I've always enjoyed the service. 

This place have the best BBQ by far in the Phoenix area!! The cornbread is excellent and I don't even have to mention the award winning Mac and cheese!!  

If you looking for a place to bring your family, friends, or significant other this is a nice place for a date or family gathering!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  I had the brisket sandwich and loved it.  They bring out fresh cornbread before the meal which is a bonus and small little donuts for after the meal.  The restaurant has a great decor and is a very pleasant atmosphere. If you want some good ol fashion barbecue- try this place out, you won't be let down"}
{"text":"Come here for the beef ribs but that's about it. Tried the sirloin steak, and pulled chicken but it wasn't particularly special or better than other places. The macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, and apple cobbler also did not stand out.

While you wait for your meal there's complimentary cornbread with sweet butter and honey. That was a delightful surprise. 

Service was outstanding! Our waiter was very patient and enthusiastic. 

The place itself, both its interior and exterior is extremely charming, reminds me of a classic Lousianan old bayou building. 

To be fair, I am comparing the barbeque I had here to the barbeque I've had in Texas. 

Don't forget to check in here for 10% off of your bill. And they give you free doughnuts on your way out!"}
{"text":"happy hour friday 4:30-8 can be a full crowd with no parking, park at carrington college! The free buffet at the q lounge is amazing prime rib, shrimp, tacos, nachos so good and bbq chicken will be going back friday with some friends!"}
{"text":"The food isn't overwhelming in portion size (I had lunch).  The taste was great bbq.  They could use a little flare in the sauce department in terms of variety.  The hot bbq sauce wasn't very hot.  

Price is reasonable and the service is good."}
{"text":"This was my third time here and though my previous experience(review) was horrible, my wife and I decided we would give Bobby Q's another try. We came for a late lunch/early dinner on Saturday(07/30) and were immediately sat. Our waitress, Bailyee, was enjoyable and tentative! This was a HUGE difference from our previous visit and waiter. We both ordered adult beverages and both were great. We started with the spinach and artichoke dip, awesome choice! My wife ordered the salmon which is a good size portion and she really enjoyed the flavors! I stuck with my favorite pulled pork, one of the best I've had. The food is great and Bailyee, our server is awesome!

Chef Mark, your staff redeemed themselves this time around. Please let Bailyee know we truly enjoyed her and wish she could be our server each and every time! We appreciate her stating to us we treated her very nicely and she decided to give us extra donuts as a token of appreciation. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is the best we had to wait because they're busy. But they came apologized and are giving us free desert. I always come here because they are courteous."}
{"text":"Went to Bobby Q with a work colleague and fellow BBQ enthusiast. We ordered two 3-meat combo plates so that we could try almost everything. 

All 3 ribs tasted good (baby back, st-louis, beef). I would have hoped for more smoke and more of a rub (we ordered them dry with sauce on the side). Of the three, I think that the St-Louis were the best.

We also had brisket, pulled pork and chicken. All three of these need lots of smoke (in my view) to be a success and there just was not enough. The brisket was not sliced and had no barque. It was more of a \"pulled\" format in small pieces. It tasted a bit dry and lacked smoke.

Overall, it's OK but not great. I'm stuck between going with 2 or 3 stars on this because the sides weren't all that fantastic either (mac & cheese, fries, grilled veg, ranch beans). However, it is still decent BBQ if you stick to the right items (ribs)."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful. Had Bob's salad. Hubby had brisket. Mac and Cheese is the bomb. Server Meghan was awesome. Very attentive and explained everything. Will be coming back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Short version: The food is delicious and the service is wonderful! 5 stars.

Long version: 

Ambiance: i was impressed with this restaurant as soon as we stepped in. It reminds me of the Lucille's BBQ chain in decor and ambiance - classy yet family friendly, with southern comfort and hospitality. Their menu even has a truck on the cover.

Service: Excellent. All of the waitstaff was attentive and courteous. Our waitress explained the history of the restaurant to us since we told her we were first time visitors. 

When our party of three told her we were planning on splitting a whole rack of baby back ribs, we assumed we would get a large plate of whole ribs and then three plates. Instead, we got three separate plates portioned with 3 equal parts of ribs and the sides distributed evenly as well. Such an unexpected and very much appreciated gesture, considering that ribs are messy enough as it is!

Food: AMAZING! 

Sweet Tea ($2): Refreshing and sweet, but not in excess.

Corn Bread (free): The only thing served that I didn't enjoy. If you like dense, oily cornbread \"patties\", this might be your thing.

Cajun Shrimp ($11): The shrimp is marinated in cajun seasonings and beer and it is accompanied by garlic bread. The slightly alcoholic flavor paired well with the shrimp and cajun spices and the garlic bread was buttery, crispy, and not overwhelmingly flavored.

Baby Back Ribs ($26): The best bbq I've ever had in my life! To be fair, I'm not a huge bbq connoisseur, but the ribs are succulent, tender, flavorful and the bbq sauce adds a tangy flavor. The meat falls clean off the bone.

Shoestring fries (comes with ribs): They are extra skinny and salted to perfection - my favorite type of fries. Scrumptious.

Mac & cheese (comes with ribs): Creamy, cheddary with a delicious consistency. The BEST kind of mac and cheese to accompany a rack of ribs.

Thank Q Donuts: When you leave, they give you fresh, warm cinnamon donuts - and a lot too! They gave us 6 for our party of 3. An awesome touch.

This will be my new go-to bbq joint from now on :)

Tip: If you check in with yelp or foursquare and tell your waitress, they will give you 10% off your entire check. Be sure to tell the waiter before you ask for the check!"}
{"text":"The claim is that they to have the best brisket in Phoenix, which couldn't be further from the truth.  Little to no smoke flavor, no smoke ring on the brisket, the sausage was burnt on the grill.  If this is the alleged best Phoenix has to offer......wow not!

Having been all over this great country and tried amazing BBQ, this fell way short."}
{"text":"This is our new brisket Q place. Oh my, so delicious!  We've tried several dishes and so far everything is so tasty that I can't pick a favorite yet:) this is my date night with the honey, and those craft beers are great. I love the big blue van..hope they bring on blue moon on draft soon."}
{"text":"My husband told me that Bobby Q is on the top 100s for best Barbecue in the US but I say top 10 and the best in the world for Mac and cheese! The service is always top notch! I have said before I never really liked smoked food but it's so perfect here and the barbecue sauce is so good! Thanks to the chefs and wait staff for another great experience! 






Okay 11 months later and once again had best BBQ meal. Heads down the best service in town the Manager was on the floor with a smile, very pleasant and making sure the customers were happy. Our waiter recommended an appetizer that was so good. I hope that more people will come try the Greatest BBQ in AZ!!!"}
{"text":"Great staff and best BBQ. We have business meetings here often. Always greeted with a smile. We like to go here on the weekends. Wait time is not long. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is now the must go to place when we come to Phoenix. We came across this gem last year when we were here for spring training and it was so good we had to come back again this year. The service is the best you can ask for. They are quick,friendly and answer any question you have for them. The food comes out very quick which is great since the smell of the BBQ everywhere has you craving your meal. We got the hog heaven which a sample platter of all the BBQ they have. We picked the ribs,chicken and brisket. All of them were excellent. Our waiter Justin was awesome and he recommend the banana cream pie which was had Bobby Q's twist on it. It was very refreshing and the perfect end to a great meal. Will definitely come back here every time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and our server was super friendly and nice and really helpful with suggestions. We split the q-rolls, a two meat platter of baby back ribs and brisket, which comes with two sides. We got mac & cheese and coleslaw. We also had their house beer. 

Everything was soooooo delicious. The q-rolls are not to be missed!! The ribs and brisket were amazing. They have regular and spicy BBQ sauce and both were sooooo good! Definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Rushed is the first thing that I remember from our experience at Bobby Q's ... from ordered to trying to take our plates to dessert ordering and the check.  The check, that brings me to another issue... we were a party of 3 (easy right?) so we ordered the big meal thingy (Whole Hog Heaven) and we split it and as a party of 3 (couple and a single) we asked the waitress with our check to use 1 card for a 1/3rd of the check and 2/3rds for the balance.  She pauses and says I will do it by your meals, I remind her that we ordered ONE BIG MEAL and need to split, she says \"OK no problem, I have a calculator back there...\"   Waitress and our check comes back and she did 1/4 and 3/4 to which I asked why and what the confusion was and while she was miffed, she offered to take the cards and re-do the charges, I declined this.  It's sad these are the things that were the most memorable of our visit.  BBQ was just \"OK\", over priced and really not that great given the \"we've heard this and that about this place\".  I will be in no rush to go back, it wasn't horrible ... it just wasn't great and add in the service issues, enough to go to other great BBQ options in the valley.  The corn bread and the donuts were really good, I will say that!"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate and my husband was in literal \"hog heaven\" all the meats were great, I split a simple ranch salad with him, which was good. Mac and cheese is ridiculously good and so was the service. Too full for dessert but had one donut and it was crazy good too!!"}
{"text":"BE CAREFUL OF YOUR CREDIT CARD, we had food there and we paid, left the restaurant and remembered that we did not get our credit card, went back to the restaurant, I showed the front desk girl where we were seated, she went and ask the waiter and said we don't have your credit card!!!!
I asked another girl who was very nice and she said I will help you find it and came back with the credit card.
I asked the front desk girl, did you check yourself? Did the waiter check before telling me you don't have it? She had no answer..."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered the Whole Hog Heaven. The meat was spectacular! Ribs were smoked to perfection, chicken was juicy, and the pork was great! The two suggestions we have are to make the tables for two a little bigger (would have been fine if we ordered something different), and provide moist towlets for cleaning your hands after eating the ribs. Those suggestions don't affect the rating I gave 'cause the food was just too good!
As for the service, our waitress was fast friendly and very informative! Next time I am in Phoenix I will be back to Bobby Qs!"}
{"text":"After my bf's graduation, him, his friends, his parents and I decided to have lunch here. This was my first time here but according to my bf this place is pretty good and he talked about it so many times that I thought I actually been here before. Well I finally got to try it.

I ordered the Platter since I really wanted to try more than just one type of meat if this is the only time I get to try it - so with the platter you get to select three types of meat plus one side. I ordered the beef brisket, bbq chicken (I requested the leg and thigh since I'm not a big fan of the breast) and sausage with the pecan cole slaw as the side. It also comes with corn bread. 

They served us all the corn bread in a basket first and it was the softest corn bread I've ever had but it had a soft buttery taste - kind of just melted in your mouth - I really liked it. When my platter came I was somewhat disappointed because they gave me ribs instead of the sausage - but it was alright because I ended up really liking the ribs. It wasn't a lot of meat but the flavor was good. What I really really liked was the beef brisket. It was the softest beef brisket I have ever had. It was amazing because it was so easy to chew and the flavor was also very good. The BBQ chicken was okay - I liked it just because I could request for dark meat pieces but it didn't really have that strong of a BBQ taste. The coleslaw on the other hand was my least favorite. It wasn't very tasty and it lacked dressing too. 

The services was pretty good - our waitress was friendly. The place itself was surprising dim - for a BBQ place and one thing I notice was usually when you step into a BBQ restaurant you would get hit in the face with a smokey bbq-y kind of smell however not here. When I stepped into the dining area - I didn't really smell any of that meaty bbq aroma - and not only that but my clothes didn't even absorb the smell of the restaurant. This isn't a good or bad thing - just an observation. 

Overall I really enjoyed my lunch - for 13.99 the platter was fairly priced since everything on the menu (from sandwiches to salads to platters) was ranged around 10-14 dollars a plate."}
{"text":"Food was great.  We really enjoyed the brisket... It melted in your mouth.  Our waitress, Shay was the best!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. My husband has been wanting to go for a while, and we finally went tonight.

Let's start with the positives (I'll apologize in advance for jumping around). We ordered the calamari appetizer ($12.50); we both enjoyed it. Hubby had the three meat combo dinner ($26) with pulled pork, beef ribs, and chicken. It came with 2 sides, he chose baked potato & beans. He liked it all and the few bites he shared, I liked too. I ordered the 10 oz prime rib dinner($26). It came with 2 sides. I wanted a side salad, so I got one side and $3 up charge for the salad (which she told me up front & I was fine with). The blue cheese dressing is great. Some of the lettuce was brown though, so that was a little off-putting. The prime was just so-so & I would not order it again. 

Now for the rest of the not-so-great part of our dining experience. It is rare that hubby and I get to go out alone together these days, so we were really looking forward to having a nice dinner out. Our server was a little over-zealous at first. It was our first time there so we were taking our time going over the menu. We ordered the calamari appetizer and asked for a few more minutes, again. She brought 4 warm pieces of cornbread to the table. She comes back a couple minutes later & this is where one thing that really bothered me, happens. I have my little plate in front of me and as I'm about to put a piece of cornbread on it, she takes it, puts it on a dirty plate from someone else's table - as I was saying, \"oh, I was still using that\", and she says, \"oh here, you can have it back\" and set it back down in front of me! I said, \"no, you can take it\". She didn't even offer to bring me another one. Now, I've been a server before & even when I was inexperienced, I would have NEVER done any of that. Very unprofessional. 

When we placed our order (this was right before the plate incident) things came out in timely fashion, but then it was almost like she disappeared. I didn't like the mashed potatoes, something tasted a bit off - like they used milk that wasn't good or something. It wasn't until I was about finished with my prime that she came back to check on us. I asked for a baked potato instead, and she was back in a flash with one. 

So overall, hubby was satisfied with his food. Me, not so much. Service, lacking. And, for probably the worst part of it all...about half hour into dinner the lounge area starts playing heavy club music. Not only is it competing with the country they have playing in the restaurant, but you can feel & hear the bass so much that it literally made us feel so irritated that we decided to take the rest of our food home. It was not a good dining experience for us. We probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Delisious. St. Louis ribs had a great smoky flavor but the baby back ribs were more moist. Mac and cheese was very good, had a lot of good cheese flavor without being greasy. Pecan cole slaw and ranch beans could have been better. Free cornbread and after dinner doughnuts were delisious. Not the best sauce I've ever had but definitely had good flavor, the 'spicy' sauce wasn't very spicy. Definitely going back since its right up the street but a little pricy for an everyday lunch or dinner, special occasions for sure. A must try if your around the Metrocenter area."}
{"text":"Great service, great drinks always at a good price music is cool.... but the main attraction.... THE TACOS!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I've been to in Phoenix. Everything there was top notch! Once seated the service is quick and friendly. Definitely a place that I will come back to."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of BBQ places and this is gotta be the best. Highly recommend this bbq, you wont be disappointed. Good cornbread, and meats were tender and smoked to perfection (we had the baby back ribs and brisket). Good max and cheese and the mashed potatoes were very tasty. 
Service was great and food was literally on the table 5 minuets after we ordered.
Cant wait to go back and try some more."}
{"text":"First time at this Bobby Q (we have been to the Mesa one before).  
Same outstanding food.  Had:
Baby back ribs - the meat fell off the bones.
Pulled pork - a little on the fatty side (normally we eat very lean meat) but just how I wanted it.  

Service was great as always, manager even stopped by to say Hi.

Bought some BBQ sauce to take home.

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My family went and it was the best experience ever!! The food OMG the food was so good. The wait staff was amazing. It really felt like home. I will definitely be going back thee. I highly recommend you check it out. Great home town feel. Best BBQ I have had sense my move from Illinois. A definite must go!!!"}
{"text":"I had the half rack of St. Louis ribs.  I thought the ribs were way over cooked.  Just to tender, to the point of being mushy.  The service was great.  The corn bread before the meal was very good.  I got mac and cheese and the pecan Cole slaw for my sides.  The slaw was blah, and to mac and cheese was ok.  The desert was an big.  I got mud pie ice cream, it was very good.  I will go back because the service was good alot with the atmosphere.  I will try a steak or fried chicken next time not the BBQ.  Oh and they give you doughnuts with your check!"}
{"text":"This probably the Best Beef Brisket I ever had!!! This is my second time here the last time I felt the same way and that was 7 years ago!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal at Bobby Q while in Phoenix for the week. It's tough to impress me with Q because of my long history of slow smoking meats in my ancient stick burner. 
I started the meal with the Q rolls appetizer, let me say these are brilliant and amazingly good!! They are basically brisket egg rolls that melt in your mouth, so light and crispy with a ton of flavor!! I ordered the three meat combo with Pulled pork, Brisket and Baby Back ribs, my sides were the beans and the Mac-N-Cheese. Brisket was super moist and tender as was the pulled pork, Baby Backs fell right off the bone but didn't taste over done at all. Beans were good, not over powering as some Q places can make them, they are simple and good. Mac n cheese was creamy and super cheesy, didn't finish them because I was stuffed to the gills by then!!  The little donuts at the end of the meal are so good, I wanted to take a bucket of them with me! Service was great as well, Jason was my server and he did an epic job as I never went without iced tea, food was out quick and he was the one that talked me into the Q rolls. If I lived here I would be a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"In these days of turmoil in the world and a rough economy, a place where you can go to feel the warm fuzzies, be cozy, and get good value for your money would be what you're looking for, right?   Well then, you have found it at Bobby Q.  And even non-carnivores can enjoy themselves.

The moment I got out of my car the seductive scents of smokey bbq wafted into my nose.  Winding through the patio with a bit of a ramschackle look with plants and tin and who knows else (but it's all for show), I enter the inner sanctum:  spacious and with dark walls, high ceilings, big paddle fans, and a bustling atmosphere.  A cheerful hostess greets my wife and I and takes us to our table.

The seating is comfortable, and the lighting is bright enough to read the menus but low enough to enjoy.  Our waitress, Tiffany, is a real joy.  She is very cheerful, checks on us just enough, and gets the orders correct.  She came out in short order and answers all our questions knowledgeably, and soon brings out the first golden nuggets of our meal: complimentary corn bread (they look like muffins without the tops).  They are delicious: very warm, melting in your mouth, moist, and with little pieces of corn in them.  The accompanying butter is hardly needed.

The menu, of course, focuses on meat, but for those inclined towards other proteins, there are other options: grilled salmon and shrimp  for example.  My wife order the baby back ribs with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies.  I got the grilled salmon, grilled veggies and pecan cole slaw.  I also had the \"homemade\" lemonade which came with free refills.  It was refreshing, but a bit on the sweet side.

I first got a side salad.  It was a decent size but basically iceberg lettuce with a few cherry tomatoes, croutons, shredded cheese and a little green pepper topped with red onions.  Warning: if you don't eat pork, they sprinkle bacon bits on top, which wasn't mentioned on the menu.  I got the blue cheese dressing, which didn't have lots of flavor but had real little pieces of blue cheese.

Soon the entrees came out, and they were good-sized.  My salmon was nicely seared and with a slight crispiness outside and very moist inside, served with a light sweet sauce on top.  The grilled veggies were green pepper, onion chunks, zucchini, and summer squash, served with a light vinaigrette.  Very tasty.  The serving size was about 1/2 cup.  The pecan cole slaw was good sized, with the right amount of mayo, and topped with the nuts (so if you are allergic to nuts, they simply can leave it off).  I wound up taking home 1/2 the fish and slaw and some veggies to make a lunch!

My wife finished off the 1/2 rack of ribs that she said just fell off the bone.  She took home some of the generous portion of mashed potatoes.  I tasted them: they were red skin potatoes with some of the skin in there and plenty of flavoring and very good.

While we had a generous meal, we felt for the benefit of our readers to press on and have dessert.  While \"Death by Chocolate\" cake sounded tempting, they were out of it, so we got Peach Cobbler instead. It came in a bowl: sliced peaches topped with a light pastry that was seasoned with the warming spices of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves (it seemed) and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Along with that we received the complimentary mini-doughnuts dusted with sugar and cinnamon.  Those melted in your mouth.  Tiffany gave us both two, but they never made it home!   Oh, and the Peach Cobbler was delicious, too!

Verdict: this is a great place for families and couples and anyone else as it is very welcoming and has great food to suit most tastes.  Except probably not if you're vegan.  I left it with a nice warm feeling all over and the thought that I would return.

Yelpers: there is currently a discount of 10% off the bill if you mention it."}
{"text":"Amazing. Best food in Phoenix by far. We came for lunch with no expectations and were blown away. We ordered the brisket appetizer, two choices of ribs, the brisket entree, and Mac and cheese. Everything was incredible we left completely full but still wishing we could've eaten more. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying, this is the BEST BBQ place I've ever had. The ratings and the reviews are all true. The best! My friend and I were in Phoenix for the weekend, and as soon as we checked in our hotel, we both were hungry and graving some BBQ. I personally was not expecting any good BBQ places nearby, we almost settled with a mediocre place at the Westgate shopping center! Glad my friend stumbled upon Bobby Q's. With over 1000+ reviews and still holding a 4.5 average rating, I came in with high expectations. 

My first thought when arriving was this place was pretty hidden, there is plenty of parking, the restaurant is big, and best yet, it smelled great from outside already! We were a little worried it was going to be busy and would have to wait a bit for lunch because of its popularity, but we got greeted and were seated right away! 

Our server Hunter greeted soon after and introduced himself and told us about Bobby Q and now they smoke their meats. He was extremely helpful and friendly and checks in on us frequently since he knew this was our first time. My friend and I each got the or own 3 meat combo which was only $25 and came with 2 sides! I chose the brisket, baby back ribs, and pulled pork with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. We also ordered their blonde ale beer, which was good refresher. 

We waited for our food, and were given corn bread. Which were amazing!! We had to stop ourselves before we got full from them. Our food came quicker than expected, and we were not disappointed. There was definitely more food than I was expecting. There was going to be leftovers for sure. Having the first bit was heaven and knew immediately this must've been the best BBQ I've ever had. Way better than the Wood Ranch here for sure. My favorite was the spicy BBQ that our server Hunter gave us. It had a little kick without it being to spicy. My friend and I enjoyed our plans until we were too full, which we barely ate half our plates. We were more than happy to have it for leftover dinner. 

Before leaving, Hunter gave us complimentary donuts, which were a great touch, but we were way to full to have any, so added it on to our leftover bag. 

Overall, this place was delicious! Service and food was excellent!  I will definitely have to stop by here when I come back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Was in Arizona for spring training.   The whole place was filled from fans from different cities.   All the ribs were great the brisket was awesome also.  For side orders we had Mac and cheese and beans were all great.  Service was awesome our waiter was Johnny on the spot with anything we needed.   Hope to come next year."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great food, waitresses are awesome, best place to eat in Arizona..  excellent bbq.. if you live in Arizona or anywhere for that fact and haven't eaten here.. your missing out. The staff is the best and prices are good for what you get. I love this place and will continue to come here forever..."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Ate at Booby Q Friday night.  It was busy but we were seated promptly.  Service was excellent and the food arrived quickly.  The steak was excellent.  This place has great management and staff.  It is no wonder it is consistently busy.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We made reservations for here (on Yelp) 15 minutes prior to arriving, and they got our party of eight in right away, even though there was an hour wait. The service was amazing and the food was 5 stars. The meal started with super moist and tasty cornbread and a delicious onion wedge that our whole table enjoyed. Everyone's food was so good. I ordered the baby back ribs and they fell off the bone and melted in my mouth. The meal ended with full stomachs and complimentary fresh, warm donuts.  I was very impressed with my whole dining experience and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The Food was BOMB MY N*GGA ! The service was great, friendly and nice environment. Recommend it to everyone who loves some good bqq ribs."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant the service is amazing and the food matched it !! Had no issues loved how the manger on duty walked around to see how every table was doing ..can't remember servers name but he was amazing ! Restaurant is kinda pricey but worth it !"}
{"text":"Great home style cooked food and friendly staff. Has a great atmosphere, that is perfect for families or a romantic date. Great restaurant highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing! Ordered the beef ribs and could eat them with a fork they were so tender. After dinner they give you freshly fried donuts that were just awesome."}
{"text":"Food was sub par. We got there about 20 minutes before close and they were converting it into a night club so we got a to-go order. They forgot some of my order and it defeated the whole purpose of going there. The donuts were good, but I know good BBQ and this isn't it. I called and left a message about the messed up order and they took like a week to call me back. Not going back."}
{"text":"The people at Bobby Q's are so friendly. This is the best BBQ in the area. I got the brisket for take out. The prices are reasonable and the quality is amazing. I give 5 stars for the brisket!!!"}
{"text":"I give it 1 star for its BBQ. My wife and just happen to see a sign saying Bobby Q has the best BBQ in the country. Here is another example of over priced and over rated BBQ!! Not only are they NOT the best BBQ in the country! They are not even the best in Phoenix! I am not sure who they paid for that rating, but they got ripped off. If you are going to say you are the best in the country. you better be the best! And Bobby Q doesn't even come close I am sorry to say. But I will say the rest of the menu is good and the service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Awesome bbq and great service.   I went with a friend from work during lunch.  While it is a little hard to find (nothing a gps won't fix) the food is amazing!  I had the sampler.   Left very very happy. A must try for bbq fans out in AZ!"}
{"text":"Great food #1 I've went twice in one week ! I really enjoyed the brisket sandwich and the ribs are very good.. the portions are good size so at least you leave don't leave hungry.. I will be back again. The atmosphere was awesome inside and they have a great patio, nice and shaded , way better than I thought considering the neighbor hood and the parking is interesting. The prices are a bit much considering I eat a lot of BBQ all over the valley. But it's a sweet spot and probably one of the nicest places around right off the 17, so it's very convenient."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly and delicious food. The ambiance is chill. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Im seriously in a food coma right now.  This is the 1st time here.  Our waitress Alexamdra told us all about the history.  The food was excellent.  We will definately be coming back.  I give this place 20***"}
{"text":"Best of the valley award winning and deservingly so. Nice attmosphere, great service, and most importantly AMAZING food.  Portions are large enough to share.  Craving great bbq, give this spot a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The brews are great but the BBQ is not the best. They gave us a waiter in training today and he was walking around with the supervisor most of the day. Im sure this is not the best process but what ever works for them might not work for the customers. 

We tried the smoked wings for starters and the shrimp appetizer both great plates. 

For lunch we ordered some of the links, st louis ribs, baby back ribs, and the smoked pulled pork. None were more than ok. 

I would give the place try might not meet up to my expectations but it might to yours."}
{"text":"Bobby Q's catered our wedding and the food was absolutely awesome. I've also had their food at other catered events and it was equally awesome then, too. I've impressed that a BBQ-based company is so accommodating of vegetarian diets and that their vegetarian food is actually really good!

We had a Mexican meal catered for our wedding. Our guests raved about the meats and I really enjoyed the enchiladas and guacamole. The servers were good, the food was excellent, they went the extra effort to match their buffet display to our wedding colors, and the cost was far more reasonable than most wedding meals. If it hadn't been my wedding, I would have stuffed myself silly on the food it was so good.

I've also had the barbeque meal catering at a different event, and it was delicious! The servers were so accommodating as soon as they heard I was vegetarian (offering to grill up some other fare for me). The mac & cheese and biscuits were awesome."}
{"text":"The ambiance.....i cant say enough about the fantastic feel this place has. It has a rustic look with upscale charm. I sat on the patio and was nervous the noise of the expressway would annoy me. That exact opposite happened. The fountain with the trickling water and the ebb and flow of cars combined to make me feel peaceful and relaxed. The place is incredibly clean as well. 

For the meal itself I ordered Q-rolls to start. These were like beef brisket meeting an egg roll.  It was served with a chipotle sauce and bbq sauce. It was easy to eat and very tasty. The crispy dough outer shell complimented the flavor in the beef. 

For dinner i ordered the 2 choice option. Beef brisket, of course, and the baby back ribs because sever said they'd be one of the best i would ever had.   To be honest, i have had better beef brisket in Tennessee. By all means it was excellent but a tad dry compared to some of the juicy fatty brisket from those hillybilly towns off the  main roads. The server did not lie about the baby back ribs. My grandmother's ribs compete with these and that says a lot to the quality and taste. WOW!!!!!!  Wonderful!!!!!  I also ordered the ranch baked beans. Very flavorful. It has beef and pork in them. Some of the meat was stringy so texture was odd but flavor is great. 

As for the service.....OUTSTANDING!!!!!  Hunter was my server and his knowledge of the menu and ability to give tips enhanced my experience. He was friendly and had just the right amount of chattiness. The manager, Cameron, was also extremely attentive. I felt like i was in the fine dining section of a cruise ship. They both teamed up to make sure everything was perfect throughout the night. 

I look forward to returning here to try more of their fabulous menu items!!!!

Ps. They due brew their own beer. Tastes like a shiner bock with less after taste."}
{"text":"I grew up with Dinosaur BBQ in syracuse before it was famous and the flavor changed.... This place topped dinoq it was amazing"}
{"text":"We had beef brisket.  It was overcooked and dry .The sauce had an unusual flavor may be too much vinegar . The beans were cold . Corn bread was also dry and was overcooked . Sr ice was good but I will not go back in the near future"}
{"text":"Not real BBQ...just over cooked meat."}
{"text":"The best brisket sandwich I have ever had. Moist. Just the right amount of sauce. 

I was just passing by and just decided to try it based on yelp reviews. They were all right. Delicious food. 

The service was great. The sandwich was delicious. I also had the Mac and cheese. Tasted very bad for me but fantastic. 

I wanted to try it again to make sure it wasn't just a fluke. I had another brisket sandwich. Delicious again. The waitress was very friendly and very helpful. The manager stopped by and asked how everything was. I will definitely be back even though it's about a 40 minute drive from home."}
{"text":"Came back again and this time brought some friends to help us eat the Hog Heaven meal and we still had a ton of yummy left overs. Our waitress (I think her name was Megan, sorry I can't remember now) was super patient with us. She was always on top of things. Jason, the manager, came by and said hi to all the patrons. What a nice guy!  Look forward to coming back here again and again. Sign up for their newsletter!  I just got an offer for a free appetizer."}
{"text":"We hit this spot on our way out of Phoenix yesterday.  We had received awesome feedback from our friends.  I am always a little biased when it come to BBQ because I lived in St. Louis, KC and Memphis. 

Let me tell you that this place is outstanding!!  The ribs, beef brisket and Cajun shrimp appetizer were excellent.  

Better than the food was the wonderful service.  Even the manager stopped by to check on our experience. 

We will stop here on every future trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is THE best southern restaurant! No doubt about it. My fav restaurant in the world. I come here often. The food doesn't compare ANYWHERE else. I love the mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, ribs everything. Great customer service everyone makes you feel welcome. I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place. Top rating.  Cool restaurant, great vibes, friendly people, outstanding food and nice bar area. This is a can't miss.  Cornbread and awesome BBQ, brisket/ribs and mac n cheese that will blow you away.  Oh yeah, the \"thank you donuts\" - incredible.  Might as well order a dozen of those babys take my word for it! I found my sizzle here. Ask for Tiffany, she is awesome!!  See ya there.

UPDATE: I ordered the hamburger there and FORGET ABOUT IT - THIS IS THE BEST BURGER IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA.  The staff here, in my opinion (aside from Hillstone which is equally as good) is the best you can find anywhere.

Other restaurants should figure out how they hire people and pay them to figure it out.  I have been to hundreds and hundreds of restaurants across the United States, you won't find better."}
{"text":"Told 2 Phoenix natives last month that I'd be in Phoenix  & was going to be with my 88yr old mom & that she loves BBQ & asked for BBQ suggestions. Both said hands down Bobby Q. They were 200% in the money! Service was incredibly friendly, prices more then reasonable & the food...YOWZA!! No words for how good. The meat is bursting with flavor & couldn't be more tender. One in our party doesn't eat meat & he devoured the poor boy catfish sandwich & said it was the best he'd ever tasted.  Mac n cheese & Cole slaw sides also tasty. Ooh and loved the corn bread & of course the donuts! There is nothing not to love at Bobbi Q! I have 2 upcoming trips to Phoenix & this will be a stop both times! Yummy"}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING OMG!!!! And the service was just as good. Our server helped us out so much since our group of 4 had never been there. But the bar was pretty disgusting. To start it off one of the bartenders jumped up on the cooler where they keep clean glasses and is also at the bar top height where people's food and drinks were. Then the same bartender took a container that was used to keep mixing tools and mixed up a drink in it then put it back on the counter and put the mixing tools back in it with out washing it or getting a new container. And then watching how the drinks were mad was pretty bad the bartender consistently under poured all the drinks. Overall it was a great experience except for the bar. And make sure you get there early enough or make a reservation it's a popular joint so expect to wait. I will absolutely be back when I come in to town again."}
{"text":"Overall really good restaurant. A little hard to see off the road. Had a big party and they were pretty on top of things. Nice wait staff and clean restaurant. The food seemed like it sat for a while before it hit our table. I'm sure it would have been a lot better but it tasted like we were eating take out. I was really looking forward to this place bc of all the great reviews, and BBQ is the birthday boys favorite. Unfortunately multiple people in our group said the same thing about the food."}
{"text":"We arrived at around 8 on Saturday and waited around 20 minutes to be seated. It was pretty busy.

The wait allowed us to check out the menu before hand and we knew what we wanted before we sat down. Unfortunately they were out of baby back ribs so I had to opt for the St. Louis style. FALLING OFF THE BONE. They smoke that shiz for 18 long beautiful hours! We were all very happy with our meal and I only wish there was BBQ this good in LA.

Afterwards we all shared an order of peach cobbler and nearly fell asleep at the table from tasty overload. I haven't had cobbler that good since I was a kid and my godmother use to pick the fruit fresh from her trees.

I bookmarked this spot for our trip to AZ and completely forgot to mention Yelp for 10% off. I would be kicking myself harder if the food wasn't worth the price in full. I have to remove the one star for not having the baby back ribs."}
{"text":"Had the brisket and rib combo.  Brisket was tender and juicy, great flavor.  Ribs were awesome, pulled the bone out with no resistance.  Mac n cheese was good and gooey, as it should be.  Wife had the pulled pork sandwich, no complaints there either.  All around good experience for some good BBQ, definite return trip warranted when we're in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Another great dining experience.  Hunter & Taylor took good care of our table.  Good app recommendation, we went with the Q rolls, I could have eaten them all for my meal, but shared.

We all had different entrees/ sides; we all enjoyed our choices. I recommend any of their entrées, but you must try the pecan Cole slaw.  It is soooo good,creamy sweet with crisp fresh slaw with fresh pecans.  Give it a try.   The cornbread is awesome and they will give you some homemade sugar doughnuts on your way out.  

Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Very good food! Great service! They have the BEST ribeye steak in town. They have Fleming's Steak House beat hands down. Much better steak & price. There appetizers and side are very good. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Seems good so far.  We had a good time, the food was fresh.  Mary, my wife, had something she did not like and the corrected it too.  I had a side that was not warm enough (baked potato) and they swapped it out for another side dish."}
{"text":"I don't think I can say enough positive things about our experience. We stopped by Sunday afternoon on our way home back to LA from Payson, AZ. The reviews is what drew us in and off course. Called ahead of time to put our name down. We were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance. The manager, Laura greeted us and ended up seating us. We told her we found the place on Yelp and were from out of town. Our waitress came right away. Super attentive. Laura came back to check on us. Asked us what we ended up ordering (Ribs & Catfish) she insisted we tried the brisket, brought us a little sample.....SHOULDVE ORDERED THE BRISKET!!!!! Oh My Gawd! AMAZING. Even contemplated taking some to go, but we were staring down the barrel of a 7.5 car ride. My sister lives in Goodyear, AZ I already informed her to make the drive!!! Next time we are in town you know where to find us! Oh wait...don't forget the hot fresh mini donuts you get in your \"Thank Q\" bag with your check! They're literally doing everything right. Please come open one in Simi Valley, CA!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great catering - easy to work with - Don't skip the Mac & Cheese!"}
{"text":"I'm from California & I have to say this joint has the BEST BBQ ever; Excellent Service to the food! Thank you Leanne-I'll be back soon and I hope to have you as our server!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome and the brisket is the best I've had since living in Texas. Their corn bread is sweet and soft and the cowboy beans are the best. Not much else to say. Wish there were more locations!"}
{"text":"It took a UYE (thanks, Deb!) to get me to finally try this place which is just a few blocks from where I live, and now I'm sorry I didn't try it much earlier. The cornbread starter was awesome - I could have eaten all that was in the basket, but had to be considerate ;-) Upon a yelper's recommendation (thanks, Jacob!), I had the St. Louis style BBQ ribs with sides of roasted corn and pecan coleslaw.  The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, so amazingly good. The more sedate flavors of the sides were a good counterpoint for the intensely savory ribs. We shared desserts -- the chocolate overload was good, and the peach cobbler was not overly sugared like it usually is in most establishments. I like it better that way because the taste of the fruit comes out more, although apparently the others preferred sweeter.  My only gripe was the lighting: on our table, the spotlight-like fixture above me shone harshly on me while keeping the others in comfortable darkness. The servers were friendly and efficient, and the mini donuts given on the way out were scrumptious. This is one place for many return visits, and I'll make sure they seat me in an area without a mini-searchlight above."}
{"text":"Great place. Good food and nice staff. Free doughnuts on the way out. Never had any problems"}
{"text":"Wow. All I have to say is the food (especially the Mac n Chz) is so good! Even for left overs. Very good service! And after dinner we even went over to the Club Side - Q Lounge. Nice people and good security. Bathrooms very clean as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after a spring training game and wow! The food is amazing the service top notch will stop by again when in town....oh and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"I came here tonight with my family for dinner.

My wife and I have been here several times. We love the food and the atmosphere. The service has always been great too. 

I wish things could have gone differently tonight, but the way everything was handled was truly professional.

We ordered our food and the bus person was clearing out our table. Well, he accidentally dropped the plates and sauce basically exploded everywhere under the table. My legs were drenched in sauce and my sister's new pair of shoes were stained. My sister had to run to the bathroom to see if they were ruined.

The bus person was very apologetic and so was our server about the incident.

The restaurant manager came up to us after my sister returned and she was also very apologetic. She offered to replace the shoes, she comped my sister's dinner and even threw in free desert. She even got my sister's food replaced because she was waiting in the restroom trying to clean up while her food was getting cold. 

Food was great, the manager really knew how to take care of the customers. I know we'll absolutely be back! 

Try the Q-rolls!"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese to die for. Ribs fell off the bone. Donuts at end were a treat. Was on vacation and ate there twice it was sooo good."}
{"text":"Huge...Huge...HUGE!! Ordered the two way combo. Ribs and Brisket with beans and mashed potatoes. Everything was tasty and the service is really good. Cornbread is ridiculous! We were here for a baseball tournament and the staff took care of the whole team in a professional manner. Definitely a go to place the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I'd probably say this is the best BBQ in town! Or at least phoenix, north phoenix! Really really good, take the whole family no one will be disappointed"}
{"text":"I have heard many things about BBQ in the state of Arizona. Everything from how its not in the same league as KC and TX Bbq and how it lacks flavor like bbq from those places. but I have to say that this place makes me wonder if they never ate here.

It is certainly not blue collar BBQ as its not cheap which means its food not everyone can enjoy. That is the magic of BBQ! I lacks that  \"wear the shirt you dont mind getting messy\" feel which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. 

Otherwise the meat is expertly smoked (you can smell it on the drive in which is key), the flavors are amazing, ribs fall right off the bone and of you so much as breathe on the meat it falls appart for you. 

The endless cornbread is really a nice selling point for me now as its so moist and yummy. 

The waitress was very well versed on the menu and provided some excellent attention to us while we were dining. 

The food was fantastic, the staff is very friendly, the setting is well enough for a special occasion. Its not your everyday neighborhood bbq joint but if you just got paid and want to celebrate a special occasion then this place will send you home with a full belly and a smile of your face."}
{"text":"One of very favorite places to have a nice dinner. My wife and I met at Bobby Q's 11 years ago, so it is an extra special place for us. :) Best BBQ pulled pork and brisket in the valley and be sure to try the Q Rolls for an appetizer. YUM! :)"}
{"text":"My Guilty Pleasure: 

Hands down one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix and the top 5 best BBQ I've ever had. I have nothing negative to say about this place except you might feel a bit guilty after all the food you will have! The portions are pretty big without the big price tag. A dinner for 3 will cost you less than $50. Great atmosphere and usually good service also. Be prepared to wait about 15 minutes on weekends and the dinner rush if you do not have a reservation, but it is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome...service is awesome! Came in on a Sunday evening with a party of 13.  Justin and Amberly did an awesome job serving us.  
Baby back ribs come right off the bone.  The corn bread is amazing and the donuts that they have are to die for!  Price is good too.  For 13 of us the check came out to 211..not bad at all!!!!"}
{"text":"My reason for the low rating is due to misinformation about their happy hour buffet regulations. I did some researching before heading last night and nowhere did I read about an age restriction in order to partake in the section where they hold the buffet. So when my husband and I and our friends, who had a baby with them tried going in we were shocked to learn we wouldn't be allowed to go in because we had a baby with us. Yet none of this information was posted any where so we were all surprised. Also the fact that there was no manager present did not help our situation, what place doesn't have a manager present at all times? What made things worst was how the host who went by choo choo came off to us as rude when dealing with our situation. We had a big group of friends waiting for us at the patio, where we could of easily been seated but had to turn away and leave our friends because they refused to let us go in. Disappointing costumer service to say the least."}
{"text":"WOW!  What a pleasant surprise!  We were in town from Iowa and saw the wonderful reviews.  So seemed liked a great place.  And we were actually in awe of how good Bobby Q's was!  Absolutely the BEST baby back ribs we've ever had and the Smoked Chicken was wonderful too.  Actually EVERY single thing was awesome.  PLUS - we had FANTASTIC service!  Just couldn't have been a better experience.  And then donuts on our way out.  WOW - wish it was a little closer to Iowa! :)  Thanks Bobby Q's for welcoming us to your wonderful BBQ.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Phoenix! I love the rotisserie chicken and mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"I'll go 4.5/5 for this one.  I've eaten BBQ all over the country, and I can't say Bobby Q is \"as good as it gets\", but they are pretty darn good.  Almost 3 weeks ago Mr. M and I met up with Tim S. and his family to give this place a try.  

Right away I was impressed with the friendly service, and the hostess was helpful when we needed to add a high chair to the table.  Our server was Kanisha and she did a great job and was on point with taking our orders, making sure our drinks weren't empty, and bringing us togo boxes and the check when we were ready.  

We wanted to be able to try a wide variety of items so we started with the Q-rolls ($10.50), which are absolutely delicious.  Brisket wrapped up like an egg roll?  Heck yeah!  Those disappeared quickly.  We also started with their house beer, which if memory serves is an amber ale and that was a nice, easy to drink beer.  Really enjoyed that as well.  The smaller one is $4.95 and the larger one is $6.00, so the moral of that story is, go for the big one!

I ordered the BBQ chicken/prime rib combo ($34) which came with 3 sides.  I chose the loaded baked potato, mac & cheese, and the ranch beans.  Mr. M ordered the 3 meat combo ($25) with pulled pork, brisket, and some ribs.  

I thought I would waddle out of the joint stuffed to the gills, but we actually had so much fun talking that I didn't eat nearly as much as I thought I would.  Here's what I thought of the food:  Prime rib, chicken, and ribs:  Excellent!  Brisket: very good.  Pulled pork and ranch beans: really nothing going on there.  Very little flavor in the pork, and the beans tasted syrupy and had no BBQ flavor.  The other sides we had were very good.  I could OD on the mac & cheese.  Nicely done.

Lunch was pricey if you look at the receipt total of $93.63 after tax, before tip, but we had a lot of leftovers.  Overall we had a great experience and I would go back any time."}
{"text":"first review ever..

best mac and cheese in my life thus far..

the smoke aroma from the ribs and sausage tends to break dance on your taste buds well after swallowing..

the meat falls right off of the bones..i know the term flaccid is not a great word to use for meat or marketing meat but the way everything retains its flavor while being cooked to perfection,  while maintaining abundant flavor is, while applying the laws of inertia through the recesses of your fork is incomprehensible..

I'll be back in 48 hours bc coming back tmrw just looks desperate.."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ. Rough part of Phx and it is kind of tough to find the place, let alone the door once you park there. The food was well worth it, however and the manager even gave us some free mac n cheese to try. It was awesome. We got free cornbread, the mac n cheese bowl, and doughnuts when we left. Service and food was really good. It's a 4.5/5."}
{"text":"Looking for some good BBQ?  You won't be disappointed with Bobby Q's.

As soon as we were seated, our server came over with a friendly greeting and a basket of warm cornbread.  She recommended the Q Rolls which are flour tortillas stuffed with smoked brisket and deep fried.  5 rolls per order - served with chipotle ranch dressing and bbq sauce.  The perfect combination, moist brisket inside a crispy tortilla shell.

Hubby prefers the St. Louis ribs and I had the baby back ribs.  The ribs had a nice smokey flavor and the meat practically fell off the bone.  Each bite was a a mouthful of heaven.

We chose the mac and cheese and the pecan salad as our sides,  The mac and cheese was nice and creamy.  The pecan cole slaw was okay.  Basically coleslaw sprinkled with chopped pecans.

Service was great!  Our server was very attentive.

Although we didn't have room for dessert, our server brought us a little bag of donuts to take with us.

YUM...what more is there to say?!?  Too busy licking the sauce off the fingers."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Bobby Q! I've been to Phoenix twice to visit my brother and both times, we've paid a visit here! Their outdoor seating is so cute, especially in the evening when they turn on the light fixtures. What I love is that you can come here for a casual lunch with a friend, come in for a meal with a group/family or for a casual dinner date with your beau. Most dress casual, others put on a cute dress if they're in the mood. Do you! 

They're also extremely accommodating. On my second visit, we squeezed in a quick dinner before my flight. We were really TIGHT on time on a Friday night and when we arrived, we needed a table for six [ugh, we're jerks for showing up expecting a table, I know]. Anyways, there was a long list but my brother finagled a little bit and we managed to get seated in within 15 minutes. 

There are several items on the menu that I think are worth your money:
- Spinach Artichoke Queso Dip: YUM!!! My brother and I are crazy about this dip. It comes with some damn good garlic toast. Definitely one of my favorite appetizers ever. 
- Baby Back Ribs: Can't go wrong with their Baby Backs! They fall right off the bone. *DROOLS*
- Two Meat or Three Meat Combos: This allows you to pick from a variety of options including beef ribs, baby backs, St. Louis, Brisket, Pork, and more! 

Can't forget to mention that all of their BBQ platters come with your choice of two sides, sauces and cornbread! 

Can't wait to be back in Phoenix so I can have another meal here!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is reasonably priced and the portions are large enough for lunch the next day. Wish their beer menu was a little better and cocktails not so expensive but everything is made from fresh ingredients so I understand. I LOVE THE FOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"I have seen the sign while driving and FINALLY decided to try it, glad we did.  Austin was our server and he was great super friendly and attentive.  
I had the beef brisket with mac and cheese and pecan slaw..brisket was super moist and thank goodness it was not covered in sauce just a little drizzle (would have been perfect w/out sauce too), mac and cheese was WONDERFUL!  pecan slaw was just OK.  My son had the chimi shrimp with mac & cheese and mashed potatoes of course we had to share a few bites, shrimp was done perfect had great flavor the potatoes did not disappoint either they were yummy to.  
Had to have a little desert of course..peach cobbler was simply amazing!  

For sure going to be back VERY VERY soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and the sugared donuts are to die for. Wish they had more locations, but a great evening out."}
{"text":"We were really enjoying the outdoor eating area.....until some yokels at the next table started talking to and feeding the sparrows.  In about 2 minutes we were covered up in birds landing on the ground, on the chairs at our table and even on the table itself.  We got up and entered the building.

So....the food.  We ordered and split the sampler platter, with barbecued chicken, brisket and short-ribs.  All three were top notch.  Fairly good selection of beers, I enjoyed an IPA from Deschutes Brewery, something we don't see much of on the east coast.

Except for the outdoor experience, this is definitely somewhere to check out if you like BBQ."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, and very friendly service. It's not quite a \"5\", as it doesn't stand out with the superlative factor leaving a ever lasting impression. Nevertheless, it's worth a stop it your nearby and looking for some good BBQ."}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I've passed this place on the fwy. But finally I tried it and was amazed at how juicy, tender and satisfying the meat really was. Tried the feast platter with my date and we couldn't believe how yummy it was. We couldn't even eat half of it. It was so good and worth every penny (although is only served Sundays). Had ribs, chicken, tri-tip, slow cook pork and....something else PLUS two sides and corn bread. It was so good we said we must go back. A must try.

Odd location. Lower income neighborhood. But the restaurant is fun, clean & well presented. On weekends: they have dj/live music and dancing. Fun!"}
{"text":"One of the best ribs and brisket I had. The rib meat could have fallen right off but it was just right- juicy and flavorful . The brisket was flavorful but could have been less dry. Overall top 3 ( I've been to a couple in Austin and Houston) and this one made it on that list. The meal comes w one side ( Mac and cheese- a little too cheesy for me tbh) and corn bread (could be warm. Order the sweet tea and call it a day!"}
{"text":"This amazing place has been here what 30 35 years, maybe even longer. They are still great, if not better than ever.
I have always liked the food here. I just never seem to make it out to this part of town anymore.  If you are at Metro center or on the I17 headed south this is a great place to stop for Lunch or Dinner.
The meat here is wonderful! I mean really good. I love the Ribs, and the BBQ sauce is mighty fine. 
It is always busy here, is it any wonder. they are still serving up great food and great service. I know that they have a lot of other things on the menu, but I always  get BBQ.
When you like it, don't change. Full service bar and lots of parking.
Please do not drink and drive though.
Years ago the staff used to dress up in Costume, too bad they do not do that anymore."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Service was great just thought it was odd that the big dinner meant to be shared with 5 only came with small sides that on"}
{"text":"After the review (below) of my catered dinner from Bobby Q, I received this email:

I would like to apologize for your catering experience. We pride ourselves on our food and take negative reviews very serious. I've shared your review with the owner and the kitchen manager. I would like to invite you and your family in for dinner on us. We would like to prove to you the quality of our food. Just call me directly and make a reservation. Again, we apologize for your experience. 
Jason Gilliland
Restaurant Manager

I wasn't sure how I felt about accepting a free meal - that was really not a goal when I wrote the first review.  In fact, my first thought was why should I waste my time on doing this food again?  But - I was very impressed with Jason's email and decided to give it a shot. He wasn't asking me to change my review - he was aksing for a chance to prove how good they can be.  If it was terrible, he was running the risk of me updating with an even worse review.

My roommates and I all had the day off today, and around lunch time we were discussing food.  We were definitely in the mood for BBQ.  I called Jason, and he immediately set up our reservations for dinner tonight.

Complete breakdown on the experience - 
The room was nice!  Actually, the place was MUCH nicer than I expected a BBQ place to be - but not so stuffy we felt underdressed.
Our server was Ashleigh - she was 100% on point tonight!  From her brief rundown on what Bobby Q is and what to expect, to menu descriptions, keeping our water and iced tea full, checking back at perfect intervals and - my *wow* moment of service - when she dropped off the moist towelettes, the packages were pre-opened!  Sounds silly - but when you have BBQ greasy fingers, those packages can be a bitch!
The food - holy mother of wow - this was the same place as the last review?  The food was made with the same recipes in the same kitchen??  The only thing that tipped me off was the cornbread - still over the top amazing!
The three of us split the Cajun shrimp appetizer with garlic toast points.  While it did not have the level of kick I've come to expect from BBQ shrimp, the flavor was incredible.  Adding in the rosemary was a dash of genius, and the 6 shrimp were perfectly cooked.  This is a recipe I'd LOVE to have!
Wedge salad - HUGE!  In addition to the iceberg, tomato, bacon and bleu cheese, there was bacon.  Not just the baon bits - but big chunks of Meat Candy.  The blue was one of the richest and creamiest I've tasted.
For meats, we had brisket, rib eye, St. Louis style ribs and beef ribs.  Across the board, each was fantastic!  Just as the AKC is looking for the \"ideal\" of each dog - the meats we ate tonight could be held as the ideal against which all other meats were judged.  Each of the four was a perfect example of what that meat can become, when prepared perfectly!
The cole slaw does have good flavor - and I adore the fine shred they use.  So now it's two thumbs up for flavor and texture.  The mac and cheese was incredibly rich and creamy.  The baked potatoes - well, they are well prepared baked potatoes.  Either they're done right or wrong - not a lot of middle ground - and these were right.
I aldo enjoyed the featured beer - the Bobby Q Amber - which is brewed by Sonoran - so that was double local goodness.
I'd love to be able to review the peach cobbler - but we had already given up and filled boxes with leftovers to be tomorrow's lunch.  None of us had room for another bite.
Then Ashleigh brought the donuts.  Damn donuts!  Perfect, warm and soft, cinnamon sugar fried rings of perfect!  I knew I was full.  I knew I shouldn't eat anything more.  And I am so lucky she only brought one for each of us...otherwise I'd still be there eating more and more and more of them!
Fantastic dinner - all of us were incredibly happy from beginning to end with the entire experience.
Thank you Jason - if you wouldn't have reached out, I never would have known what I was missing!
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've lived in AZ for 8 months, moved here from the south, and I'm so thankful we finally found some dang good BBQ! Our reservation was at 7, and we didn't get seated until about 7:12, and the staff could not have been more accommodating! They felt so bad, and we were just enjoying the patio- no big deal at all! We even got a free appetizer out of it, so great! Ribs, fried chicken, brisket ALL OF IT WAS DELICIOUS!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation and were seated immediately. We sat for about 15 minutes without the waitstaff acknowledging us. Called a waitress over and explained the situation. She took our order right away. The manager came over and offered no excuses ( which I liked) just apologized. Made remedies to our bill and free desert. Loved the food. I just moved here. Was looking for good BBQ here and found it. Will be back again. Thanks so much."}
{"text":"This place has been reviewed by so many, nothing I could say would be original. Glad we read other reviews.  Loved the mac and cheese and corn. The side potato came with tasty real bacon.   Rib eye was cooked perfectly.  The ribs were excellent.  We consumed enough calories for a week.  The portions are so large, we have leftovers for breakfast.  This was a wonderful Valentine's dinner.  Not good for the health but a yummy once in a while treat.  Oh and the draft beer was extremely favorable!"}
{"text":"Let's just say...WOW! Every aspect of our dining experience at Bobby Q was amazing. The meal starts with endless corn bread, which falls apart in your mouth. The portions are extremely generous, so try not to fill up on appetizers (which are also amazing, by the way). The brisket, pulled chicken, steak fried chicken; and burger were equally delicious!! And the sides are difficult to choose from and will definitely not disappoint!! I'm confident that you can't go wrong with anything on this menu!! Would definitely go back and recommend to all family and friends!! Would go back 10 times out of 10!"}
{"text":"This was amazing BBQ! The brisket had great flavor and was tender and moist. The \"smoasted\" chicken was the same!  And you get fresh donuts at the end."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Visiting Phoenix for the first time and really enjoyed the Smokehouse Burger and Mac and Cheese. Cool ambience, excellent service, and delicious food. Our server Daniel was friendly and prompt and really made our meal an enjoyable experience. Ask for him when you come in!"}
{"text":"Good food, and great service. It wasn't 10 minutes before our order hit the table. The ribs were tender as can be without losing texture."}
{"text":"Baby back and St Louis sale ribs are awesome. Love the coleslaws and baked potatoes.  Will sure be back next time we are in town!!!

Corn bread is also very very good!!!"}
{"text":"Solid BBQ. Service is efficient and the food is delicious. Love the Mac & Cheese. Usually have the pulled pork sandwich but I've also had the beef brisket and its terrific also. Plenty of parking and a good location make this a west side favorite."}

I got the filet mignon it comes with 2 sides I got mash potatoes & garden veggies. It was delicious. 

Also we got the whole hog heaven. Comes with 2 rib choices, 2 meats, & 3 sides. We we got the baby back ribs & St. Louis ribs. They are both good the only difference is the St. Louis ribs taste more smokey. The meats we got both chicken rotisserie. The sides we got were mash potatoes, garden vegetables & fries. There were a lot of fries. The veggies were huge. The meats, were good & ribs. 

After you order your food they bring you corn bread with butter. It's delicious and sweet. Also after your meal they bring you complementary donuts they tasted like cinnamon to me but for my more they tasted like lemons."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best Baby Back Ribs and Mac& Cheese in town.
Our server, Tyler, was excellent with his service.  He knew what to expect from us and when to expect them.  I rate this establishment 5 stars with the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"I'm from California and been to many BBQ places and this place is by far the greatest I've seen to date . I am in no way joking . Just to sign in their was a line . But the 55 min wait was well worth it id wait it 3 times for the meal I've received . The meat on the rip steak chicken etc was just top quality and the way it is cooked in wooden ovens just tops it off . You can taste the quality and it really changes the way you look at food. This place man is one of a kind. After the meal I literally texted my brother and told him Lucile's is trash compared to this place. Don't sleep on this place ."}
{"text":"Bobby Qs isn't the type of place I usually go for.  Its a very touristy kind place, almost like a Macaroni Grill for BBQ.  The big difference though between this place and Macaroni Grill is the fact that the food is actually really good at Bobby Qs.  The staff was very efficient and knowledgeable about the menu.  One of my pet peeves is when a staff member has to go and ask someone about a question I have about the menu.  Its pretty obvious the staff here is trained really well.  I had the ribs which were perfectly cooked.  Again though, not the type of place I go for, its also kind of has a upscale feel almost, but definitely not your hole in the wall BBQ place."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD AND AMAZING SERVICE. I never write yelp reviews for anyone, but this place took the cake. My server was the sweetest gal named Maddie, she was fast and good at her job. The food was falling off the bone good. Nothing bad about this place. Thank you!"}
{"text":"OMG, best bbq in Phoenix, even better than Charleston's! Service was outstanding - Shea, our waitress, top notch, THE best! 
It's an little off the beaten path, but SO worth it! 
The fried cornbread is the best I've ever had, and I'm from the south. The pulled pork wasn't fatty, it was SO moist - had it replacing chicken on my salad and inhaled it 10x over ;-) My husband got the pulled pork sand - was awesome. And, let me say, I haven't had sweeeet tea like this since Texas - to die for!
Would go here again in a heartbeat. For best bbq, it's hands-down the best in the valley."}
{"text":"Definitely the place to be.. Amazing ribs and briskit.. Awesome hosts that know how to take care of the guests.. Extremely impressed with their presentation and culinary skills.. Definite definite recommendation."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times my husband and I have been here. We moved here a little over a year ago and a colleague took him to try it. He came home raving about it until I agreed to try it. It's a fun atmosphere and we went for our first and second anniversaries. Last month we took our newborn son for his first visit :) We love that the manager always walks up to your table to make sure your visit is going well. They also have response cards (usually on the table, but not always) that you can fill out with when you were there and how your server was. That definitely shows that they really care about the service they are providing. Though it's almost always very busy, they have great service and the food comes out quickly and hot. Speaking of the food.. My husband is obsessed with their ribs and spicy BBQ sauce (he always asks for his own BBQ sauce bottle to have at the table) He also loves their burgers and swears that the Mac n cheese is the best in the world. When I go I get the steak sandwich. It's juicy steak cooked to perfection on garlic bread with sautéed mushrooms, au jus sauce, and fried onion strings on the side, incredible. But in saying that.. I always try to go on Saturdays because they have a steak and crab special for $18. Their crab is to die for! They place a candle on your table with a butter tray above it that's perfectly melted and warm. I also love their shoestring fries. They give you complimentary cornbread during your meal and a bag of little donut holes afterward. I love this place. We went here three weekends in a row one time (We had different things to celebrate each time and didn't want to go anywhere else!) I love their specialty drinks too. Like most specialty drinks, they aren't cheap.. But yummy. The shipwreck is my fav. If you like good food and good service, GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Came in last night for my boyfriend's birthday & it was amazing! We were sat right away, the food came out quickly & the staff was very friendly! I used to live in San Diego where our #1 bbq place was Phill's Bbq & this place has beat it BY FAR! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love the baby backs ribs here and the shoestring fries and corn and the onion block.
Service is fast and very friendly. 
All the food is great and everyone is very outgoing.
Anything BBQ is great. The steaks are also really good.
I can't say anything bad.
They go out of there way to make sure you enjoy your time and there great food.
Every meal comes with corn bread it's really good.
You can have a great desert but you also get homemade donuts to top everything off."}
{"text":"Was visiting Pheonix/Glendale for a Raider game, and yelped around for a spot to eat.  This BBQ joint is off the wall.  I have not had BBQ like this and the service is the best.  I highly recommend this place if you are a BBQ aficionado."}
{"text":"If your me and want to find a joint with a rocking atmosphere, awesome food, and just to have a good time, this is your place!This is what we ordered:

Baby Back Ribs W/ Cold Slaw and Potato Salad- 5/5 rating. Ribs were succulent and off the bone tender. They had a smoky and flavorful bbq taste. Both sides were flavorful and were a great palette refresher.

St. Louis Style Ribs W/ Corn and Cold Slaw-
4/5 rating. These ribs were more meatier yet still were fall of the bone tender. However, these had a less of a bbq and smoky flavor than the baby back ribs. Both sides brought value to the Ribs as well. 

Bbq Brisket W/ MAC n Cheese and Cold Slaw- 3.5/5 rating. Brisket was very tender with a nice melt in your mouth texture. However, they lacked a predominant smoky flavor and the portion was skimp to price. Mac n Cheese was very cheesy while Cold Slaw had good flavor. 

Overall, this place is great to pig out and have an awesome time with dynamite bbq. Service was superb and as an added bonus you get mini donuts at the end of your meal;) 
Note: Prepare for long lines or else call in reservations."}
{"text":"I was always hesitant to open my heart to this restaurant because (a) it has about the worst name they could have possibly chosen, and (b) it gets a lot of hype, but now that I work right across the street, I *have* to try it.

My first visit, I went with a tried-and-true classic, and something most people could probably agree is a barbecue bellwether: pork ribs.

Along with the ribs, I had their slightly disappointing lemonade (their beverage selection is quite weak for a barbecue place) and the beans on the side.  The beans were at an acceptable level of quality for a good barbecue place.  The ribs, however, shined.  Melt-in-your-mouth tender, these ribs were smoky and tasty, and the meat just falls off the bone.  You don't even need to pick these up; you can use your fork if you wish.

Of course, I couldn't issue a verdict on a place like this after just one visit.  I went back, and this time for the smokehouse burger cooked medium rare, with shoestring fries.  I don't usually order burgers at barbecue places, but I heard good things about this burger.  And boy, did it live up to expectations.  I am not usually a fan of barbecue sauce on my burgers, but this one really worked.  Part of it was the crispy onion straws, and part of it was the fact that the cook was very close to the mark on the meat temperature.

The meat wasn't particularly lean, so it is a burger you can probably order medium and still have plenty of moisture left.

The fries were also tasty, and were a perfect complement for this burger.

Now, one thing I am not a fan of is the ambiance.  It doesn't seem to have that rustic feel that you usually expect from a barbecue joint; this place seems just a tad too upscale, if that makes sense.  But I cannot deny that they make some great food here.  One could make the case that, despite their horrible moniker, Bobby Q serves up the best barbecue in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This was not on our must try list but I forgot why we ended up here. 

The bestie and I shared one plate of ribs with 2 sides. I must admit, their ribs were delicious and fall off the bones kinda thing but I'm not sure why he LOVES IT SO MUCH. He said it's the best ribs outta all the places that we've been to. Like Phils in San Diego. Or Everest Jones in Oakland. The sauce wasn't bad at all actually. It's not as sour compared to Phils BBQ. If you don't eat much, one full rack is good enough for 2. I thought it would be typical TGIFs or Claim Jumper or BJs ribs but it was much better than that! Well done with smoking the ribs because it wasn't that burnt like most places. I loveee their french fries, the skinny type! Delicioussss. 

Lovely service so that was 2 thumbs up!
It's nice to sit outside the patio but be careful with mosquito bites! 
We came early that day so it wasn't too crowded but it will be after 6P.M.
You get free donuts after you get the bill which is nice!
Lastly, check in for 10% off your bill!"}
{"text":"Good bbq. The coleslaw is delicious. The spicey sausage is not spice at all. But has a good taste"}
{"text":"Food and services service were excellent.  Had the brisket for lunch.  Good portions and the the side are made from scratch.  Def would recommend"}
{"text":"Just thinking about writing this review is making my mouth water... One of my husband and I's favorite date spots. We always prefer to sit at the bar. I love the warm atmosphere. Makes me feel like I'm in a real BBQ joint somewhere in the South. I have never been here when it's not busy. There is typically a wait, but usually not for the bar. (Pro-tip and part of why we are \"Bar People.\")As you walk through the front door, you are not only hit with the delicious smell of BBQ, but something else... Cinnamon? YES! Right behind the Hostess stand, you will notice a few of the girls making fresh, home-made, cinnamon and sugar covered donuts. They place them in cute little paper bags and they come with every meal. Even when you think you are so full, you couldn't stuff anything else in your belly... they hand you these melt in your mouth, warm, fresh out of the fryer, donuts. And you will finish them. Trust me. 

But let's start at the beginning shall we? Guest's get a complimentary basket of their home made Cornbread after they are sat, always nice, but I try to save as much room as possible for the good stuff. I have never gone to Bobby Q's without first ordering the Q-Rolls to start. The BBQ Version of a Taquito. A white tortilla, filled with Smoked Brisket and served with a chipotle dipping sauce. These little babies are the best \"Taquito's\" you will ever have in your life. The chipotle sauce is a bit sweet and compliments not only the chipotle but the Brisket very well. 

As for dinner, my husband and I always share and rarely come home without a to-go box. Our Favorite dinner to order is the Pick 2 Wood Fired Barbeque Platter. The Sliced Beef Brisket and the Smoked Chicken are my favorites. The Brisket is so tender, you can cut it with your fork. (That goes for any of the meats really. No need for a knife here unless you get a steak.) Drizzled with their House, Home-made BBQ Sauce. Perfectly sweet and tangy. The Chicken with its smoky, smothered in BBQ Goodness its juicy and tender. We have had the ribs, the pulled pork, and the sausage. Pretty much anything under the Platters section of the menu... we have had it, and I have yet to leave feeling unsatisfied. As far as sides go... I don't care what you get as long as you also get the Mac & Cheese. This is a MUST!! So creamy and decedent. It's hard to finish sometimes. The best Mac I have ever tasted. 

And there you have it. The best BBQ this side of Phoenix. I dare anyone to say different. Ok... I need to mop up my keyboard now and head to Bobby Q's ASAP. See you there!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing atmosphere for a BBQ place. The meat is fabulous and the BBQ sauce even better. Service was fantastic and the manager was out greeting guests. This place stays true to the over 1000 reviews and four and a half stars. 

We will bring everyone we know here!!"}
{"text":"Service is fantastic, meat falls off the bone, leftovers feed you for another day. Pulled pork, and the ribs are unreal. Mac and cheese is the best side as well. Mini Donuts in a to-go bag cause you won't have space to eat them after your meal. Place can get quite busy, but have only had a good experience so far."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of great BBQ restaurants and unfortunately this was not one of them. Bobby Q was okay, but it was definitely not great. The food was mediocre, and the portions were small for a BBQ joint. In addition the service we received was not good. We had many lags in service throughout our meal, and part of our order was incorrect. I think there are probably better restaurants in the area than Bobby Q."}
{"text":"Great service! Good cornbread, decent coleslaw but it ends there. Our waiter was awesome. He deserves 5 stars. Had a gift card to use & was craving ribs, ordered the big pig platter and the ribs were all that was edible to my liking. Obviously this place isn't hurting because it is packed!!! I will continue to go back to my usual bbq joints."}
{"text":"Sooooooooooo beyond disappointed, this was by far our worst restaurant experience since we've stepped off our plane. The ratings are completely false, has anyone in this area ever tasted gourmet Mac n Chz because that stuff that they serve called Mac n Chz is the worst I've tasted in a long time. The chicken, well can you just say extremely bland & beyond dry. Let's not forget to mention the calamari slash fish sticks, are you serious Mr. Bobby Q because being a Floridian that was definitely not the calamari that we're used to. A Florida restaurant would be closed down if they served crap like that. The only thing we left confused with are the ratings, come in fellow yelpers you're supposed to keep it real & you guys are just disillusioned."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place by accident and after seeing how highly rated it was, we just had to try it.

My husband LOVES BBQ. He's particular about everything from taste to texture to size portions.

He loved it all.

Great atmosphere, great service, food was brought out very quick too!

We had the Whole Hog dish with beef ribs, briquet, and rotisserie chicken. Our sides were coleslaw, baked potato, Mac and cheese, and vegetables. It fed three people and we still brought some home. 

Everything was exceptional! 

My only qualm, and it's a small one, not enough good vegetables. A few squash and mushrooms but mostly onion and bell pepper filler. 

This Cali girl can't wait to come back to visit again!"}
{"text":"I can't complain about anything here.  The food was delicious, portions are generous, the service was fantastic, I loved the atmosphere, you get 10% off by checking-in on Yelp, AND they give you a surprise bag of homemade donuts on your way out!"}
{"text":"This food was the BEST barbecue I've ever had!!!! Worth every cent! Don't miss it. The 30 minute wait was worth it! Service fantastic too! Management checked in with us during our meal!"}
{"text":"Great 5star food, but it's overpriced.  There are other lower priced bbq places in Phx that are just as good"}
{"text":"Bobby Q's was recommended to us by friends who had dined there the previous week. We made reservations and had a wonderful meal. I started off with a coconut lime mojito, which was delicious. The cornbread is incredible! We ordered the whole hog heaven, which includes 4 meats and 3 sides. We selected baby back ribs, St. Louis ribs, brisket and sausage along with potato salad, ranch beans and grilled vegetables. This meal is great for sharing! The brisket was my favorite. The ribs fall off the bone! At the end of the meal, we received complimentary mini sugared home made donuts, which are to die for! Can't wait to try Bobby Q's again!"}
{"text":"Loved it great food, place and atmosphere perfect and non the less staff super friendly!"}
{"text":"*Cue N'Sync - It's Tearin' Up My Heart*

Bobby Q does in fact tear my heart up.  TO A MILLION SHREDS.

Here's the low down...

Good: 
-St.Louis Style Ribs, tender
-Service
-Complimentary Donut Holes

Bad:
-Beef Ribs, tough, small
-Sides: forgettable

Although I love all-things beef, the beef ribs here are a disappointment.  The portions aren't nearly worthy of the price tags and the only reason they serve you the butter-saturated corn-bombs is because you're technically paying for them.  I don't even think the pork ribs are smoked...

The service bumps it up a star, otherwise, a two-star establishment."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I ever had. Huge portions of meat on the beef ribs, what more could you ask for? Ordered a mix plate with pork, chicken, and beef ribs, everything was super tender and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!   And this is coming from people who were raised on Tennessee BBQ.  This is the real deal.  Tender, smoked meats and really good sides.  And the mini-donuts with your check were delish!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I and friends have eaten here many times. Great BBQ. Great steaks   Excellent grilled vegetables. Priced ver reasonably for what you get. Free fresh donuts after your meal. Only downside .......when it gets busy or near full, hostess staff has a difficult time contacting and seating waiting guests. I have been waiting a couple of times and been skipped over. Overall the food is great!!"}
{"text":"First time at Bobby Q tonight. Read about it on MSN as one of the top 10 steakhouses in America. 

We arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday evening at t the place was hopping. We were seated right away tho. Our server, Amber, greeted us quickly. We were brought menus and cornbread as we made our drink orders. 

For entrées we ordered the Ribeye with baked potato and side salad and I got the three meat combo. I ordered Brisket, Baby Back Ribs and a Hot Link. My sides were Mac N Cheese and Pecan Cole Slaw. It all came to $80 plus tip with two glasses of wine.

The entrees were good. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, had minimal gristle and was flavorful. The ribs were very tender. The brisket was good but personally I don't like BBQ sauce on my brisket but that's the way it came. The hot link had no snap but was tasty. 

The Mac n cheese was excellent but the slaw was very boring. Why five stars?  Good food, excellent service and decent value."}
{"text":"Great experience! The food was delicious, the service was super fast, and the staff were extremely friendly. I had the pulled pork sandwich and roasted corn, mmmmm. The complementary cornbread was great too, and they bring you as much as you want, including some to go if you want. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Is a great place to eat. They have different variety of foods that are all very delicious. Coming here quite often throughout the years the level of service is excellent. At night on the other side turns into a club. It's very awesome very much a lot of fun and good music Good Times."}
{"text":"I really liked Bobby Q. Made reservations for a Saturday night.
We shared some Q Rolls and then ordered our own entrees.
I loved the Q rolls. One of three at the table thought them a tad greasy, Two of us did not.
I had the three meat combo with Brisket, St Louis Ribs and Chicken. Mac and Cheese and fries.
Was the meat the best I ever had? No, but it was dang good. My favorite of the three was the Brisket. 
Shoestring fries are my favorite fries and what I opt for them when I can. I demolished the large pile they put on the plate. The Mac and Cheese tastes like it is made with that processed cheese food that starts with a V. I love that processed cheese food that starts with a V. I have had lots of different versions of mac and cheese with my BBQ across the US. They may have used a fancy blend of real cheeses, but in the end, the processed cheese food at Bobby's is right at the top of my fav list.
Adult beverages are a bit pricey, but they are good and not watered down.

The service was great. Joe was our waiter. He was new but I would not have guessed until his supervisor came to the table. 

I will be back."}
{"text":"Short and Sweet. 

Long wait on Sunday Night.  Make a reservation. Location on 27th packed. 

Fast and friendly service. 

Prices too high. $22 for 1/2 rack Back Back and $29 for full rack. $13 for BBQ sandwiches and hamburgers. 

Prime rib and Steaks way over priced for a BBQ restaurant. Drinks (alcohol) overpriced. If you don't mind paying MORE than go for it. Food is generous portions and GOOD but nothing special. 

Mini (free) sugar donuts after dinner are hot and tasty but watch the grease contained herein. All and All if you don't mind paying more and get lots of food and a loud dinning area then go for it."}
{"text":"Bobby Q is incredible! The service was amazing, the meat literally fell off the bone, and almost everything is made in house. Our server was awesome, even though it was busy we were very well taken care of. Truly on of the best in the U.S. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow! The most delicious and tender brisket I've ever eaten. No knife needed as it just melts on your fork. Loved the bbq sauce, not too sweet and he spicy one has just a little heat. The ribs fall off the bone and the portions are plentiful. Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"My new BBQ favorite!! Was so yummy, the wait was insane and we were skipped a few times because she forgot our preference was the patio, but once we sat down it was excellent service and amazing food."}
{"text":"I'm out on a girls vacation in Phoenix and my friend recommended this joint. 

This place has the absolute BEST BBQ I've ever had!!!!  Everything was great from the complimentary corn bread to the complimentary FRESH BAKED donuts they give you as you leave. I ordered the baby back ribs and catfish plate. It came with a baked potato and I requested Mac and chew and grilled corn as my sides. I also had a bottomless frosted lemonade to drink. 

I was so satisfied!!!  Mostly because I have plenty leftovers for dinner."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch with a group of 7. The staff was welcoming and service was great. Everyone was happy with their orders. I had the rotisserie chicken with Mac and cheese and the shoe string potatoes. Yum. Everyone else's entrees looked just as good. The food was fantastic and overall great experience. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I went here with a large group for a friend's birthday. This place is great for large groups! The atmosphere is casual with slightly higher-than-normal ambient noise/sound level. Dishes are large and can be shared. 

Cornbread is served prior to appetizers and entries are brought out. The bread is fresh baked, but in my opinion, slightly dry. It's okay if you're using butter though. I had the Smoked Sliced Beef Brisket with Mac & Cheese and Shoestring Fries for my two side dishes. The brisket was probably one of the best I've ever had. Piping hot, super juicy, and tender (fell apart on my fork as I was picking it up)... With just enough sauce so that the meat wasn't swimming. I liked how they served both mild and hot bbq sauces on the side so you could have more sauce as needed and to the spice level you prefer. The Mac & Cheese was very creamy, but nothing extraordinary. It felt very heavy. The shoestring fries were your typical thinly cut fries that are crunchy, but could use a little more salt. Towards the end of the meal, \"donuts\" are given in brown lunch sacks. They resembled beignets in the shape of donut holes. These donuts were very sweet and oily, but had a nice crunchy outside and soft inside.

Over all, I was most excited about the brisket (next time I come back I'll definitely reorder this dish). The donuts were a nice surprise, but overly oily for my tastes. I would recommend a reservation, since when I went the restaurant seemed quite busy. Not too shabby for a bbq joint in the southwest!"}
{"text":"Sorry Yelpers!  This is not my first time here but the second!  Well if we count the take out my husband brought home Sunday than this is my 3rd.  Everything we have ordered here is fabulous!  On Sunday my husband got the 3 meat meal & I the loaded baked potato with brisket.  The brisket on my potato was Melt in your mouth yummy goodness!  Now I had to fast one of the hubby's St Louis ribs.  Oh my goodness - I was sad we didn't get a rack of those for my dessert.  It was soooo good!!! 

So 3 days later I am here for the ribs & that Mac n cheese. I am trying the Cajun shrimp as a starter which I always get the onion block.  Maybe new favorites to unveil today! Will be continued...."}
{"text":"Soooo good. Brisket, Mac and cheese, q rolls, and the service was wonderful. Manager stopped by the table and asked, how everything was. Little donuts at the end was a great touch. Definitely will venture back again, soon."}
{"text":"We came here for a much needed date night w my boyfriend. He saw this place off the freeway so we decided to have dinner here. When we came in they said it was going to be a 20-30 min wait which was fine w us. We took a seat at the bar to enjoy a few drinks while we waited but we got seated before our drinks even came out. Already a plus. Our server, Cameron, came over introduced himself and gave us a history lesson about the location on how their meals are prepared, which was very good to know. He suggested the Q-rolls for an appetizer and they were amazing. Our meal was outstanding, I had the fried chicken, my boyfriend had the 3 meat combo. Lets just saw we had to take doggie bags home lol. Then I believe the night manager, Lauren, came over introduced herself and thanked us for visiting. I have not been to a location that has such great customer service in such a long time like this. I've been in customer service myself for over 20 years and it's wonderful to see that an establishment like this one truly cares about their guests. Thank you and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is good barbeque in an unlikely spot -- Phoenix.  The meats are all slow-cooked, so everything is fork-fall-apart, Kansas City-style.  They have some variations in sauces, too -- a vinegary Carolina-type sauce, a spicy one and a sweeter KC sauce.

The sides are well-prepared, including traditional cole slaw; corn; beans; potatoes.  For appetizers, try the sauteed shrimp...perfectly cooked and garlicky.  When all is said and done and you hate yourself for eating that much meat, they give you a brown bag of freshly made, sugary mini-donuts.  Just so you can hate yourself a little more.

Service is always friendly and usually prompt.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"If I am just judging based on the food...it gets 5-stars.  I wasn't wild about the chicken marinade or the presentation, but the bbq is good eats.  We felt  rushed because food came so quickly, but I am sure that had to do with how busy they were and the ease of serving bbq.  I would recommend the brisket and pulled pork, as well as the mac'n'cheese.  We had great service as well...wonderful people."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic evening with a ridiculous amount of food at Bobby Q's. Having visited on several occasions, we have never had a bad meal. In addition, the service is always outstanding.  Tyler and his team have always done a great job. In particular, Lexi is one of the best servers ever!"}
{"text":"Best Mac N Cheese in town!! Best steak, best ribs, best onion rings...I don't think I've ever tried something I didn't love! Very friendly staff. \"Take out\" is fast and best of all the pint of mac n cheese is only like $4 including the Best corn bread in town!! Lol"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best bbq joints in Arizona, if not the entire south west! Friendly fast service, always tender and perfectly smoked meats, and fantastic drinks. Fair warning. This place is always busy. Make sure to reserve a table on open table to skip the wait."}
{"text":"The search is officially over. Call off the hounds and rendezvous at Bobby Q. With a name so simple yet perplexing, it must either be the greatest or worst barbecue to have ever existed in this Quadrant. Like a gift from a god, their smoked ribs and brisket are tender to the touch and have the tendency to fall onto the table before reaching your plate. Such tragedy. Minus 1. Their sauce oomph is somewhat mild along with its sweetness and to me that is a blessing. Being a victim of the great-bbq-but-bad-sides or the so-so-bbq-but-good-sides, Bobby Q has made a believer in me that there is a higher power out there that watches over us and to those that do great things, rewards us. Mission accomplished."}
{"text":"Wow! Some great barbecue at this place. It's a bad time to reminisce about the meal I had because I am hungry right now. I only wish the potato salad was more flavorful. Dessert, meal cornbread was all ridiculously delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious! The food was amazing and very full of flavor! Loved the vibe the restaurant gives off. Staff was friendly but we got sat a a big round table set for 6 but our party was only 3 and the table was in the middle of the room so slightly awkward but once we chowed down we forgot all about it. Highly recommend visiting for some brisket!"}
{"text":"Corn bread is the best I have ever had.  The ribs are good, but the brisket was extremely mushy.  Appetizers are great and the ambience is fun."}
{"text":"Terrible service!! This was our third time here and I was shocked at the service. Our waitress was always missing and not coming to our table at all. When she did she never brought us back stuff we asked for. The food did not taste like it usually does. They gave us 3 donuts for a family of 5. Not sure if management changed but I was very disappointed. I will not be coming back!."}
{"text":"Such a great local spot. Our server Austin was super rad. Funny dude and had great recommendations and funny stories. Will definitely be back and recommend this place to friends when I'm back in town. 

The food was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times with my wife. Not sure what is better, the food or the service. They always make you feel at home and bend over backwards to give you great service. Food is hot and fresh. I take out of town guests here and EVERYONE loves it."}
{"text":"Ok I am going to try and get through this fast because I am heading into a food coma and quick. So my friend and I had dinner tonight and we were seated by the lovely manager Rennie who was just so delightfully cheerful. Then we got the best server in the place Jack. I decided to change it up and get something other than the ribs so I chose the two meat combo. OMG the  pork and brisket was to die for and I was not disappointed at all. My food was full of flavor and the meat was tender and juicy you could cut it with a fork. I had chose this plate because my friend ordered the same and she made it sound so good and I was not sorry for not ordering the ribs which are oh so delicious as well. Jack was quick and on top of keeping our drinks filled and making sure we were taken care of so if you decide to dine here ask for him. When we had finished our meal we were pretty full and had opted not to have dessert but Jack was such a sweetie and came out with this heavenly chocolate ice cream cake. I was so full but this cake was just so darn good. I am home now happy and full with my puppy who is licking my bbq scented face lol. I had an extraordinary dining experience and will undoubtedly be back very soon. Sorry no pics were taken because the food was too good I forgot :) next time though."}
{"text":"A little splurgy, but so delicious!!  Ribs fall off the bone and the corn bread is so sweet and yummy!"}
{"text":"We live out of state but definitely wanted to make sure we tried this place out. So glad we did. Cameron gave us great service. The food and drinks were great. Our only thing we would like to have had different is maybe put the bbq sauce on the side instead of on the meat before bringing it out. This way you could enjoy more of the meats smokiness flavor. Otherwise everything was great and the donuts were a great little surprise! We hope to be back again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite barbeque, the service is excellent. Pork ribs, pulled pork,beef ribs, brisket it's all great."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  The atmosphere is cute and the server was so friendly and helpful. Everything we ordered tasted amazing.  I had a ribeye cooked to perfection.  Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes were so delicious.  The potato salad wasn't great but everything else was amazing. Loved the lemonade and my husband had the ribs and Pecan slaw.  It was just really good food and service.  I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Went with husband and famiky for first time today.  WHAT IS ALL THE HYPE? This was the worst!!!  Had the supposed great burger, which I say was mystry meat. From the first bite it tasted weird.  I had maybe three bites and the texture was so disturbing I could not eat any more.  Diarrhea  for the rest of the day, sure I was poisoned.  Husband had sausage; he loves BBQ, but not sure what he was served.  Crossed both our minds we were served food like the did in Chain Saw Massacre. Taste was horrible.  He didn't finish his either and had a stomach pains. Sticking with Dillion's from now on.  This place cannot compare."}
{"text":"The food was awesome, the atmosphere was great, and service was perfect. We really enjoyed the chicken, beef ribs, pork ribs and brisket that we had. The only let down was the corn bread which was kinda dry. The special (forget the name) margarita was ok... not all the waitress chalked it up to be but she didn't look old enough to drink so maybe that was the issue there. Ill get the thing in the pineapple I see pictures of next time. Its a little tough to find, but with GPS it was not too bad. Service was really great, our waitress was on top of it. A manager even came and asked if there was anything he could do for us. We forgot at the end of the meal to show our yelp discount and they reversed our charges and added the discount, no problem. We will definitely make it a regular spot! Only thing I was a little confused about is there seems to maybe be a bar on the back of the restaurant? We looked for it but couldn't seem to find a way in..."}
{"text":"Went  again to Bobby Qs and once again found what I've found before: it's so good it's almost perfect."}
{"text":"I tried Bobby Q's tonight for the first time. Our waiter Jason recommended  some items and everyrhing was delicious. The Brisket was so tender and the ribs fell right off the bone. Great Bbq! I would highly recommend, if you're in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Ordered the Thanksgiving meal for 3-4 people for $75.  Came with grilled corn,  creamy mashed red potatoes, gravy and corn bread.  Wasn't the best meal I had but def would order this again.  Loved smoked turkey for a change than the traditional oven-baked Turkey."}
{"text":"Bobby Q was our first stop after leaving the airport when we arrived in Phoenix and it left one helluva impression! We came by in the early afternoon on a beautiful Saturday and there was zero wait which is perfect because we were starving. We had the choice of sitting outdoors or indoors but chose the latter because not only was it warm out but I saw customers sitting outside swatting flying bugs.

We ordered the whole hog heaven which is a platter where you choose two ribs, two meats, and three sides for $48. With the help of our waitress we decided to go with the baby backs and beef ribs, brisket and sausage for the meats, and the mac & cheese, ranch beans, and the shoestring fries for the sides. While we were waiting, we received complimentary cornbread. Moist, fluffy, buttery, and semi-sweet... these cornbreads were the best I've ever had! I'm sure they are SO bad for your health though but I could only live in the moment!

- Baby back ribs: May sound like a boring choice but nope. These were smoked to perfection and the meat fell off the bone. I was very impressed.
- Beef ribs: If I had to pick a favorite meat of the meal, the beef ribs would be it. These are finger-licking good with loads of meat, and even some bone marrow too. Just divine. Absolutely to die for. LOVE!
- Brisket: The first bite I had of the fatty brisket sent me to meat heaven. Succulent and explosive in taste. The leaner parts of the brisket was a touch dry and needed some extra barbecue sauce to fix that though.
- Sausage: Robust in flavor with a nice peppery kick.
- Mac & cheese: I'm not usually a fan of mac & cheese but these are great. I ate spoonfuls after spoonfuls. 
- Ranch beans: Smoky and savory. Love these beans. Again, best I've had. My favorite of the three sides!
- Shoestring fries: I'm generally prefer thick-cut fries but these were an exception. Impeccably fried and perfectly salted, these were very tasty and fun to pick at. Simple yet awesome.

After our incredibly satisfying feast (yes, we had leftovers for the next day!), we were given freshly fried cinnamon sugar doughnuts on our way out. They were amazing! OMG! The first bite of everything at Bobby Q was seriously like a party in my mouth. Every. Single. Thing. From start to finish.

I LOVE BOBBY BBQ! PLEASE COME TO NEW YORK!"}
{"text":"A bunch of friends and I tried this place for my husband's birthday the other day after I found it here on Yelp.  For the love of everything tasty, this place was the BEST barbeque place I have ever been to (aside from a place I loved that went out of business in San Diego).  After reading all the reviews about the appetizers and entrees, I pretty much already knew what I wanted to order before even sitting down at our table.  

Our waiter, Lorenzo, couldn't have been better with his service and sense of humor.  The feel of the interior was a mix of casual and modern yet not too overly countryfied...there weren't dead animals hanging on the walls staring at me as I ate or hides either.

The group of us ordered the Onion Block for our appetizer.  I am not an onion person, but am a fan of the Bloomin' Onion at Outback.  But I can tell you right here and now that the Onion Block at BobbyQ's was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G-L-Y delicious!  It had the perfect crispy consistency, but what made it was the BBQ ketchup that it comes with.  I could have ate the sauce by itself.  The 6 of us ravaged it.  

For our entree, my husband and I went for one of the winning combinations, particularly the BBQ chicken and prime rib.  We decided on the ranch beans and the Mac & Cheese (after the reviews) for our sides.  I went to ask for an order of corn bread (3 for $1.50) but Lorenzo told me that he would bring us a basket for all of us.  So, I am not sure if that is something that is included, kind of like chips and salsa at Mexican food joints.  

The chicken was absolutely juicy and had the perfect amount of sauce and the prime rib was also juicy and melted in my mouth (we ordered it cooked Medium).  First, the Mac & Cheese was so very creamy and tasty that I had to stop myself from eating that and get back to the meat.  But the ranch beans tasted like so many others I have tasted, not bad though.  My friends and I, who also ordered the M&C, noticed a hint of jalapeno (not spicy, just the taste).  We asked Lorenzo and he told us they have two types of melted cheese in the kitchen, one being the cheese they usually use for the M&C and then this pepper jack/jalapeno cheese they use for other dishes.  He had said they must have accidentally used the wrong one and that it hadn't been the first time it happened.  This was so not a problem, b/c that jalapeno taste was actually what made it, I think.  I'll have to request it next time.  

The desserts didn't impress me much, but I knew from the reviews, we'd be getting free donuts before we left.  I loved that touch!  Mark my words, we will be going back more than once.  I'm sure we will take our in-laws and my family to give them the chance to taste BobbyQ's deliciousness!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Started off with the ohhh sooo good corn bread!  I had the pulled chicken sandwich.  They put home made skinny onion rings on the sandwich!! Slice of heaven on earth!! The home made warm mini sugar donuts...DIVINE!!
Hubby had their brisket platter with potato salad!! It was delish.  We are from Texas so we know good BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Definitely tops in the Valley for barbecue.  The pulled pork platter and the sandwich are scrumptious.  Mild or hot homemade sauces are perfect.  Plus how can one not love the warm cornbread to munch on while your order is being prepared.  To top off, you receive a bag of mini warm sugar donuts when you get your check.  Definitely worth the drive.  Also four function rooms for private and corp events.  Full carry out menu as well.
Enter from southbound I-17 frontage road or 27th Ave."}
{"text":"I'm newish to Phoenix,it's my random visit to this place being the closet place for me I've choose this but thoroughly enjoyed the service and I had south chicken which is amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place we got so muc b food we had a lot of left overs if yur looking for a sit down with a rustic look this is the place."}
{"text":"this place was ON POINT!

server was awesome! we had the brisket, baby back, st louis ribs, sausage, grilled veggies, coleslaw and bread pudding! nothing bad to say about anything. everything had fabulous flavor, grear taste, good smoke, high quality and a LOT of love! when i come back to PHX i want to try the baked potato.  plenty of parking in the back and this place has excellent prices!

keep it up guys!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ!  Due to the distance we do not eat here regularly, but the times we have, we have been pleasantly surprised -- even our picky eater, eats all his food!"}
{"text":"We have saw the good reviews, so we decided to drop in and see it for ourselves. We went to the to go side and ordered to take home. I wish we wouldn't of waited so long. I ordered the pulled pork with shoestring fries and corn on the cob. My wife ordered the half rack ribs and same sides. My pulled pork was delicious and the spicy BBQ sauce is now my favorite sauce I have tried here in Phoenix. The ribs were awesome fall off the bone good. the corn tasted smoked as well best I have ever had, and the cornbread was great. By far the second best meat I have tried and best spicy BBQ sauce here back home love the volcano BBQ sauce at whole hog cafe. Portions were just the right amount to fill you up. Can't wait to try the sausage next time."}
{"text":"This is a neat place to take out of towners.  It's off I-17 but very out of the way and dumpy looking from the outside.  Then, surprise - it IS open!  

We tried the whole hog heaven which was plenty for 4 people.  We got the St Louis ribs and baby back ribs - both delicious and saucy.  We also got the hot links and beef brisket.  I wasn't a fan of the hot links.  The beef brisket was slightly dry but with a bit of sauce it was quite delicious.  

We also got corn and macaroni and cheese as sides.  I wouldn't recommend the corn - its very buttery and overcooked.  Mac and cheese was better, but mostly because its nice against the salty meats.

We also started with the Q-rolls(?) which was beef rolled in pastry material.  The sauce it comes with made it quite tasty as well.

All in all, if you're looking for a nice, sit-down bbq restaurant in Phoenix, this one's hard to beat!"}
{"text":"very good place.  The mac n cheese was actually too rich and creamy for me, but if that's the way you like it, it will be your new fav.  i like mine baked.  chicken and pulled pork sandwiches were great, but i can't scream about the chocolate overdose dessert.  they did send us home with some free freshly made doughnuts, though, so i don't have much right to complain.  we'll be going back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!
The service was a little slow, but it's Father's Day so I anticipated that. Our server was still very attentive and helpful!
The only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is because of the cleanliness level. It was generally clean, but I was turned off by the overhead dust on the decorations and light fixtures. Don't want dust in my food. Otherwise, I highly recommend Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"Barbeque is not my favorite style of cuisine. There. I said it. That having been said, I find myself going to BBQ restaurants on a regular basis because the men in my life live for it. So I got talked in to hitting up Bobby Q. Sure...why not...

The food at Bobby Q is EXCELLENT. Probably the best BBQ I've ever had and as I said, I don't like BBQ very much. Very flavorful, not overly sauced, good sized portions. All around, excellent.

So why the 3 stars? Three reasons.

1) RIDICULOUSLY high prices. It's BBQ, not Morton's steak house. Our party of 4 bill was nearly $100 and there wasn't an alcoholic beverage in sight....

2) Service was not up to par at all. You do not leave the appetizer dishes on the table when you are putting down the dinner dishes. And you don't leave said dishes on the plate after the lady of the table has gone out of the way to stack said dishes perfectly so you can easily take them away. And you don't leave them until said lady has to ask you 3 times to take them away. 

3) Restaurant was dirty. Sorry but leaving tables unbussed all around us just isn't acceptable at the prices you are charging much less at a lower-price-point establishment. 

Bobby Q...get your service up to par, take a good look at your price points, and CLEAN. I'll be back I'm sure since the men in my life love BBQ. I would love to be able to raise your stars!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for the best BBQ in the Nation.  You can really taste the time and effort on preparing the food."}
{"text":"I'm in Phoenix for a pretty lengthy business trip and will make sure to hit this place again before I head home. We started with the Q rolls which are essentially a brisket egg roll. These were incredibly tasty. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the potatoes salad which was great as well.

Apparently I never finished this review since I was in phoenix in january. Last week I returned for work and hit Bobby's again! Wow great food this time I ordered the brisket! Again phenomenal probably the best BBQ I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Rib meat fell off the bone, brisket very delicious, great corn bread and deep-fried donuts. Great service from Austin, too. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We orginally set out in search of another bbq place but it was closed so we ended up at Bobby Q!  Thinking it was going to be a chain-style restaurant.  Boy, were we wrong!  The building and atmosphere was true to the BBQ tradition.  SUNDAYS at Bobby Q!!  $28 got us a family feast of Smoked Chicken, Smoked Brisket, Smoked Ribs(St. Louis style), Smoked Pulled Pork, 2 sides (We chose Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes), Cornbread.  The cornbread was slightly sweet, buttery and very moist!  All the meat was very tender.. but I am partial to brisket which really impressed me the most...  My boyfriend loves ribs and said on the ride home that they are better than his favorite.  The spicy BBQ sauce was a little too tangy for me and needed more kick.  The server Jon was very informative about the menu and knowledgable about BBQ.   We left very full and happy with alot of food to take home!  It was worth the drive across town!"}
{"text":"Wow! We were in this area and decided to yelp for the highest rated restaurant. Bobby Q's was the one. We were so happy with our choice! The food and service were both amazing. Our kids walked away saying it was the best restaurant ever. The baby back ribs and smokehouse burger were the best. We also enjoyed the corn bread muffins at the beginning.  We will definitely be coming back. It's a new favorite for us."}
{"text":"This place is where you come when you want good BBQ. Try the ribs, of course, and they Bobby Q Rolls."}
{"text":"Always good service. Taylor the manager almost always makes it to your table during your visit.  If sometimes something is wrong with your order they ALWAYS make it right. They make it feel like you are important. I have had everything on the menu and like it all. It is a little high on the price side. Try the chocolate desert...Wonderful.. They give you a little bag of cinnamon donuts on your way out.."}
{"text":"other than the lopsided table, food was spot on....very unfortunate that it wasnt an all u can eat brisket night...delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow. Some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Beef and short ribs fell right off the bone.  Awesome coleslaw and the Cajun shrimp.  Yummm.  Great wait staff and friendly   When in Phoenix I'd go here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Don't go when it's busy on a Saturday early evening last Sat: 10-11, went there around 5:30 pm went straight to bar thinking we would be served faster than waiting in line for a table and we like to interact with the bartenders.  WRONG!!!! First off we sat down being the first couple, then another couple, then another couple and then a single person.  All of the other people were served and acknowledged before us!!!  We thought, are we invisible?  We had never been treated like this before!  Tony one of the bartenders NEVER made eye contact with either myself or my husband once!  They were smashed busy full service bar also going to the kitchen to get us cornbread.  But when you first sit at a bar you would think the bartenders know to look up occasionally and greet the customers with at least \"We'll be right with you\"  Tony looked pissed and unhappy the entire time we were there.  The food is fantastic, my husband and I shared the full slab of baby back ribs with two sides: mac n. cheese and coleslaw, excellent with the extra spicy, hot sauce on the side!  Nice hot doughnut holes delivered to us after we were done!  We have eaten here couple times before and got takeout a couple of times when we went camping.  Spoiled our Saturday date night for a couple of retirees.  Hope it wasn't because I was Asian female and he was grey haired older man, kept thinking it was because of my race but not sure, Tony greeted and went right up to take care of a Black couple that sat down next to us.  Who knows, very sad, bothers me until today.  Never treated like the invisible couple before at a bar!"}
{"text":"It was close to the hotel so we dropped in. Great surprise.  We sat at the bar and had great service.  Don't miss the Q rolls, baby back ribs, or the outstanding beer selection. Shout out to San Tan Brewery for the delicious Pale Ale. Please stop in and check out the best \"little\" BBQ joint in Phoenix"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I ate there but went with friends who go there once a week (at least).  The food was wonderful...anything on the menu was a good choice and everything I tasted was delicious!! Great job people."}
{"text":"My review has changed,and by no means is it a reflection of the service provided by the staff were great. I was disappointed in the quality of the ribs I got. Hoping it was an off day. But the disappointment in the quality stuck deep down; I was looking forward to those mouth watering, fall off the bone ribs. Skeptical about coming back just to be disappointed again. May have to go to Mesa location next time. Further but would be worth it if they keep their standards."}
{"text":"\"Very, Very, Very, Very Good!\" my wife's cousin's daughter(what' her official title anyway?) said after her dinner and that sums up this place. 

Great decor. Fast and friendly service. And most importantly good food. Go on Sunday's and they have special called Hog's Heaven at a discounted prices ($28). It comes with 1/2 pound each of the following: Chicken, Brisket, St Louis Ribs, Baby Back Ribs and two sides. More than enough food to feed 4 adults and 4 children. 

The brisket was my favorite. It was melt in your mouth good. I would have preferred if they did not douse it with BBQ sauce as I like it on the side. It was still good. Ribs were off the bone delicious. These were my kids favorite. The chicken was moist. For the two sides we ordered shoe string fries, they were OK, nice and crispy and the grilled veggies. 

When you leave they give you complimentary donuts, which are freshly fried in the front. They have a cool looking mini fryer. They were yummy according to my kids. I did not partake in those as I was stuffed. 

I will be going back to this place again fo-sure. 

BTW there is a bar with a dance floor on the other side of the restaurant for those of you who are interested. Look they were just getting ready for the night crowd when we were leaving."}
{"text":"Bobby Q's has the BEST ribs ever!! I believe they cook them for close to 20 hours so when you get them they are super tender. Once you taste their ribs, you will only come here for ribs. Service is always good! I have nothing but good things to say about this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Our server, Anthony, knew the menu inside and out and offered great suggestions. I don't like barbecue sauce (I know, I know) but the rotisserie chicken was fantastic. I had corn and mac n cheese for sides which were both great. They have a good drink selection and full bar. I had tons of left overs so expect to get a to go box. Unfortunately, I was wayyy to full for dessert but the options looked delicious. They give you a bag of cinnamon donuts when you leave and when they learned we were in a hotel nearby they loaded us up. The service alone deserves 5 stars. I will definitely be back my next time in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food and extraordinary service. What can you possibly ask for more?! We shared a whole rack of St. Louis style ribs. The bbq sauce they brought on the side was sweet and the meat literally just came off ths bones. You don't have to bite it off. And our server knows every detail of food on the menu. She is ready to answer all the questions you have and thorw some recommendations. Had a wonderful time here."}
{"text":"Great place!
We ordered Our Thanksgiving dinner 2 years ago, it was really tasty and the portions were enough.
Planning to order again our Thanksgiving dinner this year."}
{"text":"Food was great! Drinks we're great! Service was great! The overall experience was awesome! After having a horrible experience at Thee Pitts Again we had to find a new BBQ place and we are glad to have found this one! We went on a Saturday night around 6 -7 and we had a 15-20 min wait which was well worth it. One of the managers brought us a sample of the Macaroni and Cheese.... IT WAS AMAZING! Almost needed a glass of milk to wash it down with! We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Feels like a chain. Competent but nothing special.

I had the two-meat plate with beef ribs and brisket; sides were beans and cole slaw. The beans had a nice kick. Meats were competent. The regular sauce was really sweet. The spicy sauce was not too kicky. It was $17.50."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on our way to the Grand Canyon with a group of 7.  YELP didn't fail me again on this one!  Awesome 5 Star service, good quality bbq, very nice both inside and out!  I can see this place being slammed during peak hours, or at least it should be!  Definitely would make a return visit if ever back in AZ."}
{"text":"Best BBQ Brisket EVER!  Just went there for lunch and it was awesome as always.

Fast/friendly service, reasonable prices, excellent brisket and mac n' cheese!

Ohhh...and those lil donut things they give you after your meal. Soooo good!

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The food was delicious and the service was the best! Justin served us, and he was absolutely amazing. He knew it was our first time here, and he did a great job making is fall in love with the place. I rarely get good service when I go out to eat, so I was excited when I got GREAT service here. If the food was mediocre (and it's not) I'd still come back because it was such an enjoyable experience. 

But the food! I had the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and Mac n Cheese. Everything was just great. If you still have room in your belly after the meal, get the donuts!! Get them! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Eat here often. Actually, I tend to order to go more than I do dine in. I have to say, the food is excellent.  Best BBQ in the Phoenix area . Staff is pleasant.  I only gave 4 stars because I feel the staff behind the bar could be more personable."}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. We commute to Phoenix from various spots around the country. But the highlight besides the food is the staff and especially the bartender Chelsea and server Alexis B. Alex's has a an infectious laugh that will get everyone laughing."}
{"text":"I visited this location last night with an ***acquaintance***. My first issue was my server needed to check my ID, fine, not an issue. My issue is he grabbed my ID and moved to the other side of the table holding my ID down and very close to the person across the table in clear view. IDs contain personal info, such as an ADDRESS!!!!!!!! He held my ID so long that this person I was out with could have taken down my address. Need training on proper measurements and safety precautions when checking IDs. 

Moving on, the drinks weren't good to me.. I tried 3 different drinks, The Hammer (or whatever), that drink that comes in a pineapple, and some sangria type drink in a jar with blueberries.. yeah, just no! All three?! Come on.. a better drink menu please. 

Lastly, we move into my meal. It was pretty good. Had the salmon dinner.

Now, the lady Alicia ( not sure if I spelled it right) I'm assuming she's the manager, was great came over twice to ask if the drinks were better and make sure the food was tasting good. Very nice lady"}
{"text":"I'm a Texas native and grew up on barbeque. I knew how to barbeque before I could ride a bike. Okay, that might be a stretch.  I've lived all over the West. As a consultant and general contractor, I've been able to travel around quite a bit in the Central and Western US. Everywhere I went, there was always something wrong about the Q.

I stepped onto the Bobby Q \"campus\" (big property) and was immediately 'greeted' by beautiful shrubs and trees. The exterior is intentional, laid-back, and I love it. It sets you at ease so you can get ready for some great food. It reminds me of the roadside shacks we'd stop at on our family fishing trips in Texas. 

When you walk in the front door you're greeted by people who have \"tenure\". Some of the wait staff have been with the owner over 20 years. Now that's a testament to good business. We (my wife and I) were seated and served their awesome cornbread and butter. Our server took great care with us since we were 'newbies'. 

I had the Brisket, St. Louis Baby Back Ribs and Chicken. HOLY HANNAH - When that brisket hit the tastebuds, I thought I had reached Nirvana then stepped in Valhalla. My eyes rolled into the back of my head and I let out a let out a slight guttural sound of satisfaction. If I wasn't so hungry I would have stopped at that first bite knowing I had reached the apogee of barbeque gastronomy. 

Well, I'll spare you the ennuis of the rest of my experience, but suffice it to say that you too, could reach your barbeque Nirvana by coming here. Have I been back? YES!!! I will keep coming back to get my \"fix\". I hope you enjoy too."}
{"text":"Monday nights are not packed. no reservations required. Seated right away. closes at nine so late dinners might have a time crunch but the waiting staff is super nice."}
{"text":"All you need to know is... PULLED PORK!!! It is seriously one of the best pulled pork I've ever had! I'm from California and we are blessed with Phil's BBQ and my sister and I prefer Bobby Q over Phil's BBQ!

What We Ordered
- Beef Brisket with Mac and Cheese and Mashed Potatoes
- 2 Meat Combo: Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket with Mac and Cheese and Mashed Potatoes
- Steak Sandwich with Shoestring Fries
- Catfish Po Boy Sandwich with Roasted Corn

The complimentary corn bread was good! Very moist! The beef brisket was good! The meat was tender but I felt that I needed to add the bbq sauce for it to taste better. The Mac and Cheese was super duper cheesy!! I loved it!! The Mashed Potatoes were really good as well! Super buttery and smooth.

The Pulled Pork (not pictured because my sister was sitting too far) was AMAZING. It was good by itself or with the bbq sauce! I really wished I ordered this instead, like I originally planned. Luckily, my sister let me sample some of hers. :) My Mom enjoyed her catfish po boy. She's really picky so that's telling you something lol. My Sister and Mom loved the roasted corn! 

The only bad dish was the Steak Sandwich but I don't know if that's because my Dad ordered it medium well. He said it was too chewy and had no flavor. His shoestring fries were really, really salty and soggy! He was very upset, to say the least lol.

They give you little sugar donuts, (Thank Q's), at the end of the meal! They were so cuteeee! They were just average tasting but I enjoyed the fact that they were free! I will come back for the Pulled Pork!"}
{"text":"Holy cow!  My family had some amazing BBQ here.  Best brisket I ever had and the baby back ribs were to die for.  Corn bread is basically as good or better than cheddar biscuits at Red Lobster and that is saying a lot.  Service was excellent and our waitress was very attentive.  If you love BBQ, this place showed why it's rated so high.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Not the best BBQ I have ever had, but it is pretty darn good.

Because it is not really obvious from the street, we overshot Bobby Q and had to do a turnaround in quite a sketchy strip mall a couple of blocks up. Half expecting a total dive we were pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant itself nicely appointed.

Before we even ordered our food a tasty basket of cornbread was brought to the table. We ordered a sampler plate containing 3 different meats - pulled pork, brisket and St. Louis ribs as well as a BBQ chicken sandwich. We couldn't decide on which sides to select but when our server brought us a sample of the mac & cheese to try our minds got made up in a hurry.

On the sampler plate the St. Louis ribs were terrific, the pulled pork was not too bad but the brisket was kind of dry. Fortunately the server had brought large containers of 2 types of BBQ sauce to our table so we were able to moisten the brisket with the sauce. The chicken on the sandwich was moist but I found the sauce a little too mild and sweet.

The service we received was friendly and attentive and the little doughnuts in the to-go bag was a nice touch.  Overall, worth a repeat visit if we are in the area. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Traveling all day looking for somewhere to eat, we stopped here taking a risk as to what we would get.  It was after 9pm and we were not expecting much.  I was extremely shocked at the quality in a great way.  It was so good that i had to come back a second time while i was in Phoenix.  
The service was amazing and the food was tasty.  The first night i had the pulled pork with mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was amazing.  The second night i had the beef brisket and mac and cheese.  I cant remember the other side i had because the mac and cheese was that good.  
On the first night after eating, we were given a complimentary desert, not sure the name of it, but it was amazing.  And then the little doughnuts were the next arrival.  They are hot and ohhh so good.  A great finish to a great meal.  
I will go back again and send others to eat here."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and their house beer is possibly the best beer I've ever had!  Rebecca was our server. She was very helpful as it was our first visit."}
{"text":"We are out of town folks from CA & Hawaii & this is amazing BBQ. 2 of my colleagues had the rotisserie chicken and I had the 2 meat combination of Tri tip & ribs & the BBQ sauce was delicious and the meat tender. The portions were huge. Yummy onion ring block and we ended the evening with ice cream in a hot apple cobbler. Must come back when I visit Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"One of the best bbq restaurants that I have ever been to. There is always a long wait, but the staff was able to help us find a table at the patio. I think the patio is better than inside because it's spacious, and there are mist to cool the temperature off. We ordered Hog Heaven, fried onion rings and couple drinks for four of us, and we couldn't even finish all the food. 

Corn breads are delicious and just like the ones I had in North Carolina. It's not too sweet, outside of corn bread is a bit crispy and inside is soft. When you placed the butter on the top of corn bread, and the butter just melts right of away. This combination added extra flavor to corn breads. 

Whole Hog Heaven: beef ribs, pulled chicken, baby backs, prime briskets, mac & cheese, meshed potatoes, roasted corns. 

Man o Man, They are so delicious. briskets are moist and tender. you don't need to add any bbq sauce. Prime briskets are great to eat by itself. I like to eat mac & cheese after having briskets. M&C here are really good with a slide sweet taste in it. 

- Baby backs were cooked so well and the meat fell off the bones easily. 
- Pulled chicken was juicy and didn't have the dryness that chicken breasts usually have. 
- Beef rib is delicious and still attached to the bone, some people like it roasted so the meat would fall off easily. However, for me, I prefer to chew the bone. very yummy.

If you ever visit Phoenix, definitely stop by here and make reservation at least couple days ahead of time."}
{"text":"Guilty pleasure! The cornbread is so good, My bf and I seriously just ordered a bag of cornbread to take to his apt for dinner! LOL

Great customer service, this is one of those places where no matter what you try it's still going to be delicious."}
{"text":"Bobby Q is one of my favorite places to go whenever I have family or friends new to Arizona. It has fantastic, flavorful, smoky BBQ options in a clean spacious dining area. With all the choices and sides, it has something for all lovers of BBQ. 

My favorite starter is the Q-Rolls; but who could resist a crispy eggroll stuff with their delicious and tender smoked brisket. And usually we order the Whole Hog Heaven, which really is a feast for everyone eating it. You get to pick two ribs, two meats, and three sides. You cannot go wrong with anything you chose. I usually get the baby back ribs, St. Louis ribs, smoked sliced beef brisket, and smoked pulled pork with a side of sweet potato fries, pecan cole slaw, and mac & cheese. 

What I recommend:
-- Q-Rolls
-- Whole Hog Heaven
-- smoked sliced beef brisket
-- baby back ribs"}
{"text":"Bobby Q is the best BBQ restaurant in Phoenix. It is always a great meal whether at Lunch or Dinner.  Love those little donuts too!!"}
{"text":"The food and service were fantastic. We had a large group reservation and had many people not show. The manager and staff were so accommodating, understanding and kind. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yes!!!! Everyone's meal was soooooooooo good!!! I was a little worried about the area this restaurant was in and got a little worried about the signs in parking lot that they aren't responsible for theft in cars! Yikes is this a problem here? 

We decided to give it a try and we're glad we did stay!!!!  The mashed potatoes were sooooooooo good and so was the Mac n cheese! I highly recommend those sides!  The food was all amazing and they give you free donuts at the end! What what!!! How awesome!!!!  

We will visit again if we return to this area!"}
{"text":"This place is classier than your typical BBQ joint, which of course means just a little pricier.  But with the extra money comes high quality food.

My most recent visit, I ordered the brisket sandwich with shoestring fries, and was quite satisfied.  Service was fast and friendly, and the food was excellent.

First up was the cornbread, which was very flavorful and full of buttery goodness.  The meat was tender, juicy, and went very well with the regular barbecue sauce.  The fries were also good - I couldn't figure out what was special about them, but whatever it is, it works.

Overall, a very good place, highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of our family favorites!  Amazing food, and if you have Garrett, amazing service as well!"}
{"text":"We were very underwhelmed........the waiter went on about their meat is smoked for 18 hours,  thats bs........the baby back ribs were obviously boiled and maybe lightly smoked, the pulled pork had a very faint smoked flavor.  The side dishes were good, but the meat is ok at best, not real authentic bbq."}
{"text":"Love this family owned restaurant! Great service and best baby back ribs ever!!  My Texan husband agrees!!!"}
{"text":"Bobby Q is an up scale restaurant having delicious foods y romantic environment.This is a quality restaurant in all areas service is professional but very friendly to assist you w your order. I look foward to going back to Bobby Q for the Holidays they will be all festive can't wait. I have only given 4.5 stars . Because I never want a place to quit trying to keep their standards high. This is my highest rating. Because this place has earned it. Happy Holidays everybody be kind y share good will. Forgot Yes they do serve alcohol beverages.Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best BBQ in phoenix!  The platters are HUGE and the sides are all really good! (the mac and cheese is to die for!) Plus...free to-go donuts for dessert!"}
{"text":"Coming from LOs Angeles I really wanted to try some AZ BBQ. The place was very nice resembling Lucilles Bbq. We ordered the  hog heaven, and easily shared amongst 3 of us. It was very moist, and delicious I enjoyed the meat entrees very much. What I didn't care for was the Mac n cheese it was a little too velvetta for my taste. It resembled the Mac n cheese from KFC. The coleslaw was delicious as well as the baked beans. I would probably eat here again but keep in mind for peeps from Los Angeles it's comparable to claim jumper IMO. But the service was A+++ and family friendly atmosphere. But this is coming from a person who frequents Bludso's BBQ in Compton so I feel like I have higher standards. Lol but definetely worth a try."}
{"text":"You know how it is.. when your jones'n for something .. your just gonna have to find it.. ENTER yelp app on the iPhone! Boom .. Bobby Q's within 15 minutes of my home.. during the rain and the wind.. thats what I needed .. good old barbeque.. Really.. I couldnt decide how or what to order to get my comfort food on.. because that is the way the menu rolls.. Ended up with the 2 meat platter.. split with someone else.. salad on the side.. perfect.. pulled pork, beef brisket.. yum.. 
mashed potatoes are the kind grandma used to make.. 
my cohort in jones'n crime got her carb on with the mac/cheese.. (kind of velveety' for me..but still yummy).. 
AWESOME corn muffins.. 
Alfonso, our waiter.. the best Ive had in months:-) 
Oh yeah.. they love yelpers .. mention it.. see what you get:-)"}
{"text":"Love this place!! It was our first time here and we'll definitely be back. Great service, our waitress was super friendly and always checked in, and two managers stopped by to ask how we were doing. The food is incredible too, we loved the Q-rolls and also got the huge BBQ combo :) it's expensive, but tons of food! We both ate a ton and had almost a third meal left over."}
{"text":"As a Phoenix native, how the hell have I not been here before? Honestly, I skipped this place because I heard it was a club. And a BBQ place. But I've never heard of friends coming here for BBQ, only drinking. It's on a rough-ish side of town. WHY THE F*CK ARE THEY TELLING ME ABOUT DRINKING HERE AND NOT EATING? Skipped this place for years. Mistake. I recently started back up at school and had to drive down the i17 for many miles a couple times a week. I ride a motorcycle and never had to look at the signs when I passed this place. IT SMELLS SO F*UCKING GOOD!! I always knew when I was passing Peoria/Dunlap. I decided to have my birthday dinner here despite having never been before. I call the day-of my dinner and make a reservation for 20. No problem. They ask if I want separate checks while making reservations. Being in the industry, this is a good sign. They greeted us all with waters and we had two servers. We all get served basically at the same time. Impressive.  Best ribs I HAVE EVER EATEN, EVER. Dope. At this point I'm pretty hammered and totally feeling myself. They bring me a fuggin complementary  dessert with a candle and now I am vaguely remembering my friends signing to me...BUT I AM SO FULL. What the actual F*CK am I supposed to do with this ice cream? I take a bite and all of the sudden there are these little baggies of the best donut things I've ever put in my mouth. So hot and perfect and mushy and yum. I need to go back. Seems like a perfect place to grub and then party on. Next time I'll get less drunk at dinner and try to venture into the club scene they have. Hopefully it isn't too hood!! Lol"}
{"text":"Yooooo BBQ ribs is one of my fav foods. I've been to many places from Lucile's, Gus's BBQ, Bludsos, and to Phils BBQ. I have to say of all the BBQ joints this is the best one I've been to. 
I would highly recommend the BBQ platters from a two rib combo or three meat combo of your party is 2-3 ppl. My dad went to town on the meats and I cleaned house on the ribs. I normally prefer baby back (usually my favorite) but the St. Lois ribs were especially good here. I heard really good things about the Q rolls but unfortunately wasn't able to try it. If I'm ever in the area in AZ again, I will def make sure to come through again to try the Q rolls along and enjoy the most amazing ribs I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This place brings back some memories. It used to be the old Bobby McGee's themed restaurant, and I used to go on dates with my daughters when they were just little girls. It was dress up time with Dad, and they really enjoyed meeting the various servers that acted out their various personas. 

The last time I was here was a few months after they remodeled this place, and turned it into Bobby Q's. The food wasn't that impressive then; therefore, I never made it a point to return.

Due to an accident on the I-17, we had to make a detour on Dunlap to escape the traffic. Instead of having to endure a prolonged wait for dinner, we opted to give this place a try. I forewarned my wife that I didn't think that this place was any good, but we would give it a try anyway.

And we were about to be quite pleasantly surprised.

Riley, our server, greeted us with such enthusiasm and made compelling statements  about how amazing this place was. #89 in the country as far as BBQ joints are concerned, and over 1100 reviews on Yelp. 

His statements were received with some trepidation by yours truly, and in my mind, I was saying to myself - we shall see!

My wife ordered the Wood Fired Top Sirloin Steak, and I ordered the 3 meat combo (Pork, Brisket, and Chicken). For our drinks, we ordered the sweet tea.

The tea was just wonderful. Not too sweet and not too tart, and had zero after taste. Just the way the both of us like it. 

We were provided with fresh homemade cornbread that was just pure evil! They were absolutely and ridiculously delectable. You could just taste the sweetness, along with all the calories and the carbs! A caution sign should accompany these babies.

In spite of the myriad of people eating here; especially the two large parties that apparently were part of some spring training tour group, the service was prompt and efficient. 

Nary an empty moment went by without Riley continually checking in on us and apprising us of our meal's status.

Not too terribly long afterwards, our meals were presented to us.

My wife really enjoyed her Sirloin Steak, and she was quite impressed with the roasted corn that came with it. And the generously lavish heap of shoe string fries made a great accompaniment to her already delicious meal.

My 3 meat BBQ combo was quite heavenly. The smoked meats were very tender, and the sampling of the various BBQ sauces provided just brought out their flavors even more.

In the middle of us enjoying our meal; Renee, the manager stopped by and checked in on us as well. She was engaging and quite friendly. She even helped clear our table as we progressed through our dining experience.

And when we were all done, Riley spent a few moments recapping our experience.

We had nothing but great things to say about the service and their food. Both were thoroughly enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Love good BBQ and really love this place! We had lunch, got there a little late, 12:40pm, so not a huge crowd. Waitress was fun, helpful for first timers. We both had the 3 meat lunch with one side. I had chicken, St. 
Louis ribs, and brisket. Wife ordered brisket, pork, and St. 
Louis ribs, she had the mac and cheese for her side. I could not decide on potato salad or cole slaw, our waitress brought me both! All the meats were some of the very best, the brisket better than any I have ever had. Ribs were good, have had some close, but not quite as good as Bobby's. Chicken was very moist and tender. Corn bread was very good, came with whipped butter but did not need any on it, it stood alone like a champ. The only item that was not absolutely best was the pork. It was good, just not over the top like the other choices. Their potato salad is the BEST, we always measure the salad against MIL's, and this was close. Cole slaw was standard fare with chopped pecans, not a big chopped pecan fan, so I didn't really care for it, was just standard old cole slaw, nothing \"special\". We also got a personal visit from the manager, she was very friendly and sincere. All in all, LOVED IT and will go back."}
{"text":"The best BBQ place west of Dallas TX.  Ask for spicy BBQ sauce. If you order roasted corn no or easy butter. Corn bread was good as well."}
{"text":"Brisket is ok, sauce is decent and atmosphere is a little hood come 8pm. I dined here over the weekend Bc I was to lazy to fire up my grill (way to humid out) so I went here w/ my bro Rob and was hoping for some goodness. I don't think I'd eat here again since its not my idea flavor/taste of BBQ. Don't let my review steer you away from trying it though, everyone has their own preference when it comes to BBQ so I'd try it and go from there.
Official rating,
Food: ***
Customer service: **** (manager very sweet , waitress was su-lOh!)

Drinks: *** (Sangria was ok, beer a little warm)"}
{"text":"Always stop here when out for the races ! Great food best smoked sausage ever! Always ask for Jessica great person and very friendly"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! I'm usually not a fan of BBQ, but I think it's because I've only had subpar barbecue up until now. My boyfriend on the other hand, always has an appetite for the sweet and savory goodness that it offers.

Take out was quick and we were out the door in 15 minutes, despite a packed house. Service was very friendly too.

I'd recommend the brisket and baby back ribs. My boyfriend said the St. Louis ribs were just ok. The sides were equally delicious! The mac and cheese + cornbread (complimentary) were my favorites!!!

Compared to Phil's BBQ, our party agreed that Bobby Q's is much tastier. 

Next time we'll opt to dine in, and I'd like to try the bread pudding as well!"}
{"text":"I love Bobby Q and can't believe I haven't been here in over 5 years!  We brought some out of town family to enjoy some great BBQ.  I enjoyed the rotisserie chicken with a side of roasted corn and mac 'n cheese - wow, that was amazing!  The cornbread they serve should be illegal...it is that good.  I love that they make homemade donuts as you walk in/walk out and they give them to you at the end of your meal.  Bobby Q's has a really nice atmosphere and the service is great too!"}
{"text":"Originally, we weren't planning to go here, but as we kept on passing it by from other places to our hotel, I yelped it see what their rating was. It surprised the hell out of me to find out they averaged 4.5 stars. Now, me and Kathy are huge BBQ fans and wanted to balance out our weekend with a meat splurge. We decided dinner was going to be how it was going down...

Again, the stoopid Google Maps app fails us again and has us feeling our way to Bobby Q. We finally get there and got sat down immediately. We got served a basket of cornbread that looked like hockey pucks. There was a crunchy texture on the outside, while the inside was moist and fluffy. It was spectacular, but don't fill up on them, unless you are on a diet and weren't ordering anything else. I'm usually skeptical of ordering brisket, unless I know there was some Texas affiliation. Lots of the Yelpers raved about the brisket and when the waitress recommended it, it was a no brainer. What was difficult was what else to order.

We settled on the the Whole Hog Heaven, after much debate between me and Kathy and interrogation of the waitress. The Whole Hog Heaven is their best feast where you can choose 2 BBQ meats and 2 pit ribs types, plus 3 sides. We went with brisket, smoked sausage for the meats and St Louis ribs and Texas beef ribs. For the sides, we ordered the mac n cheese, roasted corn and shoestring fries.

First off the bat, the brisket was as good as advertised by Yelpers (thanks, y'all) and our waitress. Juicy, moist and tender with a smoke crust gives the brisket an unforgettable experience. Another winner was the St. Louis ribs. It literally fell off the bone and was oh so tender. The sausage was good, but not outstanding and the beef rib was also just acceptable. Against the waitress' suggestion for their \"smoasted\" chicken, I do think I will try the smoked roasted chicken and the baby backs next time. All of the sides were tasty, but the stars were the brisket and St. Louis ribs.

To top off a grand BBQ evening, we were given a brown paper sack of mini donuts that were sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. That's a nice touch. Overall, I give Bobby Q a solid 4 stars on the basis of the brisket. You can have a brisket sandwich and die happily, and yes, its that good! The service was good and the food came out fast. 

I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu. There was a couple next to me,  who ordered enough for a small army. The guy raved about how the Southern Fried Chicken was the best he had ever had. The dude looked like a food heavyweight, so he must have had a few country fried chicken in his lifetime, so I'm adding that to the list.

Until next time, BBQ compadres..."}
{"text":"Went here for a date night. My fiancé and I were impressed by the decor. Call ahead to get your self on a waitlist! The drinks were great. The food was pretty salty for our taste, even the appetizers. Our waiter recommended the q-rolls, ruined our appetite for dinner and both of us thought it wasn't great as the waiter hyped it up to be.  The ribs and chicken were the best part. Good over all but don't think we would come back, again everything was way too salty! Would be nice if they added healthier sides maybe a collard green or side salad option instead."}
{"text":"This place was the worst food and service. The waitress was rude and the manager was worse"}
{"text":"This is my first time in this place. I was looking to take my family for the sunday's lunch and we wanted a texan food. Our first option closes in sundays, so we picked this place with no higher expectatives. I was completely wrong:

All the staff was friendly. They set up a table for us in a minute, the place gave me a good first impression. Since we have 3 kids (1,3 & 5 yo) we selected the typical brisket and susage with sides (grill veg, mac & cheese and potato with bacon) My wife and I shared the orders witht the kids. All the orders were served in less than 10 minutes. 

Honestly I was expecting to pay close to $ 50, my suprise was that all this costs 31, I put down an extra tip for all the good service, food and the place itself. 

I score 5 stars for this place."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and we know good BBQ.  So take it from me it's Gooooooood.   I had the Brisket and Baby Backs which was so tender."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  The Hostess, Waitress and Manager were all friendly, helpful and attentive.  I had the rib eye - tasty and cooked as ordered.  My friend had shrimp chimichurri - she really liked them.  The free donuts were delicious."}
{"text":"Would give them 10 stars if I could. Went here for dinner on our way back from Grand Canyon and the positive reviews do not disappoint. My husband and I shared \"The Whole Hog,\" which comes with a choice of two ribs, two meats, and three sides. Our favorites were the St. Louis ribs and the brisket! Super tender and juicy and not fatty or gristly. Everything is so good here. Also great service. Wish we lived nearby but will longingly wait for a location in LA."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times it has proven to be hands down best BBQ I've had. mind you I've never had Texas BBQ but this has set a high bar for me. the whole hog heaven is way too much for 2 people but perfect for 3-4 people! Best brisket, and Ribs!"}
{"text":"Great food great service fast fresh my wife and I visited this location March 8th Potter was our waitress fast friendly food blew our minds we've been to lots of BBQ spots in Phoenix but this is the best we had q rolls for appetizers they were great and hot we got the hog heaven for main came out hot and on time corn bread kept coming so did the drinks corn bread was to die overall slap yo momma food will be returning on pay day lol"}
{"text":"We were traveling through Phoenix on Father's Day and I was trying to find something great for my dad. Yelp led me to Bobby Q as it was close to my hotel. The hour and a half wait time given made us question for a minute but we decided to stay. Best choice ever! Only waited about 20 minutes and had one of the most amazing meals ever. Although they were packed, the service was great! In fact we decided to come back a week later on our way back home. We made a reservation this time but didn't really need it at 5:30 on a Monday evening. Food was still remarkable, Ashlynn was a wonderful server, and we cannot wait to go back again on our next trip through town. We had prime rib both times, corn, baked potato, Mac and cheese, and the Q rolls which are sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Duuude! The hamburger here is one of the best in the Valley. I forgot which Yelper recommended it to me, but he was right. Just very good, high-quality ingredients -- and the right amount of them. Soft, flavorful bun. Fresh, hand-formed, patties. Mmmm!

Oh yeah, the BBQ here is good too. Their sauce is great; and they serve it in heated containers so it doesn't get your food cold. Try the BBQ Chicken sandwich -- with fries or coleslaw because both are top notch.

Lastly, if you check in with your phone, you'll see a 10% discount to Yelpers if you mention it."}
{"text":"The Best BBQ Ribs restaurant I ever been to, hands down.  Love this place!!!  If I had a lot of money and time I would drive all the way from Glendale, CA to Glendale, AZ every month just to come to this place.  Think about opening up a new restaurant here in LA.  You would be welcome!!  Love you guys.  Great service, lovely décor, fantastic and mouth watering food.  Fall off the bone tender meat.  The side dishes were outstanding and well prepared with excellent recipes.  They were so tantalizing, fresh and plentiful.  Don't forget to grab a strawberry lemonade (Hold the sugar on the rim, though---Sugar Overload!!!!)."}
{"text":"My family and I were itching to try something new for dinner, and my mother suggested barbecue. We went to azcentral.com and found the reviews for Bobby-Q and decided to give it a whirl. I can tell you, we were not disappointed. The portions were huge (enough for lunch tomorrow) and our waiter, Alonso, was incredibly knowledgeable about not just the food but the history of Bobby-Q as well. When we first saw the prices, they seemed a little steep, but after we saw how much food we got, it was perfect. And, at the end, we got a bag of donuts that are made fresh in-house, and WOW, they were reminiscent of a delicious churro! Overall, it was really superb, and we will definitely be coming back AND recommending it to our friends!"}
{"text":"Okay based on the abundant reviews we decided to try the lunch menu. I had first thought of ordering the whole hog heaven but didn't think there would be enough for four so we each ordered individual meals. I had the soup and slider. I had the baked potato soup with a brisket slider. The soup was good not as thick as  others I have tried and the slider was awesome. The roll was nicely toasted and a good portion of brisket. I should have asked for extra sauce as my sandwich went dry halfway through.  My family ordered the the catfish po boy kids chicken finger,jumbo bbq potato,sampler platter and a brisket platter. The only complaint we had was on the brisket platter.... Small potion for the pride. Overall there was a vote at the table on how bobby q fared against another famous bbq place and the results were... Cornbread... Bobby q.... Mac n cheese ... FD.... Tea... Bobby q... Brisket .... Split soup Bobby q and fries split. Overall for a family of six we would probably go back to the famous platter of meats and fixings but I enjoyed the service and food today at Bobby Q's."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork and Mac/cheese. Very yummy. 

Strawberry lemonade very tasty too. Nice decor/ambiance and very friendly service.

My first official food consumed in Arizona - it was a fine choice!!!

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Bobby Q is a unique property, in which one side is a Barbecue restaurant and the other is a music venue. A couple weeks ago, we celebrated a co-worker's birthday here, and although we were outside when it rained, we didn't have to worry about getting soaked. The beers were quite tall, and the food was excellent! Along with ordering the pulled pork mini-burritos and wings, we were also given small sacks of fresh cooked mini-donuts. Nowhere have I gone to, have those been served; you wouldn't think of a BBQ place serving such delectable little donuts!

In regard to the music, I can't say I've been there but did have a DJ friend there recently headline there for a Thursday night. The set up looks good, for being outside of Downtown Phoenix and Old Town Scottsdale.

Can highly recommend if not for the BBQ, at least for the small sacks of fresh donuts!"}
{"text":"Brisket was amazing. Best barbecue I've ever had and I have had a lot of A lot of barbecue. Staff is in credibly friendly service was good and bartender was on point."}
{"text":"Good Food.  I had the smoasted chicken. Smoked and roasted.  It was good.  My son's had ribs and ribeye.  All the food was cooked to our liking. Everything tasted great.  The restaurant was clean, noisy, cool decore.  We had an excellent meal in which someone else treated us to.  This place is just a little out of my budget especially feeding my boys who alway spring for the ribs and steaks."}
{"text":"This place is great! I had prime rib yummm plus great service. I'm a big fan now. Me and my husband went there for our anniversary and both loved it. The area isn't great but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"This place puts me into a pretty good meat coma every single time I go.  I blame the restaurant.  The food is so good that I can't stop shoveling it into my face, even when I know it's quitting time.  The brisket is the best I've ever had, excellent roast corn and mac and cheese, and strawberry colada is a total mouthgasm.  It's very cozy in the restaurant and nice and dark so that you don't have to be ashamed as you're smearing rib sauce all over your face.  But seriously....this is the best BBQ I have had in the Phoenix area so far.  So go!"}
{"text":"Our server Michael was awesome! He really knew his stuff and I would never have guessed he had only been there 2 weeks! We had beef ribs, pulled pork, baby back ribs and brisket. The food was amazing! If you want amazing service, ask for Michael!"}
{"text":"Solid four-star restaurant but not five. The beef brisket was the most flavorful brisket I've had in my entire life; A penetrating yet not overpowering smoky sensation.  However, I was disappointed with two of the three the barbecue sauces.  The \"regular sauce\" is sweeter than catch-up with just a little more sophistication.  The spicy sauce tasted more like corn syrup mixed with hot sauce.  However the Carolina sauce was a genuine flavorful masterpiece.  It's commonplace for vegetables in barbecue joints to be lackluster, but a four and one half star 800+ review restaurant should be an exception to the rule: it was not. On the more delectable side, we had the Apple cobbler for dessert -nine out of 10."}
{"text":"Ok this place is officially AMAZING! I always passed by on my way home from work and made it a point to open my window every time I pass by. I wanted a taste of that savory aroma passing through my nostrils. I've been budgeting and not going out to eat so much but today I was celebrating a personal accomplishment and thought \"why not?\" I'm so glad I stopped by for lunch. Once entering, the friendly staff showed me to a table, where the bartender-didn't catch his name, but was EXTREMELY friendly and helpful- suggested the sampler. In a sampler you get 3 meat options, 1 side, and cornbread. I ordered the ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and mac&cheese as my side. Service was quick and prompt, and let me tell you, those were probably the best ribs I have ever had. The brisket was flavorful, yet missed the mark a little there regarding texture though it was a bit tough(which is the reason for 4stars, not 5). Pulled pork was simply delicious. And the mac&cheese was super rich! I loved every bite! I did not leave empty handed either! fresh from the kitchen 1/2 dozen cinnamon sugar doughnuts right out the door. This place is so welcoming and delicious I wouldn't mind coming again with a party."}
{"text":"An excellant choice for a family looking for great prices ,great staff, great manager ,great food ,great manager ,its a10 ,a 10, yes a10, the interior and patio dining are awsome,we loved it ,will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Hi, 
I visit Bobby Q on 7-19-2011 after reading the good reviews about this place, so I want to check it out myself since I'm from Texas.  I ordered a Whole Hog Heaven for me and my hubby with bottle of wine, and for my daughter I ordered the pull pork sandwich.  Alright people, the barbeque was ok and for the people who have dentures this is place for them.  The ribs, meat melt of the bone alright but it's too mushy.  I can't even pick up the bone because the mushy meats just melt in the tray.  Good bbq ribs, meat should attach to the bones when you break it and melted in your mouth when you eat it that's call good bbq people.  Their pull pork was good and their corn bread was delicious seriously, but the brisket was too dried and the meat is brownish like old meats.  After tasting the brisket I just stop eating my dinner.  Lucky I had a bottle of wine.  Good brisket supposed to be little char on the outside, pinkish inside, and juicy.  Barbeque sauce normally served on the side because the good briskets meats are juicy and tender; therefore, the sauce doesn't need to poor all over the brisket.  Our server was alright doesn't know much about wine though, but I can't complaints because I'm not at fine dining.  The ambience was ok, music ok, but menu little greasy and some bread crumbs in it that's not so ok to me.  The price is very cheap.  Quantity is beyond my expectation but need to work on quality of foods.  For three of us the bill comes to $86.37 including tips.  I hope this review help some of you, thank you!"}
{"text":"It was amazing, our server Bryce gave us a complimentary dessert because we celebrating a night out just the two of us! Great portions and great food. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I am NOT a BBQ lover, so when I give this place 4 stars, I mean it...it's pretty darn good. I've tried all the BBQ spots in the East Valley i.e. Joe's, Famous Daves and I am indifferent to them. A drug rep brought us catered lunch from Bobby Q's and I had never heard of it. They have received national awards for their food and apparently they won State Best Mac&Cheese. We had cornbread, mac& cheese, pulled pork sweet & spicy flavors, coleslaw, and salad. I tried really hard not to go back for seconds on the Mac & Cheese and Pulled Pork that was catered at our office, but I my will power cracked and I dove back into the M&C and pork. It is so good, the flavoring is on point, the coleslaw is crisp and not runny. I'm a fan for sure. If I'm in the area I will definitely try to check out the actual restaurant and take my family or friends there."}
{"text":"Love love love Bobby Qs
We go there as much as possible the food the service and the atmosphere at all top notch. We take our friends and family there as much as possible. We even took our employees there for a work party. Everyone loved it .. can't wait to go there agin."}
{"text":"Made me miss Kansas city. The meat melts in your mouth the vegetables where crisp and flavorful. Best barbecue I have tried in the valley. Service is fast and phenomenal. I would definitely will be coming for seconds"}
{"text":"Have only had the brisket and the mac n cheese. Constently cooked and service is good, cute waitstaff and quick service. Havent tried anything other than brisket sandwich and catfish fillets. Cocktail selection is blah, sugery and few craft beer selections. Always craving the mac and cheese tho! Been here too many times to count over at least 5 years"}
{"text":"We moved here over a year ago and have been looking all over the city for BBQ that reminds us of our old Kentucky home.

Well, it's safe to say we've finally found it. Holy mackerel! We absolutely adored our dinner here. Our server, Lorelei, was lovely, and the manager(?) who came by to check on us was equally as wonderful. 

We will DEFINITELY be back! We are in love"}
{"text":"Bobby Q has great BBQ at an reasonable price and above average portions.  You will not leave hungry.  

Don't let the exterior of the building fool you.  It looks ghetto and run down but I think that is the look that they want.  Once inside, it looks better and again the BBQ is delicious !

Friendly servers.  Complimentary donuts.  Yes, I'm a fan !"}
{"text":"Went during lunch time, it was the best bbq I've ever had! The St Louis ribs and mashed potatoes were amazing, the corn bread and mac n cheese were great. I'm from San Diego and was in Arizona for spring training I'm so glad I found this place. If I'm ever in arizona again I will make sure I stop here. It was heaven!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, fun atmosphere, great food!.. We loved the outside patio... even in August!! Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I visited Bobby Q's in March 2013. Let me just preface this review by saying I am not the biggest BBQ fan there is. I lean more toward the veggies when it comes to food preferences, and you'll certainly never see me eating ribs.

That being said, I LOVED Bobby Q's! I had a cheeseburger (yes, I do eat burgers), and it was downright delicious. Mac and cheese was amazing as well. My friend had the ribs and couldn't get over them.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love Bobby Q, glad they opened a location in the east valley. Used to drive over to the north Phoenix location, but not its right in the neighborhood. The wings are some of my favorites in town"}
{"text":"You have to put ratings in context. This is a BBQ joint and as far as they go, this is 5 star. 

Atmosphere is great, service is super and the food was tasty, prepared to order and perfect portion size. Great little extras - like Pecan Cole Slaw - who would've thunk. I ordered the ribeye steak and it was cooked exactly to order delivered with great sides. Great beer selection on tap and those donuts - warm, soft, sweet donuts. 

My only regret is that I didn't go sooner or more often on my trip. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue in Phoenix! Bobby Q is a great place to go for good barbecue in the Valley with authentic meats and extra touches to make everyone happy. They have a funky location off I-17 so you need to exit and drive the frontage road to find the place. Once you arrive, you will not only smell the smoke, but you will enjoy the unique decorations and friendly atmosphere. The restaurant is huge which is good for groups.

The baby back ribs were just amazing. Sweet, smoky goodness falling apart with all the fight long cooked away. They also serve brisket egg rolls, fall apart cornbread, and super cheesy mac and cheese. The Q Rolls were a special treat since the flavor of the meat survives the deep fryer and is a very unique item. The bag of fresh mini doughnuts at the end of the meal is a nice touch and a tasty ride home.

Their location is a little tough if you have to fight traffic on a weeknight, and there is really not much else around. Prices are a bit high, but you are paying for good barbecue. I really like this place and am glad to have it on my trips to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised to see how busy the restaurant was on a Monday evening but it was in the middle of Spring Training. The restaurant is much more franchise-y than I expected but it still has homey roots.

We ordered the three meat plate of St. Louis ribs, baby back ribs, and beef brisket with pecan coleslaw and baked potato. The meat is incredibly, incredibly tender. It ended being too soft for my preference but if you enjoy fall off the bone BBQ this is the place for you. The sides are delicious and go well with the food. We found the BBQ sauce way too sweet for our tastes. Service is fast and everyone working is very friendly. The little touch that was lovely are the cinnamon sugar donuts you get at the end of your meal. A nice treat to top off a pretty decadent meal.

I enjoyed the restaurant overall although it didn't fit my personal preferences. It's a fun place to check out when you're in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"So good! Stay there or take away the food is always good. It has a busy atmosphere, but it fits the place. I have not waited more than 15 minutes to be seated, even when they are busy."}
{"text":"My husband & I tried this while in Phoenix based on the Yelp ratings & reviews. We were not disappointed at all. We ordered the whole  Hog Heaven meal (baby back ribs, St. Louis, pork, brisket, cole slaw, mac & cheese, and mashed potatoes).  Our meal was just amazing. Service was great. Definitely planning on returning when in the area."}
{"text":"This place has some yummy bbq! Their Mac and cheese and cornbread were incredible! The service was great too! The only negative I saw with this restaurant was there were flies everywhere."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch during a long day on the road, and so glad we did! Atmosphere is just right for a much-needed break. Clientele appeared to be mostly working professionals on their lunch break. The free cornbread is the best I've had--fluffy, with the perfect amount of sweetness. I ordered the brisket sandwich w/ beans and wife ordered the St. Louis ribs lunch special w/ coleslaw; both meals were outstanding. Water was frequently refilled without having to ask. Waiter and manager were both very friendly. This is a well-run, well-led restaurant. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Amazing barbecue where they're known for their ribs and brisket. The Ribs were alright, but the brisket... delicious and tender. Corn bread served on the side compliments the BBQ cuisine but I didn't find it to be the best I've ever had; just OK. Something about the lack of heartiness of it threw me off. If you're in the mood for the richest mac and cheese you'll ever taste, grab a side. Soooo cheesy I felt like I had to take a break and eat my steamed veggies to prep my taste buds for more. Of course the french fries were tasty and mashed potatoes tasted like butter which is always a winner in my book. 
The place itself is located in a bit of a weird place; you'd never think it was there. But when you find it and go inside, the overall feel is very welcoming. When you walk in you'll notice a server frying up donuts. Not sure if you grab these on the way out or what but we asked the server about it and got some delivered to our table to share. Great food and laid back atmosphere. BBQ is top notch, try for yourself."}
{"text":"I just went here for lunch today after reading lots of good reviews. I have to say that I cannot argue with the great reviews. The atmosphere is fun and the prices were decent. I ordered the brisket with mac and cheese, BBQ beans, and pecan coleslaw. The hubby ordered the brisket, pulled pork, shoestring fries and roasted veggies. The meats was amazing, so tender and moist. The BBQ sauce had the perfect flavor, not too tangy but not too sweet, and also not too thick. And the sides, OMG sooooo good. The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy, the beans were sweet and meaty, and the coleslaw was creamy, refreshing, and the pecans were a nice contrast. The hub let me try his fries and although they were very small and thin, they had a good flavor and I loved that some were soggy (I love soggy, greasy fries). Oh and how could I forget, they give you cornbread cakes before your dinner arrives. They were very tasty. They also give you mini hot doughnuts with cinnamon and sugar at the end of your meal. They were good, however, a little dry. I think they could have used more flavoring in the dough or maybe some sort of icing to dip them in. My only other complaint is that our waitress was a bit slowing in refilling our water and bringing a box along with our check. I would say that this place definately lives up to the hype and positive reviews. However, living in Maricopa, it takes close to an hour to get to Bobby Q's. So I probably wont be driving out there just to eat at Bobby Qs but if I was in the neighborhood, I would definately make sure to stop  :)"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Second time coming here when visiting Phoenix. Corn bread they start the meal off with is delicious. 

The decor is great. A lot of effort went into it to make it look so nice inside. 

Would have gave it 5 stars but took about 30 minutes to get good out. Bbq never should take that long to serve. 

Meal was great and desert was even better. Service was good too.

Mini donuts at end of meal are the best."}
{"text":"Started with the Q-Rolls. Shredded BBQ Brisket inside flaky pastry. Great idea. Great with Chipotle sauce. I had Baby Back Ribs with a loaded baked potato and Mac 'n cheese.  Everything was prepared to perfection.  Oh....and the cornbread.....best I've ever had.

I would definitely return. I would also say Texas BBQ is the best. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Was in town for business and found this place on Yelp. Got there around 3pm and got seated right away. Got the following:

chicken tenders: very good. spicy bbq sauce was excellent
mac n cheese: excellent
mashed potatoes: pretty good

Prices were very reasonable and service was friendly and the food came out right away. Would absolutely return here."}
{"text":"This place looks great, its incredibly spacious, amazing southern decor, insanely clean bathrooms and extremely friendly people.

The food is incredible, especially their ribs, we did the HEAVENLY HOG which is supposed to be for 2 people but TRUST ME you need a third person to finish this off otherwise you will die driving back home due to the most incredible food coma of your life. The hog consists of 4 meats and 3 sides, the meats are plentiful and we got baby back ribs, st louis ribs, brisket, and sausage and sides were mac n cheese, string fries basically thin fries, and ranch beans which were basically pinto beans and some pulled pork inside (i didnt taste any ranch).

Baby back ribs were 5/5 for sure, super tender and fall off the bone type, one of the best i've ever had. St louis ribs were also 5/5 and slightly different flavor and has some of that cartilage but i dig that stuff so nom nom. The brisket was very lean and smoky on the sides, which some people like but I was eh about it, I think i just dont like brisket all that much in general unless its slightly fattier than usual so this one was just alright for me 3/5. The sausage is really interesting in that its a bit dry, but they have this marinade prior to it at least it tastes like it did and has a really smoky flavor which i thought was interesting but overall just decent, 3.5/5. The mac n cheese is some of the cheesiest/creamiest mac n cheese you will ever have it was seriously some of the best ever in my opinion and I dont usually even like mac n cheese 5/5. Beans were fairly standard with the pulled pork, good if you like pinto beans 4/5. The string fries could be better in that it was fairly standard fries but slightly hard, not really but just if i had to nitpick 3/5. Overall you get A TON of food for $48 and i highly recommend you have 3ppl eat it despite the menu saying 1 really person could consume this, highly unlikely unless you're a competitive eater. 

Complementary corn bread is given prior to the meal and IT IS THE BEST CORN BREAD EVER its so good that I forget why I used to hate corn bread. Oh right probably because just about everywhere else I've had it it was always dry and bland, but this place is the ultimate exception 5/5. Also after you pay you get complementary donut dessert and I think they say they bake that in house and its a super light, fits in the palm, a small super sugared donut and its also delish 5/5. I'll definitely come back here and probably one of my fav bbq places of all time."}
{"text":"My, oh my! Every once in a while you stumble across a gem when you're in another city. This gem was located right across the 17 freeway from our hotel in Phoenix

Saw this places' sign from the freeway and it looked intriguing. Not much on sweet style bbq sauce or brisket because I'm biased  (Raised on Eastern North Carolina style chopped pork) but this place was off the hook!

Walked in the door and told there was a 1 hour wait so we decided to wait. Found a spot at the bar so we decided against waiting and ordered our food from there. We started off with these apps they call Q-Rolls and they claim they're \"World famous\". Well, they deserve that title as far as I'm concerned. Bbq brisket rolled in pastry shells like taquitos with chipotle and bbq sauce for dipping. Mercy!!

For my entree, I had the St. Louis and baby back ribs with roasted corn and tater salad. The meat was super tender and falling off the bone. The waiter offered to bring 
me more sauce but it was super delicious just the way it was. Not a big fan of tater salad but this was great so I'm a fan of theirs. 

My wife had the fried catfish and same sides as me and she was well satisfied, She really don't like Bbq but she liked the taste of mine a lot.

DERN!!! I forgot to mention the cornbread! This is what bbq should be served with. Last, we finished up with the bread pudding. My wife said this was the best she ever had so that's saying something, Bread pudding is her favorite dessert and she never likes anybodys but her own.

This place was not completely laid back with paper towels and checkered table cloths but they weren't over-the-top fancy either. To me, a great place to drink a beer and bust the buttons on your britches."}
{"text":"A favorite of ours when we're up around North Phoenix.  We love the dry-rubbed-wood-smoked-tender barbeque meats!  For my hubby and father-in-law, myself and my son, we always order the Hog Heaven.  It is really enough or all of us!  You get 2 choices of meats and 2 choices of pit ribs with 3 sides for $36 dollars !  We get a few extra order of corn bread. The meat on the ribs literally fall off the bones and the brisket is soooo tender!  They have a KIDS MEAL menu, but my son loves the baby back ribs with the sweet barbecue sauce.  It really is the best in the valley that we have tried so far.  Dillon's comes a close second, in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place continues to impress.  I am compelled to write an update only to say at a recent visit we had one of the best dining experiences ever, anywhere.  

The food remains top notch, best quality, but the SERVICE... wow... they've always gone out of their way but this time the service was incredible.  Our server was on top of it 110%, the management came to make sure we were happy, I mentioned one small concern in passing and it was as if the place stopped for us.  No one rested until it was addressed.  I can't tell you how much we appreciate being... appreciated!

People say \"you drive all the way to 27th Ave & Dunlap from north Scottsdale to eat?\"  I say HELL YEAH we'd drive twice as far for great BBQ because it's hard to get the real thing like this.  Besides it's a matter of perspective, Phoenix metro area is small compared to Chicago.  The greater Chicago metro area is HUGE, it spans at least 6 counties.  We drive 55 miles each way for real BBQ back in IL.  And we're lucky to have it that close.

Oh yeah - for the first time we had the \"whole hog\" and it was an experience.  It was 2 meals for us, and the leftovers were just as good the next day."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. All the food is amazing!  I crave the corn and love the BBQ sauce. And don't forget the mini doughnuts for dessert! Great mood lighting and a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great layout, the place is great for getting together with friends, family or that one special person.
Love all your bbq, ribs are always a thing of beauty!"}
{"text":"Everybody's food was great and the waiter was very nice the service is awesome and I love how they give the little doughnuts at the end ! Great place to eat ."}
{"text":"Only good on Tuesday. Watch out for the door man with butter teeth!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the waitress was super nice! I would definitely come back and recommend it to other people!"}
{"text":"This is our third time to Bobby Q. My husband requested that we go there for his birthday dinner. I have to start by saying that told the hostess that it was my husband's birthday but nothing was ever said about it. I don't expect alot but a candle stuck in the mac n cheese or in a donut as acknowledgement that it was his birthday would have been nice. That said, our server, Zac, was lovely. Very attentive and pleasant. Clearly, the hostess just didn't bother to mention the birthday because I'm sure that Zac would have said something nice. He was great. The baby back ribs were yummy. Very fall off the bone. The mac n cheese is quite cheesy and I love the cornbread. On this occasion, we didn't have dessert because we were stuffed from ribs but I have had the banana dessert before and it is spectacular."}
{"text":"Wow! Didn't go here for a long time, because I didn't want to get sucked into another BBQ place that claims good, authentic BBQ. Now I'm upset I waited soooo long to try it. 

Started with some great warm cornbread. Perfect size for a pre-meal snack...and just the right amount of sweetness. 

I ordered the 3-meat combo, for only $3 more than the 2-meat...great value!  I weigh in at 315lbs...and I didn't even GET to the 3rd meat - way too full. I got brisket as one of the meats - honestly, tasted like it was right off the smoker...that's NEVER the case in BBQ joints, it's always dry and flavorless by the time it gets to the table - not here folks, may as well been eating it right from the pit. Very impressive. 

Sides: hats off to the Chef, FINALLY...a BBQ place that has crafted their sides to be as good as their meats. And a special mention...the mac & cheese had great flavor! I also got the corn...tremendous. Can't wait to come back to try the other sides...

Energetic atmosphere, great staff, and tremendous food at a good value. 

Thank You!!!"}
{"text":"This place needs a sixth star.  I'm impressed every step of the way.  Polite and helpful on the phone, personable and prompt waiters, perfectly portions cooked to perfection.  I've been to every BBQ place within 10 miles of home and I was very happy to have found Bobby Q's at 9 miles out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ place! Better then BBQ in Austin.  The brisket melts in your mouth and the bark is yummy and salty.  To die for! We will be going back for sure when we visit again for next year's baseball spring training! The chicken and sausage were good too.  I really liked the corn. They give you free corn bread while you wait. Austin was a great server.  He made sure we had everything we need and our cups were filled at all times."}
{"text":"I will definitely come back to this place again. I LOVE their BABY BACK ribs. Don't get the St. Louis style ribs unless you're the type that like lots of meat and less fat on your ribs.  Their ribs are juicy and tender. Their Strawberry lemonades are also very tasty. 
Our waitress was so nice and always checking up on us. She was also very helpful in giving tips on which ribs to get. 
I love the free cornbread and the donuts when you leave. :)"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, comfortable family atmosphere, service was spot-on and friendly (our waitress was Carmella). I visit mom in Phoenix at least once a year.  This place is going on our list of recommended restaurants to share with friends and family. I had the BBQ Brisket dinner with my 2 sides: the pecan cole slaw and beans. Although I usually tend to prefer hot BBQ sauce, I prefer the Carolina sauce - delish!!"}
{"text":"Bobby Qs is amazing. I loved the ribs and the Mac n cheese! The sweet tea was awesome too. Treat yo self and come eat at this place!"}
{"text":"Good service, decently priced, foods pretty quickly brought out! My boyfriend and I shared an entree with a two racks of ribs, and tri-tip! For our sides we had greens and sweet potatoes. Everything was delicious, very tender meat. And good flavor! Would come back-- haven't found a BBQ place out here that beats it yet"}
{"text":"Love this place. Excellent food. And for the best experience, sit outside on the patio. Amazing atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I recently tried the new Bobby Q and I wanted to try the original.  The outside is run down and off a side road, so get your GPS out if you are not from the area.  The hostesses were a bit chatty with each other and I decided to not wait for them to finish their conversation and went to the bar area to get food.

The bartender was a splendid and excellent waiter/host for us.  Great service all the way around.  They start with decent cornbread and then you have an extensive menu to choose something.

I do not know why people say this is a $$ place as it is $$$ to $$$$ depending what you order at a minimum overall.  This place is not cheap, however, it is worth giving it a whirl.  The salads were made exactly how we wanted them.  THe chicken was really moist for being a a breast.  The red potatoes are very good and the roasted corn have fantastic flavor.

To end dinner they give you some small beignets to eat.  So tasty and  nice way to end the meal.  The newer facility near the mall in PHX is MUCH nicer inside, however the food is consistant with quality and flavor.  Great place to go, however bring your wallett  :)"}
{"text":"One of my very favorite restaurants. The food is delicious and the service is always really good. Hubby and I were both craving the southern fried chicken since they didn't have that at the new location in Camelback (we went there about 2 weeks ago). Bobby Q never disappoints!!  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this restaurant often, the food is good yet pricey.  MY REVIEW INVOLVES The fact that my wife wanted to throw a graduation party for 30 people. The manager was non friendly and not AT ALL communicative with information, almost as if they didn't want our money or reservation. They offered us a small weeknight window, no menu suggestions, no flexibility.   

We have taken our party elsewhere to a restaurant That was happy to serve us and make an extra $1500"}
{"text":"Good BBQ west of Texas is simply hard to find. This is Tennessee style BBQ, slow cooked over Hickory. Definitely a carnivore spot!

The Q Rolls are excellent with the Chipotle dressing. Also, I really like the avocado salad with brisket. They'll bring you a side of Salsa and the Chipotle dressing which when mixed provide a creative dressing v the house ranch. 

Service is great and the ambiance is very nice."}
{"text":"Love this place! The restaurant bar is welcoming and a great spot to escape the fast pace of life. Try the happy hour menu... the brisket quesadillas are addicting."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect BBQ place .. every time I come it's excellent food I think is one of the top places to try in Arizona"}
{"text":"Big plates of food for a decent price. 
Brisket was ok, with a texture of pulled pork not brisket slices.
Sausage was ok.
But baby back ribs, by far, were the best. Tender and good flavor.
Cornbread was also great!
Might return if I was in town."}
{"text":"Fabulous service and food. A must if you're visiting the area. Get the baby back ribs and brisket. You will not regret it. Finish it off with a slice of Death by Chocolate cake. Very tasty. The house cocktails and lemonade was also very good."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place and their bbq ribs & sauce. I finally ate here and well...I rather go to famous dave's but their mac & cheese is good :)"}
{"text":"We found this place by accident, a very happy accident. The wait staff are very friendly and accommodating. The waitress we had was super friendly and helpful, she brought us samples of things we had questions about, etc. You receive a complimentary sweet cornbread circle for a starter, very tasty. The entree options are well rounded, there is something for everyone. The portions are huge, so be prepared! And at the end of the meal you are given a complementary mini donut covered in sugar. A great experience!"}
{"text":"Sooo glad we got a chance to try Bobby Q while visiting Arizona!

First and foremost, their service was incredible. I called in 45 minutes before and booked a reservation for Sunday night. Upon arrival, they greeted us warmly and seated us right away at a comfortable booth. Hunter, our server, was awesome. He was super friendly and helped us make our dinner choices. 

My boyfriend and I shared the Wedge Salad and the 3 Meat Combo - St. Louis Ribs, Baby Back Ribs, and the Brisket. The Wedge Salad was really fresh and refreshing (but not the healthiest since it comes with a pile of fried onions, but I'm not complaining!) All the meats were fall-off-the-bone tender and the bbq sauce was on point. For the sides we had the Baked Beans which were perfectly sweet, and the Mac n Cheese which I could probably have done without but it was okay. 

I couldn't have been happier with the meal and service but then they come with a bag of HOT FRESH donuts on the house. Wow...talk about cherry on top. You guys definitely made my night! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"The best corn ever! Had the 14oz ribeye and it was great as well. The wife had pulled pork and loved it. We were driving down 17 and were hungry from our trip to the Grand Canyon. Looked over and saw this place from the Freeway and just had to stop. Prices are reasonable and the service was just right. No complaints."}
{"text":"Love their Mac and cheese. Also their barbecue ribs are really good. Very good price and good service it is always so packed."}
{"text":"My mouth is sayin' yeeee hawwww howdy partner!  

My wife and I split the 3 meat combo with chicken, sausage and the lip smack baby backs.  The side were the roasted corn and ranch beans.  This was plenty of food. 


Service was great. Really appreciated the manager coming by twice to check on us."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom while we were in town for work and wanted to try something locally owned. 
First of all, the staff are the nicest people! Our waitress was Nikole, and although it was a little hard to hear her, she was the most upbeat and sweet girl we've ever had as a waitress. 

The food was amazing! The meats were great, and the sides were just as good. The ambiance was really nice. Kind of like an upscale BBQ joint. Plenty of choices for all types and it came to our table before we could even finish our cornbread. 

All in all an excellent dining experience"}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed this place. Very reasonable priced for the amount of food. Had to sit in bar due to business but found a seat right away. Ordered appetizer and drinks. Q-rolls were delicious as well as spinach artichoke queso. There was a bit of a mix up when finally seated  (much faster than 45 minutes quoted). No one notified server so took a bit before got assistance. For our inconvenience they comped an appetizer. (We still had drinks and appy from bar so truly didn't feel too inconvenienced, but I consider that great customer service. 
Had the 3 meat combo brisket, baby back ribs and pulled pork. All were excellent but the brisket was a standout. Mac and cheese was very creamy and delicious, baked beans above average. 
Will be back!"}
{"text":"Was in the Phoenix area and had heard about this place and we decided to give it a try. We weren't disappointed. The service was extremely good, the BBQ was exceptionally good, and the food was reasonably priced. I wouldn't hesitate to try this place again."}
{"text":"I love this place more every time I come here. The service is great, the food is spectacular, and the atmosphere is fun. I've been coming here for years and will continue to come back. This specific time in, I brought a colleague from out of town. She loved the selection of beer and really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Probably the best brisket I've ever had!!!!! Amazing food and the drinks are good too. The free bag of mini doughnuts you get after your meal are so yummy. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"This food was amazing! I loved the brisket appetizer and their cocktails were to die for. I cannot wait to move to Phoenix to eat here more often. The outside atmosphere was amazing and so comfy! I think I found my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've worked in the restaurant business for seventeen years.  I just moved to Glendale, and went out with my family to a local place with great reviews.  The food and service didn't disappoint.  Both were excellent.  Sabrina was awesome, especially with my 7 year old niece.  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Probably the best BBQ place I've ever eaten at and this includes Phil's BBQ in San Diego.

I ordered the Whole Hog Heaven and everything was perfect. Love the BBQ sauce, the ribs (even the beef) were fall-off-the-bone. The sides were great as well. Lots of food for the money.

Service was very friendly and even the manager was checking up on us.

The interior and exterior of the restaurant are also very nice."}
{"text":"Thank you Bobby  and all your wait staff for making our Westside UYE a  great time ..Sawyer and her little busy helpers  kept us happy .  The food was tasty , smoky and  down home yummy..
Great seeing some many Yelpers  just hanging out and enjoying some good food..."}
{"text":"Try saying Bobby Q three times really fast in a southern accent. It sounds like you're saying Barbeque.

I can't believe that I've been living in this area for a few years and I just started patronizing Bobby Q's. There's definitely a happening vibe to this place after dark. The place is packed and the air is buzzing with conversations and laughter. They have ample seating inside and outside. We met some friends that have never been here a few weeks ago and they became instantly hooked.

We ordered steaks, pulled pork, ribs and brisket. Everything along with the sides were fabulous. My brisket was tender and the flavor instantly transported my taste buds to a happy place. The pulled pork was equally as good. I've had the ribs on other trips to Bobby Q and have always enjoyed them. I got a big thumbs up on the steak from my dining companion so I'm going to have to try that next time I'm in the house. The tab for four people without alcohol and before tip was $70. 

This is definitely my favorite BBQ place in the metro area."}
{"text":"According to Tripadvisor Bobby Q is the Highest Rated BBQ in Arizona. Bobby Q is a very large old fashioned looking restaurant. I don't know how old it is but to me it looks a hundred years old with Giant Old Trees shading the parking lot. As you walk in you do get hit with an aromatic BBQ aroma. 

We were quickly seated and our server gave us a fast run down on Bobby Q. We learned that everything is made in house and the meats are smoked with mesquite wood. They also start everybody out with what I recognize as Johnny Cakes with soft whipped butter.

I had the BBQ Pulled Chicken Sandwich with Pecan Cole Slaw. The Chicken was falling apart tender and laced with sweetness but not too much. A small amount of skinny fried onions were added to my sandwich on a soft grilled roll. The coleslaw was drip free and fresh and crunchy.

My husband had a much better value item called the lunch sampler plate with 3 meats and a side. He enjoyed everything. I tried a taste of the brisket and for me it was too succulent and fatty but for my husband who likes fat he thought it was just right. My husband ate the macaroni and cheese I have to say it tasted like processed cheese. I didn't like the macaroni and cheese but I know most people do like this style. My husband liked the beans too he said they were packed with all kinds of meat ends.

When you're all done they present you with a bag of Fresh Made Thank \"Q\" Cinnamon  Sugar Donuts.

Not my stye of BBQ but I still thought it was good and plan to return for dinner."}
{"text":"Form Texas and was not in the mood for bbq but decide to try it. Bobby Q was incredible. Food great, service great and the feel of the place was great. The bbq is just as good as the best bbq house, Hutchins in McKinney TX"}
{"text":"Best pulled pork ever and Bobby even stopped by our table to check on us!  Will be returning the next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Seriously the best bbq I've ever had. Came from out of town and was shocked to find out how good this place was. Meat on the ribs was falling off the bone. The beef brisket was extremely tender and cooked to perfection. The Mac and cheese is to die for. Really rich and creamy. You won't regret coming here at all. So sad that I have to go back home and not have one of these places nearby. 
Also, phenomenal service. Really nice to notice that the manager, Taylor, took the time in between delivering plates out to stop by tables and check in."}
{"text":"Bobby Q has a rustic, Western vibe with a music selection customary of a traditional BBQ joint. The play on words for the restaurant's title was what caught my attention but I came into Bobby Q with my sister and boyfriend since we were craving some good BBQ. 

We ordered the Cajun Shrimp appetizer to start. The shrimp is sauteed in beer; this was the standout factor for me in this dish because I could actually taste the flavor of the beer, which complemented nicely with the Cajun seasoning and butter. 

We ordered the Full Baby Back Rib BBQ Platter to split 3 ways. You can choose from a list of sides such as mac and cheese, shoestring fries, ranch beans, mashed potatoes and pecan cole slaw. We decided to get mac and cheese and shoe string fries. I was expecting to be given additional plates to pick off the rib platter but our waitress was kind enough to have the kitchen split the dish on 3 separate plates, with a portion of mac and cheese and shoe string fries on each plate. Right when I started cutting my ribs, the meat fell cleanly off the bone. The 22 hour smoking process yields amazing results because the meat was moist, tender and just plain heavenly! The BBQ sauce was tangier than most but was delicious. My sister even loved the ribs and she's not a huge meat person. 

Lastly, what made the experience worthy of the 5 star rating was the service. The service was PHENOMENAL! Our waitress, Kessa, was informative on the restaurant's history (they used to be Bobby McGee's!) and their smoking process (the meat is smoked for up to 22 hours). In addition, the manager/restaurant owner personally came up to our table to see how we were enjoying our food. Our waitress was also sweet enough to bring us a half dozen complementary cinnamon donuts to end our meal!"}
{"text":"We JUST finished an amazing dinner at Bobby Q tonite.  We are in town for a week from Southern CA for a baseball tournament for my son & looked to Yelp for a top BBQ joint in town that we don't have in our neck of the woods.  We hit a grand slam choosing Bobby Q.  From the minute we sat down, our waiter Tommy (who was fantastic), told us the history of the place, made recommendations for us & was very attentive the entire meal.  The cornbread muffins were delicious.  We ordered the Q rolls & spinach artichoke cheso dip as appetizers.  The Q rolls were AMAZING - highly recommend.  The spinach dip was very good, especially when I asked for tortilla chips instead of the bread that comes with it.  For our meal we got the big \"Hog Meal\" I think it was called.  You get to choose 2 types of ribs (a full rack), we got a full rack of baby back, 2 types of meats (1 lb), we chose brisket & pulled pork & 3 sides but we chose 4, coleslaw, mac n cheese, fries & roasted corn.  BY FAR the best meat was the baby back ribs.  The bones were just there for looks cuz that meat FELL OFF THE BONE.  They were so good.  The pork was tasty too, brisket was our #3 favorite but very tender.  The coleslaw is delicious, my son loved the mac n cheese & fries & the corn was smokey yummy tasting too.  At the end, when they bring the bill, they bring these SINFUL homemade donuts with the check.  OMG!!  They were so good.  I had to get a second little bagful on the way out.  We also bought the sauce they use.  They sell it if you loved it.  We loved it.  Definitely recommend this place.  Our waiter Tommy made our experience here awesome.  Drinks were good, service good, food good.  5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Good service, good food, good drinks! Jessica was so helpful and friendly. Enjoyed having her as our server!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, I was with a large group who all appeared to enjoy their meals.  SO this is solely based on my palate.  I was starving after drinking my glass of wine at the bar.  I ordered the Grilled Top Sirloin with a 1/2 Rack of Baby Back Ribs.  Sides were baked potato (they forgot my sour cream and were so busy I didn't have the heart to ask for it..so that's on me), pecan coleslaw and potato strings (what was I thinking with already having the baked potato?)  

Anyway, things arrived and the plate so full I didn't know where to start so move things aside and attempted to cut my steak.  It was cold.  It was also SO tough it took a number of tries for me to cut it.  My husband offered to cut it but I was determined!  The one bite I finally got off was tough and chewy.  The smoke flavoring overpowered it.  So I was done with the steak.  I then tried the ribs.  The meat fell off the bone and was extremely tender.  I did find them tasty but could only eat a couple due to the salt content.  Too salty for me.  I'm not sure if it was the sauce or if they use a rub, but it was overwhelming.  The pecan cole slaw was ok...I expected better.  It needs pineapple  :)    I didn't eat the fries as they were cold by the time I got to them.

Thankfully there was plenty of cornbread on the table which was amazing.  I wish I would have ordered some to take home. 

Would I go back?  Yes, but to try some other items like maybe Bob's Salad.  Sounds really good.  I don't think I could eat the meat again because of the salt and overly smokey flavor.  
The donuts at the end were evil...so maybe I'd go back for cornbread and donuts with a side salad. lol

My BIG complaint is our servers when bringing the receipts were really flustered.  I had two servers arguing behind me about things being wrong.  That is unprofessional and unnecessary around your customers.  I held my tongue but it was difficult.  If you have problems with your receipts...take it away from  your customers to sort it out.  I have no problem reiterating what I had and you can ring up a new receipt to get it clear and most people at our table would have felt the same way.  Again, DO NOT ARGUE in hearing distance of your customers.  It can ruin a nice evening for us.

Anyway, many of the friends with us loved their meal and I know Bobby Q's is a favorite for some.  Unfortunately I am not one of them."}
{"text":"Excellent place! Like theirs steaks and ribs.

Based on recommendations visit on lunch was awesome"}
{"text":"Been going to Bobby Q's for years.  Love the lunch atmosphere, and specials.  The Mac 'n Cheese has always ranked at the top of my lists as the very best ever!  The pulled pork and brisket have always been excellent, but this last time I tried something different - a burger!  Yeah, I know, this is a BBQ joint, why would anyone get a burger?

Well, I am glad I did!  Like the Mac 'n Cheese, this burger is now at the top of my list!  It was sooo... damn... good!!!  The \"Perfect\" burger was just that  - perfect!  I ordered the meat medium and that was how it came out. The meat was amazingly tender with incredible flavor. It would be really hard to find better.  Maybe the only burger I've ever had better was at Carver's Steak house where they made my son a Whiskey Peppercorn burger that was not on the menu.  At Bobby Q's, I could only eat 1/2, and the next day my reheat was still amazingly good!

We also tried their beef brisket flour taquitos that were insanely delicious as an appetizer!  Later that evening we went to the Yard House at Westgate and I tried their famous Vampire Tacos - they weren't as good as these beef brisket taquitos at Bobby Q's.  Thumbs up to Bobby Q's.

People love the cornbread here too!  Baked in cast iron, it has an incredible crust.  Still, personally, I liked the Old El Paso BBQ Company's cornbread, but they no longer exist here.

I got to say - I love this place!  Fantatstic food and service that always delivers!!!  We left with about 10 complimentary cinnamon sugar mini donuts they make fresh and hot right there.

Killer deals at Bobby Q's happy hour (3-6) too for their beef brisket tacos!

Go, you simply will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing every time we go.  Ribs are flavored just right and they are fall off the bone, just like they claim.  Cornbread is just right --- just a little sweet.  And the sides are just as good.  I always get the mashed potatoes or Mac n' Cheese.  Yummyness.  What I appreciate the most is that the food comes out hot every time and the waitstaff are always very friendly."}
{"text":"Beyond impressed! We've wanted to try Bobby Q's for years, ever since we saw it reviewed and featured on Check, Please! Arizona (local PBS station show where Arizonians share and review each other's favorite restaurants). We were in Glendale For Glendale Glitters, and as I always do, I searched Yelp for restaurant options nearby with a lot of reviews, and high reviews. Bobby Q's was just 5 miles away in Phoenix, so the stars finally aligned! 

The restaurant was busy, as expected on a Saturday night, so we opted to try the outdoor seating in lieu of the 20-minute wait for an indoor table. The hostess assured us that it should be comfortable when she saw our hesitation, that there were plenty of heaters to keep us warm (hey, 45 degrees in AZ is cold!), and it was perfect. 

Victoria, our server, was welcoming and helpful, my mom, husband and I ordered our drinks and meals, the sangria was good, as was the corn bread. We ordered the Q Rolls, and it took longer than expected to recieve them; however, they were delivered with an apology for the tardiness, an explanation that our ticket went missing (they were crazy busy), and we were told they were on the house for the delay. We all looked at each other and said wow, great service! By the way, I will dream about those Q rolls, wrapped in crispy spring roll-like shells was the best, and most tender, beef brisket I've ever tasted -- the juices ran down my hand while eating. 

We found ourselves ordering drink refills, and people watching while we fell into a conversation lull, before we realized it'd been a while since we had finished our appetizer. The food was delayed due to previous ticket issue, but was so incredibly good. My mom and I each ordered the stuffed potatoes with pork, mine with veggies on the side, which I was impressed were cooked kabob style on a grill (too many restaurants treat vegetable sides as a boring after thought), we also ordered a side of sautéed mushroom and onions that I nearly wanted to swim in because they were so flavorful! The ribs my husband ordered were tender, and their spicy barbecue sauce was a great pairing. He said the Mac and cheese was \"so good,\" as was the roasted corn he ordered, and the pecan coleslaw my mom ordered. Our eyes all lit up with the first bite, and I said, \"we're definitely finding reasons to come back here\" (we live an hour away). 

Donny, the manager stopped by and apologized for the delay, and offered to buy us desert. We are so impressed by the level of customer service we just received! Not enough businesses take care of their customers like this anymore. The food was so good that we would have gone back regardless, but the positive, and proactive, customer service we received drive me to write this review, and want to tell my friends and family about this place. 

I've tried and cooked a lot of barbecue, we have a Texas sized semi-professional smoker at home, my family is Southern, and I grew up on North Carolina barbecue, this is THE FIRST time I've ever eaten barbecue outside of NC (most certainly in AZ) that I can rave about, and that I will make a point to seek out again. 

My only disappointment was the Q-Lina sauce -- I understand barbecue is regional, and as personal and touchy as religion and politics to some, but the traditional NC barbecue I grew up with didn't involve tomato/ketchup/sugar based sauces. This is in no way a deal breaker, as I loved their traditional and spicy barbecue sauces for the sweet tomato concoctions they were, and will stick to those in future visits. 

Thanks to Donny and Victoria for taking care of us as first timers, so glad we have left overs to look forward to, and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Great service.. Great atmosphere.. Amazing BBQ.. Probably one of the best! It's kind of a hidden treasure.. Don't let the street view fool you, as soon as you walk in, you'll find everything to be clean and the food fresh! GREAT place!"}
{"text":"I came here a few nights ago with a group of about 10 others. The staff was very welcoming and either the owner/manager was there greeting everyone who came into the door. 
They did mistakenly bring out an incorrect order for someone that I was with, but the owner/manager personally came over and took the plate back and brought the correct order, on the house. EXCELLENT customer service. 
The food itself also warrants 5 stars. The meat was really tender and flavorful and the sauce was great. I'll definitely be back to try out other items."}
{"text":"First off , I've tried bbq from North Carloina,  to Texas,  but nothing compares to bobby qs.  Their cornbread is OUT OF THIS WORLD . The pulled pork A+, the mac n cheese is creamy heaven , and the staff is ALWAYS polite and friendly . Never have my girlfriend or I ever had a disappointing experience here! A MUST TRY in phoenix . Plus you get free mini donuts at the end of every meal :)"}
{"text":"BBQ yummy!!! I'm from San Diego and I've been to Phil's BBQ and they pretty much go toe to toe. 

I feel like I should've ordered something else cause my chicken sandwich was alright, but everyone else's food was awesome. I tried my table mates food and the meat just fell off the ribs. It was delicious! They also have a spicy BBQ sauce upon request. I'm telling you to request it! Its tasty!

I love that they gave complimentary cornbread during and donuts at the end of your meal. Didn't need to order dessert!

All in all, good experience."}
{"text":"Love their food!

I have been 3 times now. The first 2 times I had great service. This last time I was here for my birthday dinner with a friend. Our service was weird, it was multiple people but no one around when we actually needed anything. Our food took a very long time too. The table who sat next to us were seated and got their food before we received our 2 orders. Although it took what felt like forever for our food it was great like I expected.

By the time we were able to leave it took quite some time to get our bill, pay and even ask for a box all while servers were rushing around past us to help other people but no one to really help us. Once we were finally leaving I realized that we had waited so long that 3 couples had already been seated, eaten, paid and left at the same table next to us all in the time it took us to order an appetizer and a meal for 2. 

If it wasn't for the great food I may have given less stars. I most likely will be back, but to the new location in Mesa. Driving 30 miles for dinner to wait that long is not ideal."}
{"text":"I love the ambience of this place, there's always something to look at. The barbecue is amazing as well as the macaroni and cheese. I have had many items on this menu but always come back for the brisket. The brisket is very tender and has a great smoky flavor. It goes well with either the loaded mashed potatoes, loaded baked potato, or and in my opinion the best cheesiest homemade macaroni and cheese I have ever had.I would definitely recommend to anyone and will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Corn bread was super awesome!! It came out warm and soft and amazing. The waiter recommended the two meat option; wasn't sure what he chose for me but they were amazing! The meat were cooked well, fell of the bone style and were super succulent! MUST try the pecan coleslaw! Loved the combination! 

Also, on another note, there is a Poké gym within the building. Battling while stuffing yourself with meat = fantastic. (P.s. Bunch of eevees too!)"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped at Bobby Q's because we were in that area of town and looking for something tasty for lunch on Yelp. We found this place, which had several stellar reviews, and decided to give it a try. 

I got the beef brisket sandwich and my wife got the pulled pork sandwich. I had a side of fries and she got a side of macaroni and cheese. Starting with mine, the beef brisket was amazing. It was well seasoned, they used incredibly soft, super fresh, potato rolls for the buns, and the order came out hot. The french fries were crisp and well seasoned. 

The pulled pork that my wife had was good as well, however it was a little on the dry side, and probably could have used some more barbeque sauce. The macaroni and cheese was really good, and some of the creamiest I've ever had. As a starter, they also bring out cornbread which is hot, fresh and soft. It was quite excellent. 

For drinks we both got some of their specials. The drinks were massive, well priced at only $10 apiece, and easily big enough to share! Our waiter was Mateo, and he was really friendly and helpful. If he's working, request him. The restaurant itself had a huge outdoor covered seating area with fans and a fountain. There was a nice breeze, and even though it was a hot day it was still comfortable to sit outside. We really enjoyed this place, and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I just feel compelled to again state how much I freakin' love this place

I think its super.

Last time I branched out and ordered a filet (my bf ordered ribs and then we split to make for a delicious mixed meal)

OMG
THE FILET WAS AMAZING!

Like, better than high end steakhouses.
I love this place.

Just wish it were closer to me!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Food, service, atmosphere...everything was great! Big portions, Mac n cheese was great! St. Louis Ribs were extra meaty, brisket tender, catfish crispy, and beef ribs were super tender!! And they serve Sweet Tea! Lemonade comes in a frosted mug either on the rocks or slushy. We had on the rocks and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Such a fun atmosphere! There's so much to look at.
The food is great, wasn't too impressed with the macaroni, tasted like velveeta to me, but the rest of the food was on point! I'd try em out if you've never been there."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentines dinner, it was fairly easy to get in (even though they asked if we had reservations) there was no wait time. The hostess was very nice (Paloma) and quick with getting us situated and fed. The food was good, not what I expected for the price though. 
   Both mine and my boyfriends meals were a bit on the bland side not having much flavor. We had to put salt and pepper on everything, the Mac n cheese tasted like the Velveeta box kind and the \"grilled veggies\" were not grilled and were just blah, however their cornbread was DELISH! and melted in your mouth! Sooooo good! Now the catfish and ribs my boyfriend ordered were VERY TASTY and the ribs literally fell off the bone! But the steak I ordered was just ok, I had a better one at Red Lobster?!
  If we get food from here again I'll probably just stick to the ribs next time."}
{"text":"The ribs are really good. Jessica was our server and she was very helpful and attentive. Mac and cheese alone is worth going back for. The donuts at the end are melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"First visit here as I was looking for a decent BBQ experience.   I have to say this was far better than entry level decent!   The food exceeded my expectations as did the wonderful service provided by Leigh Ann (sp) I highly recommended \"The Whole Hog\", a varietal feast for two!  The baby back ribs melted off the bone!  Mac & Cheese tasty as was the seasoned roasted corn. This place is worthy of future visits with more friends in tow!"}
{"text":"Denise and I met our daughter and her boyfriend for dinner yesterday on my birthday. Always wanted to try this place. We started off with the Q-rolls, guess this is suppose to be trendy! Many restaurants are doing the same thing. hybrid of a egg roll and sandwich! This one was BBQ brisket deep fried like an egg roll! It was OK, not that bad. I ended up ordering their combo platter, sample of their ribs, sausage, and brisket ts. Sausage was great and spicy, and their ribs were very good. Wife had the fried chicken (boneless) I am not a fan of boneless chicken. No flavor! Get me a fried chick with bone, it will taste a lot better then bone out! So! Their chicken really had no flavor, wife was not impressed. Daughter had a burger that was huge, and it looked great! Wanted to try it, but I had enough on my plate already. Wife had a bite and said it was really good. We ended up have their peach cobbler, I tried a little. Not a big fan of peach, plus daughter already baked me a cake for my birthday. Wife again was not impressed by, said it was to doughy! 
Biggest Con! Price! I have had better BBQ that cost a lot less. Spending $100.00 for four I expected it to be a little better. 
Loved the place, would like to come back on a weekend evening to see how the atmosphere is!"}
{"text":"Honestly not the best bbq I've had famous Dave's best ribs and Rudy's best brisket. I really liked the spinach and artichoke. The food was just way to greasy and fatty for my likings"}
{"text":"Went to this establishment to celebrate my graduation. The food was amazing. We made reservations, so we didn't have to wait in line. The food came out quick.

I'm from CA, but if I come back to AZ for any reason, I would eat here because of Destiny. Her service exceeded my expectations tremendously and made my celebration very special."}
{"text":"I went to this place with some friends, and with an open mind. The service was great! Unfortunately, the food was so-so. I ordered the pulled pork and received a rather dry pile of shredded pork topped with a dollop of barbecue sauce. The vegetables on the side had this intense, artificial \"liquid smoke\" smell that was so strong I almost could not eat them. The other side dish I ordered was the mac-and-cheese, which tasted of the Kraft variety. The menu said it had three cheeses in it, mine had a chunk of unmelted cheddar in the middle that was not very appetizing.

The other people I was eating with liked their food. One ordered baby back ribs and the other had some kind of a roast. Typical overpriced American fare."}
{"text":"A gem in the Phoenix area for good smoked BBQ. My favorite is the Sunday's Whole Hog combo to share with three. The smoked prime rib here is also a treat. I love the corn bread while you wait!"}
{"text":"I came here because it was on Yelp's 100 reviewed restaurants in USA. I feel this place does not deserve the hype it receives and the food comes off as glorified food truck distributor food. 

I was pretty hungry being on the plane all day, so I figured I would order a ton of food. For starters, I ordered the Q Rolls and Cajun Shrimp. Of course I had to try their cornbread they give out for free. I went with two orders of the three meat combo which includes pulled pork, brisket, ribs, sausage, and chicken.
The Q Rolls are definitely the few highlights of the meal. They were meaty, greasy, and a satisfying crunch on the outside. The queso dip that comes with it makes it even better. The cajun shrimp were Ok, but Im a dummy thinking arizona is going to have good shrimp. The cornbread was really moist. I was only going to have one bite, but ended up having half of the entire piece. Now for the meats. Dont get me wrong as I highly critisize the meal. This is much better than Rudy's or Dickey's (gross). But I was expecting something on the same line as Lockhart, TX (which I foolishly continue to expect when going to so claimed 'amazing' barbecue joints.) THe ribs were fall of the bone (not my favorite style, although some people like that). The pulled pork was soggy. The brisket had some good points, but the bark was soggy (they probably use foil to speed up the cooking process). The sausage was OK, but nothing special. It certainly could have been spicier. The chicken totally took me by surprise. It was moist, tender, and had a nice smoke to it. Normally I wouldnt order chicken over the usual trinity, but they do a good job. All the meats had this sweet taste to it, and didnt have much of a strong smoke flavor (besides the chicken). The BBQ sauce on the table just added to the sweetness. 

The sides were all crap, expect the mac and cheese. That was actually pretty good. Everything else lacks any real flavor or craft. For dessert, they gave us some in house donuts. I like the idea of this, but they are arent that spectacular. My friend wanted coffee, even after the waiter said it as horrible. It was probably the most watery coffee Id ever tasted. I know coffee is not something someone should order at a BBQ joint, but at least you know ahead of time.

I imagine people who think this place is amazing either eat bbq from dickeys or have never visited Texas. Either way, I wouldnt come back here again on my own time and would advise anyone you can to go to Little Miss BBQ instead. Thats how BBQ should be."}
{"text":"For me, best barbecue around. Next closest is Franklin's in of Austin Texas. They work hard on the quality and it is always very tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Best BBQ in AZ I promise you. Meat cooked perfect, sides were great, big portions. I didn't try the dessert because I was so full but it looked yummy.  Staff was super nice as well. A++"}
{"text":"It was my Bachelors of Science in Project Management graduation gift from my fiancé, Tony.  I love a great steak, since I was raised in a Slaughting Ranch in Mexico with my Grandparents.   I know a great steak.  Paloma was our wonderful waitress, very knowledgeable about the the manner in which they age the beef, when they cut the steaks, and with what they grill it.  When the steak arrived it was accompanied by grilled vegetables, and a loaded baked potato, which the exterior had been rolled in seasalt while baking.  The steak was grilled perfectly, mouth watering tender piece of heaven.  I would be remiss if I do not mention the rolls of tender Brisket snuggled in a deep fried flour tortilla, it had a wonderful taste of Carne Machaca, so tasty.  We completed the scrupulous dinner with a very light dessert of a pineapple drink.  The drink arrived in a beautiful hollowed out pineapple.  The drink was so refreshing and yet not too sweet.  Donny, the Manager was so hospitable, made us feel like family, or regulars.  We will return.  I would highly recommend making a reservation.  Thank you for a memorable graduation gift.  Delia,"}
{"text":"Some of the best pulled pork I have had in life, let alone in the Phoenix valley. My waiter- Kody was fantastic and and the meat was the perfect amount of smokey sweetness! I highly recommend this to anyone who is a BBQ fan. Side note- they gave us freshly made mini donuts as we left- I mean- come on!"}
{"text":"Ribs, perfect, chicken moist, ribeye tender... great poor, yummy corn muffins.. we took some home. Hot doughnuts for dessert. Yes they are busy.. I can see why."}
{"text":"I just drove past Bobby-Q's and remembered that I've had a good experience with them.

The time was around Thanksgiving. They offer smoked turkeys that are pretty much ingenious. One, they're smoked - so literally half the cooking is done for you. I can't stand putting an entire raw bird in an oven and waiting for it to cook for 234 hours. Well, I've never really done that, because I think I wouldn't like it much, as I hate waiting while I watch people poke, prod, and baste a raw behemoth and then put it in the oven for 234 hours. 

This thing was done in I think 2 hours. 2 hours!!! Brilliant. And better yet - it tasted phenomenal. The spice rub was so complementary to the meat it needed no sauce to make it a tasty experience. 

And it wasn't cost-prohibitive. The only thing you really need to worry about is ordering one well enough ahead of time for your occasion."}
{"text":"Awesome spot and very good BBQ! The brisket is tender and cooked perfect, the portion is great! Also the rotisserie chicken is vey good! Service is superb!! Our waiter Jay was extraordinary! Went out of his way to make our night special.. Stay for the club later it reminds me of the LA club scenes in the 90's! Jesse is the best!! Fantastic night!"}
{"text":"Jack was an excellent server. Being that we were first-timers at Bobby-Qs, he was very thorough and was very attentive. I had the filet, while the rest of the family had brisket and pulled pork. One word to describe ... DELICIOUS!  And the hot cinnamon sugar donuts when we got our bill topped off our great meal. Will be back again!  Be sure to check-in on Yelp to get a discount on your bill at check out too!"}
{"text":"Like most people who grew up here I have driven by this place a thousand time, and gone in a few. Bobby Q's has always been known for its bar. The night life, has always been it calling card; now that has changed. 

Last night I took my wife there for an anniversary dinner we started off with a few drinks. Bar staff were friendly and attentive. My wife had the Chocolate martini, that's a desert before dinner.  We had reservations at 7:30, and we were seated at 7:32. The place was packed, so when you go, get a reservation. We started with Cajun shrimp, good serving, and it was a short wait for the appetizer. Good quality corn bread was brought out with our appetizer. We really wanted to try the prime rib. I researched, and found that Bobby Q's has been voted the best, and they are right. Prime rib was tender, and you almost don't need a knife. The flavor was outstanding. I like a lot of people like horseradish, and they have the creamy type, and fresh ground, and it is fresh. When you bit in, and feel the heat in your nostrils.. That is fresh. The other side were as good, and the pecan coleslaw was outstanding! One person I talked to about Bobby Q's said it was a bit pricey, but the quantity and quality of food you get is worth it. Our server (I wish I remembered her name) was great. She was there when you want her, and not when you don't. Desert was apple cobbler, tart apples, crunchy crusts, and good vanilla ice cream; Granny would be proud. 
The only one thing that was not to my taste, and this is not the fault of the restaurant is the noise.. A lot of people drinking, eating, and talk tends to do that, but the swap of that food for a little noise, it's worth it..

If you haven't tried this place yet, you're missing it. All you people like me who remember Bobby \"s for the bar scene; well its different now."}
{"text":"I was traveling with my husband and after flight we decided to eat in Bobby Q.  We have some good restaurants back in Chicago and we enjoy many of them but I have to tell you that we did not expect this restaurant to have such a good food.  
We had full size fire roasted baby back ribs, roasted vegetables, baked potato and house salad.  Those ribs were so soft and BBQ sauce was amazing!!!
Even vegetables had a scent of the real fire and had a perfect tenderness. Our fully loaded potato was exquisite.  Just a perfect taste.  Salad- was a house salad. Good tasting but Nothing special about it.  
If they had mixed greens or spinach- It would be my favorite place.  Nevertheless I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone. 
Andrew and Elwira"}
{"text":"Definitely a great dinner spot to hit up if you're visiting Phoenix. As all the reviews said -- food was amazing and service was excellent! For a group of 7 we got Hog Heaven, extra order of fries and Saint Louis Ribs. Loved the complimentary corn bread and donuts! They kept your drinks refilled and best thing is after you order the food is served shortly after you devour the delicious corn bread. Their sangria and ale were also worth trying :)"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Phoenix.  The ribs, the pulled pork, brisket, it's all awesome.  BUT........ the mac & cheese........... it's addictive!  The best I have ever had anywhere EVER!!  My husband tried to steal a bite once & he nearly lost a digit!  The \"Thank Q's\" at the end of your meal are a cute touch.
  They do have a full bar in the restaurant, as well as a lounge.
If you love BBQ, or even like it just a little bit......... you have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place today. Stopped in with a friend for a late lunch. Our waiter Jonah was beyond amazing. He recommended the corn bread to start then gave us suggestions for other appetizers. Q rolls were delicious along with the wings and chicken tenders. The manager Taylor went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. When we were finished they brought us sugar doughnuts that were the best. We sat outside on the patio that was spacious and held a lot of charm. I will definitely be back to visit with friends."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq, tried the \"smoasted\" (smoke-roasted) chicken and the brisket, both excellent. Sauces good but not needed with the amount of flavor meat had. Sides excellent-roasted corn especially, table cornbread and donuts delicious as well."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I ever had. The corn bread is outstanding plus there spicy bbq sauce is crazy good. Great service and cocktails. They have a secret Bourbon Mule Delicious"}
{"text":"Outstanding ribs and great atmosphere.  My new favorite BBQ"}
{"text":"Wow! what a buried treasure that I have heard so much about, and today we found it!!
Have seen the sign, but never knew where they were...but oh do we now! We went there today for lunch, and it was a treat from the moment you walked into the place. The hostesses greeted us, sat us immediately, and then \"Christopher\" appeared like magic as our server! What a delight, he was funny, great suggesting things, and very professional! I had the beef brisket sandwich with those crazy fries, my hubby had the pulled pork with a delicious pecan cole slaw...yummy! Our friends had the brisket also, and we were delighted with everything, we will be back and we will ask for Christopher! Thanks for the \"donuts\"... :-) jojo"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! Fall off the bone ribs, tender Tri Tip! The Mac and cheese was so creamy and tasty!! The service was great I forgot the servers name but he was great! Even the manager of the night was going around to the tables to check on us. We sat on the outside patio that was decorated beautifully! The lights, the table to the water fountain and the nice view of the bar and televisions! Great pric"}
{"text":"Nice dinner spot. Bartenders were super friendly and informative. Started out with a happy hour Bobby Mule. Twist on a Moscow mule with some tequila and honey. No fear, honey is subtle. Drink was well mixed and presentation was excellent. For dinner I had the two meat combo. Baby back ribs were great, flavorful, fell off the bone and not too sloppy. Brisket was okay, texture was solid but just an underwhelming sauce. Cornbread was unique and again, great presentation. Portion sizes were very large. Best part of the meal were the side dishes. The Mac and cheese had some great flavor with even better consistency (no runny cheese) and the mashed potatoes were extremely fresh. After the meal be sure to take home some fresh donut holes for free. They taste like mini elephant ear rounds. Average to above average BBQ, but a great atmosphere with tasty complimentary side dishes."}
{"text":"Really impressed with the service and quality of the food here. Overall, the best BBQ I've had to date. Highly recommended. Be sure to make reservations!"}
{"text":"Awesome food  hostess and waitress were excellent. Homely but classy building and decorations. We ordered a mixed family platter with St Louis ribs/baby back/ brisket and sausage, all were excellent and tasty. Highly recommend this bbq joint. When I come back to Phoenix I will surely come back again"}
{"text":"Travelling from California I found this place on google. I have to say it is in my top 5 of best bbq I have ever ate."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting and looking for a BBQ place and ended up at Bobby Q's. Let me start off by saying I'm not a huge fan of bbq so I was hesitant on going, but once I tasted it I was SO glad we chose it! The portions are huge and easily shareable, plus the sides are SO good! I tried the macaroni and mashed potatoes and they were both great along with the corn bread which comes before your meal. They also give you mini doughnuts with your check which were again super good. The service was also great, I don't remember our server's name but he was super attentive and recommended a bunch of items on the menu. Bobby Q's is definitely worth checking out and it's safe to say I will be eating there whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"If you've never been to bobby q you have got to go! One of the best meals I've ever had! Mashpotatoes to die for & try the q rolls beef brisket in a tauqito type breading with a chipotle dipping sauce?? Yes please!!"}
{"text":"Anyone that doesn't give this place at least 4 stars probably thinks Burger King is real food. 

 This place has consistently provided the wife and I with amazing food for over 10 years."}
{"text":"A mandatory stop on every Spring Training trip.
All 3 of us get the 3 meat comb,  never have been disappointed.   Will be back next year if not sooner."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a comfortable but classy kind of country charm.  There was a nice size bar area and people seemed to be having a good time watching the game on the two large flatscreen televisions.  The regular dining area was a large room with several smaller areas off of the large area.  There was a mixture of square, rectangular and round wooden tables and chairs.  While we were there I saw the staff moving some tables together to create dining for a large group of people.  The lighting was low, more like a bar setting, but adequate.  We had reservations, via Open Table & the Yelp app, and were seated immediately.  

Our server was friendly and attentive.  We ordered two Strawberry Q'ladas, a strawberry flavored Pina Colada, off the speciality drink menu.  We got our drinks then he took our order and food was at our table about 15 minutes later.  The drinks were very good, but we both wished they packed more booze.  The cornbread was brought to our table after our drinks but before our meal.  Both grandkids had to have some right away.  Both gobbled down their pieces and probably would have asked for more if they could have gotten away with it.  

The Baby Back Ribs were outstanding; falling off the bone the way they are supposed to be but hard to get just anywhere these days.  I also had the Pecan Cole Slaw and fortunately for me, the pecans were sprinkled on top so I could scoop them off and eat the rest of the really good slaw.  The Ranch Beans were pretty unusual.  I have not tasted anything quite like them.  My wife said they had cinnamon in them but there were a bit too spicy for me so I shoved them off on my grandson, the \"fire eating kid.\"  But I enjoyed what I had already eaten.  The cornbread was good but I really liked the super thin french fries I kept stealing off my granddaughter's kid burger meal plate.

My wife had the 8 oz Sirloin Steak and Baked Potato.  She asked that the steak be medium well and it was.  It appeared to be larger than 8 oz.  The potato wasn't as good as the steak; it could have been a little hotter.  It also came with a few thin onion straws that were a nice little surprise.  Before we left, we were surprised with some warm little donuts to take with us.  They were rolled in cinnamon and sugar and were just the right end to a delicious meal.

I asked the server if there was any chance the owners would open a location in Tucson because we would definitely be regulars.  But sadly, according to our server, both the owner and his kids are retirement age and the likelihood of a Tucson location appears to be extremely slim."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, ambience and service. Ordered the 2 item beef ribs and brisket, mashed potatoes & roasted veggies. Made to perfection!"}
{"text":"i still have dreams about this place. deliciously evil, fair priced BBQ. A must have if you're in town."}
{"text":"I went there today with my family because of all the reviews on yelp. When we got there our waitress was nice and it was a busy place. The food was off the chain. It was the best ribs I ever had in Arizona so far. Please try out this place and it will be worth it. Great food, wonderful service, fair price."}
{"text":"In town for spring training with my dad and uncle. A+ BEST RESTAURANT in Phoenix ! And we tried most of them! We stayed at the inn place motel and it's only a mile down the road. Friendly staff Vanessa   Was our waitress and she was so nice and helpful. Struck up conversation and actually made us feel right at home! 
They have a full bar and lounge for night life but we dined in I got the brisket platter (smoked for 18hrs ) and it was delicious!!!! So juicy and flavorful, came with 2 sides I got creamy mashed potatoes and shoe string fries both tasted hot n fresh not frozen or microwaved like most restaurants potato products. During our (short) wait after ordering we were served fresh made from scratch corn bread and got another basket without having to ask. A few rounds of beers/drinks and we were stuffed and completely happy. 


UPDATE: We went back! Our last night and this was the only place we wanted to be at. Our server was  Sarah  And she was friendly fast and had refills out without asking I got the same order (plain and simple) and if possible it was BETTER than the first time! 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO SPRING TRAINING CROWD 

No wait weeknights 
About $20 out the door meat entree 2 sides drink tip tax 
Free refills

Last night had another great experience with Amberlie as our waitress! She was outstanding. I also discovered a new yummy drink there: their sangria! Will have that again next time for sure! I always take out-of-town guests here and it never disappoints."}

Then came the cornbread  -  that's when perfection got started.  I ordered the three meet dinner with brisket, sausage and baby back ribs.   Damn so tasty all falling of the bone so tender.   Two sauces mild and hot.  My glass never empty.    Manager came by after to check on us-- she was just  awesome.   Ordered a dozen cornbread to take home.   Then they bring us a little bag of hot cinnamon and sugar donuts  -- perfect surprise.  These guys know BBQ.  Definitely best overall in Phoenix!!   Do it!!"}

Had the Q-rolls, smoked prime rib, and half chicken. Plus some drinks...all for $80 including tax/tips!

Perfectly cooked. Juicy, tender meat. What more can you ask for?

Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Happy hour 50% off and cold beer, near the hotel. The chicken wings and brisket rolls are excellent"}
{"text":"I thought, silly name, can't be serious barbecue, but this is good!

Meats are slow smoked, and arrive hot, smoky and juicy with a choice of sides and hot or mild sauce.  For a starter we had some Q-rolls, kind of a BBQ brisket taquito, with chipotle sauce.  Good start.  Beef ribs and pork ribs were tender and easily pulled off the bone.  Brisket and pulled pork were as tender as could be, with a nice pink smoke ring, evidence of slow smoking.  Excellent Mac and cheese and pecan cole slaw.  Beer is plentiful and cold, service quick and attentive, and (bonus) a check in discount for Yelpers when we visited.  This is now on my list for future visits to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Reasonable prices for the portion size. We was too stuffed for desserts. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"New to the area and found this place always looks busy when driving by on the freeway so looked it up on yelp and saw it was worthy for a try.  Well....in a word...\"underwhelmed\".  Should probably be one star.  It was extremely busy for a Sunday evening which I guess is a good sign and they seated me right away (party of one) so thumbs up there.  I ordered the wedge salad to start and what I got was a very cheap iceberg lettuce head with a sliced tomato and some cold greasy onion straws on the side.  See what I mean?  The menu made it sound like it was a specialty of the house!  Their \"homemade blue cheese dressing\" was more mayo than anything...couldn't taste any blue cheese in there.  Seriously, worse than a chain restaurant and a few dollars more expensive too.  The St. Louis ribs were an item that is particularly reviewed on yelp so I went for those with a baked potato and macaroni and cheese.  Taste was good, not spectacular but the real problem was the temperature...pretty close to room temp.  I knew I had been had by all the advertising for this place...more hype than substance.  The waitress asked how everything was and I started to say it was just ok and elaborate the problems but she quickly whisked away to another table.  I could tell she was working to the max so I let it slide.  Overall, a thumbs down.  There are a few other BBQ places in Phoenix so I'll look there next."}
{"text":"If you've never been to bobby q's you have to try their baby back ribs. They are the best fall off the bone baby back ribs I've ever had!!! The cornbread and donuts are to die for."}
{"text":"Love that BBQ

Had an excellent meal at Bobby Q's, ordered the platter with pulled chicken, brisket and ribs. The  chicken and brisket were moist, tender, and flavorful and the ribs were fall of the bone delicious.

The service is great and the staff is helpful and accomdating."}
{"text":"Travis was our server and we had a large group. He did and excellent job with all the orders and keeping up with our needs. The food was excellent; I had the smokehouse burger and it was delicious. If ever in Phoenix again we'll definitely be back. Everyone enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Fall of the bone juicy, tender, well seasoned, and nice waitress at our table,  pretty much summed up or night. 

Ordered hog heaven, thinking it would be sufficient for 2 people - - easily could've fed 4. The meat separated from the bone so well that we skipped the knives. We might even have skipped the fork too because it was quite delicious. The most memorable part was the corn bread. I normally hate corn bread because it's like rolled up dust balls sprinkle with corn essence. Not the ones here. This page turned me into a believer of corn bread and the Arizona charm. 

Baby back, St Louis, pulled pork and chicken ranked from favourite to least favorite. Chicken was bland and feels similar to what I would get at Costco. Pulled pork was soft and moist, but the essence came from the BBQ sauce. The ribs though. You can't go wrong with the ribs."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ in the valley. Their brisket is always delicious, as is the corn bread and the mac n cheese. (Let's be honest, there's not a bad item on the entire menu). If you go and you don't order the Q Rolls, you are doing yourself a disservice. They are amazing! The wait can be long, but it's worth it. Plan ahead and make a reservation if you have a large group. Going in as a party of 2, we've never waited very long."}
{"text":"I love coming here and I have been for years so why not write a review ....every time we visit we are always pleasantly greeted. Our food is fresh and cooked great. I'm a picky BBQ eater and I've never had a bad dish here and of course the corn bread and fresh donuts are an added bonus!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  I heard it was good but the brisket was very fatty.  We had a reservation and still had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  Don't think I will hurry back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places to enjoy a casual dinner, especially in the evening. Love the vibe and atmosphere that this place casts. The servers are always attentive and friendly. Also, each time I've gone a manager will swing by the table to make sure everything is great. I would also recommend stopping by for their happy hour specials. Lastly, get the Q-Rolls, you won't regret them!"}
{"text":"Sorry, I gotta write the review before I decide on the stars.  I've been wanting to go to Bobby's for a long time.  Finally made it for dinner last week.  We had a reservation - and I'd sure recommend it for dinner - and were seated right on time.  Think we were in the main room, back by the take-out room.  A little noisy.  Very good waitress.  Cornbread was amazing....next time that's all I'm going to order. 

Ok, down to deciding.  I guess my main complaint was that nothing tasted particularly smoked.  The brisket was good, but if it was smoked as long as they claim, there should have been more smoke - there was just a narrow, light ring.
The sides were excellent.  The wine was good, the people were very friendly.

I will go again...want to try it for lunch.  So I've decided.  Next time I really hope it's a 4 or 5."}
{"text":"One of our favorite stops in phoenix. Our company has a datacenter in phoenix so every few months we head down to phoenix and make it a point of going to bobby Qs. I typically get their prime rib which is always cooked to a perfect mid rare as requested. Their service is always excellent. We must keep going during their training cycle because they always have us sit where the waiter is training someone. Their pricing is perfect for the amount and quality of thr food. I will be back."}
{"text":"Love the food. Always fantastic. Service is hit n miss. Met my hubby here 18 years ago, when it was Bobby McGee's so it has a special place in our hearts. Bobby Q's should follow the Ray Kroc motto- put your money on the talent(service)."}
{"text":"I've been a Yelp lurker for a long time... Taking advice from others without actually posting my own reviews of restaurants.

I decided to break my silence after I had lunch at Bobby Qs.  Visiting from out of town, we decided to get BBQ before heading to the airport.  Everything- from the food to the atmosphere to the service was delicious.

Although the pulled pork sandwich was delicious, the real star of the show was the Q-Rolls appetizer.  

Now... Would it be wrong to reschedule a flight in order to fit in one more meal at Bobby-Qs?!"}
{"text":"I'm in the service industry and am pretty critical on service but this place not only had great food but the service to match. I normally just write a review and move on but it was so good I actually went searching for bad reviews because it's simply mind boggling anyone could write something negative. First timer but I'll be back! Thanks Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"My family is new to the Phoenix area and I asked around to see where I should find good BBQ and Bobby Q is where I was lead. The brisket was very tender and moist and the Mac n cheese is heavenly :) You definitely get what you pay for and our waitress Nicole was a sweetheart and took very good care of us, as did the rest of the staff who checked on us periodically asking how everything was. Very friendly setting and very delicious food!!! P.s. you get a little dessert surprise on the way out :) that was my favorite part"}
{"text":"Once again I don't understand these high reviews they must have not ate at the same restaurant that I ate at. Everything I ate was extremely greasy/ fattening and artificial tasting. The free corn bread they bring out was so buttery and greasy I couldn't eat it. Next my girlfriend and I shared two entrees, the pork ribs with mac n cheese and fries, and the pulled pork with corn and cole slaw. The ribs were so fatty and the quality of meat was not up to par. The pulled pork had a nice flavor but made me feel very ill once I was done. The corn was a joke, it was super water logged and they left the unwanted part of the corn on top as a garnish."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch here last week and loved it!  The atmosphere is cool and the food was delicious.  Some of the best BBQ we have had.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and macaroni and cheese.  He had the ribs.  Both were awesome.  Service was great.  We would highly recommend it! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm actually writing this review while sitting in the restaurant because I'm so full and my pig of a husband is still eating :)

The food is great here. The whole hog heaven combo is more than enough for two people. I also really like the baked potato! I wish the roasted vegetables were a little warmer.

The service here is excellent. From the moment of entering, to waiting for food and everything, service was excellent. I had four different people either checked up on us or brought us extra condiments/forks.

I'm glad this is our last meal in Phoenix on this vacation."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ you will ever find in Phoenix, Arizona. Nice portions, great atmosphere, very nice patio and superb waitstaff make this the place to go for slow-smoked BBQ. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I went there last night for Happy Hour (which is available in their lounge section). Let me say the food was WOW. I kept hearing about this place's food and finally decided to go try it myself. My boyfriend and I were surprised how dead the lounge was, as we both have been there on Friday and Saturday nights and the place is packed. Anyway, they offer 1/2 price appetizers from 4-8 Tuesday-Friday. We ordered their Jumbo Wings, asked if they come with a medium sauce, waitress said no. So I asked for sauce on the side, as I don't like very spicy food. Also ordered a brisket quesadilla and beer fries. The wings were very big, all drumsticks. Perfectly fried, very meaty, and their wing sauce is not too spicy, it was delicious. Perfect wing sauce I say, not too thick or thin, full of flavor, with a little kick. Excellent. The brisket quesadilla was huge, very meaty, and the meat inside was perfectly tender. The beer fries, oh the fries! The waitress told me about them, they are not on the menu, you have to ask for them. They were the best I've ever had. For fries, you don't expect much. They're fries for God's sake, but these fries are something to talk about. Crisp, flavorful, salty with a little sweet. Definitely a must try! I'm excited to actually go eat in the restaurant section next time! DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great BBQ place! Would definitely recommend the Brisket, pulled pork and Mac n cheese. The service was great as well, Kodi had no problem handling a table of eight. Plus they give you complimentary mini donuts at the end :)"}
{"text":"We try to make it for at least one meal each time we visit Arizona. This time, it was on St. Patties day, for a larger party, also celebrating a birthday. We didnt have to wait long at all for them to get our table ready. The server also had alot of fun making sure we were able to have \"green beers\" we were hopeing to celebrate with. The Sunday BBQ special with all the diffrent cuts of meat, enough for at least 2 (if not more) to share was great, and plenty to go around, at an extremely reasonable price. Everyone was full, and very happy. Like always, good food at the right price. The fresh, made in house donut holes to top off the meal are always looked forward to, and will return everytime we visit."}
{"text":"Went Sunday night with the bf, and we shared a huge combo of prime rib and bbq chicken with baked potato and 2 sides. We opted for a 2nd baked potato and pecan cole slaw.
We ordered hot tea, and it's the cute little boxes of Revolution tea, in various flavors -golden chamomile, ginger peach, tropical green, and earl grey lavender is what we ended up with. Love all of them.
I love prime rib, and this really hit the spot. The horseradish was not that spicy though. Still tasty (we get both) but I was hoping it had more of a kick. 
The bbq chicken practically fell right off the bone. the bbq sauce is one of my favorites.
Cole slaw was delicious as usual, but I didn't see any pecans.

Stefania was our server, and she was pleasant and attentive.


I like how versatile the table and booths are. They can easily be arranged to accommodate various sized groups, and just the fact that you can control how close you are to the table is always a plus in my book. I've been to other restaurants where it feels like you're a mile away from the table if you want back support. So it's great that this is not an issue.

I really want to try their oatmeal cookie martini, and some of the desserts were tempting, but I don't know if I'll ever have room to try!

A fun place to go for a celebration, a date, or family dinner."}
{"text":"\"You smell like smoke.\"  That's the greeting I received when coming home from a terrific UYE organized by BBQ lovin' Deb L.  And at that point, if my stuffed self didn't already know it, I knew I had just eaten some damn good food.

Upon arriving, I had a deja vu moment of being there before...a long time ago, sipping a virgin strawberry daiquiri (I told you it was a long time ago), and thinking I was all that.  Yes, it was Bobby McGee's at one time!  So flash forward 25 years, and I'm having a strawberry lemonade \"adult\" beverage, which was quite tasty btw, in the company of 20 fabulous Yelpers!

We were given corn bread pretty quickly, and it was devoured pretty quickly.  A little on the crumbly side, but delicious nonetheless.  Because my husband could not join us, I went with the 2-meat combo (brisket and pulled pork) so there would be some left to take him.  Yeah, that's my story.  I was a happy eater to find I could order my meats sauce free!  The brisket was good, but a little too fatty.  The pork was really good, however; adequately seasoned and smokey.  I tried the spicy sauce on the table, and found it to be just right, just a little kick to it.  For sides, the mac and cheese was creamy and not lacking in sauce.  Yum.  The roasted corn was really really good.  If corn always tasted that good, I would move to Iowa.

Our service was great and they were accommodating for our request for separate checks with a 20% gratuity.  Our service was actually good enough, especially given a party that size, that I tipped extra.  And I did refrain from eating all of my meal, so that I could have a nice lunch the next day when my husband refused my offer of the leftovers.  Only problem was he didn't refuse.  And I went hungry the next day, wishing I had eaten all of my meal when I had the chance."}
{"text":"It was amazing.. I love the drinks and food and the service was good too, treat u like a Queen."}
{"text":"Each bite into my food brought a tear to my eye. I will base my next trip to Phoenix around visiting this wonderful establishment again."}
{"text":"Yum! We shared the Whole Hog platter and loved everything: the baby back ribs, beef ribs, brisket, and sausage. My sons had a Perfect Burger and sirloin. Everything was 2 thumbs up. Good thing for the moist towelettes at the end bc we were a mess. Travis was a great server!"}
{"text":"Best food  always amazing service  great atmosphere every time love the cornbread cake 
Love the  pineapple drink    Great for dinner for 2 
Or amazing large party dinner"}
{"text":"Best beef brisket I've had yet.. and I don't normally like beef brisket.  

I had the lunch sampler thing at the suggestion of my bartender, who was friendly and helpful.  He also suggested the mac-n-cheese and although I didn't feel like mac-n-cheese I tried it.  This stuff was so damn good and the hot sauce he suggested I put on it was out of this world!  The cornbread was also a highlight of the meal.  

The sampler included ribs, bbq chicken and beef brisket.  Each were perfectly cooked, seasoned and super tender.  Of course I would recommend getting a little extra bbq sauce on the side, my preference was the hot which I loved!

They finish the meal off with a bag-o-donuts.. basically sugared doughballs.  Nonetheless they were very tasty and a nice, different take on a dessert for a bbq meal.

It was also nice that the bartender didn't scoff when I asked him to switch the tvs to ESPN (who wants to watch the news in the bar anyways?).  Not only that, but he put it up on all the tvs and raised the volume.  I had a really great lunch there and will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Growing up, Bobby McGee's Restaurant used to be a staple eatery that my family and friends loved. We knew we could get good food and enjoy a setting that was colorful, eclectic, and maybe even charming in its own special way... if that's not too far-fetched..all at the same time. Once I moved onto college, and others went their separate ways, we all forgot about Bobby McGee's. It would often be a topic that would arise at a dinner convo, \"What ever happened to that one place we used to go to near 27th Avenue and Northern?\" But that was all that ever materialized.

Luckily, I was reunited with this restaurant, now known as Bobby-Q's. It has since transitioned into a Kansas City/Texas mixture type barbecue, but still a great atmosphere! After a long day of rock climbing, my friends and I were famished and they suggested getting barbecue. Once we arrived, all the memories started flooding back of this place, and I love what it's become. The barbecue is really good! It's actually one of my favorites, I'm surprised to say. Three of us shared the Whole Hog Heaven, which is a major platter where you can choose 2 ribs, 2 meats, and 3 sides. Our selections: the Baby Back ribs, the beef ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket, potato salad, macaroni and cheese, and grilled veggies. The rib meat was tender and \"fall off the bone\" type texture. The  baby back ribs were by far my favorite of the bunch. 

While waiting for our order, our group also shared the smoked brisket Q-rolls with chipotle dip. These were really delicious but kind of reminded me of eating a mini chimi since the phylo dough was so flaky and crispy. There was a small heap of roasted corn served on the plate as well that was super smoky in flavor. 

Even though it is the middle of winter, the patio was still very comfortable since all the heaters overhead were on. There is a metal waterfall sculpture that extends the entire length of the patio so it is very soothing and entertaining to have the sound of \"rain\" behind you as you're eating outside. Ashlynn, our waitress, was very accommodating to our large group of 7 that even included 3 super energetic kids. She even treated us with extra doughnuts at the end when we were finishing our meal. We will definitely return again and again to Bobby Q's!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously good! The food was amazing, the service was great and it has a really fun atmosphere! The donuts they give u at the end of your meal are fantastic (and free!). I'd recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food. Waitstaff helpful in selecting portions and most popular items. We had ribs and brisket. The Q rolls (brisket served like an egg roll) are super."}
{"text":"If you can't give a real reason, then best not say anything at all. Not ever going back. Don't even have fun while you're here, they'll throw you out."}
{"text":"The last time I was here it was named something else and my waitress was dressed like a naughty cop. I was 16 then...now it has taken on a brand new face! I'm probably last to know that this place doubles as a night club.  A latin room and a hip hop club...it was amazing. I didn't get to eat dinner there so I can't speak for the BBQ but as far as the nightlife atmosphere in this area it gets 4 stars! Get there before 10, or the cover is $10 but still that isn't bad.  They have just about every spirit there, and even using the premium well is no more than 7 bucks. Will be going back real soon!!! I am still wondering how they got my number to text me specials...but i can't complain because they are sending me some good stuff."}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it. Food is great can't stop ordering take out. This is not a Texas restaurant but as close as Arizona can get too one. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"My first time here and I LOVED it! The BBQ sauce was excellent. I had the two meat platter with spicy sausage links and St. Louis ribs. Excellent!! The roasted corn side is excellent. I didn't get to try but the peach cobbler looked delicious. Next time!  I really like the ambience of the place. It had a cool vibe. This would be a great place to come for any occasion. Great for out of town guests or family dinner."}
{"text":"ok....first let me say that I grew up in PHX. And we used to go for special occasions to \"Bobby MaGees\" which is where BobbyQ's is now located (says something about the quality of my restaurant experiences as a young fella)...And as cheesy as Bobby McGaees was...i kind of miss the pirate serving me my dinner (and the salad bar in the bathtub).

But i do like what they have done to the place. Cool interior. Casual but with a nice upscale feel. The patio seemed really nice (didn't sit out here).

We tried a variety of things. A burger, a pulled pork sandwich, brisket, baby backs etc...

I think the standout were the ribs. VERY good...very tender (but not overcooked), good sauce.  I enjoyed every one.Everything else was just ok. Like on par with Chili's (which isn't saying much). 

The sides were pretty tasty. Corn (roasted and then taken off the cob for you) , mashed potatoes, cornbread...all pretty good. 

Dinner for 4 (2 kids, no booze)...50$.

But a 5 star place? Maybe in the context of other restaurants in the Dunlap and I-17 areas (next to crazy Mitch's Furniture barn.) But not in the broader context of PHX.

I would definitely go back for ribs...but not a place that will go into the normal rotation.

Side note: Hilarious crowd on a Saturday night. Lots of \"west side\" clubbers...or maybe too old to be clubbers but want to go clubbing (there is a lounge attached)."}
{"text":"I have never had BBQ in the South, Texas, or anywhere outside of California (except Bobby Q), but of all the places I've tried, Bobby Q is my current favorite BBQ place EVER!  I found this place on Yelp and came here while on a trip to Arizona.  The place was pretty crowded but we only  waited about 15-20 minutes.  We ordered babyback ribs, St. Louis ribs, corn, and mac&cheese.  They also give you DELICIOUS AMAZING CORNBREAD!

Everything was excellent.  The St. Louis ribs were the best ribs I have ever had.  They were extremely tender and had a nice flavorful bark on the  outside with dark grill marks.  Their BBQ sauce was equally awesome and the kind I like -- a bit more on the sweeter side, less on the vinegary side.  The babyback ribs were also tasty, but not as flavorful (and less meat of course) than the St. Louis ones.  The sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs.

I don't know if I will ever be in Phoenix again, but this place is a must-return if I ever am.  Oh and at the end of the meal, they gave us complimentary, piping hot FRESH cinnamon donuts!  That double-won me over.  I want Bobby Q right now."}
{"text":"My sister and I were seated very quickly and our server JT came right over.  He suggested an appetizer and it was on point!  They were the beef brisket rolls; I don't remember the actual name.  We asked which he preferred out of two items on the menu and was given a quick response. The service given to us by the entire staff was great,  even the manager came to ask us how we were.

The food was amazing.  We both got the Fried Chicken with gravy. We had mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. Everything was really delicious!! 
We both recommend this place to anyone looking for good food and a great night.  

P.S. The complimentary donuts are also really good!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were visiting Phoenix for Spring Training and staying at a near by hotel. As none of us were in a state to drive but desperately needed dinner we decided to check out Bobby Q. We were definitely worried about what we were getting ourselves into given the neighborhood surroundings but once we walked through the doors of Bobby Q we were pleasantly surprised.

The menu was incredible. Every BBQ option under the sun. All meals started with some great corn bread. The beer selection was phenomenal! We ordered a bunch of different things on the menu and loved every single one. Personally I had the rib combo plate and enjoyed every bite. My one regret was ordering the baked beans as one of my sides. It wasn't bad but just seemed average in comparison to everything else. Definitely get the mac and cheese!

This was definitely the best surprise of our trip and we will definitely be heading back next year!"}
{"text":"Had never been here before. The women sitting next to us told us we had to try the Q rolls which we did. Almost a \"brisket in a blanket\"  type appetizer. I like them best dipped in the chipotle sauce they came with, my husband liked them dipped in the barbecue sauce which was a little sweet for my taste.  I had a brisket sandwich with a baked potato and my husband had the salmon dinner with fries and mac & cheese. (yes, I made fun of him for getting salmon at a barbecue place-- but he said it was delicious!). Very large portions--- be prepared for a food coma afterwords!  The brisket was very good! The server was wonderful, and very knowledgeable about the menu. A nice touch was fresh made cinnamon donuts that were given to you at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"I have to say it was overall pretty good.  The location is nice.  I heard how wonderful the mac n cheese was supposed to be, and I did not like it.  It tasted very processed to me. Also, there was too much cheese in it.  The waiter we had was awesome, and the customer service was great.  I have had better bbq where I am from on the East coast, but it was not awful by any means.  I think the mini donuts are adorable.  Also, the cornbread was amazing.  I ate a piece, and I do not like cornbread usually.  I will come bk and give you guys another try in the future."}
{"text":"Have been to this place several times and just love it. Food is great and service is wonderful. Great atmosphere, a little pricey but it makes for a great date night!"}
{"text":"Luv, Luhv, LOVE their Whole Hog platter.  It's always enough to feed my family.  2 types of ribs, 2 meats, and 3 sides.  The service is always friendly, though my server out in the patio wasn't as good as the other servers I've had there before.  I'll eventually have to go back there again and try some of their other offerings.  Great BBQ!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while in town on business today.  Looked like the place was run down and on the way to being washed up when I pulled up into the parking lot.  Turns out that \"run down BBQ shack\" is the look that they were shooting for!

The inside is another matter.  Obviously a BBQ place.  But a very nice one indeed.  Nicer and with more personality than Famous Dave's or Lucille's.  If this is a chain, it doesn't feel like it.  I sat at the bar (as I usually do when traveling).  They have indoor and outdoor seating.  Both looked comfortable and fairly well lit.  And the place is CLEAN; including the restrooms!

The staff i dealt with was friendly and attentive without getting on your nerves.  Obviously experienced and well trained.

I had the baby back ribs with mac & cheese, and grilled vegetables.  The ribs were meaty and tender with an excellent BBQ sauce.  Meat came off the bone easily.  I ate them with a fork with no problem.  The meal came with good cornbread and butter.  The Mac & cheese was creamy and delicious.  And the vegetables were grilled just right without being too soft.

Don't be put off by the rustic appearance of Bobby Q's.  This is a well run restaurant that gets plenty of business.  And they should.  They have a smoker on premises, and smoke their ribs and brisket for the better part of a day.  They also dry age their own beef on premises.  I was told that the rib eye is superb.  But that will have to wait for another day.

If you like BBQ, I just don't see how you could have a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Who knows why I chose BBQ in Arizona when coming from Texas, but it was a great choice. They had a sweet kick to everything (their sauce and cornbread) which was a huge plus to me...but it wasnt overly, diabetic sweet. The lemonade tasted home made... and very good. 

I had to get a to go box and they gave cute little donuts when you are done. A little on the higher side price  for BBQ ( again, I'm from Texas), but I'd return!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  All staff was very nice, wait wasn't extremely bad (20 minutes).  Had the hog heaven and split it with a friend.  We still has plenty to take home.  Awesome cornbread!"}
{"text":"Really really good barbeque, and I'm a harsh critic.  Spending a lot of time in East Texas has me a bit of a bbq snob but this place didn't disappoint.  Good baby back ribs, good rotisserie chicken, good corn bread, and solid mash potatoes.  Also, great frozen strawberry lemonade.  Not the cheapest but I don't mind considering I was satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is the best barbecue I've had in Phoenix so far. For some reason I expected a cafe-style joint given that most places in Arizona are run that way but instead we were greeted with a big, fully decorated roadhouse style building with a huge patio and fancy interior. They even had a separate bar area which I plan to try out soon. I was told it was overpriced and overrated by my in-laws and it was everything but that! We both got a sampler platter which comes with three meat choices, a side, cornbread, and little unexpected fried sugar dough thingers to send you off. I'm usually expecting dried meat and sides that taste like they've been sitting out but everything was perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy. I was even impressed by the corn that had a sweet smokey flavor to it. Only $26 before tax for two people as well. Service was great, energetic, and helpful as well. We took home what little scraps we had and had a midnight snack that reheated well too. I can't wait to come back with friends and family to show them a \"cooler\" version of claim jumpers."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ and great sides. Brisket and Pulled Pork are amazing! Pulled chicken and ribs are good too! Mac and cheese is phenomenal! Shoestring fries are a plus. Food comes out super fast! Q-rolls are a must as an appetizer. Sangria is great as a drink, but is a little pricey. They give you donuts at the end, which are pretty delicious! They have great desserts. Would suggest reservations during the busy times! Service is always fantastic. We had them cater for our rehearsal dinner and they did an amazing job. One of the best BBQ joints in the valley!"}
{"text":"Brought our out of town company (out of country even!) looking for a good local style food that wasn't Mexican.  So glad to have discovered this place!  Good service, very friendly staff, and of course, great food!"}
{"text":"If you like meat, Go here. I got the 3 meat combo. It was big. It takes 2 to down this. The staff at the bar was great. Also the manager stopped by. Cool place to go. Food was really good. Eat people, eat here."}
{"text":"BLOWN AWAY by this place! my husband and i just moved here less than 2 weeks ago, we wanted bbq so we came on yelp and say this place had great reviews, and decided to try it with absolutely no idea what to expect. this place is INCREDIBLE! its a lot nicer than we were expecting, we thought it'd just be some hole in the wall with great food... maaan were we wrong! awesome craft beer selection, great craft cocktails, the cornbread is epic, bbq brisket sandwich melted in my mouth and had an amazing smoking flavor that cannot be achieved by cutting corners.. bbq sauce was delicious, mac n cheese is legendary and super creamy, mashed potatoes made me hear angels sing, shoestring fries were surprisingly above average, and as if we weren't already in heaven enough, they bring you a bag of fresh cinnamon sugar donuts to take home. i can now die happy. seriously it was so good that they could have come to our table at the end and told me it was human flesh we'd just eaten and i woulda been like f it, i guess im a cannibal now cause im 100% gonna eat that again."}
{"text":"Had the brisket and it was so so so so so soft. Delicious. The cornbread was also great and I liked the sauces, although the spicy didn't have much of a kick. The only disappointing bit was the Mac and Cheese. It tasted like it came out of a Velveeta box :/."}
{"text":"Cheap Beer, Platters full of BBQ Meat, Good Music, and Basketball on the TV.

How can this not be an awesome place?!?!

Another gem of a find from Yelp while staying in Phoenix. Again, out of the way, from where we were staying anyway.  Another place smack dab in the middle of a neighborhood. Another place with friendly service, amusing barfly regulars, and good food.  If it weren't so hot in Phoenix, I'd have a crisis about living arrangements!

Happy Hour in the bar was great: $3.00 large beers on tap and 1/2 off appetizers. We shared some hot wings which were very tasty. I wanted more of those, for sure.

After about 3 or 4 beers, we went with the Whole Hog Feast. The name alone is awesome!  For 36 bucks we got:
-Baby Back Ribs
-St. Louis Ribs
-Pulled Pork
-Beef Brisket
-Mac N. Cheese
-Cole Slaw
-Baked Potato
-Cornbread

Um, hello?!?! This was so much food and it was all good!  The cornbread was sweet and had great texture; meat was tender and flavorful, mac n cheese was rich and creamy. A little spicy bbq sauce on the side to kick everything up was a nice addition. Mouth is watering a little now just typing it out!  Although we were stuffed (and had a full to go box ready), we had to try the Peach Cobbler. So good.

Again, if I lived nearby, my pants would be in serious jeopardy of fitting properly! =)"}
{"text":"The 4 stars is for Friday night happy hour only!! It runs from 4-8pm and they have an outstanding complimentary buffet! The drink specials are decent. You can get a double well drink for the price of a single, and they pour nicely. 
Back to the buffet - I'm pretty sure it is only on Fri, but the buffet has tacos, nachos, fruit, veggies, and a beef brisket."}
{"text":"My waistline theories go like this: if it's free, the calories don't count. This goes for items like free bread, butter, candies at the end of the meal and especially the free donuts they give me before I leave Bobby Qs. Those definitely do not count towards my waistline. Bobby Qs is a your run of the mill BBQ restaurant with fun (and slightly cheesy) decor, fatty yet satisfying and tasty food and overall a fun time. This restaurant is hidden off of random side streets but the catch is that you can see it from the 17. 

Like I said, the food here is fatty but pretty good. Expect BBQ food with a chain-like feel. The atmosphere is the same. In summary, if you're in the area and get hungry, this is a great option. I think it would also be fun for a low key group dinner. Plus, they serve those donuts. Yum."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here for years. The food is fantastic. In house smoked meats are some of the best BBQ in town. The steak and crab leg special on Saturdays is my favorite. At $18.00 you can't go wrong. Great beer selection clean glasses and always cold. They strive for great service and we have always had a pleasant experience.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I know a thing or two about a good BBQ being from the midwest.  Let me tell you that Bobby Q's is a good good day. 

The doughnuts at the end are wonderful. 

I recommend hittin' this place up on a Sunday when you can get the family chicken/ribs/pork/brisket with 2 sides combo.  

If I'm ever back in Phoenix I'll be over at Bobby Q's."}
{"text":"2000+ reviews and rated nearly 5 stars? Why, yes please!

What an incredible experience. This was by far the best BBQ spot I've ever been to. Great ambiance, with both indoor and outdoor seating options, great service, a wonderful dinner vibe, and most importantly, the  best tasting food!

On a nice evening, I'd recommend, if possible, to sit at the outdoor patio.  Outdoor string lights cover the patio. It's sort of dim inside but with bright lighting above each table. Instead of waiting for a table, three of us sat at the bar. With a couple TVs, we were able to catch up on sports.

Among our group we ordered the beef brisket and ribs. When they say a full rack of ribs, you get a full, meaty rack. The sides included shoestring fries, grilled vegetables, roasted corn, sautéed mushrooms, and mac n' cheese. The mac n' cheese was the star side of the show while the ribs were the best I have ever tasted. When our food arrived, I was immensely in a better mood (I was already in good mood seeing how awesome the place was). When I tasted the food, I couldn't have been in a happier place. The brisket was delicious but clearly, the ribs are something truly special.

You get 10% off for checking in on Yelp. I forgot to use it but everything was so amazing I didn't care.

This place is highly recommended and I would absolutely without a doubt go to Bobby Q again."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq... Excellent service.... Had the baby back ribs in the meat fell off the bone. The coleslaw was excellent as well as the mac & cheese!  We'll definitely be back! Thank u Yelp for the 10% off"}
{"text":"Free sides of corn bread and donuts for desserts? Sure! The food was very tasty and price is pretty average for a bbq joint. My baby back ribs were delicious, but they are too fall off the bone if you get my point. I prefer ribs that still cling to the bone, but can be pulled off easily as well. To each their own. The sauces were amazing and the portions are ridiculously huge. Sharing is recommended if you don't want to take home leftovers."}
{"text":"Good bbq and super busy. Made a reservation via Yelp and was glad I did because it was packed out when we arrived at 8pm.

Our server, Jonah, was super nice and helpful with the menu.

We got St Louis ribs, sausage, brisket, potato salad, Mac n cheese, baked beans and grilled veggies.

The sides were good...mac n cheese was creamy and cheesy, veggies were grilled just right, baked beans were flavorful and pieces of brisket were in them and the potato salad was seasoned well.

The sausage was a nice combination of seasonings and pork with not to much fat. They advertised it as spicy but I didn't notice any heat.

The brisket had a nice ratio of fat and meat and the ribs were tender.

Overall good bbq at a little higher price than I'd pay normally but it's a more upscale restaurant and the service was very good."}
{"text":"I was really torn on giving them four stars.  But the main entree was  just not something I would come back for.  

Everything started out great.  Our server was on top of it.  Her name is Shay, and girl, you are just a SuperServer.  She is five stars.  She is excellence in itself.

The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty good, casual yet upscale bbq joint.  They nailed that.

One thing to note is that all the meats are smoked for over 20 hours.  Sounds good!  We own a smoker, and the longest we had smoked anything was 8 hours.

For the appetizer, we ordered the Q rolls;  Tortilla wrapped brisket deep fried and served with chipotle sauce.  YUMMY!  Delicous!  If I come back, I will order these again.  The cornbread everyone raved about was alright..

For the main entree we split the 3  meat combo;  the pork, brisket, and sausage.  For the sides we had mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese.  Sure glad we shared.  It was alot of food.

This  is where it falls for me.  Maybe I went on an off day; but the meats were disappointing, especially after hearing they have been smoked for 20 hours. It was not flavorful or delectable or anything, just meat that was edible.  Even drowning it in bbq sauce didn't make it anymore appetizing for me. The mashed potatoes were very very BLAND.  I salt and peppered them to death trying to flavor them a bit.  The mac and cheese was very creamy, and was decent, but...I make tastier mac at home, thought not as creamy.  Its sad for me to convey this; I really was not satisfied with my meal.

Now the doughnuts they provided at the end of the meal was fresh and good. 

I don't know if I will be back, mainly because I want to try other restaurants and there are so many options out there.  But when I finish my quest to attempt different types of eateries, Bobby Q is not a place I would write off."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  We got the Q-rolls and people aren't kidding - they were delicious.  I had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.  Everything was really good.  My husband had ribs and brisket and scarfed them down.  I was really stunned by the prices though - really high in my opinion.  Food was good, service was good, but it was pricy enough to prevent me from returning on a regular basis.  Entrees ranged from $17-40."}
{"text":"Anytime is a good time for barbecue. The smell of burning wood, the sweet thick or vinegary sauces and meat that just fall off the bone -- these elements have mass appeal to my senses.

So it's probably no surprise that I've been to most Valley smokehouses to check out their goods.

My latest exploration, Bobby-Q, came after a day of bargain hunting at a clearance outlet at Metrocenter. So much shopping can work up an appetite, and you'll need an appetite since the prices at Bobby-Q are low and the portions are large.

The location might be familiar to many longtime Phoenicians -- it was Bobby McGee's until about five years ago. I have many fond memories eating there with my family as a kid.

While the building got a $3 million dollar makeover, the charm and coziness is intact. It's sort of a cowboy chic with dim lighting, stained concrete floors and a tin ceiling. The seating is comfortable and the service friendly and efficient. If you're in a hurry, you can call ahead; there is a separate entrance for to-go orders.

Everything on the menu is made in house, from the barbecue sauce to the fluffy corn bread. Being an avid home cook I can appreciate these extra steps.

Always wanting to try something new, the Q-Rolls ($7.50) are a take on a Mexican flauta. Filled and rolled with smoked beef brisket and then deep-fried to a golden brown, these looked better than they tasted. The roll's open ends allowed for far too much oil to penetrate the meaty interior, which ended up a tasteless crunch.

A steakhouse classic, the Wedge Salad ($5), is made with a quarter of crisp head lettuce, sprinkled with smoked bacon, chopped tomatoes and bleu cheese crumbles. I can never resist the power of blue cheese and bacon.

The menu includes entree-sized salads, sandwiches and steaks, but my focus was on smoked meats. You can order two or three meat platters, but I opted for the Whole Hog ($36), a choice of two ribs, two meats and three sides.

When the plate arrived, my eyes widened. Huge slabs of Baby Back Ribs and St. Louis-Style Ribs were framed by piles of pulled pork and beef brisket, it's quite the mother lode of meat, so be prepared to share with others.

Going straight to the ribs, I grabbed a bone and it immediately separated from the rib meat. The meat was melt-in-your -mouth tender, and rightly so; they cook their meats low and slow for about 20 hours.

With all of the meat loving going on, it's easy to forget the sides. The Mac 'n Cheese was creamy and gooey and was worth ordering again. Pecan Cole Slaw was good, but I especially liked the toasted pecans, hich provided a nice contrast. Roasted Corn comes topped with a few wheels of corn on the cob. I wish the entire dish were served this way, since the kernels were swimming in a pool of butter.

After finishing this feast, there couldn't possibly be room for Peach Cobbler ($6.50) or Mud Pie ($6.50). But it was a nice touch that the check was brought out with a small bag of hot fresh cinnamon and sugar-covered donuts."}
{"text":"On our recent trip here I decided to try the Southern Fried Chicken. It was very juicy and extremely tasty. The chicken was also boneless which made it very easy to eat. The chicken was also skinless but still had their own \"skin\" on it with their seasonings. Very tasty indeed! It came with a side of white gravy which was perfect to drizzle on top or dunk in each bite. The piece of chicken was quite large so I definitely have left overs. I again had to have the side of their mac n cheese as it's so yummy."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience. Had such a wonderful dinner tonight here. Had a minor incident (really was not a big deal!) and all night we were joking with the server about it because we thought it was the funniest thing. At some point he must have relayed this to the manager (it really was not a big deal at all!!) who walked over and comped our entire meal. In turn we left a huge tip to the server because he worked hard and deserved it. Thank you to the female manager that was on duty tonight, you went above and beyond the call of duty. Your kindness was uncalled for and you really went the extra mile to take care of us. It really was not necessary but still very much appreciated.!! This is the kind of positive experience you never forget. We will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"Favorite BBQ place in all of Phoenix! Favorite family spot for birthday dinners. Many options for everyone to choose from. The cornbread is amazing! Be sure to ask for seconds. Great ambiance and environment. The mini donuts after the meal are delicious too!"}
{"text":"i'm torn. on the one hand, the service was superb, we liked the actual dining experience, and some of the food was great (mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, cornbread, wings, donuts, arnold palmer cocktail). on the other hand, i went for some RIBS and that is where they failed me. i had whet my appetite last week at pork on a fork where i had some seriously tasty ribs. like i wanted to climb up onto the plate and roll around in them, that is how good they were. so now i'm on this bbq blitz and it was my birthday so i requested to come to bobby q based on reviews seeming so positive, like supposedly best bbq in phoenix! anyway, got baby back ribs and you couldn't even pick up a rib that is how much the meat fell off. like literally reached for a bone and all i got was bone, meat stayed on the plate. it was like a gelatinous mess. there should be some bite, some crispy parts from the smoker, something! and i wasn't crazy about the sauce - ribs were way over-sauced, like sauce got slapped on right before they went on the plate and i did not care for the flavor of it. no choice of sauce, yet when we were packing up our leftovers the waitress appeared with two different kinds in to-go containers. huh? so i wonder if i had ordered something else if i would have been happier, but still. truthfully, i doubt i will come back unless someone else makes me and if i do i will stay away from ribs."}
{"text":"The decor of the restaurant made you feel that you were transported to a different place from Phoenix. My husband and I ordered the Whole Hog Heaven to share. For the ribs, we chose the baby back and beef; meat brisket and chicken (bone-in); sides mashed potatoes, mix veg and corn. The portion was generous and the BBQ was delicious. The only thing was there was not enough BBQ sauce on top and we needed to ask for extra. The food came pretty quickly but since we were seated at the booth that belonged to the bar, our waiter/bartender was busy and we needed to wait to get his attention. We didn't get any dessert but were given some fresh mini-donuts to go. That was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"As a relatively new transplant from the Bay Area I lamented the lack of great , independently owned restaurants here in the Phoenix area- particularly given that I live pretty far north up the 17 near Happy Valley with little more than national chains. But a friend suggested I try this place for great BBQ so last week I took the 17 minute drive and was absolutely knocked out on a number of levels. 

The service of this establishment is superb. It is one of the best managed restaurants I've ever patronized and the staff, from the bartender to the server all operated at a very high standard. 

Now as for the food, one night I had their St Louis style ribs SANS the extra sauce ( I am a dry rub guy) and they were superb. Not fatty at all, tasty,  and the meat fell off the bone. Good fries and a very nice pecan coleslaw. Buy the chicken tender appetizer? OMG! By far and away the best I have had anywhere in the country!

Last night I enjoyed the fried chicken which is actually a butterflied breast of chicken - also excellent. The friendly gentleman sitting next to me at the bar had their prime rib and LOVED it. It looked AWESOME!

A big shout out to the manager Taylor who handled a minor issue ( my bad, not Bobby Q) in a MOST professional way. If in Phoenix you absolutely MUST go and if you're coming in for only 3 or 4 days, I would absolutely recommend you place Bobby Q on your list as those restaurants you simply cannot overlook on your trip to the desert."}
{"text":"Bobby Q has being in the restaurant business down pat. When you first walk in, it seem sort of up scale. The waitress we had seemed new, but was very nice and was sure to remember everything. The food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time and was tasty. I had their Fish Fry Friday and I think the fish could have been seasoned a little more. I found myself using more of the tartar sauce because of the lack of seasoning on the fish. They do this thing with homemade donuts which I think is a great happy ended. I am the type of person that does need a little bit of sweet at the end of my meal and that was perfect."}
{"text":"I have not been here in a long time, and man Bobby Q's has really stepped up their game. Same location, same awesome feel with better food and service.

We had a great time! The baby back rips were spot on, the pulled pork was nice and moist, and the brisket had very little fat on it. The side were all fantastic as well. Extra cheesy Mac and Cheese and fluffy mashed potato's. This was all washed down with there house beer, which was a Red from Sedona Brewing. No complaints at all on the food.

The service was also great! My pops was in town from Florida so we all went out and our server was more then accommodating the kids and all of our needs. He did a fantastic job, and had several other tables besides ours. 

Plus you get a little bonus before and after your meal. Bonus number 1, 10% off your bill when you do a yelp check in. Bonus 2, corn bread brought to you before your meal. Bonus 3, after your meal you get cinnamon  donuts. 

I am looking forward to going back and thankfully this is one of the few BBQ places that is a reasonable distance from my house."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience here good food good service really delicious bbq ribs and the little donuts in the brown bag were delicious. Would go back. Really good food won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were visiting in this area of Phoenix looking for a good dinner.  Well, we ended up with an even better dinner than we were looking for.  The atmosphere was great along with a superb wait staff.  The baby back ribs were fantastic along with the sides and peach cobbler.  This was a great choice and we will be coming back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Everything was 5 stars: food, service, ambiance. 

I had the St. Louis ribs, beef brisket, coleslaw, roasted corn, corn bread and I tried the pulled pork. Again - all outstanding. The ribs really stood out for smokiness and tender. I have to say too that the coleslaw was among the best I have ever eaten (pecan coleslaw). Oh yeah - constant re-supply of incredible cornbread biscuits!

As much as the food, the service was noticeably top notch. Various servers kept us informed about their role (drinks, taking order, bringing food, etc.) and our main server was attentive and well paced. The manager checked in and asked how we were enjoying our meal. Even the hostess gave us good information about where to sit. 

Venue: great lighting, comfortable seating, roomy (but not too much) tables and well managed noise level. All good.

Value: $55 for two including tip and one drink each. Wow - for that meal, service and atmosphere, a tremendous value. Go here."}
{"text":"It's crazy to think that I am just now writing a review for Bobby Q's! My first experience with Bobby Q's was a few years back and I still think to this day that it is some of the best BBQ I have had. The great thing about Bobby Q's is that its not all about the BBQ but they also have really amazing burgers, appetizers, and those delicious little cinnamon sugar donuts at the end! Just the thought of those little pillowy sugary donuts makes me drool! Q rolls as an appetizer is a must and their spinach and artichoke dip is fantastic as well. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anybody who was looking for really delicious BBQ!"}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ joints I've ever been to. My friend and I both ordered the Whole Hog Heaven which we probably should have just split. Large portion of food that left us full without completely draining our wallets. The complimentary mini donuts at the end of the meal were a nice surprise."}
{"text":"My fiance and I loved our meal here: we would say overall 4.5 but rounded up. Our server Zac was fabulous! He did not miss a beat. Loved the cornbread. The fiance loved the Q-rolls but they weren't my jam. We shared the 3 meats combo. They were out of sausage so we split the brisket, pork (my favorite), and ribs (his favorite).  It was so nice of them to provide us with 2 plates with all of the meats split so we could sample everything. I also tried the mango margarita which was fabulous and the perfect bite and sweetness. I loved the creaminess of the mac but the fiance wasn't too impressed. Shoestings delivered but were nothing special. Overall, I was very happy and we left with leftovers. The churro spiced light donuts were also fabulous. I just love the feel of this place."}
{"text":"Wow...  I'm from California and we don't really have any BBQ there, so I like to indulge a little when I travel.   Last month I was in Ft Worth, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, and New Orleans.    People there  said I had to try the Salt Lick in Round Rock (outside of Austin), and it was \"ok\"... I thought at the time.. \"ok, it's above average\"... I thought maybe I didn't really have a taste for it. 

New Orleans Jambalaya can't be matched... I'll leave it at that.  I didn't try the gumbo at Bobby Q, I just thought I would be disappointed after New Orleans a couple of weeks ago.   Brisket was unbelievable, also the best I've ever had. 

I tried the 3-meat combo and had chicken, St. Louis ribs, and brisket.   All were over the top, the brisket especially.  The ribs were very large and very tender.. probably the best I've ever had (anywhere). 

Mac & Cheese is supposedly their specialty... it was good, but I've had better, it wasn't that memorable but I didn't leave any behind either.  Baked potato side ... I wasn't happy with it, seemed under cooked or something.   I usually have a salad at least once a day, but I didn't try it at Bobby Q, I assumed it wasn't their thing. 

Ambiance was excellent but I opted to sit in the patio, it was a beautiful night, but what a mistake.   It was only occupied by a work-party or something and they were rather ripped, drunk, and to the point of talking about what it's like to travel in the south as a gay man, etc... kind of crude and I wasn't interested, neither was anyone else... higher class places would have asked them to leave. (I dinged the score for this).  After the crowd had it's fill of drinking, they turned to smoking... Oh My ... Yuck... haven't seen that in about a decade... One nice thing about California... smoking is fine, as long as it's 200 feet from anyone else.  The patio has a cover that is low and curved at the sides, it held the smoke in like an airship.   After 20 minutes, I was really gagging and it made the food taste awful.   Smokers... I know you like to light up after dinner, but you don't smoke \"during\" dinner.  Why is that?  Makes the food taste nasty? Yes... it does... learn to be considerate and take it outside for people that are eating and paying as well.   Took any desire for dessert away, I just wanted to leave at that point. 

If not for the smoking (which should really be banned in the constrained area), and the mediocre sides I would have given it 5 stars.   As it is, solid 4 (meat was that good)."}
{"text":"Bomb!! Everything is just delicious. My man feel asleep at the table lol. That's how you know it's good"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I tried the St. Louis style ribs and they were right in the description.. They fell off the bone and had a good bark as well. The salads were great (which I also had). I was expecting a plain boring salad but no; It was delightful with plenty of veggies and extras. I didn't particularly care for the side of ranch beans, felt like they could have done a better job with making those tastier.. Also loved their complimentary \"thank Q\" doughnuts.. They were warm and tasted somewhat like a churro... The ambiance was fun and pleasing to the eye and I even heard their a night club on the other side of the restaurant which sounds like fun too. Overall I suggest anyone to come try this place, I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is 10 stars. My husband was looking up BBQ in Phoenix and came upon this place so on the way to Sedona we stopped by. 
The area looks like there wouldn't be a restaurant and the parking lot is not to appeling but once you hot the side and see the patio and inside man this place is nice and the food is GOOD!! There was 7 of us and we got sat fast. I had the BBQ chicken and mash and I ate it all and I never finish my food. My husband had the Sampler plate and he loved it. The corn bread is good. After your meal they bring a bag a freshly fried donuts and sugar. This place is soooooooooooooooooo good. When we come back to Phoenix we will go there again. Best BBQ we have tasted by far."}
{"text":"I read a review here saying the ribs were as good as PHIlS BBQ in California. I did not believe it since Phils has award winning ribs. Well I was wrong. This place has the best ribs in Arizona. You will not leave disappointed one bit when you leave. The manager Krissy was super nice. I highly recommend you come check this place out."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ! We ordered beef ribs, baby back ribs, and a brisket sandwich. Apparently, their meat is smoked for 22 hours or more. The ribs were super tender and the brisket was juicy. The sides we ordered, corn, shoestring fries, and mac n cheese were good as well. Also included in the meal was cornbread. That little guy was delicious! Would we come back? We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix for a family vacay and we were lucky to find this great place.  Best BBQ ribs I've had and  customer service is EXCELLENT!  We ordered take out,wait time was minimal.  Wish we had one in Cali."}
{"text":"Went on A Mothers-day thought it would be over packed but it wasn't . Table for four seated quickly. Ribs, steaks, barbecue pork sandwich all was excellent and the free bags of doughnuts as a desert was a nice touch."}
{"text":"My family & friends were visiting from out of town and randomly stopped by to have dinner at Bobby Q's in Phoenix Az. Not sure what to expect, we were blown away by the best service we have ever experienced, anywhere!  Not only was the service exceptional, the food was absolutely delicious! I'm a pretty picky eater and the food was beyond what I expected.  We all shared. We ordered ribs, prime rib, pulled pork, and the amazing Q's for an appetizer. We finished with a mud pie and banana freeze dessert.  While waiting to be sat all the way to finishing our meal, we were educated about the extensive preparation that goes into their food, Bobby Q's brewed beer (which was very good!), and all of the ways they prepare all of the food on the menu.  A HUGE thank you to manager Jack Lineberger!!  He was awesome and made our experience awesome enough to post on Yelp.  Thank you Jack!  We will stop by the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Better than Wagyu I had at Roka Akor in Scottsdale 

Hubby and I stopped here for lunch after reading the reviews on Yelp. I ordered the prime rib and shrimp chimichurri combo. Husband ordered 2 meat combo with chicken and brisket. Both meals were OUT OF BOUNDS. My prime rib was BETTER than the $250 Wagyu I ordered at Roka Akor. Waaaay better. Drinks are equally outstanding. I had an old fashioned that was yum. Serina-thank you for the phenomenal top-notch service! Good luck on your test next Saturday!!! And manager Joanna-thank you for quickly responding to meat readiness. I wanted it a little less red and it was resolved in minutes. No waiting!!! The food, drink and service were incredible.  Will tell everyone I know to come here."}
{"text":"We had a big family dinner here Friday night (14 people) and had such a great experience!! The Q rolls are one of the yummiest things I've ever eaten; I had filet and my boyfriend had the ribs & various meat platter and it was all SO GOOD. I see why this restaurant has such great ratings, the fresh donuts at the end of the meal just top it off. We'll be back soon for sure"}
{"text":"The service my family and I received (dining with five adults and two cranky little ones) was phenomenal! Our waitress couldn't have been nicer and the manager checked on us and made sure we were getting good food and good service. The food was great too and we thought it was a good value because we all shared the biggest barbecue platter (and the kids shared a kids meal, which was split for them and they were given extra fries) and it was more than enough food (we even took home some leftovers). GREAT experience all around: such a kind and lovely waitress plus delicious food!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner with my friend. The meat was really good especially the huge beef rib!! I can say that it is one of the best bbq in az!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! One of my favorite places. Recommend going earlier in the evening because there is always a very long wait! We usually wait about an hour every time. There is very little seats to wait so usually have to stand. Huge parking lot so never have a hard time finding a spot to park. Location is a little odd because you have to drive through a residential area. Overall cool place!"}
{"text":"We had to stop by to visit this highly Yelp ranked BBQ restaurant.  And we are happy we did.

Venue: (5/5) place is big and without a doubt has that southern country feel.  There is outside and inside seating.  We came in the winter so the outside was not an option.

Food (4/5) 
BBQ ribs and a side of Mac and cheese (5/5) - My friend is not big into food and is still talking about the amazing ribs and the creamy Mac & cheese!!!! Ask for the BBQ sauces if you want to smother more amazing calories on your meal (like me).  

Corn bread (5/5) the best I've ever eaten WOW

Warm donuts to bring home (3/5) not the best but free and warm

Service (5/5) warm and friendly"}
{"text":"What a great find on a Friday night... great BBQ and amazing southern charm and hospitality. Complimentary corn bread to start and cinnamon mini donut in a little paperbag to go! And, the BBQ was good!!"}
{"text":"If there is one thing Bobby knows how to do, that is how to que! Second time visiting this place and first time in a year. This visit made me wonder why I gave up meat for almost a year of my life. They may want to reconsider a name change to flavor town because your taste buds are ambushed by an abundance of flavor from every which way. I had the Jumbo BBQ Potato topped with brisket and a side of Mac n Cheese and it was phenomenal! I can't remember the last time I had a meal this enjoyable and delicious where I savored every bite. The brisket was cooked perfectly, little to no fat, juicy, tender, and flavorful. The barbeque sauce was full of flavor, not too thin, not too thick, and it had the perfect amount of tang to it. The Mac n Cheese was full of cheesy flavor. It went really well when paired with the barbeque sauce. I poured a little over the Mac n Cheese to give it a little extra flavor. The place was packed and they said we had about a 45 min wait and ended up waiting only 15 or so minutes. The service was great as well. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ place I've ever had... never given a restaurant a 5 star but this one deserves it.. everything was on point from the cornbread all the way to free dessert when u leave.. try the ribs and the brisket (stay away from the beef ribs and get the pork ribs)"}
{"text":"I would give 6 stars if I could. This place has it all! The food, the service, and the atmosphere is always on point. I've never had a problem in all of my visits here. 

-The Service
My first time at Bobby Q, the Server greeted us (My Girlfriend and I) with an awesome attitude. She explained that their signature ribs are smoked for 22 hours, and a brief history about the company. There's usually a Manager circling around to make sure everyone is satisfied.

-The Food
My Girlfriend and I always order the 2 Rib Combo, I get the St. Louis Style, She gets the Baby Back. Believe me when I say, the meat literally and I mean literally falls off the bone with no effort at all! The sauce tastes amazing and they're not stingy with it. One of the highlights is the cornbread. Now, if you know me at all, I used to hate cornbread. But Bobby Q has changed my mind. The cornbread is very tasty and you can actually taste the real corn.

-Atmosphere
Kinda gives you a feel of an indoor picnic. They have unique seating. I personally like seating in the booths facing the TVs at the Bar. They usually have sports games on (NFL, MLB, NBA etc...) I believe at a certain time, it changes into a Night Club, which I have yet to try. I haven't tried their drinks yet, but I'm looking forward to it.

I would recommend Bobby Q to anyone I know. No matter how busy they are, they make sure their customers are happy. And they do get pretty busy. That's expected with the amazing food and service they have. Kudos to the Owner and Managers. And thank you to the wonderful staff! I'll definitely be back! - Gabriel Salazar"}
{"text":"Great BBQ spot in Phoenix area. I came to eat here from out of town and was impressed by the excellent service despite high volume when I arrived. The food was incredibly good and fast. I waited longer to order vs actually receiving the food. Very good flavoring and pricing reasonable. Recommended 100%!!!"}
{"text":"The price of that Sunday special is now under $40 but it's still a value!

Bobby Q is still a regular for our household. We LOVE the ribs which fall off the bone as you pick them up from the plate, the mac and cheese which has a mild tang and the sweet, buttery corn. 

Even if you don't go on Sunday, Bobby Q offers some great family-size platters at a reasonable price in a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sorry to disagree with so many happy consumers but I just paid nearly $20 for very poor beef brisket. It's one thing to smoke the meat until its tender but quite another to cook it to an almost mushy texture. Couldn't even pick up the brisket with a fork-it fell apart. That's not tenderness on a BBQ scale. The grilled veggies were 3/4 large chunks of bell pepper...meh. I really wanted to love this meal but came away feeling like I paid far too much"}
{"text":"They are just great, here! The food AND the service!!! I have NEVER been disappointed. Even if something has slipped a server's mind, they have immediately owned it and rectified the issue. I recently did a pretty big take out order for 10 and when I went to pick it up, the worker asked me to go over it with him while he boxed it all to make sure nothing got missed! My family has been going here for years...we treat our of town guests to it and, I imagine, we'll keep it up for years to come!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Some of the best BBQ I've had in a long time.  The pulled pork was succulent and the brisket was juicy and tasty.  Enjoyed the complimentary donuts after our meal.  

Thanks for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"A must go to place when in town. Best BBQ EVER!

The service is great and this is a great place for groups. Especially when getting the hog heaven. 

Brisket, sausage, chicken, corn bread."}
{"text":"Based on the recommendation of my peer yelper's, my wife and I tried this while in Phoenix. I have to say we were not disappointed at all. This was AMAZING! 

Our server was Alexis and she did a really great job. Great positive energy and made us feel very welcome. She was on point with our food and follow up on our needs. Excellent customer service!!!

The appetizer we tried was the Q rolls which is a brisket spring roll with two sauces. They hit the spot and were super tasty. The cornbread was a nice touch as well with a little butter and then with the bean sides for the meal. 

We ordered the Hog Heaven meal which the description states it is great for yourself or to share with someone else.....Hmmm no this is enough for you, your friend, and another friend lol. 

I was expecting small portions so you get a taste. You get to pick two of the three rib styles. These are not just one or two ribs. You get a half rack of two different styles of ribs. Then you get three meat choices plus three sides. These are all regular portions not small mini portions.

I am a big guy and really enjoy BBQ. Between my wife and I we did not finish this meal there was enough left for a whole other meal.

The food is smoked on site and you can taste the nice smoke flavor in the meat which is tender and juicy. The ribs have a lot of meat on them with just a touch of crispiness on the outside. The meat was fall off the bone tender. The brisket was so moist and tender it was incredible. The sausage is absolutely home made! You can taste the difference in the sausage and texture. The chicken is super tender and again full of moisture even the chicken breast was juicy. 

The pecan colesaw, ranch beans, and the mac & cheese were all super tasty sides!

If you are in the area I would highly recommend stopping and checking out some amazing BBQ."}
{"text":"We had an awesome dinner with4 other friends tonight  all enjoyed our meals  so much food the corn bread is awesome and the warm donuts at the end of the meal  are amazing   i did think my potato was a little dry and you could tell by the cheese but other than that  i would still go back  our waiter was Hunter he was as good as the meal  so nice and kind and very helpful   he had a very Happy personality..."}
{"text":"The food was incredible, huge portions!  Our server Amanda by far the greatest we've seen in hospitality!"}
{"text":"Food was great and service was even better! Scott was fantastic. there was a little wait wait for our food and the manager offered a free desert on her."}
{"text":"I have used Bobby Q'S for years for major events and dinner. I not only would try to eat here as much as possible I catered them for my wedding reception, and several family parties. 

So since I have moved to Houston I went here as soon as I came home. For Texas to be known for BBQ I can say Bobby slays the majority of them with his cooking. Not only is all the meat good but the side dishes are out of this world. 

We ordered the Whole hog heaven which is a BBQ lovers dream. We choose both Baby back ribs and St. Louis-TENDER FALL OF THE BONE

Brisket-Incredible but most importantly consistent. for all the years I have been coming it is always melt in your mouth incredible.

Chicken-So tender and smoky I die

Sides
Mac and Cheese-Always so delicious although this time it was slightly off, I couldn't put my finger on it. I would like to believe it was just a bad batch, because its always so creamy and full of velvetta, YES.

Potato Salad-Perfectly seasoned too perfection, Served super cold and reminds you of summer.

Corn bread-From scratch moist and sweet. You could eat a pound of these.

BBQ Sauces-Hot and Reg-Thick, balanced and rich the only type of sauce that should be on BBQ. Think Sweet Baby Rays X10

Last the complimentary donuts- DO NOT MISS THESE TREASURES."}
{"text":"Favorite part you get fresh made donuts at the end , they have leveled up the food experience to a whole new level !!"}
{"text":"It's got everything a great BBQ place needs - great selection of meats always cooked to perfection, great tasting sauce, sweet tea, Mac n cheese, sweet potatoes and peach cobbler! Service is always friendly and timely. As a native Texan who lives here in the valley this is the best place I've found. The only negative is the location."}
{"text":"Not a place I frequent but found the food and service to be very good! My drink was a little weak. I'd definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I'm getting pretty close to not setting foot in here again.  Here's why:
As a regular, I not only go there for the food, but because of the people.  I have known these servers and bartenders for years, right up until they get shopped and fired.  That's right folks, my meals are usually almost ALWAYS ruined by some idiot shopping a beloved server or bartender of mine and I have to sit there and listen to Joe Shmo ask moronic questions like (no joke) \"can my daughter have a beer?  She's sixteen....what's the legal age to consume alcohol?\"  Now as a former secret shopper myself for a LARGE company, here's a few words of advice, train your shoppers, a want ad in the newspaper is ridiculous.  If you care THAT much about customer service, let your customers be your shoppers, because I can spot these idiots when they walk in, and most of them LOVE the idea of judging a young person and making them sweat for their job.  Shame on you.  Secondly as a loyal customer, the way I was treated by your shoddy excuse of management when having an allergic reaction to peanuts in your dessert was appalling.  Here's my assessment as a former shopper:

1.) When I asked the wait staff if the chocolate dessert had peanuts in it, they seemed sure it did not, but nobody could be sure because it wasn't printed on the menu.  Upon having two bites of the dessert my mouth immediately swelled up and I had an allergic reaction.  Ciara and Toni were very concerned and attentive, offering water and even a concoction to help me purge the food if needed.  They both kept a watchful eye on me while making sure to not neglect other patrons.
2.) I asked to speak to a manager to merely suggest for the second time (this happened before with their banana dessert) that as an establishment, they should protect themselves by listing peanut ingredients on the menu.  The manager replied that usually when someone has an allergy they tell the server and then the server tells the kitchen, thus making me the customer feel like it was a failure on my part to notify and announce my allergy to the entire restaurant upon my arrival.  Sitting there astounded, I asked if I was indeed hearing what I was hearing, and she glossed over it, thanked me for the feedback, said they were going to reprint their menus at some point, offered to call \"someone\"I'm assuming an ambulance, and pat me on the back and left.  Really?

So here's the deal, the food is good, the servers and bartenders are the best.  Pretty much everyday they work in fear of losing their job, and I can't support that.  They remember what you drink, how you like your food prepared, your name, and that's not something you get in chain restaurants, but the regulars, the ones who you could count on to support the place, they've slowly disappeared, and I'm headed that way myself.  Unless you've been sitting at your spot, enjoying your meal only to have it RUINED by some jerk shopping your friend and one of many favorite bartenders or servers, you don't know what sick is.  Getting a job in today's economy is difficult enough, but these people treat the mostly 20 something employees like slave  workers who are fortunate to be breathing the bobby q air.  I can't fathom going in to work everyday wondering if it's my last.  Finally, when a regular has a concern like PUT PEANUTS ON YOUR MENU, it's not just for the patrons benefit, but your own, and you failed to see that, instead you shrugged me off and couldn't get out of my presence fast enough; I know when I'm being patronized, don't forget, I can shop you too, and you failed big time, as in you'd be fired.  Good customer service is what Pita Jungle did where they asked me for my phone number or email address to discuss further (turned out to be pine nuts that were most likely cross contaminated).

So in conclusion, when you look around and wonder where all the regular money was that you could always count on coming in every dY at the same time, it's probably at the Black Angus, one of your former regulars is now a regular there, people can go there and grab some food and a drink or two without witnessing the torture you inflict on you're employees.  Shame on you."}
{"text":"I have been to Bobby Q a couple of times now and LOVE this place.
If you have a date that you need to impress and still fill your carnivorous desires, this is the place!  It's all good: ribs, juicy brisket, smoky chicken, can't go wrong here. 

The atmosphere is awesome at Bobby Q's the outside is Caribbean and the inside classy. The only improvement I would like to see would be the lunch menu on the weekends."}
{"text":"Bobby Q is an amazing BBQ joint. Highly recommend it! The ambience is warm and fun. The service was exceptional. It was my first time and the waitress was very well versed about the food and how it is prepared. She made great recommendations. The cornbread was so good and rib meat slip off the bone. Sides were okay. I enjoyed the grilled veggies, but the Mac n Cheese not my favorite. Dessert, Banana pie, is a must! We were approached several times by two managers and our waitress definitely checked in a few times. It was very nice, but our conversations were interrupted several times throughout the evening. Less interruptions ideal. If I am ever back in Phoenix, AZ I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! We started with the Q Rolls which were delicious! The brisket was so tender and flavorful! I got the pulled pork sandwich which was fantastic. It was cooked to perfection! My boyfriend got the ribs and catfish combo. The ribs were out of this world, the best either of us has ever had! You didn't even need a fork or knife to get the meat off, it was literally falling off the bone. So yummy! 

We're from Chicago but we will make a trip to Phoenix whenever possible just to eat at Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good. Brisket was fresh and tender .  I thought their prices were very fair. The appetizers are very good the Cole Slaw and macaroni and cheese was good. Service was great . I wasn't that  impressed with the doughnuts but it won't stop me from going back"}
{"text":"The ribs and brisket were both fabulous fall off the bone, Q-rolls and cornbread were great, highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"Awesome. 

I haven't had decent barbecue in, well maybe years. The service was fantastic. Immediately seated, our waiter was attentive but not smothering, always coming back for refills. 

The complementary cornbread is such a wonderful treat. While not the best cornbread I've ever had it certainly was welcome after a long day. It was light and crumbly and delightful.

I decided to go all out and order a full rack of baby back ribs. Even though my waiter forgot to give me a steak knife I didn't really need it. Now I realize that falling off the ribs does not make good barbecue, but it certainly helps. These were tender and succulent, the sauce was not slopped on and complimented the taste of the meat. 

I got sides of mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. The potatoes were average, nothing special. The mac was buttery and cheesy as it should be. 

It made a wonderful lunch the next day. The next time I feel like treating myself I'll make my way up here again."}
{"text":"The bbq here is pretty good, but that has been documented well by others. My favorite thing on the menu is actually the fried chicken. It's a HUGE boneless breast that is breaded in a yummy coating and although it is fried, it is not a big greasy blob. It comes with two sides, but they suggest one be the mashed potatoes and gravy. The mash is really quite good. There is a hint of spice in there that is unexpected and nice.  My only gripe is that they serve the gravy on top of the fried chicken and I have never understood why you would drench something crispy in anything that is going to eventually turn everything to a gooey mess.  The flavor is great. Just put it on the side.

The free donuts are a nice touch, but nothing special, so save the calories and get the banana pie/pudding thing. The crust is made of crushed nuts, which is then topped with a substantial layer of bannana pudding. All of this is then topped with carmelized bananas and drizzled in carmel. YUMMO!!

And if you like their macaroni and cheese (which IMHO) is heavenly cheesy goodness, skip it as a side and order a quart to go instead.  You will get about 8 to 10 side servings for around $6.50 and that is a HUGE savings over the sides price.

Put your walking shoes on for the hike you will need to burn off the calories and just know going in that you have to through your diet out the window for one good meal."}
{"text":"I am an Arizona native and at first missed Bobby McGhee's but who knew the owners were such magicians with BBQ (and this coming from someone who lived in the south for 13 years!).  The brisket spring rolls are a delight to the taste buds and the ribs are fall off the bone delicious.  The meat was not greasy at all and had just the perfect amount of seasoning as well as a small amount of sauce. Yep... true BBQ is about the meat not the sauce.  The cornbread has just the right amount of sweet, though my southern hubby was disappointed it was not hot water cornbread. 
This is most definitely not your chain BBQ restaurants that just hint at true quality product. Absolutely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Bobby Q st the end of girls' weekend, and I'm so glad we did!  Travis m, our server, was awesome! His recommendations were right on, and he was really friendly and attentive.

The food is amazing! I had the jumbo BBQ baked potato with beef brisket, and it was delicious. I almost couldn't eat the entire serving, but I did! The brisket was moist and tasty, perfectly done, three bbq sauces were available as well.

For dessert, we got some free hot cinnamon donuts to take home--so make sure to save a little room. The prices are great, too."}
{"text":"Spotted this gem from the 17 FWY. Just visiting Phoenix for a weekend, I turned to my boyfriend and said, \"We have to go there before we head back to LA.\" He was totally on board once I showed him the pics from Yelp. Banana Cake, Doughnuts, Meat. Yum!

We didn't even know until the day of that we would get a 10% discount for mentioning Yelp! Bobby Q rocks!

One Whole Hog Heaven and four refills of Arnold Palmer later, we were in Bobby Q Heaven. My God!!!

Check out the pic I uploaded with caption --
\"Feast your eyes on the Whole Hog Heaven\"
Yup. That's my boyfriend, the most perfect man for taking me here, and buying me the best BBQ I've ever had, ever. Period.

Service was perfect. Adam was extremely attentive. Great personality. He even brought me a cole slaw sample because I was inquiring about it, but didn't end up ordering it! Needless to say, we were so impressed that we left a 50% tip. Seriously, Bobby Q and Adam are that good.

Vibe is perfect. Decor is amazing. Indoor/Outdoor seating. Food is fantabulous. Service is impeccable. Oh, the best - when you pull into the parking lot, before you even get out of your car, you can smell the smokey meat goodness. All of their meat is smoked/cooked for 24 hours before hitting your mouth. That means that all the meat is fall off the bone perfection.

And the extra bonus - the moistiest corn bread before your meal and the sweetest cinnamon sugar doughnuts after your meal. What more could you ask for?!

I want a Bobby Q location in Los Angeles. In fact, why not put one in every city? This stuff definitely needs to be shared."}
{"text":"Above scale BBQ.  The atmosphere is more upscale than the typical cowboy BBQ restaurants.  This is refreshing.  Prices are very fair with extra large portions.  My wife and I easily share entres with food left to go.  Flavor is smokey in a good way.  Of course the meats are very tender from slow smoking.  The wait staff tends to be on the younger side, so may get terrific service or marginal.  Management and kitchen seem to be more consistent than the wait staff.  But, don't let this keep you from the restaurant, the food and atmosphere are tops."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ. The cornbread is served fresh and hot. Honestly best cornbread I've ever had. We ordered \"The Whole Pig\" and it was epically delicious. We split it between two but it's honestly enough for maybe 3-4. Very friendly and quick staff. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Best one I've tasted in Arizona yet. For the price and the quality of the food I would definitely recommend Bobby Q. The service was great! All the servers were friendly and welcoming. 
Last time I came I got the ribs, mash potatoes, frys, and mac and cheese. I was more than satisfied! 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Seriously awesome BBQ in a totally random place.  The ribs were unreal, seriously, fall off the bone, meaty deliciousness to the face.  Be prepared to wait for a little while before being seated, we came on a Tuesday night and had to wait for about 30 minutes, always a good sign that you're in for a treat.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Bobby Q's is the place to go if you'd like a very nice barbecue dinner. The baby back ribs, pulled pork, and beef brisket were all succulent and tender. The cornbread, which is served before the meal, was a favorite of mine. The end of the meal concluded with a bag of cinnamon sugar doughnuts . What could be better?! It was a great meal. 

Hog heaven , which is a meal on the menu, is suggested to feed 2 or 3 people. But this can easily feed 4, especially if
You have no large eaters. ON Sunday's , they serve a Similar meal for a lower cost . 

My family was looking for a nice sit-down meal that was not far from Grand Canyon University, so we were excited to find such a Nice restaurant within 10 minutes of the college.  The food, as well as the atmosphere, gets 5 stars. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Bobby Q. Was feeling kind of skeptical about a Phoenix bbq place right off the freeway, next to a Phoenix scuba diving academy. Immediately distracted by so many strange bbq scuba situations. Either way, turned out to be kitschy in a great, not overwhelming or mass produced way. Wood paneling, mirrored saloon doors, and roasting chickens on a spit. We were seated immediately and our server was very friendly/fast. Beer/cocktail selection was meh. Q rolls were really good. Spinach dip was ok, made better by garlic bread sticks. In my opinion the real shining star was the mystery bag the server dropped off when we paid. Oh look a cute doggie bag FILLED WITH FRESH HOME MADE CINNAMON SUGAR DONUTS. These were spontaneous drool level, manna from heaven level good. Next time I want the ribs and maybe 9 or ten bags of donuts."}
{"text":"From a former KC, KS resident...Killer BBQ, try the Q-Rolls, you won't be disappointed.  Baby back and beef ribs are also legit.  Two trips in the last month and I'd go back right now if it was closer"}
{"text":"Only 4 stars because its one of the first bbq places we tried in Phx ....and they did set  the bar relatively high. 

Q rolls with the chipotle dip was enough  to make me go back. Catfish poboy was decent ...the pulled pork sandwhich tho was everything to expect from pork smoked for 18 hrs.  

Had a chill waiter tommy2027, and was checked on by the manager who brought over fresh cornbread ...overall great first experience."}
{"text":"Review from a visit on 9/2/16, just getting around to it.  Found Bobby Q based on Yelp reviews.  We were in town to visit my son that just started at GCU.

As we walked up I was a little surprised at how dressed many of the people were.  They looked like they were going out clubbing.  Turns out, there is a night club/bar attached to the restaurant.  Seems many of the club goers had dinner then moved on to the club.  The club in no way ruins the dinner experience and you can never hear the music or even know the club is there.  The food was very good and the service was excellent.  We were a party of 9 and we were assigned 2 waiters.

If you are Gluten Free all of their sauces are GF and they have a GF menu.  Only bummer is that they don't have a GF version of their cornbread.  The meats are tasty, tender and juicy.  The sides are all generous portions and good.  All 9 people got different items and no one was disappointed.  For the non-meat eaters there was a good selection of seafood.  I will return on my next visit to AZ as good bbq is not always easy to find."}
{"text":"Yum.   This place is great.  Nice atmosphere.  Bar tender is very pleasant.  Tried the pulled pork.  Best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Wow! What a fabulous dining experience! We tried a large sampling of menu items (7 kinds of meats, 6 sides, etc.) and all were scrumptious! Large servings + reasonable prices + great service + FINGER-LICKIN' GOOD FOOD = one amazing dinner. You've got to try Bobby Q if you've never been - and you'll be hooked for sure."}
{"text":"The food here is spectacular... however it was eclipsed by our server Austin. He was so attentive and friendly. We enjoyed the prime rib and the sirloin ... both were cooked to perfection and very tasty. The sides complemented the steaks but the standout had to be the Mac & Cheese - simply incredible. We recommend the Iron Stone Merlot  off the wine list. We finished off dinner with the Sub Zero Banana Pudding , it's a great dessert without an overpowering  banana flavor. We highly recommend Bobby Qs and of you go ... ask for Austin."}
{"text":"I really liked it - and didn't get a chance to try anything more than the pork and a nibble of sausage as I was there for lunch and was kind of in a hurry.  The service was solid and everything I tasted was delicious... I just wanted a slightly bigger portion.  I realize they bring out free cornbread when you get there, and free tiny doughnuts when you leave (both are really good) - but you come there for MEAT!  I also realize it was a 'lunch portion' - but for the prices I wanted more bang for the buck.  The only side I tried was the mac n' cheese, and have nothing bad to say about that either.  I think the solution is to go for dinner and maybe try the sampler where I can leave satisfied.  I'll be back if I'm ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Good Good service Ribs were amazing  Mac n cheese was good great sides are sever Alicia was super sweet"}
{"text":"That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome. 5 stars. 

The smoked corn was a little Meh... it was oily like not butter oily... not a huge fan of the texture either. I like corn crunchy and it was not. 

Service was great. 

I did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing, but bugs have to eat too right? (still 5 stars lol)"}
{"text":"This is the go to spot for a nice quiet dinner inside or out, the meat is amazing and if you feel like breaking those dance shoes out they have two dance floors! Love going here definitely gotta try this place out at least once."}
{"text":"Let's start with the name. What a clever double entendre!BBQ and Bobby Q. Love it. 
First time here a few days ago and totally impressed. The staff is so friendly and courteous. Sadly this is a lost art. So I love it when you find restaurant staff really enjoying being good hosts. 
Now to the decor: love the rustic interior. Very warm and cozy. 
Last but not the least, the food. Well I can attest to the quality of the ribs and the brisket accompanied by the tasty sauce. Yessir!
Will surely come back for more and check out the other stuff on the menu. 
Keep it up y'all!"}
{"text":"We came here and ordered the Q roles. The Q roles were an appetizer, but  I am pretty sure that could work as an entre for one person. Our main dish was the 3 meat combo. We chose the string fries and mac and cheese as our side dishes. Baby back ribs, brisket and beef ribs were our meats. Everything was delicious! The portions were definitely bigger than we expected. And both my boyfriend and I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. The customer service was very friendly and the manager even came to greet us and make sure we were enjoying everything. We loved our first visit here & definitely recommend it to other people who like the Texas style barbecue."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ joint @ PHX!  Great menu selection (see menu here: http://bit.ly/5wWlwt). They have wonderful BBQ Combo platters. I usually get the Ribs and Pork. The sides are great as well. They've outdoor seating. Great place to have nice red meat and a beer at a fair price."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ spot in central Phoenix. I had the 2 meat combo with baked potato and Mac and cheese. The food was really good. I have had better BBQ but this spot definitely is worth coming back to. It can be a bit noisy so bring your loud voice with you. Food came out decently fast for being BBQ and the amount of ppl that were eating."}
{"text":"The food!! It was delicious. The service and atmosphere could have been awful and I still would have given a good review on the basis of the food alone. However, the atmosphere was inviting and simple with warm lights, wooden tables, and old-fashioned decor. Our waiter, Austin, was very attentive and outgoing. He checked in frequently and was able to make suggestions because of his knowledge of the food (he had worked in the kitchen previously). There is complimentary cornbread to start, which just melts in your mouth. Our food came out very quick and every single thing was just to die for. My favorite thing was the rotisserie chicken and my boyfriend loved the brisket. Complimentary mini-donuts are also given with the check-yummy! Overall, this was a great place to go for out anniversary. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious! The meat falls right off the bone. The whole hog heaven can easily feed 4 people and gives you good variety.  The Mac and cheese did not disappoint. Im not a fan of mac and cheese, but
I'm glad we tried it. a must try.

Service is really great. My nephew has food allergies and our server and manager explained to us which kid's meal would be good and not. They also made sure that his food was cooked separately to avoid cross contamination. Overall a good experience. BBQ heaven indeed.

Btw, they give you free cornbread, free heavenly dessert donuts and 10% off if you check in on yelp"}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 (I'm 100% satisfied)

Service: 5/5 (Staff super friendly)

Parking: 5/5 ( A lot of space available)

Atmosphere: 5/5 (Nice and cool)

Even water tastes different here. This is my first time to come and eat at this restaurant. And now I understand why this business spot got so many excellent and high reviews on Yelp. 

Going to a restaurant does not simply means putting your butt on the chairs and eating what ever they give you. It also means enjoying your meal and satisfying your taste. 

Bobby Q just has everything it need to be the best Phoenix steakhouse. The price is not too bad if I compare to what I enjoy when eating here. My friend and I ordered the Two Rib Combo which includes two sides. We want to share, so the staff put on two different plates for us. We finish our lunch with ice cream. We decided to pick Death by chocolate, but the guy recommend me to pick Miss Mcgee's Mud Pie. That was delicious.

We came there pretty early, only three tables have people. But when we left, they were all full. Such a popular and crowded business.

My dad is a steak lover, so next time I will bring my family here. I know he will love it."}
{"text":"Little hard to find off the freeway, but well worth it. Visited for the first time after a spring training game in Peoria. Cool bar, and excellent food and service! Had the Homemade fried chicken and gravey with two sides, delicious! Also had appetizers and few drinks and everything was great. Will be back every year."}
{"text":"I love the restaurant. The ambience and service here are outstanding. The food meets expectations but does not exceed them. 
The brisket was almost on the dry side but good. The chicken was fantastic. The beef ribs were not very meaty but were sweet and tasty. 
My real complaint was the ribs. The baby back ribs were good, but a little overdone. I couldn't pick them up without them falling apart. Personally, I think they should be firm enough to hold together when you cut them and pick them up. But if I give the bone a firm tug, it should come out. It's a fine line and easy to cross. Bobby Q crosses the line, but all in all it's a very good BBQ joint. Given the competition in Arizona, it's easy to see why they are so successful."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on the way home from a weekend getaway.  You can always smell the BBQ right off the highway and it literally draws you in.  I was surprised that the atmosphere was as fancy as it was (think dim lighting and cloth napkins).  Don't be scared it's not really a fancy place and the food is still very affordable.  
The service was stellar.  Honestly, I had forgotten what good service was like after moving to Arizona, and then I came here and was shocked.  The waiter was friendly and the manager came out and talked to us for a long time and even brought us some mac and cheese on the house!  Good service always equals a returning customer with me and I was impressed that they took the time to make you feel welcomed and happy. 
The mac and cheese was outstanding.  It was rich and creamy and the cheese had just enough flavor YUM!  The shoestring fries were also very tasty.  The meats here are very delicious.  They are slow cooked and tender as can be.
The barbeque itself was pretty good.  It is kind of a tangy sweet flavor that wasn't the best barbeque I've had, but still pretty tasty.
If you drive past this spot on the highway make sure you stop in and pick up some delicious food!"}
{"text":"I placed a huge to go order last Saturday. Being from the South, we have high expectations for BBQ. Bobby Q meets these expectations plus more! The service I received over the phone and when I picked up my order was superb. Justin went above and beyond. The food was excellent. The baby back ribs were falling apart tender and had a great flavor. The smokiness isn't overpowering and we enjoyed that. The pulled pork was some of the best we had. The chicken was wonderful and we really enjoyed the hot link sausage. All the sides were delicious as well as the cornbread. Dessert was very good also. Overall, we felt it was an excellent value for the quality of food and service. Thanks for not disappointing, Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"So I've traveled various states and up and down California, always looking for as good a bbq I had when I was in Austin (actually Driftwood) at Salt Lick Restaurant. I use that place as the baseline for the best bbq I have ever had. Well, Bobby Q went as close to that level as ANY place I have been to since. The ambiance when you walk in sets the mood for carnivorous meal you are about to encounter. I went with the 3 meal combo, St. Louis ribs, Beef ribs, and the coup de gras sliced beef brisket. The St Louis and Beef were the damn near the best I ever had. I typically ask for the sauce on the side, so I can taste the meat and carefully add the sauce on my own, but this time I forgot. Regardless, it was cooked perfectly and sauced just enough, so the meat was still the star of the plate. The meat came perfectly off the bone and with the sauce was amazing. Herein lies why they didnt get the 5th star. The sliced brisket, although tasty, lacked the nice smoke ring and was cooked a bit too long. Again, it was still delicious, but I couldnt give the 5th star because of that. Also, the mac n cheese, which they say is very popular, was starchy (mind you I dont mind cheese) but the that was lacking in the taste. I washed it down with West Coast IPA from tap so that was a plus as well! And of course, complimentary to the meal was cinnamon sugar mini donuts, 2 per customer that came out with the bill. This was my first foray there, but will definitely not be my last while my son is attending college in AZ. My hats off to this place, as I told that to our waitress that night, as well as the manager."}
{"text":"I try to have something different each time we go and I have not had anything I didn't like. This food is smoked perfectly and tastes amazing! My family tells each other about going here and it's an expectation when they visit. Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Over all the food was great. The lemonade was too sweet with more sugar on the rim. Not a big fan. You really can't taste the actual lemon. Sangria was delicious and services was great. And you get free mini donuts."}
{"text":"Went here for a meetup group event.   First off, I would like to say, if I was grading the cornbread, the mac and cheese and the mashed potato sides, I would give them a resounding five stars.   The service, I would give five stars as well.   It's the BBQ that I would give more like a two or three stars, hence, the three stars since that's probably what the place is known for.

There was probably about 20 of us.   We had two servers, which they were organized and kept things moving along.   Drinks came out in a timely fashion as well as the warm cornbread and butter, which I could have just made a meal from that!

I love pork ribs, as you can probably tell from my prior BBQ reviews.   We could either order a half or a full.   I figured, since I was filling up on the cornbread anyway, I could take most of it home and ordered the full rack.   I asked which was leaner, which our server stated it was the baby back.   I don't want all that pork fat.  

The ribs were, mehhhhh, okay.   A bit on the dry side; yes, falling off the bone, but it just lacked that bbq, smoky flavor that I am used to.   The sauce wasn't all that tantalizing either.

Now, the mac and cheese and the mashed taters, that was another thing.   I don't know what kind of cheese it is, but it was creamy and plenty of cheese.   The mashed taters had the skin, which I like, and was quite tasty as well.

I ordered a manhattan, which was good.   It's just that I think someone drank half of it before I got it since the glass was partially filled.   I was wondering what happened to the rest of it.

Would I return?   I would for everything except the Q.    I didn't care for the dryness of the meat and the blandness of the flavoring."}
{"text":"Whoa.  Fantastic BBQ.  Out of the numerous places I've been to, Texas and all, Bobby Q wins numero uno at this point.

It's really hard to find good brisket.  Bobby Q has GREAT brisket...the best I've ever had.  And yes, even better than the places I've been to in Texas.  The BBQ overall was better than what I've had in Texas.  

We ordered a 3 meat combo platter with ribs, sausage, and brisket.  Our sides included pecan cole slaw and mac n cheese.  The cole slaw wasn't very tasty or flavorful.  The mac n cheese was cheesy, creamy, and yum.  We also ordered a side of veggies to make us feel better about our meal.  Haha.  

It was busy but we were able to get a table right away.  Service was decent.  Parking gets a little packed but you'll find a space somewhere.  

 Oh, and at the end of the meal...you get fresh donuts sprinkled in cinnamon sugar FTW!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  (Yes, that's my Hunter Pence chant.)  

Bobby Q is doing everything right and I'm so glad I got to try it.  Gives me another reason to come back and visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!

Love the service and the food. Nice atmosphere as well.
the corn bread has to be my favorite thing! best pulled pork sandwiches.. MMM!
the manager always intrudeces her/him (theres 2) and make us feel welcomened."}
{"text":"The beef brisket is so good and tender
The pulled chicken is also really good.


I had the catfish last time and it was ok, I would stick to the Bbq. 

The cornbread is the bomb and the donuts are a great dessert. 

I love the potato salad, mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.....I really battled over scoring this fine establishment. So let me break it down:

Setting: 5 stars-Great decor, lots of televisions, dim lighting, and just a comfortable feel.

Staff:  5 stars- Our waiter was awesome. I am very frustrated with myself for not remembering his name. He checked on us often and really took care of my party of 8. The manager also walked by and checked on us. Class act all the way around. 

Food: 4.5 stars- The food was great. The sides (French fries, potato salad, Cole slaw, Mac and cheese) were awesome. Each side could not have been any better. As for the meat, it too was very good. The problem I have is I compare everything now to the barbecue spot Little Miss Barbecue.  The meat (pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and ribeye) was moist and flavorful. Better then Little Miss? No, but it was darn good. I really would love to give the meat a five but that would not be fair to Little Miss. For dessert, we knocked out the bread pudding and their complimentary mini donuts. The bread pudding was not on their menu but it needs to be. It needs to be their go to dessert. It was amazing!!!!! Loved it!!! LOVED IT!!! The donuts were so fresh and a real treat.

Bobby Q's is legit for sure. I would and will stop by again. I really wish I could give it 4.5 stars. What a nice meal/time."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the quality of the food here. I haven't had a bad experience yet. The customer service is just as good. Thank you."}
{"text":"I dunno if this is THE BEST BBQ i've EVER had.... but it is definitely the best i've had in phoenix! 

they offer this family special - the whole hog heaven, which is st louis style ribs, bbq pork, bbq beef brisket, and bbq chicken, plus 2 sides, for around $30, which feeds 2-3 people. so we ordered one of these, plus a 3 meat combo (2 orders of baby back ribs + more bbq beef brisket). oh my word. so much meat! tasty, glorious, juicy, succulent meat! i heartily recommend the st louis ribs over the baby backs, bc they were cooked SO tender and were so nice and meaty. 

it was alllllllll good! and their spicy bbq sauce? love it! for sides, we tried the grilled corn, mashed potatoes, and shoestring fries. i'd say forget the fries, but definitely get some of that corn! and the cornbread.... well. it was pretty good, but i did expect better. 

i saved some room for dessert, and we tried the apple griddle cake. it was like.... cooked apples on top of a custard-like crust. we were expecting it to be more of an apple pie type deal, so it was slightly disappointing. and it also wasn't awesome, but it was still good. i adore how they give you a cute little bag of hot, fresh donuts! they were delish, and still tasty the next morning. 

a little deals heads up - if you go on sundays, the whole hog heaven meal is a bit cheaper. can't remember the exact numbers since i didn't pick up the tab, but it's a screamin' deal!"}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend in for lunch/happy hour and we were lucky enough to get sat with Jay at the bar. I've been in the service industry for years and generally loathe dining out because I'm usually critiquing instead of enjoying. This instance was the exact opposite. I instantly felt at home and completely cared for thanks to Jay. His menu/cocktail knowledge was exceptional and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We'll definitely be back, thank you for an awesome experience!!!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork was absolutely wonderful.  It was delicious.  I had the mac 'n' cheese and ranch beans with it.  The mac 'n' cheese was good but heavy.  I thought the ranch beans were going to be like baked beans but they weren't.  They weren't sweet like baked beans; they had a thinner red sauce on them and the flavor didn't work for me.

The cornbread was ok.  The pieces looked like muffin tops.  It was good, but I've had better.  

We went here for dinner at 7:30 on a Thursday.  It was loud and really crowded - too loud to comfortably converse with the two people I was dining with."}
{"text":"Our family was in Phoenix for Wrestlemania 26 and asked people around town where to get some good BBQ.  The general consensus was \" Bobby Q\".  At first I thought it was an accent or they were talking funny repeating BBQ back to me, lol. After a few chuckles we decided to give it a try and stopped if for dinner.  WOW... what a treat.  They were crazy busy and had us seated with in 20 minutes.  We ordered some ribs which were awesome.  The mack n' cheese was some of the best I've ever had. The corn bread was was the high lite of this meal in my opinion, moist and full of flavor.   Service was top notch and I'm so glad our family got a chance to eat here while on vacation. After our meal we were treated to a little dogie bag of freshly made cinnamon and sugar dough nuts they make by the front door as you wait to be seated! If I close my eyes I can still smell them!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints! My favorite place for a great dinner and worth the little extra cost; there is always another meal left for the next night."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ joint.  Wife and I split a whole hog heaven and it was way more than we could handle.  Got chicken, brisket, baby back and St. Louis ribs.  Ribs were great, meat falling off the bone.  I thought the brisket was a bit dry; wife thought it was moist and delicious.  Go figure...  The chicken was  chicken, not much to say about it. I gotta say though, the cornbread was spectacular - I could've eaten a whole basket.

I normally don't say much about service, but this place is on top of its game. Happy staff were popping out of the woodworks asking if we're satisfied or need anything else.  Check-ins were frequent but not  annoying.  Atmosphere is nice too. It was busy on a Friday night so make a reservation."}
{"text":"We've been to Bobby Q's many times and it's always been a great experience. Everything we've eaten here has been delicious, the services is exceptional, the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is great too. My husband loves the Baby Back ribs and usually sticks to that. But I like try something different each time. On our most recent visit I had a Ribeye steak and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful. Our server, Lindsey, was very friendly, efficient, and accommodated all of our special requests. Our food was served quickly and exactly as ordered. We like to take our family and friend's to Bobby Q's too, because we know there will be something on the menu to please everyone. Bobby Q's is one of our favorite places for dining out."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, family friendly environment, and delicious BBQ. Wish we lived closer to this gem!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing!  They switched to Coke products though, so I'm trying not to hold that against them!  Great food, awesome service!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come to Bobby q's it's always super busy! The location is a little hard to find but its off Dunlap and the i17. They have good cocktails drinks that they have prepared for you and I love shock top on draft and they offered it. Very good for ribs, steaks, and all there sides! If you haven't been I definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ me or my family had. The meat is so tender it melts. Cameron our server is really good and knows his job. Desert and drinks are great! Sad is so far from home."}
{"text":"Bobby Qs was recommended by my realtor, a local resident who suggested I try it. I had to come by myself since I am visiting the Phoenix area and was on my own for dinner tonight. Since it happens to be just across the highway from my hotel I decided to try it.

I sat in the bar and the very friendly and outgoing bartender took my order for the combo rib plate which came as a half rack of baby backs and a half rack of Saint Louis ribs.  They were out of the beef ribs which I would have ordered over the baby backs which feel are over rated.

The ribs took less then 15 minutes from order to table. The plate was impressive and the ribs were excellent.Other then size of the bone I couldn't tell them apart.  For me general rule for ribs is that if they are \"falling off the bone\" they are over cooked. That was the case here, but the ribs were so tasty I was able to overlook that. They have two choices of BBQ sauce, spicy and mild...they were both similar in flavor with the spicy having a little more kick.  Overall the meal was excellent...I wish I had someone to enjoy it with. All in all 5 stars for food, service and atmosphere.  Next time I am going to try the smoked prime rib...sounds interesting."}
{"text":"I LOVE the mac and cheese, the ribs, and the queso garlic bread appetizer is amazing as well. Fun atmosphere and have been here 5 times at least without a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"Why oh why have I waited so long to come here on a Friday night? You get a a fabulous little mini buffet that has tri tip, nachos, shrimp, cheese, and its free? Oh and the drink prices? Two very strong drinks, $4.50 each? What? Are you kidding me? Tons of people which makes for great people watching, great food, good happy hour prices? Again why did I wait so long? Oh I will be back. That is for certain."}
{"text":"Amazing service from the moment I walked in until I walked out. The setting and environment is very comfortable and inviting.  The food... is above an \"ok\" but it is over priced. On a scale of 1 to 10... overall a generous 7 (because of the selection). Ranch beans are delicious but could be served hotter. The corn bread is yummy and moist. The potato salad is creamy and very flavorful (you better like dill). The brisket was moist and tender but the sauce was a little bland for me (I like more heat). The baby back ribs were over cooked. In fact, I didn't like the ribs.

In summary, the price is almost worth it for the service and setting but let's be honest... I can't eat either of those.  $31 for a 2 meat combo and a beer."}
{"text":"This is now our \"go-to\" place for company lunches. The food is amazing, I highly recommend the beef brisket and if you love vegies get a double order of the gilled vegies. 

I seem to spend a lot less at Bobby Qs compare to Famous Daves and the atmosphere is far better at Bobby Qs.

Better service, better food in a nicer restaurant for less."}
{"text":"Q rolls excellent. Cornbread is sweet and good.  Ordered the family dinner pack.  Everything tasty. Great lemonade too."}
{"text":"Yep, when the kids are happy, everyone is happy. 

My 7 year old loved this place, actually all of us loved this place. 

It has ambiance, and a great menu... 

So, here it is: play by play:

5 stars for parking 
5 stars for wait time, busy dinner time and we were seated immediatley 
5 stars for menu options 
5 stars for speed of food coming out
5 stars for everythingggg"}
{"text":"The brisk was tender and juicy. The cornbread was sweet and the baked potato was cooked perfectly. The service from Sara Hendricks was stellar. By far, the best bbq joint I have been to in a long time."}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  Our server was very nice and attentive, even though she was busy with a large party in the next table.  The food was aces as well, we enjoyed the ribs, the brisket and the sausage.  We had potato salad with the corn and the beans as sides, and you can tell how fresh everything tasted.  Definitely a keeper...we had so much left over."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. The food was great. The pulled pork was awesome and the mashed potatoes great. My kids got the barbecue chicken and they both loved it. Will definitely go back for more"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Party of 4 ordered pretty much one of everything and it was all incredible. We eat at a lot of BBQ places around the US - one wouldn't expect one this good in Arizona. 

Portions are big. Lots of wonderful options. Highly recommend it 

The only weird part is the club. We went on a Thursday night - late. At 10pm - a club opens up next door. Not really our scene. I've never seen a BBQ place transform into a night club."}
{"text":"The Happy Hour is a ton of fun. It's best to reserve a table if you come. The food is good! The music and dancing is for all ages. You must be 21 for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Oh no! I caught the meat sweats again from Bobby Q! That bastard! 

I can't claim I'm an expert in BBQ, however I think I hold my own and Bobby Q is damn good. We enjoyed a few happy hour beers for $3 to $5 depending on the beer. Then we did it, we went with the Whole Hog ($36). It included 4 types of meat and 3 sides. The highlights were the St. Louis ribs, the beef brisket, mac n cheese and the cole slaw. Way too much food for two, but my company was paying so let the sweats begin! 

Service was friendly and the decor was inviting. The back room area, or I guess the club, was a bit sketchy but what club isn't at 5PM. Maybe that's where you find the cure for those sweats!"}
{"text":"Back in Phoenix with my wife and since I had to go to PF changs with her, I brought her to Bobby Q for a bbq dinner last night.  We ordered the whole hog, ribs. Pulled pork, brisket, 3 sides.  Great tasting and the services was exceptional as well as the food.  We shared the whole hog dish, and brought more home as leftover than we were able to eat.  Moving to Phoenix in a few months and this will be our bbq joint."}
{"text":"Awesome Barbeque. The chicken was so tender. The grilled vegetable were cooked perfectly. The corn was served off the husk and was so sweet. But the best part was Carmella. She made me feel like I was in own living room eating an perfect dinner. Ask for her she'll make your night."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  This does not do bbq justice.  bbq should be at a no-frills joint with limited service, a clear view of the smoker, and paper towels everywhere.  this looks more like a chili's.

Ordered the ribs and tasted mostly the sauce.  Which is okay sauce, but not the main draw when you order ribs.

Also the service was pretty mediocre to unprofessional."}
{"text":"Medium Rare steak cooked to perfection. Fabulous mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese. I have never had a bad meal here, always exceeds my expectations in quality, taste, and service."}
{"text":"It was a rough day today and I needed comfort food.  There are takeout parking spots out front (yay, thank you!) so carry out was super easy.  There are few places where I'll shell out $25 for a meal (it was more like two very full meals!).  The carryout host was super friendly and I only waited a few minutes for my bbq.  

Delicious!!  THE MAC N CHEESE IS AWESOME!!  (I know there's Velveeta in there!)  It isn't some food-servicey lumpy, watery crap.  So creamy and just melted in my mouth.  Meat was tender and not covered with fat like other bbq places.  I have at least one more meal with my leftovers."}
{"text":"My blogger buddy and I were in Glendale for Spring Training and found ourselves sighing at the lack of original food places. Not that eating in strip malls is bad.. it's just bad.
Luckily, my friend yelped and found this place nearby. We sat ourselves at the bar.
The food was outstanding! Not only did we LOVE our food, we met a regular that was hilarious and had schtick with our bartender/waiter. She was very funny! Oh.. and that was some quick service indeed!


There is a nightclub attached to Bobby Q. My friend and I did venture on over to check it out, but it was definitely NOT our scene or music. Very Vegasy. So, maybe skip that.. unless you are 23 and like Vegas clubs.. Or are like us.. and blog about traveling and check out things we would not normally visit. Or - if you want to dance off your meal, maybe? No.. wait.. I don't think you should do that. The food is really fantastic and should get to stay cozily in your stomach until it's good and ready to part ways.

{"text":"We couldn't make it to Little Miss BBQ, so we went to the next best rated BBQ join in town: Bobby Q (ha ha - Arizonian and their puns). 

Among 5 girls, we ordered a family meal and an additional rack of ribs.
-Cornbread: buttery and delicious, but save your appetite!
-Meat: enjoyed the baby back ribs over the st. louis; for both types of ribs, the meat falls off the bone; didn't enjoy the pulled pork or beef brisket 
-Sides: recommend the cole slaw and mac & cheese; potato salad is decent. 
-BBQ sauce: enjoyed the spicy BBQ sauce and used lots of it; regular sauce is too sweet.
-Complimentary donuts: just fried dough - nice gesture, but we passed on it. 

Bobby Q was super affordable for a hearty, calorie-heavy meal. Good service, ample seating and delicious BBQ."}
{"text":"Service is top notch, the food is incredible and their happy hours just ROCKS! if you want a fun place with a well themed atmosphere and great food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Waitress was excellent. She forgot our appetizer but we were glad later because we had so much food. Great strawberry lemonade.  We got the whole hog so we could try multiple things. Had enough leftovers for dinner (we were there for lunch). Great mac and cheese. Loved the ribs even though I usually never eat those. Brisket was excellent. Chicken was good too. Loved the spicy sauce. Great cornbread. We live out of state but if we come back to az we will probably drop by again."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this Place! Great food, great service and awesome price. Paid less than $150 for 6 people and we got the yelp discount. My father and fiance both got the  Ribeye and the rest of us ordered their Sunday Meal Deals, which was so much food. I loved their cornbread and their roasted corn side dish is a must try item.  I will go back next time in phoenix!"}
{"text":"I'd definitely recommend making a reservation, as this place is always packed! The food and customer service here are consistently amazing though, and well worth the few seconds it takes to call ahead. It's a date night treat that we always look forward to!"}
{"text":"Building looked interesting off the highway and reviews where mostly positive so we gave them a try.  As we walked up the aroma of bbq filled the air and knew we where in for something good.  Our waiter was nice answered all our questions gave us some recommendations.  I had the beef ribs and they where done great and tasted just as good as they looked.  I will advise the sides are big potions.  During our meal we talked with a lovely lady who worked there and gave us the history of the restaurant and noticed I hadn't ordered the the macaroni as a side and brought me one because it was house specialty.  Dam! it tasted great.  I would recommend saving room because you get doughnuts at the end of the meal that are done in house.   

Overall a good meal and would co"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant the food was outstanding, service was fantastic. I have been there several times and would definitely recommend it to anyone. Great place to take that special someone to or Celebration get togethers. I Will absolutely be back. Don't forget your bag of donuts before you leave.. If you don't want them I will take them."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and got 10% off.  It was fantastic.
Had the brisket and pulled chicken.  The brisket was good, but the pulled bar-b-q chicken was out of this world.  Every meal comes with skillet cornbread that was delicious.
For sides we had the baked beans and mac & cheese.  Both were excellent.
The incredibly sweat tea (I suggest getting it half & half) was awesome.
There were plenty of wait staff on hand even though it was an unusually busy Sunday.  They were all friendly, attentive, and attractive."}

{"text":"Service from the bartender and server was outstanding.  I've given an extra star for the service.

Yelp reservations worked like a champ and the server did honest the Yelp check in discount.  (She forgot to add it the first time I asked about it - not the end of the world.)

Ordered the Whole Hog Heaven.  All in a good value for two peeps.  Ribs were good as well as the pulled pork.  The brisket?  The brisket was a consistency that I have never experienced.  It was a bit like the consistency of mashed potato.  As a WSM owner, I've made my fair share of brisket and pulled pork.  I've never turned out a spongy brisket.

Ribs were fall off the bone which is all about marketing.  For fellow BBQ fans, we know that this means over cooked.  

Perhaps it was just an off night for the brisket?  All in I would go again."}
{"text":"All around amazing restaurant! I have seen this restaurant on a MUST try in a list somewhere but forgot the name. So I decided to enlist Yelp for help when I was in the Arizona area for Spring Training this year. What strike me was the 1300+ yelp reviews and the 4.5 stars rating. I knew I had to bookmark this. Reservation was easy as I did it on open table (4:30PM on a Monday).

My bf and I arrived earlier and sat at the bar. That's when I learned the hard way that Arizona has a law that prohibits selling alcohol to anyone with a vertical ID, even though they might passed the age of 21. (Yes, I'll be renewing my license this month as it expires next month). Oh well...

The full party arrived and we were led to a table for 6 in the back. We were promptly greeted by our server, Riley. He made us feel welcomed with his friendly attitude and provided us with a great recommendation for appetizer, the Q-roll! Everyone enjoyed it and it set a good note for the rest of the evening.

All the \"adults\" except me got the Bobby Q Amber Ale that went really well with the BBQ, while I got the frozen strawberry lemonade. It was delicious! They served us complimentary circular shaped cornbread before our main course, that was really good too. This is coming from someone that doesn't blink twice for cornbread. Then our order of the Whole Hog Heaven and a rack of the St. Louis Style Ribs came. That was the perfect amount for our group of 6 adults. We only had 2 ribs left and everyone was stuffed! To top off the amazing meal, our server gave us a bag of homemade cinnamon sugar donuts to take home. Overall, I was so glad my choice for dinner was a success!

Parking: A big private lot. There are spaces reserved for to-go orders.

Atmosphere: Outdoor patio, bar and dimly lit indoor seating. 

Good for: Dates (not really for first dates unless you don't mind eating BBQ), catching up with friends, small and big groups (family, friends, celebration, birthdays, etc.)

Service: Super friendly and accommodating. Right when I entered, the hostess was smiling and ready to help. Our server was awesome!

Food: Amazing. Don't even need a knife, it just melts off the bone! Whole Hog Heaven for groups of 4! Try the Amber Ale or the frozen strawberry lemonade.

Apparently, they'll turn into a nightclub on St. Patrick's Day. I'll definitely be back if I'm back in this area! :)"}
{"text":"First visit today, it's 50 minutes from home but we were in the area and went on a recommendation, so glad we stopped.

Absolutely phenomenal pulled pork sandwich, best I have ever had to date, bar none. Really good baked potato, excellent service, great ambiance, free corn bread that was also pretty good.
At the end of the meal the waitress brought us a little bag of tiny cinnamon donuts that were made just seconds before she brought them to us, scrumptious.

I was also given a sample of the brisket, it was really good too.

Look out Joes BBQ!!! (And I love Joe's) When Bobby Q's opens this fall at Stapley and I-60 you are gonna take a hit.

Given the opportunity, we will revisit Bobby Q's when We're on that side of town.

(Kudos to our very pregnant and excellent waitress today, 15% tip to her and 15% tip to the baby. My wife just had her first Chemo treatment for breast cancer and is rapidly losing her hair, the great food and service really cheered her up today and she really needed that. Thank you!!!)"}
{"text":"I've been to this bbq place twice now. Every visit has been an excellent experience. 

Place:  Both indoor and outdoor dining area are clean, well lit and kept cool. Menu was easy to read properly organized. Restrooms looked and smelled clean. 

Service: Received by staff with a smile. Leanne (our server) explained the menu and informed us that they smoke their meat low and slow. She always checked on our food and asked us if we needed anything else. We asked for a different sauce every time she visited our table and she provided us options every time. Manager visited our table to check on the sevice and food. I appreciate it when staff makes sure we are enjoying our visit. 

Food: Exceptional bbq!!! Prime brisket was juicy and tasty. Baby back ribs were very tender and falls off the bone but still has that chewy texture that releases more flavor. Sausage is sweet and garlicy. A perfect pair for something starchy like mashed potato or rice. Beef ribs are tender and the fat around it is full of smoky goodness. Corn bread is a sweet and salty goodness. Want a great appetizer, try the Q-rolls.

I'll be back. This will be my go to BBQ in AZ."}
{"text":"Saw the high reviews on Yelp for this place and had to check it out. Went with pick up this time and I got the two meat dinner plate. Ribs and brisket with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The best of the two in my opinion was be Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes were nothing spectacular. As far as the meat is concerned....Holy moly, this place has got to be one of the best bbq spots in Arizona. A bit pricey but worth it. The cornbread and little donuts are also amazing. I would come back here in a heartbeat! If you're in the mood for some good, finger licking bbq, this place is it! Also looks pretty lively inside on the weekends, check this place out if you're in the area, it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. I love it. There is no way anyone can eat all of this food in one setting. I'm completely speechless. Everything I ate was delicious even the donuts that they give you at the end of the meal. 

Ashlen is an excellent waitress! Extremely friendly and knows the menu well. I will definitely return, but the next time I'll make sure I have on my fat girl pants."}
{"text":"If it's your fist visit, try a combo platter. Such as the beef brisket, sliced pork and St. Louis ribs. The brisket is especially tender, juicy and flavorful. The ribs are also very good. 

The sides at Bobby Q are also good-sized and tasty. The beans and mac 'n cheese are especially good. 

One final note: after you pay your bill, you're presented with a \"Thank-Q\" brown bag with fresh-baked cake donuts. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ! Staff are so helpful & friendly. The pulled pork platter was excellent. Nice touch giving you a little bag of hot donuts when you leave."}
{"text":"What a great day for lunch. This place is on point. From the corn bread to the little doughnuts out the door. Wow they know ribs, pulled pork, and steaks. Even the Mac and cheese was top notch. Loaded baked was over the top also.  Simply a most go.  The server"}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends after reading the reviews and I was not disappointed.  My ribeye steak was well-seasoned and cooked perfectly.  My friend ordered the St. Louis and baby back ribs and both were fall-off-the-bone tender.  The side dishes were plentiful and the corn bread was moist and delicious.  The complimentary donuts were warm and a perfect finish to an awesome meal.  Better than Lucille's in California."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to come with friends and have a great cocktail and great barbeque at the same time. There's a reason why everyone should check this place out at least once in their lifetime. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. If I return to Arizona I will definitely bring more friends here with me!"}
{"text":"I'm certainly jaded by the variety of outstanding BBQ joints in Texas, so my visit to Bobby Q just wan't mind blowing.

In and of itself, Bobby Q has fine, workaday BBQ. The ribs are fall-of-the-bone moist, but almost entirely lacking in flavor save for whatever sauce you slather them in. No smokiness, no meatiness, just sauce. 

The mac-and-cheese is average, not good, not bad, and the coleslaw is mayo based, which I hate. Fortunately it's priced right, heck, it's downright cheap for decent BBQ, and our server was awesome. 

Not a bad BBQ spot by any stretch of the imagination."}
{"text":"Nice place and everyone's very friendly. I sat at the bar and has a drink and menu in front of me within the minute.  Ordered the lunch bbq brisket special. The bartender recommended the mac and cheese as a side.  Within a few minutes cornbread came out and my food a minute or two behind.  The brisket was okay and the BBQ sauce was good.  The bartender asked if I wanted more sauce and brought me the spicy as per my request.  Sauce was good but no where near spicy.  The mac and cheese was extremely good and the cornbread has a good not overly sweet flavor.  I would give 4.5 stars based on the brisket bland taste."}
{"text":"Great food   I had the smoked prime rib and my pop and jean had the baby back ribs.   The ribs were fall off the bone tender.   Prime rib was fantastic.  2 thumb up for this place"}
{"text":"45 Minutes to get there from the Gilbert area and it was worth it! Will I come again? Of course! I don't normally give 5 stars but when I do, you better believe it means something.

Greeted right away, sat right away.. Didn't even wait a minute! Good timing! 
Waiter: Riley - Great person -great customer service! Suggested, educated and was always checking up on us to see how things were. 20+% tip well earned.
Food: Outstanding. The meat literally fell off my fork it was extremely tender and flavorful. Cornbread was to die for. Got a desert: \"Death by Chocolate\" - Oh Em Gee! Everything was just good! 
Inside: Atmosphere was good.Would be a great place to bring a big party of XX over!

Thank you for a great birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Bobby Q's. I have had catering from here before many times and it's always delicious but this was my first time at restaurant. The restaurant is a little hidden off the free way but it's very pretty inside and has a big lot light up patio that is pretty at night time.

Food was super good, service was great, and a very  modern/fun atmosphere. This would be a great place for date night, family dinner, and even late night drinks. They serve cornbread to start which is delicious and then end the meal with complimentary fresh cinnamon sugar donuts with your bill. I got the loaded BBQ brisket baked potatoe which was very good and large portion. It came with a side of the mac n cheese which was the best I have ever had. My fiancé got the ribs which he said were amazing and the meat just fell off the bone. They serve the meals with home made hot BBQ sauce which is delicious. 

Price is moderate to high depending on what you get. You could get a big platter to share with a few people for a good price. I will definitely be back and continue to use them for catering . Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went to BObby q for a birthday gathering recently. We were a party of 6. I was the only one who had been before. Everyone was impressed with the place. The service was outstanding. I appreciate the fact that we were really able to relax and our server paid attention to detail. Food was great. Will be back."}
{"text":"The hog heaven truly is a piece of heaven. I shared the plate with 3 others and we all left fully satisfied. The baby back ribs, while not fall-off-the-bone, were smothered in a deliciously sweet sauce and were by far my favorite. Overall, I loved being able to sample so many different types of meat and enjoyed everything I ate. Each table is also served complimentary corn bread, a great appetizer to kick off the all-American meal. Our server was wonderful as well and was highly helpful in answering all our questions and making recommendations."}
{"text":"Beast BBQ around!  Good food and good service.  We love sharing the variety BBQ platters."}
{"text":"The service here is refreshing.  The servers are friendly and not rushed, they hold a friendly conversation - not a canned \"are you celebrating something special tonight?\" Like a particular restaurant I frequent.  The food is prepared properly (steak done as requested) and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Great BBQ joint in Phoenix! Such a good experience!

This place seemed like it was in a random location/nothing around the area, but maybe that's just because it was dark out and we were just trying to find the restaurant. The parking lot is large to accommodate all the people they likely have every night.  

We were greeted and seated immediately. Inside the ambiance was pretty loud and fun. Lots of space and seating, so groups are great here. When you walk in, you also might notice the doughnut making machine on the right. Try to save some room for those at the end! They're pretty good, and you get them complimentary! 

The service overall was good, fast and friendly. No complaints at all.

The food was really good as well! We got the Whole Hog Heaven. For two people, we really didn't come close to finishing this, so this might be good for three people, or four with smaller appetites. The meat was all delicious! I thought the brisket and pulled pork was a touch on the dry side, but I just threw some more sauce on and all was good. The cornbread is lite and fluffy, and the sides were great. Of all the meats, I actually thought the St Louis Ribs had the most flavor. And then, there was the doughnuts! Cinnamon Sugar I think. I don't think I have ever seen something like this given out complimentary before! What a nice touch!

Overall, great bbq spot in Phoenix! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We've gone to Bobby Q's several times over the past few years but this was the first time I was really compelled to write a review.  I went in for lunch today (on a Sunday) and much to my surprise they had a Sunday Feast special for $28.  It was 4 meats and 2 sides.  Phenomenal.  We had so much food left over we had to bring some home.  

The service was really good.  Our server was training someone as well and my experience at other restaurants is that usually slows things down.  Not today.  Our Iced Tea's were always full.  The only complaint I had was that I was trying to watch a football game on the TV and one of the servers turned the TV away from the dining room and towards the host station so they could see it.  They should be aware it's not about them - it's about their customer.  It wasn't a big deal so I wasn't going to say anything but thought I'd throw that in here in case the owner is reading.  

I still give it five stars today.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We recently took my son here for his birthday since he is a bbq fanatic! It was our first time and our server let us know a little about the place and the food which was nice. The corn bread was great and unlimited although we only needed one basket with our q rolls and meals. We ordered the pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad and mac n cheese on the side and my son had the ribs. I have to say I would probably get the ribs next time as well, the sandwich was ok but the sides we couldn't get enough of! 
By the end my son could barely fit his complimentary birthday dessert! Our server was absolutely wonderful and while we felt the food was pretty good the service we received was truly amazing and the best we've ever had. We will be coming here for many more special occasions :)"}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous with a lot of friendly staff!!! The food is amazing, the ribs are perfectly done and its a must !!!! I highly recommend this place !!!!"}
{"text":"Great bbq...another place to hit next time we are in town! Bar had seating inside and outside. Drinks were yummy. Don't do what I did and forget your \"free\" donuts."}
{"text":"It's been about 3 years since I've been here.  I am pleased to say it was just like coming home.  The staff were all very friendly and welcoming and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Wow. The lines scared me but the wait was worth it. Fantastic food. Every item outstanding. Service outstanding. Very few places serve ribs line this. The St. Louis ribs peeled of the bone.  The smoke was perfect."}
{"text":"Amazing. Everything about it. The people are extremely friendly & polite. Very \"At Home\" feeling. They serve very large portions for a reasonable price. And the food is just amazing. Everything we tried was delicious. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Bobby Q's is seriously my favorite restaurant in the country. I travel all over for work and sample local restaurants whenever I can. In over a decade of travel, I have not found a place I like more than Bobby Q's. For me, this is an absolute MUST stop every time I come to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Bobby Q is set back off the freeway in a slightly shady part of town, but don't let that deter you! The parking lot is covered in huge Eucalyptus trees so you can have shade on those hot summer days when you spend the next 1 to 2 hours of your life here haha. The BBQ here is delicious. The meat is moist and not overly wood tasting. I have had BBQ that had so much wood smoke cooked into it I was burping up the taste for the next 3 hours. Yuck. The potatoes are so good and the best part are the house made donuts in the brown baggies you get on your way out. He donuts are worth going here for alone yum! The staff is always attentive and it has a more upscale vibe. The outdoor area is shaded and has very tranquil water features so it is enjoyable to eat outside as well."}
{"text":"Whoa. If you have not eaten here, drop what you're doing and head over. Simply the best meat you have ever tasted. The brisket is to die for. If I were requesting a last meal - Bobby Q's beef brisket would be it. The baby back ribs are also superb. Chicken - it's good, but how good can chicken be.

The cornbread to start is simply fantastic, especially with the whipped butter so it soft and melts in nicely.

Also, the service is superb. Quick, friendly, helpful.

Simply fantastic. My favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was in the mood for prime rib today so I did a goggle search for places in our area. One of the listings that came up was Bobby Q. Based on the name and description as a BBQ restaurant, we were a bit unsure, but decided to trust the fantastic reviews. 
The service- Our server Amberlee (please forgive if misspelled) was pleasant, knowledgable about the menu items, and sooo attentive. Our iced teas never got lower than half full and she was always near if we needed anything. One of the managers even came to the table after we got our meal to ask how everything was. On a scale of 1-10 for service, I'd definitely give a 10. 

The food- In one word, WONDERFUL. Amberlee brought out corn muffins right after she took our order, which were not only moist but super tasty. When our prime rib arrived, mine was the 10oz end cut and his was the 14oz medium rare, we were astonished by the portions which were MASSIVE. The meal came with two choices of sides- mine were the loaded(bacon, cheese, sour cream, butter and chives) and roasted corn(corn on the cob roasted on the grill, then the kernels are shaved off and sautéed in butter) while my boyfriend had the mashed potatoes with the white gravy on the side as well as the roasted corn. Everything was perfect- the prime rib was seasoned just right with creamy horseradish and au jus and the sides complimented the meat perfectly. 
Once the plates had been cleared, Amberlee returned with a bag of complimentary doughnuts to go. We were so stuffed, but truly appreciated the gesture. The check was approximately $55 for both meals and two iced teas which wasn't bad for what we got. Not only great food, but fantastic service. We are planning on returning and telling all our friends how wonderful Bobby Q is!"}
{"text":"Good damn, that was a good eat and awesome service, too! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"First time visiting on a Sunday evening and this place is packed! We ordered the Hog Heaven family meal offered on Sunday only. Austin was our awesome, and kind server.  He told us a brief history of this place. We enjoyed our dinner here. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Every week our family orders take out from Bobby Q.  This is seriously the best bbq in Phoenix.  They have great prices & give you a ton of food.  One Christmas Eve we realized they forgot part of our order after we were already back home.  After calling the manager actually drove to our home & delivered the missing items.  They don't even deliver normally! That is what I call excellent customer service."}
{"text":"On a return trip from Sky Harbor, we stopped there, at our daughter's request, to eat.  That meal was the best BBQ meal ever.   We shared about 5 different meats (sausage, pork ribs, beef ribs and brisket, and chicken) with several sides, including mac and cheese and pecan cole slaw.  The beef ribs were OUTSTANDING!   Would definitely return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I were first timers, from the moment we walked in, everyone was so nice and welcoming. Our server(don't remember his name) gave us a little breakdown of the restaurants background and made some awesome suggestions for us. I have a Duck Duck Goose, strong yet sooo good! We ordered a Caesar salad with grilled chicken to start, that was delicious! And that was just the beginning of heaven! Def such a great experience all around. Such great customer service and delicious food! Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been twice since I last wrote a review and can find no excuse for not adding the 4th star.  I went for a Yelp UYE dinner and had a half rack of St Louis ribs with cole slaw and mac and cheese.  Last night I was there in a party of four and had the Smokehouse burger.  That is one of the best $10 burgers I have ever had.  The bun doesn't really hold up well so if you put it down you will end up finishing it with a fork.  Around the table there were ribs, steak and pulled pork.  It was my choice of restaurant and everybody loved their food!  One of our party ordered a Mojito and was told they don't make those there but other than that the drinks were fine.  I have now sampled 3 of their desserts, I didn't care much for the peach cobbler but the banana cream and the chocolate over dose were really good."}
{"text":"A coworker of mine highly recommended this place last year when I told him I was headed out to Tempe for spring training. I didn't get a chance to come last year but I made it a point to check it out this year. I was able to make a same day reservation for Saturday evening through the yelp app and I'm so glad I did because the wait was going to be about an hour otherwise. We waited less than 10 minutes to be seated. 

Our server Tiffany was great, we told her it was our first time so she took the time to give us history on the restaurant and she gave us her recommendations. The corn bread was so yummy and moist. My fiance and I shared the whole hog heaven, which comes with two meats, two ribs and 3 sides. For $40 not bad at all, we didn't finish our ribs and meat (there was a lot for two.) The sides could have been a little bigger, we devoured the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and flavorful. 

I usually prefer baby back ribs over the St. Louis but in this case we agreed the St. Louis were better. The pulled chicken was my favorite, it wasn't the typical chicken covered in bbq sauce. It had some other flavor I can't describe but it was amazing! We walked out of here stuffed, I almost needed to be carried out. The home made donuts at the end were a nice touch, even though I was full I couldn't stop eating them because they were so light/fluffy and bite size. Definitely took advantage of the 10% for checking in. Saved us 10 bucks, I'll take it!! I'll be back next year when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Went out on a date Friday night, again he picked the place, and it was a non-chain place, which scored him some points, but Bobby Q's gives the feeling a chain place, I have never been and I never knew about the Bobby McGee's that used to be there, I'm not from Arizona, and wasn't around during that time.   

After I went to Bobby Q's I actually looked at some the reviews from fellow yelpers and man I am sorry I missed out on the roasted corn, I am going to have to try that next time I go!  Our server's Melissa was a good, but she got tractable, like we made bets to see how long it would take before she came back to our table to check on us, it was about every 10 mins. Now don't get me wrong I love good service, but there is a difference between being pushy and good.

Like I have said before, Im a visual person and when I saw on the drink menu that yummy looking drink called Strawberry Qlada, I knew I had to get that, when it came to the table, it was just as beautiful in person, pinks, red, white, pineapple & cherry garish, it was a delish drink!

The round corn breads were a sweet surprise! I love me some cornbread! And with the whipped butter, what could be better, other than drowning them in hot bowl of chili! 

I ordered the 8oz center cut top sirloin with mac & cheese, ranch beans & mushrooms & onions for my steak!   I had asked Melissa if she liked the mac & cheese and she is it was the bestselling item on the menu, oh that's good, but that didn't answer my question lol but I wound up ordering them anyways, and they were good, but it wasn't great! Yes it's made with 5 different cheese, its creamy and it's like eating velveeta mac n cheese, not my fav but if that's your thing, then it's up your alley! The ranch beans were good, it was little peppery and sweet, which is a great combo for me!  The steak was the perfect amount for me! It was cooked to perfection, it was tender and tasty! The mushrooms and onions were sautéed just right, not too soft not to hard!   

Had I read reviews I would have known at the end of the meal they give us some sweet donuts! How cool is that! Any places that offers sweet little donuts is alright with me!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this - Yelp rarely lets me down - but I was disappointed overall.  

I give kudos to the host and waitress; both were very friendly, chatty, approachable.  My server gave me some background on the restaurant and made helpful suggestions.  I have high expectations when it comes to barbeque - juicy, lean brisket with a nice smoke ring, smoky chicken in a thick, tangy sauce, and the sides need to be out of this world.  

Based on a recommendation, I ordered the two meat combo, brisket and pulled rotisserie chicken.  For sides I got the corn and a baked potato (not a traditional barbeque joint side necessarily, but it sounded good).  The brisket was soft, chewy, fatty - way too much so for my taste.  I was enjoying the chicken until I encountered a bone - that was the end of the chicken for me.  The corn was very tasty, and oh yeah - the cornbread - that was the best part of the meal!   In my opinion, the baked potato had been pulled from the oven about fifteen minutes too soon - it had yet to reach that fluffy potato interior that is so desirable about baked potatoes.  

I sat outside; they have a lovely covered patio with various seating options and the ambiance was nice (if you don't mind birds flying around, very close to you).  Overall though, I can't get excited about this place and can't say that I would go back."}
{"text":"My wife, two children (12, 10) and I ordered the hog heaven.  Our food and service was absolutely awesome.  The kids each had a frozen lemonade which were delicious.  My wife had the raspberry sangria which she enjoyed immensely.  As far as sides are concerned, the slaw is just ok. The roasted corn was very good. The Mac and cheese is awesome.  I like a little more chew on my smoked ribs, but that is just me.  I would return to this restaurant without hesitation."}
{"text":"By far one of the greatest experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. I came here with my girlfriend during lunch. Our server Lexi was phenomenal, she was knowledgable about the menu and made great recommendations. She was very interactive and made sure I was satisfied. The manager Joe stopped by to say hi and ask about our food and experience. Definitely deserves 5 stars. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Meat literally fell off the baby back rib bone. No seriously, I'm talking about meat fell off the rib bones without any fork/knife effort.

And that brisket? Smoky, tender, soft, meaty & sweaty pieces of brisket chunk topped with Bobby's own BBQ sauce was ridiculous.

Starter: Q Rolls or bust. Think deep fried rolls with brisket inside, served with both BBQ and chipotle sauce.

To finish the meal, your server will come thank you with freshly made donuts. I wanted to be mad at them for making me fatter than ever. But I couldn't. I was all smiles with a ring of meat sweat glistening on my forehead.

Don't worry Bobby Q, you will forever be my Phoenix go-to restaurant. Can't wait to try your burger and steak soon. Until next time, I need to shed some lbs."}
{"text":"3 words: WHOLE HOG HEAVEN.
Can you say food coma. Saw this place while driving down Black Canyon freeway and I realized why it sounded so familiar. I saw it from an article I had screenshotted naming the 100 best restaurants in the country. So of course bf and I had to go. We decided on the whole hog heaven. 2 types of ribs, 2 types of meat, and 3 sides to share between us. Sooooo good. Meat was tender, flavor was delicious, and it came so quickly. Shoutout to our server Jason for being so friendly and attentive. Oh, and they give u free mini donuts in the end. Sold. Lol."}
{"text":"Had hubby's birthday dinner; this was one of our best dining experiences! Service was awesome, food was delicious (we had St. Louis ribs, three meat combo and baked cobbler) and ambience was great. Will recommend to our friends and definitely return again. :)"}
{"text":"If you have a big appetite you should definitely try this place. Their portion is huge! First, they will treat you with a complimentary cornbread (the best I've ever tasted), then they'll take your order..if usually order their q rolls for appetizer and then 2 ribs ( all three types are good so I'd recommend trying all of them), then they'll have a complimentary dessert for us. I can never finish their food..way too much! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Just like last time I was here, the food was fantastic as was the service. The portions are exceptionally generous and the meat tender and filling. This time I ordered a bbq brisket sandwich with macaroni, and the macaroni alone threatened to fill me up.

All five of my table took boxes home, maybe eating half the food from single entree orders.

Then they gave us free doughnuts to take home.

The restaurant tends to be loud, but the service is excellent ( shout out to Cameron F, who was on top of service tonight in a full house and never missed a beat, nor did he overwhelm). Well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots! My 6 year old LOVES it here! 

Baby Back Ribs = AMAZING! 
Burgers = JUICY! 
Brisket = PERFECT! 
Pulled Pork = SPECTACULAR! 

They have great shoe string fries! The only thing that falls a little short was the corn bread. Needs a little perfecting. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"No need for a lot of words...food speaks for itself.  Hands down the best BBQ I have ever eaten in my life!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. We were a party of 11 which included 5 kids and 6 adults.  I called for reservations on a Saturday night,  and I was glad I did, because the place was packed. They had our table set up in a private room which was awesome. The food was delicious and huge quantity. The service was spectacular and if ever back in town, I will definitely be visiting this place again. Thank you for an enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we were very impressed. The manager gave us a free appetizer and greeted us and all the tables around us. Our waiter Tanner was outstanding. The food was exceptional and the price was reasonable. We will be back."}
{"text":"Such bad service today came in to order some wings ordered them extra crispy at 3:56 and had to come all the way back because they weren't cooked right at all mind u I came all the way back from 83rd Ave and Thomas do know the time is 5:45 they replaced the wings but not the pizza that know was cold due to there error but no credit no owner came over no manager just not good service anymore"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, especially the baby back ribs. Well priced for the amount of food that you are getting. Didnt even wait long for the food to be ready. Shout out to Cody for being an awesome waiter. Great service. Great food. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Parker and Christie were great! They were both very attentive to our group as well as all others. The food was delicious! Defiantly coming back next year after a DODGERS spring training game!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was so delicious! We were expecting a hole in the wall Bbq place but we're surprised to see how big and nice it was. There was a long wait but for some reason the hostesses sat us almost immediately! (My husband flirted w them I think lol!) our server gave us amazing service! Our favorite was the brisket and I ate like 5 corn bread muffins! We definitely will return when in town again!"}
{"text":"Bobby Q's has one of the best Mac n' cheese in the valley! Everything I have had here is AMAZING! So good that my husband and I had them cater our wedding and it was still good even though it had to travel and sit before it was consumed! One of our favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Briskets melt in my month. They make me smile and happy. Food is good, service is good. My husband says the briskets are too soft but not me. PERFECT and BEST IN TOWN! 
My son got ribs kids meal. They were way too smokey. Not sure that's how it supposed to taste. Smokey flavor was overwhelming and he did not eat much. 
We get free homemade donuts after meal. They do taste good but not my favorite. To me, too greasy."}
{"text":"We were craving ribs after a long day of hiking so we decided to try this spot on our way back home. We were in for a real treat!! First off, we were seated immediately in their beautiful patio. Our waiter was super attentive and friendly. We all ordered ribs, and were expecting to wait a while for our food. Seconds after bringing out some steamy fresh cornbread, our food comes out aswell. Everything was delicious and plenty. We all got to go boxes. To top it off, we got complimentary freshly made mini donuts on the way out. Delish!!! Our family will be back!"}
{"text":"We came in for a late lunch and found the staff and food to be exceptional! It was the first day of our spring training vacation and it couldn't have been a better meal. The manager even came up to make sure there wasn't anything else they could do to make our experience even better. Would definitely recommend the ribs to those who visit Bobby Q's."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the service is extraordinary! I love the food, the people, and the atmosphere, it's just a great place to come with family and friends. If your"}
{"text":"Need to pull out all the stops and impress the boss and/or customer? Don't mess around with other places just come here! Best ribs ever!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed BBQ all over the country.  This is now my all time favorite!  I can't say enough about this place.  Our waiter, Harold provided excellent service.  Was our first time there and he went through all the menu options from appetizers to main course.  The appetizers were excellent.  We shared a plate of St Louis and Baby Back Ribs along with Brisket and Roasted Chicken.  Incredible!  Cooked perfectly and so tasty!!  Ribs were meaty, tender.  I had a dinner salad with Blue Cheese dressing.  The lettuce was crisp and the dressing was very good.  The sides dishes were also perfect.  We had Mac and Cheese, mashed potatoes and green vegetables.  Everything was so, SO GOOD!  There's usually something that just ok...at any restaurant but not last night!  The portions were HUGE and every bite was equally delicious.  I almost forgot about the corn bread and corn off the cob.  Both so fresh and tasty!  We shared a sampler entree and we were so full.  If that's not enough, they bring you a small bag of fresh doughnuts with sugar/cinnamon.  Said I was too full but the Manager twisted my arm and convinced me that I had room for one!  Absolutely delicious!!    I highly recommend this place.  Make sure to go there hungry!!"}
{"text":"I do love Barbeque and ribs and Bobby Q delivers exactly what you pay for.

Pulled pork is good, but not as good as Texas Roadhouse up the street.
Ribs are all right, but the meat quality is no where near that of a 4 or 5 star joint.
Steak is just bad. 

This is an ideal place for take-out or a quick lunch sit in; don't bring your bbq savvy friends or girlfriend here."}
{"text":"Wow!! I'm so impressed with absolutely everything about this place! 
The ambiance was great and very classy! Granted we walked in wearing practically sweatpants and hats, no one made us feel uncomfortable for our attire! 
It is more on the fine dining side of BBQ, which I think is awesome! :) 
They sat us right away with big smiles and asked us how our day was going! Very polite and sweet hostess! 
Our server was also wonderful! Brought us refills before we needed to even ask. Made great suggestions for the menu, and explained the restaurant to us since it was our first time in

We decided to split the baby back ribs which came with two sides and cornbread! Omg amazing and SO much food! I ate the leftover ribs for breakfast! Lol 

I was so impressed at how wonderful everything tasted and how great the service was. 
Manager even came over to each of the tables and interacted with us, offering us refills and confirming the food was to our standards! 

I noticed the table next to us, had an uneven table which wobbled a little, and the staff switched it our immediately and made sure they were comfortable. 

I was totally impressed with every part of our meal, to the interactions with staff, to the wonderful delicious food! 
Menu has so many choices! We can't wait to go back for some more fabulous BBQ! 
Yum! Oh and the donuts are heaven!
And being 34 weeks pregnant and constantly craving BBQ, we will probably be coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever been to. 

The food was absolutely fantastic. You have to get the hog and share so everyone gets to try all the different kinds of meat.we ordered every single side dish and they were all fantastic. The service was great like a friendly family. Both kids and adults loved the whole experience. Very cool atmosphere. 

Don't leave without having the complimentary fresh doughnut"}
{"text":"Delicious! I receive excellent service. I've been a fan for years and will continue to take my family and friends."}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue!! My mother & I came here & loved it all. Pulled pork, fries, drinks. They gave cornbread to start & donuts to end. I recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to drive past this place daily and have always heard great things about their food.  I remember going there when it was Bobby McGee's.  They still have the club ambiance late night and it looks pretty popping if you are into that.  We just went for the food.

I was stoked after checking in to see that they offered a first Yelp check in for 10% off your check, score.  The food was great.  My wife had the rib platter, very tasty, juicy and the BBQ sauce was delicious.  I had a Catfish Po'Boy along with a side of Mac n' Cheese, both were great.  They have plenty of drinks and a nice selection of beer on tap.

Thank you Bobby Q's, when I am in the need of BBQ I will be back."}
{"text":"The location is this place is hidden but once it's found you will fall in love!  Once we arrived we were greeted by lovely staff.  The place itself is gorgeous.  

They gave complementary Cornbread and butter, this was soooo delicious!!!!! 

We order a small feast, for $50! This was a choice of 3 meats.  This was a perfect size for 2 people. Now, the sides were on the small side. 

I ordered the house sangria, it was way to good.  I expected good but not GREAT. 

For dessert, YES there was room for dessert, the apple pie cobbler was just warm enough to melt the giant scope of ice cream. 

As we left we were given a farewell with cinnamon sugar donuts!

If I ever come back to Phoenix this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight with a party of six adults two babies and they hit all the right points again. Thank you Bobby Q's for being consistent, warm, friendly and hospitable. Our server, Jonah, was attentive and brought us all the little extras that we needed with a smile. It was a special occasion because my folks are leaving to go back to their home on the East Coast and we don't get together very often so we were happy to be able to enjoy a good meal in a friendly place.  We will see you again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love BBQ.  As some pretty serious BBQ lovers, we came to this place because of its reviews on yelp.  Well, we were definitely not disappointed.

Service:  Definitely great service from the wait staff and manager.  The waitor did frequent checkbacks to our table (and those in our section).  He didn't seem rushed or in a hurry, even though it was a busy night.  This being a popular place to eat, I had assumed that we would get the \"rushed waitor\" treatment-- case was the opposite.  The manager came by to check on our meal as well and we received some good recommendations for the future.  

Food:  All I can really say is A++ Amazing.  We ordered a full baby-back rack of bbq ribs with macaroni & cheese & fries.  Ribs were definitely the best we've had.  You can tell they don't just slap them on the grill and throw some sauce on it.  Mac & cheese was very creamy, just the way it should be!  The fries were fries, what can I say...?  They were good.  

Overall:  We're going back again and again.  The resteraunt was loud at the time, but it's to be expected on a Friday night with music in the bar area.  Didn't mind at all--everyone we saw there seemed as though they didn't mind either."}
{"text":"Love the St Louis ribs,  not crazy about the beef ribs though.  The best cornbread! Service is usually good, and the prices are reasonable for the quality. A great neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Oh my god this place is good. Pulled pork, beef brisket, and oh yeah the Q-rools are all to die for. I would recommend anything on the menu cause I have tried it all. The smoasted chicken is unreal! For me I wont go anywhere else for BBQ except my own house.  The atmosphere is great and its a little dark &  there is a outside patio area as well. They have great lunch specials. The food portions are good size you will probably be taking some home.  And when your done and pay they bring you a little bag of the best little doughnuts ever.  Oh yeah Doughnuts."}
{"text":"My husband has been asking to eat at Bobby Q since we moved into our house in the north valley about 8 months ago.  We finally got around to it on his birthday last week.  On first entering, I felt like I was in a BBQ joint in Austin, TX.  The atmosphere was so Texan and down-home I might as well have been in Austin.  I ordered the special drink of the day, an adult Arnold Palmer.  One word:  AMAZING.  The lemonade they used really put it over the top.  So fresh and tart!  Everyone at our table was pleased with the abundance of meat and side items they received.  The icing on the cake was definitely the freshly fried mini cinnamon and sugar donuts they give you before you leave.  It's little touches like that that will beckon us to eat here again and again."}
{"text":"The interior is awesome the service is a wonderful it's very high-class very clean very welcoming in general it's really good barbecue I just have had far better barbecue for a lot cheaper. I would definitely suggest it to someone but not before I suggest about three or four different barbecue places first."}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST Baby Back Ribs I have ever had. I'm not joking. Tender, flavorful, fall off the bone, perfect amount of flavor and sauce.  Delicious.  The owner stopped by our table and ask if everything was fine. He was hustling. They really take the time to make sure everyone's meal was delicious and everyone is having a good time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my crew from school on lunch break from GCU. We sat on the very lovely patio. There are interesting fountains, and you don't feel like you're in the middle of Phoenix, which is always nice. The service was amazing. He took our picture without hesitation, and he knew we were on a time limit so he helped get our checks closed in a timely manner. I'd try this again for dinner sometime when I have the opportunity to relax a bit, but my impression was top notch!"}
{"text":"Great reviews from so many people so I feel less bad about a non-stelller review.  

Service was great - friendly and quick.
Rolled-Q was really good.
The bbq meat were a-ok.  Not bad, but I was expecting better from someone who makes it for a living.  Chicken and pork were fine but the brisket was a bit dry.  Ribs were not bad.

Free fresh donuts were nice :)

Conclusion is anything fried is good here."}
{"text":"Amazing sides with good BBQ

Positives:
I used to go here when it was Bobby McGees growing up. It is completely different now.  It's very nice on the inside. Been there twice and once was for a party we got our own private room!  Our staff was amazing!! So tentative and everything came out great.

The sides are my weakness here. Their potato salad is super good!! Mac n cheese is wonderful. Good slaw. The bbq is very good also. I would not say it's the best I've ever had.. But it is defiantly worthy of eating and paying for. Yummy!! We all loved our food. 

Negatives:
I don't have any complaints."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town. Not to mention the best Mac n cheese and potato salad! The steaks and burgers can compete with anyone else's too. The staff here is top notch and service is always fabulous. Don't forget to get your donuts as you leave! One of the valley's local gems."}
{"text":"We recently went there to celebrate a birthday. The beef brisket melts in your mouth. The roasted corn was delicious and the other barbecued meats (chicken, baby backs and beef ribs) were simply the best.

The desserts were very good too. The only downside was I lapsed into a food coma.

Our waiter Jason went above and beyond great customer service."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Service was excellent.. Food was great, along with the Smokey aroma throughout the restaurant. Nice job!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the Valley! Service is always wonderful. The meats are always tasty and tender (I think my husband and I have tried every option!) and the sides never disappoint. I dislike cornbread but theirs is AMAZING! I also usually get the Sangria, which is pretty good. 

All in all I think it's always been worth the wait (it gets busy on the weekends, just like everywhere else) and the money."}
{"text":"Me and my wife visited here for the first time last night. We started off with the Q rolls which was heaven rolled into a tortilla, one of my new favorite appetizers hands down. For dinner my wife ordered the 12oz steak with mashed potatoes and Mac n' cheese. The steak was cooked EXACTLY how she likes just the right amount of pink, juicy, and melt in your mouth amazing. The mashed potatoes were seasoned to perfection and she couldn't get enough of the Mac n cheese. I ordered the half rack of ribs and fries however when they brought our food they had accidentally brought out a crusted cod. I politely voiced the mistake and our server handled everything professionally and immediately corrected the order and even let us keep the cod and brought my ribs out. The ribs...I cannot stress how perfect my ribs were. I consider myself a rib lover. I order ribs at almost every restaurant that serves them and these ribs were hands down best ribs Iv ever had in my life! The meat would literally fall off the bone when you picked it up. The perfect amount of fat, no chewy parts at all, and the BBQ sauce was smothered all over. The meat just melted in your mouth. After dinner the manager came out to make sure we were taken care of and gave us free dessert for the mistake that was made. At no point in time was I disappointed in the service. Everything was spot on. This place is my new favorite place to eat in all of phoenix! I will most definitely be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah BBQ! I don't think I consider Arizona the south so I didn't think there would be a delicious BBQ place in Phoenix but I was wrong. Bobby q's is great for date night good for kids good for groups. Service was good and BBQ was legit. Get the baby backs! Yum! Falls of the bone it was so good I'm sure I overate. For sides we really liked the pecan slaw and liked the spicy BBQ sauce. For those who don't drink alcohol they make a nice virgin strawberry piña colada. Loved this place!"}
{"text":"I was told this place is a must try, and while the atmosphere and staff are great, the barbecue is pretty standard. I had a three meat combo of St. Louis style ribs, pulled pork and brisket. The pulled pork didn't have much texture and was kinda mushy. The ribs were very tender and had a nice rub  to them. The brisket was a bit dry and needed a bit of sauce to make it good. The coleslaw was creamy but not too creamy and beans were pretty pedestrian. Overall what really makes this place is the atmosphere and the service, otherwise fairly average. Oh the donuts to go are a nice touch on your way out!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I have never been disappointed. Brisket is delicious and perfectly tender. I've also had the pulled chicken and the catfish, both good. All the sides I've tried are tasty, the Mac and cheese is out of this world. They start with fresh cornbread that is also amazing. I grew up hating cornbread, but somehow decided to try it here, and now I'm hooked! The fresh mini donut things at the end of your meal are great too. It's great for lunch or dinner. I haven't been to their night club but I have eaten in the restaurant while the club was open. The club has a dress code which I did not meet, but I figured it didn't matter since I wanted eat. The bouncer gave me a funny look when I approached, obviously I can't wear jeans here! But then I explained that we just wanted to dine in the restaurant and he was more than happy to let us in. They also have a full bar, some good craft local beers on tap and decent cocktails. The atmosphere is really cool, inside and out in the outdoor seating area. You can't go wrong with this pace!"}
{"text":"After a long week of hard work,  my daughter and I always make a point to get together and have a nice dinner on Friday nights. We always struggle trying to find a new restaurant  to add to our short list of favorites. BobbyQ made that list longer last night.

We arrived at 7:15 on a Friday night. This place was hopping. There was parking readily available so I thought we would get in right away.  There were at least 40 people waiting for seating when we approached to hostess stand. She very kindly took my name and told me I would be seated in 1 hr and 15 mins. After having a light lunch, that was a long wait. So, I asked about the bar seating and was told find a spot and its yours. I hovered around the bar and found an open patio bar spot with 2 seats open. It was perfect. Plenty of space, no jockeying for elbow room. No talking over our neighbors. Absolutely perfect. Our bartender Chris was very attentive. I told him we were newbies and on a busy night he told us the story BobbyQ. He told us his favorite foods and got us some water. Said any of the 3 bartenders would take our order. 

We picked the whole hog heaven,  lots of food for 2 people, but allowed us to try 2 styles of ribs, 1/2 rotisserie chicken, and brisket. Also 3 side dishes for $48 bucks. There was so much food, we brought 80% home. 

The service: we were immediately served the complimentary cornbread. We ordered 2 strawberry lemonade and they were great. I thought I would be charged 4 bucks each but for these speciality drinks but they were 2.50. I pay that for a Coke in most places.   Settled in our seats and within mins our food arrived. And it was impressive. We enjoyed our dinner and asked for to go boxes. We packed our food and the store manager appeared ready to pack our boxes in BobbyQ shopping bag. He also brought the complimentary cinnamon donuts. Hot and yummy, we loved it. Thanks BobbyQ for a great Friday night! We will be back!

Notes: if you sit at the bar for dinner look for the outside patio seating. Not a huge fan of the Mac and cheese. Everything else Great! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We were impressed. Everything tasted absolutely delicious and the atmosphere is great too! The shrimp appetizer was so good we ordered a second! My 9 yr old loved the mac n cheese and said \"when I die I want this place to be heaven.\"  The baby back ribs fell off the bone and the mashed potatoes are to die for. Definitely check out Bobby Q's!"}
{"text":"The service we received from our waitress was Great! The food-not the best. I wouldn't recommend the calamari since the presentation looks like pile of cafeteria fish sticks and taste is similar to tofu. This was first and will be the last time coming here."}
{"text":"By far the best BBQ brisket I have ever had. To begin, the staff welcoming us was super friendly then the waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the pulled chicken sandwich, top sirloin. And brisket. Everything was fantastic except the sirloin...it had an amazing smoke flavor and was cooked to my preference however, the texture was very chewy. We told our waitress just so she knew however, she brought out her Manager Laura who was absolutely amazing. They brought out their kitchen manager Jack who gave us the grand tour in the kitchen. He showed us the smoker and explained the process of how everythijng was ran. When we arrived back to our table a brand new plate with an exact replica of my meal was sitting there. The new steak texture was amazing with the same great flavor. I'm positive it was just a bad cut and they went over and beyond to make sure we were pleased. It was a great experience and we can't wait to go back and taste everything. Thanks Bobby Q"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner at Bobby Q - good barbecue, sandwiches and plates. Just had beer -but definitely more to choose from. Enjoy.
,"}
{"text":"Came here after SF and AZ football game. Staff are friendly. I had my order to go, got a complimentary drink, strawberry lemonade. So good! Food is awesome, so tasty! I took the leftover back home (Los Angeles) and had it for dinner. Wish we have it in California or should I say Los Angeles :). Thank you Bobby Q!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious St Louis style ribs, corn bread patties, home style corn, shoestring fries, and prime rib that my husband and I shared. The BBQ is definitely one of the best we've had in Arizona and it's definitely worth taking a drive out to. The only reason that I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating was because our waitress was terrible she might've been having a bad day because she was really sweet but she completely forgot my drink and my husband's shrimp and fries with his meal after being reminded. When they finally brought it out the shrimp tasted off like plastic almost. Everyone has off days but that's just unacceptable. Other than the waitresses slip ups we absolutely loved our experience and would definitely come back! Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place waaay exceeded my expectations. I will admit, I went in not expecting such a great experience. The food, the service, everything was really first rate. For sure we will be back there. I just wish that it was closer. BTW even though it is closer, we will definitely not be back at their Mesa location. The 2 experiences had absolutely nothing in common."}
{"text":"My son and I came for lunch! YUM! Pricey for lunch but still great. He had a burger and fries which he loved!
I ordered the 3 meat combo with the expectation of having left overs. I did. We started with the Q-Rolls which were delicious. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I took a group of 7 here. They were really busy but there was a lot of people working. We hung out at the bar and had a drink while we waited. I liked this set-up since we were already starting to drink before we even sat down. Lots of great restaurants have this feature but most places in Phoenix are missing out on this. 

Everyone got something different but it was all good. We will be back."}
{"text":"Really good bbq! Generous portions and decent prices. Outdoor seating has a nice ambiance. My favorite meats were the baby back ribs and brisket. Seems to be a very popular place as it can get very crowded at times so make sure to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"You need to make a reservation for this place because it is always packed. It's always packed because it's amazing. The entire family loves it."}
{"text":"Service was excellent & the food was outstanding! The regular BBQ sauce is delicious along with the cornbread. They are voted the number 1 BBQ place in the nation and they lived up to that!"}
{"text":"How did yelp know I went to Bobby Q's for the first time? I had the chicken plate and it is fantastic.  Good service & fun decor. Scuba shop next door just made it all better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite resturants in Phoenix. Their baby back ribs are incredible way better than any ribs I've had in Texas"}
{"text":"By far the best BBQ I've had. A little tricky to get to but well worth it. The flavors just satisfy your craving for good old BBQ comfort foods. Can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"This is our first time here from California and can we say that from the first question I asked my server to my last bite of brisket I have been so pleased and in awe of this food. The manager stepped to our table and checked on us, which is how a manager should be. Overall great way to start our vacation!!! Worth the drive! Request Tasha for service !!!!!"}
{"text":"It may be impossible to find good pit bar-b-q outside of Texas.  I'm still hoping, but have not found it yet.  Fair warning, I'm hard to please when it comes to bar-b-q'd brisket.  In Southern Texas, the pit master starts cooking at 10PM to have meats ready for lunch the next day.

I've heard a lot of good things about Bobby Q from family members.  Was able to stop for a Saturday lunch today.  Ordered the two meat platter with cole slaw and potato salad.  

Nice attentive waitress brought out some cornbread muffins.  I grind my own corn meal and cook buttermilk cornbread in a cast iron pan I've had for twenty years.  Tough to compete with my cornbread.  These muffins have blenderized corn kernels to give them a little flavor.  They were the classic sweet cornbread.  Sweet with a little bit of canned corn taste.  Oh well, I came for the bar-b-q.  

Sliced brisket and sausage was served on a platter with sides in small bowels.  Oh no!  There was sauce drizzled on the brisket and sausage.  It's almost heresy to put sauce on good bar-b-q.  Definitely an insult to the pit master.  

The prime brisket was very tender.  Brisket is a tough cut of meat that has to be gently cooked for a long time to coax out the tenderness and flavor.  Even then it has to be cut across the grain to be tender.  These thick slices were amazingly tender.  There was no smoke ring.  Tender bland brisket.  The sauce was the star of this plate.  Crash and burn.  

The sausage had grill marks on the sliced sides.  Reheating on the grill did not help the flavor.  It was a little spicy, but had very little flavor from smoking.   Again, the flavor was from the sauce that covered it.

Cole slaw had chopped pecans on top.  Nice touch as I love pecans.   If the pecans were browned in a little butter, it would have helped a lot.  Otherwise, pretty plain cole slaw.  OK, but not special.

I've had awesome potato salad.  This Bobby Q's version was OK.   Good, but not anything to write home about.  

So, I continue to be a disappointed Texan.  Guess I'll have to invest in a smoker.  

Go to Bobby Q's for good service, quality tender meat, and good bar-b-q sauce in a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The service was great, the product was not. The meal started with some really good corn bread, so we had high hopes. The iced tea was so bad we sent it back twice and ended up switching to Pepsi. They forgot our appitizer until after they brought out the entre. The  q rolls were OK once they got to us. The pulled pork was so over cooked it was nearly the consistency of mashed potatoes. The brisket was ok, nothing worth the $22 price tag for the 2 meat combo. All that being said they knocked of the app and one drink."}
{"text":"Menu can be a little overwhelming for first timers because there are so many combinations make sure you ask your waiter for help. Everything is so delicious here you can tell they take their time on it. Managers will stop by to make sure you're enjoying your meal just a very positive atmosphere. This is for the restaurant only as I've never stayed for the club... who would after eating heavy BBQ hehe..."}
{"text":"OMG..meat coma with the whole hog feeds 2+..So good I couldn't stop eating. Sides were delicious too and be sure to ask for an extra side of spicy bbq sauce. So amazing. Love love this place. I came to take out an order and was immediately greeted and offered a complimentary beverage..I chose ice tea and waited about 15 to 20 min for the while hog. So worth the wait and I even got to sit with a chicken rotisserie sitting in front of me."}
{"text":"Landed in Phoenix and read all of the positive reviews here. I'm not really a meat girl but wanted to try this since barbecue is popular in Arizona. The restaurant itself has really nice to court and clean the staff was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the beef brisket and ribs which is good enough for two people. We ordered that with a side of the mac & cheese which was absolutely amazing and grilled vegetables to balance everything out. The bill wasn't so bad either I can get Casas around $30 which is pretty good for quality meat. Before we left we were given a complementary sugar donuts which definitely hit the spot. I'm giving this place 4 stars only because when we left we felt extremely heavy. I think it was the extra sauce that we asked for so definitely don't do that besides that this is a definity a Must"}
{"text":"This place is legit! Very good tasty food! Awesome environment! I visit Phoenix often - will stop by this place again. 

I ordered the brisket, pulled pork and ribs! Best in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Night life gets lit. The tacos are bomb!!! Especially on  taco Tuesday!!!! Gotta try them. Lol"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, tasty treats. The baby back ribs fall off the bone, the bbq sauce is really good, both the regular and spicy. Mashed potatoes delicious, brisket is good, chicken is good. I really haven't had anything I didn't like. :)"}
{"text":"Cameron our server was awesome. The atmosphere was awesome and so was the food. I was blown away. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Let's start this review out by making it clear that I am a \"smoker\".  In other words, I have my own rig, and I know how to use it.   My husband and I shared a \"whole hog\" meal.  St. Louis Ribs, Beef Ribs, Sausage and Brisket.  Of all of these meats, the only one that we didn't care for was the brisket.  Something was off and very mushy about it.  Brisket should be able to be pulled apart with your fingers, not completely fall apart like baby food.  For the sides we had baked potato, beans, and pecan coleslaw.  These were also great.

The atmosphere is somewhat contemporary, and very comfortable.  The service rocked!   It's no Mom and Pop place, but a great effort on their part for sure."}
{"text":"Complete jerks here. Not impressed.  Staff was rude, drinks overpriced (but expected). My phone was stolen out of my purse, and rudeness prevailed til the end. I'll never return."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ and great prices. We fed our family of 6 for about $50 and had a lot of food left over. Highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Loved this place - of course, another great find from Yelp! 

We were in the area, and headed on in due to great reviews. Can I just say - holy cow giant drinks! We ordered our drinks and they came out in fun \"glasses.\" And when I say glasses, I mean his was a ginormous martini style glass and my so-called glass was a cut out pineapple. The people at the table next to us on the patio were like...um, what did you two order?? We had no answers for them other than...awesomeness apparently! I've had some small martinis for $10 before...so this was just...whoa.

I had the pulled pork and mac and cheese. I will admit that the pulled pork was a bit dry, but a little extra BBQ sauce and that's an easy fix. Plus the BBQ sauce was delicious, so it gave me an excuse to use more! Win. 

The mac and cheese was, for lack of a better word, luscious. Creamy, cheesy and everything good southern style comfort food mac and cheese should be.

The real winner here for me was hands down the cornbread though. I'm a huge cornbread fanatic, and theirs was true southern to the core. Well done Bobbby Q, well done.

Overall: A+
Some good southern BBQ with great sauce and great sides. And...the drinks..I mean seriously...the drinks!"}
{"text":"While in Scottsdale for the Barrett Jackson auction we saw this bbq restaurant from the freeway and decided to give it a try. 
LOVED IT!
Great craft cocktails - we had a few minutes wait so decided to order a drink at the bar. I really liked the cocktail menu and they had a good variety of beers on tap as well. Before we took our first sip, our table was ready. So off went to the dinning area.
Our server was very helpful and gave us a few tips on what they are know for, what he likes and answered any questions we had. He was training a new server and I felt he did a great job demonstrated how to help a first time customer.
The plates are huge! we had enough for lunch the next day. My cousin got the fried chicken, which was a crispy fried boneless chicken breast. It was very moist and super crunchy. The gravy on the mashed potatoes are is just like the gravy my grandma makes.  
My husband and I had a three meat combo and tried the ribs, hot link and brisket. All of them were moist and delicious. The beans were super yummy, my husband always bases his review of bbq on the beans and these got an A+. 
At the end they bring you a little bag of fresh hot, sugary sweet mini donuts. Ohhh be still my heart. We even had enough for our morning cup of coffee the next day."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in AZ! My mom and I came here for dinner and started our meal off with the Q-rolls for an appetizer. They were good and definitely worth a try. We then ordered the Hog Heaven for our entree. The Baby back ribs are so tender that they fall off the bone! The beef ribs were good but not as tender which was expected so no complaints here. The pulled pork and chicken are also delicious. As for the sides, the mac & cheese was good and creamy  but the baked beans and coleslaw were mediocre. We stuffed our bellies and still had enough for leftovers. This place is definitely on my list of places to bring people when they visit me in PHX."}
{"text":"The best barbecue anywhere. Good sauce with tender meats. The brisket was extraordinary! Cornbread and sides were also very good. Highly recommend this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Was not expecting food this good. I had the brisket and was not disappointed, the family had ribs and chicken. Both were very good in appearance and flavor. We will be back the next time we are in Arizona."}
{"text":"We ate here for Father's Day and had the pleasure of being served by Michael. Not only was our food great but our service was also amazing. The restaurant was packed so the good service was a pleasant surprise. Michael was on top of everything and very attentive to our needs. We go here often and have never gone wrong with the food!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this restaurant has the best food in Phoenix. Everything tastes great. I wish they were located in a safer neighborhood so that people can go there for dinner. But other than that, this place is amazing!!! I go there at least once a month to get my favorite \"smokehouse burger\". This is by far the best burger in AZ. I love burgers in general and I have tried just about every place in phx but I have to say this smokehouse burger beats them all."}
{"text":"Food was very good and service was great. I had the baby back ribs with Mac and cheese and coleslaw (if you don't like pecans - order without because only on top).  All of it was very flavorful but a lot of food. One of us had fried chicken platter which wasn't a great deal for what you got but several others got pulled pork sandwiches which they liked.  I would recommend sticking with smoked meats which is their thing anyway. Best part was the donuts they bring you at the end - they melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Whether you were going here for a dinner with your family or for a night on the town, especially on Thursday or Saturday night, this is a cool place to come kick back and enjoy yourself. The food is amazing and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"As a lover of BBQ, I cannot believe it took me 6 years of living in Arizona to find this gem. My girlfriend and I went here after much anticipation on a Sunday afternoon and we were blown away. This is not only THE best BBQ you can get in Arizona, but the service and ambiance are second to none. 

We shared the Whole Hog feast and had enough left over for a late night snack. The cornbread was the most amazing, moist, sweet corn cake I have tasted. Beef ribs?  Amazing, tender, juicy, beefy. Baby Backs? Fall off the bone and meaty, Pulled Pork? Juicy, smokey, melt in your mouth. Brisket? Full of sweet smoke and seasoning. I got an order of burnt ends to take home and the knocked my socks of with the seasoning and smoke - YUM!!!

The manager came by our table and chatted with us for a bit about our meal. She gave us a little history on how Booby Q's came to be. Later, our server came by and informed us we could pick any dessert we wanted - compliments of the manager. We picked the mud pie - again THE best I've ever had. At this point in the meal we were not surprised by the amazing-ness of the dessert. Wow! Hard to find service and attention to the customer like that anymore. 

All in all this is now in my top 3 favorite places to not just eat, but to dine in Arizona. In my opinion, a 5-star dining experience should cater to all 5 senses - Bobby Q's did just that. If I could give a bonus star, I would. If you have not been to this restaurant, stop searching Yelp right now and make plans to go. You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Bobby Q for years and finally had the opportunity with some friends. It's a really good place for BBQ!

I made a reservation (they get an extra shout out for being on Open Table) and it's a good thing I did. 6:15 on a Wednesday and the place was packed and many people waiting to be seated. We were promptly seated thanks to my reservation. 

Our server came by to take our drink order and asked if we wanted any appetizers. Knowing what we would most likely be in for food wise, we skipped the appetizers and went right to dinner. 

To drink I ordered sweet iced tea. $2.00 I love this stuff and order it wherever, whenever I can!  

Though we skipped the appetizers, we did order salads which were really great, $5.50. Ranch house salad, my favorite type anywhere. Crisp lettuce, cheese, tomato, red onion and ranch dressing. Simple and delicious! 

My friends split the Whole Hog Heaven platter. They could choose two kinds of ribs, two meats and three sides. They ended up ordering double ribs and double brisket. There was so much food that four people could have easily split it. $48.00

Being a prime rib fan, I had to go for it. I ordered the smoked 10oz slab $26.00. It was outstanding! I was a little afraid the smoked flavor would overpower the meat...Not at all. It was just right. My entree came with two sides so I had mac and cheese and potato salad. Both outstanding! 

Dessert was tempting as mud pie was available which I would normally go for. There just wasn't room after all that food! We did however receive a complimentary bag of mini doughnuts. Served hot and dusted with cinnamon and sugar. Delicious and just right. You can take those home if you want. 

Everything about our evening at Bobby Q was outstanding. We were taken very good care of by our server and management checked on us a couple of times. Special shout out to one of the managers on duty Donnie. He was very friendly and went above and beyond to make sure we were enjoying our evening. Nice touch! 

Be sure to try Bobby Q! It won't disappoint! Look for the Mesa location opening soon! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday with some friends, was a 2 hour wait to dine in (make a reservation!) But for take out once we ordered we got our food pretty dang quick, within 10-15 minutes. I got the Texas beef ribs with the pecan coleslaw and mac and cheese and the apple cobbler for desert. The ribs were really good, juicy and super flavorful. Coleslaw was tasty but not outstanding, the mac and cheese was amazing though. The desert was disappointing though unfortunately and just okay. Each order comes with cornbread that was hot and fresh and really tasty, just wish I had some cranberry sauce with it! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was honestly pretty hesitant on coming to Bobby Q for dinner because I had only heard of it being a night club. So when my cousin chose this spot for her birthday dinner I was a little bit skeptical. To my surprise it was a very nice casual dining setting and the food wasn't half bad! 

I ordered their 2 meat plate option that comes with 2 sides. I picked their rotisserie chicken and beef brisket along with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious! I even had some leftovers to take home. 

Afterwards we were given a bag of doughnuts!

I can see myself coming back!"}
{"text":"Make sure to make a reservation anytime you go, unless you're willing to wait a good 1-2 hours. Place fills up quick because of amazing food and service. My wife and I were sitting at our table within 2 minutes, we already knew what we wanted so we ordered right away. What was surprising is that the food came out within 5 minutes, not even enough time to enjoy my beer. We ordered the whole hog heaven which was $51, we were intensely stuffed and even had plenty of leftovers. That whole hog heaven could easily feed a family of four. Thumbs way up for this place."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was ok 
It wasn't as good as what we got at the Biltmore location, but it wasn't awful."}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch. Wow, was it good.

I took two friends there and they were just telling me bad experiences with burgers that they had. (They are very particular with their burgers.) They both agreed that the burgers they ordered and ate were the juiciest burgers they ever ate. From my perspective, they looked really delicious.

But I had the full rack of baby back ribs. Oh man. We were just wondering why their burgers came with knives, but my ribs didn't. Then I just pulled one off. Or should I say I kept it from falling off. Oh, that's why. Yeah, that tender. So good.

Loved the corn bread and the mini doughnuts they gave us for complimentary dessert.

Yep, Yelp came through again and brought me to a five star restaurant. Gotta love this."}
{"text":"It sucks that we don't have a Bobby Q where I'm from because this place was spectacular. The food was amazing, great/friendly staff, free dessert, plus complimentary mini donuts!!! Our waitress, Nicole, was super. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a business lunch there...we both had pulled pork, we both enjoyed it, therefore one dimensional review.

Recommended it to my daughter & son-in-law,  don't know what they ate, but, they liked it...hopefully not pulled pork ;)"}
{"text":"a little expensive but great food, great patio!
servers were friendly and service was fast!
we'll be back

{"text":"In an effort to cure our weekend blues - the hubby devised a new plan.  Instead of staring @ each other all weekend we alternate weekends and plan something for us to do.  Budget of $100.   No complaining!   

This was his weekend.  I'm one of those wives that loves a surprise/hates a surprise.  With that in mind I had great anxiety over the adventure ahead of me.  We start off with major construction going on our off ramp.  So we got a little side tracked and wound up going through some stranger parts of Phoenix.  I couldn't imagine a restaurant here so I was really starting to wonder what he had planned.  Then all of a sudden closer to the freeway there it is.  The most glorious signage I had ever seen.  Bobby Q's.  Fantastic.  He's gonna feed me and then the night will really begin. 

We head into the restaurant and everything is so cute.  It helped so much that tonight we could finally WANT to eat outdoors if we wanted to.  It's so much cooler.  We were told that it would be about five minutes.  We turned around, sat down and then our names were called.  Not bad.  I immediately notice the comfy little love seats and some of the tables.  We were not lucky enough to grab one of them but next time I tell you, my butt will be in one of them, or outside.  Tiffany came over and explained everything.  Which was great.  I love when wait staff knows their shit.  As a diet coke fanatic I will gladly let it pass that the competition is served in their restaurant.  I oped for the peach iced tea and had four more glasses after that.  At $1.75 how can you beat that.  And its not artificial tasting at all.  This was good.  Hubby had a beer that was specifically made for the restaurant.  BBQ Amber.  Good.  Went well with the meat.  Tiffany (who in my opinion is the epitome of what a wait person should be) immediately brought us some corn bread (to hold us over) and it was so good.  So GOOD.  I frosted mine like a mini cake with that butter and was all over it.  YUM.  When we put our drink order in we put an order for the Q-rolls in.  Before I was done with my first glass of iced tea - the appy was out. Think a smaller version of a taquito with beef brisket inside.  So awesome.  Good, just good!  I ordered the three meat combo (go big or go home) chicken, brisket and baby back ribs.  Chose mashed potatoes and corn as my sides.  Done and done.  Pic to follow.  I picked up a rib and it looked like the flintstone quarry.  Clean.  Not a lick of meat on it.  Where was the meat?  Oh on my plate.  It slid right off.  Not a touch of fat anywhere on it.  Melted on my mouth and was so good I was having trouble sharing.  The brisket was phenomenal.  The chicken with a touch of the spicy bbq sauce was run out on to the freeway and play good.  DELISH!  Do you get what I'm telling you here?  Hubby's meal was just as good.  Mac and cheese was great.  The corn.  O EM GEE the corn.  The little corn coins.  So cute and so damn good.  More peach iced tea.  At some point hubby used the term \"meat mayonaisse\" to describe the ribs.   He says that the fat on the ribs (which was minimal) melted in his mouth.  

The manager came over to check on us and what a doll she is.  I'm so mad that we didn't get her name.  Dear Manager - thank you again for the delish meal, the unexpected treat after and the great time we had on our date.  We will bring everyone we know there, we will suggest to everyone that they go there.  It was a real treat.  

To summarize - great place, great drinks, great service, great food, great manager, great dessert.  It will be our go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Bobby Q's is BBQ-licious! Definitely lives up to its reputation (#4 restaurant in Phoenix). Just walking in was a culinary treat. Prices are quite reasonable. Decor has a fun log cabiny feel. Very friendly, knowledgeable, helpful staff. We split the pulled pork sandwich with mac & cheese and calamari appetizers (unfortunately for me, I wasn't all that hungry). They brought out cornbread and gave us cute Thank Qs doughnut holes for a treat. We also got their sweet tea. And everything, literally all of it was great- like I'd actually recommend every bit of it to anyone! Well done Bobby Q!!"}
{"text":"What a great place in not such a great area. This place is excellent. The building itself it very cool; the inside decor is unique too. Our food was fantastic. We had the spinach and artichoke dip app and shared the huge meat platter. All the meat was smoked to perfection and was just what you expect with good BBQ. Our service was great. Hostess was very friendly and didn't make us wait. Our server (Christian?) was also on point. Never missed a refill and was super efficient. This place is defiantly up to par. I will highly recommend to anyone. Even though it's a far drive from my area. Plus they give you these amazing little donuts before you leave! Just another thing that makes this place exceptional."}
{"text":"Absolutely the very best BBQ  in AZ.  The meats are wonderful and the sides excellent.  The servers are very pleasant and patient.  The only restaurant to go to for BBQ.   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. Check out the Saturday Steak and Crab special, it is yummy. I really love the roasted corn."}
{"text":"Love this place! Got the pulled pork entree with 2 sides. The macaroni and cheese is to die for and the pulled pork is so moist and has so much flavor to it! Our waitress Stacy was phenomenal! She was very attentive to our needs by filling our drinks without asking, helping us with our take out and explaining how all the meat is prepared. If you want good barbecue come here you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Food is horrible and there dance night even worse security was doing drugs in the restroom and where offering to sell some worst place"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding. The food was delicious. We had Q Roll-Ups, an appetizer, and an absolute must! Then we had brisket and baby back ribs, outstanding! The macaroni and cheese was truly over-the-top excellent. Sharlie, our wonderful server, was lots of help in making good recommendations, super attentive and friendly, and always made sure we had everything we needed. She is a real Jewel! The manager, Taylor, stopped by with a personal greeting full of sincere warmth and genuine interest. No wonder this place is so fantastic! What a great bar they have, too! And oh my goodness... those insidious little puffs of delicious doughnuts fried in peanut oil they bring you at the end of your meal in the little to-go bag, The Perfect Touch of hospitality and Lord have mercy they are far too scrumptious! We are from out of town and eat out a lot and this place is at the top of our list!"}
{"text":"Went to Bobbie Q for the first time and plan on returning.  Our server was Jo and she did an excellent job of informing us about the history of the place and answering questions about the menu.  The food was served quickly and it was the correct temperature.

We enjoyed the cornbread as it had a hint of sweetness.  We had brisket and smoked chicken.  The sauce was very good.  Baby back ribs coming out of the kitchen looked meaty and delicious.  There is a smell of smokey meat before you enter the building that builds up your appetite.  Once inside, the decor is a pleasant surprise!  The manager did come to our table to ask about our experience and the complimentary mini donuts at the end of the meal were another pleasant surprise!  We'll be back!  This place ticks all the boxes."}
{"text":"This was are first time there, Great atmosphere awesome food, barbecue is the best I've had in this State would recommend and will be returning. The wait is worth it, service is quick!!!"}
{"text":"After a Sunday afternoon of sun and fun at a Spring Training game, my friend and I were kind-of, sort-of, well not really anywhere near Bobby Q.  OK, we were west of the 17 freeway, so I suppose that counts as \"near\".  In any event, since missing out on the UYE the previous week, I was happy to visit this new-to-me BBQ spot for a very late lunch/early dinner.

We were seated immediately, and started off with a couple of Blue Moons while perusing the menu.  It was extensive, with almost any type of BBQ combination you can imagine.  I did not take the time to review it all, because I only had eyes for one thing.  Brisket.  To sandwich, or not to sandwich, that was the only question.

We ended up selecting two BBQ platters - one with smoked BBQ brisket and the other with smoked pulled pork.  Each came with two sides - we chose mac n cheese, pecan cole slaw and potato salad.  Hey, wait, that is only three sides.  That is because we got two, count 'em TWO orders of mac & cheese.  Enable my bad habits!

Look!  Corn bread!  Warm, moist and topped with a healthy ball of butter.  It was probably a good thing we were only given two pieces.  I could have eaten a LOT of that...

Our meals arrived quickly, along with a carafe of spicy BBQ sauce (that went very well on the mac n cheese, I might add).  While the portion sizes weren't huge, they were still impressive.  It was immediately obvious that my friend liked my brisket better than the pulled pork.  How did I know this?  1) because it was OhSoVery good and 2) It was quickly disappearing from my plate without any effort from me!  Of the sides, of course I liked the mac n cheese the most - while it was not the oh so decadent Fleming's version, or the gooey cheesy version from Scottsdale BBQ, it still hit the spot.  

* We did make one strategic error.  While writing this review I noticed the Yelp Review Discount offer of 10% off the bill.  Too late to help us - but not too late to help you!  Go, eat, and ask for your discount!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food consistently and great BBQ! Decent service. Bill for four people was 90 bucks with good tip."}
{"text":"It was good, but didn't blow my mind. The sides were sub-par as expected. We have a SmokePro Camp Chef at home so maybe I am spoiled with what my husband makes? I just wasn't blown away by the BBQ and it wasn't any different than other places I've been. I did really enjoy the fried dough before we left. Those were yummy, but hard to mess up fried dough. Service was great and so was the atmosphere. Next time I would probably go with a simple sandwich rather than the 2 meat combo. My ribs were fall of the bone good and very tender."}
{"text":"Love this atmosphere and did I mention the free treat at the end?! (drool) I love the mac and cheese! it is a must, the staff is super nice as well. Great for birthdays, a date, or even to bring your family!"}
{"text":"First off,  I like this place.  Food's good.  Service too.  They have a policy there where the manager is required to visit your table.  That's fine,  just don't interrupt conversations at the table like what happened when I was there this weekend.  Yeah, it's your job, I get it but I was MID SENTENCE when I was interrupted by a manager to ask if everything was all right.  I lied and said, \"yes\" but I should have said, \"Yeah, everything was fine until you thought it was okay to interrupt me while I was talking.\"  Do your job, yes!!  Just learn some damn manners."}
{"text":"All was delish here !!!

Had the 3 meat platter with 2 sides and cornbread that I shared with the husband: we got the brisket, baby back ribs, and pulled pork. All the meat was moist and delicious and tasted great even without the BBQ sauce. We mac-n-cheese and grilled veggies for the sides...and both were yummy. My favorite was the cornbread...it was the best I have had and i would go just for that . They also give you these little fried donuts with cinnmaon and sugar for free before you leave and they were super sweet and yummy!! 

Did not know about the 10% off when I went...ooh well maybe next time.

Service was great too!!"}
{"text":"This was some of the best BBQ I have had! My daughter and I both got the sampler with ribs, chicken and brisket. All were fantastic! Will be back."}
{"text":"Buffalo wings were great and the beef ribs and corn bread were super yummy.  My steak was decent, it didn't taste like it was aged over 60 days.   Food was served very quick and like other reviewers mentioned, location is not that obvious."}
{"text":"Oh what a happy gal I am now that I have found this place. I've been here twice and both times were good. I totally have to agree that the brisket is pretty awesome.  The Q-Rolls are super delicious. Smoked brisket rolled in fried won ton with a chipotle dipping sauce. I was upset that I had to share them. Next time they are going to be my meal, along with the yummy corn bread. The only thing I'd stay away from next time is the sweet tea.  Can we say a cup of ice could not even water it down enough?  That said, I appreciate this local place that offers yelpers a 10 percent discount for some great food!  I will definitely be going back for the great service and BBQ."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best bbq brisket so tender it falls apart,sausage has an awesome smoked flavor try all the sides super flavorful! Service is second 2 none"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm at a lost of words because of how amazing Bobby-Q is. 
My husband and I tend to be picky with any place we eat. Tonight Monday night only about a 25min wait for seating anywhere. Pretty glad we got the outdoor seating.

Vince was our waiter tonight and wow above and beyond with customer service along with Chris who is a manager.
They must really strive on customer service because man it shows they are all on top of everything here.
Ok so where to start we started with the apps of the BBQ beef chimichanga things omg our kids couldn't stop eating them. As for main course my hubby got a half rack of ribs with potato salad and veggies(veggies not so great not even cooked all the way), I got the grilled shrimp in a Chimichurri sauce with Mac and cheese and roasted corn... all of it was amazing and I would order that again, as for my kids they got a pizza and it was very tasty they said.
Best part was the desert the little mini donuts
Soo yes I would come back my kids even said they will only eat BBQ from here!!!!"}
{"text":"O.M.G.!!!!!!  My mouth is drooling just typing this review.  

Back home (San Diego), the best bbq place to dine at is Phil's BBQ.  This place is 100 times better than Phil's.  We ordered the \"Whole Hog Heaven\" and it was plenty for two.  Their pulled chicked, brisket, ribs and beef ribs are delicious and came with 3 sides.  The Mac N Cheese (Yummy), the beans (Tasty) and the roasted corn (excellent) were a hit.  

When I go back to AZ, I will MAKE sure to come back to visit Bobby Q.   Trust me...You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good ribs, melt in your mouth brisket, ranch beans and pecan cole slaw were decent, award winning mac and cheese tasted just regular... nothing special but ours didn't have a cooked crust like other photos on here. All in all great \" BBQ\" place.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had!  And fried fresh donuts before you leave!?!! Seriously.  The lunch sampler is a must have.  Best brisket."}
{"text":"Let's start with the mini skillet cornbread, exactly as good as it sounds. The brisket rolls are the best with the BBQ sauce and ingenious. The slaw was good with the pecans. The roasted corn was excellent. The ranch beans are more southern and a lil too sweet for me. But seriously people. Cinnamon mini doughnuts?!? Wow wow wow wow"}
{"text":"Bobby Q is to legit to quit!
Having recently spent a few months in Texas and KC, I figured that Bobby Q would not match up or be as good as I remembered.

I was WRONG this place is great! While it's by no means the quality of BBQ, its some of the best I've had outside of Texas and better than many places in Texas.

The Brisket is moist, not as smokey as it should be, but it's tender and full of flavor.
The Mac N Cheese is excellent.
The Corn also kicks A.

AZ is lucky to have a gem like this in their city. Most places around the country can't even get close to this.

Hats off to Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"heard so much about this place so HAD to try. the cornbread is good and we ordered the hog heaven. the ribs with the brisket and the pulled pork. DELICIOUS. best BBQ we've ever had. perfect portion for
us. the sides were small but there was enough meat to compensate for it. also, the service was super fast. less than 15 minutes after we ordered, the food had come out! will be coming again!"}
{"text":"The servers here are well trained and are very helpful when it comes to helping out with ordering. The meat here is perfect and I am not even a big BBQ guy. Not only is the meat great but so is the corn bread. The corn bread is complimentary but honestly it is my favorite thing about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Environment! The 3 meet plate is off the hook! Recommend sharing this to open the posiabllities for other great items on the menu.."}
{"text":"Tommy did a huge job providing great service. The pulled pork had an amazing smoke ring...as did the brisket,..as did the chicken...and the q-rolls are a great idea. Good stuff--worthy of its rep!"}
{"text":"Ive been to the bar here and the restaurant one time. The restaurant serves fresh donuts they make there (great way to entertain the kids) and has good bbq food. I dont remember too much but from what I recall everything tasted fine. Good place to take families."}
{"text":"Brisket is unbelievable. Try the mash potatoes and mac & cheese as your sides. You will NOT be dissapointed!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my top picks for brisket! Love ordering brisket and baby backs with coleslaw and shoe string fries! Fast service, came here on a holiday and it was minimal wait time for seating, and the food was out in a jiffy! The sangria is my usual drink choice and the banana pudding something cake is a great closer!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. The weather was perfect for lunch outside and the lunch menu was fairly priced. I got the sampler to try all of the best BBQ. The brisket was a little dry but the ribs were to die for! I will be back again hopefully soon. I will get a full rack of ribs for my entire meal though. Juicy, fall of the bone, perfect smoky flavor. You can tell Bobby Q's knows what they're talking about when it comes to the ribs. 

I can tell this is something I will be craving again."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. The meat just falls off the none, the sauce is fantastic, most of the sides are great, and the service is always friendly.

Finding this place can be a bit of a challenge, I've found that using the frontage road to get there almost always ends in a u-turn but well worth the difficulty. And this place can get packed so definitely make reservations, even if you're a small group. 

There is plenty of room for large groups, though it is really loud and very crowded on weekend nights when the connected club is open. I have yet to check out the Q-Lounge but it looks fun!

I always get the Q-Rolls, which are like southwest brisket filled eggrolls of joy with a side of chipotle aioli. They offer tons of meal options, including ones that are great to split even with more than one person. Their brisket is delicious and their shredded pork is great but its their ribs that leave me wanting more for days to come. The meat just falls right off the bone and I can hardly finish more than 3 of them before I'm stuffed. I happily eat the left overs for days! 

They also have great sides, their corn and mashed potatoes are definitely my favorites. Their roasted veggies do leave a bit to be desired flavor-wise but the portion is still large. When you're seated, the table is given corn bread and butter which is so good, you have to remind yourself not to fill up before your food even gets to the table! And when you leave they give you a small bag of donut holes! Seriously this place makes you feel like family and makes sure you leave stuffed."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the Phoenix area for a few days and picked this restaurant based on the excellent reviews. Having eaten there I can say that the high rating is very well deserved. The meat was tender and flavorful and the sides were excellent. All too often the side dishes are afterthoughts, but Bobby Q takes just as much care with the side dishes resulting in a mask where every single bite is delicious."}
{"text":"Taylor Branch who is the dining room manager is fantastic! Professional, courteous, knowledgeable and extremely friendly. We have had dinner at this restaurant several times and largely due to the outstanding customer service we receive from Taylor as well as the great food! We will continue to visit this location."}
{"text":"Everything is relative to the area.  So I will say that this is definitely the best in Phoenix or anywhere else in Arizona.  No chain or mom&pop shop can compare to Bobby Q's.

I ordered take out but their little after dinner doughnuts were a nice twist to bbq.  And the cornbread was certainly better than average.  My favorite part comes when we speak of the macaroni&cheese.  Who and how in the world did someone in Phoenix learn how to make mac n cheese like this ?!  I was skeptical when I looked at it because it was an off-white color.  But it was creamy and full of rich flavor.  I ordered the smoasted chicken and drizzled some of that bbq sauce on it.  It was well cooked and the bbq sauce was high quality with a little zip and long lasting good after taste.  Strongly recommed the sauce (on the smoasted chicken) and mac n cheese. 

Your mouth will water when we talk about the peach cobbler.  It's not the best I've had (3 places I've tried around the world have been better) but it's a B+++++.  The crust is almost candied and melts in your mouth.  The flavor is NOT too sweet or powerful to the point where you can only eat a few bites.  It was well put together.

To top it off, the person who answered the phone and took my order (and my money) had her customer service skills in high gear.  She made me want to return because I felt like I was being taken care of.  Big smile, plenty of suggestions on whether I wanted her to include an extra cornbread or a couple extra doughnuts....at no charge.  Very accomodating so I had no problem living her a nice sized tip.  She made the experience enjoyable and I will be back time and time again!!!"}
{"text":"If you live in Phoenix you need to eat this BBQ! I had the pulled pork and loved it I did need more sauce but I like a tone of sauce."}
{"text":"I had a two hour layover coming from Austin, TX through PHX and onto San Francisco.  I knew I would be cutting it close, but I jumped in an Uber and hightailed it over to Bobby Q.  The I-10 shooter couldn't even stop me from getting to my barbecue beef ribs and buying chef Mark H. a drink.  I was greeted by a lovely hostess and waitress named Jessica.  I got seated at a large booth, ordered a drink, and my beef ribs.  The drink and food appeared quickly.  The Bobby Q experience is simply the best.  The whole staff is just plain awesome.  Various people came by to bus plates, ask how I was doing, and see if there was anything they could help me with.  It was a great meal with some serious cornbread and mini-doughnut dessert.  I LOVE PEOPLE FROM PHOENIX AND I LOVE COMING TO BOBBY Q!

Unfortunately, chef Mark was not there, but I did make my flight home.  Chef Mark, if you read this, \"I owe you a drink.\""}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ in town. Very nice place! The service here was amazing and very attentive to our table, even though they were busy.. Our orders  came out on perfect  time and it served warm and fresh. We had a good choice of entrees and appetizers and everyone  was very happy with our delicious meals.  The manager checks  on us many times to make sure we're having a great time. I will definitely be returning here again."}
{"text":"We had lunch at this place on our recent trip to Phoenix.  We came in between lunch and dinner and were seated promptly.  My husband and I ordered a full baby back with grilled veggies and shoestring fries on the side to split.  My son ordered the chicken tenders with shoestring fries on the side.  The food was amazing.  Our ribs were very tender and fell off the bone.  The sauce was not overly sweet which was also a plus.  The veggies were grilled well and not too overly cooked.  The shoestring fries had enough crunch and saltiness.  My son I'm sure enjoyed his food because he ate the leftover chicken tenders for dinner, and he doesn't normally eat leftovers.  Our drinks were never empty.  The server was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed - extra sauce, drinks, etc...  The bathrooms were clean which is always a plus.  The only thing is that I wished they had sweet potato fries on the menu too.  Their fries were good, but love sweet potato fries with my ribs.  Great food, great service, ample parking, clean bathrooms.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"this is where i go for bbq in phx!!!

my family loves going here.  we have gone in small and large groups.  they are very accommodating.  even with reservations it takes awhile to be seated.  eventhough there is a lot of seating this restaurant is always busy.  they even have private rooms.  the restaurant is very nice inside and the customers are even dress real nice.  looks kinda weird seeing folks dress professional in a bbq joint.  if busy the parking kinda sucks.

the food is awesome!  everything that my family has tried as been awesome.  the corn bread and honey butter is delicious!  the ribs, steak, chicken, grilled salmon, salads, fries, it's all good!

the servers seem to do a great job and never had one problem.  great job!

i hope you enjoy this place because i do!"}
{"text":"Any one who gives this place more than 3 stars is taste bud deficient. Lesson #1: good BBQ has some smoke to the meat (this place has NO smoky flavor to their meat)
Lesson #2: there was no smoke ring that denote it spent any time cooking low and slow like they advertise. 
Lesson #3: the meat fell of the bone (Great BBQ is removed from the bone, not fall off the bone. Kansas City BBQ Society rules)
I suspect that the baby back ribs I was served were first boiled, then placed on the grill right before it was slathered with raunchy sauce.
The only reason it got 2 stars was because our waitress was fabulous, giving great service with nice atmospheres."}
{"text":"We had a great time here last night! Friendly service and the filet mignon was awesome as usual! Justin was great! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Service here is amazing. While a coworker and I were waiting for the rest of our party, the probably-owner offered us drinks, and the waiter checked in with us a fair few times to make sure everything was good.

Food was...not so amazing. Portions are large enough for 3 people, and none of those people are meant to be me.

I ordered the 1) 8oz sirloin steak with 2) mac n cheese and 3) shoelace fries, along with a 4) frozen strawberry lemonade. 

1) Ordered medium rare. Average steak. There was a vein of unchewable running through it that I had to spit out. It really is quite massive and is the only thing I wound up finishing or even putting a dent into.

2) Waaaay rich. Like eating a bowl of solid melting cheese. Not my thing, but maybe it is yours.

3) Fried breaded onions. Like onion rings, but also like eating oil.

4) Unbelievably, jaw-achingly sour. The waitstaff offered me another to replace it, which was just as sour, but it couldn't be helped.

Tl;dr: 5 star service, 3 star food."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday for some wings, sat at the bar to watch FIFA games. Wings were fantastic! And Sharli made me the best cocktails. This place gets busy fast, but the bar service was 5*!"}
{"text":"Tasty BBQ! We ordered the lunch sampler plate and picked brisket, baby back ribs, and BBQ chicken! Also got a chicken cranberry salad! The BBQ meats were very tender and flavorful! The salad was fresh and tasted good, too! They give you complementary corn bread in the beginning of the meal and freshly fried donuts after the meal :)
Country music playing in the restaurant~ there's also an outdoor patio area with string lights that look very pretty."}
{"text":"We love Bobby Q, it never disappoints. We took our adult son and everything we ordered was perfect. I had the salmon and the guys both had ribs. There was plenty to take home and enjoy for lunches the next day."}
{"text":"Great place ... reasonably priced, fast and the service was superb! Sit on the patio if it's not too hot."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for a few days this week, and this place was right down the street from my hotel. Outstanding service by Chelsea at the bar. Very friendly, excellent bartender and had a great rapport with all of her customers, whether they were a regular or someone new. Next time I'm in town, this is my first stop. Food was excellent."}
{"text":"Coming from Virginia, I have some pretty strong opinions on what good barbecue is. For the most part, I've avoided barbecue since moving to Arizona, but my friends wanted to try out Bobby Qs, so trying out Bobby Qs we did.

We sat on the outdoor patio which was warmly lit and welcoming. Our server was incredibly friendly, which only added to the good vibes. Although not barbecue, the southern fried chicken caught my eye. I got it with creamy mashed potatoes and a delightful (maybe yogurty?) mac and cheese on the side. The cornbread that came with it was also heavenly. Though they are round and slightly more difficult to handle than the regular square ones, they were delicious and moist and there was more than enough butter that came with them.

My s/o got the pulled pork platter with roasted corn and shoestring fries. We traded our mashed potatoes and roasted corn because I absolutely ADORED the roasted corn. Perfectly buttery with such a good roasted flavor. Just thinking about it makes me hungry.

The only gripe I had was that for its price, there really wasn't that much food. It was enough for me to have leftovers, but it can't compare to my favorite bbq joint back home where $11 got you a pound of pulled pork."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends on a Friday evening and was told our wait would be around 40 minutes. Turns out we only waited 20 minutes!

The atmosphere inside was very nice, dim, loud, great for hanging out with friends or date night. The decor was very cool as well. Turns out on the other side of the restaurant you have a lounge area where it's blasting with music. Such a big restaurant!!

Our waitress was super nice, gave us some delicious cornbread first thing, and then gave us more. My boyfriend and I shared the two meat combo, with brisket and roasted chicken, and we chose mashed potatoes and mac and cheese for our two sides. It was delicious.

**^ this was written a while back and I never finished writing it. I've been back since and the food is still delicious! Tried the pulled pork quesadilla (YUM!) and southern fried chicken! Both were very delicious. Our server this time seemed new but he still tried his best to take care of us."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB, I was hauling butt down the freeway & out of the corner of my eye I saw a cool looking place to eat. It looked like an amusement park restaurant. I stopped at my hotel to drop my bags and called my coworkers and we met there. I ordered the whole hog & it was mighty tasty. They had cold beers and a full bar. After my meal I was thinking I couldn't be any happier and then they handed me a bag of mini donuts which were lightly covered in cinnamon & sugar. they tasted like a churro. this place is a must try for BBQ lovers. the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place! A must have when in Phoenix... the service can be slow but they always do their best to accommodate large parties which is awesome. Good food, always yummy!"}
{"text":"Any restaurant that gives you complimentary cinnamon donuts when you leave gets 5 stars in my book! The food is delicious too- great service and atmosphere. This is the second time I have been here and will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Okay firstly, I am from the South, so I grew up with \"pulled pork\" as the definition of barbeque. This place has got it and the sweet ice tea to go with it (one of the few things I miss from SC). My boyfriend and I dropped in here because we were in the neighborhood, and right off the smell was heavenly. It wasn't very busy, so I don't know if things would be different at another time, but the waitress was very friendly and we ordered and got our food in a timely fashion. Everything was delicious. We sat outside and I really enjoyed the sounds of the fountain (shaped like a still I think) and all the little succulents growing on the brick wall."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the BobbyQ Biltmore location with another couple last evening.  The drinks were great, the BBQ and steaks top notch as always, and our waiter was very good.  So why didn't we rate our experience as a 4 or 5?  I was shocked as we finished our last spoonful of dessert(bread pudding, yum!) and the manager walked over to our table and ask us to either leave our move to another table so that she could seat another party.  After spending over $250 for a dinner for 4 this just seemed very inappropriate to me.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Bobby Q...you had me at cornbread and donuts.

We made an open table reservation for 7:30 but arrived at 7:15 and were seated immediately. 

We ordered the whole hog ($38) that comes with your choice of two orders of ribs and two orders of meat and three sides. We decided to order the St Louis Ribs, baby back ribs, pulled pork and brisket. The sides were two orders of Mac n cheese (since our kiddos love Mac n cheese) and corn.  

Complimentary cornbread quickly arrived. Flatter than most corn breads it is packed with flavor. Tad oily but it was warm, moist and absolutely delicious.

As soon as we finished the bread our entrees arrived and we were shocked at the quantity. Could definitely feed 4 adults.  The St Louis Ribs...OMG! Yummy. Fall off the bone tender with excellent flavor. My boys who usually don't care for ribs ate half of the ribs.  The baby back was also delicious and less fatty. The pulled pork and brisket were also excellent although the ribs were definitely the highlight. Mac n cheese was incredibly creamy and perfect for the kiddos. Corn was a mix of slivers of Cobb and corn kernels in butter. Can't go wrong with that.

We couldn't finish our meal but that wasn't the end...they give you a brown bag labeled with \"thank q\" on it. Fresh hot, light and fluffy cinnamonny sugary goodness that tastes like fresh churros but with a mini donut texture.

10% off with check in only sweetens this place. Thanks Bobby Q for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path and the looks are deceiving.   Food and service was awesome.  Ribs were awesome along with service from Ashleigh."}
{"text":"Every visit for the past seven years have proven to be consistently amazing. Great service, flavorful food. Pretty much everything on the menu is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"They were so friendly here and the food was delicious. A bit expensive but it was worth it. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Let's get the bad's out of the way first.

The server advertised multi cheese Mac n Cheese. Stating it was the best!
Yes, it was good. But, at least 75% of the cheese was Velveta/processed cheese. It was smooth even when cold, real cheese doesn't do this.  But, again tasted very good.  Just don't exaggerate about its contents.

Thursday night at 6pm, they were busy and the speed proved that. 30min for two medium rare steaks. They were also still prepping the coleslaw due to them running out, which I received at the end of the meal.  Come earlier than 5:30pm!

Now, the Q-Rolls are absolutely awesome! Flakey, tasty and unique. Get them!

We ordered the 12oz Sirloin. Server stated 60 day aged in-house. It was super tender, flavorful and beautifully prepared! Seasoning very tasteful. If you like your steak well done, they you just burn your money away.  Medium or medium rare only!

The beans are very steak house like. Tangy, sweet with a depth of flavor. 

Servers are highly trained, consistence, very nice table-side manor. 

We'll be back and hopefully changing this review to 5-Stars. Have to do 4-stars now now."}
{"text":"Walked in for lunch was greeted and seated immediately.  Server was friendly, polite and attentive.  BBQ sampler was wonderful and the food came out quick despite it being very busy."}
{"text":"I eat here twice a month because it os close to work, but it's worth the drive from any where. It is one of the best BBQ joints I've eaten at. Staff are friendly and the service is good. I need to eat here sometime when I'm not working so I can enjoy a bevie. It's has a fun decor that is probably enhanced with alcohol. ;-)"}
{"text":"This might be my longest review ever. You don't have to read it, but you probably should. 

How this place has over 700 reviews to begin with is beyond me. Not even Amy's Baking Company has that many reviews and, as you might know, was heavily trolled after it aired on Kitchen Nightmares. They must be handing out money to folks for writing this shit. Or they're planted reviews. What's even more baffling is that it has a solid 4 stars. Methinks something is not quite right, but whatevs. Let's move on, shall we?

This place is truly bizarre. I've been here maybe a total of 3-4 times since it first opened many years ago. It's a BBQ restaurant / club-lounge thingy. And as I learned for the first time at happy hour yesterday, it's apparently two different restaurants. At least, that's how everyone acted. My boss had made reservations for us in the Q Lounge for their Friday happy hour. Apparently you can just walk in (provided you're 21) and eat a buffet spread for free. But not until you get past the LAUNDRY LIST of dress code rules. Yes, a restaurant that serves BBQ, near Ghettrocenter, has a fucking idiotic dress code. Seriously some of the dumbest shit I have ever seen. I thought I was in metro Phoenix at a BBQ restaurant, not a Scottsdale nightclub. The list includes asinine things such as: No white t-shirts, no hats, no sunglasses, no sandals, and must be a cougar. I wanted to be like, mo' fucker, do you know this is PHOENIX? We wear sunglasses upon walking up. We wear hats to shade our faces from the blazing sun. We wear sandals, often times fashionable ones, so our feet don't get all sweaty. And white t-shirts? Now you're just acting foolish. Of course, my boyfriend whom I invited, was wearing a white t-shirt, with a nice button-up collared dress shirt (it was unbuttoned), a hat (a nice one, like derby style), and sunglasses because um, to shield your eyes? He was asked to button up his shirt, remove his sunglasses (no shit Sherlock, don't we all once we get inside?), and remove his hat. Mind you, he's a nice dresser, not some hobo with tattered clothes (usually). Had I not been invited by my boss to this happy hour, I would've bounced right then and there. It all just seemed like some giant, corny joke.

Time for a paragraph break. It helps your eyeballs if you break things up. I'd like to point out that the actual restaurant portion does not honor said happy hour. That's right, you must go to the 21+ side with the fun dress code rules to have happy hour, even though it gets insanely crowded with nowhere to sit. Oh wait, you CAN order a happy hour beverage, but you have to get up from the table and walk your ass to the bar. If you order a beverage at your table, it'll be full price.

I will now talk about the redeeming qualities which merited that killer 2-star review. The food is very good. The mac and cheese is the cheesiest, and all of the meat is incredibly tender. A wee bit overpriced, but not awful. They also give you free freshly-made donuts when you leave instead of a damn dinner mint. That's pretty dope. The staff is very kind. Our sever, Alicia (sp?), was very sweet and accommodating. Kudos to her.

Lastly, it's confusing as shit to get into this place. The parking lot is weird, and if you've never been, you'll have no idea where to enter. The Q Lounge vs the restaurant portion. Two different places, remember. Even though...it's...not.

Note: Just don't dress like you live in Phoenix. You might not get inside to the dopest dance club in all of metro Phoenix."}
{"text":"1st time there... odds are it will be the last.  Ordered the BBQ pork and BBQ brisket sandwiches... couldn't taste the difference between the two.  the meat was tender but lacked flavor. 

The mac n cheese was just like store bought Velveta... nothing special... nothing great. 

The pickle was good...  tea wasn't bad. 

The peach cobbler... the crust tasted like it had onion powder in it.. really off putting. 

So... it was edible.. but.. it wasn't cracked up to what I thought the place was going to be after reading all the wonderful reviews.  Nice atmosphere... but... the BBQ wasn't anything special.  there are several smaller BBQ places around Phoenix which are much better.  Sadly... even Famous Dave's was better than this place IMO. 

So... 1 1/2 -2 stars....  I had much better.

{"text":"Best baby back ribs !  Service is always top notch and lively patio.  Tried the Q Rolls appetizer and they are delicious as is the fresh cornbread!  Our favorite bbq in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Stuffed our faces! Love this place! Great food! Our waiter Hal was awesome!!!  We walked away stuffed!!! The experience was made even better because of the great experience Hal gave us just by being the great waiter he is!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in AZ. I smoke meat every other month or so but love to be treated. Most places smother meats in crappy bbq sauce but they were really light on it and I got to enjoy the meat. I had the brisket and pulled pork. I have to say the brisket was hands done great!! The beans weren't anything special personally. But the corn was good as was the mac and chz and dear god how could I forget!!?? The corn bread! I'm super picky on corn bread but it was awesome! No honey needed!
Def a cute set up as well. The little booths around the bar was great. And they have a dance floor at night on the weekends. Awesome place! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered the ribs, they were really delicious! The BBQ sauce that came on the meat was awesome as well. My date and I ordered the baby back ribs, St. Louis ribs and the beef brisket. 

I guess my only complaint is that the ribs were too tender for my liking, completely falling off the bones - making it hard to eat them. 

Sides were bomb, mac and cheese was delicious and the corn was great. 

I would definitely come back here to eat - but might consider what other BBQ options there are before, simply in the sake of trying something new.. not because I was disappointed here at all! Great food and really fantastic service."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great atmosphere!  I have been coming here sine I was a kid and the food is always consistently good."}
{"text":"Although I don't eat meat anymore this is still our go to family restaurant. When I was younger I remember how amazing the food taste and that still remains the same. Would be awesome if there was some vegan BBQ options but I understand it's a meat house! 

Still my family and I come once a month, and my parents go to the night couple every Friday. If you're looking for a good time with the family or with friends and don't want to drive to two places. Come here on a Friday or Saturday, eat dinner the. Walk just past the hostess and go dance and work off those calories! 

Great staff, amazing bartenders, and nice management! 

Again, although I am vegetarian/Pescatarian I still enjoy myself and just eat salad and the salmons OH ! And You must try the Mac n Cheese !!"}
{"text":"Ok so we brought our brother and his girl Christina it was her Birthday! Devin and Orlando served us with quality, precision, yup hot food and AMAZING taste! We are amazed at how well this place has ran for years! Didn't know the manager has managed this place 5 years! Hats off tho the WHILE TEAM! Amazing place. So grateful that it is all the best of the best!!"}
{"text":"We read the reviews and were expecting a very good to excellent BBQ experience. Unfortunately, we had a mediocre to average dinner.  We tried \"the whole hog\" and expected generous portions of ribs, chicken, and sausage for the price.  We received lunch portions--at best.  The ribs were very dry albeit they fell off the bone.  The chicken was average and the sausage on the tasteless side.  The BBQ sauce was typical and really too sweet for this type of fare.  The corn was greasy, the fries were average string fries, and the mac and cheese was good (according to my wife since I think typical mac and cheese is too bland). We passed on dessert but we were given a gift of two small doughnuts that left a serious grease stain in the bag.  I thought the doughnuts were a weird accompaniment to this BBQ dinner.  I must commend the service as prompt, courteous, and very friendly--bravo.  Overall, the experience was so lackluster that we would be unlikely to return.  I did note that the bar and lounge scene was very active while the dining room had plenty of empty tables at 6 on a Friday.  Perhaps one should consider this more a bar and lounge and secondarily as a BBQ Emporium.  Something to thin about.  If you are looking for serious BBQ--look somewhere else."}

{"text":"I ordered a smokehouse burger with mashed potatoes.  The BBQ sauce is amazing, plain and simple.  It has the perfect amount of sweet and tangy.  It didn't go too well with the thousand island sauce, but that's of little consequence.  The setting is great and the prices are about average.  It's a nice place to go to hang out with friends or with family.  That said, I do have 3 complaints.

1. I ordered my burger medium-rare, and I received medium well.  
2. I felt very rushed to eat.  I was constantly asked if I'm finished.  Do I need a box?  etc.  Yes I know you have a line and I'm only one person, but I would still like to enjoy my meal instead of scarfing it down.
3. This is the worst offense.  I was watching the setting, and I noticed one waitress sneezed into her hand.  At first I thought she was going to go to the restroom to wash it off, but nope.  She turned and started to service another customer.  Yuck."}
{"text":"Can anyone say brisket? The brisket is to die for here and the mac and cheese is the best I've ever had in any restaurant.

The brisket is so tender that you can tell its been smoke d 12+ hours. The meat is so tendet it literally melts in your mouth. They actually use cheese in their mac and cheese instead of using a roux. If it wasnt I couldnt tell because it tastes so good. 

Not to even mention about the great service here. They explain their cooking process. They always check on you. I purchased a beer I tried for the first time and didnt like it. The server allowed an exchange for a fimiliar beer. I always get good service and food consistently here. Bobby Q is my BBQ spot whenever I come to visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"I went here tonight with my lady and everything was great. Ordered the St. Louis style ribs but wasn't a big fan. Mentioned it to the waiter and the GM came over and comped it. He got me the brisket platter instead, but also a few baby back ribs for us to try. Went way above and beyond my expectations! 

Also best macaroni and cheese I've ever had at a BBQ joint bar none!"}
{"text":"A Crowd favorite! I have been coming to Bobby Q's since I moved back to the valley in 2006. This place is great if you want BBQ. It isn't Texas BBQ, it isn't Kansas City BBQ, it isn't North Carolina BBQ. It is Arizona BBQ (If we had such a thing) - I can't get over the little things they do right here. From their BBQ egg rolls to their brisket, and little donuts for desert.. Where to start!? My wife and I generally get a 3 meat combo because you get a lot of variety. Their sauce is great they have a nice kick and I like that they do it right and not slather it on for you. Over the holidays this past year we had placed a reservation and we were accommodated easily. 16 people, not a single mistake, billing was done perfectly, and everyone was attentively taken care of during the meal. It so rarely happens with large groups we were impressed with the service. The prices are really reasonable compared to a few places that are a significantly closer for us, When people come to town, hungry - I send them your way. Keep up the great BBQ we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Yumm-o

Loved the brisket, so tender and not fatty like most places.  My husband said that the potato salad is the best ever.  Definitely worth returning and would encourage anyone that likes good BBQ to go."}
{"text":"Great bbq! Some of the best we have had. Our server, Carmella, was amazing and the rest of the staff were very friendly. Gives Texas a run for its money"}
{"text":"I had eaten the BBQ at the bar side on Friday nights were they have free food with a two drink minimum (diet Pepsi for me) and thought it was good. I finally made it to the restaurant side were I was told they had two smokers (a must for good BBQ). I went for the half order of baby back ribs and thought they were GREAT, darn good BBQ sauce too I must say. I got the beans and coleslaw with pecans, the beans are cowboy BBQ style, not bad and the slaw is very good, you also get corn bread that is better then mom makes, (my mom uses the box mix). One of the best BBQ joints in Phoenix for sure."}
{"text":"Maybe my son and I have different tastes than most of the reviewers or ate here on an off night. Our experience was that the decor, menu, service, and presentation were all great, however the BBQ was tasteless. We ordered the Whole Hog to share. It included two types of ribs and two meats. The meats were all beautifully prepared, fall-off-the-bone tender, looked great, and then very little taste except for the sweet sauce on everything.

Maybe we are BBQ-spoiled living in Texas."}
{"text":"Great barbeque! Came her on my birthday in July and Jack was our server. This was the best barbeque I've had in Phoenix, so far. Service was EXCELLENT (thanks Jack) Happy Hour was great, too. (Stayed for dinner after happy hour) Had the Baby Back ribs and chicken. Both were cooked perfect. You can't go wrong coming here if you're looking for good barbecue. Also, It gets busy after 6pm, so if you don't want to wait get there by 6."}
{"text":"Pretty much as good as it gets as far as BBQ is concerned. Ribs, coleslaw, cornbread,  peach tea..all awesome! Also the smokehouse burger is one of the best I've had.They also  bring these little doughnuts ( free) at the end that just melt in your mouth.. so delicious.  Service was great. Sit in Sawyers section. I hear Friday nights in the bar are a good time as well."}
{"text":"I love BBQ and I've wanted to try Bobby Q for a while so when the boyfriend had a friend coming to visit who was staying near here I suggested we try it out.

It's always a little scary to take someone to a place you've never been to but Bobby Q did not disappoint.

We started with their Q rolls for an appetizer. SO good. They are kinda like egg rolls but with brisket and they come with a chipotle dipping sauce that is really good. 

I ordered the brisket sandwich (apparently I was in a brisket kinda mood) which comes with shoestring fries and I ordered a side of mac n cheese as well. I'm not kidding when I say this is some of the best beef brisket I've ever had. It was so tender, not dry at all and it had just the right amount of sauce - enough to give you that rich BBQ flavor but not so much that the meat is swimming in it.
The fries were good but the mac n cheese was really good. VERY rich and creamy. I couldn't finish it all. 
The boyfriend had chicken and mashed potatoes. He said the chicken was good but the potatoes came without gravy. Maybe they forgot it? So those were kinda dull. 
Our friend got ribs and mac n cheese. The ribs looked amazing - fall off the bone type.

We stayed at the table really late - we were literally the last people in the place but they didn't seem to care that we were just hanging out which was cool. 

We didn't go to the bar next door but it was packed and looked like a fun place to grab a drink.

Bobby Q turned out to be a great place to bring a visitor since they let us talk forever and the food was tasty and reasonably priced. I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I'll say up front that, being a Texas BBQ fan (and resident), I was a bit skeptical of BBQ here in the desert, but I was here with a group from work, and they were footing the bill, so here we go. 

First up at the table, following beverage service, were baskets of little round cornbread rolls, a little smaller than hockey pucks, but far more tasty. They were a little sweet, but not overwhelmingly so, baked to a golden brown, and great with the supplied whipped butter. 

For the main course, I ordered a three meat plate with sliced brisket, ribs, and sausage, with a side of mac and cheese. Here's the rundown:

Brisket: This, alone with the other meats, had sauce already applied (I forgot to ask for it to be omitted), but it wasn't slathered with it. The meat was a tad bit dry, but it was what we call in Texas \"lean brisket\", so that was to be expected. It did, however, have good smoke and a pleasant flavor all around. It was also well seasoned, as were the other two meats. A good start to the meal!

Ribs: These were smallish, still \"assembled\", and looked quite nice. Upon digging in, they were a slight bit overcooked (definitely the \"falling off of the bone\" phase), but the meat was tender without being mushy, and it also had good smoke and flavor. There was also a quite nice meat to bone ratio. 

Sausage: The weakest of a decent spread of meats, this was a medium grind that wasn't overly \"Eckrich-y\", had good smoke, but the flavor just didn't wow me. 

Mac & cheese: A fairly standard offering, it did have a good, strong cheese flavor and creamy texture, but the pasta was overdone . 

This was really a nice meal. After the main service, a few bags of little donuts, sprinkled with sugar, arrived at the table. They were hot, fresh, and VERY tasty. It would have been totally easy to just eat the whole bag, but I limited myself to three :). Definitely check this place out if you want some decently good BBQ in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Great Barbeque. Love their Fried onions and they have fabulous Mac and cheese. The servers are friendly and helpful. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch... Catfish Po- boy was delicious. My son had the loaded baked potato with chicken and friend had a chicken salad. Everything was tasty. Our server Careron F was delightful.  He answered our questions and make sure we received all of our special substitutions.  We are already planning our return."}
{"text":"Overall had a great experience here. It was super packed but once we were seated I could see why. The ambience was warm and welcoming, the service impeccable, and the food absolutely delicious. I ordered the prime beef brisket platter with Mac and cheese and coleslaw and everything was portioned out perfectly for me. Thier alcoholic beverages were fun and creative and full of flavors. The cornbread was perfect and the complimentary sugar donuts were a great ending to our meal. As I'm sure others have said so far, I would highly recommend trying this place out"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Had an amazing time with the family celebrating a birthday! Definitely don't pass on the whole hog meal- we ordered two to share between 6 and we're able to sample a little of everything. You can't go wrong with anything your order, it's all amazing!"}
{"text":"Ok, let me start by saying I'm all about beef ribs.  If they are one the menu -that is what I'm having.  The beef ribs here were falling off the bone tender but relied way too much on the sauce and not enough on the smoke in the meat for flavor.  Overly sweet and no tangy heat that I expect on a good beef Q.  Like some odd mix of St. Louis style meets beef ribs.  I'd give them an 7/10.  And at $28 I'd expect a 10/10... Sides were hit and miss.  The whole corn was really exceptional - really a 10/10, great smoke flavor.  Slaw was ok but the pecans really didn't add and the slaw was lacking something 6/10.  Beans were good but again too sweet and not smokey 8/10.  My husband's brisket sandwich was pretty good but nothing outstanding.  He said 7/10.  

Friendly, fast, professional service was still not enough to push this review up to a 5*.  Overall pretty good but I probably wouldn't bother to go again.  I'll save my Q quota for somewhere in Texas..."}
{"text":"Went during lunchtime during the week. Was definitely pushing it on time. Our waitress was extremely nice and bubbly. Got in and out in 25 minutes and food was delicious. I recommend the brisket & potatoes salad."}
{"text":"I have been there three times now because it is absolutely delicious! 
The first time, I got the rotisserie chicken with grilled vegetables- both were outstanding!  
I have also had the salmon, which was great and cooked perfectly. 
I also went there with my family for a birthday celebration, so we all ordered various things.  The whole hog is great because it is a lot of food, and easily feeds 2 people.  The ribs are very tender, and the brisket is awesome!
Everything here is delicious, and this has definitely become one of my favorite places. 
The cornbread is a great little appetizer, though I wouldn't eat too much because I prefer to save room for all of the BBQ!  
Overall, the service is fantastic, and the food is awesome. 
Also, the donuts at the end, are a great touch! :-) 
I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, after seeing the reviews.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  Perhaps a steak is not what one orders at a bbq place.  

Staff was great.
Bob himself seemed respected by his team.
I loved the atmosphere.
Baked beans were really good.  Great texture.  Not just a soggy mess.
Onion strings were perfect.

The top sirloin I got was very tough, strings of gristle running through it, making it even harder to cut.
I didn't order the filet because I wanted more flavor than a filet usually provides.  The flavor of the sirloin was lack luster.  A good grill flavor but not much to it.
It was cooked perfectly. 

They did so much right but for a bbq place with not so great steak, I really want to go with 3.5 stars.

I'll be back to try the ribs and brisket.  I have high hopes that I will be updating my rating."}
{"text":"Good food, but they messed up our to-go order, they forgot the cornbread and one side, no mac and cheese tonight. How hard is it to put the food in the bag? We probably won't go back, Haps and Joe's Real BBQ are just as good, probably better, and they've never forgotten anything. Too hot to drive back to get the missing things."}
{"text":"I had the Beef ribs and I'd rate them as ok.  The meat was really tender and the sauce was good.  However, I couldn't detect any of that Smokey bbq taste that I enjoy.  Overall it was a decent meal, I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Best baby back rib ever. Amazing service. Reasonable price and great ambience."}
{"text":"Ive been to Bobby Qs 3 times now and I cant get enough of this place! The staff is super friendly everytime I come in and if you rrsd my other reviews you will know thats a big deal to me. The last time I was there I ordered the baby back ribs with mac and cheeese and mashed potatoes. When I got my food and picked up a rib the bone fell out clean. I cant tell you how satifying it is for that to happen. Great food, great staff, and donuts at the end of the meal! Isnt America great!"}
{"text":"This place was really good! Service was really great too. We had ordered an appetizer but they forgot to put it in, but we honestly forgot about it until after we ate our lunch. They ended up boxing the appetizer up for us to take home no charge (they really didn't have to but the gesture was nice). Good barbecue, definitely will go back."}
{"text":"We arrived early for our reservation for a party of five and sat at the bar. Very Friendly service throughout the evening. A very nice selection of beer on tap and a full assortment of beverages can be had. All five of us ordered a variety of BBQ dinners and each person was very pleased with their meals."}
{"text":"Went here for a MeetUp and was very impressed.  Service was good considering the sheer size of our group, food was excellent (I had pulled pork and it was delish!), and the little baggie of donuts was a fantastic end to the meal.  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable service and food! My wife and I went here on our way (moving) to Florida from California and were greeted with wonderful service. Everyone was super nice and even the manager checked on us. The food was truly out of this world and I'm sadden by this review knowing I live about 2,000 miles away."}
{"text":"I am not a happy camper right now. I have never exoerienced such discrimination until tonight! My friend came over and talked me into decorating for christmas. So after getting my christmas tree all done and watching movies all afternoon we decided to run out to Bobby Q's for a quick drink to celebrate the season. Me and my friend put candy canes on peoples cars in the parking lot to spread cheer. Dressed in a santa hat and candy cane headband we walked into the bar and ordered one drink. After ONE drink the bartender told us he wouldn't serve us anymore. Mind you ONE and he took my friends second away. We weren't acting weird or anything!! We were talking to people around us handing out candy canes. We took the receipt to the manager and asked her why the bartender felt like he  didnt want to serve us. She stumbled on her words and couldnt give us an answer. I feel it may have been because i was wearing a HD shirt with tatoo sleeves?? Idk but WOW is all I can say. I will never step foot in that establishment again!!"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ, but perhaps going there the day after Thanksgiving was not the best idea...I was still stuffed!  Next time, I will nkow to go hungrier!"}
{"text":"(Before I say anything, order the Q Rolls. I don't see a single possible way anyone could be disappointed by them. Unless you don't eat meat, and then I feel sorry for what you're missing out on.)

Finally went off the beaten path (literally) and tried Bobbie Q's after years and years of driving right by it along the I-17. If you're anything like me, you thought it may have looked a little questionable from the freeway. Old perhaps, run down, neglected? Let me assure you, none of these are the case at all. Once you navigate the side streets to find this hidden gem, you are sure to be pleasantly surprised just as we were. 

Prepare to be greeted at the hostess station inside a beautifully kept up and clean dining room. You may notice the donut machine just behind the hostesses making fresh little donuts which will be warm and waiting for you on the way out. Once seated, I highly recommend you order the Q Rolls, as stated at the beginning of the review. The beef brisket wrapped up inside them is out of this world good. Great dipping sauces too. 

For the entrees, we had a loaded baked potato with shredded chicken, a pulled pork plate, a brisket sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich. Aside from one small complaint of a little bit of extra fat in the pork plate serving, everything else was excellent. Didn't notice the fattiness in the pulled pork sandwich I had half of, so I'm guessing it was just a fluke. The half a brisket sandwich was outstanding and the potato with chicken was also very good. Tons of side dish choices too; sure to be something for everyone.

As for the service here, the servers and managers don't appear willing to let anyone get out of there unhappy. They pride themselves on having happy (and most likely return) customers. Just look at their current Yelp rating; that's not easy to do! We had two different managers come over and check on us at two different points during our meal. Our server took great care of us, even hooked my mom up with extra cornbread. Totally made her night. And to all of the guys out there: ice cubes in the urinals when it's time to relieve yourselves. How many places can claim that? ;-)"}
{"text":"I love their food! I always eat the smoked brisket with mac n cheese and coleslaw.. My husband always gets the two meat combo with mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. We love the mac n cheese and the doughnuts they give complimentary! 
The only thing I would say is try to make reservations because there is usually always a wait."}
{"text":"Literally the best customer service ever!!! The food was amazing as well! It is a hour drive for us but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"MEH. 
The hubs and I took a few friends here on Saturday night. They were JAM PACKED but sat us in the estimated 20 minute wait they gave us. 

Our waitress was good and quick, though she didn't come back for a loooong time at the end and we all were ready to just go. But they were busy, So I understand. 

My 3 star review is on the salad I got (I know right, who gets a salad at a BBQ place, this dummy does) I got the Avocado Club Salad with Brisket. For Avocado being the first descriptive word i was expecting a TON of avocado in this salad, I was soooo excited for all the avocado I would be consuming, unfortunately there were maybe 5 or 6 very very veryyy small pieces of avocado in the whole salad (trust me I searched that salad bowl over) not even a half of an avocado...so maybe just call t the Cobb salad and be done with it? The brisket was cold and salty. The ranch dressing was extremely watery. 

HOWEVEr the little corn cakes they bring you in the beginning were HEAVEN and the fresh made donuts at the end will drop you to your knees they are so amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Bobby Q was excellent for Father's Day lunch. Service was excellent and the food was the best BBQ ever! This is the best BBQ in Arizona! Yummm"}
{"text":"decided to try out this BBQ place while is was in Phoenix for spring training with the family.  The place is a bit hard to see from the road, and if you are not careful you will drive right past it.  The parking lot is a good size with plenty of parking, provided i was there for an early dinner so this may not be true during peak hours.

The entrance to the restaurant is on the side of the building.  inside there is a small bar and a nice dinning area.  You can see the chickens on the rotisserie in the back, and the smell makes you instantly hungry.  We were seated near the back and our waiter (Riley) was quick to greet us and make sure we were doing good.  Not knowing what to get Riley made a few suggestions for us to think about before taking out drink orders.  Most of us got the Bobby Q Amber Ale and one Strawberry Lemonade.

We decided to order the Whole Hog Heaven and a second order of ribs.  While we waited for our meal we had some of their fresh complementary corn bread and enjoyed our cold drinks.  Food came out in the right amount of time, not too long or too fast.  

All of the food was delicious and went well with the beer.  During our visit the staff was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.  Drinks never went empty and we had wet naps before we asked.  To finish everything off we got free doughnuts at the end.

This is one of the best BBQ places i have visited and i will definitely be back during my next visit."}
{"text":"Away from home on the 4th of July my boyfriend and I were craving BBQ and after scouring yelp for the best BBQ places we decided on Bobby Q.

With reviews upon reviews and pictures of the whole hog heaven the boyfriend and I told ourselves that we would not be tackling that beast on our own... but we did. After a conversation with our waiter it really did seem like the best option to sample what Bobby Q had to offer. And for the amount of food given, it was well worth the price.

Although overwhelmed when the platter arrived to our table, the boyfriend and I found ourselves quickly working our way through it. We had enough leftovers to stuff one person senseless. 

Do yourself a favor and opt for the baby back ribs and the st louis ribs. You get more bang for your buck this way instead of going for the beef back ribs which they will only serve you two of with the Whole Hog. Shoestring fries, baked beans, and mac and cheese were on point and if i had to do it all over again I probably wouldnt have gotten the pulled pork and asked for more brisket instead."}
{"text":"Delish!! Pulled pork was tender, great flavor, daughter loved her hamburger. The sides are fresh and taste great. Little pricey, but service is great."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and every time I come here I love the place. They have by far the most tender barbecue and great portions. I've never had a problem getting seating and the service is always been really good. Of course the hot donut holes on the way out our fantastic but I can only eat here on my dieting cheat days but it is definitely on the list of places to eat when I want to eat this kind of food. I really like the ambience as well. Another thing that's good is that the price points are where they should be so yours able to take big groups and family and their stuff for the family my kid is really picky and I like chicken fingers and he liked what they had

If there's any errors in this post it was done through Siri"}
{"text":"The best BBQ in Phoenix. So yummy and huge portions. Try the frozen lemonade is delicious"}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best bbq I've ever had. The brisket practically melts in your mouth, but it was the St. Louis-style ribs that were perfection. They seriously rival any ribs you'd get in Missouri or, frankly, anywhere in the country. 

My friend & I also got the Bobby Q Amber ale, which we were told was only sold at the restaurant & nowhere else in the world, and it's excellent.

The waitstaff were also extremely knowledgable and friendly. This place is a gem in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I wish there were at least vegetarian substitutes for even one meal. I ended up with a side of mac n cheese, and a \"vegetarian\" pizza that looked like it was assembled by a child, and tasted like flour and regret. Not really satisifying. Not worth the money. The 10% off coupon with yelp was a redeeming quality, at least."}
{"text":"We visited Bobby Q for the first time this week. The food and service was great. We ordered the ribs, chicken and brisket. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The brisket was tender and cooked perfectly. Our waiter was very attentive. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy the food at all. The BBQ sauce was ketchuppy and the brisket was spongy. You can get a better meal at Texas Roadhouse and pay less. I guess this has more classy ambiance but I'm after a good meal"}
{"text":"Good food, good staff, and those little doughnut holes...YUM!"}
{"text":"Food here is fantastic!!!  While this restaurant is a little tricky to find and not in the best of neighborhoods it is well worth the effort. My family and I had the three meat combo with sausage, baby back ribs,pulled pork, Mac n cheese,and pecan coleslaw.  Portions were big and enough for the 3 of us.  Corn bread and the great donut holes at the end really topped of the meal.  Love the atmosphere, decor and the service was great.   I highly recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, service is great! The prices are very reasonable especially for how much food you get. 

On the flip side, I wouldn't do the nightclub that it turns into after dark. They charge a cover for both males and females. The drinks are overpriced and the atmosphere is stuffy. Clientele that shows up after dark is very sketchy. Would never go there without a guy in tow. But I would definitely go for lunch or dinner! It's such a 180 its unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Love the side dishes. Always fantastic service. lol I'm mostly vegetarian so for me to go here it would seem like an oxymoron. But I love Bobby Qs."}
{"text":"In Arizona for spring training games.
Went with a friend who had been before.

Amazing food!

Our server Alexis and her contagious laugh and top notch service made the experience wonderful!

Our friend had her as their server when they were there before as well.

You are in Phoenix and hungry make Bobby Q's as definite destination !!!"}

{"text":"Excellent service! Came for lunch on a week day, the ambiance was perfect for a BBQ - not to mention the insanely good mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of BBQ (Sorry!) but the bf is so our friends decided to bring us here while we visited. My bf and friends bf had the Whole Hog Heaven. Being big eaters they were both happy and left full. I had the best southern fried chicken ever! Boneless chicken breast with the crispy outside (not chicken fried steak) it was amazing. Everyone at the table had a bite. Mash was great too. Service was quick. Staff was amazing. My bf wanted donuts (which they give you on the way out) before dinner and they gave them to him, he's spoiled.  Manager came over to chat with us which was really nice. She also gave us another bag of donuts on the way out for later. We will def be returning here for the best bbq ever!"}
{"text":"The brisket egg rolls make it a worthy place to stop, bbq bacon cheeseburger also is meal,worthy, hog heaven is well noted but didn't have it. Other items to eat and return again for"}
{"text":"Here is my opinion on Bobby Q. Let someone else take you. Why? Because I took some family members there, on my dine. And I learned the hard way that this place is a bit pricey. Four people, some ribs and a few drinks later and I went near $200. Not lots of drinks , either. The ribs though, AWESOME. We all agreed they were near the best. The grilled veggies seemed right off the fire. There was nothing we didn't like. Nothing. Even the coleslaw is special. Truly. Not a good place to treat multiple people to is all."}
{"text":"Nicole, 

Thank you for your assistance for preparing my birthday party. The Staff of BobbyQ's was outstanding last night and provided my guests with a very welcoming environment and monitored the area exceptionally. 

The food of course was excellent and even had to order more which was delivered promptly so nobody went hungry. 

Fantastic work. 

Thank you again, 

DBW"}

{"text":"Funky looking place- huge!  Liked it right away, even from the parking lot.  Friday night when we arrived, crowded and a long wait- about 40 minutes.  We ordered appetizers- the rolled ones with BRISKET in them!  Perfect with a cold Blue Moon beer.  Finally, got a table and a cool waiter who brought us warm cornbread- great start!  We ordered baby back ribs, catfish, fried chicken with baked potato, coleslaw (with pecans!) and, my favorite, the creamy mac & cheese.  Fantastic find.  Only wish we'd had room for the cobbler of the day!"}
{"text":"Love this place from the smoke house burger to the watermelon Margarita!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"BBQ here is amazing! Our family of 4 (kids are teens) had plenty of food with the Hog Heaven. Baby back ribs are falling off the bone. Brisket and pulled pork were flavorful and tender."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here and they didn't disappoint. I didn't have their signature pork but I had their jumbo chicken wings and they were delicious. We will definitely be back to try their pork!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place 4 times now. Every time I am satisfied because of the generous portions and lets not forget the free, hot, and fresh donuts at the end of your meal! I love this place!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite casual restaurant. Easily the best BBQ we've had, period. The beef brisket or baby back ribs are particularly good."}
{"text":"Possibly the best BBQ I've ever had. I recommend their Cajun Shrimp and their platter!! One word: DELICIOUS!!! Not to mention the beer they have on tap... all in all I will be back when I get back in town. I reside in OC or else I'd be there more often."}
{"text":"The best bbq around! My daughter and I fell in love with the brisket. You won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"on my way home from visiting family in Sedona, I thought it would be a good idea to stop in Phoenix to grab food before we drive back to California. Getting out of the heat without walking into an icebox made the meal very relaxing. My server Justin made sure to help me out with some amazing suggestions as well as made sure I never ran out of water or cornbread. I ended up getting a two meat combo of baby back ribs and some brisket. The brisket shredded easily and I couldn't pick up my ribs by the bone, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Visiting Arizona from the East Coast and read about Bobby Q's here on Yelp. We  decided to give it a try and were very glad we did. What a great time and meals we had. Our server \"Smitty\" was upbeat, he was very attentive to all our needs. The pulled pork and brisket were tender, tasteful, generously portioned and well above expectations. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The Q rolls were absolutely delicious. I am going to make that at home. You cannot go wrong with perfectly smoked brisket wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried to a crisp! The beef brisket was perfectly smoked and moist. 
It is certainly worth visiting while in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Our server Joe transformed our meal from another BBQ joint to a home cooked feast. Do go anywhere else for brisket."}
{"text":"I'll be very honest in saying, \"I'm not sure if I should be reviewing this establishment\". I say this because I'm not big on Barbecue, I'm not the rib or the brisket eater, so this review is based on the overall opinion of everyone in my party. Let's start with my Southern Fried Chicken, for me it was a bit disappointing, mainly because I didn't realize that it was going to be a boneless chicken breast (I blame myself for failure to pay attention to the menu description), it was very well cooked & seasoned, but just okay. I especially enjoyed the cornbread as did everyone at our table, so I do recommend the cornbread. The grill corn was good, but tasted a little like can corn. The Rib eaters absolutely loved their ribs and the brisket eaters had mixed emotions"}
{"text":"Love this place! We were on our way home from Tombstone and read the reviews on this place from Yelp and we had to stop by. I ordered the pulled bbq chicken sandwich with Mac n cheese and it was delicious! John was our server and he was super friendly! He was on it with the refills l! Towards the end of the meal the manager came by and talked to us. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Travis was an excellent server and the food was delicious!!! The atmosphere is really nice and we enjoyed sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"All crappy restaurant owners should take note. Bobby Q is basically a textbook example of how to successfully run a restaurant properly.    

Bobby's claims it was voted the Best BBQ in the US, although I'm not sure of their source? Nevertheless, I'd have a hard time arguing, as it definitely sets the bar extremely high. We've been here several times and have never had a bad meal. In fact, virtually everything we've tried on the menu seems to be done correctly. 

The pulled pork, which is my preferred way to eat BBQ, always manages to impress me with its flavor. For sides, I've had the mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese, which is far superior to that low-grade sludge they try to get away with dishing out at all of these other places in Phoenix. Even their fries are better than you'd expect.

The place is decorated to the point where, if I didn't know any better, I would have wrongfully assumed it was a chain restaurant. But yet, I like that, despite their popularity, they haven't decided to branch out and open up 20 different locations all over the city (and I actually hope they never do for quality and consistency purposes).

I've always wondered if their steaks are equally as good as their BBQ, but I've never wanted to sacrifice the taste of a great pulled pork sandwich in order to find out. And we're always so full after our meals that we've never been able to try some of their desserts. Based on their Yelp pictures, it seems like many people are in the same boat.

But, like all business owners should know, it's the little things that go a long way. The complimentary cornbread you receive before your meal is both unique, yet extremely well done. Oh, and that's not all. On your way out, you also get treated to a little bag of their homemade donuts, which you can often spot being made whenever you first walk in. I've said many times that it's little touches like that keep customers coming back - and it most definitely works. It's not rocket science and I'm amazed that other restaurants have failed to adopt this well-received approach.

Easily one the best BBQ experience in all of Phoenix and a great all-around business!"}
{"text":"I was invited to a bday party there. When I got there the bouncer decided that my jeans were to long???... Never heard of that before. This so called dress code seems to be a way to stop certin people from going in. People of color beware! Take your hard earned money somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm a BBQ whore. I grew up eating pulled pork in North Carolina. 

Move to so cal and for years couldn't find you some barbecue until I found a place called Phils. Which honestly is the best I've had anywhere consistently winning national awards

Upon moving to Phoenix I couldn't wait to try this place all I can say I was highly disappointed. The brisket was dry who pork was soggy the highlight of the meal was the cornbread and it cost me $28 no thanks. This place may have been the bomb years ago but not so much now"}
{"text":"Tried Bobby Q's after a long hot day in Phoenix, what a treat! Plenty of parking, friendly staff, and awesome food! From the cornbread and Arnold Palmer I started with and the brisket and beef ribs to finish me off! I was very pleased with everything, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best BBQ places I've ever been. Not only was the food absolutely amazing, but the service was superb! I highly recommend anyone visiting to eat here."}
{"text":"If you're ever cravin' some good ribs, steak, burgers... come down to Bobby Q's! My partner and I went here for date night and we were not disappointed. I ordered the ribs and they were dripping with flavor! My significant other had the burger with bacon (of course I had more than a few bites of his) and we both agreed it was the juiciest burger on the block. The macaroni and baked potato were SO delightful. It was a pretty busy evening for Bobby Q's but they managed very well by tending to their customers in a timely manner. 

Their club opens at 11, we had seen people lining up to go in as we left, so you know it must be poppin'. We haven't came here for the club portion, but let my food go down and sooner than you know it I'll be out on the dance floor. Overall, we had a wonderful night; great atmosphere, awesome service & superb food. We even got little doughnuts as a dessert when we left. We will definitely be coming back! And I can't even wait until we come back because it was that good."}
{"text":"The nicest staff you'll ever meet, great food and real southwest atmosphere!
You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Ribs (full rack), Steak and Cajun Shrimp a must! Start off with the onion block and then enjoy some cornbread as well prior to your entree.
The portions are large and the side dishes (2) come with each entree. So be careful how much you order- maybe one entree and some apps.
Sit inside or outside and use Open Table for no waiting! 

A win win for all the family!!!"}
{"text":"I used to eat a lot of barbecue but I haven't had much since I stopped eating pork. The waiter had multiple alternatives for me, including beef ribs which are difficult to find. I decided on the country fried chicken, and was not disappointed. Cocktails were awesome. Each side plus the main meal was delicious and perfected. The wait staff was friendly and helpful, and the ambiance was lovely. I don't live in Arizona, but I would move here just for Bobby Q's!"}
{"text":"This may be one of the finest barbecue places I have ever been to.  Not only was the barbecue I had fantastic. The service was outstanding. The food was quick to our table and they topped it off with free beignets for everyone. I truly wish they had this place in utah."}
{"text":"I organized a dinner here for my dragonboat team which consists of about 48 people.  So keeping that in mind, I will continue my review.  

When my group got there, we were served very fast and they took our orders.  Service from the waitresses was GREAT! 
Pros:

One great thing about this place is that they serve limitless CORNBREAD!  For a hungry team, this is amazing, especially before your food gets there.  

Now to the food.  The FOOD is great quality.  I loved the flavor of the ribs and bbq sauce.  The mac-n-cheese wasn't the best, but it was good.  I would say the spare-ribs were better than the beef ribs here.  
What was also nice was that they let us split checks which made it a lot easier for us to pay.  They waitresses also gave us complimentary doughnuts which is awesome.  

CONS:
When I went here, the portions of the meals weren't what we were expecting for the price.  A few of my teammates ordered the two rib meal and they didn't get much food.  We had to ask if there was a mistake because there was such little food for the price.  The manager(?) came and apologized and said they ran out of ribs?  I don't know exactly how valid this excuse is, but whatever.  I think that for an establishment such as this, it should have been a bit more prepared considering we did have reservations.  This is probably the reason why I am not giving them a full 5 stars.  I know the experience might have been different under different conditions.  Hopefully next time, our experience might be a bit better food quantity wise."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved our first time here since it was Bobby McGee's.  Taylor our server was quick and prepared to let us know why the change occurred. Very very impressed with the food. The manager stopped by our table to check on us and seemed very sincere.  Taylor was a superb server, attentive and very friendly. We actually talked about who and why would bring family and friends back asap."}
{"text":"BEST BRISKET IN ARIZONA.  I am a BBQ fanatic and extremely picky. Had the best from Texas to California, and have been let down by Arizona until I found this place. Only been going a year, I have my own Weber Smoky Mountain smoker and rarely eat BBQ out of the house.  This place, I can honestly say, makes better brisket than i am capable of at home no matter what I try.  Brine, inject, mop...nothing seems to hold a candle to Bobby Q.  Have an onion brick, Brisket and Doughnut holes and SMILE!"}
{"text":"Solid..YES GO HERE.. 

No 4 stars so quit asking for it...4-5 hard to deal out.  But, hey a (solid) 3 is on your way to the big time!

Great pulled pork.  Excellent brisket...good sausage.  I'm not a real fan of the sausage, however; seems to be smoky but that's just me.  Sides are great (beans, m&c, slaw are all we tried).    

Atmosphere is good.  Very busy with a young to middle age crowd.  Dance floor opens at 8PM on certain nights and that may (or may not) change the demographics.

Bobby McGees was great...this place is doing pretty good too!   But, let's keep this place a secret for now, OK?  

Highly recommended (shhhh, quiet...)  3.75 stars if I could swing it.  Waiters/esses wear no costumes (yet)."}
{"text":"The BEST BBQ I've tasted since we moved to Arizona! Pork ribs so tender the meat was falling off the bone, beef ribs so meaty you could make a meal of two unless you eat like me :). Pulled pork and brisket to cry over they are so tender & smokey. My wife said she would happily go back. She had the fried chicken and loved it, though next time gravy on the side. She did try my pork & brisket and loved them too. Bobby Q is a definite BBQ lovers restaurant. Service by Linzy 1980 was quite good she was patient as we made up our minds as to what we wanted and when I explained I had ordered baby backs & beef bones but was served St. Louis and baby backs she promptly went back to the kitchen and brought the beef bones, only having a satisfied customer on her mind. We will be back! Oh yeah the onion ring loaf excellent and one of the three sauces they serve is sure to please your taste buds."}
{"text":"Always a great place to get BBQ. We checked it out after they did catering for a GCU event, GO LOPES! Totally worth it. The food was amazing as usual. I love the taco appetizers and the mini donuts that  you take home. The brisket, pulled pork, bbq chicken, ribs, and kids meals are amazing. Will totally be back. Make sure to use your YELP discount too!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The staff are SUPER friendly and the food is delicious. I am originally form California, and wish they would have a Bobby Q's in the bay area. The cornbread is mouth watering, and their beer is delicious as are the ribs, mash potatoes, mac n cheese, grilled corn and apple cobbler. There were 4 of us, and we all shared each others food, as there was hearty portions offered. I advise you to do the same, so you can taste different dishes at once. I will definitely return, if I am back in Arizona. Our waitress Victoria was soooo friendly and nice! I absolutely also loved the ambiance and the restaurant is set up so you think you are in the south. LOVED it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ places in the area, great environment with great patio and nice homey feel. The place is been packed every time I have been so there is usually a bit of a wait and since the bar is a bit on the small side it can be hard to get a drink. 

The drinks a very delicious and there is a pretty good selection of mixed drinks, some wine and a small selection of local, I believe rotating beers. I had a Old Fashioned which was very good, not the best I have ever had but I'm pretty picky. Also a Mile High which was interesting but not sure if I would order again.

Make sure to come with an appetite as with most BBQ places it is going to be a good amount of food. 

The CORN SIDE WAS DELICIOUS!!! 

The rest was very good, I had a steak and some grilled veggies. Delicious.  The group I was with loved their meals as well and very little was left on the plates. 

All in all great place! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"back in town for spring training and we had to go back.
Alot of the time when you go back somewhere its never as good as the first time but not here. I ordred the brisket and its the best. The dont hide the meat with a gallon of sauce. they actually dont give you enough sauce. They dont need to because the meat is that good but most sauces are bad and you would actually want them to drence the meat with there sauce. Its hard to find great meat with great sauce. The mac n cheese was the best. good bread. I cant wait to go back to Phx to see family of course :-) This is also the place to be. came on a friday night and it took forever to get a table but the club/bar was jam packed."}
{"text":"Excellent first time meal here . Started off with the Q rolls and they were incredible. Main course was brisket, pulled pork, mc n cheese, garlic mashed potatoes, and cornbread. This is the best brisket I've ever had. Fork tender, juicy and delicious. The Mac and cheese was incredible with a hint of burned cheese in the top and super super creamy cheesey goodness inside. Garlic mashed had just the right amount of garlic. Pulled pork was also tender and delicious. Extra bbq sauce served in small pitchers in the table- spicy and regular. Our server was also excellent- quick, thorough, and professional. All in all a delicious meal and my out of town lunch guests even went back for dinner!! Delish corn bread too!! AND...we got a little bag of cinnamon sugar donuts to take with! Thanks, will def be back again and again."}
{"text":"I just had lunch at Bobby Q's.  The employees were very friendly and prompt.  I had a 2-meat platter with st louis ribs, spicy sausage, mac/cheese and roasted corn.  Everything was delicious, and they accepted the 10% coupon without even looking at it.  I only gave it 4 stars because even with the discount, it was double what the same meal would have cost me at a Texas BBQ place of equal quality. :P"}
{"text":"I would give the waiters 3 stars and the hostesses 2 stars ... but the food is too good to complain and rate this place any lower than 5 stars. I LOVE their cornbread and free donuts! It has a cool setup - a little more space would be nice though. The wait is always way too long and I always find myself shoulder to shoulder with other people. You have to squeeze past chairs just to get through and squeeze through people just to get to the hostess stand. Pretty annoying, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"What a find!  Being Southern, I was skeptical at first about finding good Southern food in Arizona.  We drove up and parked in the adjacent parking lot, and were surprised that the entrance was on the other side of the building!  But the rustic looking building was attractive on the outside, and when we entered we were surprised at how classy looking the inside was.  We were seated earlier than our 7:00 p.m. reservation on Open Table at comfortable booths that had movable banquettes on each side-- booths are sometimes a problem for me due to my size, but problem solved!  We of course had to order the local specialty draft, Bobby-Q's Amber Ale from Sonora Brewing, and we both enjoyed our pints, accompanied by sweet corn bread muffins, which my wife said were made from Jiffy mix, which we both love anyway.  We then selected the onion block, accompanied by a delicious Bobby-Q sauce for dipping, and we could not eat it all and brought about a third of it home.  Lightly battered and delicious.  We then chose to split the combination platter at the recommendation of our super friendly and attentive waiter, Jason, and he was so right because we even took part of that home too.  The one we chose had both of our favorites on it,  baby back ribs for me and fried catfish filet for my wife.  The catfish was perfect and savory, and the ribs fell off of the bones--honestly, I did not use my knife to separate them, just my fork.  For our sides we chose ranch beans, simmered with pork shreds and delish, and pecan cole slaw, which I don't eat but my wife wanted to try.  She liked the slaw, but the chopped pecans were just sprinkled on top and were not as good as those we have in Georgia.  Jason brought us a box for the leftover onion loaf and a rib, along with a short small brown bag, cut off and imprinted with \"THANK YOU\" on it, containing four little cute fried sugar donuts, a nice touch.  The manager came by near the end of our meal to ask how everything was, and we praised the food and Jason's service.  A beautiful night out and we felt like we were back in the South!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. The \"Perfect Hamburger\" was truly perfect and cooked to my specification. Price was $10 and included a side of fries ."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and this is a spectacular place for the drinks to be inexpensive and potent. my friends chipped in together and we bought a bottle. a woman jumped on top of a bouncer's shoulders and came out with a sparkling cake."}
{"text":"I liked everything but the rude hostess. Curt over the phone and couldn't care less about my question."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and we waited only 5 minutes without getting attended and when they attended us they felt that they made us wait too long and they took the initiative and gave us a free appetizer, and the food suggestions of the waiter and the manager were great, their service is really good and the food was amazing. Best BBQ I've had in the PHX area."}
{"text":"Best BBQ joint in the valley. The Q-Rolls were fantastic, I almost wish I had just gotten a couple orders of those for my meal. I split the choose two-meats (baby back ribs and beef brisket) and two sides (mac and cheese and corn) with my date which was a great deal and quite delicious."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to visit Bobby Q's for dinner on our last night of vacation in Phoenix.  It was dark when we headed out and their location put them about 8 miles away from our hotel.  As we headed into the area of town it is in, we began to worry that we had been given bad directions, but sure enough, past the high school here was this crazy, big building housing some of the best bar-b-que I've ever had.  It has a vast parking lot and as noted, is quite large.  Certainly larger than most bar-b-que joints I've been to.  We were greeted promptly and chose to eat in the bar area rather than wait 20 min for a table.  The fact that there was a wait at 7:00 PM on  a Thursday night again says something about how good this place is.  We were seated in a side by side booth near the bar, quite comfortable.  Patrick Buckley was our wait person, and should be teaching hospitality he was so good.  I had the baby back ribs and my wife had the \"Smoasted\" half chicken.  They started us with their amazing home made corn bread, and the meal came quickly behind.  Portions were good sized and the meal left us happy, happy, happy and waddling back to our hotel.  Although stuffed, we couldn't help ourselves and took an order of peach cobbler to go.  And, if that is not enough, before you leave they hand you bag of little home made sugar donuts they call \"Thank Q's\".  All of this and a full bar too.  I highly recommend going to Bobby Q's.  Take the drive, make the trip, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Remember Bobby McGee's? Well they changed with the times and now it's Bobby Q's. Crazy. Know what else?  They've done it right!

The building has been renovated to anopen country feel. The patios are awesome with great water features.  The seating is comfortable and the lighting is perfect with the setup. It's all. Well balanced. 

We started with the Q rolls because all the reviews on here said we should. Yep. Yelpers are right. Tasty!

Let me take just a brief moment to tell you about Caleb our waiter. What a great guy!  He gave us a run down of what's what with his cute helpful self. We came late, which can be a problem, and the service and staff were so friendly. 

Ok back to it...

Next was the wedge salad and yummy. Caleb (the rockstar) split it without us even asking.   the chunks of blue cheese and the crispness of the iceberg were awesome. You could hear the couch from the lettuce. The crispy onions on top were a bonus. 

We went with the massive meat platter and three sides. The beef ribs were massive and not stringy at all. As Caleb told us, all meat is cooked 22 hours or something.   The pork was shredded perfect with the right amount of BBQ sauce. The brisket, my favorite was sooo tender. Mmmm meat. 

We had the corn, mac and cheese and beans. I tried them all and felt they were all a great \"goes along with\" but mostly ate meat. 

What a great dinner out!  Great food, ambiance, and amazing staff.  Caleb thanks for being a great server and hope to have the pleasure of your service again."}
{"text":"We have been here several times love the atmosphere and wait staff is great Chelsea was awesome tonight. Just came in for happy hour and apps. Can't beat the price or service. Thanks see you soon. ....."}
{"text":"I love taking the guys at the end of the week to this place. Great food, beer. Good times..."}
{"text":"Came to Bobby Q. from word of mouth. Went to Phoenix for Spring Training. Went there on Sunday and got the Family fest (1/2 lb ribs, 1/2 lbs pull pork, 1/2 lb brisket, 1/2 chicken plus 2 sides) for $28.00. This is the best BBQ that i have tasted. The brisket can be cut with a fork and melts in your mouth. The chicken is not dry but moist (even the chicken breast). The one thing i do want to try is a 22-hour smoked prime rib....until next spring training, i will have to wait. Also, mention yelp and get 10% off your bill!!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing BBQ! It's a great atmosphere, they have delicious drinks and great service! You can make a reservation through yelp which made it so easy! I'm so glad we found this gem!"}
{"text":"I have got to say a friend brought a new resident last  night to welcome him to Az to your restruaunt. And I was shocked to find out  the way the bouncer treated him. I used to enjoy  Bobby Qs.  It is disappointing  that the bouncer would harass her very well dressed friend."}
{"text":"They got a dress code, a free drink signup, and some good ass drink deals. People seemed pretty cool and the drink girls are super sexy! :) ill be back some time or another."}
{"text":"Outstanding barbecue!  We came with a party of 8 (including 4 crazy teens) and all of us were very pleased with our dinners. Among us we had ribs, pulled pork, grilled salmon, hamburgers and more. Before the meal they brought us these amazing corn bread biscuits, and after the meal they brought these little deep fried cinnamon doughnuts.   Everything was superb. Great atmosphere.  Great service. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I was really concerned when we drove up and couldn't smell any BBQ smells. That is always a bad omen. 
Let's break down the good points, first. Very nice staff and clean restaurant. I would roll around naked in their cornbread and ask to be buried with the mac & cheese. The meat preparation of the ribs and the pulled pork was really nice.
However.
The sauce sucks. Both the regular and the spicy are thin and lack flavor. You can taste the ketchup in the sauce and little else. The onion brick was cold and greasy and the shoestring fries were limp and flavorless. This is the first time my husband has been to a bbq place and not basically licked his plate clean. He left over half of his brisket sandwich. Unheard of. 
The meal was pricey and mediocre. This is far from the best bbq."}
{"text":"Bobby Q in Phoenix deserves fifty stars, sixty even. This place is AUTHENTIC and FRESH. The barbecue is REAL and not microwaved. This experience at Bobby Q was the best one that I have had at a restaurant in Phoenix, in years. Taylor, the manager was PHENOMENAL. The absolute, hands down, most personable, nice, friendly, and understanding manager we have ever met. He chatted with us, made sure that we had everything we needed, and then retrieved a box and checked back in on us when we were finished. Our server, Mara, was so sweet, on top of our needs, and super friendly. She told us all about the restaurant and her great experiences with the team. I couldn't have asked for a better dinner to have had on date night with my husband. Keep rocking Bobby Q! And thank you Mara and Taylor. You both were the absolute best!"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend. Our waiter was being trained, but he did an excellent job! I got the pulled pork sandwich (minus the bun) with shoestring fries. My boyfriend got the sliced BBQ brisket sandwich with cole slaw. We both really enjoyed the BBQ meat. The BBQ was a very sweet (but not overly sweet), and delicious. The fries were amazing, but my boyfriend said the cole slaw was kind of dry and bland. They serve cornbread before the meal and it's extremely moist and good - wasn't blown away by any means, but it was your standard cornbread.

My boyfriend also ordered the frozen lemonade which was so amazingly good! If you've had the frozen lemonade cups at a ball game or something of the like - it tastes just like that except better! Comes with a sugar rim.

I'd definitely go here again. The only complaint I have is that it is small (they have outdoor seating, but when we went there were tons of bugs - ew!) and LOUD. Our table was also super wobbly. Only complaints though. Also, reasonably priced! My boyfriend and I escaped under $30 (not counting tip)."}
{"text":"Ohhhh where do I begin??? The weekend is usually a tough time for my wife and I. We scour Yelp! all day to find the perfect new place to go out to eat on a Saturday night. On this particular Saturday it was my turn to choose the spot. I was in the mood for BBQ, but was some what tired of the usual places on our list. Well then came Bobby Q's! Coming from the Surprise area it was an easy ride down Olive to Black Canyon Hwy. As stated several times already, the place is somewhat hard to spot as it i set back from the road with limited signage, but we made it into the lot on our second pass. It was about 6:30 and we didn't have reservations, but fear not! The wait we were told would only be about 20 minutes. The time came and went however no open table. The greeter apologized for the delay, but offered for us to wait in the VIP lounge for a drink and free onion block appetizer. We no sooner go our drink and the table was ready! Everything was moved over to our table and away were went to enjoy our dinner. The service was as good as it gets, A+! My wife went for the Smoasted Chicken with sides of baked potato, and roasted corn. I opted for the slow roasted beef brisket sandwich, and a side of mac and cheese. Once the server brought over the onion block, and corn bread we wee set. The onion block was fantastic and big enough for up to three people. The corn bread was perhaps the best I was had in all of Arizona! My wife rated her chicken dish an 8 and sides a 8 as well. When all was said and done...she was STUFFED! As for myself, the sandwich was just big enough to satisfy my apatite, and was delivered just as the menu stated! Deeeeelishous! As for the mac & cheese...have you ever had something so good it cold buckle your knees? Yeah, it was THAT good! No matter what you order from the menu, get a side of mac & cheese! As we finished up the owner himself came over to our table to see how our experience went. The OWNER! Not some manager, but the man himself! When all was said and done the bill came to just under $30. I did not order a Alcohol based drink, only Dr. Pepper, but they too looked top notch from those around us who indulged. Bottom line is this place is now my favorite BBQ spot in the valley, and given the chance it will be yours too!"}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum.  This was my first time and we made it count.  I ordered the beer collaboration with Thunder Canyon and it was great! From there had some of the Q Balls which were fantastic.  We got to meet the manager and had a great time with our server as well.  Thanks Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"Their BBQ is amazing. Tender, juicy, fatty, and tangy all in one bite. We got the sampler plate and tried a little bit of everything: beef ribs, baby back ribs, chicken... Their sides are decent, not impressive but not bad. Very good service overall. They also give you a bag of fresh donuts as desert. :)"}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! Thank you help for pointing us in this places direction. We were late for our reservation (that we made here on Yelp) but we were still immediately seated when we arrived. 

What we had

Q-Rolls: You have to get these. Crispy on the outside, tender flavorful brisket on the inside. Both dipping sauces were great. Literally waited maybe 3 minutes for them to come out. 

Full Baby Back Rib meal with mash potatoes and grilled veggies. My son was freaking out over how tender the ribs were. Falling off the bone. He said both sides we're good too. 

2 Meat Combo with Brisket and St Louis ribs. Everything was juicy. Ribs were falling off the bone. I only needed a fork to eat them. I had the Mac and cheese and the baked potato. I like my Mac and cheese more baked than creamy but the flavor was great. 

Apple cobbler was piping hot. The ice cream was melted in minutes. Not my favorite cobbler. I like mine with more crumble oaty topping but thats just me. 

The dessert donuts at the end we're perfects crispy and soft on the middle. 

Four thumbs up to our server Harlod (per the receipt) but I swore his name was Hal. He was so friendly, informative and quick to refill drinks. He also checked on us frequently. 

If we are ever back in Phoenix we will for sure eat here again. Tons better than any BBQ spot we're tried in San Diego."}
{"text":"The service super friendly. The food ample and delicious. I would have given this place a 4 because I am a California guy and I've been to plenty bbq places, but for what it was in a different state for me it's a 5. The ribs here are quite flavorful. the waitress I had was super friendly, although a little too chatty but I didn't mind. She improvised a cherry Pepsi with grenadine so a pretty resourceful crew and I like that."}
{"text":"Went there this evening and the food was delicious and the waiter was amazing!! Thank you"}
{"text":"It's pretty clear from all the reviews, meat loving barbeque aficionados really like Bobby Q's. 

This review is for my fellow vegetarians who for some reason end up here.   Why you say, would a vegetarian even end up here? Well, for one, to keep peace in the family, for the sides, and for my fave salad, a wedge of iceberg lettuce ( I can hear some of your groans, \"iceberg lettuce!\" \"What is she talking about\") with house made chunky blue cheese dressing.  This dressing is the best I've ever had -  I usually get a pint or so to take home. The grilled vegies are consistently good as are the baked potatoes and the corn bread.  The mac and cheese is rather average.  Prices are reasonable - portions on the large size.

The little donuts they send you home with are a nice/sweet way to end the meal - but not worth the calories.  

The wait staff are fun, friendly, efficient - the camaraderie has a good feel to it."}
{"text":"Really I'd still say this place is 3 1/2 stars but since you can't do that on yelp, 4 stars it is.  Came back with some girlfriends.  Still not the best BBQ but not bad either.  As tender as the ribs are, they still don't have that great smoky bbq taste within the meat that makes bbq REAL bbq.  We got the hog heaven meal so we had the baby back ribs, st louis, pulled pork and chicken with the potato salad and pecan slaw sides.  THe pecan cole slaw was good.  
Roasted corn side was not quite what I expected as I thought it was just that.  It was roasted some but was more like small slivers of corn on the cob on top of a bunch of corn kernals.  But the sauce was tasty - probably pure butter.
We also got the fish fry special.  The fish I have to say was done pretty well.  It was a crispy batter so it wasn't overly soggy with oil.  The fish (cod) was pretty fresh tasting.
This time the cornbread wasn't as soft which I liked better.
Tried their banana pudding dessert.  It was different than what I was expecting.  The pudding was a lot thicker than I would have liked but still tasty.  The crust though was yummy.  It was a walnut-like crumble.  Very similar tasting to the inside of baklava.
Still have yet to try their peach cobbler.  Will next time."}
{"text":"I got take out what I got was a pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and a order of calamari all of that for one shitty payment of $26 clams the sandwich size is a joke about as small as my pecker might want to rename that sandwich to \"a bun\" seriously where the hell is the meat? Now whatever pork I managed to find with a search party was in fact tender and has flavor. On to the potato salad I got to say it's good hearty chunks of potato. Finally the calamari ummm pass don't get it if you so tell them \"I'll have and order of disappointment please.\" This was my first time ordering from here and after this letdown it's hard to determine whether or not I'll come back."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!! Great pricing on Food! Wonderful costumer service and I love the experience I get when I'm there ! The food is amazing !!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from California. There are places in Cali that resturants call their selves the \"best\" BBQ. I stumbled on this place on Yelp and saw all these reviews. So I gave it a try. I do admit I'm picky with food because I love flavor on my food. And I can say my food was very good! I ordered the stuffed baked potato with brisket and side of Mac n cheese. My waiter later gave me some donuts. I do recommend this place! Don't forget the donuts so good and crispy! 

P.s. my waiter Scott was awesome! :)"}
{"text":"Good barbeque.  the steak was not good.  i got prime rib it was all grisly and could not even chew it.  my husband did not care for his steak either.  we also got dessert.  No good either.  death by chocolate was terrible.  cobbler not very good either.  everthing was ice cream.  need to add some variety."}
{"text":"Overall good food the chicken on the other hand needs work it was dry and clumped up in your mouth no matter how much barbecue sauce you put on it the service was good nice atmosphere would recommend"}
{"text":"By far, the best barbecue place I have ever been to.  We ordered the Whole Hog Heaven and we're in heaven with each bite.  The Mac and Cheese is excellent, the ST. Louis ribs are to die for and the service is excellent.  Look forward to my next trip to Phoenix so I can eat there."}
{"text":"Visited now a few times.  Great food and really good service.  The brisket is the best."}
{"text":"great bbq.
great service. great food all around.
been back here many times. maybe one of the best bbq ribs in phoenix."}
{"text":"Went to Booby Q this past week while on PHX for business.   The place was packed, yet we were able to get a couple of seats in the bar area.

Our server was relatively new there, but good and kept it lively.  We ordered and the food was out pretty quickly. 

For the price, I found the servings rather small, but very tasteful.  Quality competes with our local \"Phil;s BBQ\" on San Diego.

At the end, the server took the check and said \"let me get you some doughnuts.\"  We were like...WHAT?  The guy brings back a bag full of cinnamon sugared, hot, fresh doughnuts. They were awesome!!!

They have a doughnut machine behind the hostess stand and truly make fresh doughnuts on the spot!! I would go back, just for the doughnuts."}
{"text":"Yummy! We drove up here since the other place on top of this list (close to the university) was sold out. Worth the drive! Easily the best bbq I've had. Hubby and I shared the 2 rib platter (St.Louis and beef) with 2 sides - cole slaw and roasted corn. Fall-off-the bone meat, tender and moist, smoked but no overwhelming \"smoky\" taste, delicious corn bread that we asked for more! Our server, Carissa was fantastic. The manager on duty came to each table greeting customers. Top that!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times. Bobby Q has been and always will be one of my favorite restaurants. Not only is the food great and the service excellent but it's consistently great. Some restaurants are hit and miss, but not here. 

On my last visit, I ordered the southern fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and Mac n chz. As a southerner, I was admittedly skeptical about boneless fried chicken but it was delicious.  Usually I get a steak or BBQ, each of which are always delicious."}
{"text":"Went to Bobby Q tonight and really enjoyed it.  My partner and I started with house salads which were very fresh and tasty.  Then we shared the 3 meat sampler dinner and I am glad we shared, the portions are rather large.  Our dinner came with your choice of two sides.  We shared the baby back ribs, pulled pork and brisket; our sides were mac and cheese and beans. The cornbread and the doughnuts at the end were quite enjoyable.   Everything was delicious.  The great thing was that since we told them we were sharing, they split the dinner on two plates so we didn't have to do that at the table.  We decided to only eat half of our dinner so that we could order dessert.  The dessert was good but not anything really special.  We had the apple cobbler.  The menu said peach and I would have enjoyed that more.  It was good.  Overall our evening was very nice.  The service was amazing and the place has nice ambience.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service and fun ambiance = amazing dining experience. I have frequented Bobby Qs on several occasions for company dinners but had not dined with my husband. Over the weekend , my husband and stopped in and had a fantastic meal. We started with Q rolls, big hit! For entrees, we went with roasted chicken which was some of the best we have ever had and the fried chicken which was crispy but tender. The side dishes were all exceptional and ending the meal with warm mini donuts was a great way to end the meal. We do not live near Bobby Qs but this meal is worth the drive and we can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This place has some great bbq.  We had a large party and they accommodated us on short notice.  The cornbread was spectacular, the bbq was great and the donuts were a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. The service is great. It's a little pricey but that is to be expected"}
{"text":"I don't usually like to give a review after only having been to a place once but... I have never felt so welcome, so well treated, and so satisfyingly full after one visit!

I have definitely found my new favorite carnivorous dining place. 

My friend Don S. checked in here one day and I asked him if he was clubbing because I had been to the lounge with my cousins before but didn't know much about the restaurant since it had changed from Bobby McGee's back in the day. He laughed! Told me they have an amazing burger! Say what? Bobby Q is a five minute drive from my house! How did I not know this? 

I went last night with my son and let me tell you, one of the most pleasant dining experiences of my life! I ordered the smokehouse burger. It is 50 cents more than the regular burger and probably a hundred times better because it has bacon! Haha. I love my meat still pink in the middle and when I ask for something m.rare I would like it m.rare and preferably closer to the rare side. The chef hooked up my patty perfect! One of the best burger I have ever had! My little boy ordered the mac off the kids menu (love kids menus), and he loved it so much he ordered up a second helping! Sean our waiter was so kind and helpful and playful with the boy. It's so much more enjoyable when the staff is good with kids. Laura, who must have been management, came out to check on us mid meal and was also super sweet. She brought me out a sample of the brisket. Melty and delicious and bursting to the brim with flavor. She also told my son that if he tried the brisket she would bring him desert on the house! How cool is that?!? Of course he tried it, but more importantly he loved it! Then came.... Death by Chocolate! Its like an ice cream sandwich with brownie book ends! And so large that I only let Buddha tackle one part of it. 

I cannot wait to come back and try more off the menu! Oh did I mention that they give you free donuts at the end of your meal? I mean who can eat donuts after this kind of meal! But they are just as tasty the next morning! YUM!

So impressed!"}
{"text":"One word \"Awesomeness.\" The food is outstanding. Ribs fall off the bone, brisket so tender it shreds with the lightest touch, pulled chicken equally as tasty. The Mac-n-cheese and corn bread is phenomenal. Nothing but BBQ heaven. Can't wait for a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Love this place ! The Bbq  was amazing this is the second time I've been here we came up from Tucson  and I couldn't wait to come back with more family ! The food is amazing and the service . Thank you for the great food ! We will be back"}
{"text":"Brisket was better than average but not true Texas Smoked. Sides were good but not memorable. Manager seemed rushed, distracted. Prolly worked her way up from serving. She'll be effective in another year or 2. Servers and Barkeep were attentive and respectful. Hostess was exactly what is expected."}
{"text":"Upscale leather and wood steakhouse decor, was attractive and comfortable.
My sirloin steak sandwich was best tasting meat I've had in awhile. An unsliced tender and flavorful piece of meat.
The two servers, one a trainee, seemed to be tripping over each other. One dropped a big steak by my arm, then placed a new knife FACING me. Uurrrr, excuse me, that's not right.
Our comfy booth at the edge of the room was near a congregating place for servers, distracting to us diners. Doesn't mgmt notice this.
Young lady mgr asked about our experience, but her cool brusque manner said she wasn't really interested.
For the two of us, a hefty $68 lunch, granted it was a lot of food and was very good!
Just loved the complimentary cinnamon twists which is why we came in there in the first place!  Will pickup a couple of dozen for next breakfast potluck."}
{"text":"5 stars well deserved! Food was excellent. Our server Cameron was very attentive and explain to us the menu since it was our first time here. He recommend the 3 meat combo and everything was delicious! Mashed potatoes are very good and the ribs are the best! If you are a bread lover like me, you will loooveee their corn bread. It was so good I had to ask some more to take home! 
If you are in Phoenix you can't miss it. Go hungry because portions are generous."}
{"text":"On a road trip thru AZ we wanted some BBQ.. of course I got on yelp and found this place so we head in. It's a litter weird find and the parking lot is in the back of the restaurant. You walk in and it doesn't look like a typical BBQ place. Looks more like an upscale fine dining place. We got seated and was greater by the server who had to tell how good the restaurant is and all the awards and everything it's won.. I really don't care let the food do the talking.. I ordered the Texas ribs and they were huge and very good. The biggest down fall of this place is the prices. Seems liken your paying for the big huge fancy restaurant more then u are the food. That being said food was amazing there corn bread was very very good and the whole experience was very good just a little high priced IMO."}
{"text":"Great que.  I have lived in Oklahoma and Texas and Bobby Q is up there with the best of them."}
{"text":"Great Gluten Free choice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This place is on my Favorites list. Not only do they have amazing BBQ but they have real menu for Gluten Free options even though it includes nearly every item from the regular menu.  Server very knowledgeable and not afraid to go ask kitchen staff questions.  My family sampled almost every BBQ item on the menu and couldn't decide which was best.  And those that get Dairy and tried the Mac & Cheese you all who who posted are right they say it was the best as was the birthday desert i couldn't eat. Thanks anyway."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq spot easily the best bbq in the valley and excellent customer service as well.  I will definitely return"}
{"text":"We are from the Midwest and it's difficult to find good BBQ around here.  This is the best!  It is definitely a Midwest style BBQ.  Lots of parking behind the building.  The Hostess was sweet and knowledgable and let me look around the lounge area and told me about the dancing and crowd.  We got seated pretty quickly even though it seemed crowded.  We went on a Sunday about 130pm.  The Server (Dana) was great.  She said she had been there for 8 years.  They bring you corn bread to start.  It was really good and very moist.  We decided to order an appetizer since we hadn't been here before.  We ordered the wings 1/2 & 1/2.  They were both amazing but the BBQ was so good, next time I would order all BBQ.  We ordered the Half Hog platter to share.  It was the Sunday feature so it was only $31.99.  It came with ribs, brisket, chicken and pulled pork.  It was all wonderful!!  It was a lot of food.  It said it feeds 2-4 people.  It is definitely enough for 4 people.  It also comes with choice of 2 sides.  We got the mac & cheese and shoe string fries.  The mac & cheese was so creamy and delicious!  The fries were good too.  The only negative I have to say is that they serve Pepsi products.  We will be going back a couple times per month.  And I might go one night to try the Salsa dancing."}
{"text":"Shay was a wonderful server. She was very nice and took really good care of us. The pulled pork, brisket and baked potatoes was delicious. We really enjoyed the home beer and the Q-rolls appetizers.   The donuts at the end of the meal were a great touch to the end of the meal. By the way, the manager is also on top of everything making sure everyone is satisfied with the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Made the trip up the 17 to visit Bobby Q last night. I love me some good bbq, and had heard good things about Bobby Q, so it was time to give it a try. It being a summer Tuesday night the parking lot was busy, but not packed and we were seated right away. The restaurant itself was doing a good business. I enjoyed the interior. It was one of the most, dare I say, upscale bbq places I've frequented, though it's not upscale at all. 

Our server came by quickly and introduced herself. She asked if we had ever been there before and when we said no she got excited and told us all about the place. We each ordered a beer and decided what to order. We settled on the Whole Hog Heaven Feast to get a sample of a few things. Our Whole Hog included St. Louis & Baby Back Ribs along with brisket and sausage. For our sides we went with the ranch beans, corn, and mac n cheese. We weren't able to polish off the whole thing, but we came close. 

I must say that these were some of the best ribs I've had in a long time! They were perfectly cooked, easy to remove from the bone, but not fall off the bone, and amazingly the pork stayed together. I slightly preferred the baby backs. I wasn't as big of a fan of the brisket, but then again I am generally not a fan of brisket. To me, the best bbq is pork. The sausage was good, but I wouldn't go and order it as my dish. We got some of their spicy bbq sauce on the side and thought it had a good flavor. You could feel the heat, but it wasn't hot or overpowering and didn't linger. 

Of the sides we agreed the mac n cheese was the winner, though the beans were flavorful as well. The mac n cheese is certainly cheesy! Corn is corn. 

I know I really liked this place because as I was eating I swung my legs like a little kid who can't touch the ground with their feet. Signs of a happy camper. 

We are gluttons for punishment so we got some apple cobbler for dessert. It was good, but not memorable. Overall, the service here was wonderful and everyone made sure we were taken care of. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Bobby Q on the way to the airport from Sedona based on the Yelp reviews.  Once again, I was not let down.  It was a busy Sunday afternoon, but the service was great.  Hostess was friendly, food served efficiently and the waitress was great.  The interior is quite spacious and nice.

The prices are reasonable for the generous portions.  We had a sampler and everything was good.  Not great, but really good.  Overall I left happy.  If you are in the area and in the mood for barbecue, I don't think you can go wrong at Bobby Q."}
{"text":"amazing. every time. this review isn't even necessary. I'm just writing it anyways to add another five star review to the most epic bbq place in Arizona. I will never go anywhere else, I've been to six other \"amazing\" \"award winning\" bbq places in Phoenix and they don't hold a candle to Bobby Q. excellent staff!!! perfect food!!! love the atmosphere!! awesome drinks!!"}
{"text":"What more do you want? History? Been at that location for I don't know how long. Atmosphere? 1st rate of service? Nice people? Fun? Oh of course fantastic food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had heard about this place from a friend. In the past, we have always relied on ourselves to barbecue at home as Phoenix sucks when it comes to bbq restaurants. All I can say is WOW! We arrived early on a Saturday to avoid the crowds and were seated as soon as we walked in. Our server, Hal (Harold), explained the menu, answered all of our questions and was very attentive throughout our meal. We were very impressed with everything from start to finish and will definitely be back. There are a lot of awesome pictures of the Bobby Q's plates on yelp, and it all looks so good. Also noticed a great sense of teamwork and pride by the entire staff. That means the management is doing their job and doing it well!"}
{"text":"Simple bar atmosphere at night (pretty pricey). As for lunch/dinner - Good service. Amazing food. Perfect house beer. I've been here a million times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bbq place in town! I've never had a bad experience here. The service is always great and the food is just out of this world. Even the lemonade - the first time I ordered it, I thought they misheard me and thought I ordered a cocktail because of the sugar rim, but no. It's just delicious homemade lemonade, the best I've ever had. My favorite part is the fresh, hot, homemade donut holes they give you for free at the end of the meal - So delicious!"}
{"text":"The husband and I were on our way to Sedona the night of 3-3-2016 and decided to stop in this metropolis for food. Did a yelp and this restaurant popped up with very good ratings.  The place was packed and we had to wait about 25 mins, this was a good sign. Our server Michael was amazing, personable, warm, friendly and very helpful with our ordering and everything else.  We told Michael we were not going to have a fridge in our hotel room, so did not want leftovers.  He suggested we share a plate since the portions are large.  We ordered the beef ribs with mac and cheese and bar b q beans and an extra side of mac and cheese.  The mac n cheese was generous and creamy and cheesy, there was a cheddar flavor in there that just made you want to sing. The bar b q beans was so flavorful and plentiful and the beef ribs were smoky and tender and the bar b q sauce was to die for.    Renie came by as we were eating to make sure we were happy with our meal.  Nice classy touch, we were emphatic fans by then.  She also told us to save room for the complimentary fresh doughnuts to be delivered at the end of our meal.  Wow!  And they did not disappoint.  The doughnuts where so hot we had to be careful, this should be the ONLY way doughnuts ought to be served. Do not walk, run to this place, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The most moist and tender BBQ I have ever eaten.  They smoke for 18-24 hours and the ribs and the meats were excellent.  Also ate their award winning Macaroni and Cheese which was the best.  Cornbread is also served along with the meal making a great dinner.  Next time in Phoenix, I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"YUM!!! I would recommend this place if you are in the Phoenix area. My co-worker and I heard nothing but good things about it, so we decided to check it out.

Atmosphere: The exterior is quite deceiving. It looks like an old, big shack. The interior is gigantic and cozy. It is clean and organized. There's a pretty bar area, a doughnut station, and lots of tables. They have a separate area with another bar that I think is used for private parties or probably weekend nights. There were some cool decorations on the walls all over the place.

Service: It was great!!! Our server was so knowledgeable. She was friendly and personable, and she had fantastic, flawless makeup! Lol. A manager came by our table to see how we were doing during our meal. It added a nice touch knowing that they cared.

Food: Delicious! Cornbread? Yes! I ordered the grilled shrimp with macaroni and corn. The shrimp was cooked to perfection! And the seasoning was great. It was also great on the corn. I probably could've just eaten corn as a full meal and been happy. Hehehe. The macaroni was delicious, but it was as good as my mother-in-law's. Lol. My co- worker really enjoyed her meal - pulled pork and coleslaw. We split a dessert - the mud pie, and it was good, but we were hoping it'd be on par with the rest of the food. It wasn't, but it didn't take away from the meal. The best was probably the doughnuts!!! They give out free mini doughnuts. They are fresh and sooo wonderful!!! Don't forget them on your way out!"}
{"text":"They have gluten free barbecue that is loved by the whole family! We always get take-out so the little kids in the family can play when they are done.  Although we did eat at the restaurant a few times, they make fresh donuts that are not celiac safe.  I am sure they are amazing but I have to usher my son out before he cries from not getting a donut. The non-celiacs in the family loved the donuts just as much as the meal.

The staff is friendly and can answer questions about food ingredients which is greatly appreciated!"}
{"text":"Always a great BBQ at BobbyQ.   The brisket is so delicious - cannot wait to return!   Our group tried the ribs, pulled pork and brisket and we were one happy bunch!   Staff is friendly and efficient.  Will return again and again.  Love sitting outside in the winter!"}
{"text":"Ok I have to start off that I was initially going to give Bobby Q 3 stars until my wife filled out a Review and was responded promptly by the manager offering his apologies and a quick resolution. I was very impressed and changed my review to a 4. 

Ill start off with the decor of the restaurant. I really liked it and felt welcomed. It felt like a more upscale BBQ joint. 

We first ordered the Q rolls. These were simply amazing! They are brisket wrapped in tortilla then deep fried and accompanied by BBQ sauce and a chipotle mayo. 

We also got homemade corn bread while we waited for our entrée
. 
We then had a 3 meat combo.  We choose pork, brisket, and sausage. When it came to the actual BBQ I thought it was good, but not blown away great. I thought the sausage was over smoked and I'm not a fan of chopped brisket. I like my brisket cut into long pieces. The pulled pork was solid but again nothing blew me away.  I liked the man n cheese but honestly thought the garlic mash pataoes were a lil tasteless though. I added a lot of pepper to give them some taste. 

Overall Bobby's was a great place to eat. The service was outstanding, our server was Shay. The Q rolls were amazing and the food was solid. I really liked the personal customer service after my wife's review. So the only thing keeping me from a 5 star rating is the actual BBQ. I will give it another chance and would like to try the ribs this time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in town visiting and we couldn't resist trying Bobby Q. We came in and got sat quickly even though they were very busy, the service was wonderful and drinks were delicious! We got the Pineapple drink that's served in an actual pineapple (because why not). The food, we got \"The Whole Hog\", and boy was it delicious, my boyfriends favorite was the beef brisket and mine was the baby back ribs. WOW."}
{"text":"Good stuff, I came here yesterday for the first time in a long time.  I used to go to the club here years ago and it was always a good time.  However, I just came in for lunch and ordered a BBQ chicken sandwich which was about $10.  I got a side of spicy BBQ to go with it and man was it awesome.  Service was great, atmosphere is high end for the area with a dark modern look.  I will probably going back but after drink and a tip lunch ran me about $16."}
{"text":"So as a last meal in az this was pretty epic! Phenomenal service-I was checked on by several people, the food came out seriously fast. Best of all tony gave me good recommendations and made sure my meal was epic. I'm sorry to report he succeeded.

The food was fabulous. I got the 3 meat combo and of that the baby back ribs were my favorite. The chicken was fantastic and the beef brisket was great but hats off to anyone that can cook a pig that good! The grilled veggies were tastie and made me feel better about eating here. The beans were also great.

The sauces were also very tasty. I highly recommend the spicy to anyone who wants a zip to their sauce. All in all a great last meal in AZ before going back to Cali"}
{"text":"Not only was the service amazing, but so is the food. Ribs were fall off the bone, cornbread was so soooft, and the free donuts were amazing crispy goodness. The drinks also tasted like top of the line stuff."}
{"text":"From start to finish everything was superb (Q-rolls, cornbread, meat combo, apple cobbler and that complimentary mini donuts to go!). This is one of the few restaurants that I have dined in where the manager checks on the customers. Thanks for the recommendations and good service, Chelsea!"}
{"text":"Great vibes.  Did not disappoint.  Great BBQ Joint atmosphere.  Fresh mini donuts up front, open rotisserie grill in the and the ribs were all fall off the bone.

Gotta get \"the Whole Hog\".  Choice of 4 different meats and three solids.  Feeds 3-4.  All that for $50.  Great value for awesome food.  Per my 14 yr old son (the boy loves his ribs), this the the \"best ribs I have ever had\"."}
{"text":"I'm not crazy about BBQ so my review might be slightly biased. 

I got brisket because it seemed to be the most crazed about meat. I could see why people love it but it was just decent to me. Very tender but typical BBQ flavor. 

Mac and cheese tasted like what I've had at other BBQ restaurants but a bit better. Same with the corn bread. 

I got it for take-out and they were extremely quick so that was much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Here for the late night club and dancing. It's definitely a fun late night spot where cover is $15 per person. There are 2 different dance floors with DJ's. One is hip hop and the other is Latin. It's pretty crowded but fun. It must be noted that on the patio, they have \"Taqueria El Pariente\" that sells the Best \"carne asada tacos\" in town for just $3."}
{"text":"Oh man this place is amazing! My dad treated my family to dinner here for my birthday!!! I absolutely loved it!!! The service the food everything was so wonderful! This will be my new spot for bbq it's so delicious! We had the whole hog heaven oh man that's the best meal ever! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"What can I possibly have to say about a place with 1000+ reviews and a 4.5 star rating? Plenty. First of all,  if you're not from the area (like myself) this place may seem deceptive. Its in a bit of a lonely area and can be hard to miss if you're not sure what you're looking for. But once you make it, you will not be disappointed. This place definitely gets 5 stars for its service; everyone from the host, the bartenders, our server and even the manager were super friendly! We were seated very fast, despite being initially told we'd have an 1 hour plus wait (not complaining). Now, let me tell you about the food: AMAZING and food porn worthy! I had the prime rib and BBQ chicken combo with roasted corn, mac and cheese and a baked potato *drool* The prime rib was sooo tender and had a nice smokey taste to it (I wish I had the 14 oz instead of the 8oz). The bbq chicken was great. The roasted corn and mac and cheese, wow. Even our complimentary corn bread was mouthgasmic. Extra stars for the food coming out at lightning speed. OH, we'll be back FOR SURE."}
{"text":"Seriously the best bbq ever.  Come here from las Vegas just to eat! !!! It's the bomb can't go wrong with anything off the menu"}
{"text":"First time visit-read other reviews and decided to swing by. Dean our server recommended \"The Whole Hog\" and suggested the sides. He was spot on with his recommendations and his service and personality made our meal \"wicked good\". 

If you want good BBQ, put this place on your list and ask for Dean, he will take you to the promise land."}
{"text":"Baby back ribs were tasty, coleslaw was crunchy but not too soggy, mac and cheese was creamy and flavorful. Girlfriend's \"Perfect Burger\" was okay, but the fries were very good. The outdoor seating area was cool, and our server was friendly. Pricing was fair. I'd say give it a try!"}
{"text":"I am going to begin this by saying this may be the best BBQ I have EVER eaten.  No joke.  I had the smoked beef brisket and my two sides were mac and cheese, and shoestring fries.  They even had sweet iced tea which for me is a must for any respectable BBQ restaurant, the sweet tea was also great.

The brisket was cooked perfectly and the flavor was amazing, you could tell it was cooked properly over the hickory wood.  I've had Texas style brisket at about a dozen popular places in Houston and only one small place called Gatlin's comes close to the brisket at Bobby-Q.  The bbq sauce also had a good flavor, the mac was very cheesy and the fries were perfect for dipping in the original bbq sauce.  What else can I say about this place?...it was great.  I almost went here two nights in a row during my trip to Phoenix, went to Pizza Bianco on the second night and was not impressed.  I wish I would have gone to Bobby-Q the second night, I would have tried the sliced BBQ pork."}
{"text":"Talk about good ribs or bbq oh my they smoke there meat it tasts so delishious must give it a stop in try once you will be hooked"}
{"text":"The baby back ribs are amazing! Fall right off the bone. If I had one wish it would be they build another location in Scottsdale. The pulled pork is also amazing!"}
{"text":"OH Wowza polowza! How good was the combo platter! OMG! The baby back ribs were falling of the bone. And may I say the best corn bread all of us ever and I mean ever tasted. And our server Ashlen deserves a raise if she hasn't gotten one recently. She was such a sweetheart and always checking on us to see if we needed anything else. The wings were delicious as well. Thank you yelp   
People for voting this place with high honors. Already bought gift cards. And we will be regulars. The Mac and cheese is the bomb too! Oh so good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Nice bar area with TV available."}
{"text":"We split the 2 meat combo. Both the brisket and baby back ribs were flavorful and tender. The cornbread is delicious snd the side of corn was nice and smokey. Great food!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place I went in with my daughter and ordered some baby back ribs they were a bit fatty the flavor of the sauce was good but the meat in my opinion was just not worth the price maybe I just got a bad batch I don't know"}
{"text":"Sometimes I am annoyed with this Yelp rating system having only full stars. I want to give 3.5 stars. 
In any case, Bobby Q is a good BBQ place to go to in phx. Other than being in such a random location, the food is what you'd expect. I'm coming all the way from Gilbert and honestly there is one other BBQ spot in Gilbert, I'd also recommend.
I personally enjoy the ribs and fries at Bobby Q's though. I'm not a big fan of their pulled pork but that may just be me. I did like their mac and cheese and of course their check-in special! The little donuts at the end are also a nice treat.
The reason I am not giving them 4 stars is because my friend seemed to have gotten food poisoning after eating here. I am sure they keep things clean, but somehow something got through.
Again though, I'd still recommend this BBQ joint. Not too shabby, but not really WOW either."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the Phoenix area then Bobby-Q is your BBQ stop! This was my first experience here, but my co-workers ate here 3 out of the 4 nights we were in town! This is not an expensive joint by any means, but it is a \"nicer\" place than your road side BBQ stand, even nicer than the outer appearance of the building suggests. This building also hosts a trendy night club, which we did not visit.
The BBQ here was on point for sure! Everything from the brisket to the pulled pork and even the BBQ egg roll appetizer thingy's (thingy is the technical name) were all tasty and gone before they knew what happened!
On top of that the staff and facility were all top notch, helpful and cleanly!"}
{"text":"Mac & cheese was to die for! I thought their chicken was try. I loved their drinks! And the servers were nice. I can go back :-)"}
{"text":"Decided to try the baby back ribs again...and, this time they were delicious!  Maybe the last time we were there, the cook put a little too much rub on them.  But, this time, they were like I always remembered.  Everything was delicious!

Also, we had the BBQ chicken, and it's so amazingly juicy and flavorful.  Definitely the best BBQ chicken I've ever had.

Just felt like doing a follow-up, since I'd had an issue with the ribs before.  Glad to know it was just a one-off."}
{"text":"Brisket had no smoke flavor, was overcooked and soggy.  Vegetables were ok, dessert was the best part.  To-go dept, of which if they have a dedicated person, did not think to include anything to eat with, or napkins.   Worst BBQ on record."}
{"text":"WOW! This is definitely an authentic BBQ restaurant. Also, excellent service and nice atmosphere. Portions are generous."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great time at Bobby Q! We started with the Q rolls, cornbread then went with the baby backs and brisket...everything was excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"How the mighty have fallen...  I used to look forward to visiting this place - great food, good ambience.  After this last visit, my family and I are not going back.  I don't feel wanted as a customer because of my food allergies.  

I have gluten sensitivity and BBQ restaurants tend to be safer than most.  I'm a big fan of ribs.  Give me ribs, mashed potatoes & ice tea - and I'm content.  No special modifications required.  

Their gluten free menu looked like a child had done it.  It was very negative and I don't think it was accurate.  The waitress asked us if we wanted cornbread moments after she had brought us the gluten free menus, and brought us doughnuts at the end of our meal.  I've been there in the past and received excellent service, to the point where I was thinking of scheduling a banquet there.  The last two times, the service has been so meh,  I'd rather take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Extremely surprised with this place! To be honest I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did... Baby back ribs where oh so delicious! I'd absolutely recommend them 100%   - Also a must try is the tri-tip OMG to die for!!!! Mac & Cheese was also very flavorful! Its fathers day & the wait time was alittle over an hour Uuggghhhh but it was oh so worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place! Food was amazing and the drinks were worth the price. Took my mom and relatives for her birthday, and everyone enjoyed the atmosphere at Bobby Qs. Plus my my parents remember the original restaurant from many years ago in San Bernardino CA. Great restaurant !!! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything I've had has been absolutely delicious! Go see Sawyer she is an awesome server!! :) and dont forget to get the Mac n cheese! Best I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Review 5/10 for the 10 bookmarked businesses to review before the end of 2016! From Meagan B.'s thread: https://www.yelp.com/topic/phoenix-yelp-phoenixs-10-firsts-of-2016

Bobby Q's was on our way back from our weekend trip up north and it was around lunchtime so we figured we'd get something from there to go so we could eat it back at home. The menu was easy to browse through online. I called and placed an order for the three meat combo which would be ready in 15 minutes.

There are two areas in this restaurant. The front is for dining in while there is a separate back parking lot and take out entrance. Service at the counter was friendly and they even offered me a drink while my order was being put together. 

The smell of BBQ in the car was mouth watering as we drove back home. I ordered the combo with baby back ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. For sides I had the roasted corn and coleslaw. The meal also included 2 pieces of cornbread and they gave me some extra BBQ sauce.

All the meats were very tender with smoky flavor. My favorite of the three was probably the pulled pork, followed by the baby back ribs. The brisket was good and they included fatty and lean pieces, but the memory of the superb brisket from Little Miss BBQ still lingers in my memory as one of the best I've had.

The sides were excellent. The roasted corn also had some smoked flavor and the coleslaw was crisp, tangy and refreshing.

Overall it was a good meal and I do like how they have more convenient hours and better atmosphere than Little Miss BBQ. I will be back for more BBQ!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch during the work week. It is located not too far from my employer; however, I had never visited previously. Having lived in Atlanta for 12 years I enjoy barbecue, but have not found too many places in Phoenix that it well. My initial experience with Bobby Q was via catering at a work function. It was very good, especially for catered food and I added it to my mental list of places to try, but continually forgot to actually go. A few work friends were having a happy hour get-together and again I passed it up. Finally I went for lunch and was suddenly said that I have missed prior opportunities to go. 

I sat at a table in the bar area and the service was good. I had the sweet tea, which is a requisite for any good barbecue meal. The menu had several good looking items, but I went with the pulled chicken sandwich and a side of mac & cheese. The sandwich was excellent and I would put it right at the top of the Phoenix barbecue list. While the sandwich was great, the mac & cheese was phenomenal and I would rate it as the second best I have ever tried. I envisioned myself as David Blaine shackled into a phone booth filled with this mac & cheese and I had to eat my way out to survive. I win that battle my friend. I win that battle 9 times out of 10. And the doughnut things on the way out? Yes, please!

I will most definitely be back. I may go with the chicken again or try another tasty item from the menu, but whatever I get it will come with a side of mac & cheese."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ, good ambiance and great service. One of the best happy hours also... Love this place."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have had in my life. Took my wife and four kids there and all of us loved it! Great service and amazing food. Will be back!!!

Came back and it was just as good! Our waitress Jessica was amazing. Brought 2 friends and they thought the same!"}
{"text":"I am mixed on this one as a \"go to\" place for an every time college-parent-visiting-out-of-towner. We enjoyed the experience, but probably once tried once satisfied. This is your traditional, but unique, big-shack BBQ atmosphere with a donut twist. As you walk up, the smells are incredible and you are greeted by very friendly people. I ordered the 3 sampler of pork, brisket and sausage. The sausage was smoked to perfection - very good. The others seemed on par with any other good bbq sampling - not disappointed but not blown away. Certainly worth a four-star, but not tickled plenty as a 5 star - bbq rarely is. The problem is we ate a bunch, and It stays with you for a while. Advice is start small and come back often if you love bbq. The parting sugar donuts are a great benefit, but made with peanut oil so allergies beware. Too heavy to be a go-to spot every time."}
{"text":"I came year last August (late review...sorry) and I was SUPER impressed! The ambiance was much different from most BBQ joints. It was a bit on the sleek side which I liked very much. My hubby & I opted for the catfish po boy...(at a BBQ joint..go figure!) and that sucker was GOOD! I liked at the end of the meal they give you these wonderful little fresh donuts...Ahhh...be still my beating heart...When I go back to Phoenix, I'll be hitting up this place! One more thing... Location is a bit awkward. If You're headed to this restaurant & if it feels like you're lost.. You're not...it's in somewhat of a residential area."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, very attentive, and offered suggestions.  The food was delicious, I had chicken and my friend had ribs.  Both meals were prepared perfectly.

The atmosphere is really friendly and laid back.

Will definitely comeback on my next visit."}
{"text":"best BBQ ever!! this place is awesome, we are so glad one is opening near us in Mesa!!"}
{"text":"After 1100+ reviews this is merely me plugging and showing appreciation for this amazing BBQ restaurant.
I went in knowing exactly what I wanted and knowing that Friday will be very busy with a long wait.  I made a reservation on OpenTable which helped.
My suggestion is to stick to the ribs - or brisket if that's your BBQ of choice - but I highly recommend the full rack of ribs.  I'm sure the steaks and burgers are good, but if you want a steak you go to Dominick's; if you want a burger you go to In N Out; if you want ribs you go to this place.
They huge and tasty and come with 2 sides and they'll give you as much sauce as you want. 
Will we be back? Of course."}
{"text":"What can I say? 4.5 stars and over 1600 reviews. You figure it out, then go eat there. 

I recommend the whole hog heaven, share with another and STILL have leftovers to take home. 

Also, the fact that they give you freshly made donuts at the end of your meal...well, that just seals the deal."}
{"text":"Worst bbq in the state, even messed up simple lemonade.. tried them twice to be sure, will never go back again!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The mac and cheese was out of this world and the grilled shrimp were great. I don't even like ribs very much, but I tried my boyfriend's and they were so tasty."}
{"text":"Very worth the drive from where ever you are, this is probably the best BQQ restaurant in the valley. Brisket was tender and the Mac and cheese complemented the dish very well. There was a little bit of a wait but that comes expedited for such a popular place. Have family/friends in town definitely bring them here."}
{"text":"Best BBQ EVER!!! Everything was GREAT! Our waitress was Anne & she was cheerful & friendly! Will definitely recommend it to EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"Pretty good as usual. If you love bbq, this is where you go. We go here quite a lot. Oh and the Mac and cheese, to die for. Q-rolls are also a great option. I love that chipotle ranch they have."}
{"text":"Service: nice and very accommodating. This place is busy but they're organized. 

Food: so much to choose from. I got smoked brisket, Mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes. We started with Q rolls too. Great!! Brisket is tender. Get the spicy bbq sauce!

Environment/ambiance: very busy. We sat outside. It was so nice. It's pretty loud because it's so busy. 

Parking: lot, spacious."}
{"text":"I miss you everyday Bobby Q. I wish you were in riverside. Arizona is so far away but anytime I'm there you're my first stop. Never change."}
{"text":"So I just recently moved to Phoenix from Indy and after a day of shopping a friend suggested that we go get some BBQ, I'm not one that usually seeks out BBQ so I gave her a meh, but went along anyway and I'm glad I did.

If I were a bride at the altar and I was told I could never have Bobby Q ever again if I married the man in front of him I'd have to think twice before saying those vows as I'd question the sanity and ill intent of the Benedict Arnold standing before me. In short THIS PLACE IS FRIGGEN AWESOME!!! 

I was able to get a 3 meat platter for $25.00 and stingy is not something that resides in this place's vocabulary. I got more on one plate than I could for $25.00 at the grocery store and when they sat the behemoth of a plate before me I was full before I took a bite. The meat slides off the bone so you will need a fork...and a bib...and a belt extender. The flavor was fantastic from the sauce, to the meat, to the macaroni, to the corn bread, to the napkins, and to the free doughnuts after. The staff is super quick and friendly! I took food home and was really sad when the last of it was gone... So here I am here again on my second of what will be a lifetime of trips leaving a review as I wait to be seated, question is why are you still reading this and not here yet?  :-)"}
{"text":"I change my previous review of this plae. I went back against my wishes and despite my predesposition enjoyed everything tremendously. I still have my qualms with my previous experience with the lounge but have become a big fan of the restuarant!

The food was well done, and the wait staff was tremendously impressive."}
{"text":"I really like this place now I know it's one of the top 100 restaurants on Yelp brisket and pulled pork are really good the q rolls are a must if you come here."}
{"text":"Not as good as I hoped it would be or the reviews stated. I had brisket it was ok, beans not spectacular and coleslaw. Very friendly staff maybe just an off night. Will try again."}
{"text":"I lived in Australia for a year and Texas for a year so I like to think I know what good BBQ tastes like. This place definitely has it, and excellent service on top of it. The St. Louis ribs were perfectly tender and delicious, and the meat easily came off the bone. The cornbread was great too--I heard some ladies at the table next to me saying they really wanted more, and I would have too if I hadn't already stuffed myself to the point where I couldn't eat another bite. Our server Joey was very attentive and quick and he and the manager came by multiple times to check in on us, bring us wipes even though we hadn't asked for them (but we would definitely need them later on), ask us how the food tasted, and thank us for coming. In the end, they gave us some free donuts in a bag (because honestly, I could not take another bite of food). Overall really great lunch--I can see why they were rated one of the top 30 BBQ places in the country on Open Table!"}
{"text":"Husband and I came here for a date night and we had such an amazing server. I usually write down their names if the service is really great or is really bad but I didn't this time. I wish I would of! This server was on point and recommended some of the best dishes! We had lots of BBQ that was delicious. The ribs definitely were the best! One of my favorite reasons for coming to Bobby qs is the donuts for dessert."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! Not just the food either. Service was impeccable. The bartender, Jo, took care of us at a booth in the bar during happy hour and was superb. Not only was she incredibly friendly her knowledge of their menu was impressive!

While we sat inside due to the heat they do have a fantastic patio that I'm sure fills up quick during the patio friendly time of year. Inside there is a bar area which includes a few booths as well as a large open area restaurant. 

We shared their brisket quesadilla off of the HH menu. It was very large and quite tasty. Brisket was very tender. They make their own guacamole which is served along side the quesadillla along with salsa and a bbq sour cream.

I had the (award winning) Smokehouse burger and was not disappointed. It was very juicy and had great flavor to it. I'm not usually a fan of barbecue sauce on my burgers but this burger is definitely the exception! I chose the mac and cheese of my side and let me tell you, the best I've ever had! Don't tell my grandma I said that!  I'm talkin stick to your ribs good. I'm drooling right now just thinking about it.

They also give you fresh baked donuts in your way out as a thank you. Warm and delicious, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate my sisters birthday, everything was great. The service was fast we sat outside with the heaters so we didn't freeze too bad seeing as it's December. Can't really complain much about anything to be honest it was fun with the two dance floors one side is hip hop the other is latin music!"}
{"text":"The taste of the 8 oz sirloin I got here earned the 5. I got a side of their spicy bbq sauce (which it wasn't) to go along with it. 

Started the meal with the Cajun shrimp which was grilled jumbo shrimp in a beer sauce...delicious. 

Back to the steak. I got it with grilled veggies. The steak was probably the most delicious flavor I've ever had. Their grill has some amazing flavor on it. This piece of meat was cooked to perfection, and didn't need a thing. 

I had 2 glasses of Mondavi Cabernet, and with everything it was under $50. 

They ask you if you want dessert, and if you say no they give you a little bag of little sugary doughnuts."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place and they exceeded it in every way! The decor of the restaurant is very inviting, but the highlight was the BBQ!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Arizona, and best customer service. They really do go above and beyond to provide hospitality, and delicious fresh quality food. Wherever you are in Arizona it's worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"This place was so good! We ordered the dish that came with a combo of three meats and three side dishes. The meats we got were beef ribs, st.louis ribs, and sausage. I love beef ribs so much and restaurants don't always have them. Not only do they have beef ribs they are to die for. They are the best I've had in my life! They were incredibly tender and flavorful. The st.louis ribs were also super tender and flavorful. The sausage was good but, we probably should have got more ribs because those ribs are just so awesome. The atmosphere is very nice. The staff was very attentive and nice. Oh and the best part is that it is cheap. Our bill came out to like 50 bucks which is very good because I'm used to spending at least 70 at any BBQ restaurant."}
{"text":"Aleena was a fantastic server!  If this review were specifically for her, it would be a 5!  We were a party of 7 and she took really good care of us.  The atmosphere is nice, clean and comfortable.  The food was a disappointment considering the prices however.  Not a lot of flavor (has seasoning gone out of style?) and frankly the presentation was lacking as well.  So I waffled between a 3 and a 4 overall. Am going with a 4 only because our service was great."}
{"text":"Food good wait staff arrogant and in a hurry.  Had a drink that was in a dirty glass. They apologized went to bar and poured it in another glass and brought back.  Weird.  Noisy"}
{"text":"First time here. I came with my son & didn't know what to expect. Being that it's location is right off the I-17 we'd pass Bobby Q's many times & often thought it was a dive due to its location. We were pleasantly surprised as we walked in & were greeted by two friendly hostesses & a nice ambiance. Both my son & I were dressed casually. I looked around and noticed some guests were dressed up, while others were casual like us. I immediately felt comfortable.  It was a busy Sunday about 7:30pm. I requested a booth as I wanted to enjoy mother/son conversation over a nice dinner. The restaurant's interior is a rustic western theme with a bar in the middle, dining patio in front & separate dancing lounge connected to the back.  Everything was very clean and orderly like a well oiled machine. Our server was professional, friendly and quick. My son ordered the hamburger with cheddar cheese from the regular menu which came with shoestring fries & I ordered the Rib Eye with roasted corn and mashed potatoes. Both of our meals were prepared according to our liking and tasted sensational! Prior to our entrees, the server brought out 2 warm pieces of round cornbread with butter. It was delicious! We wish we would have saved room for the banana cream pie, next time for sure!  Towards the end of our dinner the manager came to ask how our dining experience was, it's nice to know this business cares about their guests!  One side note, the complimentary mini donuts that are given with your bill are awesome.  I highly recommend this establishment  (Excellent Food, Service, Family Atmosphere or perfect Date Night) & we look forward to celebrating my upcoming birthday here!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome! They have a giant blue drink to share...dont be fooled by the beautiful colors though ..it's not good nor is it strong so its a waste of the room in your belly trying to drink it all. Save the room for the delicious food :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Bobby Q's, I had  9 guests including myself with no reservation. The ladies up front greeted myself as well as everyone else and asked us to wait. We were seated in a timely fashion. The prices were EXTREMLEY overpriced for the crap food you get. The mashed potatoes and gravy were cold, and goopy, the macaroni and cheese was soupy. I took 1 bite and sent it back! The manager came over dressed in pajamas and UGH BOOTS on. The table where I sat was right in front of the kitchen and I saw her giving the staff as well as the guests dirty looks. She is was so unprofessionally dressed for a manager. The food was so over rated as well as our waitress who apparently feels it is acceptable to dress crappy too just like the example being set by her Manager. I got ONE re fill the entire time I was there and I had WATER !!! ugh, my bill for 5 people was $142.00 including gratuity. I would never go back !!   WAY OVER RATED !!"}
{"text":"This place rivals the Memphis rendezvous!!!  Some of the best BBQ, slaw and beans we have ever had!!
Impeccable service from the minute we walked in the door straight through to the end with our very satisfied bellys and tastebuds. And thank you Emmy for the wonderful service!!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up, kids! This place puts Arizona on the map for great barbecue. I ordered the three meat sampler-baby back ribs, tri-tip and chicken with ranch beans and veggies. Meat was so tender! And I'm one for Sweet bbq sauce, so I was dancing with each bite! Service matched the great quality food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town but very pleased with our choice.  Service was really top notch.  Great server, food out in 5 min, and tender meat.  The manager came by also to check on us with a great smile and attitude.

And the cornbread is to die for. Creative tasty craft cocktails."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had on the West... and I know my BBQ! Great service, portions, environment and food!"}
{"text":"I was excited after reading the reviews, but I was a little disappointed. I was looking more of a Little Miss BBQ real BBQ type of place. It is a beautiful restaurant inside I must say. 

I should've known I was in trouble when I asked the waitress if they had burnt ends and she had no idea what that was. I ordered ribs and brisket. The brisket was ALOT of fat, not what I was expecting. The meat with the brisket was good, just not enough of it. The ribs I'm sorry to say were not memorable. Sides were pretty good. 

I also ordered an appetizer. It came out after my entree arrived. They were kind enough to not charge me for the appetizer because of this. I have to say service was good but I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"I went to Bobby Q's for a family birthday on Saturday. The food was amazing and the service was excellent as well. I had the 2 meat entree bbq and spare ribs with Mac n chz and mashed potatoes. The meat fell off the bone. My friend doesn't eat pork and she agreed it was delicious! She had fried chicken along with others at the table who all raved about how delicious it was. The birthday boy received a double chocolate dessert and we all had freshly made donuts. They were both delicious. I give this place 5 stars. I wish I could remember the waiters name to give him kudos because you don't receive excellent service as he gave us these days. We showed our appreciation with extra gratuity. Thank you for a nice experience."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends after hiking the Grand Canyon and we wanted an epic dinner to celebrate finishing our adventure. It was an okay experience. I had the whole hog with baby back ribs, beef ribs, brisket, and pork. The pork and beef ribs were easily my favorite. The pork was tender and pulled apart easily, and the beef ribs were tender and savory. The brisket was a little dry. All together, it was a decent experience but nothing I would make a special trip for."}
{"text":"Great smokehouse food and side dishes.  Left happy.  Chicken and brisket are excellent."}
{"text":"phils san diego vs bobby q? i still choose phils always & 5eva.

BUT bobby q did have delicious corn bread and MINI DONUTS!!! Food was great, service was great. Can't complain :)"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. If you're visiting Phoenix Arizona, this is one of the GO TO places."}
{"text":"Okay I have to say this is my 2nd time here all the way from cali. I have received great service both times but this time I would like to give an exceptional call out to joe our sever. He was awesome. Many people can learn from him.  Management take notice Joe is that guy you want to have around all the time."}
{"text":"Amazing place to go! 
The food is fantastic and the bar is even better. 
The restaurant is such a family atmosphere I loved it! Not to mention the whole area just felt just right! 
The services there are so great it's worth going."}
{"text":"Corn bread and the ribs are awesome!! I agree with everyone here. The food are tasty. The customer service is even better. We went ahead and gave extra tip. The wait time on the weekend for high rating restaurant usually 1hr or more in bay area. I'm do happy that i do not have to wait. I got seated within 5 mins. Definitely will come back :D"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this please for years. They come every year for my birthday dinner with my family, and every year it is the same! We love this place and will always come back. This is by far the best barbeque you will ever find in Arizona through and through. The macaroni and cheese is heaven the cornbread is amazing the chicken, the fried chicken is out of this world! The barbeque pulled pork  is my all-time favourite and the perfect burger is exactly that! Just perfect! Order q rolls as an appetizer and the pineapple drink if you need a cocktail and please thank me later LOL!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is huge! I had no idea. We placed our order through take out and got to see the bustle in the back of the house and they were really on it. Seemed like they worked together well. The young man and young lady doing the take out orders were super nice and sweet. The food...well you already know....delicious"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Bobby Q...the first one was several years ago. I ordered a ribeye steak and it was tender and flavorful. For $25 I got the steak and two sides and I found it to be a great value for a $25 steak. It is a step up from Outback and Texas Roadhouse, but about the same price. I sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive and friendly. One of my sides was the mac and cheese and I can honestly say that it was some of the cheesiest, and therefore some of the best that I have had."}
{"text":"I came to Phoenix on business, I live in NY where there is truly great dinning and I have to say that Bobby Q's is the best BBQ I have ever had. I had the baby back ribs - which could be eaten with a knife and fork, but the BBQ sauce was so good, I had to clean the bones - they were amazing, the corn bread AMAZING!! Lindsay was our server and she was fantastic. So incredibly good, anytime I am in Phoenix I will def go to Bobby Q's. I am not leaving for a few days and intend on eating there one more time before I leave. Yum!! We also got 10% off our bill for saying yelp!! It would be worth double the price of what we paid without discount!!!"}
{"text":"Love the Brisket and Pulled Pork. Not to mention the sides here (Mashed Potatoes, Mac n Cheese, and Pecan Coleslaw are my personal favorites) compliment the meat very well. The cornbread and the chipotle ranch are also things I would recommend you try. In addition, the manager came around and introduced himself while making sure that everything was to our satisfaction. Love the attentiveness and professionalism displayed by the staff here. OH and the free donuts earned themselves an extra star :)"}
{"text":"Focus on quality of product delivered, not always timing to deliver! Half cooked and doughy pizza is not worth it.."}
{"text":"I literally left Bobby Q's last night thinking, I need to bring anyone and everyone I know from out of town here when they visit us.  Here's why:

Almost immediately after seating us at the booth at the bar (the wait was 50 minutes for a table vs immediate for the bar), the waitress showed up to greet us and get our drinks, and soon after brought us their oh-so-delicious cornbread.  We were set on the Whole Hog Heaven, which was a choice of 4 meats and 3 sides, but seeing that it was only me and my boyfriend. our waitress (I feel terrible for not remembering her name) suggested the Sunday special called the Family Platter which was for $33, you get a little less meat than the Whole Hog, 4 pre-chosen meats: chicken, brisket, pulled pork, and baby back ribs, and 2 sides.

Less than 10 minutes after placing our order, our food was here with an extra helping of spicy BBQ sauce.  It was marvelous.  The mac and cheese was the creamiest, cheesiest, most delicious mac and cheese my 10 year old self could ever ask for.  The shoestring fries were miserably thin, but I'm just biased being a fan of steak fries.  The brisket simply melts in your mouth.  The pulled pork does too, but only as much as pulled pork can.  The chicken was a lot better than I expected and I hate ordering BBQ chicken.  Oh but those ribs, the meat just fell right off the bone.  We were starving walking in, but stuffed after polishing off everything but the ribs.  My boyfriend, who had every intention of eating all of it right there and then, took a bite of the ribs, announced that we were going to take it home.  It was that good.  And that much food.  My only regret was not getting more cornbread.  But I can't really blame them for not offering considering how quickly they brought us that sheer amount of food.

In a nutshell, great, quick, and very accommodating service (the couple next to us wanted rotisserie chicken without any BBQ sauce.  Baffling, I know), delicious food, and tons of it!  But be sure to make a reservation.  Oh, and have I mentioned those cinnamon-dusted donut bites?  Bobby Q, you've ruined me forever.  I used to be very content with my after-dinner mints but now I'm going to have to demand donut bites everywhere I go."}
{"text":"Great food, crowded Friday night but were seated in 10 mins. Food price ranges from $ to $$$ perfect for everyone. Food was delicious great decor a must try!"}
{"text":"BOBBY Q BBQ. It's so clever! Honestly when we drove past this restaurant to get to our motel...we were busy making fun of their name. That is until we found out that they made Yelp's 100 Places to Eat and we found ourselves waiting 50 minutes for dinner. Not laughing anymore. I highly recommend making reservations because this restaurants get very crowded. Thankfully this did not affect the service at all! We were taken care of from the minute we walked in, to the minute we walked out. 

Their menu has a little bit of everything so you're bound to find something that interests you. We started our meal with their Spinach Artichoke Queso Dip (with garlic bread) but honestly you don't even have to! Their house corn bread is delicious with their butter and can easily count as an appetizer with all the free refills they give you. With that said, the artichoke queso dip was also quite tasty. I just prefer my artichoke dip with chips rather than bread. The bread was just a little too buttery for me which made the appetizer feel very heavy. For our entrees, we ordered the Three Meat Plate (brisket, sausage, ribs) and their Jumbo BBQ Potato (all the usual fixings and brisket.

We absolutely loved the BBQ here. We've tasted some of the best bbq in Texas and I have to say that you can find some of the best right here in Phoenix, AZ. Everything was tender, fall off the bone delicious. I especially loved their brisket and my husband thought their sausage was great. I loved their BBQ sauce too. I even liked their sides! Their Mac-n-Cheese was rich and decadent, their pecan coleslaw was tangy and refreshing and their roasted corn was a little too smoky but that is purely a personal preference (less smoke is better for me). As for my Jumbo Potato, it was stuffed to the brim with all the fixings and very satisfying. We were absolutely stuffed after this meal. 

Our meal ended with some fresh house made donuts covered in cinnamon sugar. It was a great finish and we really appreciated all the effort put into excellent customer service. The managers were all out and greeting guests as well as cleaning tables! That was really nice to see. Anyways, I never thought that I would find a good BBQ restaurant in Phoenix but I was wrong! Next time I'm here, I'm definitely coming back for some great food! 5/5"}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet. Love this place! We went whole hog, there will be awesome leftovers. Service was great, manager stored by to check. Loving this. Devil's Ale to boot. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, although the to go order is confusing and you get funneled to the back, which I wasn't prepared for."}
{"text":"We went to this location even though the Gilbert location was much closer. Food was good and overall service was good however we felt very rushed to finish our meal and conversation!! They tried to clear the plates before we were done. 4 different people came up to us to see if we needed anything else. I realize it was a Friday night but we were only there for a little over an hour."}
{"text":"Have been looking for a good steak house but usually settle for outback. This was my first of what will be many visits. The difference in same cut here that I get at outback is unreal. If I didn't know better there is no way I would think these were the same cut..night and day. perfectly prepared and seasoned and delivered by a friendly attentive staff.The sides were also good. The wedge actually loses to outback unfortunately but everything else was sooo good I could easily overlook that. We have found our new place for  red meat."}
{"text":"Not the best .. Not the worst ... Definitely quite pricy for the serving size you get ! Their mud pie was the best purchase !"}
{"text":"Loved it! We have been twice this past month. Both the pulled pork and ribs melt in your mouth. The atmosphere is wonderful and the kids loved it too. 
Zac was great and did great acknowledging my husband's birthday."}
{"text":"We ate dinner at Bobby Q based on their wonderful Yelp reviews.   We had Stacie as our server.   We wanted ribs and brisket.   Based on her recommendation we had a three meat combination plate - with brisket, St. Louis style ribs, and baby back ribs.   The best meat of the three was the baby back ribs.   The baby backs were cooked to perfection, with the meat falling off the bones.   The baby backs were delicious and wonderful.   The other meats - brisket and St. Louis Style ribs - were also very, very good.

The service was excellent - prompt, courteous, and attentive.   The atmosphere was very relaxing, and tables were spaced nicely so that we didn't feel cramped.   Stacie's service was excellent.

We will return here when we next visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"The Q Rolls were amazing, as were the baby back ribs and the sweet potato fries and shoestring fries! Will definitely be coming back. Tommy is the best waiter by far and went above and beyond to help us! 5 stars easy. 


Oh, and Chandler did it. He ate all his food."}
{"text":"This place has really good BBQ. I use to go here when I was younger..boy has it changed. It's clean, the service is good and the food was exceptional. Four stars because it's rather expensive. I have a hard time paying $12 for an adult beverage."}
{"text":"My husband had introduced me to this place and asked me \"Hun, wanna go try out this place called Bobby Q?\" and me, what? you mean \"BBQ\" and he says \"No, its called Bobby Q\" and were going back and forth with the correction of the name he's getting irritated with me and I'm getting irritated with him of his spelling! But, as we pull up and I see the sign it literally is called \"Bobby Q\" I got gonged!\" hahahahaha and apologized! 

This is the first place that I really enjoyed having some delicous BBQ style dishes. I've had before in Mesa at another place and that was great too because we ate it as family style. But, this is probably one of my favorite places in the valley of having some good ole' BBQ dishes with the macaroni cheese, yummy corn bread, baked bbq beans, coleslaw and their delicious sweet tea, which is something that I haven't really had before but, all was amazing.
I love as we were coming up to the restaurant you can almost smell the slow roasting smell through your car which gets you excited and more hungry as you park. I love the barn look and the atmosphere and everyone in here is so nice!
You really feel like you are in another state and the food it's so picture perfect that my family/friends back home their mouths are dropping because we don't have this back home an if we do, it is not the same.
The q-rolls with the brisket is one of my favorite appetizers to get and I heard it's something new they just added to their menu. I've never was fond of brisket because it always tasted so dry, but, Bobby Q's its amazing. The brisket is so juicy, slow roasted for at least 18-24 hrs daily, and taste of the bbq on it is simply just delicious! All their meats are soon tasty, I don't need to go to one of those fine dining restaurants anymore, I just rather be comfortable and enjoy their combo dishes or the HOG HAVEN and bring home the left overs to salivate later for next days lunch or dinner....

They also have these amazing donuts with cinnamon on it, to me it almost could pass for \"Malasada's\" its a portugese delicatessen desert dish...Same concept! Was soon ono! Happy place- Amazing food, customer service, and ambiance!"}
{"text":"2 words: MIND. BLOWN. Yes I said it. From their Cajun shrimp w/ toast to their BBQ rolls to their ribs, brisket, and sausage to their mini cinnamon donuts.. Bobby Q's knows how to do it right! Best BBQ hands down. If u don't stop here on your adventures through AZ.. all I can say is ?. The restaurant has a very comforting, family vibe and the smells when we walked in through the door we're a good sign of things to come.. Everything we ordered had a wonderful texture and their meat was fall off the bone good. I also love their spicy BBQ sauce. Our waitress was great. Parking is plentiful but there is a wait during peak dining times."}
{"text":"Was scrolling through Yelp to find a good place to eat in Phoenix. Stumbled upon Bobby-Q. 1000+ reviews with 4.5 stars??! YES PLEASE. Also, punny restaurant name? SOLD. Hahaha. Thank you yelp for showing me to this awesome gem during my short stay at Phoenix. 

Came in on Monday of Memorial Day weekend right when it opened so there was no line. PHEW. I guess it makes the experience much better when you don't have to wait in line right? Got seated quickly and the service was great! Our waiter (I wish I remember his name) answered all our questions and even gave us a little history of the restaurant as it was our first time there. Anyways, lets get to talking about the good stuff...THE FOOD. 

To be honest, I was already in love with this place when the complimentary corn bread came out. Free is one thing, but these corn bread were so moist and good! Between me and my friend, we ordered the whole hog heaven because we eat a lot and we were starving. We got the pulled pork, brisket, beef ribs, baby back ribs with a side of cole slaw, corn, and mac & cheese. The hog heaven only come with two sides, but you can pay about $2.00 for an extra side...worth. 

All the meat was delicious, although I wish the pulled pork and brisket had more sauce on them. My favorite is the pulled pork! Super easy to eat and literally melts in your mouth. The baby back ribs were good, but I feel like there wasn't enough meat and the meat didn't come off as easily as I hoped. The mac & cheese was BOMB, but my favorite was the corn. 

We also ordered a strawberry lemonade and that was delicious was well, and went really well with our food. 

And to end our wonderful experience, there was also complimentary donuts?! Sorry, but complimentary corn bread AND donuts? Can there be a place like this in LA please? Haha."}
{"text":"Very nice bartender and good selection of beers. Very nice hostess also, she even checks on you to see if everything is going well. I bought some of their tasty bbq sauce to go. I had the brisket nacho's which was excellent."}
{"text":"I have a rule of going twice to any restaurant, today was the second time I went and boy was it an abysmal experience. The first time was amazing. The ribs were great and the service was alright. I left feeling positive that I found a new favorite restaurant. Today was the polar opposite. I ordered the steak sandwich and it was horrendous. I don't know what it was about the flavor but it started to make me really really sick. So much so that I had to get up and go to the restroom because I felt that I was going to vomit. Thankfully I didn't, I stopped eating the steak, which if you take out the flavor issues, it was cooked properly, and the texture was spot on. 

Another thing which I found quite unprofessional was that the plate wasn't wiped.  It's not a huge deal but if you are a good restaurant you should show that when a costumer first sees the food. I got a mess of meat splatter and grease. I know it sounds trivial but the little things count. We eat with our eyes first, and it can totally change our experience from positive or negative. 

Am I going to go back? Maybe, $18 for a piece of steak, garlic bread, and mushrooms is a steep price to pay for something that makes me sick."}
{"text":"Very busy, very lively. Most of the experience was absolutely wonderful. Kept getting annoyed by a house fly in the patio, and the water feature noise, but quickly seated inside when I asked. The food was obviously delicious as you can see from other reviews. It was a bit pricey, but I was NOT visiting such a lovely restaurant without getting the steak. Worth every penny and the place was so charming I'd definitely go there for any occasion. 

Quick note: as I was leaving the manager asked how everything was, and handed me a small package which when I opened - when I got home - turned out to be the most delicious tiny doughnuts. From beginning to end a HUGE wow."}
{"text":"Ok was really excited to try this place. I ordered the brisket platter thinking it would be a better representation of what the beef is like as compared to the sandwich. Often times restaurants will use the crumbs or shavings for their sandwiches. My food was good but the 4 slices of beef were very very thin. I estimate it to have been a quarter of a pound of meat. For $21 I would think the portions would be a bit more. Brisket is better when cut greater than 1/4 inch. So this is why I am not giving it 5 Stars. The Mac and cheese was very good as well as the beans and corn bread."}
{"text":"Soooo good! The brisket appetizer was amazing! The service was fantastic and the Prime Rib was great! The best part was the Mac N Chz it was almost better than my own! Very impressed! And will be back again! My hubby loved the cornbread too!

I am soooo going back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"We were here earlier during this last MLB Spring Training, and didn't have reservations. It was too late to wait the one hour plus wait time. This time I planned ahead using OpenTable. After a long drive from Orange County, we arrive just in time for our 7:30 appointment. Our waitress Christin was awesome allowing us to sample things, so we knew exactly what we wanted to order. My wife and I had the Hog Heaven plate for 2 (or more!)... Baby back and St Louis ribs, beef brisket and chicken, and we even got to try the sausage. The meat was falling off the bone and was tender as could be. They didn't over do the barbecue sauce either. The cornbread muffins were tasty. The manager Barron was amazing as well... Thank you for comping the mudd pie to celebrate our son's birthday. We were constantly attended to. They definitely won over a customer for life. I will certainly be coming back next spring training."}
{"text":"A friend and I tried Bobby Q for the first time a few days ago. Reception could use some additional training in customer service. I had the two meat combo plate with brisket and baby-back ribs recommended by our server ALEXANDRA, WHO WAS AWESOME!! Meat was delicious, tender and juicy. My sides were Mac N Cheese & grilled veggies, both which were also great. My friend had the prime rib and shrimp, which were also cooked perfectly and he enjoyed them a lot. Dessert was apple cobbler, which was also well done. Overall, a good experience. Portions are ample, but so are the prices. Dinner for two with drinks and tip was $85."}
{"text":"Man this place is popular! But I can see why it's ranked top 100 restaurants in the nation by Yelp! We overheard it was an hour wait for walk ins, luckily we made reservations! The ambience was great, the lights were dimmed and there was this intimate vibe, but at the same time all these TVs by the bar were blasting the sports and games going on. 
Our waiter was great, very attentive. 
We ordered the baby back ribs and the prime rib. Both were perfect. The meat fell off the ribs cleanly and the steak was not too chewy, flavorful, and juicy! 
Would definitely recommend Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout here. I ordered the beef brisket dinner. It is absolutely the best barbecue I have ever tasted! I liked it so much, I am going back tomorrow for dinner. Absolutely a must visit whenever I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food. Huge portions. I was able to bring half of my combo home. Looking forward to going back soon. The beer selection was sufficient. I'm glad they had Green Flash on tap even if you could only get it in a pint."}
{"text":"Great BBQ joint with great service. Start with the Q-Rolls as an appetizer, they are reminiscent of mini-chimis with brisket. I highly recommend the Smoasted Chicken. The Mac n' Cheese is sinfully cheesy. The potato salad is equally delicious and surprisingly refreshing. The cornbread is warm and sweet. Then finish your meal with mini complimentary sugar donuts. 

Additionally, last year I bought a whole Turkey for Thanksgiving Day. Talk about amazing! This is the first time my family devours the a whole turkey. Delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Bobby Q! Always a must for dinner when we come into town! Service is great, food is great!"}
{"text":"Spent $100 (two people) and wasn't better than any other place we've spent that much money. We will try it again. Maybe a different result. 

Much rather go to Papas, Arrowhead Grill, or even Outback for spending $100.

I had prime rib and my gf had brisket/ribs. Wasn't raving yummy, but better than average.

Try it out though. Tons of great reviews."}
{"text":"This is our second time here.  This place was just as good as the last time we were here.  It started with our waiter Rishad.  He was nice and very quick.  He made sure we left the restaurant satisfied.  Even his manager came by to see if we were enjoying the experience.

The meal started with their Q-Rolls.  Seasoned beef brisket with a BBQ dipping sauce and a chipotle dip.  They are always great.

Aggie ordered Smoasted chicken (smoked. & roasted) with BBQ.  Her sides were Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  She enjoyed it very much.

I ordered Beef brisket with Ranch Beans and mashed potatoes.  It was very, very good.  I enjoyed every bit.  

Mikaela ordered the Kid's Cheeseburger with fries.  I took a bit of her cheeseburger, and the beef tasted better than anything from other burger places.  I couldn't believe it.  

To drink, Mikaela ordered their sweet tea (best I have tasted from any restaurant), and Aggie and I ordered Frosted Lemonades.  They were tart and sweet, and sugar coated the glass.  That was a nice touch.

We will definitely come back here.  It is just epic!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite restaurant of all times. If I were on death row, my last meal would be from here. If I were ever going to get married, I would  have them cater for me. I never went to Bobby McGees unfortunately, but I have been eating at Bobby Qs since it became Bobby Qs. I have never had a bad meal, nor have I seen anyone else not enjoy their meal. I have never had bad service, or even mediocre service. The food and service have always been excellent, above average, wonderful. 
I can't say how many times I have been here over the past many years. I used to go at least once a month as it was me and someones date restaurant for a long time. Every time someone visits from out of town, I bring them there. They always request to go back when they are visiting again. I've brought dates to this place, they have always loved it. When I talk to someone else about Bobby Qs, and they've had it in the past, they always say they love it too. I even met someone from out of town that said they go all over the country to eat BBQ and Bobby Qs had their favorite ribs of anywhere they've ever been to!  I've been to going away parties, birthday parties, tons of stuff, and I've still never met anyone to complain about this place. 
The only complaints I've ever heard is of the club. Who cares about the club? This is about the restaurant, the food, the service. Not some dance club where some teeny bopper got in a fight with her boyfriend so they had a bad night so they are going to complain about Bobby Qs. Come on now! 
Try the amazing, phenomenal food that Bobby Qs is!! The cornbread is great, the nice donuts they give you as you're leaving are delicious and the spicy bbq sauce is my favorite. I like that they sell their bbq sauce so I can have it at home too! It feels comfortable inside as well, the decor is nice. The outside patio is a great spot when the weather is nice. My dad lives 1800 miles away and is always asking me if I've eaten there recently and to take pictures of the outside water chains so he can replicate that at his house."}
{"text":"Fantastic barbecue and great setting. Good for the whole family. Large portions, great sauces and flavors, good service, and fantastic donuts. Have been coming here for years and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"A) this place is open on Sundays which apparently a lot of good lunch spots in Phoenix are not and B) this is one of the best BBQ joints I've ever been to! 

The BBQ brisket was tender and moist, my bf is from the south and was very impressed with the authentic Carolina BBQ sauce. The service was really above and beyond, at least 3 different staff members came to check up on us and everyone was SO friendly. (A certain resort in Sedona could learn from the people here!). 

The strawberry lemonade was super sweet and after you've stuffed yourself on delicious, moist BBQ, they give you 4 donuts in a bag with your check. Great idea because a bag of beignets certainly makes paying easier, though the food and service were so good, paying would never be a burden here. 

If you like BBQ, you MUST come here! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Awful, ghetto, and overpriced. I can't believe I've been there more than once. I wish my friends would stop making their parties there lol."}
{"text":"WOW, DELICIOUS!!! First I would like to compliment the host and our server Autumn, they were very polite and helpful and service was very attentive and in a timely manner. The wife and I decided to have lunch before our long drive home back to SO-CAL, she spotted the restaurant sign from the freeway and liked the clever lil Bobby Q name. So I yelped it and saw good reviews, so we gave it a try. The restaurant is not hard to find, it has nice size parking lot with lots of trees and shade. When you step out of the car you instantly get hit with the delicious smell of smoking BBQ! The building has that roadhouse feeling but a more family atmosphere,  the inside is very nice and clean, dim lit and once again very nice atmosphere.  I ordered my favorite BBQ dish, the pulled pork sandwich w/ mac n cheese as my side with a lemonade.  The wife had the beef brisket and the BBQ chicken with the pecan coleslaw and mashed potatoes as her side. While we waited for our meals they brought us some delicious corn bread that must have been freshly made, it was warm and sweet. So moist you could cut it with your fork and eat it like a pastry, leaving you wanting more after the last bite. Our food came shortly after we finished the cornbread so it had to be between 5-10mins from when we gave Autumn our orders. The smell was devine and the food presentation was very nice, not like your typical BBQ joints, it seemed a lil more fine dining, the quantities are more controlled , not just slapped on the plate in mass amounts. I first dipped into the mac n cheese and I'll tell you I could have stopped right there and not have tasted another thing and I would have left a happy customer, best mac n cheese I've ever had!!! Next I took a bite of my pulled pork sandwich and it did not disappoint. The bun it was served on was fresh and warm, the pork was succulent and smokey,  sauce was sweet and tangy which complimented the smoked pork.  The wife and i sampled eachothers food and every single bite was fresh, succulent, savory and absolutely delicious.  Hands down the best BBQ I have ever eaten!!! The only thing I can complain about is we don't have a Bobby Q's over here where I live in Diamond bar, California.
P.S. 
My wife says, she thinks there should be a Barbie Q in California, we will have to make Phoenix a regular trip until then though."}
{"text":"Great BBQ,  good flavor, great lunch prices.  Both brisket and baby back ribs are so tender and delicious. Very good service.  Manager goes around asking if everything is ok. Nicole provided exceptional service."}
{"text":"Get the Ribs! So while visiting Phoenix on business our group of 7 hungry diners wanted something substantial and memorable for our out of town experience. BOBBY'Qs, did not disappoint. I had originally ordered the brisket, but due to an error from the kitchen I ended up with ribs. The only regret I have now is I live so far from Phoenix. Nothing will compare. And I consider myself a rib aficionado. \"Hunter\" our server was knowledgeable, efficient and attentive. He told us the brisket  meat was cooked 22 hours. I tried my friends, and it was delicious. Even the side dishes were noteworthy. My favorite was the potato salad. A bit on the creamy side, but just the way I like it. Not an inexpensive dinner, but one that you won't soon forget. I can taste it now.l as I write this."}
{"text":"I guess you'll love this place if you're a heavy flesh eater that eats just about anything covered in sauce.  But for someone who saves their palate for quality meat, I would recommend saving your money.  The bright side, is that you'll get a choice of sauces, but other than that the food is not memorable.  I have not been back after finding red jelly (I suppose that it was congealed blood from a chicken that was too young - I'm not exactly sure) on the joints of the bones."}
{"text":"Hands down, it is the best barbecue restaurant I have ever been at. We were a party of six, and we ordered many different kinds of food and shared it all. The catfish was our least favorite dish. However, everything else was beyond amazing. We all agreed that the corn, mac and cheese, and cornbread were the best things ever ... Personally, I think their mac and cheese is the best mac and cheese dishes on earth :)"}
{"text":"Not all barbecue is created equally. I'm from Chicago and grew up eating barbecue NOT pulled porked sandwiches or beef brisket, but pork barbecue ribs & rib tips from the south side of Chicago. Ya know, the kind where white bread and french fries are saturated in sauce at the bottom of the basket. Where you have to work a little bit to pull the meat off the bone. Where you smell the charred ribs a few blocks away. Now that's barbecue to me.

This does not mean that I cannot appreciate other types of barbecue. We spilt the pulled pork sandwich and slab of ribs. It was good, but I packed the leftovers for my husband's lunch today. When something is really good I don't share and sadly, the ribs we just okay. 

I gave an extra star for the customer service. The hostess and waitress were polite, attentive and nice. Too bad more establishments are not as well run as Bobby Q."}
{"text":"It's no surprise that this place is as popular as it is! The food, the service is just what you want! We found Bobby Qs on Yelp and decided that it would be a fun and yummy place for dinner. We had made reservations in advance so we were seating as soon as we checked in. I had the brisket, which is melt in your mouth soooo delicious. My cousin had the loaded potato which was definitely loaded to the max! And my other cousins shared a combination plate which had more than enough food to feed two! They even had some leftover to take home! My fiance had the steak sandwich, which was good, but wasn't our favorite. The steak was not as tender as we'd like it to be. But our server, Jason F, went out of his way to make sure that we loved our food and made the situation much better. Honestly, even if the food was bad (which it wasn't!) I would have come back just for the service alone! We can't wait to head back!"}
{"text":"Well worth the trip!! We shared the combination platter - pork ribs, brisket, and pork. Amazing!! Thanks to our server, Loralie!!!"}
{"text":"Food is pricey but well done. The cocktails, meat sides and even the little donuts you get for the ride home are all amazing."}
{"text":"So, the bf and I are in Phoenix for the weekend and looking for a good steakhouse.  All I'm able to find is a Lone Star, Black Angus, and Outback Steakhouse.  Boo.  I notice the Bobby Q off the I-17 and look it up on Yelp.  Pretty good reviews, and they serve steak!  So off we go.

What we ordered:
Strawberry Qlada & Mudslide on the Rocks
Q-Rolls
Wedge Salad
Ribeye Steak (with cole slaw and potato salad)
Prime Rib with Shrimp Chimichurri (with roasted corn and ranch beans)

My Strawberry Qlada was delicious (I like the coconut on the rim of the glass), but the mudslide was missing an ingredient (easily fixed).  The Q-Rolls weren't anything spectacular, but they did taste good.  We shared the wedge salad, which they split it for us and I was thankful!  It was enough as a starter, and it was also very good.  

The ribeye was amazing!  When it arrived, the bf asked for steak sauce, but after taking a bite of the steak, he decided that the steak sauce was not necessary.  It was so juicy and flavorful, I was a little disappointed I didn't order it for myself.  However, my prime rib was also juicy (not as thick a cut as Lawry's, but pretty good anyway!) and the shrimp was also nice addition.  The sides were all very good, but I loved my roasted corn the best!  

I realized there were two things missing from our dinners after we left the restaurant.  The ribeye should have come with cornbread and the prime rib should have come with a jumbo baked potato.  I don't think I could have eaten the potato, but I would have liked to have tasted that cornbread.

Our server, Smitty, was EXCELLENT.  He was friendly and attentive, and he made sure we were well taken care of.  He definitely made our overall dining experience a positive one.

We'll definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We came to Bobby Q off of the recommendation of a friend and we were definitely not disappointed! The food was super good, the service was great, and the restaurant looked very clean and nice. 

We came at around 12pm and there wasn't a line, and we were seated at a large table. The waitresses were very nice, and brought us water once we sat down. We saw the fresh mini donuts being made near the front of the door and they kindly gave us some before our meal; the donuts were dusted with cinnamon sugar and they were delicious! The donuts were soft, warm, and perfectly fried. After the donuts, we decided on the Whole Hog, which was quite a lot of food for three girls. The whole hog came with St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, three sides (which we ordered shoe string fries, mashed potatoes, and corn), BBQ chicken, and brisket, as well as cornbread. The cornbread was buttery and delicious, and it tasted great with the whipped butter. The bbq was honestly the best I have yet to have! The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, and the meat had a good fat-to-meat ratio. Of the meats, my favorite was the smokey St. Louis ribs, which were less saucy and contained chewy tendons (if you're into that like I am). The mashed potatoes was also super buttery and smooth, and tasted almost like a dip. Also, the waitress brought two pitchers of BBQ sauce, one spicy and one original, so be prepared to drench all the meat in even more sauce. 

After the meal, the waitress was super kind and brought us another round of donuts! 

I would highly recommend this place if you're in Phoenix! The food was amazing, the staff was super friendly, and the sides and donuts make this place stand out."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed the Whole Hog Heaven!! We didn't get to finish our meal because it was that large of a portion!  We arrived hungry and now leaving with left overs.  I really enjoyed the service from our Waiter, genuine and prompt!  I'll come back, quality flavors of smoked and caramelized ribs!!!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent food is great the managers Taylor and baron  have absolutely the best customer service I live in Las Vegas and when I'm in town I eat there at least 3 times"}
{"text":"Loved the place! Went there to celebrate with family..... The whole hog was amazing! Brisket and ribs! Cornbread and little donuts! Fantastic!! Our server, Patrick was awesome! We'll be back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had such good food here tonight, holy cow!  I came here at the last minute because I was stuck in the house all day today, and needed to get out and eat something.  I decided to come here, and even though it's not my first time, it's probably the best BBQ I've had in a while.

When I first moved here, I used to drive by this place a lot, but being that I lived on the East side for many years, I was to lazy to come here since it was .  Boy, what a to far!

Man, this place was packed tonight!  I had to circle the parking lot like twice just to get a parking space! once inside, I was seated almost immediately at the bar.  After looking over the menu, I went with the Brisket sandwich with mashed potatoes. It came out right away, and man, was it good! 

Service was awesome, especially since it was so busy. The bathrooms were pretty cool with big steel sinks and pretty hand soap containers. I will say, I don't get the club thing attached to Bobby Q's, but there was a ton of people in there. I noticed it when I came in, but saw a lot of people in there when I went to the restroom.  They had a sign up with a dress code, and I'm not real sure what that's about, but seemed interesting enough."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite places.  The quality is excellent and I've never left hungry.

My favorites here include the brisket, baked potato soup, prime rib sandwich (occasional lunch special), mac 'n cheese and mashed potatoes.  No, not all at once though.  :)

I love to get the soup and sandwich lunch special and actually put my brisket in the baked potato soup.  I also like to order the brisket sandwich with mac 'n cheese and do the same thing.

The cornbread they serve is delicious and makes a great appetizer.  My only disappointment here is that when I first started coming here you got fresh from the fryer cinnamon mini doughnuts at the end of your meal.  Now, they're never fresh and you only get them sometimes."}
{"text":"YES! Got the baby back ribs and the meat just falls right off the bones."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way to the PHX airport. Management is really active and always checking on us. The server was also great and tried really hard. The food was not good, and the prices are high for what you get. It smelled great from outside but unfortunately have had much better BBQ in Phoenix. The doughnuts for dessert are delicious! Might try them again next time we are in town, maybe just an off night."}
{"text":"This is probably best barbecue I've ever had. The corn bread is amazing. I got the St. Louis ribs, they wee fall of the bone. I got the Mac and cheese as a side. Every thing was great.  All the people working there were very friendly."}
{"text":"Out with two buds tonight on a quest for some good BBQ and to zap a few other cravings. I've been here one or two times before but for whatever reason was never able to try a lot of things.

First off I love the atmosphere and decor of the place. Upscale bayou? can that exist? seems like they were able to do it. Plus its nice and dark and comfortable.

One thing I recall is how great the service is EVERY TIME i go. Three different visits.. three different servers.. top notch each time.

Food!

Appetizers

Wings:
Delicious! These are smoked, fried, and then sauced. I hate(strong word on purpose) baked wings. I thought I was going to hate these but the combo of the smoked then fried works amazingly. It allows them to only flash fry for crisp. This keeps the wings juicy and plump but with the fried crispy skin that wings should have.

Brisket Fire-Pie:
Don't bother :/ I knew this was risky but I had a pizza craving. Normally BBQ pizzas have way to much BBQ sauce. This was the opposite it had very little sauce.. so little that it had no flavor impact leaving you wondering what that funky after taste is.

Cornbread:
Strong corn flavor.. not overly sweet. Could feel the grease/butter levels killing me not so slowly. But was good to the taste buds.
-----------------
BBQ

Pulled Pork:
Nice smoke flavor and good moisture content without being overly fatty. Not the best I've had but no complaints.

Brisket:
Same feelings as the pork. It was good and executed properly but certainly not the best I've ever had. None of the BBQ was overly salty but some of it was to far on the other end of the scope and could have used some more salt. There was no real bark on the brisket which was a little disappointing.

Smoke Links:
I didn't care for these at all. They were to fatty for my taste and needed more... something in your face. I think everyone agreed these were the our least favorite items.

Baby Back Ribs:
Very tasty ribs but surprisingly not my favorite out of the three offered. These are usually the safe best for best ribs at whatever place your at. There was something out of whack with the meat itself. It failed to really pick up the smoke flavor maybe? They were moist and tender and fall off the bone. But fall off the bone on the side of smoked to long.

Beef Ribs:
Surprisingly lean for beef ribs. Since they were so lean these could have used a little more time in the smoke unlike the baby backs. Beef ribs take a much longer time to break down to perfection.

St Louis Style Ribs:
YUM! Best ribs on the menu. Next time this is all I will order in the rib category. Flavor was great., meat was great., still a little over done but it took nothing away from them. I would come back for this alone.
-------------------

Sides

Mac & Cheese:
Delicious but they went the fake cheese route. It is hard to make good mac and cheese the old fashion way. Its hard in small quantity let alone restaurant quantity. I would rather have them understand this and serve it with primarily fake cheese and be tasty then try and do from scratch and serve me curdled cheese fail.

Pecan Cole Slaw:
Also sexy! Crisp, cold, refreshing, and not soggy. The nuts were a nice addition but if they could have somehow brought it out more in the dish it would have been ever better.

Potato Salad:
Mmmmmm. This was great and a tie for best side dish with the mac and cheese. Be warned.. This is HEAVY. Its probably 90% mayo but its potato salad.. its not healthy don't try and make it healthy. They did it right. It took a year off my life and I loved every bite of it. Its the bad years anyway! Creamy, perfect amount of mustard, great seasoning, lots of fresh dill.

Beans:
Interesting.. Sweet but not grossly sweet like some. Smokey but almost to a crazy level. When I tasted this I honestly felt like I was eating something with a liquid tobacco smoke flavor. It also had a lot of what was probably the BBQ beef in it. Not sure what I thought about this.

Planned Return Order:
Wings
St Louis Ribs
Mac & Cheese
Potato Salad
Pecan Coleslaw

Get these if nothing else and I would be shocked if you didn't leave grinning ear to ear.

Pros:
Great Service
Great Atmospheric
Acceptable Great to OK dish ratio
10% off for yelpsters!

Cons:
Awkward Location
Awkward Parking
Pricey

For those still stumped by the \"how can fall off the bone be bad\" the best test for ribs done correctly would be ribs tender enough to pull apart with your teeth but ones you can pick up and hold by a bone and not have fall apart. If you pick up ribs by the bone and the meat stays on the plate and the bone comes up clean its been neglected. I know this sounds crazy to most but when you have enough ribs done properly you will taste and appreciate a rib that was on as long as it was supposed to be and no longer."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best BBQ restaurants I have ever ate at. Do your self a favor and go."}
{"text":"Out of all the bbq restaurants in Phoenix, this one by far is the best one I have been to.  My boyfriend and I are from KC and, of course, claim to know bbq.  Bobby Q's isn't as good as some of my favorites around the country, but for Phoenix, I give it an A+.

Many of the establishments in town have ok meat, but horrible sides.  Bobby Q was great all around!  From the corn bread, to the bbq sandwiches and finally the mini-donuts for dessert (that were even hot) everything was fantastic.  

The venue is a bit more upscale than most bbq joints and the parking lot and restaurant itself are gigantic.  Don't worry about getting a spot on a week night, there is plenty of room!"}
{"text":"Called in for take out, they said be there in 15 min, waited 45 min in their sweaty kitchen and then got a whole $5 coupon!!!  Thanks!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great service. Sunday family special is such a huge value! Don't miss that Mac n cheese or the adult strawberry lemonade. Go here!"}
{"text":"Our family has loved Bobby Q ever since we moved here from Tennessee. The food and the service are great and the atmosphere is something you don't always find in AZ. We love it! Best fried chicken and BBQ in AZ."}
{"text":"Off the charts. Don't know where to start!  Well first of all the service was was fantastic. So inviting and like you were at a good relatives house!  Hostess, server and manager all present and attentive. Then there is the food. We split baby backs with an onion block. Too yummy to describe. Ribs came with two sides and a choice of spicy or regular. Spicy was just right. We finished with complementary Mimi home made donuts that you see being made as you come in the door. There were 2 in our party and I think we are taking over half of our lunch. Oh and did I say come hungry!  This is a do over and bring back hungry friends."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner.  The atmosphere was great and there were many good smells wafting through the room.  We had several questions for the waitress regarding use of soy as an ingredient or cooking oil.  She had to keep going away to ask and the answers coming back were vague and not very helpful.  Not acceptable in these times.  Many people don't care, but soy is an allergen and one of our group has an intolerance.  We expect better of highly rated restaurants than to use soy as the cheap go-to ingredient in most of their menu.  Barbecue sauces can be made from real ingredients like cane sugar, tomatoes, vinegar, spices etc...   Ingredients like soy and corn syrup are a cheap sellout in my view.  With better ingredients and staff training this could be a really good restaurant.  If soy doesn't bother you, go for it.  The fresh donuts at the end are a great touch (soy there too)."}
{"text":"A few of us from work arrived from the airport around 8; one of them had been here before and decided to take us for dinner.

What I liked:
-loved the cornbread!!!
-3 meat plate, great mix of chicken, ribs, and brisket. Ribs were nice, tender meat off the bone, great sauce and pit-smoked; excellent value for 20 bux!, 
-loved the roasted corn as a side
-unique dessert, complimentary mini donuts
-young staff, very friendly; for single guys, some of the staff are eye candy

Why no fifth star:
-the server, albeit friendly, did forget our wine orders, so I had to knock a star off.

Great BBQ place, excellent food and good value. There's a Q lounge next door, so will definitely stop by the next time I'm in PHX. Wasn't sure if I was in the meat mood, but BOBBY Q satisfied by BBQ fix!!!"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to have dinner here...even though she doesn't eat meat, but that just means more meat for me.

I can understand why this restaurant is rated the top 100 bbq's in America...or was it top 10...either way, the bbq here was very good.

Luckily my friend made the reservations, because people were waiting out there for over an hour or so. I recommend doing the 3 meat combo for $25, which includes 2 sides. 

Their cocktails are pretty good too. And the service was awesome."}
{"text":"Didn't realize this was the old bobby mcgees till I pulled up. Came based on reviews and was skeptical. The only down side was the price. But the place deserves the high ranking. Not your typical BBQ lunch dive. Very nice place. Tried the Q rolls based on reviews. It was good but not something I have to have. Wish I didn't get em because I couldn't finish everything. Carolina q. Pulled pork with slaw and side of mac n cheese. They were right. Mac was solid. Corn bread was by far my favorite corn bread from a restaurant. Sand which was super. Four stars in conservative. Maybe 4.5. Try this place if you haven't been. To pricy to come often for me. But the service was high quality and atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"Great, no AMAZING BBQ. It's not your petite BBQ joint where you get some BBQ on your lip. In this place you'll get BBQ everywhere!!! On your face, your cheeks, your eyeballs and even places you didn't think you touched when you were eating Bobby Q. The portions are HUGE, the price is on the HUGE size too but its worth it. My only issue is that when I was falling into a food coma, the Waiter didn't take notice and shoved HOME MADE donuts in my face. I about died."}
{"text":"Had the BESSSSSSST BBQ ever.....can't wait to come back again! Matt was a great server, he made sure we had plenty of drinks! The food was at our table in a flash, couldn't believe how fast it was!!!! The place was gorgus!"}
{"text":"Hands down the Best BBQ place in AZ!!! 

We came here on a sat so it was ridiculously packed! We couldn't find a single parking so we had to park somewhere else and walk. The hostess told us the wait would be 30 mins but it was less than that. 

We were seated and our waiter was super friendly. We already looked over the menu when we were waiting so we ordered pull pork sandwich with mash potatoes and my friend ordered two combination: brisket and baby back ribs with Mac and cheese and shoe string fries. For dessert, we went with the sub zero banana. The food came out super fast! The portion sizes were huge too! We shared our plates and omg it was so delicious and flavorful! The meats just fell apart and was cooked to perfection! The mash potatoes went well with my pulled pork sandwich and it was creamy! Mac and cheese was very creamy too and so good. The shoestring fries was just normal fries. We thought it would have some kind of seasoning on it like garlic or something. Now for the dessert. I thought they should've put more bananas on it because it really brought out the flavors. The crust tasted like an oatmeal cookie. Overall, the dessert was just okay and nothing to get excited over. I def want to try their mudslide next time! But It got 5 stars because our server was fantastic and the food was delicious! It was so yummy that when the server and manager asked us how our food tasted....oh you bet you got my answer lol! Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good food and great service. I always order baby back ribs & beef ribs at every BBQ joint I visit. Bobby Q's is very good. You get a ton of food for your dinero. The sides were just okay for me though."}
{"text":"The absolutely best food ever, they acutally adjusted my bill for a YELP discount that I got while I was waiting for my food. My Reisling was rather expensive for St. Michelles, $12.00 the only way I was OK with it was the 10% coupon discount. St. Michelles usually runs 6.00 - 8.00 I have never paid 12.00 for this wine. That was the only disappointing part of the evening."}
{"text":"This place has amazing reviews so we finally decided to try this out and yes, it is definitely worth the Yelp hype. We were seated in the outdoor patio, perfect for the weather that night. The customer service was great and I have no complaints. 

Our meal started with complimentary cornbread. I'm not sure if I was just too hungry or what, but that has gotta be the best cornbread I've ever had in my life. And I don't even like cornbread. For my entree, I got the Southern Fried Chicken with a side of mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. Yuuuum. 

I will definitely be back here to try something that's actually barbecue. The prices are a bit high, but once in a while, I think this place is worth it."}
{"text":"Really good food and a really chill place and great customer service. My wife took me for my first time and loved it. I highly reccommend it"}
{"text":"One of the most popular BBQ places around. When we're here, it's protein time! My boyfriend and I ordered the three meat combo (baby back ribs, beef brisket, pulled pork) with 2 sides (mac & cheese and fries); and we split the order between the two of us. The meat from the baby back ribs was super tender, and easily fell off the bone - just the way I like it. The beef brisket was also tender, and very flavorful. The pulled pork was extremely juicy, giving you that gratification when you bite into it. Two thumbs up on their meat. Nothing spectacular about the mac & cheese and fries though. 

Service was great. I was with some friends who have never been here before, and the waitress patiently explained the menu. She also made some good recommendations to them. I was very happy with her fast service, splitting the check amongst our group correctly and quickly getting out those togo boxes. 

The best part about having a full belly at the end of your dinner is getting free complimentary donuts. I can't say \"no\" to sugar donuts! Love this place."}
{"text":"Went here for my 50th birthday and had a very enjoyable night.  I had the Smoked Prime Rib w/Mac and Cheese and Potato Salad.  It had a wonderful flavor and was tender as well.  Perfectly cooked.

The place was just starting to get busy, but it in no way took away from the great service I had.  The place has a fully stocked bar, so I had to have a spicy Bloody Mary.  

I started with the Cajun Shrimp appetizer and the flavor was spot on.  The shrimp were juicy and delicious and it comes with like garlic bread sticks to sop up the wonderful juices in the bowl.  

To top the night off, I was presented with a Brownie Sundae with candle for my birthday!  (Totally unexpected and delicious)  

Only regret was not going back and getting some BBQ to take home with me."}
{"text":"Tuesday Night. Walked in at 830pm, left 945pm. From order to being served 15 min.

This place is NOT a chain. Support your local Phoenix BBQ restaurants.

One of the few places in Arizona that serves Beef Ribs. Cannot over-emphasize this point..better than Claim Jumper..not even close. Beef ribs have twice as much meat as pork ribs but are much harder to find in restaurants. 

They smoke all their meat on site and everything is super fresh. Melissa & Sawyer were fabulous and I really appreciated the 10% off for using YELP. 

The only downside is that because we sat close to the chicken rack in the back near the kitchen we wound up smelling like a campfire. However we didnt really notice this until after we left and went back to the outside. 

The cornbread starter and donut pastry ender was absolutely unexpected and refreshing. 

Beef Ribs = $22.00
12. Oz Sirloin = $12.00
2 Non Alcoholic Drinks
Total was $45.00 with 10% off..Extremely reasonable, high quality, totally full."}
{"text":"Im a little biased with my wife being the catering manager, but excellent food is excellent food and great service is great service. Being in the restraunt business I truly admire when the easy things are done right. Great service, excellent food and a clean store."}
{"text":"The best BBQ ever! Great atmosphere and amazing food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Omg the best bbq ribs I have had. Must try if you like juicy fatty ribs. I love the fat melting off the ribs."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great staff and wonderful service!  This is a carnivores Disneyland, the Brisket melts in your mouth and the Ribeye is made to order. Bring your appetite because these are healthy portions, BBQ is almost as good as mine..."}
{"text":"Omg! This is a must for BBQ!
First of all ,I want to thank tommy, Dylan and manager Joanna for exceptional service and attentiveness in making our first visit memorable .
I've tried a lot of BBQ and wherever I travel I try to eat local BBQ . I usually can eat a whole slab myself and still have room for more , but not the case here.
We ordered the prime rib brisket with Mac and cheese and shoestring potatoes  and the full slab of St. Louis ribs with Mac and cheese with shoestring potatoes . We were also offered corn bread  free of charge. The brisket melts in your mouth and is so moist and tender I'm drooling right now. Most briskets ive tried get dry and chewy but not here . The ribs had the right char on the outside but the meat falls off the bone with the right smokiness and moist flavor. It was so meaty and filling I only ate 1/2 the slab. The Mac and cheese is very cheesy and filling and the shoestrings were addicting.
Asking for a doggy bag, tommy and Dylan added additional cornbread ,xtra BBQ sauce and a bag of fresh cinnamon donuts! Great experience and I'm going back again ! I usually ask for sauce on the side when eating meats to fully enjoy the flavor of the meat Do not drown meat in sauce"}
{"text":"Bobby Qs has to be one of the better bbq joints around the Phoenix area. This has been our go to restaruant for years. The hostesses are friendly and prompt and work very hard to help patrons with whatever questions they have. The wait staff is super friendly to tourists like ourselves and although food comes slow it's worth the wait. I will say if you are vegan or vegetarian by any means stay away this is definetly a meat friendly environment haha! The only reason i did not rate a 5 is the location, althouh a spectacular building parking is a little awkward and getting to the restaurant via highway takes some work maneuvering. Go here for great bbq and friendly staff. Pre-warning make reservations (yelp is the go to) and go after 730 or before 3! 

Bobby Qs thanks for another great meal!"}
{"text":"My favorite place. I have never had a bad experience. The Burgers are perfection. That's what I am having today. 

We sat outside and they warned us that there is a problem with flies in the morning but we set out here anyway. It is true but hey it's outside and the weather is great!

And they were so accommodating when we asked to move. It's just on the morning and not a big deal."}
{"text":"I have been to many a bbq spot and Bobby Q is at the top. Here on vacation with family and everything we tried was soo good! Have to get the Q rolls to begin. Pulled pork and chicken....top shelf. Brisket melt in your mouth and bbq burger was so tasty (close to my favorite Hodads!). Cornbread as good as anywhere. Way to go Bobby Q!!"}
{"text":"Wow, the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had. I had the coleslaw as my side which was better than any other I can remember.     I've heard that the ribs and brisket are very good too.   Reasonable prices during happy hour.

They have a lounge/bar/dance club attached to the dining room and it was much nicer than I expected.  Our server said Tuesdays are their busiest nights in the lounge/dance club area, (Tuesdays nights WTF?)    Interesting mix of people when I was there on a Wed. night.   Not the Tempe crowd, or Scottsdale crowd, or even the downtown hipster crowd.  It's the METROCENTER crowd which is just a mix of regular city folk."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. We ordered the 3 meat combo with ST. Louis ribs, brisket and sausage. Everything was delicious and I loved their bbq sauce. The mac and cheese was good, it was almost too creamy for my liking tho and the baked potato was also good. All in all, a really good meal and our server was extremely nice and attentive. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the manager in the picture who greeted the customers to our left, skipped our table, table to our right, behind us, in front of us ..yeah, you get the idea. He introduced himself to everyone, checked how their meal was going, and asked if their server was taking care of them. But skipped right over us. Not saying he's racist, but...."}
{"text":"I'm used to only hearing of Bobby Q as a club not as a restaurant. 
I was quite surprised to see the other side! The hostess sat us quickly and were friendly. The server was great, attentive but not too invasive. I ordered the no Bobby Q rolls as an appetizer and wow I loved them! It tasted like a bbq mini chimichanga with a side of bbq sauce! For my entree I had the bbq pulled poke sandwich with shoe string fries and it was delicious! The service is great, our table was cleared as we finished our meals, our drinks refilled and had the manager come around and ask how our meals were! 
I can't wait to go back and try more! 
Great job to the kitchen and staff!"}
{"text":"Don't know what all the hype is about this establishment but here's my feedback: First off my wife had the Ribeye entree I specifically told our waiter (a young fellow) no pink on the ribeye & to have whom ever is cooking/grilling the ribeye to cut the meat to verify there are no pink, but my wife received her uncut ribeye & she only ate what's not pink (1/2 of the ribeye). I was eager to try the beef ribs & again I told the young fellow easy BBQ sauce on them beef ribs because I wanted to taste the meat & the smoke flavor. To our surprise none of them were meant to our expectations. The beef ribs are fall of the bone but too much BBQ sauce on them ribs & I couldn't even taste the smoked meat. Ask any bbq enthusiast the taste are in the meat not the sauce. I rather stick with Dillons KC style beef ribs at Arrowhead location where you can taste the meat. This establishment is my first & last."}
{"text":"Everything is great here. Food is wonderful and so is the service.  Great for special occasions too. And those fresh donuts are amazing."}
{"text":"I loooooove Bobby Q! I've been coming to this location for years now with my family. It's a hidden gem off the side of the highway.

You're started off with complimentary cornbread. BOY, OH BOY. IT'S SO GOOD. 

We ordered a family combo style type of meal. The ribs literally fall off the bone. My mouth is watering just remembering the ribs. The chicken is good, but I'm all about the ribs! We ordered both the baby back and St. Louis and both are highly recommended.

The only downside is the size of the sides. They're incredibly small! I wish they would consider a bigger portion of the sides.

Everyone also gets complimentary donuts made fresh at the end of your meal! They're so delicious. I would pick those over the desserts."}
{"text":"Awesome food....however I have history here...used to come here all the time when it was Bobby McGees...regardless...best BBQ I've had in a long time...brisket melts in your mouth sausage was great...well cooked baked potato...and the ranch beans...about the best I've ever had...oh...don't forget to try the house Amber Ale...made just for them...tasty addition to any BBQ dinner"}
{"text":"Corn bread is to die for!! Word of caution if you're dieting;STAY AWAY!  this place corrupts anyone's healthy eating habits lol!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Atmosphere and service.  Been coming to this place since it was Bobby McGees.    Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is the second time here, the last time was many years ago, way before there was a yelp.   The food is good, and the service was great, Hunter (waiter) was very attentive to our table, even as busy as he was  good job hunter.  My wife and I shared the Whole Hog Heaven (48) it is a designed for 2, but it is enough food for 3 to 4 people.  every thing we got with it had good flavor.

My only complaint was the drink we order was a chocolate martini, sporting an Oreo cookie when served it was missing the Oreo,  Come to find out they where out of Oreo, now tell me if I am wrong but how hard would it to be if they went to the store and got a couple of bags of Oreo, or take it off the drink special sheet.  Now I will say when I said some thing to the manager walking around he did accommodate us and took it off the bill, but the reason I got the drink is because I have dip an Oreo in milk, but have never dipped in in vodka, I was bummed."}
{"text":"Loved the food, service and overall experience. Travis was the server he was really friendly, attentive and helpful. He recommended the brisket, corn bread and corn. Omg they were amazing! I would recommend them. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A girlfriend of mine wanted to give this place a try. I personally shy away from BBQ spots as they generally are overpriced, they over-sauce and under produce according to my BBQ standards. However, this place is good and I will definitely return. We decided on the Whole Hog Heaven as we are East Valley folk and although we plan on returning it may be a while, so a sample of everything is what we were aiming for. We chose the baby backs and St. Louis for ribs and sausage and brisket for our other meat options. For sides we ordered the Mac and Cheese, which was delicious by the way, fries, ranch beans and an extra side of roasted corn. The meal came with cornbread.  The food was delicious and plentiful. The ribs were tender, meat falling off the bones. The brisket was good but I have had better. The sausage was tasty but nothing spectacular. All of the sides were tasty. I left there with a full belly, a hefty to go bag and no compliant. I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm in Phoenix on business. A coworker suggested Bobby Q's, so I gave it a try. The St Louis ribs, Mac-N-Cheese and Potato Salad are life-changing!! I will be back in Phoenix, and Bobby Q's is on the top of my \"must\" list!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided on a last minute lunch date to Bobby Q's and it was fantastic! Tanner was our server and he did amazing. He was attentive and everything came out fast. Donny, the manager, was sure to stop by and say hi. Thank you guys for a great time."}
{"text":"Bobby Q's deserves it's excellent reputation! The food, ambiance and service were great. The server's suggestions totally met our tastes. I loved the baked potato with all the fixins and barbecued brisket. I drank a local beer and it was perfect for my taste."}
{"text":"This was our second visit and again they did a fantastic job. We ordered the Whole Hog Heaven which came with two types of ribs and two different meats and three different side items. We split it between the two of us and still had leftovers. At the end of the day Bobby Q has fantastic food, average service and a rich and interesting history!"}
{"text":"Food is great, prices are not. Bobby Q's offers some delicious BBQ. Brisket, chicken, ribs, sausage, ALL delicious! However, I think it can be a little pricey around $15-20 a person with a non alcoholic drink. Waitresses are beautiful and friendly. It really is great BBQ though if you are willing to spring for it. Warning: Thurs nights are hip hop nights. It attracts a mixed crowd, and a lot of ghetto crowd. The restaurant does a good job of keeping them behaved though."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough positive things about this spot. My wife and I loved the ambiance and everything we ordered. The service was great. If there was a draw back it would be a little pricy but not too bad."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best BBQ place I have ever had the pleasure of visiting! Lucille's at Tempe Marketplace had been my favorite, but Bobby Q's is even better, and that's saying something! From the time you are seated, the staff are friendly and attentive, even when the restaurant is packed (which is always). The food is to die for, I've tried their ribs, and the pulled pork sandwich, both were superb! The cornbread is amazing, I have to remind myself to save room for the actual meal. Also, at the end of the meal, they bring you freshly-made, warm cinnamon-sugar donut holes to enjoy. It's a bit far out location-wise, especially if you are in the Tempe/Mesa area, but for the best BBQ in Arizona, it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Customer service is amazing. The managers are great. I left my credit card and sunglasses here and they were returned to me the next time I came in to eat. Oh and you can't beat the corn bread and donuts. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Our group had a wonderful lunch experience. Melissa was a great server, meeting our needs before we asked. The food came out quickly. The food was hot and flavorful.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Spacious facility for larger groups.  Loved lunching outside on the porch, covered but still having an outdoors feeling.  I had a great salad, Bobby's chicken with blue cheese that had chunks of cheese in the dressing.  Only negative was being able to hear what the person across the table was saying."}
{"text":"Cornbread? Yes, please! I love cornbread. This place is cool. We went for lunch and while it's decorated to look like a BBQ dive you can tell they wanted a \"trendy dive\" look if that even exists. I likes. 
First you get the cornbread, which is my favorite so I started off happy. I had a salad, but two people got BBQ. I know - who gets a salad the first time they go to a BBQ restaurant? That makes no sense. They liked the meats and I think my husband said \"meh.\" about the sauce. The baby had mac and cheese which he loved (and I liked) and the chicken was also a winner. 

I have to say - donuts at the end of the meal? Um, no. Ugh, no.They tasted pretty heavy with oil and sure enough after about 2 minutes I had the worst stomach pain of my life. Just say no to the donuts, I beg you. Unless you plan ahead and  know you are going to have a donut and you save some room, otherwise they will put you over the edge, and I am saying that after having a salad! I have never been anywhere that gives you donuts for your ride home, so I guess that is original on their part, right?

Overall, I will go back, this place was fun! Next time, pulled pork."}
{"text":"Stopped over in Phoenix during our travels and enjoyed an excellent meal at Bobby Q's. We had the beef ribs which were 4 large bones, shoe string fries and roasted corn along with a wedge salad. Everything was delicious and plenty for the two of us. Our server Hal was the best. He spent some time with us so we felt right at home. Easy access right off the freeway and plenty of parking. A great dining experience."}
{"text":"Great smoked meats and large portions. Pulled pork and baby back ribs were excellent. Cole slaw with pecans was also very good, not as sweet as I was expecting. Had the q rolls for appetizer, I did not like these. Brisket with sauce wrapped in a tortilla and fried. Like a taquitos and I don't like taquitos.
Sat night at 6 seemed to be their busiest time."}
{"text":"Husband and I ate here for the first time this evening.  I have tried so hard to find good barbecue since moving to Surprise from Memphis 4 years ago, and nothing came even close to \"good\"!  But, Bobby Q has made me one happy gal!  Pulled pork and St. Louis ribs were outstanding!!!  So well smoked and tender!  Macaroni and cheese was the creamiest I have ever had.  Brooke, our server, was superb.  Very attentive and helpful without being a nuisance.  I highly recommend this restaurant, and have already started telling everyone I know just how excited I was with this barbecue!"}
{"text":"Well we went to the soft opening yesterday and I must say.. this is the best BBQ that I have had here in AZ.. The meat was tender, veggies seasoned perfect, mashed potatoes on point.  The service was great (need to continue when you open on 3 Oct 16).  The location is perfect Stapley and the US 60.. we will be coming back.  Very nice meeting Bobby too, such a great guy doing wonderful things with this bbq"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Best BBQ I've probably ever eaten. Great atmosphere and service! Reasonably priced considering portion size and quality! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love the great selection of food. Clearly the barbecued is absolutely delicious, pulled pork. Love the sandwiches as well. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. At night on Thursdays and the weekends the club part, is off the hook!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here a few times now and we love this place!! Hands down the best baby back ribs we've ever had. We usually get the Q Rolls to start and split a whole rack of ribs and leave stuffed. The complimentary corn bread is also really yummy! The servers are also super friendly; every time we go I always make a comment to my boyfriend about how nice the servers were. We've taken friends and family here and they also love it!"}
{"text":"I tried Bobby Q's on the reccomendation of Yelp.  You guys know your stuff and I do trust Yelp when it comes to searching out new places.  As I've said before, I am no bbq afficianado, I just know what I like.  It was a weeknight when we went so it was not super busy.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  I noted that there was a large bar area and thought that this place was probably a hoppin joint on a Friday or Saturday night.  

Our server was very pleasant and helpful.  I asked what she liked on the menu and she told me her favorite was the brisket but she recommended I try a combo.  I got brisket and ribs.  I started wih a salad which was tasty and fresh.  My meal arrived shortly after and our server was correct, the brisket was so tender it just melted in my mouth.  It had a nice flavor.  Now, on to the ribs....yet again, melt in your mouth, tender and flavorful.  My daughter was happy as a clam with her chicken strips.  So, why only three stars?  Well, I don't usually disclose things like this but about an hour after we got home, I made several trips to the comode.  I never have issues when I eat, ever.  Something did not sit right with me or something was not good.  Was it the salad?  Don't really know but it lasted for two days.   Suffice it to say that, if that happend to you, would you be leary to give a stellar review and go back soon after?  

Bobby Q's has a nice atmosphere, cozy and warm.  I loved the music that was playing......blues and old soul.  The service was great too.  The other issue that I had was the location.  If I did not have a GPS, I never would have found the place.  It's set back off the road and the signage is very small.  

Maybe I'll give it another try in a year or so.....when the two days on the comode is a faint memory."}
{"text":"Great place for a large casual group BBQ dinner pig-out session.

~$25 for a 2 meat plate with 2 sides

Cornbread - On the house! So moist and soft that it falls apart if you try to grab it with a fork. Perfect amount of sweet and bread-y taste.

Q-rolls - brisket inside a croissant roll, tasty.

Brisket - the brisket here is so amazing tasty with the most tender consistency. I love it here, I could eat a bunch of it. Highly recommend getting brisket.

Baby Back Ribs - Very tender, falls off the bone and great flavor in the sauce.

Donuts - On the house! Made fresh, extremely warm with cinnamon on the outside. It's just like a churro in a donut form, YUM."}
{"text":"If you ever want to eat bar-b-q any where else ever again do not eat here.  This place will ruin all other places for you.  Truly amazing food. A highlight of our trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had a great experience, out server was attentive and always checked up on us. The manager even introduced herself to us , the atmosphere is great as well as the people . The food is amazing, fresh and great in taste , my boyfriend got the brisket, theres no need for a knife , you can basically pull it off. The fried chicken is crispy on the outside but juicy on the inside . The artichoke dip with the garlic bread is a must get , got a little kick to it. They even gave us doughnut balls coated in brown sugar on our way out. I'm definitely coming back"}
{"text":"My wife and her parents came to Bobby Q's to celebrate a birthday.  My wife and I ordered the \"Whole Hog Heaven\" (Baby Back Ribs, Beef Ribs, Pork, Brisket, Mac & Cheese, and Potato Salad).  Our meal was simply amazing.  My wife said, \"This is the best BBQ I have ever had\".  The Brisket was absolutely amazing and the ribs fell off the bone.  My wife preferred the Baby Back Ribs over the Beef Ribs, but they were both excellent.  

Since we were celebrating a birthday, our waitress brought us a desert.  We ordered the Bread Pudding...it was AWESOME."}
{"text":"Worst place I've ever been the manager profiles people without knowing who they are! Get another job you prick!"}
{"text":"Every time we have guests in town (and otherwise!) we always make a point to go to Bobby Q's.  Every single meal has been exceptional and our out of towners are blown away by the ribs and chicken.  There's a reason this is one of Yelp's Top 10 for Phoenix!  I've never had tender, juicy ribs like they make in my life.  

And every time we have to bring a side dish to a friends house for dinner, we pick up a pan of the Mac n Cheese and some corn muffins.  We're the most popular people at the party!  I'm thankful this little gem of a place is only a few miles from me!"}
{"text":"Bobby Q's is the BEST BBQ restaurant in the valley. Better then Famous Daves. Better then Waldo's, in my opinion. This used to be Bobby McGee's in the 90's and they would have live band and dancing there. I went there with my wife, mother-in-law and daughter. We didn't make reservations because we didn't know you had to until we had called them that day. At the time, they weren't taking anymore reservations until after 8pm and that was too late for us. It was only 3:30p at the time. The woman on the phone said the wait time was about 45mins, so we went anyways. We got there around 4:00pm and put our names on the list. They said they would call us when the table was ready. I kind of missed the little pagers we usually get at Cheesecake Factory and other restaurants, but personal service is still nice too. So I waited 30mins, checked the list and there were still 2 groups ahead of us. Check again at 45mins and still one group ahead of us. The hostess apologized and explained that customer with reservations would get seated first, which made sense, but I was getting hungry. Finally 55mins in we got seated (near the kitchen door) and was able to order drinks immediately as we looked over the menu. They had some specials, so I got the Prime Rib/Lobster Tail with 2 sides for $30. I got the Mac & Cheese and Corn I believe. I can't remember what everyone else got, but I know they loved the food. They brought out warm corn bread, which was moist, sweet and great with butter. My wife and mother-in-law loved their alcoholic drinks. I got lemonade which was excellent as well. The meals came after about 15mins. The prime rib simply melted in your mouth. It was delicious. The Mac & Cheese was perfect. Nice and creamy and cheesy, just like how I make it. My wife tried mine and loved it. I tried her bake beans and even those were incredible. The corn was also good, Even the coleslaw that I tasted was very tasty. The lobster, we juicy and I doused it in the butter for another bite. It was cooked perfectly. I tried my wife's Baby Back Rib and they were smokey, moist and incredible with the BBQ sauce. I couldn't believe how good everything was. The waitress came back and forth to our table at least 6-7 times during the meal to see if there was anything else we needed. Very friendly and courteous. My daughter, who's only 2.5yrs loved everything, especially the mac & cheese since she loves cheese. Definitely one of the best BBQ meals I've ever ate. I will probably get the Brisket or Baby-Back Rib the next time I go. If you have BBQ and Steak, this is the place to go. It was definitely worth the wait and the kitchen door didn't even bother me because I was enjoying the food. I forgot a couple things. i forgot to mention the appetizers. They give you a lot for the appetizers. We got the BBQ wings and Artichoke/Spinach dip and it was fabulous. some places will give you 5-6 wings for appetizer, but we got like twice that amount and it was delicious. At the end of the meal they give you soft delicious donuts for free. 5 stars from me here."}
{"text":"The Bobby Q staff is serious about customer service. This is one of the warmest and friendliest restaurants you could hope to find, with -exceptional- bbq. I've had better sausage, but the brisket here, smoked for 18 hrs, is astounding. Our waitress suggested the local Bobby Q amber craft, and while I was skeptical and figuring it would be meh, it turned out to be a perfect compliment to the food. I can't wait to try some steaks and ribs!"}
{"text":"Great service! Waiter was friendly and knowledgable, special touches like the extra BBQ came out heated in an insulated craft my drink was in a pineapple fun stuff like that . The brisket was absolutely the best I have ever had and the Mac and cheese was pretty awesome too ! Big portions so bring your appetite !"}
{"text":"Food was Excellent. Highly recommend this place. The service was average but the food made up for it. Only thing to note is the dark lighting in some parts of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Shelley Sikora has to be one of Phoenix's most passionate restaurateurs. She has a remarkable history managing a restaurant empire and also has more than one published cookbook. She was one of 34 U.S. chefs chosen to appear in the 2006 IACP cookbook, \"For the Love of Food\". Her newest cookbook called \"Skinny Bread\", 100 Amazing Ways to make Flatbread.

Bobby Q's serves up authentic dry rubbed meats cooked to perfection, and spicy sauces. Walking in, it feels very comfortable. The decor has always been outstanding for the past twenty years. The attentive service is solid.

I could rave about dinner but let me just say, this house is in the top 5 'best BBQ' In AZ. Want to be #1 on my list, let's have live Blues. And I almost forgot to mention the cornbread and donuts."}
{"text":"Delicious! Got a flight of the local brew and the beef brisket. Nice atmosphere.  Good service"}
{"text":"I was amaze of of high rating but was a bit disappointed. 

Ambience:  for a bbq place.  The interior has a fine dining steak house feeling to it with a southwestern dining on the outside seating area.  A good family friendly restaurant.

Service: Definitely has a welcome feeling to it. Waiter was good, but the manager was better and more considerate.  Our food came out on a timely manner ...but when we ask for bbq sauces, it took a while.  However, the Sauces was worth waiting for....

Food: Complimentary cornbread was great! It was soft, moist, and had a cake texture. It would have been better if was hot instead of room temperature.  We order the artichoke appetizer... The bread stick was perfectly toasted with garlic herb butter, but the dip itself was too heavy cheesy.  As for the bbq... I wished it was hot.  It was lukewarm, but not hot enough to bring out the full bbq experience.  The meat was smoke very well that left no greasy fatty taste, but the sauces is the best part.  All the meats was overly cooked so it did not stay intact very well. In the end, everything tasted like pull pork.

Overall, because of the temperature of the food and the overcooked meats, I rated it as 3 stars."}
{"text":"Bobby Q is now my favorite restaurant in Phoenix after my first visit.   The atmosphere was rustic, fun, and barbequey, the food was awesome, and the service was attentive.   I had the pulled pork and brisket...wonderful.   The mac and cheese side was certainly the best mac and cheese I've ever had...super thick, rich and smooth.  The bill for 2 with 2 beers and one premium cocktail was $50...AWESOME value!  Super highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"We are in Phoenix dog sitting and visiting restaurants we made note of watching Check Please Arizona on PBS.  Bobby Q was our first stop on our list and the food was wonderful. We ordered the Pulled Pork and Brisket Sandwiches with Pecan Cole Slaw and Mac & Cheese for sides. It all lived up to the review. The meats were tender, moist and the sides complimented the meat really well. 
The 4 Stars is for the fact that I had to get up and find our Server to ask for more BBQ Sauce because the sandwiches were served with barely a touch of sauce.  
The bag of To-Go Doughnuts they give you at the end of the meal would of jumped our overall Review Score to 4 1/2 Stars, but Yelp doesn't give you that option."}
{"text":"Amazing. Definition of BOTH, melts in your mouth AND falls off the bone. Wish I would've tried it sooner."}
{"text":"Holy Shiznit! Food was AMAZING!!!  Pulled Pork, Ribs and Brisket were off the hook! You MUST get the Mac & ChZ! Save room for their little donuts....puts a Churro to Shame!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! I must say I put them to the test and they passed with flying colors! Let's start at the beginning...We came at the worst time of the day for food quality & service in the restaurant world 3:45pm. We were greeted by the manager he was very polite & the server Ann quickly came over with a big smile to introduce herself. I quizzed her on vodka drinks she nailed it! Our food came out and was hot, fresh, and delicious! The portions sizes were perfect, meaning my eyes are bigger than my stomach and they didn't disappoint, leftovers!!!!! I had the baby back ribs and the meat fell off the bone, clean...  the mac & cheese and the corn were seasoned just right. My dish was very flavorful. My daughter had the pork sandwich and every time she took a bite she groaned, keep in mind we eat out EVERYDAY for ALL of our meals & we are PICKY!! No complaints. The cleanliness of the bathrooms and dining room were excellent! Ann was very attentive and the manager even checked on us to make sure we were enjoying everything. Definitely on the top of our restaurant list! Great Food, Great Service."}
{"text":"Delicious! The smoked pork flaked off like butter. The gift bag of donuts given at the end of the meal was a nice treat! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good. Cornbread was excellent. Appetizer-Q rolls on point. Baby back ribs were meaty and tender. Pulled pork reminded me of home. I'll be back."}
{"text":"In town for a few days so I decided to check out this highly rated BBQ place. Killer environment and great service!

I really enjoyed my brisket plate with mac n cheese, Brisket didn't have too much fat and had great smoke rings. Mac n cheese was homemade and super fresh. 

Finished it off with complimentary dessert donuts! I'll definitely come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Baffled at the ratings this place gets.  The ambiance is nice, and it would be a fun place to go with a group of friends for drinks and \"pre-gaming it\" before going out.

But...

My family and I are rib lovers, and in no way shape or form did Bobby Q make the grade.  

The waiter touted them as smoking \"all of their meats\" for over 18 hours.  I almost fell of the booth, because you smoke meat that long either it's going to get bitter from the amount of creosote building up, or at the very least it'd be overcooked (well, perhaps except for pulled pork).  Ribs can tolerate about 5 hours.  His hyperbole was obvious.  Perhaps some people get really excited when they hear this line, because it's supposed to sound impressive.    

I ordered the St. Louis style spares, and parents ordered the baby backs.  All of the ribs were overcooked and mushy (\"falling off the bone\").  The spares were actually better cooked than the babys, which isn't saying much.  Interestingly enough, the babys were very fatty, in fact my Dad was spitting out pieces of fat.  Spares were not as bad (go figure, given it's usually the other way around).  We are not \"fat shy\" but this was really excessive.  The rack was not trimmed properly.

The ribs tasted smoked, although not an overly pronounced smoke ring.  Definitely not smoked 18 hours.

People freak about the Mac & Cheese here, but it's really nothing special.  Creamy and they certainly use processed cheese (which isn't always bad), but nothing more.  I really liked the beans - not too sweet.

In short, I could see how the other offerings on the menu may be good, and given the ambience and service another experience with different food may give better ratings, but ya gotta do your ribs well if you are going to call yourself a BBQ restaurant.

Once again, the lack of good BBQ in Phoenix continues to amaze me.

As a side note, we had leftover ribs.  I came home with my parents and was about to take them in the house.  My parents said, \"you really aren't going to eat those, are you\"?  I said, \"probably not\".  Into the trash they went."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch when we were out in Scottsdale for a debauchery filled spring training trip. We got a recommendation from a friend to try this place out and it didn't disappoint.

We got the Q-Rolls to start (brisket filled) which come with a chipotle dip. These were solid.

I ordered the full rack of baby backs and split it with my buddy who got a two item combo with brisket and pulled pork. The ribs were fall off the bone tender and had great flavor. The brisket was phenomenal as well. The pulled pork was good but the weakest of all the items we had.

Best part of the lunch was not losing on credit card roulette at the end. If/when I make it back to the Phoenix area I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I really love this spot. One of the few Phoenix restaurants definitely worth going out of your way for. Smoasted chicken is fantastic along with the baby back ribs. Deep wood flavor infuses most grilled items. Patio is lovely Oct-May."}
{"text":"The food and service is really one for the ages. Great service and the food is delicious! Very well priced for some good food. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I don't think this place needs anymore reviews and I'm sure everything has already been said.
This was fantastic and great for the money spent. The service was also top notch. Loved the cornbread before the meal, the Mac and cheese was delicious and the meat was tender and flavorful! Not much more you can ask for! Winner winner!!"}
{"text":"Bobby Q BBQ. Clever. The restaurant had me at the name but it didn't hurt that they made Yelps 100 places to eat list. What does one do when they find themselves in Phoenix for the first time ever? Head over to Bobbie Q, of course. I came here for one reason and one reason only. Baby back ribs. I do love my baby backs. There is a pretty large parking lot to fit all the hungry BBQ lovers in one place. As I walked in and smelled the smoky goodness, the hostess in the front handed my party of three a bag of freshly made cinnamon sugar donuts while we waited a few short minutes for a table. Like a child who's been offered desert before dinner, I gleefully followed the hostess to our table whilst munching on my sugary donuts. Our waiter took our drink orders and I decided on the baby backs with a side of potato salad and mac and cheese. 

After what seemed like a forever of eyeing and sniffing my neighbors meals, our plates came out. The full rack of baby backs were huge. The photo does not do it justice. Talk about a bang for your buck! They smelled amazing as the smokey aroma filled my lungs. I went in with my knife and realized how easy the cut was. There is hours of love put into these ribs because the first bite just melted in my mouth. The best thing about these ribs...they are not overly sauced. You can ask for extra BBQ and add as needed, but the meat is not masked with sauce. I got through about half of the tender rack of ribs before I realized that I still had two bowls piled high with mac and cheese and potato salad. I used the complimentary corn bread with butter to create potato salad and mac and cheese sammies and inhaled my sides. The mac and cheese was so creamy with a distinct sharp cheddar flavor. I wish that the cheese was a little more gooey than creamy, but the flavors where there. The potato salad had good flavor and great textures. It paired really well with the sweet cornbread. Heads up, this place won't do you well if you are on the diet. This is one cheat meal you will not regret. 

The service was pretty impressive. Our waiter gave suggestions and replaced our drinks with new ones before we finished the original. Our food was served hot and when we were tipping over from being too full, he brought out to go boxes to pile our leftovers in. One of the managers was walking around in the restaurant and checking on tables throughout our meal. We gave kudos to the chef when he asked us about our experience. I didn't imagine Phoenix to be known for BBQ, but I was not disappointed with what I got. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating (with a sprinkling cooling system) with big enough tables to feel at ease. As I walked out, another bag of cinnamon donuts were handed to me and I vouched to be back. 5/5 overall experience!"}
{"text":"This is definitely THE best barbecue joint in all of Phoenix. My out of town family even raves about Bobby q's and has to visit every time they are in town. My husband and I normally split the whole hog and get the Cajun shrimp as an appetizer. I'm not a shrimp fan but these shrimp are amazing. I can't get enough of them, the sauce they are in is sooooooo good. The whole hog, we normally get ribs and double brisket. The brisket is amazing, ribs are delish and even the pulled pork is awesome. We love the cornbread and the 'to go' donuts as well. If you haven't been here before you MUST try. I can't recommend it enough"}
{"text":"This place was OK. I was surprised about the overwhelming amount of positive reviews, so I had to check it out for myself. I'm not from the South but I know when great food is great, and this place is good, but not great. The St. Louis ribs are better than the baby backs, which are a little too sweet. The mac and cheese was nothing to write home about -- it almost tasted from the box, but not as orange in color. Two friends who had the beef brisket said it was OK but too mushy. I got the peach cobbler, which was mediocre (and seemed like it had been microwaved hot). It's a far way to go for OK bbq, in my opinion. 

Most of us at the meal thought this place was fairly expensive as BBQ joints go. It was $17 for a two-meat sampler, and apps were about $7-8."}
{"text":"We visit our niece in Phoenix several times a year and always visit Bobby Q. While it is pricy, the service is spot on, food is spot on and the wait staff and bussers have that obvious \"we're family\"  camaraderie  found at the high end restaurants I've worked in before. Everyone is helpful to us as guests, the staff is helpful to each other, good service training shows! This time we are here for the 4th of July, where else but here for our meal? Nicole helped get information to us prior to our arrival, Victoria helped get everything organized the day of. Thanks for helping to make our day special!"}
{"text":"grabbed a full rack of ST LOUIS RIBS and some sides at the carryout window. they were fall-off-the-bone tender -- i like my ribs a bit more toothsome but BOBBY Q's delivers on the whole tender promise. nice smokey flavor and both sauces were tangy and full flavored without being too sweet.

the sides were tasty. the potato salad was nearly as good as mine (which is very good) and the mac-n-cheese was creamy and rich.

the ladies at the counter were as nice as can be. next time i'm in the PHOENIX area, i'm gonna make a point of having a sit down experience at BOBBY Q's. 

maybe i'll even try the brisket and pulled pork ..."}
{"text":"Love this place the food is amazing. The free corn bread is awesome and the free donuts for desert are awesome as well. Staff is always nice. Only somewhat down size is that's it's really dark some times hard to see the wonderful food."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night. Went to the bar/happy hour while waiting about 40 mins for our dinner table, for a party of 3. The outside bar area patio seating was soaked because of leaking misters. And inside the bar was insanely loud.

Food was good. I had the roasted chicken and I wouldn't order it again...I'd try something else. It wasn't cold, but it wasn't fresh off the grill hot either. Baked potato was delicious, and roasted veggies were great. Corn bread was great. The food definitely tasted home-cooked. Not too greasy, and not too fatty. My meal was $13, almost the cheapest main course option. Nor sure it's worth the price.

I would have only given Bobby Q's 2 stars, but the servers were awesome - they were attentive and fast, and they gave our table an extra bag of mini-donuts for free. I give an extra star for that.

If I'm not paying, I'll gladly visit Bobby Q's again one day."}
{"text":"Looking for great BBQ in Phoenix, look no further. You can smell their food from down the street, and my stomach was rumbling just from reading the menu! So many choices (get a sampler we did!). You get a generous helping of the different BBQ meats PLUS sides & corn bread. The ribs were outstanding so tender, sauced perfectly, and finger licking good! You can get mixed drinks here if you want & desserts looked amazing but we were too full to get any this time out."}
{"text":"This has and will always get a great rating from me... the food is always OUTSTANDING.. the atmosphere is always  WELCOMING...and the service is always GREAT!!! My buddy had never been and since having dinner here with me last week... he's already been once... Keep up the AWESOME WORK!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California with my boyfriend from Texas...and this Bar-B-Q passed the taste test !! Great waiter and the-manager checked on us to see how we liked the food. 
We will be back ...thank you"}
{"text":"Went to Phoenix on business and I wanted to take an associate out for lunch. He always talks about how much he loves BBQ ribs so I did a search on Yelp and decided on Bobby Q. They did not disappoint. Not only was the entire meal one of the best BBQ I ever had, but they took 10% of the bill for mentioning Yelp. How cool is that? Great place, great waitresses and phenomenal ribs and sides..."}
{"text":"Bobby-Q is a pretty good place for...you guessed it, BBQ.  The brisket's pretty good and tender.  The portion sizes are large so you won't go home hungry.  The place is quite big so there's plenty of seating including outdoors for those balmy summer nights.  And if you get bored, you can go check out the club/lounge in back of the restaurant.

Kind of gimmicky but not a bad place."}
{"text":"This barbecue is not what it's hyped to be. Not a candle to little miss BBQ. Not the flavor or tenderness we'd want from barbecue. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Bobby Q.... You have officially ruined BBQ for me. Nothing will ever be as good and I live too far away to get to enjoy this pure heaven again in the near future so now I am deprived of amazing BBQ.... All because of Bobby Q. 

I just left another BBQ place (this time in Atlanta, Georgia) and due to my now high standards for BBQ I must say I was severely disappointed :( I am currently sitting in the parking lot of a mediocre BBQ joint with extremely high reviews from the locals lamenting over the loss of Bobby Q to my boyfriend. 

I forgot to mention in my last review that not only was every single item that we ordered from the menu spot on but Ann, our waitress, also gave us mini funnel cake like donuts to go... ON THE HOUSE. I mean come on guys... No one does that!! 

To sum thing up... I have just been across America and back... Literally... and Bobby Q is the only restaurant that had such a lasting impression on me that I just HAD to come back and write an update for. My only question for them is CAN YOU OPEN A LOCATION ON THE EAST COAST PLEASE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and lots of it.  It is amazing, and the ribs are wonderful & all the different sides, everything & great desserts, mgr & staff are wonderful."}
{"text":"BOBBY Q'S. was just ranked among the TOP 30  BBQ  restaurants in the US! 

Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Miracles do happen! I'm blown away by the kindness of strangers from this restaurant! My dear friend (71 yr old) Millie lives in Phoenix (AZ) and is home bound ---her bday is tomorrow 9/21. She has been craving BQ from this restaurant all summer long! I called this restaurant (from Ashland, OR) and begged if they could please deliver food to Millie. This restaurnt only delivers for large catering job.  Not only did this place deliver her food----they gave her BQ ribs, brisket, baked potato (all the fixings), baked beans, their famous mac & cheese, cinnamon donuts, banana cream pie with a pink candle ---FOR FREE!  I also happen to mention that Millie did not even have milk in her house --- so they delivered her big cups of milk.  The delivery person's name was Jason (coincidence---just like her adoring son) and he so kindly made her a plate of food and put the rest of the food in her refrig. He even texted me a  picture so I could see my dear dear friend, Millie. I am touched by the kindness of strangers----KUDOS and heart blessings to The Managers - Joe, Rennie, Jason, the amazing chefs, and the owners of BobbyQ's Restaurant in Phoenix----THANK YOU ALL ---- !  This is truly a random act of kindness!  

Please---If you are ever are in Phoenix - try this place ---- tell them Millie sent you!  Eat savory BQ in honor of a woman that can no longer walk. 

 http://www.bobbyq.net

THANK U---I can't stop crying---you made her birthday so special !!!!  

KINDNESS TRULY DOES MATTER!!!!  I am so so touched!  Bless all you who made ths amazing food====and Millie's day so special.  

I have posted this on Facebook and yelp. I am ever so grateful."}
{"text":"Service is impeccable and the food is delicious with great portions! The drinks are great, the free donuts on your way out are a nice touch! If anyone asks me for great BBQ I send them to Bobby Q's no questions asked."}
{"text":"We travel from Vegas to Phoenix 3-4 times a year and eat here everyday. Food is great and service is OUTSTANDING!! Taylor the manager remembers us every time. He's phenomenal."}
{"text":"We had dinner there with our 2 year old daughter. The food was delicious. I highly recommend the Q rolls as an appetizer. Our waitress was very friendly, honest and knowledgeable about the menu. The manager asked how our meal was and noticed our daughter was getting restless. He told us it would be fine to let her run around. Obviously a kid friendly place! We also noticed the manager comped food for an active military man in his uniform. Can't get better than that!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service!! The portions are huge and they have the best corn bread!"}
{"text":"This was the best BBQ I've had in my life. Celebrated 55th birthday. Got the whole hog heaven, and it was! Service was great. The waitress and the manager were very helpful and welcoming. Told them that they needed to open one in LA! Beef brisket and mac and cheese are great. It was all great. Didn't do the q-rolls because I wanted to fill up on the meat, which I did. You won't be disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"Went on Yelp yesterday looking for dinner idea.  Bobby Qs popped up, and sounded good.  Made reservation for 630pm, walked in and seated us immediately.  Server was sweet and prompt.  Tried the Q rolls which were delicious, but the chipotle dip was weak.  We both ordered chicken, and portions were huge!  Two meals each out of both entrees. My only negative comment is their prices for cocktails.  Vodka Paloma was $12!!  Way over priced.... only reason I didn't order a second.  Completely enjoyable evening!"}
{"text":"Based on a very high recommendation from a friend, we made a reservation for the night that we flew into Phoenix for a guys golf/Spring training trip.  We could not have been more pleased with this decision.

We were seated promptly for our 7:30 reservation.  Our waiter (so sorry I forgot his name) conversed with us as he took our order - asked what we ere doing in town, where we were going, etc.  He answered our questions and made recommendations.

Two of the guys shared the Hog Heaven, two ordered the St Louis ribs and I ordered the beef ribs.  We also ordered the Q Rolls as an appetizer.  They Q Rolls were incredibly delicious (order this!) and even though the dinner portions were large, at the end of the meal everything was gone.

One of the managers (Jack) came by a number of times to see how we were doing and converse about the history of the restaurant, where we were golfing, what baseball games we were seeing, etc.  The personal touches made us feel very comfortable and welcome.

Then they topped it all off with a small bag of donuts and sent us on our way.  Wish we could have come back but our time there was packed.  But next time we're in Phoenix, you can bet we'll be by."}
{"text":"Bobby Q's is one of my favorite restaurants I have been to in Phoenix. The meat is always flavorful and tender; the rotisserie chicken is the BEST I have ever had."}
{"text":"We had great service & the ribs were delish. It was extremely busy & parking was a trick...not to mention it's in kind of a run down area. That seems to be how Phoenix is though. Was too full to order dessert but they brought us mini donuts at the end anyway - so yummy!"}
{"text":"Okay, hard for me to give 5 stars to a casual restaurant but I totally agree with the overall Yelp rating that this place is 4.5 stars for food.  First time visit and have been meaning to go for 10 months since moving to PHX.  I got the Baby back ribs, potato salad & grilled veggies.  Ribs were great with little fat or gristle.  Pot. salad is awesome.  Two of my friends had the fried chicken (boneless) with chicken gravy.  I kept poaching their chicken, mac cheese and mashed potatoes. Corn bread is tasty but crumbles too easily for me.  Desserts were good.  

Definitely will be going back this summer a few times to this place.  I was in NC on vacation two weeks ago and ate at two BBQ places and they pale in comparison."}
{"text":"Great service and food. The complimentary cornbread is very warm and tasty. Manager Donnie was great and came over to make sure everything was great. Our waitress Tylor was wonderful. She brought us our beverages and kids meal right away. Brisket platter was very good. 
We also enjoyed the donuts for dessert. Everyone seems so happy and wanting to make sure the experience is great."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good about this place, ambiance, service, quality and taste of food, loved, loved, loved it! Price was also very reasonable!"}
{"text":"We were driving by Phoenix and stopped by for a quick dinner. Two of us shared the Saint Louis ribs and the brisket, with coleslaw, Mac and cheese, grilled veggies, beans, corn bread, and frozen lemonade. The meat was tasty, and the grilled veggies and corn bread were perfect. I could've done without the Mac n cheese and beans. Travis took great care of us. He checked on us throughout the meal and sent us home with a refill of the frozen lemonade and a sweet donut treat to go. He went above and beyond in service and in creating a fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"Great food. The waitstaff is also very nice. Their beef ribs are the best I've ever had. The ribs were the meatiest I've ever eaten. I've had ribs at other places where the meet was skimping on them. But Bobby Q's beef ribs were excellent! You can actually pull the tender meat off of the ribs with a fork and knife."}
{"text":"Beyond a doubt, my family's favorite restarurant in Phoenix.  Nicole was an outstanding waitress addressing all of our needs before they ever occurred.  As my youngest says (who's birthday it was), \"This is the best meal I've ever eaten and my most favorite restaurant.\"  Believe it or not, that is the first time he's ever said such a thing.  I'm looking forward to my next meal at Bobby Q's!"}
{"text":"Thank you Taylor & Luke B for your hospitality and great service. The food was amazing, thank you for everything. This was our 1st time, but will continue to be our favorite in Arizona. Alex & Marty Q"}
{"text":"I have literally been here about 15 times or so and this place never disappoints.  In my opinion, this is the best restaurant in Phoenix.  I have tried the baby back ribs and burgers many times and I don't see how it could be any better.  The service is also outstanding and the atmosphere is great.  I would go crazy if Bobby Q ever closes."}
{"text":"Oh man, Yelp did not disappoint me during a weekend trip to the Phoenix area with this place. First of all, they warm you up with free cornbread whilst you decide on what kind of grilled flesh you'd like to consume; it's served with a side of butter but TOTALLY not needed...the cornbread is warm, soft, and buttery as it is. 

On to the main stuff - promove if there's just two of you dining would be the Whole Hog Heaven deal for $38: pick from two meats off of a list of four (the ladyfriend and I picked the beef brisket and sausage), two rib selections out of three (we rolled with the beef ribs and St. Louis-style), and three sides from their list (went with grilled veggies, mac and cheese, and shoestring fries). The brisket had that wonderful, beefy flavor - tender and moist on this particular occasion. Sausage was sausage; nothing spectacular. The beef ribs were good; they were decently sized and definitely meaty. However, we enjoyed the St. Louis-style ribs; these too weren't the pinnacle of ribdom, but these were also tender and delicious. As for the sides: grilled veggies - good, wish we had more; shoestring fries - they were fries; mac and cheese - too cheesy.

Why five stars? Great service, great deal for the amount of food we got, and, as many have noted, WARM DONUTS BEFORE YOU LEAVE. We didn't know about that part until we passed on dessert and received the check. If you feed me a good meal for a good price and give me a fresh treat at the end...well, you're a winner in my book."}
{"text":"Its been a little while since we went to Bobby Q.The food was great so I have no problem there at all,Service was alright I have nothing derogatory to say..However the condiments have a lot to be desired.There were 6 people and they brought 2 baskets of bread no problem and 2 butters in what you could call a cough medicine size cups.The same thing happened when we asked for ketchup 3 of us requested it and again they bring 2 small cough medicine size cups.(keep in mind) You have 2 teenagers and an adult.who like to eat.We asked for a bottle but were told they don't put them out.This is not an inexpensive eatery so when it comes to the condiments there should be no skimping on butter and ketchup..Sorry to say haven't been back since that dinner"}
{"text":"Great food our waitresses Destiny was very helpful. It was my first time here. She went over the menu with us. Answered any questions we had. The spinach dip is scrumptious. I ordered the bqq baked potato with chicken and a side of grilled vegetables delicious. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped by here while at Spring Training, food was delicious, will definitely be back for their BBQ! Service wasgreat too, very friendly :)"}
{"text":"It's our first time in Phoenix and we decided to visit Bobby Q to check it out. I made our reservation from yelp and it worked very well. We even received a 10% discount for checking in thru yelp.

Our meal started with delicious complimentary cornbread. I don't think I have enough words to describe how delicious ALL the food that we ordered specially the BRISKET and Chicken BBQ!
Bobby Q exceeded our expectations! They also have generous portion its good for sharing and worth every buck! HIGHLY recommended for your BBQ cravings!"}

Service - Really nice.

Food - Good but not freakin amazing.
1. Baby Back Ribs - Very tender and meaty.
2. Brisket - Very very good.  Fatty, tender and flavorful.
3. Pulled Pork - Awful and dry.
4. Cornbread - Decent
5. Mac and Cheese - I like mine a little more dry so this was great.
6. Pecan Coleslaw - Boring
7. Potato Salad - Really good
8. Donuts - Nice extra touch."}

The manager came by to make sure we were having a good experience. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly. Special kudos goes to Patrick and Kody who were not only excellent at their job, but very easy on the eyes. I will definitely be going here again and make sure to ask for Patrick, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Travis treated us like royalty from the start to the end of our family dinner for four. He made terrific recommendations and even let us sample some of the sides so we could make just the right choice with our meals. The brisket was delectable, the steak tender and tasty, the ribs were moist and meaty. We simply loved the cornbread and the Q rolls. Travis kept our drinks freshened, but never hovered or made us feel uncomfortable as we enjoyed our meal and family celebration. We are already planning our next visit and plan to ask for Travis by name."}

Hands down the best BBQ!  

Amazing customer service! Had a small issue with the cornbread and the manager came out himself to talk to us and apologize and re"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!! I am not a big meat eater and this place was fantastic!!! We got the pulled pork,pulled beef, coleslaw, corn slaw and corn bread. So so so so good!!! I definitely recommend this place and will come back on my next trip to Arizona!"}
{"text":"Great food, the complimentary donut holes they provide at the end of each meal are delicious. The food is pretty damn great, too. I would recommend that you try the BBQ brisket and pulled pork."}
{"text":"Went for first time tonight. The food was awesome. We ordered \"whole hog heaven\". Had more than enough food for 2. Could have possibly served 3. The ribs fell off the bone. The brisket melted in your mouth. The service was great. Have nothing but good things to say."}
{"text":"Holy Jesus it feels like I'm back in Texas when I'm eating here.  Bobby Q's has the best barbeque in Arizona, hell in the world.  I'm from Texas so I'm kinda picky when it comes to brisket, but Bobby Q's is the only place that does brisket justice in Arizona.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Q- rolls, golden cornbread and pure 100% meaty BBQ - topped it off with a delicious frozen cocktail. We each ordered a two meat entree: pulled pork, beef ribs, and brisket - WOW!!! Sides of ranch beans, macaroni and cheese and shoestring fries - AMAZing. We've been in AZ 6 years and finally gave this place a go without 0 regrets. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I love Bobby Q! The food is delicious. We went tonight, knowing it would be busy, and waited over 40 min to be seated at a high top table in the bar. We had a great server who was very friendly and attentive. Got our waters quickly, followed by the delicious cornbread. I usually order the pulled pork, but this time I decided to get the pulled bbq chicken sandwich with mac & cheese. Didn't take long to get our food. Requested the regular BBQ sauce. The food was good, especially the mac & cheese which is very rich and yummy. Was interesting to see some vapor coming in from a fog machine in the adjacent club. I like the moist towelettes they give you to clean your hands after the meal. And perhaps the best part? The mini donuts! Our server even brought us some extra and offered to get us waters to go. The donuts were hot and scrumptious. Mmm mm! I think they raised their prices since the last time we came, but it's still a good value. Be prepared to leave full and happy."}

{"text":"BBQ brisket and baby back ribs were delish!  My favorite part of the meal was the skinny crispy fries.  Portions are big - be careful how much you order.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This used to be a Bobby McGees, which the waitress will probably tell you its your first time here.Soon after getting settled in, a basket of cornbread, along with soft, whipped butter, landed on the table, & it was incredibly good . We got the breaded fried catfish, and the  baby back ribs which are  my favorite. The food was very tasty and price is pretty average for a combination platter . For our sides we went with the ranch beans, bake potato , and mac n cheese. The sauces My baby back ribs were delicious, but they are too fall off the bone if you get my point. I prefer ribs that still cling to the bone, but can be pulled off easily as well. To each their own. were amazing and the portions are ridiculously small . Other than that I wish I would got more of your breaded fried catfish it was delicious, but one piece of catfish not going to cut it for me. And the doughnuts at the end are just the perfect touch.  Will return maybe ."}
{"text":"If you like BBQ, this is probably the best place I've been to in phoenix.


If you have ever been to Lucille's BBQ in California or tempe it is comparable. Been there about 5 times and everything is good. They have large group deals making it pretty cheap. Also right when you walk in you see a donut making machine, and they give you donuts when you finish your meal which is awesome. Freshly baked and very fluffy. 

I come back often"}
{"text":"Passing through Phoenix, we naturally turned to yelp for what to get. Bobby Q seemed to be a popular option is we decided to go for it. And it did not disappoint.

Went around noon on a Saturday and it wasn't too too packed. There's a nice outdoor area with lights and a fountain of sorts. (would try to avoid the back - sometimes there's one or tow more flies flying around). 

We got the hogs heaven (a family style mix and match) and got the brisket, St Louis ribs, pork and ribs with a couple of sides. And wow it was amazing. Everything is so delicious and just melts in your mouth. The bbq sauce great too. Neither bland nor too sweet. 

On top of it, the service was amazing. Our server was especially nice and took care of us well. Even if she were busy, she'd send another server to check in on us. This place is definitely  a must try."}
{"text":"While we were in town, I had a hankering for some ribs and thought I'd try this place based on the many positive reviews it garnered.

Location & Aesthetics - Located just off the I-17 somewhere I believe in the Glendale area of Phoenix.  Lots of available parking in an enclosed private lot. 
The place has a rustic look and feel to it.  Very spacious inside, clean including the bathrooms, and well lit.   

Menu - menus were quite extensive though my wife and I already knew what we wanted as we had a chance to review their menu online before meeting our friends there.  Menu was self-explanatory and easy to find what one needed, not too overwhelming.

Service - The staff was very friendly.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and was shown a large table to accommodate my wife and I including our friends who had two boys with them.  
I did have a gripe with the table we were seated at as it was a bit wobbly and thankfully my wife noticed too.  It wasn't too bad to shift our meals around so no loss on the ratings.  
Before the meals are brought, they do serve some cornbread with butter in the meantime and though I didn't try it, my wife said it was tasty, delicious, and not too dry or too greasy.

Food - I ordered the full rack of baby back ribs with vegetables and roasted corn.  Initially when I first saw the full rack of ribs I thought I wouldn't be able to eat it but I surprised myself.  My ribs was well cooked and was practically falling off the bone.  It was soft, tender, and juicy and you could even taste the smokiness to the meat.  The roasted corn was well seasoned, more than enough and came in a bowl.  The roasted vegetables that I ordered was lacking and only consisted of a few vegetable that looked like it was about a tablespoonful.  (-1)
My wife ordered the three-meat dish and it was so much that we had to take a bag back to the hotel.  She did comment on how well and delicious it was. 

Rating - 3/5.  The restaurant loses another star/rating based on a small issue.  
After the bills were brought to the table and the waitress ran my credit card, I asked if I can use my Yelp coupon and she stated that I couldn't do so as \"the card had already been run\" which I don't believe.  I couldn't see why she couldn't cancel it and re-run the card with the coupon. (-1)
Despite the 3/5, it's definitely a place I'd like to come back to try some of their pulled pork sandwiches which is what my friends had and looked absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"The Smokehouse burger (minus the BBQ sauce) is the best burger in all of Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is the worst BBQ I've had in a long time I'm originally from Chicago and this is not good barbecue I wonder if they even have a real barbecue pit it doesn't taste like it and really tastes like another version of Famous Dave's matter-of-fact Famous Daves is better will never go there again FYI if you're looking for good BBQ come to Chicago."}
{"text":"I like coming here for dinner. Been here three times and it's always absolutely delicious. I've had the bbq chicken, brisket, sausage and the ribs. They're always wonderful. The service is attentive. 
I cannot eat gluten so I forego the cornbread and the rolls but I am told they are quite good. I also have never been able to try any of their desserts due to my intolerance. 
I really do enjoy their bbq, the sauces are really good. I just wish they offered a couple of GF items, that's why the 4-stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"We (4) ordered the combo platter Whole Hog Heaven $51. The baby back ribs fall off the bone. The beef brisket melts in your mouth. Very delicious. One of best BBQ I had."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Chelsea the bartender and Ashlynn the server! If you go there I would ask for those two. They make the whole experience even better! The food is awesome and the donuts are delicious."}
{"text":"We LOVE Bobby q's!!!!!!!! We always have such great service every time we go and the food is always amazing!!!! The servers are always willing to accommodate and are so sweet when we bring our kids (they even throw in a couple extra doughnuts for them) we have made Bobby Q's one of our regulars and recommend it to everyone! So great!"}
{"text":"We have lived In Phoenix for 10 years and have driven by hundreds of times as we driven down I-17.  We finally stopped in yesterday and WOW!  The atmosphere, service (thanks Jo), and especially the food which was nothing less than phenomenal! My steak was better than any steak I've eaten at any major steak house. Ribs were incredible, and their sides are amazing. Great portion sizes, and you get a lot of food for their prices.  Then hard part is finding how to get there; the Dunlap exit is the key to success.  We cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"This is our second time visiting Bobby Q's and once again, it was a tasty experience and a great break from our drive to Sedona. Our group was large, so we called for reservations (recommended since they are busy, especially over the holidays). We had lunch both times and the food was delicious and the portions were generous. 

You would expect the main entrees to be tasty, but the extras were also great. My sister-in-law was still talking about their cornbread a week later, but personally I'm a bigger fan of their free cinnamon donuts. We had the combo platters with a full range from the pulled chicken, brisket, pork, ribs and smoked sausage. Everyone enjoyed their food. 

The service was excellent and a great example of how a well run restaurant should operate. Everyone from the server to the manager were focused on ensuring we had a great time.

We've continue to enjoy our visits to Bobby Q's. This is now a mandatory stop whenever we are in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Ordered the three meats and two sides and nothing disappointed! Brisket wasn't full of fat like most places but instead tender, St. Louis ribs were fall of the bone! Had it w the Not spicy bbq and Chipotle's ranch and it was the best I ever had. 

Travis was as our server and was unbelievably patient and well informed! One of the best all around servers we have ever had at a restaurant and will be a major cause for returning.

The restaurant is clean and tidy with a wonderful ambience of not to loud of a bar area or annoyingly loud country music"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ in the valley. Whole hog heaven was awesome and our server sawyer anticipated our needs perfectly."}
{"text":"We enjoy out BBQ and have eaten the \"Q\" all over. In addition I have my own smoker and have taken classes from some fine pit men and competition winners from KC and Memphis. I really enjoy the meat here but was very disappointed when we ordered a selection of pork ribs, brisket and beef ribs for a trip to Utah. We wanted some good food while hiking the parks. Everything was great except the beef ribs. We got 6 ribs with NO MEAT. I mean literally NO MEAT just smoked bones. If you ever had smoked beef ribs you know that there is a solid 3/4 to 1 inch thick strip of meat on the top side of the rib. The ones from here were stripped to the bone with only a little meat on the side. They ended up being expensive dog treats. everything else was great. DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON BEEF RIBS.  Always great service and drinks."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere, tons of parking, and the food is awesome.

We tried the Whole Hog heaven ($51). The Whole hog heaven is too much for one person. We tried getting one 'whole hog' each but no way anyone could come close to finishing it individually. Leftovers for a few more meals!

The brisket is amazing, just incredible, juicy, melt in mouth-type of meat, I personally think I would come back just to eat this. Baby back ribs are so good, I actually enjoy less fat vs the St Louis. The sausage is also super tastyans juicy.

The sides like potato salad, pecan cole slaw, and grilled veggies were solid."}
{"text":"For the size of the portions the food is overpriced.  The food tasted ok but it's nothing to write home about.  Texas Roadhouse and even Famous Daves blows them away.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Navigating the parking lot and figuring out which door to go in was interesting the first trip, but once inside, I liked the decor. High ceilings with obligatory (this IS Phoenix after all) yet interesting leaf-looking fans, huge wood doors (non-functional) and unique and interesting antique pieces definitely added to the overall feel of the place for me.  I like places with some character.  Though the contrast with the more modern and trendy tables, chairs and centerpieces on the tables along with the high-energy model-slim all-in-black with plunging necklines waitstaff was odd for me.  I mean, pretty is pretty, but I'm looking for tasty food and a warm welcome, not warmth anywhere else if you know what I'm saying (that's what places like Hooters were made for, no?).  I'm a bit more low-key when I dine out, though I must compliment the attentiveness and overall service.  My iced tea glass was never empty and \"to go\" boxes (with Thank-Q donuts) were promptly brought when requested (eyes always bigger than stomach).

Now - the food.  Definitely the place to go when you're craving really tender meat. The brisket is divine and they had me at pulled pork. Seriously. Meat roasted for 18 hours and I didn't have to do it myself? Heaven!! Now everyone seems to rave about the mac & cheese, but personally I am in love with the ranch beans - with pieces and shreds of brisket and pork in it. I was surprised at how tasty it was. I'd do takeout just for that.  The spinach artichoke dip was a bit high-fat for me and I had to stop after a few bites though my dining companion was happy to finish it off. Tasty but heavy.  The peach cobbler was not my choice, but I did have some and it was ok for what it was but it didn't wow me.

I will definitely be back for more brisket, pulled pork and ranch beans, but I may just as well get it \"to go.\""}
{"text":"Great ambience, seated quickly, and the drinks and food came out super fast after we ordered. We got the Whole Hog Heaven--baby back ribs, beef ribs, pulled pork, and brisket--to share between us two and we absolutely demolished that platter. In like 10 minutes. It was that good. Everything was incredible, ESPECIALLY the baby back ribs, and their BBQ sauce is my latest favorite. Our server, Tanner, was nice and attentive. They give you a little bag of donuts after, but I haven't tried them yet since there's literally no room for anything else in my stomach."}
{"text":"My parents love coming here when they're in town. There is almost always a wait, so I highly recommend making reservations. The service is always good and the bbq... well, its pretty delicious. You can't go wrong with the St. Louis style ribs or the Pulled Pork- the Brisket, however, was a little dry on our last visit. You will definitely have left overs, so sharing isn't a bad idea. ****4 Stars."}
{"text":"I came back here for a date night with my wife. Call it an early valentine's day.  We made a reservation and we're seated quickly. 
The ambiance was loud but I expected that from how busy they were.
We started with the Cajun shrimp. They were delicious.  Perfectly seasoned with just a bit of bite.
My wife had the sirloin with baked potatoe and grilled veggies. She thoroughly enjoyed it. 
I had the 3 meat combo with brisket,  pulled pork,  baby back ribs, baked potatoe and roasted corn. The corn tasted just like it came off a grill. The potatoe was delicious and it was gone before I started on the meat. The meat was perfect.  A little more sauce would have been nice but it was great.
The service this time around was much better."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here while visiting AZ from CA.  We actually used Yelp to find the place.  I have had alot of bbq, and this is BY FAR, the absolute best I have ever eaten.  Try the Q Rolls, then get the Baby back ribs.  You will not need desert trust me."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner at Bobby Q in Phoenix area. Highly recommend everything here. Great ribs, brisket, chicken and sides. Great waiter named Luke, ask for him! Manager Taylor was great too got us in earlier than our reservation and attended to our needs. Great experience !"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ.  I recently had the three meat combo. Baby back ribs were excellent, brisket had nice smoke flavor but was a bit fatty (for my taste), hot link was good.  Wouldn't go too far out of my way to back but if I lived nearby I'd be a regular.  The thank Q donuts are a nice touch."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service, and those mini donuts at the end are to die for.  Go check it out and you will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Such a fun place for my husband's birthday dinner! We made a reservation, showed up to the restaurant, and were taken to our table in a very timely and welcoming way. I had the prime rib- excellently prepared! My husband had the baby back ribs and loved them. The manager came around and greeted us. Since we were first timers, she brought out a sample of the brisket for us to try. Wow! We'll be ordering that when we return. After talking to us, the manager brought us dessert after finding out we were celebrating a birthday. We definitely felt welcomed, and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"5 stars are meant for restaurants like these!!

I went to Buckeye, AZ for business and contacted my friend that goes to pharmacy school in AZ and told him \"I'm hungry. Where should I go\". Without hesitation he recommend me here!

I am really satisfied and happy he recommended me Bobby Q!

The brisket, baby back ribs and baked potato is AMAZING!

The staff is very friendly and the service is excellent!

I will definitely go back when I'm in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and have always had a pleasant experience with staff. Food is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Excellent! My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with this hidden gem. Ordered a combination plate which consisted of three meats, one side, and cornbread. The meat was so so good and fell apart. 

If you're ever in Phoenix stop by and have the best meal experience ever! Price and food portions were perfect! Service was great everyone made sure that we were taken care of...trust me if you want a great meal come and get it!"}
{"text":"A great find here in Phoenix.  Our waitress Joe was great, and we received free donuts on our way out!"}
{"text":"oh my god....this place is heaven on earth. i could eat their ribs/brisket/cornbread/peach cobbler every day for the rest of my life and i would not be disappointed. as i'm writing this im salivating/foaming at the mouth thinking about sticky bbq sauce on my fingers and in my mouth. visual.

three of us got here during dinner on a weekday, seated promptly. had sweet tea and a strawberry lemonade (tasted like fresh lemonade and was addicting with a sugar rim!). Cornbread was served - delicious, sweet, buttery.

Next came a a 50/50 order of beef ribs/brisket with roasted corn and baked beans, a 50/50 of brisket/baby back ribs with walnut coleslaw and mac & cheese, and a pulled chicken sandwich. 

Long story short, orgasms ensued. The beef ribs I had, were fall off the bone tender, smoky, slathered in perfect amounts of sauce, and just so so so so damn juicy and cooked like they said they do it. The meat just fell off when I bit into it, and the bbq sauce was so sweet and perfect. I would dunk all the food I ever eat for the rest of my life in this sauce. Probably the best ribs I ever had. The brisket was delicious, fork tender, not dry at all (close to the best I've ever had). The beans were porky, smokey, and flavorful, and the roasted corn was so so deliciously roasted.

Finished the night off with a peach cobbler, which was pretty much illegal. Ice cream melted into a deliciously cinnamon nutmeg concoction of sweetness and cobbler, the most perfect grandma-made style cobbler 
I've ever had. Not too tart, not too sweet, just perfect. 

Best BBQ i ever had. LEGIT"}
{"text":"Bobby Q is an awesome place. The environment is amazing - and the bartender Billy was incredible. The food here is top notche'. The people in here were incredibly nice and engaging and when ever I come back to this area I will be back. Lastly, when checking in on yelp, you'll get 10% off your bill."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and the staff is always friendly. I love the corn bread and the fresh mini donuts that you get on the way out."}
{"text":"Sat down, waited 15 minutes, left. Informed hostesses at front we'd waited, too busy chatting about their boyfriends to bother."}
{"text":"The server we had was by far the best server ever. This guy was on his game. Then we had a manager stop by for a quality check up. It wasn't over the top but just nice that they cared to follow up. I had a beef brisket sandwhich with a 22oz Fresh Squeezed IPA and my brother had a pulled look sanwhich with coleslaw and sweet tea. They served warm complementary cornbread with butter and finished the meal with cinnamon mini donuts. My beef brisket sandwhich was moist and cooked well. The bun was the sugary white bread and not totally unique (not 5star) but still tasted good. There is better BBQ but this was a good lunch. I will say, my brother remarked that the price seemed a bit high but I think this is pretty standard for most BBQ spots. The server we had was spot on. I wish I knew his name. I'd recommend this guy move to fine dinning and that Bobby's holds on to him. You'll notice him from other establishments. This is the waiter that cares."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Best barbecue around! Two meat combo with brisket and pulled pork is awesome. Mac and cheese is heavenly. So good i can never bring myself to order anything different! Went in yesterday for Valentines tradition with my hub, and Zac was our server - I guess its his second week there, but he was a pro! Great service, great atmosphere, and killer food! What more can you ask for? Id give this place a hundred stars if i could. :)"}
{"text":"Place is amazing.  This is definitely our come to place everytime we're in town for spring training"}
{"text":"We found Bobby Q's by accident and couldn't be more pleased. Our food was fantastic! The Q rolls are to die for! The service was amazing, so was the atmosphere. Oh yah, and the hot donuts to finish it off, yummy!"}
{"text":"I miss Little Bo Peep and the rest of the character servers of the late Bobby McGee's!!! I miss the private and romantic individual seating areas. I miss the salad bar and the food of yesterday!! If you have been around the area for a while, you know what I mean. If not, you missed out BIG TIME!! Bobby Q took Bobby McGee's out and I'm still depressed about it over a decade later!! Bobby Q, you do not impress me much.

Like many others, I do not understand the hype or the love of this place at all, whatsoever, NOPE, not now and I never will!!! Their meat is \"moist\" alright, to the point of no texture and you could feed it to a TOOTHLESS infant!!! I like some texture and a lot more smoke flavor!!!

I especially do NOT like the donuts they serve after your dinner. They are greasy and mush much like their meat. My young kid said they made his \"stomach sick.\" Their cornbread is good, but I make mine from a boxed pre-mix and add a can of creamed corn and a small can of drained green chili's (only the 3 ingredients) and I like it BETTER!! 

I give them two stars only because for lunch they have a good deal. You can get a brisket or pork sandwich with a side for $9.00. The atmosphere is nice and the service is good so I might return for lunch, but not very often and ONLY if I happen to be driving right by. I will NOT go out of my way to eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Over the years this upscale barbeque restaurant has gone downhill. Perhaps it was simply that they were too busy that Saturday evening, but food was sloppily served and overly salty. Worse,, it lacked character; for example the wedge salad was lacking blue cheese and tomato, leaving a chunk of uninteresting iceberg. Evidently, the management has come to the strange notion that throwing onion straws on things makes them worth eating."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, and fell in love with the place.

Our server Raymond was super friendly and commented repeatedly on how they Love Yelp here.  Hey Gabi, this would be a great place for an official Elite Event, and they have an attached nightclub!

On to the food.  Ray suggested the Q-Rolls appetizer, and it didn't disappoint.  They're like flautas made with brisket, accompanied by two dipping sauces.  Simply Amazing!

Ray also recommended the whole hog entree with brisket, pulled-pork and baby backs.  It was large enough for my wife and I to share.  Delicious and filling.  My daughter ordered the half chicken plate, and their fries are superb.

We finished it off with a peach cobbler, and to our surprise, we were presented with a bag of Thank-Q's (accompanying our check), which were freshly made dough balls coated in cinnamon & sugar.  Very good!

If we lived closer, we'd be a fixture in this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Brisket was amazing, rest was just okay. Ambience on the patio was phenomenal. Stopped in for lunch on our way thru, four generations of my family have eaten here thru the years and I was the last and told we had to try it if we passed thru. So glad we did. Parking is abundant. Bathrooms are super clean and so neat in the decor."}
{"text":"Ridiculously the Best 1st Time Experience of My Life!  This was My Last Stop Before Heading Back to  L.A. The Front Desk at THE CROWNE PLAZA Highly Recommended this Place Since I was Here on a Business Trip. I Was Ready to Head Back to PAPPADEAUX'S SEAFOOD KITCHEN for the 3RD Time this Weekend and I'm Soooo Glad I Took Their Advice! 

 MONIQUE Was My Server.  And Not Only Was She On Top of Her Game and Answered My Questions with the Conviction of a Preacher Giving A Sermon on a Sunday,  But She was as Beautiful as the Heavanly CORN BREAD She Brought Me and My Client!  For Starters the Q-ROLL'S Were SCRUMPTIOUSLY Delicious with 2 Different Sauces! The MIX COMBO MEAT PLATTER of BEEF BRISKET AND PULLED PORK Was Off the Chain JUICY and FORK TENDER! The BOBBY Q CHEESE BURGER that My Client Ordered was As Thick, Juicy and Made To Order as Any I Have Ever Laid Eyes On! Unfortunately,  I Wasn't Prepared to Handle Desert, (THERE VERSION OF BANANA CREAM PIE,  OUCH!) Especially Since I Had a 5 Hour Road Trip Back to La La. CAN I SAY FOOD COMA!  NOT! I'm Not Gonna Get Pulled Over By ARIZONA HIGHNOON PATROL For a DUI A La BOBBY Q! 
And If You Even Think that I'm Over Playin' My Hand then Just Head Over There and Call My Bluff! 

Like General Douglas Mac Arthur said to the People of the Philippines in WWII or Arnold Schwarzenegger said in The Terminator... \"I'LL BE BACK\"!"}
{"text":"There aren't enough words to describe how amazing and delicious this restaurant is! You would be crazy not to come here. Not only is the food top notch all of the employees are super friendly and helpful! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Both times were awesome experiences. The food is absolutely amazing, service great, and price is on target for the experience.  I had the pulled pork and my friend had the brisket.  Both were tender and juicy.  Both of us agreed the best BBQ we've probably ever had.  We will be back, lots."}
{"text":"To give a brief background, my fiancé and I just moved to the valley from Tennessee where BBQ and southern cookin' is done right. I had read a lot of great reviews about this place and since my soon-to-be hubby is a self-proclaimed BBQ connoisseur, I decided to take him here as a spontaneous mid-week treat.

It's a pretty neat location.. They definitely  nailed down-home, country vibe that they were going for. 

I wouldn't say the food was sub par by any means, but it didn't knock our socks off like the authentic, southern eats we're accustomed to. Sweet tea was off, mild BBQ sauce was WAY to sweet. Meat was okay, but nothing amazing. Service was decent. Mac n cheese was money. 

My guess is that the people who typically  eat here haven't lived in the South where this type of food is an absolute art form.

This location isn't particularly close to where we live so probably won't be back anytime soon but we are curious to try out Little Miss next!"}
{"text":"Baby back ribs are amazing. Flavor and tenderness is 10/10. Best I've ever had. Mac n Cheese was absolutely delicious! Again, best I've ever had. Loaded mashed potatoes were good and corn bread was great. Customer service was on point. If I could, i'd give this place a 6/5 because of the atmosphere (restaurant side)."}
{"text":"I have been trying to find a good BBQ place, and I have drove by and seen the sign driving north on the I-17 many times but reluctant to try because of my past experiences with BBQ places. Honey Bear BBQ has nothing on this place, HB BBQ pulled pork was dry and their sauce was too vingeary and not as thick, I was very disappointed, but until I tried BOBBY Q's...I was impressed with the decor,  and it was a nice day so we sat outside on the charming open patio with a trickling water fountain near us. The food is cheaper during the week but weekends is a bit more expensive....there is too much to tell, you just have to try for yourself, you wont be disappointed.... and you get a free little dessert as you leave ( freshly made mini sugar doughnuts) YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Out here in Arizona for a work trip and found this place on Yelp and it definitely lived up to the reviews. Great food and great service from our Server Kyle! Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"The service was amazing!! We tried two appetizers, the Q rolls and then the artichoke queso dip and both of those were amazing. Everyone's food was great and the Mac n cheese was so good. All in all, definitely a place to stop by if you are in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, nice atmosphere. What else do you expect? Definitely coming back for more. Officially one of my favorite spots now after the first time."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  This place has THE BEST BBQ I have ever tasted and my husband and I eat a lot of BBQ!  We had the Q Rolls for an appetizer and they were different than anything we ever had but were good!  For dinner we ordered the Whole Hog Heaven plate which consisted (our choice) of beef ribs, spare ribs and double brisket and let me tell you, cooked to perfection, smoked to perfection and after 1-2 days left overs, still bomb.com!!!  However I did not care for the beans or mashed potatoes.  Not very tasty but the Mac n cheese was good and very creamy!  I highly recommend this place.  I live in So Cal and would make a special trip out to Az for this place!"}
{"text":"We have lived in Phoenix for 10+ years and have driven by Bobby Q hundreds of times as we have driven down I-17.  Finally we stopped in yesterday and WOW!  The atmosphere, service (thanks Jo), and especially the food which was nothing less than phenomenal! My steak was better than any steak I've eaten at any major steak house. Ribs were incredible, and their sides are amazing. Great portion sizes, and you get a lot of food for their prices. The hard part was actually finding out how to get there from off I-17; the Dunlap exit is the key to success!  We cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"We discovered Bobby Q because it was recently highly rated nationally in the NY Times. The ribs and brisket were tops of the night - we ordered the sample platter with two ribs, two meats and 3 sides. The St. Louis ribs and Baby Backs both were perfectly booked and bathed luxuriously in an excellent barbeque sauce - my wife with regular, me with the hot version. Very friendly service, and lots of happy people. Joe's in Gilbert and Bobby Q in Phoenix... two great reasons to live in the Valley of the BBQ Sun. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was by far some of the best most amazing delicious melt-in-your-mouth barbecue that I have ever ever had. Fantastic looking restaurant. Fantastic staff. Amazing service. Everything was delicious. And very reasonable. I I highly recommend the two meat combo."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The baby back ribs and St. Louis ribs , along with the brisket are our favorites. We came the 1st time on Easter and couldn't wait to come back. The staff and atmosphere of the restaurant are very welcoming."}
{"text":"Being from TX I'm always looking for good BBQ! Bobby Q had amazing BBQ! Make sure you ask for Ashlynn. Her personality is not only 2nd to none I informed her that I was on the clock and even with a Saturday lunch rush she got my food to me in less time than it took for me to read the table tent. The mgr was also seen more than once roaming and making sure everything was perfect.  I don't normally post reviews but made an exception in this case. Very well done!"}
{"text":"Me and my crew of 4 went here after a Cardinals game.

Pros:
-Large space
-Nice servers
-Huge selection menu, good enough to split between 2-3 people
-Sporty, had the games on
-Tasty sauces 

Cons:
-We were stuffed after just a few bites
-Very Very far!
-Mac and Cheese was underwhelming

I would only try Bobby Q again if were in the area but will not make a point to drive from the East Valley."}
{"text":"The most amazing bbq and restaurant in Phoenix. Do not let the neighborhood fool you! The atmosphere once inside is great and the workers are always on the ball and friendly. We eat lunch there once a week and sometimes on the weekend as well. The food is amazing and always fresh! I have to say that I have yet to eat something that I didn't like. 

Appetizers:Must have the Q-Rolls or the Spinach and Artichoke Dip
Sandwiches-Cant go wrong with the Brisket
Fully loaded baked potato is amazing!
Dinner-Filet Mignon or the Chicken Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes
Sides-MAC AND CHEESE PEOPLE! Corn or the Ranch Beans.

I think I should work for this company as I am very passionate about what they serve and the customer service.

IF you are looking for night life try the club that opens up after the restaurant closes. They provide bottle service and will even do balloons for the tables that you reserve. They have the most amazing street tacos that are served around midnight!

I hope that someone is reading this review and heading there now! Don't forget to try the amazing mini-doughnuts that are made fresh and served to you complimentary."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ experiences I've had in a long time. Thanks for,the amazing food and terrific service.  Came from out of state and was here only a few hours, but I will go out of my way to eat here again.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Everything was great from A to Z....even scored some free sugared doughnuts upon arrival just by asking. Our seating was prompt even though we were told it would be fifteen minutes - we barely waited three...

our booth was awesome and so was our server Hunter...who was very kind, courteous and knowledgeable without being obtrusive or pushy. He made just the right recommendations and was very polite while engaging.

The winner of the evening was the moist and plump rotisserie chicken, accompanied by the two sides which were shoestring fries and mac n cheese. The chicken was to die for and made all the supermarket rotisserie chickens look bad...the chicken was not only juicy but it was supremely tender and melt in your mouth - too bad there wasn't more of it...

The only thing I didn't care for was the corn bread but that's not enough to knock off a star...

Good night !"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch on the way back to LA. Can't believe how great the food was. Got the 3(brisket,bbq chicken, st. Louis ribs) meats and 1 side with 1 cornbread. Everything tasted amazing, the brisket and the ribs basically melted in my mouth. Also had very great, attentive, and friendly service. Anytime I'm in Aizona, this is my place to be."}
{"text":"Stuck in the hospital in Phoenix last month and our amazing friends brought us a takeout smorgasbord from Bobby's...we hadn't physically been there in almost 2 years and the uber-high standard is definitely being maintained."}
{"text":"This place lives up to all the hype and then more.  So I called ahead to make a reservation.   We actually arrived 30 mins early and they still took us in right away--even with a full patio of people waiting to be seated.

Our server was very helpful and attentive.  We ordered the Hog Heaven and it was enough for us--5 people (2 adults and 3 kids).  

I usually am not too crazy about BBQ stuff, but Hubby likes this stuff....,I actually liked the food.  I would totally return when back in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"It had been a while since the last time we had barbecue, so we decided to make an 8 PM Saturday night reservation at Bobby Q. We were very pleased with all the meats we sampled and the Yelp rating didn't let us down.

We had about a fifteen minute wait after we checked in at the host stand just after 8. The waiting areas were crowded and many people were waiting outside. I think a buzzer/text system would save some young ladies' voices and annoyance of the guests because when a table became available, the hostesses would yell out the name of the party at the top of their lungs while walking through waiting area.

We were served by Hunter and he did an excellent job of handling being triple sat with a total of 12 guests by treating the multiple tables as he should and serving all of us as one party of 12. He gave us a brief background of the restaurant also informing us that all the meat is smoked for over 20 hours using mesquite wood. The recommendations for food and beverage were solid. During the meal, my daughter did drop her fork on the ground and we requested on three different occasions for a new one and it was never brought to us.

For drink, I started with the Bobby Q's amber ale by Thunder Canyon Brewery which the caramel and malty flavor was an excellent pairing with the barbecue. Along with the warm cornbread to start, we were recommended the Q-Rolls ($10.50) which were a great preview of the meats to come ahead. The brisket was tender and moist wrapped in a crispy shell with a little kick added with a chipotle dip.

For entrees, my wife and I split the Whole Hog Heaven ($48) which was way too much food for two. All four of us could have split this meal. They were out of sausage that night so we went with the pork to go along with the baby back ribs, St. Louis ribs, and brisket. All of the meat was smoky, tender, and juicy. No tough, dry meat here. The sauce was pretty standard and served in a small pot which eliminated the sticky, messy bottles. My daughter and her friend split the Southern Fried Chicken ($14). I didn't get to taste any of the chicken, but they finished everything, which usually isn't the case.

We passed on dessert as everyone was stuffed, but the bag of doughnuts was a nice parting gift which I finished pretty much the whole bag later as a late night snack."}
{"text":"Food is way too expensive but fun atmosphere. It turns into a really cool nightclub after hours but every night is Latin night and a little diversity would increase business greatly. It used to be way better like 5 years ago. A lot classier of a crowd."}
{"text":"Oh my... You have to try the baby back ribs and the sautéed mushrooms are wonderful.  We always get it for take-out."}
{"text":"Havent been here in years really strict on dress code basically if your a girl who doesnt wear heels and dresses dont go"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, you can 100% taste the fact that they smoke the meat for so long, it is a little expensive but I would say it is worth the splurge and leaving with your pants being a little tight. Only reason I'm not leaving a 5 Star review is just because the wait time for the food was a little long, but that can be over looked because the food itself was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Complimentary cornbread and donuts.

Nuff said. 

OK. There's more! Like the Ronco commercial...\"But wait, there's MORE!\"

We had trouble finding the front door. Looks it's sweltering hot and our brains were in meltdown. We entered the To Go door which is a very tiny room for take out service only. The lovely employee upon hearing our door troubles said we could come behind the counter and enter the dining room. What? We don't have to go outside again? Love her. She led us right to a perfect table and provided us with menus. Great service! Make it happen!

I was surprised and impressed by the upscale decor. Kind of reminded me of the House of Blues in West Hollywood...made to look like a shack from the outside but quite luxurious inside. Nice. 

Our server Kellee was Killer!!! I wanted to snatch her away. Oops, I said snatch. Anyway, the pulled pork sandwich with mac n cheese was Bobby Q perfection as was Rickie's brisket sandwich with shoestring fries...the fries...so so yummy! Sweet tea, actually, well, how do you say...should be called super, really, alotta, sweet tea. Sweeter than Paula Deen's pie. Wait. That didn't sound right. 

Bobby Q. I wuv you! 

P.S. Did I detect a little Velveeta in the mac n cheese? Me thinks so and ME LIKEY!"}
{"text":"After reading several reviews about how good the brisket was I decided I had to try it. I went over on a Friday afternoon and sat at the bar. They had the lunch menu and their dinner menu and I noticed the lunch brisket was only around three dollars less expensive then the brisket platter. The bartender said that the dinner platter was a better value so that's what I went with. I opted for the fries and the coleslaw as the two sides. I have to say the brisket was amazing. Not only was it very tender but it was not at all dried out like so many other places that I have tried. Even people from Texas would be impressed.  My only minor complaint was the fries could have been crispier. I also have to say that I really like their ice tea as well. 

There are so many interesting options on the menu I deafly will be coming back to this place to try them out.  

I haven't been to Bobby Q's for a few years. The last time was meeting up with friends from work for a going away party. They had a special room in the back for us. The appetizers we had were very good.

This place has really nice atmosphere. It would be a great place to bring somebody for that first date. Service is also very good. When I was finished the bartender gave me a fresh iced tea to go. That was greatly appreciated on a hot day. 

Their busiest day of the year was Father's Day. I was there at about 2:30 pm and the wait was between an hour and a half and hour and 45 minutes long so I didn't stay but I knew I would have to come back soon. And I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"Had a great time with friends and family. The food was absolutely excellent: tender and flavorful. The brisket is a must.
Stacey, our server, was wonderful.
I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"we celebrated my birthday all weekend.  we made the trek to bobby q on sunday. I ordered the brisket sandwich with mac and cheese and let me tell you about that mac & cheese..it was amazing. Mr H went with the chicken and brisket and for his sides: beans and potato salad.  
The food is sinfully delicious! I will NOT be coming here as often as I would like... I found it too indulgent. it is definitely a treat and worth trying! I love those little donuts they give you at the end!"}
{"text":"The closest thing to spending an entire day prepping and smoking the meat myself.... minus all the work. Great food at a very reasonable price. Our server (Cameron ) was on top of everything. We will be back even though we live over an hour away!"}
{"text":"So glad they opened back up!!! We first went to Bobby Q when we were visiting family in Westport and latterly ate there almost every day of our vacation.  When we heard they'd closed we were devastated. Well, we're back for s vacation and we're totally excited they reopened in Norwalk!!! The service at lunch was great and the food was everything we'd remembered! Can't wait to come back!! Anything and everything on the menu is amazing!"}
{"text":"Totally impressed by this place! We stopped from out of town as we were passing through Phoenix. First off, the staff is fantastic. So friendly, super responsive, and kind. So kind. I've never been a huge lover of BBQ but after eating here, I can't wait to come back! The brisket and pulled pork.... YUMM. The coleslaw is perfect, and the baked potatoes are so perfectly loaded. My boys thought it was very interesting that there was ice in the urinals.... ha ha. The manager even took the time to explain the reason for this!
Seriously, I can see why this place is rated so high. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"A good friend of mine -who's opinion on Q I highly respect- was in town a few months ago and stopped into Bobby Q's (BQ), and he couldn't stop raving about it. I've been jonesing all week to come check it out, but I figured I'd wait until my wife got into town. Well, I finally got my chance and I was giddy as a school girl. I was actually able to make a reservation through OpenTable on the Yelp app, and I'm sure glad we did. Upon our arrival at 5:30 the place was already packed, but by thetime we left at 7 there was a hoard of people flooding out into the street--and for good reason! Enough jibber-jabber--on to the food! I ordered the Three Meat Combo and that comes with two sides and some of BQ's Cornbread.

Sides:

Mac and Cheese- This might easily be the creamiest, most decadent Mac & Cheese I've ever had. They use something similar to Velveeta Cheese to coat it, and I'm not slamming Velveeta. It's so rich I couldn't finish it. 3.75*

Pecan Coleslaw- I'm very picky about my slaw; I don't want it too creamy, sweet, or bitter and this was absolutely perfect! I also loved the crunch you get from the little pieces of toasted Pecan they add to the top--I'm definitely adding that to my slaw the next time I make it. 5*

Cornbread- Excellent mix of a Northern/Southern cornbread--it has the cakiness and slight sweetness if Northern, and the crust and stone-ground corn like a Southern; I could eat these everyday. 5* 

Meat:

St. Louis Ribs- These might be the best St. Louis Pork Ribs (other than mine) that I've ever had! The meat had a nice \"tug\" to it, but was still so tender, smokey and delicious! 5*

Beef Brisket- Juicy and flavorful this brisket was quite good--my only gripe is I wish it had a bit more smokiness to it. 4*

Pulled Pork- Another excellent job by BQ! Juicy, smoky and porky (just like me!) Everything you could want in Pulled Pork and then some. I piggled (sic) the whole lot of it! 5*

Dessert:

Sugar-Cinnamon Donuts- They give everyone at the table these tiny little donuts that they make fresh up front and they're fabulous; they had me at \"Cinnamon\". I guess you can just walk in and order a dozen for $3 if that's all your craving, too. 5*

Service & Ambiance- Good service from our server, Jessica. She was on top of things without being annoying. BQ is located in a building that looks like something you'd find in the middle of nowhere. The interior is mostly brick and wood causing the noise level in there to be deafening by the end of the night. They also keep it a bit too dark for my liking, but the decor is swell. 4*-service/3.5*-Ambiance

Value- The meals here are not a bad value, as my Three Meat Combo cost $22, but it's more than enough food for 2 people. Even my piggy self couldn't finish it--but guess what's for breakfast?! Snooch to the Nooch! 4*

I'm about to make a bold proclamation: I think BQ has *the* best BBQ I've ever had. I don't make that statement lightly either--after all, I have a reputation to uphold. I think this was easily the best meal I've had here in AZ, and that's saying something. I can't wait for my next visit to the Valley of the Sun so I can visit BQ again. If you ever find yourself in Phoenix, I highly, highly recommend making your way here--just make sure to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! We had the whole hog platter. 2 meats, 2 kinds of ribs and 3 sides. We shared it between 2 adults and an 11 year old and still couldn't finish! It wasn't for lack of trying though! The hits start with the corn bread and roll on from there! The sides were just ok, I'd love to see fried okra, but let's face you come here for the meat!! We had baby back ribs, beef ribs, brisket and pork. The baby backs were TO DIE FOR! Falling off the bone with just enough yummy crunchy bark. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite! I highly recommend you take home a jug of sauce to impress your friends at your next back yard gig. Did I mention the tiny hot fresh donuts they bring with the check?! Yumm! Our server Lexi was super knowledgeable and the service was much faster than anticipated on a busy Friday night."}
{"text":"We were her Apr 16, 2016 with a business group of eight.  Service was excellent.  Brisket was fork tender. The O-Rolls (?) appetizer was awesome.  The next time I drive to PHX, I'll return for take out."}
{"text":"First off, I want to say how amazing the food is here! I have never ordered something I didn't like. My favorite item would have to be the Hot wings appetizer. I love the sauce they use! 
Secondly, the staff has always been attentive and made sure my night was well taken care of and that I always had something to drink.
Lastly, I had incident happen tonight that was handled so wonderfully! The manager made sure I came out of there with a smile on my face by having the meal paid by them. At first, the incident had me so mad but once the manager spoke so kind to me, my anger went right away! I never had someone care so much at any restaurant.

I will undoubtedly be a forver returning customer!

If you enjoy great atmosphere, food, and staff, go to Bobby Qs! You definitely wont regret it!

Thank you to all that made my dinner date amazing!


A very pleased customer."}
{"text":"My friend Kate M. had mentioned that she had wanted to have lunch here sometime.  Today, the stars aligned and we (wife and son) drove down here to meet Kate and her husband for a late lunch.  This place has always piqued my interest, and honestly, I'm not sure why I never had lunch/dinner here before.  We drove down and met them at 2pm.

Kate and her husband were already there and grabbed us a table and high chair for our son Bill.  They had ordered Some Q-Rolls (basically an egg roll stuffed with smoked brisket) and some drinks already and offered me up a Q-Roll.  These things were good!  They serve them with chipotle and a bbq sauce.  I could definitely see myself eating a whole order of these things.  

I had read some reviews of this place and it sounded like most people enjoyed the ribs.  Who doesn't like ribs?  I decided to go with the 2 Rib Combo (St. Louis and baby back) which came with 2 sides.  I chose ranch beans and french fries for my sides.  Had a Diet Pepsi to drink.  My wife ordered a brisket sandwich and some mac and cheese for her side.  Pretty much ordered the fries and mac and cheese for our son.  You will have to read Kates review about what she and her husband ordered ;-).  Before they bring out your food, they give you a basket of cornbread.  This stuff was great!  I ate 2 pieces of it and could have ate more.  Anyways....on to the main dishes.  Here is how everything was...............

Rib Combo-  Delicious!  These ribs were so tender they fell off the bone.  I know some BBQ purists will say that ribs should not fall off the bone, but I don't give a shit...these ribs were delicious!  I ate the baby backs first.  They were awesome!  They came covered in minimal sauce so the meat really stood out.  I dug straight in with my hands and would just pick pieces of meat off the bone and savor every bite.  They were delicious and I can see why so many people order them here.  After the baby backs, I got into the St. Louis style ribs.  These were not as good as the baby backs, but they were still pretty damn tasty.  They were cooked so well, that even up at the cartilage portion, there was minimal of it and you could pick through and get every single little morsel of meat.  All that was left on the plate was pretty much bones and a few pieces of cartilage.  These ribs were 5 star ribs!

Sides-  This is where I was a little let down.  I love, love, love some good beans.  I prefer some baked beans, lots of sauce, cooked well done so they are thick, and lots of scraps of meat throughout.  These beans had some meat in them, but they were \"ranch style\" beans and just alright....a little runny.  The sauce was good enough to hold them together, but I have had much better beans elsewhere and would not get these again.  The portion was skimp too!  It was like 5 spoonfuls worth.  The fries were really thin shoestring fries.  They were pretty good.  My son loved them...he loves pretty much any french fry.  They are his favorite food, by far!  The problem with really thin shoestring fries is that they tend to get hard/cold fast.  They were still pretty good though and I would get them as a side again.  Really big portion of them, too!

My wife gave me a piece of her brisket from her sandwich.  It was legit.  She thought that her brisket sandwich was a little bit too plain/boring though.  The side of mac and cheese was good.  Really cheesy, Velveeta type mac and cheese.  Decent portion size too.  Not sure why the beans were such a skimp portion.  Everything else was hooked up!  Oh yeah..when you are done with your meal they provide you with some free mini donuts.  A bit skimp (3 tiny donuts for 3 people), but free so I can't complain.  They tasted like a lemon pound cake, deep fried and then rolled in sugar.  I could mow down a dozen!  They were delicious!  I just wish they maybe gave you 3 per person...then we would be talking!

Service was great!  They had multiple people servicing our table throughout the whole meal and everyone was on point!  I think even the manager came by to ask how everything was.  Conversation was great, too.  It was the first time Kate and her husband met my wife and son.  A good time was had by all!

Will I be back?  Yes, at some point for sure.  The ribs were absolutely fantastic, and with the right choice of sides, this is a damn fine BBQ meal and a potential 5 star joint!  It wasn't the cheapest lunch ($63.00 after tax/tip), but for my first time here, the amount of food,  and the people I was with, it was worth it!   I'm sure I will be back before too long."}
{"text":"Great place!  Wanted to try something different. How often do you get a chance to eat BBQ!  Very friendly and great staff.  The pulled pork was out of this world.  We tried the combo platter and tried a little bit of everything.  We will be back.  Don't forget to mention YELP for your 10% discount."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for the first time and stopped in for dinner on the way to my hotel. The first thing I tried was the complimentary cornbread and butter- OMG, it was delicious!! I had the beef rib and sausage plate- I wasn't blown away with the sausage, maybe because I'm a Texas girl and have had better but the beef ribs were impressive and so tasty. The meat was tender and flavorful. I shared the Mississippi Mud Pie dessert with my friend and it was fantastic- so chocolatey!! the staff was super friendly as was the manager. I thoroughly enjoyed this place, in fact so much that when I return to Phoenix next week, I will stop in again!  Oh, and the little fresh, warm donuts they give you after your meal with the cinnamon sugar, GET OUTTA HERE, they're divine!!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Best macaroni and cheese I've had outside of Chicago's south side."}
{"text":"Do you want great, smoky brisket, but to order off of laminated menus handed to you by impeccably polite servers? Do you want authentic ribs, but not want to get your hands dirty? Are you curious about BBQ, but aren't sure if it's still conceptually owned by Confederates?  Do you prefer your pork sandwich in a dimly lit museum-lodge instead of at a splintery wooden table outside? Do you wish you were at Hillstone? 

Then Bobby Q is the spot for you! It's giant, civilized, organized, sexy, and capable of hosting massive private parties! It has no trace of the down home, no frill, authentic, dirty, traditional BBQ sentiment I love. Bobby Q combines two culinary traditions (Southern barbecue meets steakhouse vibe) without much organic intersection, providing a nice way for the bourgeoisie to enjoy BBQ, sans flies/plastic cutlery. The food is good, but the hike in price for out-of-place frilliness? Call me a stickler, or a hick, or a hickler, but the glamification of this otherwise humbly glorious cuisine doesn't quite move me."}
{"text":"I saw the sign for this restaurant off the I-17 freeway and later found out that this place catered a dinner for my wife and her colleagues at Grand Canyon University.  I had to try it out.  Since I was meeting a friend from high school who has lived in Phoenix for over 30 years now, I suggested we try this place and he was excited about going.  I know that if a local is excited to go somewhere in their \"backyard\" it must be good.
I ordered the bbq brisket and it was the bomb!!  Very tender and tasty.  Wish I could  have had more than one meal there, but it's something to look forward to on my next trip there."}
{"text":"This place has blown every other BBQ restaurant out of the water, including any family members bbq! I don't know how I will ever go else where. Got there and the wait was over a hour. With the amount of people waiting and from what we've read (and the distance we drove) we were definitely waiting. We didn't have to wait the full time. Our waitress was super knowledgeable about her stuff and got our orders taken and served in no less than 15-17 minutes (quite possibly faster!). The mana her walked around, seemed cool. Stopped to ask us how things were, excellent mister man! And then the complimentary sugar donut-churros sealed the deal and made me a fan for life! Try it out!!"}
{"text":"Got a lb of brisket and lb of pulled pork last weekend .. Everyone loved it. These guys always come thru with good food.  As mentioned in other review I'm picky about my BBQ and these dudes do it right"}
{"text":"(4 stars for my overall smokehouse favorites, 5 stars for PHX up to this point) 
On my continual quest for savory smoked, grilled and BBQ goodness, I decided to stop in. I initially entered the \"Q Lounge\" to check out the Happy Hour which obviously has a huge following and offered a HH buffet and numerous drink specials. While interesting and entertaining, I wasn't feelin' it so after about an hour, I wandered back into the main restaurant. Taking a seat at the bar I ordered up a rather potent and tasty Margarita and looked over the menu. 

Decisions....this looked promising. The wonderful smoke aroma mildly permeating the restaurant gave me further hope that I was getting into something good. Opting for the 2 meat combo with brisket and sausage with roasted corn and mac n cheese on the side, I was looking forward to the meal. 

Served relatively quickly, I stuck my fork into the mac n cheese. I was told it had 5 cheeses. It was quite rich with a very Velveeta like palate and a slight tang of cheddar. The corn was truly roasted, cut off the cob and served up neatly in a bowl. The brisket was tender, smokey and amazing. Well marbled, not too lean and not too fatty. The smoked sausage was not overly smoked, well seasoned and with just enough bite (I will have to try the jalapeno variety next time to compare). 
The serving size was plentiful. And I had enough left over for the next day! 
[Still not Rudy's....my quest continues.]"}
{"text":"One line: Excellent Steak and BBQ Ribs, good portions, MUST GET the Mac N Cheese!

Bobby Qs is one of the best BBQ joints that I've eaten at. 

Reservations: Open Table or you can call in. We were running late b/c of the 101 closure so we called in and they were willing to push our reservation back for us. 

Parking: Two private lots. They even have a guy standing outside to direct you to the second lot if the main lot is getting full. 

Drinks
Ordered the Bobby Q seasonal draft beer and my friend ordered a drink the waiter recommended: some mixed drink that came in a pineapple. Both were good. My friend really enjoyed the novelty of the pineapple. 

Food - Both Entrees 5 Stars
We ordered the two ribs combo and chose St. Louis and Baby Back ribs. The meat on both was fall off the bone tender. I think I prefer the St. Louis ribs though. They seemed to have a little bit more flavor. The spicy and regular BBQ sauce that they served on the side was excellent for dipping the meat in. 

We also ordered a 14 oz. ribeye steak. The aged steak was also really tender.. the kind of melts in your mouth deliciousness. They didn't season it with very much so it is an excellent steak if you enjoy the unadultered taste of meat. The quality of meat here is indisputably excellent. 

Sides:
Mac N Cheese(5*)- MUST GET! The cheese was unbelievably creamy. I'd recommend that everybody choose this for one of their sides... so good that you really don't want to share. 
Shoestring fries (4*)- good crisp fries to dip in the bbq sauce
Roasted corn (3*) - my friend really liked the roasted corn.. i thought it was just roasted corn.
Mashed potatoes (2*)- tasted a little too processed, too smoothed... I think I would have liked a little gravy but at the same time it was too salty and galicy.   


Service: (4-5*) Just the right amount of attention. 
Our server Daniel was really attentive and had some good recommendations, e.g. the drinks and mac n cheese. They were also pretty good about keeping the water glasses full. I guess part of the goal of the restaurant is to have the manager visit each table... which she did. It was very brief but I guess it shows an extra level of service?  I'd also say the service was excellent b/c I forgot my hat and they set it aside for me at the hostess area to be picked up the next day.

Little weird: On the check the pre-calculated/recommended  tip amounts were 18%, 18%, and 20%. I just found it odd that they didn't include the 15% mark and they included 18% twice. 
 
This place is a little pricer... but well worth it if you got the cash. 

P.S. Apparently there is some club/lounge in the actual restaurant. The decor, candle lighting and everything was right... the only detraction was the loud music and bass that could be heard through the wall. It wasn't unbearable but if you're here on a nice date you might want to request to be seated away towards the left side of the dining room."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this restaurant is way too expensive. BBQ is supposed to be cheap and dirty. With this being said the lunch prices are reasonable. The BBQ sampler with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork with one side ran about $14. The ribs were definitely the standout of the meal. They came off the bone clean, were very tender, and had a nice smoky flavor. The pulled pork rivaled the ribs, and may have actually surpassed them in taste. The brisket was tender, but was lacking the flavor of the other two meats. It also seemed a little off in color as it was as it was much lighter than most I have had. Mac n' cheese was my choice of side and it was deliciously cheesy. I could devour bowl after bowl of that goodness. Also worth a mention is the donut they bring you after your meal. That thing, albeit small, was fresh out of the fryer, covered in sugary sweetness and an unexpectedly nice ending to a solid meal."}
{"text":"Great staff, huge portions, excellent prices. Not to mention some of the best bbq and sides I've ever had. A can't miss spot in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"On a visit to Arizona about a week ago I stopped by here for lunch before flying home. This is a nice barbecue restaurant that has an attractive interior along with a bar area. The hostess seated me and it took about 10 minutes before a waiter showed up. The restaurant was about 1/2 full and the waiter said he didn't see me seated. I ordered the smoasted chicken plate with beans, cole slaw and cornbread along with a salad. The salad arrived first and was good. What I didn't like was that the entree arrived just a few minutes later and I hadn't finished my salad and I am not a slow eater. I hurried to finish the salad because I didn't want to food to get cold. 

The chicken was average size and looked just like chicken that I cook on the grill. The cole slaw had pecans on it and was very good (4). I liked the beans too and graded them at a 3.5. The salad was good also and I gave it a 3. I liked the chicken but felt it only deserved a 3. Not bad but I have had many examples that were better. That's why my overall score for the meal is a 3.

Perhaps my tardy waiter and the fact that the timing of the service was off were a fluke. I believe this is a good restaurant and probably is closer to a 3.5 or maybe even a 4. However that was my experience."}
{"text":"Every time I have been to Bobby Qs I have had a great experience. Our server ZAC was awesome, especially for it being his first week! Thanks for great food and great service!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why we haven't been here before but it is fabulous.  Prime rib was done just right and the filet mignon was perfect.  Atmosphere is very fun, and you can make reservations online.  What's not to like!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I thought we would try a new bbq restaurant for our anniversary and was very upset with our choice. We were told the meat was smoked for 14 -18 hours by one waiter and 6 hours by the bar tender which we were a little confused by. We ordered the family meal so we could taste multiple items from the menu......we were not impressed at all. The meat did not have a smoked taste to it at all. It tasted like the meat was boiled and maybe  smoked for an hour. Very disappointing. The bbq sauce takes like a cheap sauce you can got at the grocery store. The mac & cheese tasted like they made it with the kraft cheese that comes in the plastic. Yuck.....The best part of the whole meal was the donuts at the very end. I do not  recommend this restaurant if you are look for some bbq. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since we have had some good bbq. We gave this place a try due to the outstanding Yelp reviews. Let me just say...thank you Yelpers! The restaurant itself is large and has a good amount of parking. The inside is very nice with dark lighting for a nice setting. We were there today about 2 o clock so it wasnt too busy but I can vet this place gets packed! They do have a bar and they had a nice fire oven that you could see chickens being roasted through the glass. 

We tried the Q rolls for an appetizer and they were very good with the chipotle ranch dipping sauce. For an entree my wife tried the pulled pork sandwich and I had the sampler with chicken, brisket and ribs. Both dishes came with a side. We tried the mashed potatoes and gravy and the mac n cheese. Both sides were creamy and delicious! The meats in the main dish were very flavorful and the bbq sauce is good. We really enjoyed the corn bread and the donuts they give you for dessert. 

Sawyer was a great server!"}
{"text":"Successful yelping. It was our first time in Phoenix/Arizona and we were looking for a dinner spot. This place is well-deserving of its 4.5 star rating, all around great experience. 

Shoutout to our server TOMMY, he was awesome and helpful, went extra mile to provide good service. For starters we had the signature Q Rolls...so bomb especially dipped in bbq sauce.  Also tried the two rib combo with the baby back and beef ribs - the baby back ribs were truly fall-off-the-bone, both were good and I'm usually a fan of beefy ribs more.  Also had to try the catfish fillet (breaded & comes with 2 large pieces), which was good too.  I think we liked everything we ate. All entrees/combos come with homemade cornbread and 2 sides each. The CORNBREAD was definitely a highlight of the meal! Some good sides were the potato salad, pecan Cole slaw and roasted corn.  

I guess they always hook you up with complimentary donuts for dessert here too! ALL IN ALL...GLAD WE CAME TO BOBBY Q!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for BBQ or just coming in to have a drink.  I had the half slab ribs with skinny fries and beans. My colleague had the brisket with beans and coleslaw.  Service was friendly and the manager paid us a visit to see how we were enjoying our dinner.  I had their old fashion which wasn't amazing, but suitable.  The beans are great because they add chunks of brisket.  I'm a big fan of skinny fries too and they were good. They gave us some complimentary miniature cinnamon donuts which were addicting."}
{"text":"First time at Bobby Q's today, even though I live less than 10 min away. Killer cornbread. Had lunch platter with pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket. Pork was good. Liked the sauce. Chicken was juicy and tender. I'm Texan and BBQ is in my blood, so re brisket was \"just ok.\" No bark on it and it was a little dry. Roasted veggies were good side for lunch, though I'm sure the Mac n cheese would have tasted fantastic. Will be back."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing. At 830 on Wednesday night they asked us if we had a reservation that's how crowded they get. My husband did have the pulled port platter and the portion did look a little small compared to my baby back ribs. I got the full rack of ribs. It was amazing amazing! Their frozen lemonade is nothing special don't waste your money if anything it is too sweet!! 

Ask for more cornbread and you can get your drink to go."}
{"text":"The best Baby back ribs in town.  Cornbread to die for and strawberry lemonade that makes my mouth water.  Great staff, excellent service, amazing Food.  One of my favorite places to take friends when they are in town.  A Must try for any foodie!"}
{"text":"Chicken quesadilla and the pulled chicken sandwich are good here. While I prefer Pork on a Fork to Bobby Q's, this is a pretty good place to get your BBQ fix."}
{"text":"Updating to add I've now brought more family to this restaurant. I've spent quite a while talking this place up, and thankfully it did not disappoint!
My aunt thoroughly enjoyed her baked potato with pork, my mother enjoyed her brisket sandwich, husband enjoyed his steak, uncle liked his pulled pork, and I was not disappointed by my beef brisket platter. Portions are great and the taste is amazing. 
We had q rolls and queso dip to start. I already knew I loved the q rolls, and while I liked the dip, it wasn't stellar (to me). My husband liked it though. 
My toddler got chicken tenders with fries and seemed to enjoy it, though she liked the bread from the queso dip more. 
I loved the Mac and cheese again, though my mother said it's not as good as her sister-in-law's...which I haven't tried, so I still love this one. 
I also tried the ranch beans. While they were pretty good, they're not my favorite. Some seemed undercooked. My husband thought the same. 

Nobody had room for sweets, so that's my goal next time!"}
{"text":"Why aren't these guys at the Best in the West Nugget Rib Cook-off?? Their ribs are literally, physically, whole heartedly, ballistically, supercalifragilistically fall off the bone tender. The meat was holding on for dear life but didn't have a chance. I ordered a full slab just for myself. Mmmhmm pick up your mouth from off the floor, I sure did. AND....ANDDDDDD, when they give you your bill they bring it with fresh, just fried, pipin hot mini donuts sprinkled w/sugar!! 

If you're in the Phoenix area and want some bangin BBQ, take yo a55 to Bobby-Q. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Best barbecue food I have ever had.  It's more of an upscale barbecue restaurant which is unique. Whenever I am in Phoenix it is a must that I stop in and get there barbecue beef brisket sandwich."}

Service (Waiter / Cleanness / Ambiance)

1/1 Star: very nice waitress. Very clean for a BBQ place. This place looks cool. Feels like a secret shack but its clean and decorated very well. Seats wee comfortable. The manager even came out to say hello and if we needed any thing.

Taste (0=Not Edible / 1=Edible / 2=Good (average) / 3=Must Try!)

3/3 Stars: BEST BBQ I have ever had! Everything was soft, smooth, and melt in your mouth! The brisket is a MUST TRY! And make sure you get a burnt end!!! I've never had a better bite of brisket than that burnt end. Even after I ate the burnt end my mouth was watering for more. The mac & cheese was extremely creamy and delicious. The mash potatoes were also extremely creamy and delicious. It's very rare that I like mash potatoes without gravy but this was amazing! There wasn't even bacon bits on the mash potatoes and it was still delicious! Pulled pork was so soft it almost had the consistency of the mash potatoes. Ribs fell off the bones and were delicious. Fried chicken fillet was very crispy and juicy and was covered is delicious gravy. The only thing that wasn't for me was the BBQ chicken. The Sunday family feast could feed more like 2 normal people. The free mini doughnuts at the end were hot, fresh, and delicious as they fall apart between your fingers as you pick up the super fresh sucker that was fried probably 10 seconds before it got to you. Simply put, food here is amazing and was worth the $40 taxi ride there from the JW Marriott Dessert Ridge and the $40 taxi ride back.

{"text":"So I've never actually eaten  there , but my job took me to the kitchen several times   (delivery, of linens ) ,  the smell of their snooker is amazing !!! I plan ti get there with the Lil woman ASAP  The hostess was very friendly and helpful the 1st time I went there. 4 stars pending actual ingestion  of the great smelling food. They ARE  rated the best BBQ in the US"}
{"text":"I have been passing by this place for years during my visits and never bothered to stop. That was a mistake. Everything was perfect from start to finish. Even the food that I didn't think was perfect was good. I had the ribs and I tried the pulled pork and brisket. PERFECT. The taste was awesome. It was smoked, but not overly so...Tender...DELECTABLE. The beans were good...different...Texas style, but a little sweet. Mac & Cheese was perfect. OH my...The cole slaw was AWESOME! The corn was overcooked to me. It would have been nice to have just a bit of crunch. I wouldn't get the corn anymore, but hell there are so many more sides. The apple pie was oh...so...good. The doughnuts were..to..die..for...And the service...PERFECT!"}
{"text":"we went to bobby q's a couple of weeks ago. they have amazing bbq! we got the  sampler and enjoyed it very much! we happen to sit right in front of their large chicken rotisserie. they smelled amazing! we will try that next time. we can't wait to go back! amazing food!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah I can see why this is a staple in AZ sorry I didn't have any pics my food was to god I devoured it."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Thanks for the recommendation, yelpers!

Austin (our server) gave us great suggestions. We had the baby back ribs, brisket, and Mac and cheese. All awesome!  

Would definitely be back if I ever came through these parts again."}
{"text":"The best BBQ joint I've been too! The BBQ sauce is great and the meat is so tender. The service is great and the location is well kept."}
{"text":"Bobby Q = heaven

I think it's safe to assume that everything on the menu is good because everything I tried here was delicious!!! Even their drinks are yummy. Tried the pineapple surprise, sweet tea and strawberry daiquiri and enjoyed all of them. The cornbread is perfect; especially when you add butter and honey on top. It was so good I ate two of them straight out of the fridge the next morning for breakfast. The side dishes are awesome, especially the mac and cheese and roasted corn. The barbecue is juicy and flavorful. I didn't even add barbecue sauce to my meat because it was just fine without it. You can even finish off your meal with free, yes FREE, donuts. Bobby Q, I love you."}
{"text":"The brisket and Mac and cheese..... YUM! They slow cook the brisket for, I believe, 18 hours and it's so incredibly tender and flavorful. The Mac and cheese also has  quite a few different cheeses... Including velveeta? YES PLEASE.
Personally, I think the cornbread is a little dry and the steak sandwich was just a huge disappointment. I really don't think that one slice of garlic bread and a hunk of steak makes a sandwich. And yes, it's ONE slice of garlic bread... I just don't see that as a sandwich.
The mashed potatoes are great, make sure you get extra gray cause that's the best part.
If you want something as an appetizer, happy hour is from 4-8 and their 50% off... The brisket quesadilla and spinach artichoke queso dip with garlic bread are the best ones on the menu if you ask me.
Give this place a shot, it's got great reviews for a reason. Just don't get the steak sandwich. Hahahah"}
{"text":"Came from Cali to watch the Dodgers but I never thought I would fall in love with the bbq best place I've ate at great service and great food no BS!!!"}
{"text":"I went to a beautiful wedding at Desert Foothills, which was catered by Bobby Q's. Absolutely incredible BBQ. I had the beef brisket, pulled chicken, ribs, smoked sausage and mac and cheese. The ribs and the sliced smoked sausage were AMAZING. So so good. I was in a nice pretty dress, fully planning on eating delicately....one bite, and I was out of control."}
{"text":"My girlfriend from Oregon and I had a delicious meal at Bobby Qs restaurant tonight. Initially, we had a minor situation with the menus each having different prices. The manager was very gracious and offered us the lower-priced menu.  Very professional and very friendly. 
LeeAnne was our server and she was a 10.  ??My girlfriend ordered a steak sandwich. The steak was grilled to perfection with a glazed caramelized sauce that brought out the steak's flavors. It was thick and juicy and so flavorful covered in grilled mushrooms served with onion rings so tasty I ordered one to go.
Their potato soup is almost a meal in itself. It is so flavorful with cheese and bacon and chopped onions and potatoes I could've eaten another bowl instead I got one to go.
Bobby Qs gives you a small bag of homemade donuts to thank you for enjoying their restaurant. Give it a try for sure. 
Second review:  treated friends today to Bobby Qs for burgers and steak sandwiches. Kyle served us and he was beyond on top of keeping us satisfied. Actually I was the one who got treated today.  Manager Taylor himself took care of a minor problem I had with my steak. He solved the issue as fast as humanly possible.  He gave me the BEST customer service ever in any restaurant I've eaten. Food so wonderful; service the same."}
{"text":"OMG the little donuts were melt-in-your-mouth amazing! The baby back ribs were great - meaty and tender. The grilled veggies on the side were smoky and yummy. The service was attentive without being pesty. Even my dirty martini was well done!"}
{"text":"This place is weird because half of it is trying to be a Vegas style night club and stays closed most of the time except weekends. Such a waste of space that could be used to fill tables through out the week instead. My dad really likes this place. The atmosphere is great and most of the food is good but I have had better BBQ. Anyone can grill or \"smoke\" some meat and slather BBQ Sauce on it and trick most people into thinking its great BBQ but the true test is in the brisket and the brisket here is substandard at best."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was amazing! The service was fantastic - friendly and timely. The cornbread to start was delicious, and everyone enjoyed their entrees. I had the juicy southern fried chicken, smothered in a delicious gravy, with roasted corn and mashed potatoes on the side (both sides were exceptional!). I also had a bite of the brisket sandwich - so good! I love the cinnamon donuts as a parting dessert. I'd give this place 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I was out here for work with my coworker working offsite. A couple of facebook friends recommended this place to eat. The bbq here was sooo good we came here twice. I did the 3 meat combo beef ribs, st louis, and brisket with sides of mac and cheese and roasted corn. The sauce on the meat was perfect not too sweet and not too overwhelming, they do give you a jar for added sauce and a option to add their spicy sauce (highly recommend). The meat falls right off the bone and melts in your mouth like ice cream. The mac and cheese was so good it had melty cheesy hearty goodness to it. And the roasted corn was ok, due to im a corn on the cob type of guy. The concept of the restaurant may look deceiving, but once you walk in is like walking into a 4 star restaurant. It gave the presence of comfort with immaculate service. Even the manager that was working both Wednesday and Thursday even recognize us and gave us that welcoming feeling. Definitely a place to come back to when visiting Phoenix. Thank you Bobby Q staff for an awesome service and great food. 5 stars all around."}
{"text":"This place claims to serve Saint Louis barbecue spareribs. I know Saint Louis Saint Louis spareribs are a friend of mine. These were NOT Saint Louis spareribs!"}
{"text":"just wanted mention since on was on the site, NO ONE ever contacted me!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"They had such amazing customer service. The food was amazing! They had bought the mac and cheese and when they placed it on the table it touched a little ketchup. They went a bought a new one out when they didn't need too! They have awesome dessert as well!"}
{"text":"Now here is a place that knows how to make some outstanding barbecue. Have lived near this place for awhile and was always curious how good was it. This place from the time you step in lets you know that this is a true barbecue place. Between the atmosphere which just sets the mark for a very nice place and the smell from when you walk in. Took a friend here, I ordered the barbecue brisket and my mistake was I should of ordered it with sauce just flooding out of the sandwich. My friend ordered the ribs which were so tender that the meat easily came off clean from the bone. I loved how they put sugar on the rims of the glasses for the lemonade. The staff was very friendly and explained that everything is handmade and the meat is cooked for 20 ours before coming out. You haven't had real barbecue until you have come to Bobby Q's."}
{"text":"10/12/14
This used to be a Bobby McGees, which the waitress will probably tell you its your first time there.  The BBQ is some of the best I have ever had in my entire life!  Little speedy, but  not unreasonable & well worth it, if you are taking someone out for a nice dinner, you will be sure to please!   

They have outdoor and indoor seating, and a dance club setting.  It still retains some of its vibe from when it was Bobby McGee's, just modern.   To be honest, this change in format was the best thing that happened to Bobby McGees, because it was starting to feel stuck in the 1970s.  Bobby Q's is just plain awesome.

I highly recommend them!

Update 12/31/17

My review still stands, but be aware that I have noticed since my last review that the crime activity in the surrounding area has become remarkably worse."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Best bbq experience I've  had in the valley. Great meats,  sauces and sides. Gotta try the mac n cheese!  Just when you think you can't possibly stuff another bite in your mouth,  they bring out a bag of fried mini donuts tossed in sugar with your bill."}
{"text":"Hungry for BBQ?  Run, don't walk, to this place!  In from out of town and gave it a shot based on YELP.  Place was a huge hit with the entire family.

Great food...some of the best BBQ we've ever had.  Brisket rolls (Q rolls) as appetizer were fantastic.  We got the family deal for $28 on a Sunday and we had plenty of leftovers.  Cinnamon Sugar donuts (free) for desserts were a hit.  

Service was fast and friendly.  We were seated quickly and all of our food and drinks ordered came to the table fast.  Decor is perfect - rustic but a little  upscale.

Highly recommend doing reservations off their website before going - there was a big wait by the time we walked out on a Sunday.

If we could give 6 stars we would - best restaurant experience we've had in years!!!"}
{"text":"I've had BBQ in California, Texas and Kansas, Booby Q is the best I've ever had . Fall off the bone short ribs with amazing flavor, beef ribs were perfect, even their grilled veggies were the best I've had at a restaurant. Way to go Bobby ! Oh ya, and thanks for  helping me meet my wife in 1992."}
{"text":"The husband and I went here last weekend to celebrate the beginning of my break and to get a juicy burger. The restaurant is cute, kind of themed, and the service was friendly. They smoke their meat for 18 hours and you can see their chicken roasting from the dining room. They start you with some pretty good cornbread. For entrees we split the burger with bacon and bbq sauce and the pulled pork sandwich with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese... very healthy. The burger was tasty, not the most amazing burger ever, but solidly good. The pulled pork was better, definitely flavorful and good with their spicy bbq sauce. Both sides were pretty mediocre, I didn't like the mac and cheese...tasted like velveeta and the mashed potatoes were gluey. When we were done they brought out a little bag with a couple doughnut bites in it.... yum! I would come back here to try some more of their Q."}
{"text":"This place is a Solid B.  As a guy from KC I feel qualified to say they have great BBQ.  Those rolls and brisket are really good.  The place is a pretty nice restaurant and I hate nice BBQ places.  The prices are pretty high and truthfully you could do better for less money."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner and took a seat at the bar. It was my second time there and we had the best service by Shar. She was extremely friendly and attentive. I was very indecisive but after going with Shar's recommendation I got the filet (added mushrooms) and the mashed potatoes and it was BOMB. Wait there is more...she asked if I wanted my mushrooms sliced or whole. What?? Seriously?? I've never been given an option on mushrooms before, pretty awesome. I tried the Bobby's mule--twice lol it was the best mule I've ever had. Overall, I was super impressed and are excited to try out their new biltmore location our server told us about."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here Saturday night.....based on the reviews of Yelp.
We were not disappointed, as a matter of fact, we were pleasantly surprised with every aspect of our evening.  When you arrive at Bobby Q's, the outside makes it feel as if you are about to walk into a dive.  However when you turn the corner and walk in the door, that is not the case.  Very nice ambiance throughout the entire restaurant. They had wonderful mood lighting! I love low mood lighting!  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  Our meals were excellent.  My husband got the Chicken Fried Chicken and I got the Top Sirloin.  We started with the corn bread, which was delicious!  I don't care if it feel apart at least it wasn't dry!  My top sirloin was cooked a perfect Medium and seasoned exceptionally well.  I really loved it and I love steak.  Surprisingly the roasted corn was one of my favorites of the night, I don't usually gobble up corn when I get it with dinner, but man, this was some heavenly corn!  My husbands chicken fried chicken was perfect.  Pounded thin, with a light crispy batter, I hate to say it, but it might have been better than Texaz Grill's chicken!  It was tasty.  My son got the oven cooked pepperoni pizza and it was a large portion for the $4.00 price tag, he even took some home.  Our food was excellent, there wasn't one thing we didn't like, the food was hot, the service was great, the atmosphere was great, we will return!"}
{"text":"Bobby Qs. Bobbbbbbbbby Qs. Where do I start. The service, always great. Manager/owner always stops at your table at least once to see how it's going. They don't even give  a second thought to fix the smallest complaint if one exists. The ribs are number one with the smokehouse burger(no salt) a close second. The shoe string fries love accompanying both(again no salt). The corn bread nicely introduces you, then the Q rolls or pizza with brisket fully loaded helps fill a section of your stomach up, and the entree knocks it out. This place has made it so that every other bbq place sucks lol. Go here order the ribs or burger and tell them to hold the salt. Enjoy"}
{"text":"To be honest, I had never been to or even heard of Bobby Q's - and I have lived about 2 miles away for almost a year now. However, the boyfriend and his family are fans and we decided to go eat here this last weekend for the boyfriend's birthday. This night also happened to be the same night of the \"Phoenix Hurricane\" so we were happy to see the power was on, but boy were they busy!

Something I have always found helpful: \"Never eat at a restaurant that's not busy.\"

We had to wait for almost an hour for a table for 6, but we knew that going in and just waited on the patio. I don't know if they are always that busy, but it seemed the waiting area could definitely have more chairs or space for that term of wait. And if the weather happens to not be so agreeable, like that night, they could use a bit more coverage so patrons aren't getting soaked. 

Anywho - onto the meat - literally. We were sat and started salivating over the menu - all sounded and looked good (I order via Yelp photos). We each ordered something different and there was a lot of sharing going on. One in our party was happy to hear they still offered the Crab Legs dinner, so take note if that's your fancy. We ordered the Rotisserie Chicken meal with (2) sides: mac and cheese and a loaded baked potato. Everything was delicious and satisfying and was plenty of food - I could have probably taken some home - and all for $13. In my opinion, this place has great prices. I expected, with the look and feel of this restaurant, to be a bit over-charged but I was pleasantly surprised. 

Boyfriend ordered the Brisket meal with (2) sides, and dang that meat was tasty! We loved how it came with sauce on it, unlike a lot of these places that are serving you sauceless, dry meat and you have to add it yourself. We also asked for extra and we loved how they brought us our own 'jugs' of regular and spicy (we used up all of the spicy) sauces for the table. 

I cannot remember our server's name, but she was awesome. The definition of what service should be in a busy, family style restaurant. We had a lot of requests for her and she was being asked for this and that left and right by almost every member of our table and she handled each one with patience and grace - I was impressed. And I am rarely impressed by servers lately. 

If it was pouring, and half of the city's power was out, and we had to wait on the patio for an hour for a table - I would still come here and eat again. I am actually looking forward to it. 

OMG those donutsssssssssssss. Make sure you get some. 


That 'nightclub' they have though..."}
{"text":"Over rated and over priced.  I have been in a hole in the wall much better places. The manager came to check the service as a job and not genuinely."}
{"text":"There's no reason you should not go to this restaurant. Their food speaks for itself, my ribs fell off the bone and were absolutely delicious. The lemonade (frozen) blew my mind.
I went for my birthday and had a group of 12, the staff was unaware of this and still put us in a private room and my water cup was never empty."}
{"text":"This place was rated one of the top bbq spots in Phoenix. My partner and I went there when we were visiting Phoenix. It was Friday night and the place was popping. I thought we would have to wait for a table but luckily we didn't. Our server was very nice and knowledgeable. He told us a bit about the place. Food and drink wise...I ordered a watermelon cooler. I thought it would be sweet but it was kind of spicy...in a good way. I had the steak sandwich and my partner had the brisket sandwich. And it was cooked to our liking and the meats were tender. We also got free cornbread which I thought was very nice. The waiter didn't have to give it to us but he did. And my partner and I were both in food comas at the end. I wish they had other locations other than the Phoenix area. But we are definitely going back."}
{"text":"By far the best ribs I've ever had. Split the $52 Whole Hog Heaven platter with my wife. Two rib choices, two smoked meat choices and three sides. It was awesome. Their good rating on Yelp and a hankering for ribs before we boarded a plane back east led us to Bobby Qs and we're thrilled it did."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place since the 70's when it was Bobby McGees never really thought about going to Bobby Qs decided to try it a couple of weeks ago l was very impressed the food was great and the prices were  resonable the manager Taylor was there at the door busy with employees and greeting customers, I was wearing a Navy t-shirt and he asked me if I was a veteran I told him I'm wearing it because my grandson is in the Navy he thanked me and told me to tell my grandson thank you for his service, after enjoying our dinner and receiving our bill I noticed that we were given a 20% military discount, that was a nice surprise and made me feel very proud of my Sailor it was a great evening great dinner. My wife and I went back for dinner again just a few days ago and again was met by Taylor and friendly employees Taylor again was very professional and made us feel very welcome and the waitress was awesome I don't remember her name but she was great. We will be making Bobby Qs a regular dinning spot."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS! My husband's company threw a party here and they sat our massive party on the covered patio which was decorated with hanging lights; the ambiance was enjoyable. We kept them busy ordering different cocktails and appetizers and the servers were informative and upbeat. The spinach dip was a favorite and I remember a tasty shrimp cocktail that I no longer see on their menu. Dinner and desert were phenomenal. I had prime rib and sampled a few different deserts, all delicious. I also decided to have my co-ed baby shower here. I called a month ahead to book a private room, but when I got there they put us in the main dining area. I objected and they ended up moving us to the \"club portion.\" It was cut off from the rest of the restaurant and turned out well. It's a great place to entertain large parties."}
{"text":"So we've run the gamut of dining opportunities here at Bobby Q's - Lunch, Dinner, Take away.  And each and every time, H-E-A-V-E-N on a plate.  Service is prompt but not rushing.  Nice without being pretentious.   Casual and welcoming atmosphere.  And the food - simply yummy.    If you have the kidlins with you, they have plenty of kid friendly foods.  It's a great place and we've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best brisket ever! Tender, moist and juicy -- not fatty. Excellent pulled pork, tasty sides. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim. The outside is very deceptive but the inside is pretty nice, great atmosphere and mood lighting. The food though is the key here. In one word, spectacular! I got the brisket sandwich with Mac & cheese. So so so good!  The brisket falls apart it's so tender, and really doesn't need a sauce. The Mac & cheese is gooey, creamy & hot. The husband had the BBQ chicken and he inhaled his. Just a great meal."}
{"text":"Very Yummy BBQ here. You can smell it from the parking lot. It is in the middle of the neighborhood, but don't doubt it! You get mini donuts at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"Barbecue is the best. Everything here is good. Mac and cheese here is my favorite! Love the corn bread too..."}
{"text":"This isn't your typical bbq place, where you wear bibs and there's country music playing and bbq sauce flying everywhere - that's how we do it in Texas. At Bobby Q's, its more formal; there's a nice ambience, there's a full bar, and you eat with forks and knives. 

The Pros:
The great service
The 10% off by checking in on yelp - yay!
The complimentary cinnimon sugar donuts at the end which are HOME MADE - dayum, those things were awesome
The pineapple drink - its a real pineapple filled with a ton of alcohol but guess what? It tastes like juice...which means its dangerous. Drink at your caution.

Cons
Their sides could be better - The mac and cheese was way too thick and unfortunately, didn't match the rave reviews. 

Another interesting fact - there's a club next door so you can get your grub and then dance it off"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The platters can feed two, their house salad (usually basic) had bacon and cheese on it, the patio was awesome, and free donuts Togo!"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hoopla is about this place.  I'm pretty particular about my BBQ having grown up in Dallas; so I'm partial to NE Texas BBQ, and this ain't it.  I suppose it appeals to a broad spectrum of diners which is what it takes to fill a restaurant.  Recent visit had the brisket, chicken and links.  Brisket was ok, chicken-ok, link not very good.  The mac and cheese was stellar, rest of the sides were mediocre.  The doughnuts at the end of the meal is a very nice touch.  A little pricey for a BBQ joint."}
{"text":"I noticed that the owner/manager of Bobby Q is frequently on this yelp page, so I really hope he gets to this review because I had a fantastic dinner at Bobby Q's Sunday night. The food, ambience, and everything was great, but what really set this place over the top for me was our server, Anthony.

So if the staff over at Bobby Q's ever reads this, I just want to let them know how impressed I was with Anthony's service(enough to toss him a $10 tip on a $20 check, it'd be more but a starving student can only give so much haha). He was not only attentive and helpful but was very friendly throughout the night. Coming by at the most opportune times to offer us water refills, extra sauce(warmed sauce, fancy!), and even suggested different items on the menu that he thought we'd like better(which we did!) Such a great guy and really made a huge difference in our dining experience.  So if you ever get the chance to stop by Bobby Q's, ask for Anthony and toss him a huge tip as a thank you after you have one of the greatest dining experiences of your life!  Haha.

All that aside, the food at Bobby Q's was great as well. We got the three meat combo with Beef Ribs(great), Baby back ribs(my personal favorite), and beef brisket(a tad bit dry, but still good) with Mac and cheese(amazing!) and shoestring fries(also good) as the sides. Everything was great, and the fact that we didn't have to wait an hour like at other BBQ places was another huge plus as well. The food came quick, was piping hot, and they even split it onto two plates for us because I was splitting the food.

At the end of the dinner, they gave us some cinnamon donuts to-go with our meal, which was the real cherry on top of everything. Loved this place, will definitely be bringing friends here for BBQ nights, and I could go on for days about the great service from Anthony."}
{"text":"I was visiting my friend in Arizona this past May, and we were looking to get some barbecue. She had never been here, so we decided to check it out for lunch. We both ordered the platter sampler ($16) that came with a variety of items. I got the brisket, ribs, and pork with a side of fries while my friend got the sausage instead of the pork. The sausage was a little spicy and a tad on the drier side (still good though), but everything else was excellent. The ribs were especially good - the meat was tender and fell off the bone easily. At the end of your meal they give you free mini donuts which was cute.
Interior is nice and spacious, there is outdoor seating, and service was great. According to my friend it was a little pricier, but I'm used to LA/NY prices, so I thought it was a deal considering I still had leftovers after eating my fill. If I were ever in the area again, I would definitely go."}
{"text":"The Corn Bread was the BOMB and the the RIBs were even better.
I'm a fan of Tony Roma's RIBs and there is not one here (yet?) in Phoenix, so I tried this place and will be back again. The mashed potatoes were ok. and so was the Mac N Cheese as my 3 year old tore that up. My 8 year old tore up the RIBs and bone almost, lol.
I wouldn't recommend Sunday's though as it was PACKED and took longer than anticipated. So if you're hungry and it's not Sunday, I recommend this place.
The area is NOT my favorite place to be as I used to live literally on the same block (neighborhood) and it's kind of ghetto (IMHO).
Lost 1 star for the Sunday wait and location."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Phoenix.  Jessica our waitress was friendly and very helpful.  A clutch go to dinner where service and food is amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place! Unpretentious. Good food and great service. The home made donuts are addicting. They give you a lot of food so make sure you leave room for the donuts.

T would take the donuts on the golf course!"}
{"text":"Had a fun night I was turnt 
Went on a Thursday.
Bad thing was right before 
Closing time someone started
 a fight huge fight and most of us where told to leave. Which was fine cause I didn't wanna get shoot!


Wants to update my review to say sorry for my complaint. This is the same location but at night they turn this place into a nightclub this is where the altercation happened."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here for the first time. It was excellent! 
It was an hour drive for me but worth every minute.
Service was fast & friendly. Chelsea took excellent care of this first timer. I ordered the two rib combo with baby back & St.Louis. My sides were beans and pecan Cole slaw. Everything was hot and fresh. The meaty ribs did fall off the bone. I was licking my fingers after the couple of bites. I like it when a manager stops at your table to make sure everything is ok, nice touch. A little spendy but you get what you pay for and in my case it was actually 2 meals. I feel sorry for the other bbq places in the valley that I thought were good...Bobby Q kills 'em."}
{"text":"This place has some great BBQ, there's no other way to put it. The serving size they give you per plate are huge, you'll more then likly be taking some of your meal home with you to enjoy later. The brisket is what i would suggest, its amazing."}
{"text":"The food was decent, though I've had better barbeque (their sign says something like \"Best barbeque in the U.S.\"
The one dish that stood out was their grilled corn.  It's cut off the cobb and had a sweet flavor.
We noticed that about 1 in 3 patrons were grossly overweight, perhaps their servings are  more than one person should eat (we split the 3 meat dinner)."}
{"text":"Let's start with the waitress. Could she be more enthusiastic? Probably not. She was great. Described the food like she was ordering for herself. Then the cornbread. Wow. Best ever. Period. Everybody ordered something different so i won't include all the details, just the highlights. Mac n' cheese. EASILY the best I have ever eaten. Let's talk ribs. My daughter will not touch BBQ sauce. She helped me gobble my ribs down with great enthusiasm. Fall off the bone might be an understatement. Service was great and surprisingly, the price was more than fair. If you are a BBQ fan, this is a MUST TRY."}
{"text":"Definitely order the Q- Rolls as an appetizer. They made me think of a barbecue egg roll. So good! Right as we finished off those, the waiter dropped off 2 sweet, warm, delicious cornbread cakes. The fried chicken was good, but not great. The roasted corn and mashed potatoes were very good. Potatoes came without gravy and I would probably ask for some next visit. My husband enjoyed his steak. It was cooked perfectly and tender. The coleslaw was was good, as was his very cheesy Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I'm officially changing my name to chimchurri shrimp!
The best shrimp I've ever ever had.   Holy shr#mp!

Wait staff was great- and manager Michelle was very nice and welcoming.  If you're a foodie- this is your church!"}
{"text":"Best steak & lobster in Phoenix. Our go to restaurant! Service is A+, great atmosphere prefect for a night out."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with this spot the ribs were outstanding the coleslaw was perfect and the Mac and Cheese was incredible. I cannot wait to go back and try more food there. Austin our server was great he checked on us all throughout the evening. If you have a chance to try this place don't cheat yourself treat yourself to some good eatin'!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is da bomb, although priceyl!  For two people, plan on spending close to a bill ($100).  My bf and I split a rib combo plate.  The food was simply divine.  I also ordered a drink which came in a pineapple."}
{"text":"Let me just say that I am not a BBQ kind of girl. My husband is a BBQ fiend so I tend to make some concessions for him. Bobby Q's was one of those concessions. Thank goodness for that because I love this place. Luckily for me, there are things here I would eat such as the grilled salmon ($17) and chimichurri shrimp ($16). And the sides, good heavens, the sides are so damn good. The only ones I ever get are the sweet, buttery corn and the mac and cheese. Neither are healthy (the corn is extremely buttery) and the mac and cheese is extremely gooey...just the way it should be! I am a sucker for a good mac and cheese and then when you factor in the best corn bread I have EVER eaten, I am a goner. Good lord, you would think I am hungry the way I am writing this review but I promise I am writing this on a full stomach. No, but seriously, if you like corn bread, you have to try Bobby Q's corn bread. It's ridiculous. Then at the end of the meal, they give you these sugary donuts (the granulated sugar) that just top off a great meal. If you go on Sundays, try the Hog Heaven. For $29, you can feed 3-4 people. It has pulled pork, beef brisket, baby-backed ribs, bbq chicken, two sides, and corn bread. I do think the sides are not enough for four people compared to the amount of meat you get. We ordered it last night and had enough meat for 5 people but enough sides for only 2 people. They did give us 6 pieces of corn bread, though. Either way, it is a GREAT deal. 

The interior is very nice with dim lighting for a possibly romantic feel. It seems kid-friendly and we haven't had any issues bringing our almost 3 year old here. We have also always had good service. The prices are on the higher end but as I mentioned the Hog Heaven on Sundays is a very reasonable deal when eating out. Hmmm, I think another visit this week is in order...."}
{"text":"Yelp did NOT lead us wrong.  
My husband and I live about 200 miles north of Phx., so when we come down we like to go for a nice meal.  We like to try new places, but the last three or four have been bad.  This time I went to Yelp to find a few possibilties.  We decided BBQ was the flavor of the day.  Bobby Q;s was the second listing by ratings,but they had an impressive number of reveiws, and they were close to our stops for the day.
Okay, on to the meal...It was fantastic!  The lunch menu is fairly priced for what you get.  I went for the most expensive thing( $13.00), a 3 meat sampler plate.  I ate way too much, but it was so good.  The hubby got the smokehouse burger,  he loved it, talked half the way home about how good it was.  He grew up near Memphis, where BBQ is a staple and he loved the BBQ sauce.  The cornbread cakes were a great starter, and the doughnuts they gave us for a finisher were all the dessert we had room for.  
Last but not at all least, Jo did a wonderful job of taking care of us and answering any questions that we had.  
We will be back, probably next trip to Phx."}
{"text":"Good food good company and great server. Cameron was so cute and had was very patient with all my #none of this\" and  \"dressing on the side\" demands. I will return"}
{"text":"Bobby Q's is an excellent place for family dinner. Workers are very friendly from the start and makes you feel very comfortable. Corn bread is delicious! By far the best barbecue I've had so far in Arizona. To top it off they give you free old fashioned donuts as treats to take home. Add in reasonable prices and you've got a pretty great place. I highly recommend their Q rolls!"}
{"text":"Their Prime Rib is terrific! Service was great and Manager always comes over and asks how everything was! Love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Corn bread was really good and the mac and cheese was so creamy. Had the pulled pork sandwich and really enjoyed it. My husband has baby back ribs and they were fall off the bone good. The atmosphere is really cool.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent ribeye , ribs and brisket . Potato salad was very good , coleslaw not so much . Grilled veggies to die for . Service is second to none Ashlynn was awesome , very helpful ."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews normally because it is just my opinion and everyone has one, right? Well, looks like things do change.  My husband and I went to Bobby Qs today on the advice of a friend.  I love BBQ, my husband not so much.  But....he gave it 5 stars and I'm all in.  

We ordered the Whole Hog meal to share.  I ordered a house salad to share as well.  Garrett, our server, was PHENOMENAL! watching and close by but not hovering and in your face.  He gave a great history of the place, was prompt, polite, funny.  Garrett even split the salad into 2 bowls for us, without my asking.  

Honestly when the meal came, we thought Oh thats not alot...well, we brought home a packed box of leftovers.  Beef ribs were tender, juicy and sauced perfectly.  Baby backs were even better and the pulled pork was mind numbing.  Even the sides were delicious..good compliments to the meal not an after thought and plenty for 2 people.   Bbq ordered out is so hit and miss...BobbyQs was nothing but homeruns!! 

This is definitely a place we will return to again and again...not only was the staff great, the food fantastic, the prices right....these people understand good Southern Sweet Tea. That tops it for me."}
{"text":"They would get 5 stars if the female staff were more attentive to EVERYONE at the table and not just my husband, Forgot my drinks multiple times but were constantly refilling his. Then she just kept trying to engage him in a conversation and actually started flirting with him ( playing with her hair and PUT HER HAND ON HIS) We left immediately and i was EXTREMELY upset."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the valley! The brisket is my absolute favorite and its so tender. The ribs are really good as well. The price of the meat platter dinner (not sure of the name) came with so much food. Im sure it could feed a good 5 people."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, service is decent. There isn't much better BBQ in the area, a little pricey but the environment it's fun."}
{"text":"Amazing food and bbq. Service was awesome and the price was good for the food. Beef ribs are the best big and full of beef. St. Louis ribs come right of the bone without a problem."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in this town !! the babyback ribs fall of the bone! steaks are freaking great because they use walnut and mesquite to cook the meat with, The Ribs & Brisket are smoked for nearly 20 hours. I have yet to have a bad meal at any of the locations. They Have veggie burgers at the 32nd St location ! The servers and staff just treat me special"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is perfect. Eating here is really an experience. I've ordered the whole hog on several occasions, which includes a variety of meats and feeds about 3. Be sure to ask for extra bbq sauce, as multiple types are available. Also donuts at the end are a nice touch."}
{"text":"Food amazing, service wasn't the best for us.. Maybe a new waitress.. Drinks were empty and we sat waiting for things and our check for more than an appropriate time. But we all loved the food and will go back. Expect a long wait if you go during the weekends!! We waited a hour on a Friday night and had gotten there at 6:45.

They have a club inside that requires fancy dressing of you want to go. Sounds fun. I was with my family so that wasn't in the plans. 

The area is a little creepy but again the food was SO good!! The inside reminded me a bit of a Papadeauxs style. Check them out, you won't be disappointed in their yummy food."}
{"text":"Caveat Emptor--- If you like REAL BBQ this is not the place for you.  The first clue was that the place slathers it's food in sauce as a rule, not an option.  I have no idea how they can smoke their meats for up to 22 hours without having any noticeable hint of smoke.  And don't tell me that, \"it has a smoke ring so it has to be good\"(that's just a natural reaction of nitric oxide).  The brisket was bland, the beef ribs had essentially no meat, the pork ribs had a little flavor, and the pulled pork was downright appalling and stringy and flavorless.  

Sides of grilled vegetables were flavorless and bitter.  The pecan coleslaw was bland, and the pecan part was just a sprinkle of untoasted pecans sprinkled on top, and the ranch beans were very vinegary (a welcome bit of flavor)

I have no idea how this place was voted a best BBQ place in the nation unless it was by a bunch of people that have no tastebuds, in fact, I would rank this as some of the worst I've had in the nation.  

This place needs to up their game, Phoenix has BBQ that is infinitely better and at half the price.  

The service was fine, but the management is a bit overbearing.  When you need to toot your horn about how good you are to every table when they sit, it really shows that you're not that great, greatness speaks for itself.

Bottom line, my family will not return, and will never recommend that anyone else does.

Please search out any small local BBQ pit and get some real food with real flavor."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Phoenix! Everything we ate was amazing! We will be back whenever possible!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazeballs! I've been to some of the best BBQ joints in the country (Bogart's, Pappy's in St. Louis and Kreuz, Smitty's, Black's in Texas) and this is not far behind at all! Plus, the service couldn't be much better. 

Ambience was great and a tad dark with a bit of a rustic feel to it. Too bad it was cold outside that night or we would have eaten out on the patio. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of potato salad. Before that came, we started with a complimentary corn bread which was one of the best corn breads I've ever had. It was warm, sweet, and almost cake-like in texture. Pork from the sandwich was moist and not stringy at all (which is often the case in a lot of BBQ places). The flavor itself was smoky and there was just enough sauce so that the taste of the meat still took center stage. Potato salad was great too and had just the right amount of mayo. 

Once we had finished our meal, we were given a bag of complimentary mini donuts to take home. Wow, free cornbread AND donuts? I'm completely sold! I've tried a good amount of restaurants since moving to Arizona about 2 months ago, and Bobby Q is definitely in my top 3."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have ever had.  Great food, great service, and they even hand you a bag of freshly made donuts for a to-go treat.  This is what eating out should be."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday and got a family type platter. It's good, reasonably priced, and 3 people can comfortably eat from it."}
{"text":"If you want some tasty BBQ and a fun atmosphere this is the place for you! Highly recommend making reservations as this place was crazy on a Thursday night. We were seated right away and our server explained all their specials and drinks to us. She got our drinks started right away but there were so many people here this night that our appetizer came before our drinks. This was not a problem though, as our family was just enjoying hanging out together. 

All of the meat was so delicious. Smokey, moist, and flavorful! Also that mac and cheese was delicious! Portions are huge so expect to take half your food home, we love left overs so this was not a problem for us. I will say after our entrees came out our server seemed to disappear and it was difficult to order dessert and get our check. 

All in all this was a great place for some good BBQ, definitely come ravenous!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Texas, so I have been searching for good barbeque in Arizona since I got here a couple years ago.  This place is the real deal, and SO much better than the crappy chains like Dickey's.

I came in for lunch last week and got a cup of the ham and bean soup to start with.  It was yummy!  Delicious broth, plenty of thinly sliced ham.  I also ordered the sampler lunch of baby back ribs, barbeque chicken, and spicy sausage, with a baked potato as the side.  The ribs were heavenly, I didn't even bother to pick them up because the meat just fell right off the bone so I used a fork.  Perfect with zero gristle.  The sausage was pretty good, a little dry but nothing to frown about.  The chicken was okay, but barbeque chicken isn't really my thing, I only ordered it for variety because I didn't want three pork dishes.  The corn bread that comes on the side is pretty good, it's very light, somewhat sweet and falls apart as you pick it up.  The baked potato was alright.

Coming for lunch here is definitely the better deal,  the three meat sampler was maybe $12 (sorry I can't remember for sure) and came with one side plus cornbread.  The three meat sampler at dinner is $21 with the same amount of food except you get an extra side.  Pretty criminal if you ask me.  So even though the bartenders at dinner are really lovely, I'd rather come in for lunch and pay half the price for the same amount of food.

As a bonus they also give you a paper bag of fresh mini cinnamon-sugar donuts with the check, although good luck finding room for them!"}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service. Best Barbecue in town. Love the donuts too. Abby was a great server. Will definitely eat returning to this place.  For me it is pricey but it is worth every penny.  Very filling"}
{"text":"Pricey but worth every penny. I had a carzy pineapple dink that made the whole night perfect."}
{"text":"Went for another visit and am raising my prior rating due to more ample servings this go around. Also, the Yelp check-in discount was good to have too!"}
{"text":"After seeing that over 130 people had already reviewed this place I almost decided to not post but I felt like with the quality of food and service that we received it would be unfair to not do my part to pump this place up.  

We showed up for lunch and were greeted immediately upon entering.  We sat outside on the patio and there were a few comments from my fellow diners about how comfortable and well decorated the place was. 

The service was great.  Very attentive and efficient.  She was right on with the drink refills and did everything with a smile.

My brother had the pulled pork sandwich and managed to finish it, but just barely.  His girlfriend did the same.  I decided to try the sample platter consisting of sausage, ribs, and chicken.  I was not sorry.  The sausage was very tasty but wasn't overpowering.  The chicken was done with plenty of flavor and not at all dry.  The ribs were great as well.

I couldn't finish the plate so I get to enjoy the leftovers tonight.   There's nothing better than enjoying a meal, then being able to enjoy it again!

Don't forget to mention yelp to get your 10% off.  And enjoy your thank-Q's when you leave."}
{"text":"Hands down, some of the best slap your mama bbq I have ever had. Simply amazing. The server was awesome, energetic, and fun to boot. I will make it back..."}
{"text":"I'm baaaackkkk! And all is still great. Service and food.
The service really shined on this visit. The food just speaks for itself. Just go. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"There donuts and corn bread is to die for ! I will just drive sometimes for this items ... 
there baby back ribs are super juicy and well flavored . I have also experience there night fusion and Ambience and can tell you there drinks are also full of all the good stuff. The martini taste like martini . The beers are nice and cold !!! Great place ..."}
{"text":"This was one of the best lunches I've ever had. My colleague and I stopped off to enjoy lunch after our meeting. We ordered the smoked brisket in a roll for the appetizer which was absolutely amazing. I had the brisket for lunch. I thought it was really good as well.  But over done as it was falling apart when you touched it. The baked beans were off the chain! Def recommend going here. You'd love it! Try the Bobby Q pale ale. Perfect!"}
{"text":"First of all, kudos to Bobby Q's staff. Absolutely EVERYONE was super friendly and attentive. I was waited on in some way by at least 5 different members of their team, at least 1 of whom I believe was the manager. Everyone smiled and made eye contact, and they all seemed genuinely concerned that my needs were being met, and that I was getting what I wanted. I was immediately greeted with a smile when I walked in, and smiled at the entire time I was there. I really did experience 5 star service.

The ambiance was casual, rustic, and interesting in its own way. 

The bartender came right over (you guessed it - with a big smile) and when I indicated that I had not been in before, she immediately explained about the lunch menu and the various options in just enough detail. She left me to fill my drink order while I considered my choices. 

I decided on the Platter Sampler, which allowed me to choose three kinds of meat, a side and cornbread. I figured that this would give me a chance to check out more than 1 item. Of the sides, the roasted corn was the most appealing to my tastes. I also ordered their shoestring fries. I don't have the capacity to consume large amounts of food, but with that long a drive, I wanted to try lots of things, even if I couldn't finish them.

A few minutes later, I overheard a couple of gentlemen at the end of the bar ordering meatloaf. Wondering how I had overlooked that, I studied the menu some more, but didn't see meatloaf anywhere. When I asked, the bartender indicated that they periodically have off menu specials. Since I had come so far, I ordered the meatloaf (only $9.99) to go.

My food came out very quickly, and there was a lot of it. Portion sizes were generous. I had opted for a combination of Brisket, St. Louis Ribs, and Spicy Smoked Link Sausage. 

The roasted corn was not corn on the cob, although the dish was topped off with two slices from the end of a roasted ear of corn. The off the cob corn had kernels that looked like they had seen fire. The juice that the corn was in had a good solid smokey flavor to it. I had anticipated and would have preferred roasted corn on the cob. To my personal tastes, it wasn't great, but it also wasn't bad.

The shoestring fries were perfectly cooked, thinly cut, skin on, and nicely salted. It was a HUGE order that came out in a little pail. I could have made a whole lunch out of the fries alone! I hardly put a dent in them.

Turning to my platter of meat, I was somewhat disappointed overall. 

There were several slices of brisket. It was extremely moist, almost mushy as if it had been cooked in liquid, and there was no smoke ring. I've lived and eaten all over the country, including Texas and the Carolinas. I have had good smoked brisket, and this bore no resemblance. It was more like pot roast or meat you would find in stew, with no smokey flavor. In fact, the corn had more smokey flavor than my brisket. I would not order the brisket again because I think this must just be the way they have decided to prepare it. Maybe lots of people love it. Maybe they've never had better. I didn't like it.

The sliced link sausage was missing the usual coarse texture of sausage, with the textures of fat and lean. The mouth feel was as if it has been boiled, or in liquid at a sufficient heat to cook the fat out of it. That left the texture sort of like moist cardboard. The flavor coming through wasn't bad, but the effect was like nicely seasoned boiled cardboard. (It took me the entire drive home to figure out a truthful way to describe it.) Perhaps this batch had just been sitting in warm moisture too long. I'm going to go back and read through the reviews again to see if I'm the only one who experienced this.

The St. Louis Ribs saved the day for the meats. Except for being a bit fatty, and a general lack of smokey flavor, they weren't bad. Not great, but not bad.

The good news was my take-out meatloaf special. I swear my portion of meatloaf was nearly 2 pounds! It was also tasty! It wasn't what I expected as it had more pungently savory ingredients than I am accustomed to in meatloaf, including a degree of heat, although not excessive. It was topped with a generous portion of golden fried onions, and accompanied by a huge serving of skin on mashed red potatoes! The only downside for me was the gravy, which I am grateful came in a separate container on the side. I'm not a fan of tarragon or thyme or whatever it was loaded with. Lots of people at the bar were eating it, but I didn't notice whether or not they used/ate the gravy. Simply a matter of preference I guess.

Please consider this review with a grain of salt. I've traveled and eaten extensively, but I'm not a critic. I just know what I like. You may love what Bobby Q's has to offer. The only thing that I am really sold on is the wonderful customer service. I'll also throw in that they appear to have lots of regulars, and that lunch appeared to be a bustling affair with no lack of diners."}
{"text":"The St. Louis style ribs here were on point. Very tender, very smoky, very much reminded me of the ribs I had at Pappy's Smokehouse in St. Louis, MO. The one knock on it was that it was a tad too salty, but I'm not one to complain about a little salt. They were so good we impulsively ordering a SECOND rack of ribs, only to realize that we were too full to continue soon thereafter.

The Q-Rolls stuffed were amazing as well, especially with the chipotle dip. Imagine a buttery pastry wrapped around smoked brisket, and you get the Q-Roll. If you had to get one appetizer, get this.

The best part is that they give you free donut holes at the end of your meal!"}
{"text":"This quite popular BBQ joint in North Phoenix is easy to miss off the freeway, but once you arrive you wondered how you could have ever missed it!  

This restaurant has a simple menu, fair prices, wonderful Happy Hour specials and FREE Cinnamon Sugar Donuts for all!!  (Get an extra bag to go!)

You can't go wrong with anything you order here.  All meats, chicken and fish too, are moist, tender, seasoned very well and are very filling.  My favorite side dishes there are the macaroni and cheese (da bomb!), Pecan Coleslaw (yes...Pecan!) and their shoestring French fries, with BBQ Sauce as a dip!  

That's all well and good, but what keeps me coming back is their BRISKET!!  Hot damn!  Lean, tender, juicy and addictive!!  You'll be dreaming of Bobby Q Brisket in your dreams that night!  Their Brisket, Ribs and PRIME RIB (ahhh) are the top three sellers at Bobby Q! 

They have a WONDERFUL lunch menu, but what I like is that they don't skimp on serving size for lunches.  You get a ton of meat and normal size side dish.  You just pay a few dollars less.  That's always good. 

Don't forget the FREE Cinnamon Sugar Donuts at the end of your meal.  Grab an extra bag of them as you leave.  I've also seen people grab a bag of them as they go in as well!  No one there will tell you that you will spoil your meal by doing that so have at it!"}
{"text":"This was an interesting find. Upon arriving in Phoenix, i obv checked yelp to see what the best eats were. Based on the reviews, this seemed like a no brainer. 

Its basically an off the highway stop for grub. The outdoor eating area looked more appealing than inside. The service was great but i just wasnt crazy about the bbq or drinks unfortunately. We shared the Q rolls and a both ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The Q rolls tasted like they were from Applebees and the pulled pork just wasnt juicy at all.  The mac n cheese was actually pretty good. Portions are pretty large also. 

The drinks were 95% mixer. They give you unlimited cornbread which was different than your average. It was a circle of  soft and buttery goodness. They also give you free donuts at the end of your meal. These were the winner for me. THEY WERE SO GOOOOD! 

However, the service was great! Our waiter was very attentive and offered if we wanted more cornbread and whatever else we needed. 

I unfortunately would not return here again. It just seems like people like it cause its a convenient \"real food\" stop on the highway. Its definitely not the best bbq iv ever had and it is certainty not worth the hype. If i do return,  itll be for those damn donuts!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to BBQ place in Phoenix!! The BBQ is amazing, the decor is inviting, and the service is great! We come here as often as we can!"}
{"text":"Great food, actually i think it is the best BBQ in town. Will always go there if there was any special occasion. But be prepared that it is always a super busy, at least every time we had been there."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix visting from California, so we decided to check out Bobby Q restaurant since it was near our hotel (marriott). I was impressed by surprise.  I wasn't a big fan of the cornbread and my margarita but overall the food was good. Their Amble ale beer was good as well. Will return on my next visit"}
{"text":"I've been to Bobby Q's three times now. I don't get how they are Yelp top 100. It is ok but not fantastic. 

My roasted corn last night was clearly previously frozen corn that had been heated up.

They forgot my sweet potato fries and had to be reminded three times to bring them out. 

The chicken and brisket were fantastic. 

BBQ sauce was ok.

Decor and atmosphere were cool! 

Nothing special or super cool on the cocktail list. 

Definitely make a reservation on the weekends. They are crazy busy and the wait is long if you just walk in. 

Honestly, just about any BBQ place in Texas is comparable or better than Bobby Q's. If you want BBQ it is good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Best brisket in town.  Garrett our waiter was one of the best waiters I have ever had.  He was very attentive and friendly.  The food came out quickly and was delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out on a business trip: fire roasted rotisserie chicken w/ mac&cheese and a wedge salad

Chicken was falling off the bone delicious. I'm a health nut, and although I know bleu cheese dressing is \"better\" for you, this stuff tastes so incredible you would never know.

Not the low-key hole-in-the wall kind of place, but still seemed fun for a chain-like dining experience. I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"I've been a lot of places to eat and this place by far is now tied for 1st place on my places to eat! The atmosphere is great, the service is awesome, and the food is absolutely wonderful. I recommend this place to everyone. I hope they gets on the uber eats app so I can enjoy them more often!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Come try it. Loving the brisket and there potato salad is to die for."}
{"text":"Make a reservation this place gets packed. Great food and drinks!!! The dessert donuts are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a million times and it just keeps getting better. The place will amaze you. I am a huge fan of the decor and ambiance. The service is excellent. Our server was Kody, super cute and nice young guy! He was on point with his recommendations. The food is fabulous. Bobby Q is a must for all you carnivores before you die. They are known for their Baby Back Ribs and St. Louis Ribs but everything else like the rotisserie chicken is very savory. Lastly, their signature donuts are the best! Omg I love those donuts"}
{"text":"Solid food choices, great happy hour beer prices, and lots of room for large groups, Bobby Q's is one great place.  I had the 3 meat combo with baby backs, beef ribs, and brisket.  Ribs were tender and moist, and the brisket was fall-apart good.  My only complaint would be the sweetness of the BBQ sauce, but then they provide you with a spicy option at your table when the food comes out, so problem solved!

Bonus, when you check in on Yelp you get a 10% discount off your bill.  And props to our server Emmy, who did a great job dealing with 6 wise-ass baseball fans and kept our whole meal running smoothly.  I will DEFINITELY be back to Bobby Q's on future visits and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Just as delicious as it was five years ago! Jessica was our waitress and took excellent care of us! We split the hog heaven and almost finished it. The brisket melts in your mouth! And the doughnuts...no matter how full I am they are a sweet finale!!"}
{"text":"When you hear about barbecue, you have to mention Texas and Kansas City. Well, this dude lived in Texas and Kansas City and tasted incredible BBQ in old Texas and ''legendary burnt ends'' at Joe's/Q39 in Kansas City. Probably nobody has told you that Bobby Q in Phoenix delivers kick-ass to-die-for morsels of world-class brisket! 

I came to Phoenix getting ready to enjoy a conference, catch up with good amigos, eat good Mexican food and of course, In-N-Out burgers!! The latter two didn't happen. However Bobby Q happened. It was the best food I have eaten in a while. The wonderful knowledgeable friend Mark H invited me here. This place is about 25 minutes driving north from Downtown Phoenix. Atmosphere is lovely with available patio seats. The staff were the most pleasant and friendliest! For me, if you want to test a BBQ place, get the brisket and see. They served sweet corn bread which was scrumptious! I'm glad my shyness stopped me from devouring Mark's bread. When that naughty brisket came, initial impression was OK.. There was no charred marks or anything. But once you bite the first morsel, you're transferred immediately to another world...It was the most tender, juiciest, tastiest brisket I have ever had so far. I will stop here. 

Next time in Phoenix, try brisket at Bobby Q you must! I can't thank the awesome Mark H enough for this. To Bobby Q chefs, owner, staff, thank you so much! Keep up the smile; keep up the solid work!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  I had a pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw. Not too much sauce but they give you some on the side of you want more. Spicy and regular. Fun decor and good music. We'll come back for sure and sit and the bar. Several good beers on tap. Tommy our server was great, he took really good care of us."}
{"text":"Yay..my first review!

Bobby Q will not disappoint you. This place has a spacious parking lot and street parking which makes coming here pretty convenient. The hostess was pleasant and our waiter was very patient with us.

I highly recommend the St Louis style ribs. All the ribs are cooked for 10+ hours so they fall right off the bone and melt in your mouth. If you're looking for something much bigger for 2+ people to share and want to try a variety of items, Whole Hog Heaven is for you! Keep in mind the name, because that's exactly what you're getting. It's a heavenly plate of four types of meat along with three sides. We got mac n cheese (good but not great), shoe string fries (yum!), and roasted corn (ok).  *sigh*..I'm still stuffed thinking about it. 

Oh, don't forget to mention Yelp and get 10% off!"}
{"text":"Some great barbecue here. We had the pulled pork and brisket sandwiches and both were pretty much perfect. The mac and cheese is straight up magic. This place is a bit of a mad house though. Always seems to be a crowd and a bit of a wait, but their food is worth it. The staff was on point, providing great service all around. I particularly liked the dinning room atmosphere. Barbecue should be simply and delicious, and that's what you'll find here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is unique, unlike other bar-b-que places I've been to. The patio is much like a garden patio at a home with brick walls and plants high enough to block the traffic / side street noises.  The indoors has a rustic, yet, elligant patio feel to it with the brick walls and rustic wood ceilings.  The furniture is again, more of a patio feel than a typical bar-b-que restaurant.  The noise level was not too loud that you couldn't hear people at your own table. 

The food was wonderful! Although my husband said their burger was too greasy, that was the only downfall.  My brother and I had the St. Louis ribs.  The way they caramelize the bar-b-que sauce on the ribs is great. They aren't runny with sauce dripping down your hand. The rib meat falls off the bone and easy enough to eat with a fork or picking it up. 

The sides were great. I had the macaroni and cheese which was definitely homemade. Not runny and not too dry. The cheese flavor was not too strong either. 

 I would  be prepared to wait a bit for a table because they appeared to always be busy. Overall, I really enjoyed this place and would go back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent fall off the bone baby backs, perfectly grilled veggies and an outstanding coleslaw .  Highly recommended and fast!"}
{"text":"BBQ to remember! This was really very good. I had two beef ribs and brisket. The meat was smoked and tender. The BBQ sauce was delicious. The sides were creative and tasty. This is a destination restaurant. I would go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side for BBQ, but the food and ambiance here are great. Looks a little more upscale on the inside than what I had expected...reminds me of something somewhere between Charleston's and the Keg. This is a pleasant surprise, especially considering the location.

The portions are huge, definitely big enough to share (which helps with the cost) and there are probably going to be leftovers depending on what you order. I have sampled most of the BBQ on the menu and it is all delicious. They bring a carafe of mild and regular sauces to the table so there is no shortage of sweet-tangy-saucy deliciousness. Good selection of side dishes. I especially liked their cole slaw -- not too wet, not too sweet.

The server brings a little bag of fresh mini donuts sprinkled with cinnamon sugar at the end of the meal. They are pretty incredible!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, I wanna say decent service.. Waiter came by and commenced by greeting us and took our drink order, he didn't come back. Instead another younger kid came over and said \"hi I'll take care of you, the other guy got flustered and is gone\"! We didn't ask why or what but you must admit that's a bit weird no? 
Anyway this new waiter kid was good, he did take good care of us in the end :) 
Um the food was ok, good, decent, average.. No negative remarks about the actual food or even the place. I guess the only downfall is that it's located In a ghetto-esque neighborhood. And also they are overpriced. To me they are charging as if they are a fine dining spot, which they are not. It's a casual restaurant in a Not so great location. So yea no.  I might go back for a mai tai one day as That was the highlight of my evening there. Thanks."}
{"text":"My reviews are pretty much good and some of the places I don't care for ; never really in between , so I apologize .  Bobby Q is AWESOME! My husband and I drive by when going to the airport and its always strikes curiosity .  My husband picked me up from the airport and we decided to give it ago.  The restaurant was much nicer than expected and cool atmosphere actually.  My husband had the bobby q burger which was yummy and the beer battered fries ...delish. I ordered brisket and baby back ribs with the intention to have leftovers, The brisket was perfectly cooked , so moist and flavorful. The Ribs ; perfect Smokey flavor and fork friendly.  If you ever questioned on whether you should check it out or not...JUST DO IT !"}
{"text":"Definitely liked this place. After my cousin convinced me to come here (because I'm not a huge fan of BBQ) I was pleased. I ordered the country fried chicken. It comes with mash potatoes and choice of one side (I chose Mac&Cheese....I know two starches). The cornbread is complimentary, super hot and yummy. My friend ordered the baby back ribs with Mac and baked potatoes (2 starches again). I tried some of her ribs and they were really good, falling off the bone good. I definitely would come back when I visit Arizona. I would love to try the pulled pork or the beef brisket. At the end of your meal they give you a bag of complimentary donuts that resembles the taste of churros. 

My waiter was really nice and very attentive to us as we told him it was our first time dining at the establishment. The manager even walked over to us to make sure everything was fine. The staff appeared to be really nice and courteous."}
{"text":"Im from KC so my standards for BBQ are high. Bobby Q's isn't pretty bad BBQ. I had the St Louis ribs and the Baby Back ribs for lunch. Both were full of fat and grissle. To much BBQ sauce. I could not finish eating them

The service was not that good.  I think we were doing the sever a favor eating at one of his tables."}
{"text":"It's an All American BBQ joint... with an adjunct, weekend Latino dance club.... Yeop.

What you MUST order:

Appetizer: Q- Roll
Side: Mac n Cheese
Main Dish: Anything

Alcoholic Beverage: Shipwrecked.... only need one for the WHOLE table

Try to sit outside, really nice atmosphere.

Fish Fry Fridays during Lent (comes with Two sides for $10.99)! And don't forget to tell the waiter about the Yelp 10% off Discount! AND you don't even need to order dessert because they give you FREE Cinnamon and Sugar Donut Holes!

Unusual thing is that on Friday and Saturday nights there's another side of the bar that opens into a club. Does NOT affect the dining experience.  Our Cabbie told us it was SUPER GHETTO, we'd probably be mauled immediately upon entrance, and possibly beat up by thugs- not the case. Very safe."}
{"text":"Very solid experience!  This is a well put together restaurant.  Decor and ambience are very comfortable.  Place is very clean with a good energy.  Management is very visible and seem to spend a lot of time checking on there guests to ensure satisfaction.  

We had the the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.  The fried chicken and gravy were excellent.  Good flavor all around and crispy crust on the chicken.  Chicken was moist and flavorful.  Gravy was also tasty and mashed potatoes were very good.  Mac and cheese was just ok. Not bad.  We also ordered the baby back ribs with a green salad and corn.  Baby back ribs were excellent fall off the bone, tender and juicy. The salad was very fresh, good size with tomatoes onions, cucumbers, croutons and homemade ranch dressing. Yum.  The only disappointment was the corn. It was mushy and swimming in greasy butter like sauce.  They need to change this one up.  Fresh corn on the cob with seasoned butter to the side would be a better option and a more worthy accompaniment to the rest of the delicious food.  

Service was spot on throughout, but getting check closed out was a bit slow, but not much to complain  about.  All in all a pretty great experience.  We'll be back and excited that they will have a new location soon at 32nd and Camelback!"}
{"text":"came to bobby q's and split the lunch platter with a friend. we got the brisket, ribs, BBQ chicken and mac & cheese and added a side of mashed potatoes. i appreciated that they split everything for us in the kitchen and then sent out our order on separate plates at no extra cost; nice touch! everything was freaking DELICIOUS and i highly recommend the brisket. my only sort of issue was that the side we added was $4 and it wasn't a large portion at all. BUT for $10 a person including tip, we were able to try a couple different things and leave full but not too full so i'll call that a win. i will definitely be back to try dinner and to sit on their gorgeous patio when phoenix doesn't feel like the surface of the sun. it also looked like they had a good HH!"}
{"text":"Outstanding meat!! Great place to eat. The service was great. Awesome hot mini doughnuts after the meal!!"}
{"text":"We had a large party on Saturday night and were promptly seated when at least ten guests arrived.

I ordered the Firebird Rotisserie Chicken with potato salad and grilled vegetables on the side.  The chicken was perfectly cooked with moist breast and dark meat.  We also enjoyed their famous homemade cornbread.  My buddies went straight to the red meat, which I looked at with envy.

I definitely will return here."}
{"text":"We were in town to visit my nephew at GCU and figured he was tired of eating the typical college diet of cup-o-noodles and cafeteria food so we looked for a good place to eat nearby that could satisfy the hunger of five very hungry men.  After reading the other reviews we decided to treat him and his roommate to some real food.  We were not disappointed.  We started with appetizers that were brisket filled Q-Rolls (A twist on the egg-roll).  All I could say was WOW/AMAZING. The platter we ordered included brisket that was so moist that it literally melted in your mouth.  The baby back ribs fell off the bone and the pulled pork and beef ribs were flavorful and cooked perfectly.  Best BBQ west of Kansas City. And the Mac and Cheese as a side, well...don't tell my mother (sorry Nana), but it was the best I'd ever had, and I've had a lot of mac and cheese in my day.  And the corn bread....The best corn-bread I have ever eaten, and I'm usually not a fan. I probably ate more than I should have, but hey \"when in Rome\".  My father (Apa) is a big BBQ fan and this will definitely be on the list of places to stop and eat at when we go back. Great service and ambiance as well.  The waiter and manager checked on us regularly and took care of us as if we were locals."}
{"text":"I was a little tentative about a BBQ place in Phoenix but after reading the yelp reviews i decided to give it a chance! The ribs are amazing, ok the food was amazing, I would say the pieces of brisket I had were good but not Texas brisket! Could have been the cut I had but the ribs were \"slap yo momma good\"!!! I had corn and Mac and cheese as a side, the Mac is super cheesy borderline overly cheesy but the corn was good! My kids fries were very good too! Love the corn bread and we are awaiting our donuts! 

I will be back although it seemed a bit pricey for bbq but they also didn't serve it on paper and plastic, they have real plates here! Lol!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite resturants in Phoenix. Their baby back ribs are incredible way better than any ribs I've had in a long time dont get me wrong my step dad can cook the hell out of some ribs but this joint right here deserve all 5 stars plus more. Came here for a girls night and i very impressed from the atmosphere to the food..."}
{"text":"What is the point of having a reservation system if you are going to make reservations wait for their table. The whole point I reserved was to avoid the wait. Food is great and all but service? They really need to work it out better."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, I ahd the brisket and it melted in your mouth. I would love to try them for dinner and have some beers! I will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Top-notch, enthusiastic waiter who understands customer service; outstanding food!  An expansive menu with big satisfying portions!  Very clean and organized restaurant, which tells me management takes pride in this establishment.  My only negative comment:  the young girl taking us to our table was quite rude.  If the hostess/greeter was welcoming and friendly I would rate 5-stars on a first visit.  For those residing in the East Valley, it is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The food and service here was amazing! Made a pit stop for some food before heading to the airport after hiking havasupai and was very happy with the outcome. Shannon the manager made sure to stop by our table and introduce herself which we appreciated, our server (i think her name was Natalie) did a GREAT job with recommending food unlike most restaurants where they tend to lack that. The food was so good! We can't wait till our next trip back to arizona this is definitely a place worth going to! From the service to the food to the free donuts at the end!"}
{"text":"the mai tai is the BEST!!!
the mach and cheese omg is to die for so thick and creamy super cheesey. everything on the menu is just pure bliss."}
{"text":"Back in the 70's this was THE spot to go before/after prim when it was Bobby McGee's Conglomeration.  Waiters in costume, bathtub salad bar and the best disco !  We loved it then, took our son when he turned 17 (13 years ago) and the place always had a soft spot in our hearts.  Then it changed with the times and became Bobby Q's BBQ.  The hubby and I had to try it after all our times there in high school, college and beyond.  We were very pleasantly surprised at the change and delighted with the food!  The BBQ us terrific and shows how their slow cooking technique pays off.  I love the fries and the salads are good too.  A nice stiff cocktail arrives when ordered and the service is mighty good.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are HUGE!  The crowning jewel are the hot little biscuit dough donuts like Mom used to make with cinnamon and sugar; served in a paper bag.  A great family spot with rich history."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice, once for dinner, once for lunch.

When I came for dinner I was impressed by the food (especially the mud pie) and the service; but this last time coming in for lunch, I had such wonderful service and food that I had to say something.

The hostess greeting was quick and super pleasant. Great!

The waiter, Jacob was patient and more than happy to explain the menu and answer questions. Great!

When it came to changing our minds on stuff, he was completely professional and did not make us feel bad at all!! Totally great!

Also, when we had a question about the bill, he was good enough to listen to us and take care of the issue. THAT, was fabulous customer service!! Thank you Jacob for being the highlight of our visit! I will definitely go back there - hopefully when Jacob is working!

BTW - the food was absolutely delish!!    :)"}
{"text":"Darn good BBQ. Not nearly as good as Bryan's Black Mountain BBQ in Cave Creek, or Little Miss, but solid for Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a BBQ fan. St. Louis, Chicago, Philly, Memphis, Texas I love em all. I have often dragged my wife on BBQ treks for hundreds of miles. With that being said I have to begin by saying that Bobby Q has EXCELLENT BBQ. Tender, smoky and chock full o' flavor. I have been here multiple times and have never had anything that disappointed me...until last night. An event so treacherous and diabolical that it prevented me from rating them with 5 stars. The horror!

The in-laws were in from the East Coast and we decided to take them there for dinner. Everything was smashing and up to par as usual until dessert came. Now I have to go on record as saying that I always loved the heaping pile of scrumptious peach cobbler that they serve on the dessert menu. So much so that I convinced my table of 6 to order 3 since they are usually large enough to share and stunningly delicious. Every time I go to Bobby Q I finish off my meal with it and love to complain to my wife as I waddle out of the building (in the grand tradition of glutinous American excess) that I ate too much and my belly hurt. I was looking forward to lamenting my fate yet again last night. But alas, I was in for a shocking turn of events and was dubbed a deceitful liar by the entire table. 

To my horror when the cobblers arrived, they were measly, sickly, ill-prepared portions and a pale shadow of what they were on previous visits. We were plagued with three bowls of undercooked (as in practically raw) peaches that tasted like they were straight from a can and a soggy, undercooked thin square of \"crust\" sitting on top as an afterthought.  This flavorless absurdity could only have been more demeaning if it were capable of speech and threw dated insults at us. It literally looked like they dumped half a can of uncooked peach slices in a bowl and threw a wet piece of thin white bread on top. All three servings were like this. Now on EVERY occasion in the past the cobbler was gigantic, actually was cooked and warm, had a delectable FULL crust and tasted like it came out of Gramma' Cobbler's oven fresh. To this peach cobbler bizarro universe doppelganger I spit at thee and thine preparer. Bah I say. BAH.

Of course, we complained to the waitress who was nice but said she didn't know that it was any different from normal.  She went back to whoever prepared them and came back saying that the preparer said \"they're the same as they always were\" which either proved the preparer's incompetence or their willingness to shame the establishment with a bowl full of cobbler-like lies. Our waitress even said she talked to the manager who went back to speak with the preparer...but said manager never came out to either see the imposter cobblers or speak with us about it, which rates as quite poor customer service.  Overall, it left a dark mark on an otherwise belly -bustingly deeeelicious visit. Shame on you Robert Q, shame. 

So, I will still eat at Bobby Q. as their dinner fare IS fantastic (assuming there are no more obvious but blatently denied changes such as with the cobbler), the environment is cozy and the staff are (generally) quite pleasant. However,  I will be wary about ordering the dessert in the future and about the quality and integrity of their customer service skills. I would advise you to use the same caution."}
{"text":"This place reminds me alot like Lucille's smokehouse BBQ and grill back home in California. Actually it did alot! I loved it though! The whole restaurant was absolutely adorable and they had a gorgeous patio area. We went in for lunch so we didn't really get to try anything they specialized in. We both had pulled pork, & oh my gosh it was so good! And their steamed veggies were perfectly cooked. Our server was cute and very friendly. We were her last table I could tell (I'm a server myself) anyways she was still very attentive and polite didn't make us feel rushed at all. I'll definitely be back for dinner!"}
{"text":"I  visit Phoenix frequently from Houston and I must say this place is one of the best. From burgers to ribs you cannot go wrong with any entrée at Bobby Q's. Tonight I tried the smokehouse burger and was extremely impressed with the flavor and quality. Portion size is it generous and the staff is top notch. I always look forward to my next visit to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Anyone that knows anything about BBQ and large chain restaurants knows that it is extremely hard to mass produce BBQ and still make it delicious. For this very reason I was skeptical about going to Bobby Q. Then I looked at the ratings and saw that the restaurant has a greater than 4 star rating. I HAD TO GIVE IT A SHOT! 

I ordered the full rack of ribs and loaded baked potato with mac and cheese on the side. WHOA! I must say that Bobby Q thoroughly impressed me! The smokey taste and tenderness of the ribs was out of control. Not to mention, when I was done, I was full as a tick! I actually thought I was the one in the back of the restaurant Q'ing it up on the smoker. But after I woke up from my daydream, I realized that Bobby Q is or SHOULD BE a staple in the greater Phoenix area. 

When I come back to Phoenix, this is definitely one of the restaurants that I will have to indulge in a repeat visit, just to make sure I wasn't in a dream of bliss and desire. 

Bobby Q's... Phoenix is supposed to be well known for Mexican food and taco shops, well, my friends, you have made your mark, I will remember Bobby Q's for BBQ!"}
{"text":"Great service & lunch was amazing.  Ordered baked potato with all the fixin's (it was amazing) and the bartender made me tasty lemon drops.
 will go back again and again"}
{"text":"It was good, not over the top great.  We had the smoked brisket.  It was tender with good flavor but fatty.  I had two slices that were pure fat.  I mentioned that to our server and it was shrugged off. The Mac and cheese was nice and creamy.  Veggies were just ok.  The best part was the little donuts they brought us at the end of the meal.  I won't order the brisket again. The atmosphere is really cool.  Enough so that I may try happy hour."}
{"text":"Omg some of the best food I have had in a long time. We ordered the Q rolls as an appitizer. This is basically a brisket egg roll, these were yummy. I ordered the 12 oz. Top sirloin,  I was a little disappointed that it was not quite the way I order it. The mac and cheese was just awesome. I dare say it was almost better than my dads. My husband order the sirloin as well and enjoyed it but didn't care for the shoestring fries. All in all a good meal."}
{"text":"Holy moly! This place did not disappoint and once again the Yelp reviews are correct! Service, flavors, portions, and the surprise brown bag of goodies at the end of our meal made this place onto my \"I will return\" list and it is highly recommended. Great BBQ!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good BBQ.  The cornbread that comes before the meal is also delicious.  I like that it is closer to where I live, because I usually have to drive further to get to a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"BBQ sauce was tasty! Atmosphere was very nice and good was served quick and tasted good. My only complaint is that I found some of the meat to be a bit fatty."}
{"text":"Came in from San Diego to watch the Angels play and the service this place was horrible!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am beginning to think that the reason I love barbecue restaurants so much is the fact that I ALWAYS get two meals out of one visit.  That figures out, on average, to about 7-8 bucks a meal, and you can't really beat that for great food!

The husband and I decided to go here on Friday night, and the place was busy, but not so busy that we were able to be immediately seated.  Our service was fantastic.  I'm beginning to think that restaurants are recognizing our faces from our pictures because this was beyond good service.  Our server was super quick and very sweet.  Our food came out impossibly fast too.

The food was delicious.  I ordered the brisket platter, of course, and it was super yummy.  I got a big fat helping of tender brisket and two sides.  I chose the pecan cole slaw and the mac and cheese.  We also got cornbread with our meals.  The cornbread is really yummy, but strangely shaped into little disks.  The cole slaw was very good, with a great sweet flavor that was enhanced by the crunch of the pecans.  The mac and cheese was literally rib-stickin good.  It was the super thick and creamy kind that makes me weak in the knees.  The barbecue sauce served on the meat is fairly minimal, but they bring you plenty of extra so you don't have to worry.  

I would definitely come back here.  I loved the food, the service and the atmosphere.  I would definitely recommend this for good sit down service BBQ."}
{"text":"A roadtrip would not be complete without local BBQ and Bobby's does not disappoint!

Fancy smancy table service
Dark and cool with bar seating
Rotisserie chick and bragging about the ribs. Alex was friendly and rattled off drink specials. Other servers were chatting with friends at the bar and one, blond one dipped into her cleavage for something. I hope she washes her hands before serving up a meal. Now I look around, this is a breaking ground for hooters. Low cut and falling out. Not a fan of that. 
Bobby Q Amber Ale (Sonoran Brewing) is too light with a bitter bite. Not my type of amber but they tried. 
2 meats, brisket & sausage w/ mac&cheese and...the pecan coleslaw? What the heck for $18.  
Pulled pork sandwich $10
2 meat with pork and brisket 
Ranch House Salad
Corn bread (pucks) of sweet, warm goodness.

Sides were great! The beans with zest, the M&C takes me back to old school cafeteria, the potato salad was fantastic and the slaw was great with the pecan. 
Brisket was the clear winner from the table and we all loved the smoky sausage. The pulled pork was a disappointing third as it was dry. Good thing I went with brisket. 
Two thumbs up here kids. Well worth your time and money. Yelp check in brought a 10% off the total tab too."}
{"text":"Ordered the Combination of Half a Slab of Baby Back Ribs and Catfish, along with Baked Potato,  Mac and Cheese and Roasted Corn. Quite a complete meal that we shared it among 2 people and still could not eat all of it. The Baby Back Ribs were super tender and moist and as a cut each rib, the meat would just fall off the bone. The Catfish was good, would have been nice with some tarter sauce. The sides were average, not great, but not bad. The baked potato was loaded with butter, sour cream, chives and Bacon so that was a winner, the mac and cheese was good but when the waitress said that is their recommendation and the best side, I expected a little more. The Roasted Corn when we ordered expected a ear of corn roasted over a grill, but what we received was an inch of 2 ends of corn on the cob and loose corn kernels in a small bowl which could have been corn from a can.

Salmon Dinner was a generous slab of fish and was well prepared. It was grilled and had a good crisp grilled skin which was very good and it came with 2 sides which my daughter choose the mac and cheese plus vegetables. 

Cornbread is very good and the waiter was generous enough to give us another basket. 

At the end if your meal, wait for the sugar donuts! Served warm they are killer!

Overall experience was very good with service and ability to park while restaurant was busy."}
{"text":"The food and the staff here are amazing. Best prime rib I have had in a long time. 
Yesterday was my wife's 45th birthday and we had some guests that surprised her from out of town and we chose to celebrate at Bobby Q's on 27th ave. There was a minor problem with our wait time and our seating and I was a little upset. 
That did not last long. After talking to the amazingly awesome manager Taylor, he had us sitting at a perfect table and had two of his best waitresses Shauntel and Stacie waiting on us. Let me tell you that this was the best restaurant experience that I have ever had and I was truelly impressed. Taylor, Shauntel, and Stacie went above and beyond to make my wife's birthday celebration a very memorable one. The food was just as amazing as the staff.
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for the best BBQ in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Called for a reservation...needed to wait an hour to get in, but I would rather chill in our hotel suite than trying to awkwardly stay out of the way, waiting for a table for an hour there. We got there and were instantly greeted and instantly seated! So far everything was fantastic! Our server, Carmela, came right over...and was super sweet, complete with great service through out our meal! I had a cup of baked potato soup which was good...not fabulous...but good. The corn bread, on the other hand, was amazing...not sure how they made it so perfectly...but I need it everyday! The brisket was excellent, the roni's and cheese was scrumptious! The shoestring fries...were shoestring fries...nothing special...but ultimately sides don't really matter! The portions were very generous, couldn't finish my meal...and I really wanted to! And then the little Thank Q donut holes were a nice, sweet little touch of dessert! Unfortunately, we live in CA, so we won't be able to come back...unless through some kismet, chance of serendipity we end up back at the second bbq heaven on earth!! If you live by here or find yourself at one of the nearby hotels, then by all means stop in for a great, hearty meal!"}
{"text":"THE BEST RIBS I'VE HAD HANDS DOWN!! The meat was perfectly cooked and the portions are so big for such a good price! My bf and I shared a half rack of ribs and got two sides and were completely stuffed, all for $20! They even gave us extra corn bread as an appetizer! And free dessert! Love this place!"}
{"text":"What a great place. The manager Laura greeted us and she was so friendly that it just set the tone of the rest of our lunch. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Had the sampler and the baby backs and if I had to pick, the pulled pork was our favorite. Corn bread was great as was the potato salad. Apple cobbler was great as well. Will definitely return if I'm ever in Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"Wow... Where to start. Pulled up and the parking lot was packed. Almost turned around and went somewhere else but everyone I had talked to about this place said it was amazing food... And it was my birthday, so being a special occasion, we waited for a parking spot.

Got seated in less than 3 minutes. Only draw back... Right by the cooking chickens. Really the hottest seat in the place!  But it was a cold night so we didn't complain. And the table is right by the kitchen but it wasn't loud like most restaurants.

Ordered cocktails and an appetizer. Mine was supposed to be served in a pineapple but arrived in a regular glass. Kind of a let down. But it was strong and good. And that's where the issues stopped.

Ordered the Spinach Artichoke dip. SO GOOD! The tomatillo salsa that accompanied it was devine.

I ordered the Jumbo baked potato with brisket and my mom got the brisket platter. The brisket is so tinder and delicious it just crumbles. We asked for extra BBQ sauce and the server brought out the original and Carolina. Their Carolina is a red sauce and not a Carolina gold. Peppery and spicy. But good. We both preferred the original. More on the sweeter side.  Both ordered the Mac & Cheese and my mom ordered the Pecan Cole Slaw. Mac & Cheese was heavenly. And mom loved the slaw.

I have a walnut allergy so it sadly limited my desert fare. Ended up with the Bread Pudding. It was really good... But by that point we could only eat a few bites as we were stuffed and were taking home leftovers. 

The staff was very nice and spent time with us. And the GM spent time with us on the patio talking about the company history and transition to BBQ (we were long time customers of their Bobby McGees in California).

In summation.... GO!  You won't be disappointed! I've been back since to order the baked potato to go. Even better the second time around!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was packed and even though there was a wait list we got seated right away.  However, we had to wait at our table a really long time and I think they forgot about us but the waiter apologized and gave us a free appetizer.  In terms of the food - appetizer 4, baby backs 5, spare ribs 5, chicken 4, sausage 3, mac and cheese 4, roasted corn 5, corn bread 4, potato salad 4, cinnamon sugar donuts 4.  Overall, really excellent barbecue."}
{"text":"My husband had requested BBQ ribs for our anniversary dinner so I searched yelp and found Bobby Qs. We live in Goodyear so it was a bit of a drive but worth every mile. The cornbread was warm and fresh, we had the Whole hog platter and have enough leftover for at least one more meal. The baby back ribs were melt-in-your-mouth good, the pulled pork and brisket to die for, the grilled corn sweet and buttery.  It is now our new favorite BBQ restaurant. Laura, the manager, was friendly and very warm."}
{"text":"Well I always heard about Bobby Q's and when I got a chance for a carry out I jumped on it...I should have went with my son and his dad. They had been there the night before so I munched on their leftovers when they first went (Flintstone beef bone)...man my mouth is watering just thinking about their beef ribs and corn. Awesome and Oh so good. Well I got their chicken (and mind you I was ribbed out from munching on leftovers). My son and his dad got the ribs again and when they came with my order (the chicken) I was very very very disappointed. So bad that I was trading it for just a bite of the rib. My son liked it and thought I was crazy but it just looked like 1 breast or cut thigh. I was looking for a two pc or something. Oh well. I enjoyed the corn, the cornbread and the gravy. All in all I will stick to their beef ribs when I go."}
{"text":"Great barbecue tucked into a not so busy area. I got the  pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese. Such a good meal and really cool place. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing fall off the bone, pull apart with a fork, melt in your mouth BBQ. Had the baby back ribs and brisket. The ribs were very meaty and just fell of the bone, so tender. The brisket was also very tender and juicy. BBQ sauce was solid as were the mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. Some of the best BBQ I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"Took an hour to get our food however the hostess apologized and complemented our table with free desserts.  Large portions are served and you don't leave hungry. The food was amazing and drinks were OK. I highly recommend the ribs, they're Soooo amazing! Another of our new favorites. The neighborhood was a bit sketchy though but ok."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant! We went here for a group dinner and it was a bit loud and hard to hear everyone at the table, but the food was amazing! I thought the brisket was one of the best I've ever had, if not THE best. It was so juicy and tender and very flavorful. Also, the baby back ribs were also to die for. They give you corn bread to start that is super delicious and end with FRESH mini donuts that were just fried. I can't wait to go back!"}
