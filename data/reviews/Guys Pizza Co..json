{"text":"Definitely the worst wings I've ever eaten.  They were delivered with hardly any sauce on any of the 3 flavors I ordered (Big Easy, Spicy Garlic and Cajun).  They all tasted the same, which was bland.  I'll never eat at Guys Pizza Co again.  It was that bad."}
{"text":"The name is spot on as it's definitely not the place you take girls to. With an offering of funnel cakes, their menu is unmatched by any establishment outside amusement parks. Their guyzones gives Dewey's calzones a run for their money. They are probably not as healthy, but they're extremely easy to eat since they're sliced into tasty strips. Try one with gyro meat and get tzatziki sauce on the side. You won't be disappointed.  The guy at the counter hooked me up with a $5 coupon as well."}
{"text":"If you love deep dish, Guys Pizza will be one of your favorite take-outs. I've never eaten there - it looks weird. And I can only speak for the deep dish - it's fantastic so I may never try the regular. Ever.   Up to four toppings (fillings?) of your choice then take it home and indulge in the salty, saucy decadence in your jammies while catching up on your favorite shows on Hulu. They probably deliver but it's like a block from my house so I've never tried that but the staff inside is super friendly and low-key.   I'm not going to be able to recommend the regular wings, however - we've tried them twice and both times the sauce doesn't even stick to them, which is weird and off-putting. The boneless wings are pretty good."}
{"text":"iT'S SO SO! I have had way better pizza...however their delivery driver was great!  Their big dad pizza is pretty good and I prefer their spicy sauce over their sweet style."}
{"text":"You can get better pizza at any convenice store in the 2 pack for $3.99, and not have to deal with the douchebag crowd that tends to gather for the bar - Avenue Tap House.  Anyone who is giving their food rave reviews either is related to the owner, works there, or has had 5 too many Jagr-bombs."}
{"text":"I was really excited to order take out from this place on a lazy Saturday night after I had sampled a couple slices of their sheet pizza at the Lakewood location. But it was kind of a disappointing experience. Huge props for them allowing you to order specialty pizzas by the half at no extra charge, but when we got the pizza (a sweet hawaiian with brown sugar that tasted like cinnamon to me) and the texas BBQ, it was just OK. All the menu options sound great .It might have been the execution at the Fairview Park branch, but both pizzas were very lacking in sauce, toppings and overall appeal. They were really dry and just not what I was hoping. We also ordered a small house salad. For $4 I wasn't expecting much, and that's definitely what I got. I might try it again. Maybe being drunk will help."}
{"text":"I'd been thinking about trying Guy's for a while now, ever since I'd heard they'd put one in just down the street where I used to bowl. After it all: color me disappointed.   First and foremost, quoting a twenty minute pick-up time, only to have customers waiting for forty-five is wholly unacceptable. I understand that you're trying to fit a kitchen in a closet, and that you were moderately busy. Having drivers making food, only to run it out of the kitchen immediately in front of customers, while swearing at everyone else in the kitchen is unacceptable. Having salad ingredients all over the area where customers are meant to pick up food -- without any type of refrigeration? Completely, totally, wholly unacceptable. Sanitation is important, and I should have walked out as soon as I walked in. Again: If you're going to pack a full kitchen into a closet, do it right, or consider another option.  But now, the pizza which should be more important to people. Whoever said \"There's no such thing as bad pizza\" should avoid Guy's. It tasted as though someone had the thought to resurrect that wonderfully devoid of flavor and character pizza from the mid 80's chains like Domino's and Little Caesars. There was no crust (a sin in my book) and the sauce was more sweet than tomato. The toppings were bland -- the sausage looked like sausage, tasted like nothing -- and there weren't many of them, either.   With Angelo's, Danny Boy's, Dewey's, Player's and more in the area, Guy's isn't going to survive the weekend pizza wars, serving inferior, terrible product to people used to some of the greatest pizza in town."}
{"text":"Old number of the Lakewood location forwards to the new location in Fairview Park. They call it Guy's Pizza of Lakewood/Fairview Park. Just no. It's not in or near Lakewood, stop abusing the name. Just placed an order for pickup and walked over to the old Lakewood location which I found had closed."}
{"text":"They seem to have a huge menu, although I've never tried anything but the pizza slices.  They have gyros and burgers and all that good stuff.  I go here a lot because it's right around the corner from me.  The pizza is average (better after drinking).  Really cheesy.  The sauce is on the sweeter side which I'm not a huge fan of but hey...it's pizza. How bad can it be?  The crust...ehhhh...it could use some work.  But, the main advantage of this place is they have $1 slices ready to go, every day.  They also deliver beer.  These two main points are enough to make me a fan!"}
{"text":"This location is CLOSED.  Fun fact though: when you call the number it routes the call to their Rocky River location, something that would've been nice to know when I was placing my order, as opposed to when I showed up at the closed location to pick it up and the nice bartender at the Tap House next door told me I had to drive all the way to Rocky River.  At this point I considered saying forget it and going elsewhere, but I would've felt guilty sticking them with a pizza so I made the drive.    My disappointment was compounded when I arrived in River and was handed an unrecognizable pizza.  Guy's has never exactly been top of the line pizza, but I'm still used to it being gooey and cheesy and tasty.  It was a good middle ground if you didn't want to drop a lot of money on something a little nicer.  And hey, sometimes you're just in the mood for cheap pizza.  So I was more than a little let down when I saw a generic looking, thin crusted travesty in the box.  I'm not opposed to thin crusts when they're fluffy and delicious like at Dewey's, but this was nothing close to that.  This was flat and tasteless and gross.  It was like I was eating the box itself.  I've got half a pizza left and I'm seriously considering just throwing it away.     The bottom line is that I just drove all the way to Westgate and paid $12.50 for a pizza that was somehow worse than a $5 Hot'n'Ready from Little Ceasar's.  Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.  I'll be sticking with Gionino's or Dewey's from now on."}
{"text":"Bad even with a coupon.  I used a restaurant.com coupon and got my food to go but still got hit with the 18% gratuity which was very lame.  I had a deep dish pizza which was not done all the way(the cheese was not fully melted) and had water/sauce dripping to the bottom of the pizza making it the worse deep dish I ever had.  I also had a Mega Guyzone which is a calzone, It also was not done all the way as the cheese was also not melted all the way.  The bottom left a oil mark on the box that I will never forget as this must be the most unhealthy Calzone ever.  For what I paid for each of these Items I'd expect a lot more.  Even with $25 certificate I still needed to pay 20 bucks +the 10 bucks for the restaurant coupon which in the end I wish I ate there so I could have walked out for such terrible food and saved 20 bucks. Their fries are also nothing special.... This place will go out of business eventually"}
{"text":"I'm only giving 2 stars because the delivery driver was nice and prompt.  However, the pizza and salad were horrific.  We ordered a large house salad and Chicago Deep Dish with pepperoni, mushrooms and black olives.  They said it would be here in 45 minutes (which make me wonder...as a good deep dish takes time).  The pizza and salad actually arrived within 30 minutes, and as the drive pulled away, I opened the box.  The saddest pizza that ever was created sat in the box.  First, it was NOT a deep dish.  At the best, it could have been considered thick crust with very few toppings.  I hate half a piece and the grease overwhelmed me; I didn't eat any more.  My boyfriend at a piece, and we called to complain.  This pizza was over $18 ...and was inedible.  Whoever said there's no such thing as bad pizza would have retracted the statement after trying a piece.  In addition to being greasy, flavorless and gross, it had the wrong toppings.  When my boyfriend called to complain, the manager asked what we wanted to do about it.  He said refund my money.  And they did.  I do give credit to the manager for recognizing that bad product went out, and I hope this isn't common practice, but I will never order from Guys again."}
{"text":"\"We're jammin...i want to jam it with you!\" Do you remember those insipid Bob Marley lyrics resonating from the rafters of the Put In Bay bar on the west end of Lakewood? Well, you can still hear them, but now it's a late night pizza joint/ college bar. I've heard of Guys before as a pizza franchise, but this one is a unique venture. I just went in for a 1 a.m. pie. The adjoining bar, replete with obnoxious Monster energy drink neon sign and \"guido party lights\" almost made me lose my appetite.   The pies were average(dough a little tough, generous toppings), breadsticks were a bit plain. They were part of a coupon deal that saved me nine bucks all together. And bringing an idea i'd only heard of in actual college towns, they deliver beer. I don't know if that's been tried here before or until what time they can actually carry this out. All i know is certain Cleveland city councilmen and local sports anchors need to move to Lakewood to get in on this  suspended license-dodging miracle service.  I like the late night pie competition on that end of town. This place has the added benefit of letting one relive some of their worst college era shenanigans as well. Where's my Buckeye  necklace..."}
