{"text":"Shady place with terrible service walked out within 4 minutes of sitting in....the owner came up to my table after some time making me and my friend wait! Comes up and says to walk up to the counter to tell him the order! I mean way to keep up the customer service!!! don't even bother with this place terrible setting with gangsters and crooks doing shady stuff under every nook and crany you're warned!!!"}
{"text":"#137  First off, the ownership changed 2014 December. Let's get that out of the way.  I read some of the reviews after my first visit (the day that the Vancouver Canucks descended further into mediocrity after the Calgary Flames demolished them) and again after my 3rd visit (it was obvious which ones are fake based on the frequency and text but the one that is listed currently before mine was before the new ownership took over and could very well be accurate).  Oh and by the way, Go! FLAMES! Go!  Let's get it started up in here.  My 3rd visit so far, last night on 15 June, was by far the best. So, with no further delay, let's break it down:  Location:  Sitting on MacLeod Trail and 18th Ave SW means parking is limited (along 18th Ave SW anyway) but trust me (on the sunscreen), the search for a spot shall be rewarded (though my first time, Sascha F. and I had walked to it from the nearby Elbow River Casino).  Food:  In my three (3) trips, I have had two (2) medium pizzas on the first two (2) trips (I think they are called meat lovers) and one (1) medium donair pizza (last night). I think the latter is based on his donair sub sandwich (which apparently is a foot long and huge as I saw two (2) go to another table which, once I'm done with the pizza menu, I'll head for the sandwiches). The medium pizza easily feeds two (2) people (and many of Yelper's know and despise me but they know I can eat). Best tomato sauce and crust around and uber-fresh ingredients. If memory serves, it's $13.99 + GST for the pizza.  Drink:  On all three trips, I have had the mint tea which with just 1 cube of sugar added, a hot and tasty drink. On the 3rd trip, Empire upped the ante as I tried the Long Island Electric which has tequila, vodka, rum, gin, orange liquor, and 7-up (I am forgetting one of the liquors). This drink is so refreshing and the liquors mix so well that you do not realize it contains alcohol! By the way, the beer is reasonably priced if hard liquor is not your taste.  Decor:  It's on older building with a small space but with ample seating indoor and outdoor. The music is usually ripe for the mood including rap, chill, and avante garde. Beware that some of the rap music may offend (lyrically speaking). The place is dimly lit providing a chill atmosphere, comfortable cushion seats, different size tables and booths, and a TV to catch up on Tampa Bay's dismal failure in the NHL Stanley Cup Final (after they tried to fix the home games) or other sports events.  Shisha (God, I hope I spelled this right):  As I am relatively new to the Shisha world, I can say that the Blue Mist smells and tastes so good (especially if you drink the Long Island Electric after a puff). I can say that the Shisha here is better than the Shisha at the lounge close to MacLeod Trail World Health (about 20 blocks south of this location) based on the Blue Mist alone. Walking in, you can often smell other Shisha's so I have a lot to catch up on whereas the other place 20 blocks south kinda smells like sock sweat.  Clientele:  Minors are allowed from what I overheard but keep in mind, this is a Shisha establishment that serves alcohol as well. I know there are some party mom's so come have a good time.  That being said, the crowds vary and some even look sketchy but so far, everyone just has a great time there. No attitude whatsoever.  Service:  The owner and staff are very friendly and engage with the customer. This is what brought me back the 2nd time (in addition to the pizza). It is fun to watch first timers come in as a veteran (three (3) times now.. senior, expert, full of it); many seem nervous but once the staff greets them, you can see them relax.  Pros:  Open very late, great food, great drinks, great service, great atmosphere, great location, entertaining crowds, great food, great drinks, great service (oh wait, I already said that).  Cons:  Closed on Sundays (but hey, everyone needs a break) :); I guess I can just stay at home and sleep all day."}
{"text":"Been to Empire a couple times in the past, this time was great. Empire has gone through new ownership in the last year. Not only was this the best shisha experience i have had at Empire, but the food as amazing! Truly Full of flavour and spiced just right. I Tried the Chicken Shawarma and the Beef Shawarma wrap, and the side of hummus and garlic sauce, the pita bread was so light and refreshing. As for the decor, it's very casual, and the walls are covered with vintage wall paper, black and white. Great place for shisha and food. And the new management is very good, and good service."}
