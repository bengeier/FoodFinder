{"text":"Great food, wonderful service, convenient parking in underground below Nordstroms!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one night. Place was empty so service was good and food came quickly. Food presentation was good. The food was too expensive for the quality you're getting. The French onion soup was extremely salty with a thick base. Poutine was average. Fries and steak were cheap quality. Pizza crust tasted like cardboard. Couldn't even take the leftovers home. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I expected a bit more professionalism from our waitress. She wasn't sure what kinda of water we were served or coffee - it seemed strange, really. The food was consistent with previous visits (angel hair pasta)."}
{"text":"Bazille is on the third floor of Nordstrom in yorkdale mall. A few friends took me out for my birthday, and what a lovely treat it was.  My friend order the crab bisque and it was just rich and divine.  I ordered the calamari starter and it was perfectly cooked.  For my lunch I order the cilantro lime shrimp salad, and I cleared my plate.  10/10
My friends ordered the salmon salad and loved it.

For dessert we ordered the popular white chocolate bread pudding.  I can say hands down my new favourite dessert.  10/10
Would absolutely go back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here with a friend and the food was great. Our server was also super nice. The food is a little more on the pricey side from what I recall. 

I had a sandwich and my friend had a pizza. Her pizza was good but it had a bit too much olive oil on it. Overall the food was good not overly super amazing. It is hidden on the upper floor inside Nordstrom. I would go again if I was in Nordstrom shopping. 

4/5 stars!"}
{"text":"Located on the Nordstrom's 3rd floor this might be an alternate to the spots nearby which do get slammed on peak hours. The space is clean and has an open inviting feel. The menu is geared towards a break from shopping for a lighter meal and drink or two. 
The crab bisque caught my eye (the one served at the Nordstrom's cafe in the bay area having nostalgic value) and ordered the burger as well. 
The service is OK but does have gaps even though the place was mostly empty. I went through the wine list in case I revisit and found it to be decent. 
The bisque bowl was a decent sized serving with nice little chunks of crab meat. Creamy finish and I brought up the spice with black pepper. 
The burger itself was ho hum and little above what one would get at a fast food chain. I didn't like kalmata aioli and had to ask for ketchup. The fries are done well here and worth a try for sure. 
If you want to get away from the other mundane offerings in the mall or don't want to wait for eons this place is a decent alternate and from the looks of it well hidden secret."}
{"text":"Bazille is an alright option for a light meal. I would not advise coming here if you are really hungry. The service, interior and quality of food are all great, but the portions are too small. Because the menu is somewhat limited, you will also probably not be able to order two separate meals that go well together. So your only option would be to fill up yourself with carbs and sweets."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy restaurant with a good variety of food. We had a change of waitress while we were there, and the 1st waitress didn't get my order properly. It would have helped if she use a notepad to write down our order. I had to send back twice my food because it wasn't the correct order. The 2nd waitress was really nice about it and changed it. It wasn't the 2nd waitress' fault because the 1st waitress didn't write properly our order in the 1st place.
Any how, the food and dessert were very good."}
{"text":"After checking out Tesla 3 we decided to have lunch here on a lazy Sunday.

Ordered  the cilantro shrimp salad, Brussel sprouts, and the spring salad.  Omg those Brussel sprouts are amazing!!!  Crispy leafs with charred goodness and the perfectly cooked nuggets of green goodness.  YuM!!  The individual leafs of charred crispy goodness reminds me of roasted seeweed!

Tasty food and friendly service and a quiet atmosphere.  Definitely worth a return trip and certainly far more relaxing than the food court chaos."}
{"text":"Came to Yorkdale and it was super packed everywhere. We went to the food court but it was just chaotic...we then went to the Cheesecake Factory but the wait was over an hour. Finally looked on yelp and saw this place and it was truly a gem! 

I loved how quiet it was, no rushing and bumping into people. The food was also great. I had the pesto pizza with arugula while my bf got the bazille burger. The waitress recommended this fried cauliflower with curry dip and that was great too. The pizza had his amazing crispy crust and it was super flavorful. My bfs burger was very juicy as well.

Great place and I'm glad it's hidden away from all the chaos."}
{"text":"Came here on a week day with some other fellow moms. We were 4 with 3 strollers and there was ample space for all of us. Food was excellent although a bit pricey $15-25 for a main. I had the crab mac and cheese and it was very good. Cheesy without being strong and lots of crab bits. 

Surprisingly, Bazille is very baby friendly. I was surprised to see so many babies (maybe at least 50% of the place) on a Thursday afternoon. We were never rushed, and servers even offered to give us straws for our water (much appreciated). 
There is  a family change room out side of the restaurant at the back of the men's section on the 2nd floor, but it's a bit of a walk away. It would be nice if they can just put a change table in the restaurant washroom. 

Given that it's easy to park right underneath, this might be our go to meet up place. Not to mention direct acess tot he mall."}
{"text":"This is my third time at this restaurant inside Nordstrom. I really like it. I was here on a Saturday around noon and it wasn't too busy yet. I made a reservation on open table just in case. This place can get busy during lunch hour. Great menu and drink options. Cocktail of the day was Cosmo Mojito. We ordered French onion soup, tuna poke appetizer, salmon nicose salad, chicken club sandwich and tomato pasta from the kids menu, I added chicken. Everything tasted great and the service was attentive.  It's a great place for lunch and drinks. Nice Decor, clean and kid friendly, washroom facilities close by in the restaurant. It's pricey but good quality and portions and I would definitely come back here again. Nordstrom does it right for food too."}
{"text":"At times when you're in Yorkdale, it might often feel as though you're in a hoard of people, and there's not a single corner or space in the mall that allows you take a breather and have a bit of peace and quiet. 

Bazille, tucked on the third floor at Nordstrom, is a little oasis located in the mall. This place is definitely great for those who are looking to have a moment to sit down, have a quite bite, and just be able to talk to your friends without having to over shout each other. The food might not be one of the cheesecake factory, or RHW, or even Laduree or Nadege, but it's not bad for what it is. I went with my sister, and we ordered the special of the month Heirloom Tomatoes, with Burrata and Pesto. It wasn't an authentic Burrata but it was still quite delicious and refreshing! We also went for their fries with their kalamata aioli and the dip wasn't bad! Although it might not be your cup of tea if you're not a fan of olives. The french fries were crispy and well seasoned. We also ordered two drinks, I ordered the Vine Street cocktail and it was to die for! The entire reason as to why I came back to Bazille, was because of that cocktail! It's refreshing, and not watered down like many restaurants in the same price range do, and my sister ordered a red wine and according to her, it was great for what it was priced at. 

Their staff is also fantastic, and all of those who had helped us had an inviting smile on their face. Our waiter made sure that everything was okay and also asked if we had enjoyed our food and stay at the restaurant. Their customer service clearly screams that they value their guests.

Highly recommend, but the prices might be a bit pricey, though it's definitely a spot we'll be going to when we have an entire day of shopping to do."}
{"text":"Very friendly hosts and waitresses. Lovely environment and not overly crowded. I love coming to this place after a long day of shopping. Food is reasonably priced and ambiance is great. I had the Mac andCheese with crab meat and it's very filling and delicious."}
{"text":"The Ni√ßoise salad that I had was quite good. The salmon wasn't as fresh as I thought it would be. In terms of service, the servers were attentive and friendly. Overall, very nice place to treat yourself after a long day of shopping!"}
{"text":"Visited on a weeknight for a quiet and lovely meal with my momma bear.

Love dining and enjoying drinks in a department store. Feels really nostalgic for me! The restaurant ambiance itself is calm and overall the space was very clean. 

Our server was really lovely and checked up on us just the right amount of times. We appreciated her recommending a few dishes on the menu. I love the customer service experience at Nordstrom - I have never once been disappointed at any of their locations.

To start we chose the calamari to share. The squid was cooked perfectly - super tender plus the batter was light and crispy. Really enjoyed the sweet and sour type accompanying dipping sauce.

For my main I chose one of their special menu items, which was a lobster mac and cheese topped with dill breadcrumbs. Holy moly it was amazing. Just the right amount of salt, gooey cheese, and many chunks of tender lobster, all topped with crunchy dilly breadcrumbs. So good! My mom chose their margarita pizza, which was topped with fresh tomatoes, basil, and a fragrant garlic oil. She gave me a slice to try - it was awesome! I noticed they have a wood fire oven in the kitchen, a great tool to make an awesome pizza pie!

We didn't have enough room to try dessert on this visit but will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"FOOD is amazing! HIGHLY Recommend the Crab bisque soup with extra crostini and roasted Brussels sprout. Service is inconsistent. Waiters are not attentive to clients, however Julia, server was amazing! She was great and had amazing dialogue with clients. Shared great stories of her ink art work on her hands. Definitely would come back for Julia."}
{"text":"Top floor of Nordstroms. Nice place to take a break from shopping. Hostess pleasant and accommodating, she was going to sit us in the middle of the room but sat us in a nice comfy booth by the window when I requested a change.

I had the Salmon Nicoise salad. The salmon was overcooked but the salad was yummy. My friend had the Steak Frites. The steak was tender and flavorful especially with the herb butter and the fries were delicious. 

The waiter was sweet and very attentive; he kept our drink glasses full and tried to accommodate all our requests. The manager even made rounds to check in on all the patrons. Overall a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Food was not bad, Very overpriced. 
There's really not much to say as it all tasted very average. I don't think I would come back as it was nothing special.

We ordered the french onion soup which was not bad. The lobster Mac & Cheese was not tasty - there was no flavor. The Caesar salad was not bad & the tacos were very mediocre. 

On the plus side, because it was Mother's Day - they were giving out a slice of chocolate cake with caramel sauce. The cake was not moist and tasted like it had been in the fridge for a while. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"}
{"text":"Read a lot of good reviews about this restaurant.  It came through for me today.  It has very good ambience, very clean and modern restroom.  Good service and good food. I actually like to give it a 4 1/2 stars, but don't know how to tick 1/2 star.  See photos for my food star rating."}
{"text":"This place was the best hidden discovery I've ever found. Located on the third floor of Nordstrom this hidden restaurant has a great little menu. It's one of those places where you can eat for a day with family or even by yourself which I did. I ordered something small which was the Lobster bisque and the buratta. You can order the lobster bisque in a cup size or a bowl which is the bigger option. It tastes amazing and it's made with the freshest ingredients. I highly recommend it. The Buratta is also a great shareable on the menu and I like how it's cute for bite sized consumption unlike other places where you have to slice everything yourself. Overall a great place and pricing is excellent! I spent about $25 including tax and tip for the two"}
{"text":"Great ambience and waiter was extremely nice! Food came very fast and was delicious! Dessert menu is limited and is not good for individuals with nut allergies."}
{"text":"Believe or not this place is pretty family friendly and it has become my preferred place to grab a bite while I am at Yorkdale - mostly because I can't stand the mess that is Dine on 3; and Jamie's Italian has been a bit lacklustre as of late and I refuse to dance to the long wait times at the \"factory\". 

It is on the 3rd floor of Nordstrom's and the food is good and reasonable. 

While there is a fair amount of seating; it is quiet enough to have a meal with a toddler in tow and still feel comfortable enough to enjoy a meal. 

Pricing, it is fair, not too crazy expensive and the kids meal pricing is fantastic. 

Food wise, I usually get their club sandwich - which is really good - what I like about it are the crisp and crunchy green beans they add to the sandwich. Their fries are good as well. Another preference for their pasta as well. My little one loves their multigrain Mac and cheese; which she eats happily and with no complaints. 

Service here is great too - with crayons and a small activity book to keep them busy and they are more then happy to give the kids a balloon with an anchor weigh attached too. 

So yeah family friendly yes so come here instead of Dine on 3 or waiting in line at Cheesecake - you won't be too disappointed."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Bazille, it's never packed! Probably because people don't know that there is a restaurant on the top floor of Nordstrom. This is honestly my go-to place for \"Canadian\" food in Yorkdale Mall. Service is always good, the ambience is good (doesn't feel like you're in a department store) and most importantly, the food is amazing!! I believe their menu always changes once in awhile. However, they seem to always have the same staples, which include: pizza, crab bisque, and roasted chicken pasta of some sort. I always get these items and they never disappoint. The chefs here are able to make the chicken not dry. Whenever I go to these Canadian/American types of restaurant, no one knows how to cook chicken properly.  HOWEVER, Bazille cooks the chicken dish really well. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Popped in while on a quick shopping trip with our 3.5 month old. They were very accommodating with our stroller and need for a quieter spot. 

We had a pizza and some tacos. Both were very tasty. Especially the tacos. But they were tiny. Would have like to try their vegetable soup of the day but it had dairy. 

They do have sparkling and flat on tap for free which is nice. The prices are a little higher than your usual fare but I do think the quality is there to justify. 

Ambiance is very nice. Service was pretty good. I would have liked more allergy attention and actions (dairy). Maybe in the future."}
{"text":"Simple food made with high quality ingredients equals delicious. Every time we go to a Nordstrom we must dine in one of their restaurants, shopping is secondary. It's crazy to think you can consistently get good food in a department store, but it's true. Service is also excellent, and the atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming. Aside from the yummy food, I encourage coffee lovers to try their French press, it's excellent! For those of us that don't enjoy shopping, this certainly makes the whole experience a lot more palatable."}
{"text":"The restaurant is found on the top floor of Nordstrom. It is a legit restaurant and a very nice ambiance. You don't feel like you're inside a department store when you're in the restaurant. Most of the seating are booths which have walls that are tall enough to block out the bright lighting from outside and shoppers. It's also tucked back a little so you get great uninterrupted dining. The restaurant also has its own washroom so you don't need to walk out into the store. 

I had the most amazing Cilantro Lime Shrimp salad here. I normally find dinner salads only tolerable while I ration any meat topping. This salad though was so fresh, had great veg combinations and was so expertly seasoned that I found myself not even needing the meat breaks in between! That being said the shrimp were fat and cooked really well. The tortilla strips added a great crunch to the salad and were a nice starchy component."}
{"text":"Unfortunately after coming here for a 2nd time my 5 stars moved to a 3 star review.... I was totally unimpressed this time around. 

To begin with our server (Carissa) was extremely unprofessional ... you could tell she did NOT want to be working. First she couldn't remember the daily soup even though she complained she's been there alllllll day. Then she started telling us how she's \"so done with work today because her boyfriends phone died and she didn't know how to get a hold of him so she didn't know if she was sleeping at his house or her moms... and she closed the bar early cause she was so bored\" ... I get it ; everyone has bad days but you don't tell your customers that... fake it till you make it. 

Another thing that came across as off is the fact that they brought a bread \"basket\" with 1 half of bread split in half... with a bowl of olive oil, where's the balsamic? Why only 2 quarters of bread. Anyways...

My starter Cesar was tasteless, small and sad :( the best part of it was the huge cheese crisp that came with it. 

The calamari was tasty, definitely nice sized pieces of calamari ... I would order that again. 

My first time he was great, this time I don't think I'll return for a 3rd visit unless something's are changed."}
{"text":"I went shopping with my aunts at Yorkdale mall and we wanted to eat at Yorkdale for dinner due to the convenience. Yorkdale mall has quite a few restaurant selections but I found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to try it.  It had pretty good reviews. Bazille is located on the 3rd floor of Nordstrom. It's a more casual setting. My aunts and I ordered the fried calamari and 2 orders of blackened shrimp tacos as our appetizer. Each order or shrimp tacos come with 2 tacos.  Calamari was nice and crispy and came with a size of sweet chilli dipping sauce, great pair.  The shrimp tacos were also good but the taco shell was a bit stale.  We ordered 2 pasta dish to share. We ordered the house made chicken sausage with barrata cheese and rigatoni pasta in tomato sauce and the spicy shrimp chitarra pasta which is made with bucatini. My favourite was the rigatoni.  The chicken sausage was spicy and delicious.  Both pastas were delicious however it came to our table cold:(. Service was great and efficient. I unfortunately had to take one star off for the pasta being cold and the taco shells being stale.  We were too full for dessert but will come back and try it next time."}
{"text":"3 star + 0.5 star for service

Bazille might not serves gourmet food but as a little cafe inside Nordstorm, I was pleasantly surprised!

Yorkdale can feels like a zoo at any time of the day. Sometimes you just want to go somewhere quiet without fighting the crowds, Bazille might be perfect for you. This might not be the place that you want to see and be seen, but a place where you can catch up with your friends or just have a quiet meal.

The menu is small but in a good way. We ended up sharing

Crisp Calamari ($12.95) - crispy, tender and light, I will skip the dipping sauce
Prosciutto & Arugula ($15.50) - the crust is more shortbread style, lemon arugula has a nice tartness
French Press Coffee ($4.50) - good size to share! 

Our waitress has such nice welcoming smile!! Service alone worth that extra 0.5 star."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday meal and had the pizza.  My sister had the salmon salad and my niece had the burger.

They have this olive aioli that was the bomb and they have little child pepper seasoning that was spicy but tasty.

They also give out free bread.  If you don't get them just request for it and they'll bring it over.

Ambience is nice but I think their alcoholic drinks are a little too pricy.  $13 for a cocktail is just highway robbery for me.  I just can't pay the price for that knowing for that money I can buy a bottle of  wine.

Prices for food are okay.  Not too expensive."}
{"text":"I came here last week for lunch. I was expecting the place to look a little more upscale? But it was just a normal looking place. The service was good. I had the chicken sandwich with fries. The fries were really tasty and the sandwich was just okay. Nothing i'd be crazy to go back for though!"}
{"text":"Located on the third floor of Nordstrom at Yorkdale, Bazille is a restaurant that serves up bistro cuisine in a contemporary environment. My party and I dropped by on a Saturday around 12pm for lunch. During our meal, the restaurant filled up quickly with diners taking a break from their shopping.

To start, my party of 4 shared the calamari. The calamari batter was crispy and light and paired well with the lemongrass sweet chili dipping sauce. For the mains, I ordered one of the specials of the day (the Thai steak salad) as well as a cup of crab bisque as I was feeling hungry. The rest of my party ordered the smoked meat sandwich (which was another daily special), the nicoise salad with wild salmon, and the sauteed chicken and angel hair pasta. My salad and soup were great. The soup was rich and creamy but not terribly heavy.In addition to the crab, there were also vegetables in the soup. My Thai steak salad was also great with vermicelli noodles and romaine lettuce. The rest of my party also enjoyed their food.

Overall, friendly service and good food."}
