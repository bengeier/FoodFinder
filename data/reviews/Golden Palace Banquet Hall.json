{"text":"We decided to give this place a try for dinner, and boy was it disappointing. This place was really dirty. Within 15 minutes I already saw 2 cockroaches crawling on the chairs! And if that's not enough, the dishes were full of colorful crusted food, just like what another reviewer here has mentioned.  Food was just so so and the waiters were rather impolite.  The place was also dead quiet during dinner time too. Their predecessor, Diamond, was definitely better managed."}
{"text":"This place is not super busy, but I really don't enjoy the noise level at dimsum place.  I think the noise level closer resemble a concert.  The food was okay, nothing spectular.  I like the pork blood pudding with vegetables as it was quite tasty.  The tea that we were given was subpar since it has this really bitter after taste.  I would only come to this place because my parents really wanted dimsum and the other restaurant we really wanted to go was super busy."}
{"text":"Used to be Diamond Banuet Hall  Came here for a banquet dinner for a special occasion.   We had 5 tables and had our own private room, which was nice.  Since I wasn't the host of this dinner, I can't go into details of what happened, but they messed up the menu.  There was a dish that was specially requested and the host called several times to confirm that this was available, only to find out during dinner that this dish was not available.  Discussions with the manager solved nothing.  One supervisor!manager was distributing bowls and plates at our table with a bandaid on her thumb.  When I noticed that she was using this thumb to hold the plates and bowls while distributing, I asked about the cleanliness of this and she \"reassured\" me that she brought the bandaids from home and are clean.... I didn't push any further with this because she clearly had no idea what I was trying to get at (use a glove!!!!!).  The servers were all very friendly and efficient.  One server accidentally knocked over a glass at our table and was extremely apologetic...Complete opposite of the managers.  Food...was average. Out of the 10 courses we had, I would say half were good enough for me to order again, 3 were questionable and 2 were terrible.  To end, horrible service, average food."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for dim sum weekly. They have all the regular fixings and the some speciality items like durian pastry.   It is considered the cheaper side in terms of pricing - set price before 11am - but I recommend coming early to get a spot on the wknds.   The quality is better than most places and helps fuel my dim sum cravings when I have them.   My favs are the preserved duck congee, the chinese sausage steamed bun, and the lotus leaf wrapped with chicken and rice."}
{"text":"I went to a Chinese wedding banquet recently and it was at The Golden Palace Banquet Hall. The dinner was a 10 course meal. Some items were excellent, some were not that great, and some were so-so.   What I really liked was that the servers serve you your portion from the big platter, and they evenly distribute everything. As opposed to plopping the platter down and everyone serves themselves. In this latter scenario, the aggressive gluttons at the table get all the good stuff and the shy and meek ones end up just eating onions and garnishes. Thank you Golden Palace servers for making life a little more fair.   Since I have limited characters for this review and readers likely have limited attention spans, I'll just summarize what I had and my impressions.  1. Suckling pig and jelly fish. This pig needed to lift some weights because it was just skin and fat. Where's the meat? Skin was crispy and flavourful, I'll give it that much. Was my first time eating jelly fish. I found the texture strange, but not unpleasant. 2. Deep-fried minced shrimp around a crab claw covered in vermicelli bits. Fantastic! Crispy and flavourful. I could have eaten 10 of them. 3. Shrimps and scallops stir-fry. Delicious. Shrimps and scallops were big. Snap peas were crunchy and sweet. Loved this course. 4. Crab soup. Meh. Weird texture. 5. Abalone, shitake mushrooms and greens. This luxury is wasted on me. Abalone tastes to me like a fishy mushroom.  6. Some sort of bird, which I later discovered was squab (after posting the picture on Yelp, thanks Yelpy friends Karen K and Wei C for identifying the mystery fowl). Too gamey and fatty for my tastes. The worse course of the 10 in my opinion. 7. Some sort of steamed fish. Nothing to write home about. 8. Deep-fried lobster. Lobster anything is delicious in my books, so naturally I loved this.  9. Yeung Chow fried rice and noodles with straw mushrooms. Rice was a bit on the dry side. Noodles were good. I love straw mushrooms! 10. Mango pudding, some sort of pastry, and a dessert bean soup. Mango pudding was delicious. Full of real mango flavour. Pastry was too oily. Bean soup was acceptable.  There you go friends, my synopsis of the 10-course meal.   They are also famous for dim sum, which we had the morning after the wedding with the bride's parents. The dim sum was good. I liked the spinach dumplings with shrimp, the shrimp rice rolls and the BBQ pork buns. They don't push the carts around, you order from a menu.   The restaurant is in First Markham Place. There's lots of free parking."}
{"text":"First time here for dim sum, since the change of ownership, and I doubt I'd ever come back.  We arrived at around 12.30pm and there was around 8 other tables occupied.  The dim sum prices are on the high end side. From $3 for S going up to $7 for XXL.  But there was hardly anything that was S, and most things were classed as M ($4) and up. We ordered a variety of dim sum, cooked food and a tureen of salt bone congee.  Paying these prices, you have a higher expectation for the quality of the food.  It's either quality or quantity, but here you get neither.  The dim sum wasn't particularly great and we had broken bamboo steamers(a pet peeve of mine). The flavour is really lacking here with the cooked kitchen foods(the menu items available after 11am).  The congee wasn't very good either. The best thing we ordered was the Chui Chow steamed dumplings. They didn't look appetizing but tasted good, skin wasn't sticky and didn't contain peanuts.   The only plus is that the place isn't busy and it's easy to get a table. They also have an early bird special , where all S, M and L dimsum are priced at $3. I doubt that I'd return here because cheaper places have dimsum that is better than here."}
{"text":"I came here for dim sum over Mother's Day weekend and this place was \"quiet.\" Usually, dim sum places are waaaaay packed over the weekend, especially when its a holiday, but not this location. I walked in around 12:30pm and found probably close to a third of the restaurant empty--crazy!!! I thought it was the dim sum price but when I saw the menu, the pricing is comparable to other dim sum places so that couldn't be the reason why this place isn't popular.   After my dim sum lunch experience, I figured out why...  As starter, the service was pretty awful. I waved my hand like some crazy lady trying to catch a glimpse of a server and even when a server saw me, he/she went and did something else. My arm started giving way after waving so long that I got my mom to do the waving for me.   The tea that we were served was suuuuuupppppeeeeerrrr bitter---extremely over-steeped and this is coming from someone who likes their tea strong. I had to add A LOT of water to dilute the bitterness of the tea in my cup; by the end of the meal, I gave up on the tea and just drank water. I would say the issue lies with too much tea leaf in the tea pot; there is a saying: less is more...  Food-wise, the dishes were meeehh. The dim sum, noodles, and rice all tasted decent but nothing spectacular. I think the only dish I absolutely loved was the papaya with the coconut jello dessert; it was pretty unique and the cool texture was a great way to finish off the meal--this dish alone is the only reason why I am giving this place 2 stars.    Overall, service NEEDS to be more attentive, tea needs be less bitter, and dishes need to be more spectacular. My honest thoughts about this place... it looks like it may close sometime soon unless the owners do something about this place.   Would I return? Probably, when a new restaurant opens in this location."}
{"text":"Straight up and up front, I come here when I know all the other joints at First Markham Place will be too busy at peak hours.  That said, the dim sum here is pretty decent though on the expensive side.   Contrary to what other reviewers wrote, all our food orders arrived hot or satisfactorily warm. The shrimp ball on the eggplant tower dim sum was excellent (I don't remember the proper name). The bbq pork bun (red pork meat in a white bun) was also delicious. The only item that was so-so was their siu mai (shu mai aka pork dumpling ball).  Their \"ha cheurng\" (shrimp in rice roll) was very generous in the thickness of their rice roll part... and that's not a good thing.   In the winter, their automatic sliding front door allows lots of cold air to enter which makes a brisk dining experience.   Parking in this plaza is a nightmare. Be prepared to idle in an aisle to wait for a parking spot.  Overall, it's an OK place. I recommend coming here if you want dim sum and you're in the area. I wouldn't travel far for this resto."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. I've been here many times for dim sum and there's really nothing spectacular, so come here if you want a cheaper than average mediocre quality meal.  However, we came here for dinner tonight and the AC was not working (it was a hot day). Everyone in the place was sweating profusely including the workers (to be fair). What was most disappointing was nothing was done to cater the situation. Get some fans, give a bit of a discount...apologize for the situation. Nothing.  The only reason our family stayed was because we had our whole family there along with my grandmother and wished not to run around when it was already dinner time.  Just an unprofessional establishment."}
{"text":"Avoid this place.  Food was cold.  Servers were cold.  One of the managers on the floor was downright rude (tall guy with touch of grey hair). One of the managers was very nice (woman at the front).  Rice was really hard and cold.  Got it replaced with warm and hard rice... Peking duck was not crispy.  Beef dish was dry... only thing good was the duw mew (veggie).  So many things wrong with this restaurant... been here before years ago when it was still diamond and it was ok then, not sure if it is the new management.  There were 3 tables next to our table had dirty dishes on it when we got there and they weren't cleaned when we left.  Tea was hot though..."}
{"text":"Went here for dim sum today. Food was ok, a bit too salty and too much MSG compared to before. Waitress that gave us our bill at the end was rude. We gave them a tip and she made a comment that we should tip or give them minimum % or amount. She also said cash only (chinese lady in black suit with glasses). We found this to be very rude to demand a minimum amount of tip from customers even though it is a fact that many chinese & sushi restaurants don't even share tips with their workers, pay them cash (illegal) and owners keep all the tip. So why should we waste our $$ giving big tips so that they owners can keep all of it. We will not come back here again due this this experience and food is not as good as it used to be. Also this place have food & safety violation when the government audited this place last year and threaten to shut them down if they do not change their food handling practices. I would not have my wedding here or order a big table for dinner (10 course meal) here.  This place received a closure order last year in Aug 2017 for failing to provide adequate protection against the entrance of insects, vermin, or rodents.

{"text":"Some friends of mine were visiting from Florida and we had a craving for dim sum. Based on my previous four star review, Golden Palace seemed like a good choice, especially since we were shopping nearby.  Everything seemed to start out well. Our first few dishes showed up shortly after ordering. The portions were a decent size, with each item looking a little larger than most other dim sum places. Then came the wait...  We had finished everything on the table and more than half of our order hadn't been delivered yet. We waited patiently but nothing seemed to be happening.  Dishes started showing up again, one by one but there was no continuity. There was something different about these dishes, maybe a little unfinished. The steamed dishes could have been cooked a little longer, perhaps. The ribs weren't very tender.  After more than an hour and a half, with three dishes to go, we decided to cancel the rest of the order. We still had places to go. I enjoyed the food and service the last time I was here. Not this time."}
{"text":"Waited close to 25 min for a table for 4. Meanwhile 4 tables were abandoned and not clean up, everyone just starred at the dirty tables. Not very efficient. Staff running like chicken without heads. Totally understaff and not well managed. Nevertheless, when the food came, it was not disappointing - so much for a final happy ending and a very well-deserved two thumbs up; complimentary to the kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"Kung Hei Fat Choi!  Solid meal with entertainment today at this new restaurant that used to house one of our favourite restaurants. We were a group of 13 for New Years dim sum.  Food was good, with the usual dim sum favourites available. We got there at 930 and they would not let us order off the 11am menu until 11am. This was a bit disappointing as my kid has allergies and most dim sum places will let us order half chicken for her to nibble on.  They had a veggie stuffed tofu dish which I enjoyed very much. Also at 11am we ordered a deep fried tofu dish which was tasty. The beef rice noodle roll was too red for my liking.  They had live entertainment for New Years, three dragons dancing. They had heads of lettuce that you could get for your table centerpiece and you were expected to stuff them with lye-cee so that the dragons would come to your table and \"throw the cabbage\". The older kids and adults loved this.  Service was very slow, even though we were there before it got crowded. Empty plates piled up on the table. Lots of people working there spent a lot of time getting photos with the dragons."}
{"text":"Mediocre experience at best, maybe 1.5. Over half of the bowls/dishes for our table was dirty with stains, foods or hairs and needed to be replaced.  Food was sub-par. Our peking duck skin was not crispy. Goji Bak choi in soup tasted like it was blanched in water, not only tasteless but you can tell not a drop of oil was in the cooking process. (Very \"serk\" if you're Chinese) Beef tenderloin cubes were overly covered in garlic. Service was great for an Asian restaurant, so the whole night I tried to find things to l like about but there were no redeeming qualities about this place other than the service."}
{"text":"Downgrading this restaurant back to 1 star. Waited for about 20 mins for a seat on Sunday morning. When they said our table was ready, it was to a table with no chairs. We were standing next to the table for 10 mins and flagged numerous staff and mangers before 3 chairs were brought over. And one of the chopsticks was visibly dirty"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family as table of 12. When we got here, they hadn't set up the table although my grandparents and aunt had already sat down. They forced 12 of us to squish into an 8-10 person table. We asked for the menu to order some vegetarian dishes for my grandparents and they just gave us the set menu. All the staff gave us so much attitude when we wanted to order. Took 4 of them to put in our add on. A lot of our dishes were dirty with crusted food on bowls, plates and tea cups. They didn't even bother looking at them when they were distributing on the spot. When they found a bowl that was dirty, immediately rinsed it with the teapot on the table and poured the dirty water out in our bowls on the table  The food that came was almost all lukewarm and cooled down within 5 minutes. They weren't attentive to what we had or didn't at the table. We needed vinegar and pepper for soup but they didn't give us either. We asked for it and finished our soup in that time. They even gave us 2 forks for a plate of fried rice. The people bringing out the dishes also don't know what they're bringing out and tried to force a dish on us and pretended it was something else. We proceeded to wait over an hour and a half for one dish from our set meal to come out and asked for it over 6 times. Ended up cancelling one of the add ons. The service is worse than most Chinese restaurants.   Do not recommend this chaotic place with cold food, dirty dishes, worse than usual service."}
{"text":"Golden Palace feels like a transplant of those numerous low ends Chinese Restaurants from Scarborough.  The interior is really spacious and it was half empty on a weekday evening.  Portion is huge. Price is cheap. Food is mediocre. Most dish we ordered was a miss. ($20 for a Peking Duck was one of the special offerings)   A lot of other options in the area.   But I guess there are always customers looking for cheap mediocre food."}
{"text":"I came here here for dim sum with family. It just turned to a new management. At 12pm, it was packed with people and had a line up. We waited for 20mins.   The interior design stayed the same but the menu changed. We came here for dim sum but ended up ordering their set lunch combo menu. The food was pretty good for lunch.    The service was pretty good, just a minor mistake with our tea. The managers and supervisors were all very attentive and made sure things were running smoothly. The waiter took our tea pots to get refilled but didnt to come back with it because she forgot where our table was. We got our teapot after we reminded them and they apologized very politely.   I think it was a bit on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Thought this place was just ok. I don't think I'll be back. Food was just ok and service was lacking    Pork buns fell apart,  bland desserts, we had hair on our food.   I hated that we were a table of 10, so it was a large table, and there was no lazy Susan.  Not convenient.    I know service is not the best at dimsum places but this was ridiculous.  No one would make eye contact but hey no worries about attention when they know you are getting ready to leave. They hover to make sure you pay."}
