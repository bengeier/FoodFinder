{"text":"This review is mostly about the wine club that they offer. I don't think their wine picks are exceptionally good and the price per bottle didn't seem discounted. If I'm committing to buying wine every month I would expect to get a better deal. We used to live in wine country in Oregon and all of the wine clubs discounted the bottles that were included in the shipments. Also, they could offer memberships that were quarterly so that you can get nicer bottles instead of having to buy cheaper bottles monthly.  We have also been here for drinks a few times. I like that it is local and there is such a good selection of wines. There is a corking fee if you don't choose off of the menu (which is sad because they have such a huge and awesome selection that is not on the menu), and it seems a little high. The service seems hit or miss.  Would like to try the food but haven't yet."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere. It felt nice and cozy. I love having a local wine bar in Brecksville. The bar was not loud even on a Saturday night. We had a delicious flat bread, the ingredients tasted fresh. The service in my opinion was good they gave you space while still coming by to refill your beverage. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decor looks ok but layout is too busy. Difficult to walk, sit/talk, breathe. Food is...edible? Service is mostly underwhelming. I think for this price I would visit Creekside, Courtyard, or Burntwood instead next time."}
{"text":"Wife and I have driven past multiple times and decided to give 750ml a try. Bad decision.....interior was okay, kind of blahhhh. We walked in and looked around, no one acknowledged us, so we just sat at a table. A server came over and asked what we wanted to drink.....I asked to see a wine list first....really? I asked my wife. After an awkward 5 minutes we ordered. We decided to share a flatbread. Raw chicken! We told our waitress and she brought it back to the kitchen. We told her we didn't want it back and they still billed us for it.   To sum up our experience, we felt forgotten from the time we walked in to the non-existent thank you when we left.    Staff huddled in the corner chit chatting, customers waiting long times.   Better options in the area."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice, limited seating.  However they were completely unprepared for their opening.  Several times the servers passed us by.  We sat for over 15 minutes and were never acknowledged."}
{"text":"Went here recently. My husband and I both got flatbread pizzas. He got the chicken, red pepper flakes, and cheese. It was good, though not very spicy. I had the basic flatbread which included cheese, basil and soppressata, I thought it was pretty tasty.  For dessert we got the apple pie and ice cream, which I thought was delicious.  The wines are at state minimums, but there is a $10 corking fee per table. This isn't bad if you're with a group and get several bottles. But for us it made our $13.99 bottle $23.99. And, I thought it was silly to pay a corking fee when our wine had a screw top.  Our bottle of wine, flat breads and dessert came to $50."}
{"text":"Staff is pleasant and the wine is great! They also have some good happy hour deals. I've eaten here and have never been disappointed.  One time my friend and I were looking to purchase some wine, and the person helping us was extremely knowledgeable! Love this place and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Cute little date night spot. Very loud environment and your basically sitting at the table of the people next to you"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere of this place, and I definitely enjoyed my wine flight and bento box of snacks.  I was disappointed in the service, however.  The service was fine while we were seated at the table and ordering from the menu, but when we were perusing the wine selection looking for some gifts and bottles to take home, no one offered to help us.  We eventually gave up and went to Heinen's."}
{"text":"Some people believe you cannot fall in love just by looks but I sure did with this place. The ambiance here is great and the place is clean and crisp. I visited on a Wednesday night and it was very empty but that didn't stop my friend and I from having a great time. We never felt rushed to order or rushed to leave. They did not try to close early because the place was empty (this has happened to me at other places). My friend and I sat a table by the window and were able to chat for hours while drinking wine and enjoying great food! This place makes a good date night spot or a place to get together with a group of friends!  I started with a glass of the house sangria and it was not my favorite but is by no means bad. From there I asked the waiter to help me pick out a wine that was on the drier side but still had a hint of sweetness- he recommended the Bordeaux by the glass and it was wonderful! It was exactly what I was imagining. My friend ordered the Chardonnay and said it was exactly what she wanted- a summertime wine. You can pick a bottle off the shelves and drink it there (they do charge a $7 corkage fee) and you can take it home if you don't finish it.  They have a wonderful selection of bottles and wines by the glass to choose from and they are affordable options!  I know sometimes people who don't drink wine are deterred from wine bars but this wine bar also serves a great list of draft and bottled craft beers.   The food was also really good! We split the Avocado Toast (a summer special) and the White Hot flatbread pizza. The creamy Asiago cheese on the flatbread was soooooo good! Their menu is simple and delicious."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for a couple of years now. Finally stopped in last night. The service was excellent and the food was great. It is very cute inside with a romantic flair. They also have a little wine shop right next to the restaurant. I can't wait to go back when it's snowing outside, I think it will be beautiful."}
{"text":"Such a cute and intimate space for some delicious wine! Came here to meet a friend for drinks and dinner. They had a decent selection of wine by the glass. It was nice to see that they weren't all the traditional names. I was able to try some new wine and who doesn't love that? They definitely have a better selection of red wine. But I don't discriminate against red or white so I was happy with each. We both enjoyed some tasty flatbread. Delicious! They even had a mini summer menu selection! For dessert we had a chocolate fondue plate. We both agreed that the pound cake was the best! We would have had the whole plate be pound cake if we could have. I would have given 5 stars but the service was a bit spotty. Few times we would have an empty glass of wine, but our server Brody was very friendly which keeps it at a 4. We will definitely be back for more vino, flat bread and of course the pound cake! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy going there on a Friday or Saturday night for some wine and small plates, but lately the wine selection has been disappointing. Each time we found a new \"favorite\" wine, we were upset to find that the next time we went back it was no longer carried. This happened with probably 4 different bottles. My biggest complaint is with the wine club, though. I really loved the idea of it, and the perk of not having to pay a corkage fee on bottles drank in-house was great! However, the majority of the bottles I have received as part of the club are just garbage...literally...in that I have opened them up and immediately thrown them in the garbage. This just happened again tonight, so I will unfortunately be canceling my club membership as soon as possible."}
{"text":"For years I thought this was only a wine store until my sister stopped in and told me I had to go.  This is a nice little place.  I have stopped in now twice, once on a Saturday afternoon and once on a Tuesday evening.  Both times there were others there but nothing too crowded. I like that you can chose wine by the bottle, glass, flight or beer (bottled and draft). The food is tasty too.  I have enjoyed their artichoke Asiago dip, stuffed peppadews (medium heat), and buffalo chicken flatbread.  This is a nice relaxed place to hang out with friends with a glass of wine (or beer) and have a tasty snack."}
{"text":"Decent appetizers.  Confusing entry, park in the back and walk around to the front? What's with the constant techno music?"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a rare afternoon off so we decided to try this place. I had been here once before with my friend for drinks after work and enjoyed. We sat down and the waitress gave us the entire menu, no explanation or indication that the whole menu was not available. We were going to order some food (late lunch, about 2:30) and the waitress came back and said the kitchen was closed. Okay, no big deal, we'll have some wine and find a place to eat in the area afterward. The first page on the menu was their Happy Hour deals. The menu very clearly states Happy Hour, Monday through Friday until 7:50. Cute. The wines were $7.50 per glass. My husband and I both pointed to wines on the front cover of the menu (the \"Happy Hour\" menu). When I got the bill, we were charged full price for the wines. I asked the waitress and she said \"Oh, happy hour doesn't start until 4:00.\" Yet NO WHERE on the menu does it say that. In fact, the menu does not indicate any start time, only an end time. Not only that, but the waitress could clearly see that we were ordering from the Happy Hour menu (we did the dumb pointing at names thing). She should have mentioned at that time that the wines would be full price. Instead, she kind of laughed it off and said we probably should put 4:00 on there and I said you absolutely should. I will not be returning or recommending."}
{"text":"I was tooling around the Brecksville area on a recent afternoon and spotted 750 ml on a corner.  I wandered in to peruse the wine/beer selection but I ended up tasting a red wine flight.  What a great place to try ecclectic wines that aren't offered at other places!!!  I was warmly greeted by Frank and sat at one of six tables aligning a stainless steel bar.  Behind me was a wall of wine that I was able to wander through while tasting.    I ordered a red wine flight of Spanish tempranillo, a french bordeaux, a California red blend (sweet), and an Australian shiraz.  Frank placed them on a gorgeous wooden (pine?) server with hand-written descriptions so that I knew which I was tasting.  He presented them in order from dry to sweet so that the wines would be palatable.  I have to mention the fact that they don't serve food until 4:00 pm.  I was happy with the fact that I walked in the front door and wasn't overwhelmed with the fragrance of food.  This is the PERFECT atmosphere in which to taste wine!  Our next stop will be 750ml in Fairlawn!"}
{"text":"I meet a friend at this 750ml location in Brecksville quite often. This last time we grabbed a drink here I was very pleasantly surprised with the level of service we received. Our server was very easy to talk to and even let us know we were both choosing a great drink.   This place is a little pricy but the atmosphere is great. Can be difficult to get in on a Friday or Saturday night due to the limited amount of seating. Great place to meet a friend but not the best option for larger groups."}
{"text":"This place is so charming! I went with my husband and we both loved the simple clean decor and romantic lighting. The wine and food were both delicious. Our server was very attentive, friendly, and helpful. I also found it to be very affordable, with a range of wine prices and the option to enjoy some affordable appetizers if you don't want to spend money on a full meal. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great wine selection, funky conversational seating upstairs.  Nice find in the suburbs for a girls or date night."}
{"text":"Cute place. Decent selection of wine. Sadly it ends there. There is a $7.50 uncorking fee if you purchase a bottle & choose to drink it there. They tell you they will seal it up for you. Unfortunately the server put the cork from my $55 wine into a bottle of $16 wine, put in a paper bag & stapled it shut around the cork. He said this was fine & would not be considered an open container??? I wish I would have opened the bag. Called the manager when I got home. Not the nicest of guys. He's sorry, will talk to the waiter, &  if I come back & mention his name he will \"send something my way\". Since they did not seal up the bottle & gave me the wrong bottle he should be crediting my card back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful wine bar. I had one of the wine flight and got to sample a few different wines. I even discovered a red that I finally enjoy while I was here. The server was very knowledgeable and help guide me to a new fun wine tasting experience. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Recommended      (for a social glass of wine)  The atmosphere on a cozy rainy day really kicked this place up a star. It would be great for night time also. I would probably not go in here on a sunny day.  The lighting is great, retro-style Edison bulbs give everything a warm glow. It's cozy and romantic.    Atmosphere: aside from my comments above, I was VERY disappointed in the television blaring a hockey game in my face behind the bar. I get the tv, but it would be so cool if they played old black and white movies or something that matches the atmosphere.  It was kind of an eyesore and detracted from the warm intimacy of the place. Nobody even was watching it   Food: ok. Menu could definitely be improved though. We got stuffed peppadews and a cheese plate. They have gluten free crackers for $3. I attached a pic of the menu - mostly flatbread (no gluten free) prices were average for a wine bar.  Wine: GREAT selection for such a little place. They had Orin Swift, and a bunch of other great wines.  The wines were $7-$15 per glass and they had a chateau neufdepap (spelled way wrong) for $17. You can buy a bottle and they cork it for $7.50.  Service: friendly, not rushing us out at all"}
{"text":"LOVE this wine bar! I've been here twice now and both times really enjoyed it. Huge wine selection. You can either order a glass or bottle off the menu or you can buy one of the bottles they have for sale. The food here is also amazing. Both times I've gotten the cheese tray and flat breads and split them with my friends. Highly recommend the prosciutto and fig flat bread. Only downside is this place gets a little loud when it's crowded because it's so small."}
{"text":"Such a cute place. Small inside but flatbread pizzas and wine selection is really good. Staff there is very friendly and treats everybody well. Enjoy going there!"}
{"text":"l love this place!  Great wine and delicious light fare.  The service could be a little more attentive.  There is a nice mix of crowd that changes throughout the night.  But beware, the seats on the chairs at the bar are VERY slippery even before the wine!"}
{"text":"Four of us recently met here.  We arrived and were greeted, after a while, by someone who we thought was another customer.....   Maybe he was, we were seated but it took Maybe 10 to 15 minutes to get acknowledged by our server. The place was busy, but only because the layout is ...challenging.  The tables are uncomfortably located.  There are grape vines on the walls....dead ones.  I get there is some planned artistry here, but it just doesn't work. There are huge sofas and tables, uncomfortable located.   We had a few different flatbreads.  ....all were good.   We had an olive plate.   Good as well.   We had flights of wine, they change every day I think.   They were good.   So. To summarize:   -  food- good,  -  wine-good,  -  service- not good,  -  atmosphere- I felt uncomfortable  -  price - a bit pricey for me."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Our server, Amy, was wonderful and the manager, Pete is quite a character and really made sure everyone felt at home. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Wife and I went to 750ml for the first time on Friday.  We were with a large group of 8.  Here are my thoughts.   Downstairs was tight as other Yelpers mentioned.  To me no big deal as they are doing what they can with the space they have.  Wine selection was actually pretty good and prices seemed in line.   We went upstairs and it was nice. They really need a few chairs opposite the bench seats though.  The decor in general was nice.  The wait staff did a nice job for us.  They ran out of wine glasses so it took a bit of time to get our drink on but once we got going they were very attentive. One other nit pic issue is that I feel the Reds were served way too warm.  I'm also thinking what happened is the glasses were washed and dried and were hot when they were poured into.   Almost forgot, the food was very good.  Especially the mushroom flatbread and the bruschetta.  We will return for sure."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Food wasn't that great either.  What bugged me the most is my wife and I were sitting at the end of the bar where apparently the servers like to congregate when they have nothing to do.  The guy sitting next to us was an off duty server and had his laptop and everyone kept coming over and hanging out with him.  It's just off-putting to have to sit next to a bunch of servers BSing instead of working.  Couldn't even hear our own conversation."}
{"text":"Great little wine bar in Brecksville. The bottle selection is WAY better than the by-the-glass selection. We were here for happy hour and they had a few glasses  for $5. Service is good. Tried the Seven Falls Cab on his suggestion and it was great!   Trust your wine staff, folks!"}
{"text":"We had the Tuscan flatbread which was good - but could have been a bit hotter - it was only semi-warm.  The staff needs customer service training. They are still not sure what to do, or when to do it.  The bartender gave us our menu, we figured out what we wanted, then she said, \"Oh you can't order that - you have the wrong menu\". The atmosphere could be warmer. It is very modern, stiff and sterile. The metal chairs were not comfortable - they looked like prison seating."}
{"text":"thought the decor was really nice and intimate upstairs. food was surprisingly tasty. and wines were great.   only downfall was the waitress not really knowing her stuff inside out, but whatever."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this wine bar is rated so poorly. The service has always been great, there's good food, reasonable prices with varying specials in flights or pints, and obviously a great selection of wine. As for the decor, it resembles the exact feel of California's small tasting rooms. What a treat in NEO!!"}
{"text":"Was in there several times the people are rude.  The food was marginal at best.  When the food came out and was not cooked thoroughly I asked for the manger Frank came out was rude and said the food is usually good but I must be picky.   The owner happened to be there and she was not nice as well.  I feel my money spends anywhere and it won't be spent at 750ml."}
{"text":"I highly enjoyed the wine flight that I ordered. They have a very large selection of wines at very good prices.  My friend and I ordered the Sriracha Hummus to start and it was just okay. It was pretty much just your typical plain hummus with Sriracha squirted on top. But, I am a HUGE olive fan and the olives that came with the hummus were to die for!   We also shared the White Hot flatbread and similar to the hummus, it was nothing special. Asiago spread as the sauce with grilled chicken, cheese and red pepper flakes...  My takeaway? Go here to drink...eat elsewhere!"}
