{"text":"This is a nice grocery store in the middle of the city the prices seem tired but it seemed as though everything was on sale when I went during the weekend and I actually live in the suburbs and your other decently priced grocery store so I was very much impressed to say the least. They had some great Christmas things that were on sale downstairs and they actually had quite a bit of selection. No I know it's not ideal but for someone living in downtown specially attached to the grocery store it was probably a lifesaver and they had a decent amount of selection"}
{"text":"It's great having a small supermarket nearby.  It's convenient to buy dry goods but the produce is not very good at all.  I bought a package of mushrooms but when I opened it at home the mushrooms were moldy.  The checkout is awkward and the young staff is not very helpful. Kensington Market is so much better for fresh produce but when the weather is horrible, it would be good if City Market were a better alternative."}
{"text":"This is a great FULL grocery store. They have EVERYTHING. They really, really need grocery carts though. It's hard to do a big shop with just a little basket."}
{"text":"DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY This company is terrible and the owner constantly lies straight to your face. She lied to me about wages, past employees and schedule flexibility. The first day working here seemed like it would be amazing. all the managers seemed great, i got a tour around there store and my manager at the time was really friendly. after 2 weeks I realized it was all a facade.  I told them I couldn't work Saturdays in my interviews because i had a Saturday class, and they seemed okay with that but then they schedule me on a Saturday 2 weeks after, i told them in advanced i wont be able to make it. On Saturday I didn't come and i got in a lot of trouble for it and then was used against me when i asked for my raise a month later when i was supposed to get a raise after 2 weeks after showing my skills in the meat department. Also i got food poisoning early on and missed a day, as i understand how that impression works, there was nothing i could do and i got yelled at by my manager for it  the shift after and he mocked me for being sick. It was ridiculous. The owner is a terrible lady and i am so glad i'm no longer helping her make money.  Back to the manager. the manager quit thankfully before i quit but when he was working for independent city market, everything was so much worse. He had anger issues and would come to work throwing things around and yelling at people over small things. Half the time he was doing this because of his own mistakes, i called him out on it and his hypocritical ways of going about things. Which i heard many bad things about him from the other employees and didn't believe at first. His attitude was that of a child and when we argued and i told him what he does to his staff is not okay is reply as his reply to many other issues i had with him was \"i am the manager, i can do what ever the fuck i want\" this was extremely appalling to me. In addition, this \"meat manager\" did not know how to cut meat well or generally just didn't know what he was doing.  This company is terrible, the owner Carmen and the manager Steve were the worst i've ever experienced.  If for some reason you want to work for this company, work for produce. The manager who works at 301 college is a great guy and really cares for his employees and his a hard worker."}
