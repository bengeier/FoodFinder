{"text":"Just had breakfast at the Inn this morning - the lemon ricotta pancakes are awesome!  Will be downloading the recipe for sure.  Also had some great conversation out on the patio - what a beautiful place."}

Here's some of my personal tasting notes for Chefs Table March 12:

Octopus, prosciutto, eggplant puree, artichoke hearts and Chardonnay...remarkable! ***

Pickled Spring Vegetables: Beet, cucumber, carrot, cauliflower, kohlrabi on a bed of goat cheese /w goat foam on top
- each veg marinated in a different brine: beets in sherry, kohlrabi in apple and kombu, carrots in orange and vinegar, cucumber in dill, cauliflower in white wine
- amazing!!!! ****

Chardonnay; (Vin d'orge?) from South Africa **
/w gnocchi with roasted hazelnuts
- wine tastes sweeter /w gnocchi, but wine brings out the hazelnut flavour in the gnocchi.
- enjoyable ***

St Francis, Sonoma County, 2006 (Cab Sav) - buttery, full bodied red / w a little spice (pepper) in the finish
/w beef tenderloin, with pomme Anna, madjool dates, 'green puree', Easter Island radishes (yum!), and lavender to garnish...mmm, I'm in Heaven...the lavender adds to the unique taste of this dish.

{"text":"A great place to eat - very high end.  If you stay at the Kensington Riverside Inn, you get 15% off your bill and breakfast up to $20; if you're a member of the Hillhurst Sunnyside Coommunity Centre, you can get 10% of your bill.  Breakfasts are great  - mostly a variety of egg dishes plus a choice of coffee  or tea.  Dinners are great - usually there is a choice of risotto of some kind.  The waiters are very nice and give you plenty of high quality bread.  Everything on the menu looks and tastes great, and it's fun watching the chefs work.  Definitely a nice option for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Chef's Table is one of Calgary's best fine dining experiences.  
Service is knowledgeable, attentive, friendly and efficient.
Food is wondrous...try the seven-course tasting menus if you're ready for a sumptuous culinary adventure.
Wines are fantastic...matched with great precision to the dishes.
Decor is beautiful, upscale but approachable.
Chef's Table is an intimate 40-seat restaurant located in the charming 19-room boutique hotel -- Kensington Riverside Inn.  Ideal for romantic escapes or a celebratory occasion.  Patio dining in the summer.  Just heard they also have a weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Food was cold and disgusting. Rude staff. Driver of van also cut me off on the way there."}
{"text":"Went for brunch for the first time today at Chef's Table. It was a snowy day in Calgary so the restaurant wasn't too busy. Their brunch menu is very simple and has about 8 main entree items and each of them $18 each. A bit on the pricey side, but the food was very fresh and tasty. We ordered the croque madame, eggs benedict, and we couldn't resist to order the lemon ricotta pancakes to share, which ended up being the highlight of the meal! The pancakes were cooked perfectly (a little crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside), and the lemon flavor was light and refreshing. We also both ordered a refill on our lattes and we were pleased to find out they didn't charge for the second cup. Our service was great as the waitress was very attentive and made sure we always had what we needed. Would definitely go back for those pancakes and try out their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"No ordinary office park lunch spot.  THIS deserves your attention as it is run by a chef - cooking up a storm.  Hot specials, great sandwiches and consistently standout food. Great combinations - unusual wonderful tastes. If you are doing business in the area.  COME EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Now open for brunch, so I booked a reservation for 4 on a Sunday at 11am.

A very nice setting in the Kensington Riverside Inn,  I had the impression it was called the Kensington Arms hotel.  Not sure where I got that idea.  Anyway, the restaurant is somewhat small, appropriate for the size of hotel.   There are about 6-8 tables, white table clothes, silver, signature settings, open view to the chef/kitchen.   

Greeted by nice server who took our coats and seated us, then went off to prepare our coffees.   I ordered a double espresso macchiato confidently as she seemed to know her stuff, which she truly did as my espresso was excellent.   There was only one server, but there was certainly no lack of service.

The chef's special was a chorizo omelette with cheddar and peppers, that seemed fine with me, and it was.  Others had eggs benedict, and other omelettes which everyone found agreeable.  There were only a couple of other tables occupied even though it was 11 am (prime brunch time).  The bill was no more expensive than any other decent brunch.

Very relaxed and pleasant ambience.  I hope no one else finds out about this, as it is really really hard finding decent brunch places in this town.

I can't say  what anything other than brunch would be like, but I expect that it would be top drawer.

Every time anyone asks me where to stay in Calgary, I always recommend this place.  To date, not a single person has taken my advice on it.  Their loss, as the location cannot be beat.  It seems the perfect hotel to me."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. The kale salad was super yummy. I had a vegetarian polenta dish that was really good. Very nice dining room that is not too large."}
{"text":"Great little spot in a nondescript office strip. The ambiance is not much but the friendly staff and the attention to good food and value is amazing. I always settle for their daily specials and never go wrong. The best kept secret in the local area. Make sure you tell your co-workers about it."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Kensington Inn for a work trip and when my clients found out I was staying there, they all said I should try Chef's Table. Thankfully, this restaurant is the same restaurant that provides room service, so at the end of a long and cold day in Calgary, ordering from here, eating in the comfort of my room was just bliss. The menu changes every so often. I ordered the heirloom squash ravioli (you could really taste how handmade the ravioli skin was), the chestnut soup (so hearty), and foie gras appetizer (melt in your mouth, though I wish there was some sort of carb paired with it). For breakfast, you have to try their lemon ricotta pancakes. So FLUFFY and to DIE for."}
{"text":"This place is really good for a cafe attached to an office building. They use fresh ingredients, no MSG and are halal. I went there on Friday and had the tilapia which came with some tasty vegetables and potatoes. I also ordered the lentil soup. The soup was amazing! My only compliant is that the fish had a little too much salt. They are a small place with a regular sandwich / wrap / soup and cafe menu plus they have something different each day of the week like the fish on Fridays. For a quick sit down meal they are very convenient especially if you work in the building. To-go is also an option. Wish I'd tried them sooner as I was in town on business for just that one week."}
{"text":"I've only been here once with my husband - because we stayed at the Kensington riverside inn for our wedding night in 2013, but I can say that the food was fantastic!!!
The staff were amazing, and we were very impressed, would recommend"}
{"text":"Just went there for the first time on my lunch break, it's just a little hole in the wall but the food is awesome! I got a jerk chicken sandwich with a garlic and vegetable root soup. All of the ingredients were so fresh and the ACE multigrain bread they use is just stellar. Will be going there from now on!"}
