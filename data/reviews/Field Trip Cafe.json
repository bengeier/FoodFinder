{"text":"We dropped by Field trip one lazy afternoon. From the February cold, we suddenly found ourselves in almost-spring: the blue accent wall, the large windows, the funky plants and smiley staff all played part in the magic. We got a coffee (guatemala), a hot chocolate and a muffin each: an apple-cinnamon and a chocolate-cherry. The drinks we got were so-so (I'd rather had a starbucks), but the mmmmuffins... were heavenly! Warm, fresh, full of taste... pure satisfaction!  Will be back just for those."}
{"text":"Field trip is a quiet cafe that is good to work or read outside of your home/office. The chairs they have remind me of my grade school chairs, but bigger - adult size - which is a bit nostalgic. 

I've tried a couple of their baked goods and they're not bad. Both times I had a muffin and didn't think it was moist enough. Their chocolate chip cookie was tasty though. 

The reason I keep coming back is for their mocha and patio. Even though Bloor St is just a couple steps away, you don't really feel the busyness of it (or maybe I'm just too zoned into my work to notice). Their mocha is super delicious and I'm not sure why because it's just chocolate, espresso and milk at the end of the day. 

There is WiFi which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't based on my experience."}
{"text":"Came here while wondering in this part of town. The coffee is good and what one would expect from a nice cafe next to a park such as this. 

They have a bar, a patio, nice staff. The interior had a clean modern look with minimal decor. 

There is an abandoned building across the street with graffiti across it that gives this place a 'totally legit'/ 'bad ass' vibe. If your into that sort of thing. Although judging by the elderly out of town couple inside, it's a pretty tame neighbourhood.  

There are sandwiches made fresh daily, judging by the loaf of bread half sliced on a cutting board on the counter, it's a 'from scratch', 'onsite' type situation. 

On the whole seems like a great place to waste away an afternoon or start a laid back Friday night."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem! I love their patio, it's a pretty good size and Dave's an off street just off of bloor west of ossington. It's lovely on a nice summer evening... I liked their beers they had on tap and what a deal too! Also, great options for nibblys w a coffee or drink. Very friendly, charming owner he knows a lot of the stuff he sells and takes the time to let you know what tou may like. Definitely worth checking  out when in this neck of the woods... It's a little bit hidden but that just makes it that much more of a gem!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop. It has the fuel you need to get as much Toronto as you can physically handle!"}
{"text":"This is the best coffee shop in the hood amazing owners and staff  I am a chef in the downtown area and look forward to grabbing a coffee on my way home after work.     5 stars"}
{"text":"This review is for the food only. I didn't try any coffee. The food was very mediocre, not terrible, just pretty bland and uninteresting. Also fairly expensive considering this fact. We had two different wraps, two different types of the empanadas, and a almond-based dessert. The dessert was the best part but also nothing special.

It seems like it could be a decent place if you just want a coffee and place to work."}
{"text":"This is a vegan-friendly cafe in the space that used to be El Cafecito. I really love the patio on this space. It's removed from Bloor and quiet. Interior is small but beautiful.

They have vegan muffins, a vegan sandwich special (red pepper and hummus) and you can get jam on toast made from freshly baked bread or just buy a whole load here.

They also have quite a few beers available for when coffee won't do. 

Extra points for the name. Owners are super friendly."}
{"text":"This place really just has it all. Great food, awesome service, huge patio, reasonable prices, craft beer. I'm happy to have stumbled upon this local gem."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and coffee. Well made, good ingredients, tasty food. Good vibe and decor, nice big patio. 5 stars for great value to $ spent."}
{"text":"Field Trip Cafe is a neighborhood gem, set back from Bloor making it a really nice, quieter spot compared to other cafes in the area. It's my go-to spot for grabbing a quick, healthy bite. They have amazing wraps, baked goods (that they make fresh on site) and vegetarian options. Always friendly service and a great patio! They are always busy and clearly work so hard to make the cafe what it is. I am thankful to have them around. Hope they continue to do well!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to cafe on sunny days - they have a great patio which gets lots of sunshine in the afternoon! I find their wifi is hit or miss. The past three visits I haven't been able to get online from the patio. Maybe the signal doesn't reach outside. Would give them 5 stars if their wifi was more reliable!"}
{"text":"So many good things to say about this place. Great service, yummy/healthy breakfast and lunch, well sourced and thought out coffee, and unpretentious atmosphere. It's a great place to work as well, especially with the patio in the summer. Hope they never leave."}
{"text":"Lovely little place feels cozy and bright!
My friend got a strong, full-bodied coffee and I got a nice big helping of honeydew tea. Tasty.

Other points:
- Has long tables for big groups of people, was able to fit my group of 8 people
- Cute decor! The big red airplane and plants make the place feel serene 
- The high ceilings make the room feel spacious 
- The colour scheme of turquoise, off-white, and wood really bring the space together

The place would have been quiet but my group of friends was quite chatty lol."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this place on Friday because I heard it's a good place to work. BlogTO doesn't fail and they were right. Nice long tables, bright space, noise level is kept to a minimum, and friendly service. I was very surprised at the noise level, everyone was just quietly working. The place wasn't that full around Friday 10 am so I was able to grab a seat after I ordered coffee. I didn't need plugs so I didn't look for a table with one.

Despite the nice ambience, I found their beans acidic for my taste. I ordered a flat white and it was acidic and there wasn't enough milk for my preference. I like the work space so next time, I'll just order another drink and not a flat white."}
{"text":"Field Trip is a small cafe in BloorCourt.  I try to avoid using the bathroom here, as it's a small space that's not super accessible.  I don't know if they're gendered since I never use them.  The cafe itself is super great; it's accessible in the sense that you can order a drink in a mobility device and get out or get seating, but I can't speak to the facilities, my bad.They offer water in a jug, which is a big plus to me.

They have vegan, veg, and licensed beverages and food.  A cappucino with almond milk is $3.75, which is VERY reasonably priced.  And the service is always amazing!  

The big selling point for me is the beautiful patio that's open in the summer.  I LOVE the patio.  But this space is beautiful so it gets full."}
{"text":"I went there with the work team and had our meating there on Wed afternoon. I really Like it. 
their berry-choco muffins are dynamite!

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Go-to cafe if you're in the Dovercourt village! The owners are incredibly attentive and always have a great idea/product to share. The cafe has an amazing decor, cute plants and sunny terrace. It's the perfect spot to go study/read and have a beer or a coffee.

Great beer selection, and the snacks they sell are locally made. You should go!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great friendly staff that are not in your face either. Baked goods and sandwiches are great, but most importantly the coffee is tops.  

Great job on a great place !"}
{"text":"Licensed coffee shop.  

I prefer drip coffee to Americano's and Field Trip makes the best drip coffee around.   They are very particular about where they source their beans from and give you a choice of three beans.   What is exceptionally helpful is that they have accurate definitions, earthy, spicy etc, of each bean and are happy to tell you more about what to expect from taste. 

As others have mentioned, the west facing patio is fantastic to grab a drink on during the summer.  They have a couple of craft brews on tap and a limited bar rail, although this is definitely more a coffee shop than a bar. 

They do offer some pretty awesome pre-made sandwiches which are delivered daily and the type of backed goods one would expect, muffins, scones etc.  

An important thing to be aware of is that each cup of coffee is made fresh via French press at point of order.    I love this conceptually but it does impact the ability to get in and out quickly.   I am not sure how they have figured it out, but it takes approx 4 minutes.   When I French press at home it takes 10. 

I love that they take the time to brew with integrity but it certainly has stopped me from stopping in on certain occasions when I have been in a rush.    I have tried calling in advance to place an order but they don't actually have a landline.  

The staff is approachable and friendly, although there is one guy who looks at you sideways if you don't tip, which as a result, I never do if he is the person serving me. 

The latter two paragraphs are the reason this get a 4 rather than a 5."}
{"text":"Just popped in here for a latte and muffin and I was impressed! My chocolate chip banana gluten-free muffin was very good and so was my latte. I also really enjoyed how bright this cafe is and all the greenery along the wall. There's also ample seating for anyone looking to get work done."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe off Bloor Street. My friend wanted to meet for coffee here since she tried it when she had her coffee passport. The decor is nice and relaxing and despite having a few customers around, it was pretty quiet and a nice spot to do some work, read a book or have conversations with friends. 

I had a vanilla latte and empanadas in the morning. The empanadas were okay - I especially enjoyed the sweet potato and kale. The espresso in my latte was great. 

I'll definitely be back if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Decent selection of food and bevies. They have a great patio for enjoying the sun in the afternoon."}
{"text":"came here on a Monday afternoon to grab a tea and get work done! they have a great outdoor patio, and a lot of seats inside. great selection of food and drinks and the wifi is fast."}
{"text":"Cute place, good coffee and tea, great craft beer selection. My go-to coffee spot in the area is The Common on Bloor, but I was hungry today so stopped here for a sandwich. The sandwich was yummy (grilled veg with hummus) and the Prairie Boy bread they use is great (also available as toast with butter or jam). The coffee costs a bit more than at The Common, but is still reasonably priced ($3.25 for a cappuccino). Plus they have beer and a patio. I didn't have any of the pastries, but they looked good - several types of cookies, muffins and tarts were on offer. Would love to see some plants or flowers on the patio just to make it prettier, but on the whole it has a nice atmosphere. 

Update: I tried one of the drip coffees (ground and brewed to order) and it was excellent. I urge you to try one instead of an Americano."}
{"text":"BEST CAPPUCCINO I'VE HAD in Toronto so far! I was in the area and popped in here to do some work. I ordered the cappuccino and an oat cookie. The capp was absolutely delicious, you could actually TASTE the coffee. The milk:coffee ratio was exactly right. The cookie was also super tasty and by the description, it's a healthier alternative. They also have gluten free options. Big plus: the price is great! The atmosphere is awesome as well. The decor is simple and cozy and the wifi works perfectly. I ended up staying almost 3 hours working and felt super comfortable. Recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for a quiet Sunday afternoon of reading or working. Beautiful west-facing patio for sunny afternoon drinks. My favourites are the smoked turkey sandwich, fruit and seed bar, and the flourless brownie. The handsome Joe is an iced coffee with simple syrup and sparkling water. It sounds weird, but it's actually delightfully refreshing. Also they have good beer and fast wifi."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars ... better than average dirty chai latte and decent cookie.

Just off of Bloor St. is a really cute and calm cafe.  It has a great large patio with many tables and it's really kept clean.  Lots of big tables where you can drink coffee and work.  It is a nice relaxing space.  They also have a lot of different craft beers and drinks for your to enjoy.

We came here because we wanted a bit of a caffeine kick and something sweet.  I wouldn't necessarily come here for something sweet.  Though they do have a few baked goods (muffins and cookies) and they're quite generous in size, they're decent and may not get your sugar itch.  Just a few doors down you have Bakerbots.

As for the service and drinks, I was pleasantly surprised on the large variety of craft beers and ciders here.  It would be awesome to enjoy a can of your preferred drink on the patio.  Service here was chill and quick... not much of a talker but definitely works quick to deliver our chai latte.

Chai Latte - An authentic tea latte... this isn't your typical premix from a box.  It has a gingery note to it.  It is a touch bitter so add some of the simple syrup that is found at the cart.  I found it pretty good. I did appreciate how they had almond milk. 3.5/5

Pecan Chocolate Chip - It is a large large cookie that is quite soft.  It isn't overly sweet and it's a pretty decent cookie. 3/5

Overall, cute spot if you're looking to chill and relax in the sun on a nice patio."}
{"text":"Cute area and a really nice outdoor seating area. Pretty basic drink menu but still great tasting. My only complaint would be that the wifi isn't great if you are going there to work."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed coming here.  Service, flat white and chorizo empanada was delicious!  I nice large patio to sit and work/read was great!

They also serve Beau's 
Atmosphere was very comfortable!"}
{"text":"Things I love about Field Trip cafe:

+ The americanos.
+ The colour scheme. The turquoise wall which matches the custom stamps on the takeout coffee cups always makes me happy. 
+ The playlists. The Strokes, Courtney Barnett, Kurt Vile. Sometimes the Owen Pallet stresses me out when I'm sitting working on a deadline. But sometimes its weirdly motivating. 
+ The weird couch in the basement by the bathrooms.
+ There is often a cute dog patiently waiting out front for its owner to buy their coffee.
+ The soup. Made in house and tastes like it. Warm and nourishing and helps with productivity more than the cookie I think I want but will just cause a sugar crash.

Things I don't love about Field Trip cafe: 
+ The broken ATM machine in the basement by the bathrooms. I have never needed to use it, but its been broken forever. Why is it even there? The cafe takes debit, so the ATM machine is confusing.
+ They are often out of baked goods by the time I get there. I usually go in the afternoon so I get it, but I don't have to like it. They have started stocking other food options like grain bowls though. So don't worry you won't go hungry if you roll in at 3 p.m."}
{"text":"Got an amazing Iced dirty chai. Some places give me grief about this drink but it's my new test to see if I like a place cuz it's my go to drink. It was awesome great chill music to have some beers on the patio or to putter away on your laptop. Super cute. Awesome vibe. I want to be a regular !!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer since the former cafe, El Cafecito.
- Very spacious, great patio
- Serves both cafe menus and drinks (as well as snacks)
- Fairly priced coffee
- Nice tea selection
- Good vibes
- Multiple outlets (IMPORTANT)
All of these were making it a great cafe for someone who often works remotely. 

But, for the last couple months, their WiFi has been really weak, to the point I can't continue working. I first thought it may be because the cafe was busy, but nope, I went back when there were only 5 customers--still very weak. It's a shame but I won't return till their WiFi issue is fixed... :( It's still a good cafe for meeting up with friends, reading, etc. though."}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop tucked away on Westmoreland, just north of Bloor. 

Good coffee, decent prices, tasty sandwiches and cookies, and friendly staff - what more could you ask for? Oh, and they don't charge you extra for non-dairy milk! 

They also serve beer and have a nice selection of bourbon, which is a bonus. 

The place is sometimes full with people working away on computers, but it's also a nice place to go and chat with friends. When it's nice out, there is also a lovely patio."}
{"text":"This is great escape to get some studying done. The coffee is delicious and the service is friendly. 
My only complaint is that it is so busy and the muffins are never yummy. Go for the cookies instead. Also, if studying gets too much, you can have a beer! 
I can't wait for the outdoor space to open."}
