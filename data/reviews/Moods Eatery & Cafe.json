{"text":"Last visit our group literally walked out after being treated like shit by management. Though on good note; found a new shisha place called al-omda. And It's beyond great! 

As for moods:
Hint: customer is always wrong here. 
The wait time is at least 25-45 mins so be ready to wait in line for a good while. 

The food flavour is very tasteless. So eat somewhere else ahead. Actually desert choices are awful too. So have a look at cheesecake selection from Mediterranean place next to this. 

The shisha flavour are mostly weak unless you get double apple or mix berries. 

Oh and management is epitome of awfulness. 
Have been here 4 -5 times and had just about enough with their quirky awful management."}
{"text":"Moods Eatery is simply fun, different, and apparently authentically Halal .The combination of quantity (Huge portions) and festive atmosphere is very amusing ,  the meats are quite good. Specially the Steak and burgers were very good, the pasta and chicken also exceptionally good -- but it's really a meat place! And once you find things you like, you can pile your plate high. They also provided complimentary appetizers & sometimes fresh juice drinks (excellent) and mashed potatoes.
Dessert, in the highly unlikely event you have room, is an extra delight and the selections is very nice.Â 
If you're a fresh coffee lover you're definitely at the right place , amazingly fresh espresso !!"}
{"text":"I came for a birthday dinner party with about 15 people on Sat. night from 8:30-11 p.m. and we spent a good amount of money between shisha, dinner, and dessert. I am diabetic so I cannot drink any of their sugary unhealthy drinks on their menu so I asked for tap water to go with my dinner and the waitress said that it was the owner's policy not to serve tap water which is a basic human right. Instead, she offered me toxic plastic bottled water. I was apalled that in an expensive area like Oakville, would be so cheap that they can't even offer their customers tap water when they are spending good money for shisha, dinner, and dessert. The owner is nothing but money hungry who doesn't care if his reputation is tarnished to make $2 off 1 bottled water. He should be ashamed of himself."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheese burger was good, the fries are good too and of course thoer sheesha is great, we played dominos (thier dominos have few missing pieces so make sure to check them before playing)"}
{"text":"First of all, the hours on their website aren't accurate.  It says it is open at 4:30pm but went on a Wednesday and it wasn't open until 5:30pm.  The hours on Yelp are probably more accurate but it has been over a week and the website hasn't been updated even though I told them it said they opened at 4:30pm. 

Went with a friend last week and we got there before they opened so we had a choice of seats.  The pricing on the drinks are crazy.  Too much for juice, pop, milkshake, etc.  Not market pricing, it is like they are trying to make extraordinary profits on the drinks.  And, their food price isn't \"cheap\" either.  I had a chicken wrap (tandoori wrap I think it was called).  It was okay but not really worth the price.  It was overspiced (the spice overwhelmed the dish) and even though they say unlimited refill on the fries not sure why the portion of fries was so small to start.

My friend had a garden salad with added chicken.  The salad had shredded lettuce, it didn't look that great but he said it was okay.

The service was friendly but I really didn't like that when I asked for a glass of tap water the answer was \"we do bottled water here\".  Eventually the waitress agreed to bring me out a glass of water but the attitude about the water really turned me off.  I am sure she was told by her boss/manager to try to sell bottled water but that is nuts.

Personally, I won't be going back.  The place seemed popular.  Maybe it is the halal aspect that brings people in but if you don't need/want to eat halal there are better options (even Monforte next door, which itself has gone downhill since the early years, is much better food/value in my books)."}
{"text":"Waited over 10 mins for a table. The waiter and presumably the manager made eye contact many times yet did not come over. When I tried to get over to talk to them, they walked off. Terrible."}
{"text":"Good food, awesome ambience and great customer service. There's ample seating and Moods creates a wonderful atmosphere to sit down and have dinner. I came with my family of 5 we tried the burgers, chicken caprese sandwich, and penne. The burgers and sandwiches are the best. Definitely worth a visit. Also they have endless fries :o"}
{"text":"Good food, good ambiance and good service;  Philly steak sandwich was ok; but the classic beaf burger was  exceptional;  one of the best burgers I have had in years , a true classic . The lemon mint drink was most refreshing.  Lots of variety and choices in the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food!  I had the butter chicken and it was incredible. Very kind service and the look of the place is very trendy!! I'd recommend this place to anyone who enjoys south asian dinning and hookahs"}
{"text":"Possibly one of the best hangouts in oakville. Great service in a great relaxed place. The food is also outstanding.  The manager is always there to cater to the customers every need.  Wow place"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best shisha and eatery place around that knew how to combine both  in a nice and practical way.
I was impressed with the trendy rustic and cozy lay out and setting. The service is nice but need more training , the door receiving was very welcoming and that was nice.
menu is short and divers, appetizers ( need to improve on presentation and recipe )main courses were ok in taste and need little improvement on presentation. Prices are descent, specially the shisha.
over all I believe that they are working hard for improvement , an ok place to go to for a shisha and dinner.
Wish them all the best."}
{"text":"Shisha is on point and fairly priced.  Haven't tried much of the food but what I had was good. Prices for food and drink are on the expensive side."}
{"text":"One of the best Shisha places I've been to. The place is very bright and spacious unlike any other shisha cafe I've been to before. However the service is absolutely hopeless, we waited for half an hour for a cup of tea, also we asked a waitress whether the shisha tobacco's were herbal or not. She had no idea, so I asked if she can double check and get back to us. Naturally she didn't care and forgot all about it."}
{"text":"They use the worst charcoal for shisha, they use the shisha charcoal brand 3 Kings, which changes the taste of the shisha, they should be using the natural charcoal or Golden river instead which is much better."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I have been to,  Excels in all areas,  Interior is unique,  upscale and inviting.  Service is very good,  respectable and prompt,  menu choices are sufficient and balanced. 

Food: we ordered a pulled beef sandwich,  that came with skin on fries,  Carribean Fire burger,  mini burger kids combo,  Lemon mint drink,  and Caramel cream for dessert.  It was the best meal I have had for a long time,  and I must admit that it was the best burger I have had,  period.  

I highly rate and recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just got back from this place. There is no doubt that its a nice clean place and everything but when it comes to food it loses its charm. The cheese stuffed jalapenos were 95% cheese and batter with less than 5% real pepper. The tex mex burger was big but filled with cold salsa which totally took the essence of the burger away when mixed with hot beef patty and who puts beans in salsa? I mean what are they thinking when they are giving you this tex mex burger? Just putting a piece of avacado and a little of your own non authentic in house salsa makes it a tex mex? Utterly disappointed with that."}
{"text":"To sum it up concisely, this place spent to much money initially and had to cut down, in my next couple visits from the first one I found that the number of servers decreased and that lead to service being slow as well but food was still delicious. But since my last visit, they converted to a hookah lounge and now the food is also garbage. So essentially the two stars are for the hookah (which is $12.95 and I have yet to try)  and the environment because they lost everything else about their identity."}
{"text":"Over 15 mins to get seated in a nearly empty restaurant. Another 20 mins for the server to take the order and another 30 mins after that to get the burgers. They had only 1 server for such a large place.

The tex mex burger had beans instead of a tomato salsa as listed on the menu. As someone else noted, the menu is now half of what was originally listed on the website. 

Dont waste your time or money.."}
{"text":"this is a popular sheehsa spot especially between middle eastern, being someone that does not smoke  sheehsa I'm not the best to review a shisha spot, but due to the fact i go there so many times a week cuz of my friends sheehsa lovers, I can say service is great, mint tea is good, oreo milkshake is great, and their wraps are very good.

I have tried all their wraps, and I can say my favorite is chicken Parmesan, very flavorful , and the steak and onions sandwich, they are soo flavorful, and the fries are good and comes with a variety of sauces, i usually just get the chipotle cuz its my favorite.

their carrot juice is actually fresh, and their brownie with ice cream is great. heard their burgers are not the best, so I will keep going for their wraps. 

They have cards and backgammon and their service is great. Samantha is always on top of things and Omar is great as well. 
4 stars simply because the owner raised the prices and now its a little higher than average comparing to other shesha spots"}
{"text":"Nice roomy place with good lighting and a very nice theme.

The shisha flavors could be better. 
Service is on slow and disorganized side.
Overpriced items on menu."}
{"text":"After a nice dinner my friends and I wanted some coffee and shisha and dessert so we went to moods it was quite busy but we got very fast a table near the entrance so we ordered coffee and shisha and brownie with ice. The coffee was good the shisha too we wanted to share a dessert me and my friends so after the brownie arrived we started to eat and I notice there are walnuts inside one of my friends is severe allergic to walnuts so I called the waiter and asked for the menu so there where no nuts listed on the menu. So I called one of the waitress and asked why didn't they wrote it down on the menu and guess what her answer was : i didn't create the menu(rude voice) and then she left.sothere was this other waitress we called her and she apologized and told us it's not nice of the other lady to say that. So thank god i notice the walnuts else my friend would have a severe allergic emergency food is and shisha is nice but the service is 0stars"}
{"text":"Love this place, service is fast , shisha is perfect specially grape mint , food their chicken tikka wrap very yummy . Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"1) The manager has no people skills and comes off as very pushy and rude towards customers (I.e. raising his voice).
2) The place is definitely understaffed - waiters and waitresses attend to your table twice in a usual 45 minute sitting - once to take your order and once to deliver your bill - no sense of restaurant courtesy of attending to you in between (I.e. top off your empty glass of water,  checking if you want to order anything else, renewing your coal for your hookah, etc...)."}
{"text":"I went yesterday, it was nice but when I pay i found $6 Tap Water, and I asked the server she told me yes we charge for tap water :(
Disaster"}
{"text":"Nice ambience! Nothing too fussy! Very accommodating! Huge space! Great exhaust system! Very patient staff! And good to see the owner there most of the time taking care of customers"}
{"text":"Bar food genre.  the food is horrible. chefs needs to go to cooking school.

ambiance is nice clean. the staff very cordial. 

Recommendations : not a place to visit if you are a bonified foode"}
{"text":"best place. Amazing service . Treated us with respect and service on point. Best place to go in the oakville region.."}
{"text":"We came by tonight to moods, It's a newbie shisha place like few month old. They have various options of panini sandwiched and wraps, appetizers and few main courses. 

The place sounds spacious and cosy, there was a tremendous amount of tables. Once I arrived, my friends told me the shisha tooks more than 45 minutes to be up. I ordered orange mint and it was out of order, I switched to peach mint and it was fresh and smoky enough. It's more pricey than other shisha places. 


The place is fresh, vibrant, and clean. I felt a downsized service though but I'll keep coming back as it's the most modern shisha Cafe I have been to in GTA area."}
{"text":"One of the most unique decors in an Oakville restaurant. A bit of a Keg/Moxies hybrid. Have to say, was a bit skeptical at first. We've seen many restaurants fail over the last decade in the same location. When we first sat, we were served the wrong drinks, and the food took a bit to come out. When it did come out it was fantastic. I had a beef bacon burger which was one of the best burgers I've had in my life. Reminded me of Apache Burger in Toronto - great bun, perfect cook, seasoning, hand prepared patty. Fries were fresh cut, also some of the best I've had. Even the gravy was amazing. My girlfriend had a burger with pineapple relish, and also said it was perfect.

After we had capuchinos, and were given a creme brule on the house! Both were great, and of similar quality to those I've had at Jonathans Fine Dining in Oakville. Really rooting for this place, such a tough location."}
{"text":"I honestly dont know how this place is not 5 stars. Best shisha spot in Canada. I have been to over 60-70 shisha spots this is by far the best one. They use the best shishas, hoses, charcoals, and heads. Thats rare to find. Great music and environment. Pleasant food and service. Its worth the drive and will always go there if i get the chance."}
{"text":"Basically got asked to leave because the place got busy on a Friday at 10pm (shocking). We ordered drinks, meals, and hookahs and were still asked, rudely to leave. I'm repulsed at the fact that they treat paying customers like that. Just overall terrible customer service from the manager."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice atmosphere, and friendly staff. Great shisha and an authentic experience. We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Moods Cafe? More like DESTROYER of MOODs cafe!

\"A beginners guide to D*CK business practices\"
I read all the negative reviews about this place and the owner but I ignored it and trusted the place as the experience i was having was not bad.
HOWEVER, that changed this Saturday night when i decided to bring my family and a guest who was visiting Toronto for the first time.

We were 5 people and got seated, we ordered 2 sheeshas, couple of coffees and a dessert menu item. Pretty normal right? NOPE!

They have this policy that the minimum order per person has to be 15 BUCKS! like how is that possible unless you are eating dinner in the place or every person is having his own Sheesha?

The whole concept of sheesha is you smoke it around with light snacks or a drink and you are pretty much making it impossible for people to do it. Not to mention the highly infated prices for food and desserts
A slice of bakery cheescake for 9 bucks?
A s**ty creme brule for 12? is this a Micheline star restaurant?

Like who do you think you guys are man?

So our server says she can't take our order because its less than whatever bucks and she will have to call the manager, I talked to the manager and she said the same thing that it's a policy and BS and she doesn't agree with it(making a fake sad face) but that's how the owner decided to run the place. I said ask the owner to come talk to us, then she LIED that the owner is not at the restaurant.

I know you Mr. OWNER, i saw you at the restaurant, you are too chicken to come talk to your paying customer coz of your inflated ego.

This has to be the single most worst experience i have had at a place, and I have had plenty of bad experiences.

We left the place and went to al-omda lounge(amazing discovery)

I will make it a personal point to let all my friends at oakville know to avoid your place and find an alternative, which is not that hard. Business like these, need to die."}
{"text":"They say opening time is 5:30pm, i came and waited until 6:10pm and they were still close."}
{"text":"I would give them - 100 if I could  sht place 

It's the worst place to be .I don't recommend people to come over and the waiters unfriendly with guess. The food not good and shisha  tasteless  l actually they don't know how to make shisha I believe my little brother 9 years old can make better shisha them those workers at mood I have situation with my friends my friends were sitting in place for an hour and after I came there I'm about to sit down the waiter came over and asked us to change the table because this table is reserved for other people."}
{"text":"I visited moods today for the first time.  
Let me say that I am really satisfied with everything. 
I ordered Caesar salad,  mozzarella cheese sticks and Swiss burger with poutine. Food was fresh and tasty 
Shisha was good 
Servers kept on checking on us and made sure everything is okay. 
The place has a nice country style from the inside and the location is easy to find.  
Definitely coming back.  
Shout out to Nohad,  Shareef and Megan for the service."}
{"text":"Wow. I've never experienced such HORRENDOUS service. The moment we walked in we were ignored by 6 employees and when asked to be seated they looked at us as if were a hassle. 

Once seated and orders were taken I  asked for the most basic thing... water with lemon and a sharing plate for food. 
The waitress dumps a lemon slice into my fries... then when I asked politely for the extra plate she says yes right away, rolls her eyes and literally turns her back to us and goes to clean the five tables next to us and nope... doesn't bring it.... still waiting on it. Lol"}
{"text":"The food was over priced and burnt. Service was slow and not very knowledgeable.  The first and last time I will eat there."}
{"text":"This place confuses me. So basically it's a dusty shisha place (based off the clientele) mixed with an upscale restaurant vibe. Just really weird and confusing. Like it's kinda a chill hangout spot where you can just pull up with sweatpants and smoke but it's like they think they're a bougie restaurant at the same time???? They're really not upscale, it's hella dusty and medium class. Like no one's dressed nice and the atmosphere is kinda whack and doesn't have dimmed lights or like the waiters are not wearing professional type clothes like in most upscale restaurants so I really think they're trying to be something they can't be. 

Omg, and the menu prices. What. The. Hell. $1.50 for tap water??? Omg lol, their prices are like an upscale restaurant $18-$25 per meal but they can't even match it in terms other stuff. For example which CHEAP AS* restaurant charges for tap water??? Noooo honey, if you want to be \"bougie\" you should know that upscale restaurants don't charge for tap water, how cheap can you get LOL. It's just so funny how confusing this place is, either you're bougie entirely or not. Like just stay in your lane, you're really not upscale. 

Anyways, shisha was good. Overpriced but whatever. My soup was really good. Oreo milkshake was pretty trash. Didn't look like the picture, my friend who ordered it was disappointed. 

Waitress service was meh, but I don't expect much from shisha places, but it was just so weird because once again they were trying to portray some high class vibe but it really wasn't lmaooo. She literally paid us no attention lol, had to walk up to the front to pay.

Anyways, I MIGHT go back.. not sure tbh. Was a pretty weird environment but the food was good."}
