{"text":"Two attempts both epic fails.  This restaurant is very amateur.  The staff have not tried many of the items on the menu (our first hadn't tried anything and the second had only tried the burger) so they come off as unhelpful and unknowledgeable.  The hostesses let us seat ourselves both times while they followed us around, they had also run out of menus (here's a hint, print one for every chair in the restaurant and then print another 50% for spares . . . just a thought!).  On both visits our food was taken to the wrong table . . . not once but for each course.  No lie, appies, mains and desserts delivered to the wrong table.  The staff clearly don't know the table numbers which should be basic knowledge.  The manager circled quickly on our second visit to see how we were doing, we barely got one word out of our mouth before she moved on.  We attempted to provide feedback upon our exit but she snapped in response and walked away in a hurry.   There was an odd dance floor set up too.  Not sure if it's a Stampede thing but it was odd.  Is this a restaurant or a family wedding hall (read: kids - grandparents dancing).  

The food is mediocre at best.  All of our meals (on both occasions) arrived luke warm.  One of the plates was so hot the server had to use her shirt sleeves to carry it (another amateur move) yet the food on the plate was not hot.  

We're really disappointed.  We were so excited to have a restaurant within closer walking distance than Kensington.   Now that we've tried twice we unfortunately won't return.  The extra 8 minute walk to Kensington is absolutely worth the far superior service and food at any of the restaurants there.

Some things that might help improve the experience in the future:
1)  Train your staff - bring them all in and give them samples of every menu item.  That's basic Restaurant 101.  They should know the menu inside and out and also know the table numbers the food is going to.  
2)  Serve hot food and provide napkins to staff to carry plates that are hot so they don't need to use their shirt sleeves.
3)  Find your identity - are you a restaurant or dance hall?  Either is fine but you can't really be both.  People (especially those sans Children might not want to be subjected to the family dance off complete with the added squeal!).
4)  Get a wifi booster for your patio so people can pay at their table. 
5)  You're located in a Legion that offers membership which provides a discount at the restaurant - your staff should know something about the membership.  When we asked the \"Manager\" about membership she tossed a card at us and told us to come back another time, stating she was 'just the restaurant manager'.  Here's a tip - obtain some knowledge of the surrounding business and don't huff off when people try to engage you.  Your attitude alone is reason for us not to return."}
{"text":"We have been here about a dozen times and the food and service is always excellent. This evening i was dining alone, and I was tired, hungry and cold when I arrived.  I was warmly welcomed, and seated at a good table (not too near a large group nor hidden in a corner). My waiter, noticing that I was cold, immediately brought me a mug of hot water to warm me. He recommended the evening's \"special\" , a bacon wrapped meat loaf which was delicious served with mashed potatoes, peas, and a good gravy. It was an excellent choice. Great comfort food! This is such a good place for a casual meal in a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Met a friend for lunch. We can early and really had our choice of seating. We chose to sit on the patio on the west side in the shade. We both had the Turkey Sandwich. I has the green salad on the side and she had the fries. All were delicious! We had the Panna Cotta for dessert and were not disappointed. By the time we finished our lunch, the place became busy, although there were plenty of seats.

Perhaps areas for improvement are more parking. There are only a few spaces in the new building's lot and most folks seem to park in the old parking lot and walk over. Not really a problem now, but will be if and when the old one is torn down and made into condos.

They might want to clearly mark the entrance. During our lunch, we noticed several people attempting to enter from the opposite side of the building and were confused on how to get in. An easy fix would be a sign on the proper door.

So far, the menu seemed rather small, but that might be a good thing. Maybe they are just offering a few things and do them well.

Overall, I'd return with friends."}
{"text":"I went with my son, daughter-in-law and twin 3 year old grandsons for a Saturday brunch.  Everything was great, from the care and consideration of the waitress to the quality of the food.  We had a wonderful time.  It great to have a facility of this caliber in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently.  Happy to support the legion.  Found the menu to be a little bit limited, and the server knowledge was lacking.  Meals were good, but they need to brush up on a few things."}
{"text":"Love the decor and feel of this restaurant. Like a modern upscale pub. They are pretty new and still working through the kinks that all newbies need to get through. Servers are still a bit confused about table numbers and are learning the menu. The manager seemed to be highly involved. 

We enjoyed our experience here as all food was solid and very flavourful. Cocktails were good and at $10 who can complain? Lol. We shared the house hot wings and loved the intense flavour and spice, although I think it was too much heat for the normal palate so they might need to tone it down a notch for the rest of the population. The wings were covered a green sauce and served with house made buttermilk ranch which was delicious. Lamb linguine was my favourite and full of flavour. Tender braised shredded lamb swirled in perfectly cooked noodles and zesty tomato sauce. The burger was pretty good and those house fries that they come with are the bomb (herb parmesan and crispy). 

Would return to 1918 for sure. The menu is limited but I think that will change over time too."}
{"text":"Hmmm, will try the members only area next time. Interesting visit. My wife was given a dirty cup for her coffee. The burgers had a very pungent tomato type sauce that smelled like compost and grabbed at your taste buds.  The server did try very hard and that was appreciated.  I may go back at some time for a second try.

Tried the members area, I don't know what this place is anymore.  Looks like a board room with a bar at one end. No one was in there.  They closed at 6:00 pm on a week night. I think they open at 3:00 pm.  What's the deal?  Why are they open at all?
Is there some secret area I missed?  Maybe there is a different members area with big screens and pool tables etc.  Very disappointed with the direction you went.  Unfortunately you will lose all your regular members.  Again I don't believe that this legion did this to their membership.

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Beautiful sunlight with all the windows.  Had the pork schnitzel very tender and tasty. For desert the baked Alaska mini was recommended by our waitress, great choice. Was with friends so made with good food and good friends very nice night out."}
{"text":"Second time going:
Ok, went back again and now totally turned off, unfortunately. Had to update my review because it was completely opposite. We got there right at the beginning of the Sunday brunch rush and the staff were a scattered because they totally weren't prepared for a rush. I ordered the same meal as last time, the salmon eggs benny. Last time it was on a homemade biscuit and was delicious. This time it was on an English muffin and was meh. Our kids got the kids Farm. One egg \"any style\" + bacon and has browns, with a kids pop. We asked if they could get something else to drink and we're told it doesn't come with a drink. Huh? We left it because our kids were fine with water anyway. Then we ordered one of their eggs fried and one boiled. The waiter said they couldn't do a fried egg ... HUH? But over easy was an option ... isn't that the same thing? Maybe not but come on. Then we were told a boiled egg was also not in the system but he could do two eggs over easy. Seriously??  The waiter was nice but come on man! Figure this stuff out. Oh and the background music was terrible. The acoustics are bad in there anyway because it's all glass windows for walls on one side, big open space and super high ceilings but the speakers were cracking on the bass. It was like when you have speakers hooked up to iTunes and don't adjust the equalizer - how do people not notice that. It sounds terrible. Won't be back for a while until they get some more kinks worked out. It's too bad because we live super close.

First review:
We went here for brunch a few weeks back. During stampede week actually. The staff were still working on switching up seating arrangements inside but we sat out on the patio. The staff were awesome, very attentive to our two little kids, 5 and 2. Had brunch. Both of us had eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and it was delicious, with loads of hollandaise sauce. I don't remember what the kids had but I'm pretty sure we ended up taking some home since the portions were really good.  Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I liked the place walking in and left wishing I went to a different restaurant. 

The ambiance and use of lights were nice, the local beers were good, and the sustainable, organic menu was appreciated. 

We tried the Cracklins (pork rinds) first. Though heavy handed on the salt, I really enjoyed the flavors they used for the seasoning. Goes great with a pint of beer.

We opted to have our appetizer before our meal, but we didn't expect to wait an hour for our food to come. I tried to be patient about it until I started to notice patrons who arrived later than us receiving their food and watching our waitress keep her interactions with our table short. 

Our food arrived. I ordered the pappardelle (noodles with pork shoulder, cabbage, etc) and he ordered the house burger with fries. 

I did not enjoy my dish at all, I had a hard time eating it. Pappardelle is made to handle heavy sauces since they're thick noodles and I typically enjoy pork shoulder, but there wasn't much sauce, there wasn't much flavor and the noodles were dry because of lack of sauce, and the pork shoulder pieces were dry and overdone. I couldn't finish my meal and preferred not to take it home. 

He enjoyed his dish more, described it as tasting almost pizza like because of the toppings inside but overall thought there was not enough seasoning for the meal. There were tons of fries, which were just ok.

It's one thing to have to wait a long time for your food, but it's another to wait a long time for a dish that wasn't worth eating. It's even worse when staff notice and avoid your table. 

As a first time visitor to Canada and as the first restaurant I tried, this was a bad experience I wish I  avoided. If anything, the local beer is good."}
{"text":"So close! The restaurant located in the new Royal Canadian Legion building is modern and gorgeous. The menu is fresh and the food delicious and fairly priced. It was a hot summer day and I enjoyed my meal until the server Cayley threw some shade. Perhaps it was innocent and if this is your first job I apologize. It is irritating and borderline disrespectful when strangers, specifically younger than you, refer to you as, \"Sweetie,\" \"Honey\" or other cute pet name. So close to a 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"We *really* wanted to like this place, as we live just a few blocks away. It would be great to have another good restaurant option within easy walking distance of our house. Unfortunately, we just had brunch here, and it was really disappointing.

We ordered two dishes: the Pork Benedict and the French toast. Both were mediocre. 

The pork in the Pork Benedict was dry and flavourless. There wasn't much Hollandaise sauce. One of the poached eggs was very runny (which is just fine with me), but the other had been cooked to a medium-boiled consistency -- the yolk had fully set. We must not have been the only people who got inconsistently-cooked eggs: as we were finishing a server brought us a plate of eggs cooked over easy. Apparently they were meant for a different table that had complained about their eggs.

The French toast was also flavourless. I want to write a longer description, but what more is there to say about food that has no taste? The \"orange blossom cream\" on the side was nice, I guess.

I'm one of those people who reflexively eats everything on their plate, but neither my wife or I bothered finishing our (admittedly large) dishes. They weren't *bad* -- they were just profoundly bland.

We want to like this place so much that we're going to come back for dinner on another night to see if we just came at a bad time. But as it stands, I see no reason to ever come here instead of Dairy Lane three blocks down the road."}
{"text":"This is not your grandfather's Legion club. In June 2017 the old Kensington Legion -- one of the largest legion clubs in Canada -- moved into a new building directly next to it's old home near the corner of Kensington Road & 19th Street NW.  The new location features a restaurant open to the public: the 1918 Tap & Table. Unlike most Legions, there is no membership requirement to visit the downstairs space. (Note: There is also private Legions club on the second floor featuring an outdoor balcony, bar and live music on weekends. However, this club will also be open to non-members for the next several months!). The 1918 focuses on modern pub grub. We had a fantastic burger with seasoned fries served with a garlic aoili dipping sauce and salad. The couple next to us were trying some of the other plates that also looked amazing, like lamb with pasta. The bar focuses on locally-brewed beers from several Calgary breweries including Toolshed and Big Rock Brewery. The staff are very knowledgable on beers and the food. The atmosphere downstairs is a mix of ages from 18 to 80. There is also an outdoor patio for nice weather. The decor is what I would describe as recycled modern. It's a beautiful space with big sunny windows and bright light, literally night and day compared to the old legion that resembled a dark school cafeteria.  I had two minor complaints: 1) the bartenders could be more attentive to empty glasses; I had to raise my hand and wave to get attention several times. 2) Compared to a typical Legion where you can get a whole meal for $6-$10 bucks, the prices here are expensive but on par with Calgary gastropub prices. That said, it's now the closest pub to our home so we'll be back! Again and again!

Full disclaimer: my wife and I are both veterans of the *US* Army, but members of US and Canadian armed forces are eligible to join the Legion, and the membership is reciprocal to Legion clubs on both sides of the border."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place but was very disappointed. Ordered house made chips to start. Massive portion of ok chips and nice dip. Had the beef stroganoff but found it flavourless. Pasta was ok but a bit too el dente for me. A bit of salt and pepper and a beefier flavour would have been welcome. Husband had shepherds pie. He said it was ok but didn't like the chips on top instead of mashed potatoes. Neither meal was particularly hot. Cocktails were good and servers were very good.   Only two salsa on the menu - Cesar with kale and the other two had arugula and since I don't like kale or arugula I passed. Menu is small so should be well prepared and flavoured.  Was a Sunday evening and they had been closed from 2 pm to 5 pm so there was only 1 other customer when we arrived.  Filled up gradually while we were there. Limited parking and not well marked entrance.  Patio is facing Kensington road so is a bit noisy.  
Overall really disappointed so will not return."}
