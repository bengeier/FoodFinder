{"text":"I met a friend here a couple months ago and got the Chicken Pad See Ew and it was ok, the sauce was kind of odd.  The service was fantastic, though, really nice and very attentive. My friend got the Chicken Pad Thai, a classic, and she hardly touched it. Something about an issue with that sauce.

I'm definitely going back, if for nothing else than the Thai Tea, but I'll have to try other dishes, even though it seems like these are the big two Thai food dishes that you'd hope would taste kind of standard and fresh at any Thai restaurant.  

Just enough space for power chairs/wheelchairs, but not very roomy at all."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by this restaurant last month after eating at the restaurant next door several times and wondering about this place. We've know been there twice and it is my new favorite Thai restaurant.

The place is cozy and have unique salt and pepper shakers on each table which is a nice touch. The service has always been prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable. 

Our first time at the restaurant, we both had Pad Thai with fried tofu from the lunch menu. It came with salad with the most incredible peanut dressing. I literally could have just eaten the salad and been happy! Yum!! The meal also comes with a spring roll... all for $6.95! The Pad Thai was very good and it was some of the best Tofu I've had, but the portions were so generous that I only managed to eat half of my food. Not complaining! This is great. 

The second visit, I selected the Mango Basil with chicken lunch special. I also ordered the house specialty drink, Thai Tea. Both were fabulous!! I never would have guessed that mango and basil went together, but it was amazing. I forget what my friend selected the second time around, but she also enjoyed her meal.

I've never been to Thai Patio for dinner, but you simply can't beat their lunch menu and pricing. 

If you like Thai food and live in the East Valley, try this place out. I can't wait to go again! Just writing this review is making me crave it."}
{"text":"Ordered the green curry to satisfy a craving and I think the curry paste was forgotten--little flavor, quite bland and underwhelming.  Will try again in a few months to see if this was an isolated thing.  Otherwise, staff and service were excellent, restaurant was clean and inviting."}
{"text":"great restaurant.  lunch special well worth the price and food is fresh and tasty.  This review will probably be filtered though as this restaurant didnt pay their advertising money to yelp."}
{"text":"We have been regulars (winter visitors) since this place opened and have found it to be satisfactory on all levels.  Unfortunately, the Pad Thai is not what it used to be.  We found it to be quite different this year from last year...and not in a good way.  But everything else that we've had in several recent visits has been excellent, and the service is superb, premises is clean.  I'm glad to see they continue to do a good amount of business, both seated and take-out, and look forward to dining here when we're back next fall."}
{"text":"The people at Thai patio are humans and I understand sometimes they have bad days. The place just seems to be one of those places that is very profit driven. I ordered a bow of soup and noticed there was little liquid in there so I asked the server. He looked at me as if I was lying. I showed it to the owner after a long debate and she understood it but sort made me feel very disgusted afterwards. For another spoon of liquid, I felt like I was facing a court trial. I can no longer eat there afterwards as I felt like the negative sentiment came directly from the female owner or manager."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant so much!  All the food is so fresh and delicious!  My husband and I like to split the red curry and either the Heaven Ginger (which is fantastic) or the Spicy Mint or Spicy Basil. Their curry dishes aren't overly rich like some places can be, but it's still nice to balance the sweetness of the coconut milk with a bright and crisp dish.  Their Tom Yum is excellent as well and doesn't skimp on the veggies!  The lunch combo is a great way to go and is the perfect amount of food.  The staff is always friendly and attentive.  This is easily my favorite place for Thai food."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I've been coming here since they opened and have always been satisfied. The food is amazing and the staff is always friendly. I highly recommend the Red River Garlic or any of the curry dishes. The owners are always there and are very friendly. If your in the mood for some good Thai, this is the place I go. The lunch specials are the best value."}
{"text":"Awesome! I absolutely love the curry catfish dish so much that I find it difficult to venture further into the menu, but if it's anything like the catfish, its sure to be a hit."}
{"text":"I have been to Thai Patio half a dozen times now.  I am always pleased with the food.  I like food extremely hot and they were happy to add additional spice beyond what people usually order for me the last couple of times.  Also I enjoy the many healthy choices available on the menu.

The service is always great.  Everyone is always extremely friendly and right on top of things.  I could ask for nothing more."}
{"text":"Love the food and the family that owns and runs it are awesome. Great lunch or dinner.

{"text":"My favorite Thai spot. Not as spicy as other places but that's just fine by me. Their service is phenomenal. One time they were serving cake \"just because\" and gave me a slice with my pick-up order. Little touches like that make me love them. Their food is fresh and flavorful and the noodles are never soggy on my pad see ew. I just wish they served coconut rice and then it would be perfect!!! (I've asked them a couple times, too!)"}
{"text":"Good food, with lot's of vegetables. They are very good about making custom orders too. For the most part the staff has been great, with the exception of one guy that worked there being kind of rude. Worlds better than Panda across the street, and similar prices especially for the lunch specials. Not the best, but far from the worst. They are quick to serve the order, but from watching the open kitchen at the bar, which I like seeing, it is easy to see that main dishes are usually made when ordered. Good corner spot to compete with Panda"}
{"text":"I have lunch here once a week. Good food and great owners. Lunch time on Fridays can end up standing room only."}
{"text":"Wow the flavor!
We had Pad Thai 
Orange chicken
And  Sweet and sour pork lunch specials and crab puff it was all so good lots of veggies!
The soup and salad were amazing loved the dressing!
YUMMY EGGROLLS

Good service too :)
I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"I'm hooked on the Drunken Noodles! Ordered them with chicken this time, and some Red Curry with shrimp. The BBQ chicken is always a hit, so I got that too. For a casual place they're quick with service and make the effort to treat their customers right."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try out this place for a long time, but never managed to get here until one of our girls chose it for her birthday. I ordered one of my faves... MUSSAMAN CURRY - Thai hot +. Turns out to be an excellent choice. All the kids loved their food too. Our server was sweet and attentive as well. Wait time was reasonable considering there were 15 of us. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"BIG news for East Valley Thai Lovers! The daughter the famed Thai Basil (Phoenix location) proprietor is all grown up and has opened up her own shop. Let me tell you, the apple does not fall far from the tree - she is on a solid path to out-do her Dad's culinary greatness in no time. Besides that, Thai Patio is an overdue and  sure to be welcomed surprise to Thai deprived north east Mesa dwellers. 

I went in for lunch with a group of co-workers today and each of us fell instantly in love. The amazing smells that greet you when you walk through the door are enough to make you want to come back, but the food itself is just epic. One member of our group (I won't name names) actually could not resist finger licking the remaining green curry remnants off his plate. Thai Patio is just that good. Can't wait for the work week to come around again so I can go back and try another of their super yum (and super affordable - $6.95) lunch specials! Yay!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a solid choice for Thai. I really enjoy their fried roti and curry appetizer. Many times that is my main dish!"}
{"text":"Thai Patio is fantastic. I usually have to get my lunch to go instead of dining in. The lunch portion sizes are big, and I don't know WHAT the white salad dressing is, but it is THE BEST! 
Their food tastes like home cooking. The best!"}
{"text":"Service was good, the owner was very friendly. They were good with our 5 and 7 year old. Brought us lots of etra dishes for the kids to share our food, which amazingly, they ate some of.
I think the wife ordered the 7a (it's been two weeks and I couldn't pronounce it then) which we both enjoyed immensely.  
Price? Great! Glad to see the lunch pricing apply on Sunday...till 2 or 3. Very fair. I suppose the portion size was typical lunch- in line with the price. No doggy bag was necessary.
We gave it a five for what it is. A Thai Patio. Good food at a good price with clean dishes and friendly service. We found our new spot."}
{"text":"Authentic. Delicious. Chicken Satay very close to Malaysian counerpart.

The outdoor patio is the best place to enjoy when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"My second visit to Thai Patio.

Opted to eat \"in\" (although they also offer take-out...and you see a steady stream of people picking up) and found the servers to be very attentive and friendly.

Got the Pad Prik Khing with chicken, and an egg roll (for a buck...but you have to ask for that price/portion) and soft drink.

I've gotten so used to no one ever making food \"hot\" enough for me...so I ordered it \"extra hot\".  (They offer mild, medium, hot and extra hot)

It was blistering...so next time I'll try just \"hot\".  :)  

I'm glad to find a place that isn't afraid to make it SCORTCHING HOT!

Anyway...the entree portion was generous, and everything tasted fresh.  The rice is moist and you get a good serving of it.

The egg-roll tasted fine...but was un-needed because the entree would've been enough.

My servers kept my soft-drink full...and I never once had to ask for a refill.

The dining area is pretty small...although they do have a large patio with seating.  Maybe when it cools off I'll try that.  

Everything was clean...and well looked after.

It is a bit expensive IMO...I left $15.00 which included a good tip...so for me that means Thai Patio will have to be an occasional splurge.

Anyway...over-all I had a good experience."}
{"text":"A friend referred me to this place. Really liked the food, service could improve a bit... Waiting for just a water or a soda should not take more than five minutes when it is slow, and please write down my order, don't pretend you'll remember it all...*sigh* Anyhow, grumpiness aside- When they tell you the food will be HOT, don't expect it to be mild. This has real thai spiciness all around. Great use of curry and sweet chili sauces. The use of sweet & spicy is my favorite combination. Mango with a spicy sauce. Interesting twist. Spring rolls were hot and fresh. Wonton was good. I really like this place, just want better service next time."}
{"text":"Manny (the chef) is the reason my family and I enjoy this restaurant, but he was out during our last visit. The set of silverware I got was dirty, and so was the replacement spoon- gross. I asked for plasticware and didn't even get a \"sorry\". 4 people came in before us and got their food served while we were waiting 45 mins longer for similar dishes. When we did get our food, it was cold. I told our server, Alfonzo, and he didn't say sorry nor did he ask how he could fix it. Instead, he pointed to the rice cooker in the kitchen and said \"see? It's hot. There's steam coming out.\" He looked annoyed that I was unhappy with cold food. I don't enjoy being rude back to servers, but I do believe that a little bit of customer services goes a very long way. Giving 3 stars instead of 1 because this is the one out of a hundred visits that went wrong and I hope that it doesn't become a usual thing."}
{"text":"Been eating here since it opened and never been disappointed. I suppose it may be a little pricey for the portions, but the portions are a perfect size - enough to make you satisfied but not so much that it goes to waste. I always get the Pad Thai, it's a little sweeter than what I find elsewhere but it's always very good. And the Thai Iced Coffee is a great way to get your midday caffeine fix. I'm glad to see this place is still around and that so many people love it as I do."}
{"text":"Food is on par with all the other great Thai places I've been. Knocking a few stars because I asked for some more rice and was charged $2 for a single scoop of rice. Rice is cheap and every other Thai restaurant I've been too will happily bring more if you ask. Just something to know. Other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I always get the roti curry as an appetizer. Give it a try, it's delish! My go to is the pineapple fried rice. I need to explore the menu a bit more but these 2 dishes are great. The service is good too. Very nice people!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat Thai food in this area. My wife and I are regular customers there and we have never been disappointed. Some times the Hotness levels are a bit off (food is a bit more spicy than what you asked for), but overall is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent place!! I used to come here all the time wen I lived nearby. I live pretty far from
This place now but still make the drive to done here. Love the food!"}
{"text":"I always get the pad thai beef  and the last time I was there the beef was chewy, I have eaten there about 7 times since moving here and that was the first time I was disappointed with my meal. I will go back I really enjoy the lunch there."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Didn't get what I ordered and chicken was hard and old. They would not give me my money back."}
{"text":"Panang Shrimp was amazing. Portion size was good too."}
{"text":"Great time with friends. Food was great and the staff and evident were also amazing. Would recommend to anyone in the area. Service was also quick."}
{"text":"The waitstaff is really friendly and accommodating. The restaurant itself had a nice, casual atmosphere. And the food is good and they have tofu and vegetable options for every single dish, so it's easy if you're a vegetarian. Also, the prices are reasonable and the service is pretty quick. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food in the valley that I've tried! My wife & I consider ourselves Thai connoisseurs. We've been to most of the Thai places in the area & Thai Patio is by far our favorite! Amazing yellow curry chicken with carrots & potatoes (sweeter coconut yellow curry than the other places....perfect balance!). Also, incredible Pad See Ew & Pad Thai....great flavors."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!
Fresh spring rolls made in house with a nice warm satay.
Pad thai.... amazing.
Noodle soup... lots of flavors.
Teriyaki chicken. .. chicken moist.. not over sauced and char marks on chicken were perfect. Fluffy rice to add. 
My kids have just rated it number 1.... no more fast food... yeah!"}
{"text":"I think my family and I found our new favorite Sunday lunch place! This place boasts great food, friendly employees, and a casual environment. My mom ordered the coconut shrimp curry, and despite not being a huge curry fan I thought it was delicious. I ordered the Chow Mein with beef, and that did not disappoint either. This is definitely a place to take advantage of during lunch. Can't beat the afternoon prices.. $7 and some change for a whole meal consisting of an entree, salad or soup (highly recommend the salad), and an egg roll. Then again, this place is so good I wouldn't mind paying a little extra for dinner!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for the last 4 yrs. Everything made here is fresh, from fresh ingredient's, hands down the best Thai food in the valley. My favorite is the panag curry. and the Tom Yum and Tom KAh soup will blow you mind. Great service Great food"}
{"text":"Pretty solid place for lunch. Had the orange chicken (I know, I know... but I'm not a curry guy and was out with co-workers) Decent food for a decent price."}
{"text":"The best Thai I've had on this side of town. The service was not the best, but the food makes up for it. The owner is the daughter of Thai Basil in Tempe and you can tell. The food tastes great and the prices are great too."}
{"text":"Super yummy!  You will not be disappointed.  I've had both the Pad Thai and the Panang Curry with Shrimp.  I have been craving it since!

Prices are reasonable and the staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Someone wrote an article about this place which captures my opinion exactly, \"Now you don't have to drive for 30 minutes to get good Thai food in NE Mesa.\"

I ordered drunken noodles, pad Thai, and Thai BBQ 
Chicken with fried rice...  All 3 were excellent and we ate them family style...

I have had Thai food all over the world, and though this place is not the greatest I have ever had, the fact that it's right around the corner gives it a huge bump.

Plus my son who is an incredibly picky eater LOVED it...  (="}
{"text":"Have been meaning to try thai patio for years now, and finally did this week. Service was super friendly, food was great, and the location is convenient. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Garlic King and Pot Stickers $20. Very expensive for what I received.  Food was cold, once heated up, the taste was OK.   There are much better Asian food in the area for a better price. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Thai food I've found in Arizona. I've even been to Thailand and this food tops the authentic Thailand food. So that should say a lot. Best Thai iced tea! Best pad see ew as well. The beef is soooo tender and it's not dry at all. I'm pretty lucky to live 5 min away from this place!"}
{"text":"Had to lay off for a while, I was recognized by phone number I ordered takeout so frequently... Even the occasionally burnt food or forgotten order is forgiven."}
{"text":"I live in San Diego and was visiting my daughter in Arizona.  After reading reviews of Thai Patio we decided to give it a try.  It's a cute little place but the food is just alright.  I definitely won't be going back.  Portions are small and not very tastey."}
{"text":"Good food, quick service. Nice clean interior. Had lunch and prices were decent. Will be back again"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and both times I've gotten my order to-go. I'm vegetarian so I haven't had any of the meat options, the veggies are great though, never mushy. I love the yellow curry, still haven't tried any of the others. The Thai Iced Tea is great and so is the Mango Sticky Rice! This last time we waited about 15 minutes for our to-go order after placing it at the restaurant, so not bad at all, but they gave us a free Tea for being patient. Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! The people are great! My favorite is the pineapple fried rice with combo seafood. Good helping and always cooked consistently each time we come here."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food I have ever tasted. Love the fact that you can choose you spice level. Every dish I have tried has been completely satisfying. Great service and wonderful people. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here today for first time to pick up lunch for my daughter and me we both order the lunch barbecue pork went take out if bag the salad was put in a plastic bag the pork was not cut up they did not give knives or forks I asked for forks not knowing I would need a knife  I did let them I was going were there was no place are silver ware . Food was good but not good enough for me to go back"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was so excited to try this place. We ordered the basil chicken, the mango chicken, the orange chicken and teriyaki chicken. We were not impressed with any of it. The chicken tasted watered down with no flavor. The orange and teriyaki were ok nothing amazing though. After spending 42 dollars for an ok meal. I'm not returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"OMG, woooow! The prices are right, and the food is AMAZING. The BBQ pork and BBQ chicken on the lunch menu (can't remember what numbers they are!) are sooooo good. 
The staff even offered to turn on the outdoor misters if I wanted to sit outside. Just for me! :)  I will definitely be back, with my husband & 2 young girls in tow. *** BTW- they do have 2-3 basic kids items on their menu in case your little one(s) don't want Thai food***"}
{"text":"Thai Patio has great food at reasonable prices. I am no Thai expert, but everything I have ordered .at Thai Patio has been delicious. I have had the Tom Yum (hot and spicy) soup, the #27 (sorry cant pronounce of spell it ) is amazing and the Pad Thai is very good. 

Prices are fixed @$6.95 for lunch for main course, small egg roll, salad and a drink! Dinner has fixed prices as well (seafood is a little extra) @ $8.95 per entree.

Service is very good and the food is always made fresh and is piping hot!"}
{"text":"Curry was really good :) I was not fond of this rendition of Pad Thai but I couldn't stay away from my boyfriend's curry oh my gosh. I ordered pick up and it was ready in good time with a lot of food :)"}
{"text":"This place has tge best Thai food I have ever head and I love there menu and the food it makes my mouth water and tgere spring rolls are to die for everone in my family love it"}
{"text":"Thai Patio is a good Thai restaurant for the price.  The restaurant is clean and the food comes out fairly quick."}
{"text":"I stopped by Thai Patio for the first time on Friday.  I ordered dinner for my husband and I and got it to go.  I wanted a variety so I ordered two appetizers, the Satay Chicken and the Pot Stickers, and two entrees, the Orange Chicken and the Green Curry. Since my order was 'to go' I expected the food to be not as good as if I'd eaten it at the restaurant fresh.  At Thai Patio however, everything was packaged to ensure the best experience possible at home as well.  The pot stickers, which were a crispy variety, were put in a styrofoam container with a hole cut in the side to release the steam and remained crispy by the time I got home.  The entrées were packaged separately from the rice, so everything could be assembled fresh at home.  Portions were generous and we had enough for a second meal.  The Satay Chicken came with two dipping sauces, a peanut sauce and a cucumber dip, both were excellent.  If my theory on the 'to go' food not being as good as if it was eaten fresh at the restaurant then eating 'in' would probably have to be 6 stars.  You definitely must give this one a try.  I'm already looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"Too much employee turn around, food is not consistent.. ordered thai hot and got very mild, food is lacking flavor too, beef is chewy also.  Cook needs to take earbuds out of his ears and pay attention to cooking and getting orders out... This place is now a generic thai food joint, there are better places not much farther from here... You guys lost my money, wont be back.. Im going to go to other establishments from now on.."}
{"text":"Good Thai food. To go orders are ready very fast. Iced Thai Tea is delicious.  Every time I drive by, I have to convince myself not to make a turn into their parking lot.  I would be broke if it were up to my taste buds!"}
{"text":"Decent Thai food.  Prices are a little on the high side for medium sized servings.  Still pretty good though."}
{"text":"I just moved here from South Bay area in Los Angeles, where Thai food is abundant.  Having just moved here, I yelped 'Thai restaurants' and to my surprise, a list of about 20 listings popped up, all within a 10 mile radius.  
In a quick summary., Unlike a popular LA trend of Sake being served at almost every Thai place, Thai Patio does not serve any alcohol beverages, much to our dismay.  
Between 3 people, we ordered 5 dishes simply because we wanted to try everything!  The boys love spicy, and they were eager for some heat. 'Thai spicy' which is their spiciest level, is what we ordered on a couple dishes.  In my case, I don't handle heat very well so I was very worried it would be too hot, but I was able to have a try of each dish noticing  very little heat.  So, the heat factor is slim to none.  On the other hand, the garlic king dish with beef was amazing, tender and very well marinated with a full flavor of garlic in every bite. The Thai style bbq chicken was only served cutlet style, which is a thumbs down, bone-in is way better in my opinion.   The Thai Iced Tea was delicious just I suspected, only desire was to have free refills.
I would love to try this place a few more times, maybe next time with someone in to more mild Thai dishes like myself."}
{"text":"Waited over 45 minutes for carry-out I was told would take 15 minutes. They never offered a cup of water, free dessert, discount on my next visit, NOTHING for the extreme delay. They were not busy, just very inexperienced and disorganized.

Pad Thai was over cooked and very greasy, no flavor at all. Plus the lid on my carry-out box had a huge hole in it so dinner was cold when I got it home.

They need a manager and some customer service training."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We usually get take-out and they run just a few minutes behind on a busy Friday or Saturday night but it is well worth the wait. Drunken noodles are my favorite and if you get them Thai hot, be prepared to do some sniffling. They mean HOT!! Great service the couple of times I've eaten there for lunch. I only wish they had a beer menu for dine-in because it would go great with their already delicious menu!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai in Mesa. Friendly and great food every time. They do takeout and is done within 25 minutes."}
{"text":"I have an Thai aunt and this is the closest I have found to her cooking. I have been going to Thai Patio for almost 4 years now and everything on their menu is delicious. We love the king of garlic with chicken, pad see we , and the larb. ( I like it with rice instead of cabbage) The owners are awesome and know my girlfriend and I by name . It's always a delicious filling meal . Thanks for the great food and service. You've got 2 life time customers."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love the Penang curry and the little salad it comes with at lunch. Service is always good and food is hot and delicious ."}
{"text":"My wife had cashew chicken that was extremely sweet. The waitress is really busy and left us quite thirsty. Overall food was ok for a cultural experience but the waitress took a long time to come and ask if we were thirsty. The pink sala was like drinking bubble gum. Not good. I had the tom Kai soup. It was ok."}
{"text":"Good service. Never crowded and authentic Thai cuisine. We have been here twice and will come back soon!"}
{"text":"This place use to be so good.  Not so much now.  The food is not consistent at all,  the food quality has decreased and whoever now cooks the food, need to take some Asian cooking classes. So sad... I use to love this place."}
{"text":"I've eaten quite a few meals at Thai Patio.  I've tried probably 2/3 of all the items on their menu and I usually try their weekly specials, too.
Everything I've had there is excellent.
This is the best Thai food in north east Mesa as of Sept 2011."}
{"text":"Every time I'm on this side of town I make it a point to stop at Thai Patio! I loveeeee this place and I'm never disappointed. Besides the food being amazing I have always had the best service. They found a customer in me for life!"}
{"text":"Finally moved to a location with a Thai  restaurant nearby. I ordered Panang and crab puffs. They called me almost immediately to let me know they were out of crab puffs...which made me sad but when I got everything home, I realized the Panang was plenty. Now, I ALWAYS get Panang...so I know good and bad.  This was definitely among the better that I've had. The curry serving size was average. I used all the rice for half the curry so it won't be enough to share.  Despite the small amount of rice, Id still give them 5 stars. I've seen many hole in the wall places that are drab and dirty. Not here..very bright and clean. Definite thumbs up and am ordering again tonight for everyone in the household this time."}
{"text":"I was in the area and stopped in for another try as the manager offered me a complimentary meal to make up for my first experience. I had the same server as the first time and she was still as sweet as ever. The food came quickly and much to my delight, it was a Thai 10 spice level as requested. I was in hot heaven!!! The flavor was incredible and it was a huge portion that I was able to make three meals out of. Thank-you Thai Patio! Your customer service is wonderful and I am very appreciative for my second experience. :)"}
{"text":"Great food.  Drunken noodles and curry is excellent.  Fried rice was good, but seemed average compared to how good the other stuff is.  Prices are fair.  The quality almost makes the order counter seem out of place.  On food alone, I would have thought it should be more of a traditional restaurant setting.

Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 years later, I returned. Moved away so I wanted to give Thai Patio another try. 

I arrived at noon on a Tuesday and there were four other tables full. I was greeted warmly right away and offered drink. I chose iced tea and then ordered Chicken Pad Thai on the lunch special menu. It came with soup or salad. 

My soup came out lunch in 6 mins. It was chicken and rice with ginger and miso undertones. Very good flavors. 

My lunch followed 3 minutes later. Huge improvement in that part of their service. I'm not confident that the patio guests got such quick service tho. 

The meal included a tiny vegetable egg roll. The portions were right for lunch as were the spice levels. The whole dish was saucy, which is a must for Pad Thai. There was also plenty of protein. All in all, a solid dish of yum."}
{"text":"First of all I would like to say that this place is awesome!  The owners are super nice and the food is awesome.  I get food from Thai Patio almost every week, and try a new dish almost every time, and have yet to come across something I didn't like (although Pad Thai has my favorite vote).  I know the owners and staff personally and they try very hard to make every customer happy.  

Now as far a Dean O.'s review I have this to say.
Obviously YOU have never had real Thai food before, considering nearly all Asian dishes DO consist of about half veggies.  And the price, you say $40 for four dishes (which $10 per dish is normal in a restaurant) but then contradict yourself in saying you had 6 dishes you were unhappy with and stating soups you had tried as well.  4 dishes plus adding at least 2 soups for $40 is cheap.  Consumers like you who trash talk our local businesses without GOOD reason and demand free food are the reason our economy is in the crapper.  Might I suggest Panda Express across the road next time you are thinking you want Asian?  Sounds like your tastes will be more satisfied there."}
{"text":"So yummy! A very good spot for a quick lunch. The service here is excellent. Also this is the first Thai place I have been to where I asked for not very spicy and got it! I'm usually crying my eyes out but the yellow curry I got was perfect :) the iced coffee was a little sweet for me but I imagine everyone asks for it to be sweeter. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Amazing! Pad sew ew was bombbbbbbbbbbb! && the egg rolls! Thanks for the huge vegetarian friendly selection on the menu! I live right down the street. This is my new favorite place!!!!!!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night and the small restaurant was half full but seemed to be plenty of work for the staff.  While servers were very friendly and apologetic, the food took a very long time to come out.  Once out, I was sad to find I was not impressed.  The papaya salad had dressing that was overly sweet and overly sour.  The description said it contained shrimp and there were literally two shrimp sitting on top (see picture).  I did not enjoy this salad but the worst part is that they charged $10 for a pile of shredded papaya.  The pad see ew was good but that's a dish that's quite safe to get at any Thai place.  The spicy eggplant was good too but portion was quite small for $11.  I really want to like small, family owned restaurants, but I don't think I was convinced to return."}
{"text":"Overall I've been very happy with their customer service and quality of food. However tonight I was quite appalled when a manager was yelling at the top of her voice at an employee near the front door of the restaurant! I don't know the situation, but I do know that as a manager that you have those conversations in private and away from customers. I felt very uncomfortable and almost walked out. Please be more professional and handle your staffing issues privately and not in front of us. Shame on  you!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their fried rice, and the mango sticky rice is da bomb! 

But, i cant help but be grossed out by the VERY dirty and greasy ceiling tiles, air vents, and kitchen ceiling. Staff, PLEASE clean the place!!!! It really takes away from the experience."}
{"text":"Incredible Service and Marvelously Flavorful Food! Im Their BIGGEST FAN! I Highly Recommend All of you Gibe it a Taste!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food, with nice outdoor seating. Friendly service, good quality, no complaints."}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered take out from Thai Patio two Sundays in a row. Normally, we have our favorite Thai place that we eat at which is not too far from our house but since that place is closed on Sundays and I was in the mood for a quick Thai noodles dish, I looked for an alternative on Yelp and found Thai Patio & I'm glad I did! 
Even though some reviews talked about the food being bland, most agreed that the noodle dishes were great. My husband and I are big fans of Pad See Eew beef and I love Pad Thai so yesterday we ordered just that for take out (Pad Thai chicken though) and my husband picked them up. 
The convenience in take out is great but I normally don't prefer it bcz I worry about the food arriving cold; not in this case though! Because the food is cooked fresh and the restaurant is very close to where we live, the food arrived super hot, I still had to be careful not to burn my mouth when I ate! Nice! 
We dug in and the pad see eew in particular was great (I ordered one last week too and it was really good). I had the pad Thai a little later and while it tasted very good, it was a little dry, probably my fault though coz I waited for a while before I ate it and I have noticed more than once that those rice noodles usually suck up the sauce very quickly. Nevertheless, both dishes were really good and fresh. We asked for the chili sauce to be on the side so we can control the level of heat, and their chili sauce was really good too! When we added it to the food it gave it a really great kick. 
I am so glad we found this place. Even though we have our favorite Thai restaurant, I think when it comes to those particular dishes, I have actually enjoyed them more here! Not to mention the fact that they open everyday particularly on Sundays & they are closer to our home. 
I will try different dishes hopefully in the next times but for now, I think this is my fav Thai place for our favorite noodle dishes! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is that this thai place has no lime or fish sauce in their food.  
I even requested it and they said they didn't have any. 
that's two basic ingredients in all thai dishes.  I was not so happy with the food;("}
{"text":"After going thru a bit of a trial and error period with local Thai restaurants, I think I've settled in on my go to place... Thai Patio. 

Since I've only ever gotten take-out, I don't have any first hand experience with the service in the restaurant, but at the counter placing the order and picking up they have been friendly and very accommodating. So, my 4 Stars is only related to the take out service and limited number of things I've had on the menu, but so far so good.  We've had the Thai Patio Spicy Mint w/Chicken, Spicy Basil w/ Pork and Chowmein noodles and all have been solid.  The Mango Sticky Rice is like crack and my daughter is totally hooked on the Thai Iced Tea. 

I've ordered using the Yelp app and it was seamless. But when either using the app or ordering in person at the counter, the wait has been a little on the long side. With that being said, they have always been apologetic and tried to be accommodating with a drink and refill while we waited.  Like I said, considering the Land of Misfit Toys I've been thru trying to find a decent Thai restaurant, I can manage the wait time."}
{"text":"Cute, clean, and cozy Thai restaurant in east Mesa. Service is gracious, speedy, and friendly. Lunch prices can't be beat. I got a choice of soup or salad with my entree as well as a fried spring roll with a drink for $11. The panang curry with beef is very tasty. Their Thai iced tea is delish, too."}
{"text":"What Rebekah said! So happy to FINALLY have great Thai in our 'hood. And it's as good as any Thai I've ever had!! I've had the spicy basil (really delicious sauce and nice veggies), drunken noodles (my fave noodle dish and this is as tasty as I've had) and the bbq pork lunch special which was sweet grilled goodness.

I will be going multiple times per week!"}
{"text":"Delicious Pad Thai! Green Curry was out of this world good.  I've never had eggplant that was so tender and delicious.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Lunch orders are 8.00 not 7.00. Food is good... really good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've been going here since they opened. The owners are a nice young couple and they work very hard. Everything is always fresh and tasty. I especially love the Thai Patio Salad, the Pad Thai, the Red Curry and the Red Garlic River. Great food!"}
{"text":"Good stuff!  Had exceptional service!  I live in the area and had never tried it.  I love Thai so figured why not.  I typically go to Yuphas in Tempe, which I LOVE - but this place is really good too.  It is a little pricey compared to other Thai places, but I will be returning."}
{"text":"Thai Patio is so awesome!  The staff is always friendly whether ordering on the phone or dining in.  The lunch specials are so delicious with the right amount of food for the price.  I make Thai Patio my once a week stop for my favorite Pad See Ew."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend and it was okay. The customer service was alright and my overall experience was just... eh. The food wasn't very tasty."}
{"text":"So ... I left the range today, and as usual, on my way out of the parking lot, I called Thai Patio.  I do this nearly every Tuesday evening and every other Sunday afternoon.  The time was 5:02PM.  My call dropped due to the location of the range amongst the mountains, which sometimes happens, I could hear him, but he could not hear me.  Sadly, the call dropped after I gave my name and \"Pad Thai with chicken\" Them saying, \"Hello, hello, Chris? How spicy?  Hello?\" I never even got to the spice level, much less the second or third items I was going to order.  I tried again at 5:03 and 5:04 (5 attempts total), and it would ring, but not connect.  My phone had about 2% battery life, and by this time, I was on the road, so I skipped the Thai Patio meal.  The order was not complete, so I figured that was that.

At 7:32 they called and I did not recognize the number, so let it go, no voicemail, probably some car warranty wanker, I thought.  They called again at 7:54, so I answered and explained the above.  Then at 7:55 I got a voicemail requesting I call them or call back next time to cancel my order.  Like they were shaming me for placing an order and skipping out on them.  I called back at 7:57 to explain the issue again.  I did not finish the first item on the order so I am not sure why they would have prepared it or expected me to call back and cancel it.  The call dropped, so maybe they should have reached out to me closer to 5:10 if the order was going to put them into some sort of jeopardy.

In any event, they were very upset that they had an order of Pad Thai with chicken prepared to an unknown spice level (now nearly 3 hours old) and nobody to pay for it.  The poor kid relayed my words to the manager as I explained.  The tone was like the kid was very ashamed of my behavior.  It was freaking weird.  Maybe the kid was just in a bad spot between me and his manager.  I had no animosity and apologized for my part in the mis-understanding.  They, however, did not.

All of my visits there ... well over 100 in the last few years. Most times with a to-go order for dinner after I ate lunch there.  All of my recommendations to others and positive online reviews.  Let's not forget the tips that are always in the 35% range even on a take-out order. 

I will not go there again.  I thought for a moment that I would go there an pay them for the Pad Thai and tell them to shove it as I walked out, but that is not worth the effort.  I must say, I have never been treated like that by a restaurant, much less a restaurant where I am a semi-regular.  Off-hand, I cannot think of a single business (aside from car dealers) that has ever gotten on my wick like these folks.  I am still shocked and very uncomfortable at the tone of the kid.  I get it, they run a business, but that was a bit much for a single menu item.  They spent more in wages shaming me than they lost on the dish.  They obviously value their customers less than the $5 cost of an menu item due to  a dropped call and subsequent misunderstanding.

I guess Chon Thai in Chandler will be my go to place for Thai food.  They have better food and the best customer service I have encountered in many years.

I officially cannot, in good conscience, recommend Thai Patio, as they have lost sight of their singular goal ... customer service."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and I would say it's some of the best Thai food I've had. I've tried a few things including their pad Thai, pad se ew, thai fried rice, and yellow curry. The only thing that I wasn't a big fan on was the yellow curry. A little too sweet for my liking and it wasn't as thick as some of the better yellow curries I have had. You really can't beat their lunch special though. For $7.95 you get an entree and that comes with a salad (granted it's probably the smallest salad you will ever eat, but the dressing is amazing) and an egg roll. Great special. Definitely didn't expect to find good Thai food in east Mesa but if you come here you will be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Awesome ! Very impressed . Im a huge lover of Thai food and critical and this place blew my mind!! The pepper steak and spicy fried rice are a couple of our fave dishes . The fried bananas are awesome also ! We went in with only a man working the kitchen and a woman serving and a baby in a high chair in the kitchen , I was little worried about the quality since they seemed to be short staffed, but they still nailed it and were polite! Seeing how hard they worked and maintained the quality  made me a loyal customer !!"}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent!! The food, service and atmosphere. The iced tea was not great, but the food was phenomenal! I had the Pad Thai with fried tofu, medium heat and it was excellent. Egg rolls were fresh and the orange sauce tasted like they make it fresh, not from a bottle. We found our new best place!"}
{"text":"We went in to order to go. The place was very cute(but a little small so not much seating). The workers were very friendly and easy to talk to. Great service. My grandma, my mom, and I ordered Orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, and pineapple friend rice with pork. Everything is absolutely delicious. I definetly recommend going."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We ordered take out. The spring rolls where hardly anything special and 6 dollars for 2! It was iceberg lettuce, carrots and unflavored chicken. The portions were small, We paid probably 55 dollars and barely  had enough to feed 4 people. The pad Thai noodles were pretty good. But the beef jerky size was tiny, our rice was a hard as a brick it was inedible.! Not sure if take out it just not the way to go. Sorry won't be going back.. It was a bad experience especially since we had a friend over and we were trying to portion the curry chicken, beef, inedible rice brick..."}
{"text":"Thai patio has some decent quick thai food. Whether you are dining in or taking out, food usually arrives pretty quickly. With that said, it's not the best or most authentic thai food, but still pretty good. I usually stick with the noodle dishes or fried rice. The pad thai and pad see ew are my usual orders. Both are good with chicken. When I ventured out and tried the curry, I wasn't very pleased. I like my curry thicker. I know thai curry is a little more runny (unlike Indian curry), but it was a little too much for me and a little bland. Noodle dishes are definitely my favourites here."}
{"text":"OMG!!

I love GOOD and authentic Thai food and that's hard to find. Thai patio fits the bill! The owner/operator is from Thailand and his menu is authentic and delicious! I have been going there weekly for a couple of years...each new choice is a delight!! Pad Thai and Drunken Noodle are my favorites!  They are to die for! And massaman curry, and chicken noodle, and, and, and....

YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Just decided to stop here as a last minute decision.  What a pleasant surprise.    Staff was very accommodating and food was fantastic.  It may not be the fanciest place in the area but if you are looking for good, fresh Thai food this is the place.  Menu has an abundance of choices and i cant wait to go back and try some more."}
{"text":"This place has the best pad thai and orange chicken that I've ever had. Everything about the place is top shelf! Service is very prompt with attention to coutesy. This is my third time here and will undoubtedly be back for more."}
{"text":"Fairly good food but very poor service for takeout.  We've tried this place 5 or 6 times now. This is the last.  The first 5 times, after placing order by phone and waiting a half hour or so, I went to pick up food and each time they didn't start cooking food until I arrived. On the last visit, they left the appetizers off of my order. This time, their phone stayed busy for more than 30 min. I finally gave up and drove to restaurant to order in person since it would now be closing in a half hour. (I only gave them this final chance because they owed me free food for what was left off my last order.) There are many other Thai restaurants in town. I'll drive by this one from here on out to go to one of the others."}
{"text":"Great place for quick take out, probably order it once or twice a week. Spicy Basil with chicken and a cup of Tom Yum. Always quick and the food is great"}
{"text":"Good food, decent service, nice neighborhood location.

I had avoided this place in the past because I made some assumptions about it based on its location. I didn't think it would be all that great, what with it being in a strip mall in a grocery store parking lot. I'm glad I finally got over that assumption, because this is a solid restaurant, and it's very convenient for me.

I went in at lunchtime on a weekday. There were a few tables of people in the restaurant, but it wasn't very busy. There aren't many offices nearby, so that wasn't really surprising to me. I imagine this place gets more dinnertime business than lunchtime traffic. There are only a few tables inside, along with some bar seating from where you can see a bit of the cooking action.

The service was mostly attentive. I was seated quickly and given some recommendations on what was good. The menu is separated into the lunch menu and dinner menu. There are a number of lunch options for $8, and they include soup (or salad, I believe) and a fried spring roll. You can get brown rice for $1 extra or fried rice for $2 extra.

I ordered the mango dish with brown rice and the egg drop soup. The egg drop soup was good--certainly edible, but nothing fantastic. The spring roll was fresh and hot and wasn't greasy. And the mango dish itself was quite good. There were plenty of vegetables--something that is important to me--along with the chicken and the mango. Considering that the dish emphasizes mango, there wasn't a whole lot of mango on the plate, but what there was was fresh and was a  nice addition to the plate.

I'll definitely be back here in the future. I've certainly had better Thai, but this is a solid offering."}
{"text":"NE Mesa residents- this is the best Thai restaurant in the area.  FYI....they do not serve alcohol. Please note ....we only do carry out.  They have been consistent with their curries 40 & 41..so delicious.  We love #43, Pad Thai, Cashew Nut, Heaven ginger & spicy basil.  We only order to go....expect a 15-20 min wait.  The food is delicious....the staff is courtesy.  It's a must try for lovers of Thai food. Don't let this one slip away."}
{"text":"I've tried literally EVERYTHING on the menu except for a few of the special dishes. This is without question THE BEST Thai restaurant I have EVER eaten at. And trust me, I've been to several. 

The cooks are very accommodating. You can choose to have chicken, beef, pork, fish, squid, soft or fried tofu, or veggies in practically very dish, which has been a great adventure for me! You also have your choice between mild, medium, hot, or extra/Thai hot (which is my favorite).  I've talked with the owners extensively, and they bring fresh ingredients from the market every day! 

My favorite dishes there are the curries. They are indescribably delicious. Especially the yellow and panang curries. Okay, and the red and green and mussaman. 

Their noodle dishes are great, too! The pad Thai is by far the best I've had compared to any other restaurant. They make the sauce from scratch! Other noodle dishes that I love are the drunken noodle (it's a little spicy), the Rad Nah, and their out-of-this-world chow mein (seriously, it puts all other chow mein to chow SHAME!). 

The rice dishes are amazing! They're really kid friendly too! Pineapple fried rice is sweet and you can add a kick to it too if you'd like. The crab fried rice is also to die for!

Other dishes that I heavily endorse are the spicy basil, the cashew nut, the spicy eggplant, the pepper steak, and the pad woon sen. 

Also, their orange chicken is made crispy. I prefer it that way. 

The only dish that hasn't blown my socks off is the heaven ginger. If you REALLY love ginger, then you'll love it. 

As a side note, the restaurant is meticulously clean (especially the bathrooms) and the patio has misters. I love the plants they have growing inside and out. 

WAIT! I forgot to mention that the sweet sticky rice dishes are SO GOOD. They make a great denouement to any meal!

Amen."}
{"text":"Great food! Great prices! and nice and clean. My parents normally stay away from Thai food and other food deemed exotic but I have sold them on this place. They have a great lunch menu with around 15 options and they're all $7.00! What would bump it up to five for me is if their servers were Thai. I've asked two who appear to be East Asian but they're not Thai. I've spent the last few years learning the language and love having the chance to practice it."}
{"text":"Thai Patio is a small Thai restaurant in the Safeway retail strip at the S/E corner of McKellips and Power. First of all, anyone who knows me knows that I am a superfan of online ordering. Thai Patio has a full online menu, with average pricing. We ordered seafood yellow curry, tofu panang curry and mango sticky rice.
The parking lot was shared with a bar, so it was packed, and a bit difficult to find a spot. Upon pick-up, our food was ready as promised. When I got home, I noticed that they don't (or didn't) pack any napkins or utensils. No biggie. The staff was friendly, and the restaurant looked really clean and bright.
The yellow curry was flavorful and had large shrimp...like I would call them prawns, large. There were 5 shrimp, along with fish and scallops. We substituted brown rice. The panang also had great flavor. There was a good amount of tofu. My only gripe was the ridiculous amount of onions in the dish. There were a few green peppers, but no other vegetables.  The mango sticky rice was one of the best we have had. I missed not having a toasted sesame seed sprinkle though...first world problems. It was great.
We will definitely eat at Thai Patio again."}
{"text":"I am from the northwest which has a ton of asian cuisine. I tried this place since I have been craving thai since I moved down. I really enjoyed my meal. The menu is expansive and impressive for Thai cuisine and their sauces are delicious. The best part is that the lunch menu is very affordable. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Simply an excellent and pleasant wait staff that gets to serve the best Thai food in the area. We did pad Thai, green curry, and sweet and sour. All exceptional. Here, people, is a bonafide chef who knows ingredients and how to use them. Coconut ice cream for dessert. This is made in the restaurant by the chef. It is real ice cream that increases in flavor as you eat it. A wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"So, every now and then I get myself a hankering for curry or various Asian dishes like pad Thai and more. I've been to a lot of different Thai places, and I gotta admit, when I came down to have a quick dinner here, it was awesome to see these folks really know what they're doing! Today I decided to try their Roti Curry and the fried roti complimented the savory sweetness of the chicken curry absolutely perfectly. And then the pad Thai is also to die for! Authentic Thai food at very reasonable prices (especially with their lunch time specials), definitely coming here more often and recommend to any one wanting to try something new, likes Thai food or just a really good curry!"}
{"text":"This place Is solid time after time. Friendly staff and fresh yummy food. I'd recommend both dinner and lunch here."}
{"text":"This place has seriously great food. Very fresh, good portions, and fairly good prices. We have come here quite often and the service is always good, the food is always fast, and it's tasty. We have tried all the different curries, as well as the pad thai and it is very good and has a great kick because it's very spicy. The thai iced tea is also really great, probably the best I've had. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Thai Patio last night to give it a try. I had a coupon for a free appetizer, so we ended up with an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert (the ice cream over sticky rice). Everything was excellent! Very good and the service was attentive. I really liked the cute decor of the restaurant, although the tables are a little close together for my liking. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food with a lot of flavor! I got the spiciest options for my Red Curry and Pad Thai and they were delightful! The inside of the restaurant is clean and they are very friendly. Will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"My family absolutely loves this place. We tend to pick up our food for carryout. I have to highly recommend the pineapple fried rice. We love supporting local businesses and this place is awesome! If you are ever in the area give it a try, the customer service goes above and beyond and the food is great!"}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite Thai place around. Every single one of their noodle dishes are incredible and the serving size is more than enough. The staff has always been outgoing and friendly and I have never been disappointed with my experience here. I don't eat out much, but when I do, it's here!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai Food. Very clean and very friendly. The food is reasonable and always come out fresh and hot. The food is a healthier option and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cheap alternative."}
{"text":"Exploring east Mesa, great stop for lunch.  Fabulous panang curry.  Hubby enjoyed his hot basil dish.  The server was very personable and on top of it."}
{"text":"Love their Pineapple Fried Rice with Chicken. Always get it medium spicy, which can really be anywhere from mild to hot, but it's never been too hot."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are a great deal. My favorite is the orange chicken. :)"}
{"text":"I have had several items off the menu and have always been satisfied with my meals.
My favorites, bbq pork, beef, or chicken in that order. Spicy basil, king of garlic, pad thia,  and the list goes on.
Use thier online app for pickup."}
{"text":"Thai Patio is excellent!  I often order the Pad Gra Pow (lunch special #6) and it is always delicious.  You can decide how spicy you want your dish to be, from mild all the way up to Extra Spicy!  For $6.95, you get a delicious Thai dish + Soup or salad + an egg roll.  What a deal!  The drunken noodles are also a favorite.

Try this place, you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight and the food is wonderful! The you do lady at the counter was super helpful and happy to explain all the I signature dishes to me. I know it can be hard to judge a place off one visit so I will certainly be returning, but at this point I have a good feeling this is going to be a new favorite place! I ordered the Thai ice tea and Pad See Ew (hot)"}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place has gotten so many positive reviews.  The only positive thing was that it was clean and the waiter was on top of everything. But the food was highly disappointing.  Chicken satay was the same as the bbq chicken.  Was nothing like any chicken satay I've ever had before.  Not very good either.  Peanut sauce was awful.  Tom kha kai was eh. Not very good either.  I left afterward still wanting thai food."}
{"text":"Thai patio is a gear place for lunch! They have awesome lunch specials (6.95 per plate) and the food is amazing! Try the yellow curry. Also the staff is always super polite, I love coming here! Food is sooooo tasty"}
{"text":"Excellent!! I work just around the corner and finally decided to step in for lunch, SO GLAD I DID! I got their orange chicken lunch special to go and was surprised by how much food they give you for the price. Everything was delicious and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Great food. The green curry is the best I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious. It has a fresh ingredient taste to it that many Thai places around the valley lack. My one critique: I have waited to put my order in for 20+ minutes multiple times because they are busy and understaffed, or my personal favorite was the owner lady talking and laughing on the phone and ignoring me. They fix those issues, they would be an easy 5 stars. The food is very good."}
{"text":"I want to try every single thing on the menu!  I love Thai Patio.  I walked in and the staff knows the menu well.  They all love Thai food.  There are so many different types of curry and noodles.  Spicy curry has a good kick to it, but the spicy noodles are almost inedible because they are soooo spicy.  So beware, if you order anything with rice noodles or tofu, they become extra spicy soaking up chile.  Almost everything has Thai basil in it.  I recommend driving even 25 miles to this location.  Love the yellow curry and Panang curry, the extra wide drunken noodles, everything."}
{"text":"Oh my freakin goodness.
We just tried Thai Patio for the first time and couldn't be more satisfied. We got the orange chicken (as per Yelp! Review recommendations) and I had the Panang Curry, and it was oh so delicious.
This will not be the last time you see us, Thai Patio. Planning our next dinner there already! :)"}
{"text":"Third time here. This time I had Heaven Ginger, last time Red Curry, and time before an appetizer selection. All of them were fresh, flavorful and veggies all tender crisp. Add that to the service - pop glass never empty"}
{"text":"Why would you close your kitchen 30 minutes before your listed hours? That's just bad business. 
Maybe that's not how it is in Thailand, but in every American restaurant I've ever been in, you can walk in at 9:27 and get served. Yes, it's s****y of you to do so, but the hours listed are the hours the kitchen is open."}
{"text":"So I decided to venture out around my neighborhood and found this place. Here is my review: Upon entry I knew this would be an odd experience. It looked more like a smoothie place versus a Thai food restaurant. Other than not having proper Thai spices (think fish oil, chilies, etc..) the pad Thai was sub-par at best! My boy got the sweet and sour chicken and was not to happy with the familiar taste of mediocre food! This was a huge disappointment. The Thai Ice Coffee wasn't too good either. And to think about it, the Thai iced tea kinda sucked as well. Over all this was a fake Thai food joint. I will NEVER return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Very quick service. I came and order a chicken pad Thai and Thai tea. It's weird that they don't mix up the drink before they give it to the customers. Most place I order the drinks from, its already mixed. The pad Thai is good but some place also offer tofu in it as well, not a big deal..."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for Mesa, I had the heaven ginger which was flavorful and spicy. Service was good, price is fair, I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"It is difficult to believe that I haven't reviewed this place before. Time to remedy that!

I've been coming here since they opened several years ago and I'm still a fan. Things have changed a bit over the years, but I think the quality of the food has remained the same, which is a good thing.

The food is the best Thai I've had in NE Mesa, and the prices are awfully reasonable, especially for lunch at about $8 for the items on that menu. Note that the lunches are served with a salad or soup, but to go orders are always salad. 

I like spicy food and the curries seem to be on the milder side (\"hot\" is more like \"medium\" to me)... but \"hot\" for the soups without coconut milk in them can be like drinking fire. Maybe I have caught the soup on an extra spicy day.  :)

I really like their salad dressing and the spicy basil with chicken is excellent. I mostly get it to go, and it is usually hot and ready in the time it takes me to drive from my house."}
{"text":"Bomb! Number 34, spicy eggplant. Amazeballs! Fresh basil kicked it up a notch. Love places that offer brown rice. The sauce on the spicy eggplant was insanely delish. Veggies tasted crunchy and fresh. Ordered a side salad and it had ginger dressing that was delish, but the salad was just a bunch of lettuce. At least it wasn't iceberg. Def a place worth coming back to, flavorful and fresh! Not much meat on it, but that's okay. Sometimes it is good to load up on the veggies, especially when they taste this great!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I had Thai food so I went here based on previous reviews.  I asked for a recommendation and they suggested a red curry dish with chicken.  I ordered medium spice which was just about right for a first time.  Everyone's medium is different.  The food and service was very good and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Out of all the items I have tried so far on the menu, my favorite has been the Mango Delight and the Thai Fried Rice.  Both are amazing!  The vegetable delight was also pretty good.  The only thing that I have ordered that I haven't liked was the Pad Thai.  The noodles were wayyyyy overcooked, not enough bean sprouts and overly spicy.  I love extra spicy food and I ordered it medium spice and I could barely eat it.  I would recommend ordering mild or in between mild and medium spice the first time you try it out to be on the safe side.  I generally go here for lunch and the specials include an awesome small but delicious side salad.  The dressing is what makes this salad so tasty!  It also includes an egg roll with an awesome dipping sauce as well.  I would also recommend sitting on the outdoor patio as they have a misting system that will keep you cool while you enjoy the outdoors."}
{"text":"My roomie & I love this place. I.had the Red River Garlic and she had King of Garlic. Both were fresh, garlicky and delish! I also had the crab wonton which I highly recommend. A sweet iced coffee for desert and I am one happy hiker!"}
{"text":"I'm a seasoned customer for the past 3 years. Unfortunatly, due to their constant change of staff, the food is either a hit or miss. I always order the same thing, and depending who's working, it'll either be great or horrible. Also depending on the staff, you'll either get great service or downright rude service. Eat here if you're feelin a bit daring and lucky."}
{"text":"My husband and in ALWAYS have the most exceptional service  here!! The panang curry is literally heaven in a bowl! A pleasure every single time ."}
{"text":"Munch munch munch! So good!  It is very exciting to have a good Thai restaurant in NE Mesa!  Their Tom Yum is delicious, I love the delicate broth and button mushrooms.  I order my dishes Thai hot, and while it isn't mouth searing like some other places, it is still spicy.  The beef salad was a surprise winner.  The beef was tender and succulent, and the lime dressing was out of this world!  Skip the crab puffs though...very little filling-to-wrapper ratio."}
{"text":"Mmm delicious Thai food! They have a really polite make server in particular who is always so quick and pleasant. I love the pad see ew and it's good with chicken or beef!"}
{"text":"This place - - - has decent Pad Thai.  Pricey for dinner, OK for lunch."}
{"text":"The food lacks a bit of flavor and the portion sizes are horribly small for the price.  I tried the teriyaki the first time I visited, it was not good at all, I do not suggest ordering this.  I knew teriyaki would be a risk at a thai place but coming from Washington we have some awesome teriyaki and I was craving it.  Today I ordered the Thai Patio Broccoli, it's pretty good just doesn't have a whole lot of flavor and as stated the portion is really bad for $8.95.  I would probably not go back to this restaurant.  There has to be better thai food in Arizona where you get more then a tiny bowl."}
{"text":"This place is quite a drive from where we are living, but if we have the time, it is ALWAYS our first choice for Thai food. I absolutely LOVE the Thai Patio Spicy Mint dish. It is traditionally served with red peppers, onions, mint and garlic but I don't care for the red peppers, so I sub in something else, usually broccoli. There is a lot of mint in the dish, hence the name. It is divine, but again, it is NEVER spicy enough, even though I always order it Thai Hot. I can't dock any stars for this, because most people don't like their food Thai Hot spicy, so these places cater to the typical customer. I have tried it with shrimp, tofu, pork, and chicken. I like it in that order. I won't order it with chicken again. I love their green curry too. Very flavorful and fresh tasting. I need to remember to have them cut down on the amount of bell peppers in the dish. They love their bell peppers at Thai Patio. My husband loves the King of Garlic, always ordered with pork. It is very good. He also loves the pork jerky, but I was not a fan. I like their version of the papaya salad. Not traditional, but good. Their soups are good too, especially the Tom Kha. We have always had great service there. Very pleasant, and I even had a problem once with a dish. The owner fixed it immediately and was very sincere with his apology. Handled perfectly. Darn it...now I'm hungry..."}
{"text":"Good service. Decent food. Spring rolls with chicken good. They make a genuine effort."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmmmmmm!! Love Thai Patio! We order at least once a week for take out! The Pad Thai is amazeballs!! My husband swears by the yellow curry! Go try it, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Thai restaurant in East Mesa now.  Food is excellent, great prices and service is quick."}
