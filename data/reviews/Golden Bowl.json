{"text":"We ordered take out for the family and it was horrible. I actually threw my meal away based on the smell when I opened the container. 2 meals were tried and tossed out after a few bites. You can guess the reaction they had that evening from those few bites. Never will order again even with other good reviews. Kind of sad I wanted it to be good being its close to home for us."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, decent prices, and great customer service. Everytime I order they go above and beyond making sure my order is right and packaged perfectly so nothing is spilled or ruined! This place is a weekly routine for me."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Very clean inside, very fast for take out, the sweet and sour chicken was delicious!   Thank you, ladies!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped in today to hit up their lunch buffet. The interior is what you'd expect from a strip mall Chinese restaurant, golden cat statue waving at you at the register. The whole place is nice and clean, decorations aren't over done and instead of the usual Chinese ambient music they have the radio set to done top 40 station. The lunch buffet was 5.95 and includes one drink, they have a nice selection off canned sodas and ice tea as well as various bottled teas. There is a purified water cooler for free if you finish your drink and don't feel like buying another. But above all else the food was on point. Everything was hot and fresh and the staff made sure everything stayed that way. I honestly felt bad that they were only charging $5.95, they could easily charge at least $2.00 more and I wouldn't even bat an eye for the quality of the food. Give them a shot, totally worth it."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before I came and everybody seem to like this place... I don't eat Chinese food often but today I was in the mood and when I walked in the lady at the desk has a HUGE SMILE the customer service was great! I paid 5.95 for the lunch buffet and the food was excellent and it comes with a drink ! . Such a great deal and this place is very clean ! I recommend this place to everyone !"}
{"text":"Best Chinese buffet in Elyria. Bourbon chicken is spectacular. Very comparable in price."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and reasonable prices and portions. The entrees were good, but the crab rangoons weren't crunchy and the vegetable egg rolls were bland. They also got one of our orders wrong, giving us chicken instead of shrimp. I'd give them one more chance if I lived in the area and would update my review, but I was just passing through."}
{"text":"Good food and great prices.  Love the buffet for the price it's almost always packed at lunch time."}
{"text":"The food has always been a great quality. Definitely my go to for some quick take out. The staff has been very friendly every time we go and helpful as well. They have a great gift voucher system so if you have a big family and make a large order you get money off your next transaction! Definitely helpful in a pinch."}
{"text":"We finally broke away from our favorite Chinese take out place here in Elyria and tried Golden Bowl. So glad we did. Our old place had been letting us down for the last few months and our daughter wanted Sweet and Sour Chicken for dinner. Hubby suggested we try a new place. They were packing our food when my husband arrived to pick it up. It was piping hot and fantastic. Our combination dishes were cooked to perfection. The egg rolls weren't burnt, greasy or fishy tasting. We got plenty of fortune cookies and some tasty new hard candies. This is our new go to place for Chinese take out!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite go-to for Chinese.  Fast, friendly service for either eat-in or take-out.   Free crab rangoon sample each time we've ordered.  Sesame chicken is awesome!"}
{"text":"Food is good but I just learned that waitresses do not get to keep any part of THEIR tip! They have to hand it over to the owners. Isn't that illegal??"}
{"text":"I should preface this review by saying the 4 stars is assuming you seek Good \"americanized chinese delivery type place\". If you are looking for sweet and sour pork, good fried rice etc of that variety it is a pretty good local shop :) .   However if you are from china or china town, or expect authentic... This aint that kikda place, not in house regional or spicy sauces for the more advanced pallet... nor spicy fish, salt/pepper squid, or the more traditional authentic menu items. Just need to differentiate that but its good for americanized :)"}
{"text":"Golden Bowl is our go-to for Chinese.  Not only is it the most convenient for us to get to but the food is delicious, consistent, and the people are the most friendly I have encountered.  On my very first visit, they forgot to put an egg roll in with my combo.  Before I even unpacked my food at home they were calling my phone to notify me of their mistake.  The owner told me next time I come in to tell them, and they'd make sure I received a free one.  How can you be upset with customer service like that?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The service is always super friendly and upbeat. The food comes is incredibly well made. They offer amazing deals and offering delivery was the cherry on top. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really great food, fresh and flavorful. Love eating in as it is a unique dining experience. Give it a try  my pics are a hint want to expect."}
{"text":"Employees are all very friendly and the place is very clean. I wouldn't say it is the best Chinese food I've ever had but it's decent. We ordered the general Tso combo plate and the chicken was kind of dry and stringy. We will definitely be back but probably will try ordering something different. It was very busy when we ordered our takeout so the wait was close to an hour, but that seemed like a good sign of good food."}
{"text":"Been hear on numerous Times in my opinion it's the best Chinese restaurant in the Elyria area! Conveniently located in Chestnut Commons great for takeout inside atmosphere OK lunch buffet super. Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys good Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed that they changed their delivery schedule to a time based system. I have been a customer for years and now they lost my business over 3 minutes"}
{"text":"This place has the best buffet (11-3p).  Usually stop in once a week. Price increased to 6.35 for the buffet but still a great value!!!"}
{"text":"This is me my husband's go to Chinese place we ordered from here at least twice a month and you get the best food for your money and the people are so nice and the delivery is quick and it's just perfect."}
{"text":"Best.Chinese food. EVER. This is the only place I go for Chinese. I love the owners, they are so nice and it's so clean inside. The food is out of this world delicious and I love they always give a few extra crab rangoons because those are my favorite! This place won't let you down!"}
{"text":"Super friendly customer service!! The free sample was delicious although I couldn't name it. The owner immediately made me a new dish when I told him the beef was a bit overcooked and I would love to have some authentic Chinese food. I was happy with my food after all. The place is very clean - small but tidy restaurant. Strongly recommend it."}
