{"text":"I really love this place  it's clean and they have almost everything that l need for my Asian cooking and more.  l feel like I'm back home."}
{"text":"Wow! My 100th Yelp review, this one must be special. Island Pacific Seafood Market is one of the cleanest Asian market I've been. I guess it is still new, since they just open few months back. It is a bit smaller than the Seafood City on Maryland Parkway. But their selections r well stock for your basic needs. And the bakery n food court is a blessing."}
{"text":"Love this place, from the ready made varieties to choose from to the delicious rice dessert (specifically the taro and coconut flavored ones). We go here once in a while because it is kind of pricey. We particularly love the chicken skins and the vinegar dipping sauce. My parents enjoy driving 30-40 minutes to get here for the variety of fresh seafood available. We ordered the gutted roasted pig for a family event one time and it was definitely a savory hit.  I have 4 stars instead of 5 due to the pricey packages goods I can find cheaper elsewhere in international good sections as well as the crammed walking space."}
{"text":"So as I was waiting for my fish to be cleaned this older gentlemen was using his bare hands to pick up live crabs. After being bit by one he started to bleed. He then continued to dig through the crabs with his bloody hand. DISGUSTING!!!! We will never come back here again"}
{"text":"Vegetables are not fresh.  The meat and seafood section is ok, just go here because it's close to home but if looking for freshness, it's not a place to shop!"}
{"text":"Loved the grocery store and bakery secretion but the cooked food was just ok. There was lots of fat on the oxtail in the Kare Kare. More fat than meat. The pancit was just ok for me also. The melon drink was really good though."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this supermarket because of the convenient location, but the absolutely disorganized and inefficient way the seafood/meat department was run made me frustrated enough to walk away after over 20 minutes of being ignored. I understand they are busy & short staffed but a simple ticketing system would have solved the incessant cutting in line and waiting, unsure if any worker would eventually notice you to offer service. I was prepared to spend a good sum of money in their store and come back as a regular customer but I am all about service and this place knows nothing about that. I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place gets  ZERO stars!   Went to this Super market and bought brown jasmine rice. I noticed larva inside the bag!  After seeing that, I decided to throw it out, thinking it might be a bad batch of rice....    Went back there trying to give this place a second chance today and bought Bok Choy, Green beans & Salted eggs.   Got home and started to wash the vegetables and found small worms.  So I then I decided to open up the Salted Eggs and as I was cutting into the first one, low and behold, mold inside and in the yolk!.... not just the first one i cut, but the 2nd egg i cut, WAS MOLDY AND WATERY!    At this point, I give up. I go back to the grocery store and approach the cashier and show them the product that they are selling.  The cashier then says, \"sorry ma'am but I can give you a refund\"..... then a couple seconds later she says, \"sorry ma'am, but the only thing we can do is give you an exchange... we will give you another one\". ........wait, WHAT?!?!? DO YOU HONESTLY THINK I WANT ANYTHING FROM YOUR STORE AFTER THAT?!?!  After all this, I've been convinced to NEVER ever shop at this grocery store again... it not only is a health risk.... but IT ISNT SAFE! (even after I  tell the cashier that it wasn't safe, she still found a way to drive me away!)  I guess that didn't matter! This grocery store..... *SMH*..... end of story."}
{"text":"This place just opened recently and gotta say I love it. It's similar to Seafood city. A wide variety of seafood, fresh fruits and vegetables, Asian food products and they also have a bakery and a restaurant. Prices are affordable and customer service is ok. Gonna be going here with my mom more often now that this place opened up!"}
{"text":"Though the supermarket maybe more than adequate, the fastfood section (turoturo) leaves much to be desired. Sadly their pork bbq- meat was tough, more than necessary fat and lacking in taste as compared to Grill City inside Seafood City."}
{"text":"(Review only for market side) A little smaller than other Asian market but also cleaner than most... The aisle are a little narrow so getting around other shoppers was a challenge. Their selections were good. I found everything I was looking for.   A few cons: -A/C was barely working. It was 106F outside that day, so add in the people/crowd, the fish frying/cooking station.. The heat/humidity inside didn't help. -After shopping, there are some bake goods near the door, and a cashier next to the display. After making my selection, I was informed that these items were not part of their menu (it was a little bakery shop inside the market) and I had to stand back in the regular line to purchase them.. I think their display placement was misleading.  Pro: -Clean bathroom -Friendly cashier"}
{"text":"So earlier in the year my mom came to visit and needed some pork for sinigang,  located next to me is either VONs and Glaziers and due to time I did not want to go all the way to Maryland for Seafood City.  The disgust on her face was priceless in Vons as she ripped me apart of \"yes it's great to be healthy and have lean meats, BUT she couldn't do crap with what they had\", we had burgers that night lol.    Short version of review:  Definitely thrilled that this marker opened on the west side of town.  Yay!!!!  Pacific Island  is conveniently located on Durango and Tropicana where Fresh N Easy used to be (for those who keep identifying the \"small\" size of the market).  The market offers all basics and necessities for home cooking, which may I add is great for those like me who unfortunately had to suffice for meats and veggies found at Vons and Sprouts when you don't want to go the distance of the east side.   Produce is fresh, the only thing that looked limited was fruits, but I assume it will vary by season.  Aisles are short but abundantly stocked with all sorts of goods from condiments to noodles to snacks, etc.      Outside the grocery section you will find PhilHouse and Bread Republic.  I have yet to try the bakery, however PhilHouse is awesome!  Portions are plenty and flavors are zesty!  The sisig is my fav as beefsteak is my husbands choice."}
{"text":"This place is ok because it's closer than other Asian markets but it always takes 30 minutes to check out. The only really good thing is the Bread Republic inside the market."}
{"text":"It's a filipino store, i get it. But they cant assume everyone speaks or understands tagalog. There are a few nonfilipinos in the store. The cashier took her time opening a line for me. But then was in a rush to check my items out and when she spoke to me.. It was super fast tagalog. I told her to slow down and then maybe ill understand.   The bakery is cash only. Why? The store and foodcourt accept debit.   Finally got to try the food court. Went here after church. So around 10:45am. Went to get a few things. Most of the people flock to the back to get fish & meat. There wasnt a line at the foodcourt until 11:00am just in time for lunch. They should put names of the food somewhere."}
{"text":"I will not find any food anywhere in the world island pacific can make me so inspired. I love their paksiw na lechon."}
{"text":"So sad that it's your own Filipino store and they don't have good customer service. Like Zero.  Put ur prices correctly on the shelf and don't deceive the consumers. That Butch on the counter is very rude and even says \"u want it or not\" wtf. Freakin cunt"}
{"text":"1. Their combo meals are very affordable. I always get two combo 3 which cost $20-$22. Combo 3 has either rice or noodles (your choice), and 3 dishes.  2. Only few dishes are good tho-sinigang, barbecue, mechado, afritada and kare-kare. The taste of the food is not consistent. Sometimes it's just right but sometimes it's salty, like their tahong. And the ginataang kalabasa at sitaw was sour the last time i ordered. It's weird.  3. Watch out with the breads near the windows. They don't cover the windows from the sun or move the breads from it so at the end of the day you will notice the breads (like packed pandesal) having little dark green dots (amag). I took all those breads, brought it to the cashier and told her about it and she just said ok. I didn't think she cared at all.   Just make it a habit of always checking not just the expiry date but also the product itself."}
{"text":"This Asian/Filipino grocery store well stocked to meet all your cooking needs and they even cook it for you.  Great selection of fish/meats and a deli/restaurant too Located on the southwest of Las Vegas-two other stores opening soon!"}
{"text":"I love coming here with Mom and checking out  all the fish. Good lord do they have a nice selection. I love that there's Filipino food buffet style ready to eat here too."}
{"text":"I'm thrilled that an alternative to Seafood City opened up on the west side of the valley and definitely makes this place very special because it specializes in the mass level of products from the Philippines other then a Chinese supermarket. It may not be as big as Seafood City (east side), but this place definitely looks much cleaner and is well organized. The staff I saw were all Filipinos and that helps a lot! Most Chinese supermarkets staff are Hispanics and some doesn't seem to understand English and I get frustrated when I can't find the product I am looking for. Hahaha!  I agree with the other reviewer that the aisles are shorter than normal, but as long as they have what I need, it's all good! The Sarangani Bay brand of fish are all in one open freezer section and that is so clever! Other supermarkets have them in different places. The seafood and meat area have great selections and seem more fresh than others. The prices are lower here but perhaps due to their grand opening.  This place surely hits the spot from veggies to canned products to satisfy your Asian needs. They also offer short order of Filipino dishes such as combos, all the grilling, and the deep frying goodness! The bakery also gives an added bonus to your one stop shop of fresh baked goodies made in-house. However, it's a small bakery so there may be limited options.  Island Pacific Seafood Market surely makes the Asian grocery market more competitive! And this place makes it on the top of my list! From just being minutes away from my work and IKEA, and easy access to 215, this place deserves great stars!                 Island Pacific Seafood Market,                    you've earned my 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Good produce prices and meat prices! Excited that this is close to where I live. Fresh food and bread bakery area and the fish market offers u the option of getting your fish fries on the spot."}
{"text":"Glad to know that there is a Filipino Supermarket close to home at a nice area. The store is clean and you can find most products a typical filipino needs. However, I gave it 3 stars for the following reasons: 1. \"Beef for stewing\" package is of very low quality. Took 3 hours to cook and you can tell by the looks of it that it is not the best meat part/cut.  2. One of the older man serving at the fish/meat section who weighs and cooks fish products is a pervert and was constantly asking for tips. Though, he makes it sound like that he is joking, he does talk about it each time.  Other than the above comments, I would still shop here due to convenience."}
{"text":"Im fairly new to the city and found this Filipino marketplace. I'd say its a medium sized store compared to other asian stores ive been to. Right as you enter you are greeted with the smells of fresh baked goodies and filipino pastries at their bread republic bakery.  The layout of the market is fairly simple. You start with the vegetables which wrap around towards the back and transitions into the meats and fish. You can choose pre packaged items or get it cut the way you want.  In the middle aisles you have the necessary ingredients and spices for a multitude of dishes. They have a few aisles dedicated to those filipino snack cravings.   In the far side, oppose of the vegetable aisle is the frozen area where youll find tons of ice cream from the philippines.   The marketplace is fairly clean and offers the use of their restroom in the back. Its not the nicest but better than having none.  The checkout lane can get fairly packed since there is only a few lanes available for checkout. Id say about 6 with sometimes 2 or 3 cashiers. The staff has always been friendly since ive gone. Its great to get a feel of my background here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great supermarket, even greater Filipino restaurant inside! Always come here to get my Filipino fix :) They give pretty decent size portions and the cost is low! My boyfriend and I shared a huge combo lunch with chicken adobo, deep fried lechon, dinuguan, and some rice for only $11 bucks! This place is a gem."}
{"text":"It was nice and clean and had all the needs we wanted on the trip.   We had some good as well at their restaurant and it was nicely priced and authentic.   If I'm back in Vegas I will go back."}
{"text":"New Filipino Market that we visited today. For what they are trying to accomplish (just like the Sea Food City and 99 Ranch Market place at Maryland Pkwy), the place is too small. As you enter, there are two different independent tables to the left and right offering you buy their food. One is a Dessert table and the other a Filipino street food table. There is just too much going on in a span of a few seconds as soon as you enter. Instead of observing which areas you'd like to shop at, they have you, forcefully, buy their food. The Dessert table is a like too aggressive (pushy). Being that it's new, the place is clean. We bought food at their eatery, PhilHouse & the food is good. Their Chicken bbq on a stick is superb. The flavor is so perfect, just like how it taste like in the Philippines. The food that I ate is flavored great, balanced and taste just like Mom's cooking. It was just too crowded. There was only 4 registers so the line was long and there was hardly any space to walk about on. We all had to walk sideways to get from one space to the next.  There are a few things that they need to improve on to make this market better. The potential is there. Good luck to this new establishment and I wish all of you the best."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place. It's the alternative to traveling across the city to another seafood market. It has a bakery with hot bread and in many ways surpasses seafood city. It's at Durango and Tropicana and less than 10 minutes from our house."}
{"text":"What a great little find. This is the cleanest Pinoy supermarket I've been to... very neatly-wrapped produce; no leaking styrofoam trays, etc. Big plus is that they're the only Asian market that sells (at least today) fish roe (\"bihud\" in Filipino) - not fish eggs (like caviar) - but the full sac that contains millions of eggs (see photo). They call it \"Buffalo Roe\" (whatever - just glad I found it). Also, it's the only small niche supermarket that I've seen that sells the following: barquillos, Navarro's crab paste and a frozen pig's head. A big plus is that it's a (less than) 10-minute drive from where I live - and I don't have to schlep to Maryland Parkway or fight for parking in Diho/168 Supermarket.  The rest of the groceries you will find in a Diho, or Seafood City, so if you're loyal to those places, then this won't be a tipping point for you - unless you live in the area. Also like other Asian markets, they'll fry your fish for you.   There's also a small food court that sells the usual - Pinoy bbq, fried fish, chicharon bulaklak, etc. - again, very clean, but I have not tried the food, so I don't know if it's any good. There's also a bakery that looks pretty comprehensive.   This is my new fave place of the moment. Note: this is on the corner of Trop and Durango - but on the West side. Same strip mall where Southwest Medical is."}
{"text":"Clean and organized grocery with a bakery (Bread Republic) and restaurant (Phil House, like a food court counter) on site. They also have several sample stations set up when I visited on a weekend.  As the name implies, store stock features a good selection of fish- and they were appropriately priced and fresh, with fairly clear eyes compared to other places in town. Unfortunately, their beef, pork, and chicken options were more limited and somewhat overpriced- they do have traditional sausages like longanisa available.   Their produce section is fresh but also limited, with few herbs available and an emphasis on specialty veggies such as chili leaf and bean sprouts rather than having a selection of tomatoes or more than one lettuce. Some items I thought I should be able to find here were not stocked.  Store staff are around but busy stocking and not particularly able to help you find an item. There are somehow only two cash registers for a shop this size, which is a strange oversight- lines stretched into the dairy section even early in the morning. Bags and anti-bac stations were empty all around the store."}
{"text":"Little smaller than SC and no JB's but I'd rather save myself the drive and go to Island Pacific. Less crowds much much nicer area. The dining is good and very reasonably priced. At this point I can't see a reason to go to SC."}
{"text":"The food counter is so disorganized. There is only one cashier and the line was getting longer people were getting frustrated. Older ladies cutting the line, their own employee cut in front of me to order her food without apologizing or an excuse) even the server didn't seem to take notice.It seems management was not around or care. So don't expect good customer service from this place. Just another flip snobby unorganized place."}
{"text":"I was excited at first to see this new store, but when we got there it was crowded. It was during a Friday but almost every aisle has boxes with an employee unpacking, stacking and pricing merchandise. Why would they do all this during the busy day and not when the store is close, the store is not that spacious to be doing all that and worse part some are chatting and standing around by their boxes. The pastry area could use more space. Food area could use more dessert options, they can just get the egg pies and flan from the front pastry area and sell it by slice. And when I was occupying the restroom, someone keep trying to open the door (3x) even after I said \"hold please\". When I got out I apologize by saying \"sorry\", it was an employee and I know how it feels when needing to use the restroom and needing to get back to work but her face towards me was furious. Employees should have separate restrooms to use that way they don't keep repeating to try to open the door when someone is using the restroom, they only have one restroom/toilet for men and one restroom/toilet for women.   Wish the place can be more spacious and have better supervision if their going to be doing all the merchandise unpacking, stacking, etc., on a Friday, that way customers doesn't get frustrated trying to go through from one aisle to another. And hoping they build a restroom for employees to use that way they don't have to wait on customers and give customers facial expressions.  Enjoy shopping!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great option for all your Filipino foods/ingredients/grocery..especially living on the west side. It's nice to be able to not have to drive far to Seafood City. My only gripe is that this oriental store is a tight squeeze, especially on any given Sunday when families tend to flock and stock up on rations! Aisles are pretty much good for one shopping cart going on way. So expect to be caught in a shopping traffic jam and wait for someone to pull aside for you to over take. Nonetheless it's your typical Filipino grocery store with everything you pretty much need for simple dishes to full blown feast parties. Try their lechon belly...it's dangerously delicious...but caution with moderation hehe"}
{"text":"This is an exciting new little store nestled on the corner of Trop and Durango where the Fresh and Easy used to be. When you walk in, hot and crispy lumpia and freshly made Filipino treats await. Make sure you bring cash if you want to munch while you shop. Otherwise they'll bag up your purchase for you to pay by card when you check out.   Did you know a nice big chunk of fresh Ahi tuna is only $5? Well it is here! I took it home, seared it, sliced it and made three salads just like the ones at cheesecake factory for a fraction of the price. Now that's awesome.   As you walk in further, there's a real open market feel, with hard to find fresh vegetables and full fish with scales in open ice. There was even a boar's head in the freezer section. There were specialty items glore and quite a selection at that.   The only strike against it was the cleanliness of the shelves and the selection of mainstream foods. It would have been nice to pick up some yogurt, but I get it. Places like this are few and far between, and it truly feels authentic. I plan to stop in monthly for a fresh and healthy dinner treat."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here today since they opened and bought some fish, paid for the groceries and was told that I could get my fish cleaned at the back so I went to the back of the store next to the fish rack and gave my fish to be cleaned.  Got my tag and told them I just wanted de-scaled and gutted nothing else.  Well guess what they LOST my fish within 8 minutes after I gave it to them.  LOST my freak-en fish (about 15 inches long weighing about 3 pounds.  Got my money back and said I'll never be back to this small freaking store, I'll go back to International Market way better.  Even the restaurant sucks, I've had way better Filipino food then that."}
{"text":"Island Pacific Seafood Market is where I do most of my Asian grocery shopping mostly because of convenience. It's a much smaller version of Seafood City Supermarket, carrying various Asian grocery items a good number of the Filipino variety. Obviously go to Chinatown for more speciality items.  As soon as you walk in you're welcomed with all these yummy baked goods and desserts. It seems like I always leave with something even when I try to avoid getting anything. It's perfectly located near the cash registers and entrance so it's the first and last thing you'll see in and out of the store.  They have a good selection of seafood and meats. Not the largest selection of fruits and vegetables. Most of the items are reasonably priced. Check their ads items get cheap. They have ube ice cream and ingredients to make halo halo if that's important to you. The aisles are tight and they only have 4 cash registers. I've heard it gets bad when it's busy but luckily I've never experienced it.  If you're not looking into grocery shopping they also have PhilHouse. They serve all kinds of cooked food. The foods actually not that bad. You can either take it to go or dine-in.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's a Filipino supermarket. Little dirty international cheap low grade products and a little pricey. If you're into Filipino products this is the place to go. But it's a little overpriced."}
{"text":"Great place to purchase items from the Philippines, with Filipinos working in this facility. But, they are not very sanitary. I am standing outside of the restroom waiting for my turn to use. Unfortunately, an employee comes out of the single usage restroom without washing his hands. How would I know, the only sink in the restroom was dry as the Sahara Desert. Now mind you, on the mirror, it does state that all employees must wash their hands before returning to work. Maybe it should be in both English and tagalog."}
{"text":"This review if for the belly lechon I ordered. First time for me to order this specialty and they did not disappoint. You picked it up not sliced. It was the hit in the party! Crispy skin and the flavor was awesome. They just made it right. Not salty at all."}
{"text":"It was my very first visit at the Tropicana and Durango store in Las Vegas and it was a very unpleasant one. Under a 8 x 10  was rice for 9.99 and 20 lbs bags of rice. It rang up for 17.99, when I went to show the manager the price they would not honor it, and could not show me where the rice that was 9.99. It was not around the price. She told me I had to look. I ended up leaving everything in my basket and not purchasing anything."}
{"text":"Gave the place 5 stars because they had sooo many different varieties of Sky Flakes! Lol.. Sky flakes are like fancy Saltine crackers. They had different kinds of fillings that I haven't seen available in Jersey, like banana, mango, coconut. They also had ones I was more familiar with, like condensed milk. Place looked pretty clean. And we actually had a shopping cart that wasn't broken down, like when we were in Seafood City. Our cart here had a handle.. haha. It really doesn't take much to make me happy. Items also are geared for Filipino/ Pacific Islander/ Asian shoppers. Just like Seafood City, they have a wide variety of items, produce, meat, and fish. One main difference was their eatery area was smaller. In Seafood City, there were multiple vendors to choose from to get food, and a lot of tables and seating. Here, there was one main food vendor, but they did offer a wide variety of foods that was similar to all the different vendors at Seafood City, and not as much places to sit and eat. I'm assuming most of their customers get their food to go. It was also located in a higher income area of Vegas, as there were significantly more Palm trees and grass here, and the neighborhoods/ homes had more of a California feel. Another reason I gave them 5 stars is because they had lechon belly (pork belly) roasting on a spit above fire. Looked soooo delicious! If we lived here, I would definitely order a whole slab everytime we had a house party. So sad we don't have this place or Seafood City in NJ/NY area! They really should open one up on the East Coast! They would do well over there. Our friends here tell us they have only seen them on the west coast. Sadness! Anyway, definitely a great place to pic up snacks/groceries/yummy Filipino food. ;)"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! How can the manager and their employee double team a customer? Is this how customer service is? So if they allow this when a customer states about their prices, I wonder how they treat their other customers? I also work as a manager and I NEVER WOULD DOUBLE TEAM A CUSTOMER to show that the customer is in the wrong. CUSTOMERS are always right and if a customer believes one thing you just don't double team the customer.   This is bad customer service and also at its worst!   Remember, when you are in a management position you should have respect for your customers and lead by example. If the employee sees this type of involvement with the customer, maybe that manager needs to quit and find something else that is less customer oriented."}
{"text":"I love Asian market and i come here alot. It is always busy. I deducted 2 stars because #1 the isles are narrow and there is not knowing where the line starts when your ready to check out. #2 sometimes there fruits and veggies are a hit or miss kinda thing on freshness. Oh, their food court is pretty good."}
{"text":"They've have bad customer service. I like Filipino food don't get me wrong only if they improve their service. I'm happy to come back."}
{"text":"Finally, a new filipino market on the west side!. Really good selections of cafeteria style filipino food and reasonable pricing for groceries. I spotted some rare delicacies available as well for a steal. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to shop for groceries!  Great selection of fresh seafood. Take a look at their weekly flyer for some great deals. I haven't eaten at the in store for counter but it must be good because there's a line every time I go. Also has a bakery with some sweet and savory items to choose from. Staff is super helpful as well"}
{"text":"New market in town and they have a great selection of fish and produce!!!  Very clean store and staff is knowledgeable"}
{"text":"Being Asian, I frequent Asian markets in Las Vegas.  I have had the chance to compare the selection and prices at IP as well as other markets on Spring Mountain Rd and find that the selection is greater and prices are lower at the other markets.  However, for Filipino items, IP has a far greater selection."}
{"text":"This is an awesome grocery store! It has more than just groceries though - also a grilled food restaurant and bakery nommz within! Households with huge families and mommies who fiend-cook at home might agree.   Dang! I love that they have the pre-cut veggies for Pinakbet/Kare Kare and Sinigang! Tons of veggie variety and island fruits. If you didn't know what jackfruit was, they have a live attraction of this in their fruit section. Sure look it up on web search, but to see it in person is a different experience. To handle the fruit... beware!   Meats of choice, including seafood are all available here. I have yet to make Binagoongan. I dont like the chubby meat; and they have lean selections. What seemed really popular was their jumbo shrimp! Dreamin' of Sinigang. I'll take a stab at it next time. But I'm a broth cheater. I use the sour packets. Also I prefer Catfish Sinigang over shrimp.  Yeah I'm bound to do groceries here again."}
{"text":"nice grocery and nice eatery, as a one stop shop. it's a smaller grocery neighbor place and glad to have one of these closer to my side of town."}
{"text":"This place is a good Asian store. They offer cooked Filipino food and they have a lot of Asian products that are cheaper than other Asian stores. I would recommend this place for your Asian grocery shopping but I would get the vegetables at your local grocery store though  They have lechon (roasted pig) that they sell for $130. I thought it was pretty expensive for something small. I do have to admit it is really good. It's flavorful and so yummy. Must try!   Their chicken inasal isn't really the best. It's okay. It was $7.99 for half a chicken. What I didn't really like was that they drenched it in ginger. You can definitely taste the ginger. It's still flavorful."}
{"text":"My cousin has them cater her baby shower Nd it was pretty good. Only thing I can say is the lumpia wasn't crispy but there was a whole tray. So it may have been the way they reheated them. I'd eat it again!"}
{"text":"This Filipino grocery store is a welcome addition to the southwest valley. The store just opened today and judging from how many cars were in the parking lot, I think this supermarket will be here to stay.  This grocery store is pretty easy to get in and out fast and it is situated at the corner of Tropicana and Durango where the old Fresh n Easy used to be.  The isles are short, but the store is quite wide, so there is plenty of items to choose from.  Of course the staples such as lumpia, tocino, siu bao and Mama Sita's package mixes are all readily available along with many other Filipino items that I have never seen.  They also have a good selection of fish.  There are many items on sale right now, such as shrimp for $3.99/lb and chicken legs for $.50/lb.  You can't go wrong with these prices.  They also have a fast food area where you can have 1, 2 or 3 item combo meals and a good selection of a la carte items as well.  Their bakery shop isn't open yet, but there are quite a few Filipino desserts and buns to choose from at the front of the store.  Definitely worth a visit just to experience what a Filipino supermarket is all about."}
{"text":"Yay! Former Fresh and Easy became a Filipino supermarket!  I'm not Filipino but I love Filipino supermarket because they have all kinds of different seafood. Just like Seafood City on Maryland, this place also had many kinds of seafood. When you get fish (a whole fish with head and tail) in Las Vegas, it's usually not very fresh looking. You can tell by looking into fish eyes. In Greenland on Rainbow, 100% of their whole fish look like they died a couple weeks ago (super old and smelly). This place, I found at least 20% of their whole fish was fresh looking with clear eyes which is very good and very rare to find in Las Vegas. Very nice!! I loved they had live blue crab!! I didn't see live lobster tank here, but I'm sure they 'll put one in soon... (I hope.)  As a seafood lover, this place is absolutely amazing!! You can pick fresh looking fish and bring it to the front and they can clean the fish and grill it for you. Nice!! The grilled squid looked so delicious with the special sauce.  I'm coming back here with a big cooler box!!"}
{"text":"If I eat there I always get sick and my belly always hurt I don't know why?..........:.:"}
{"text":"I go here for the Filipino snacks and dry goods. Be careful of the meat and seafood you buy. Some of the meat looks like it shouldn't even be sold. The bakery has good warm pandesal, their siopao I wouldn't buy again. The only thing, I buy from the lil restaurant is the jeprox."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have a market close to me. More options than driving up and around traffic for filipino eats!!!it was a great idea to add a grill and bake fresh bread, but I just feel they tried to pack too much in this space. Soo good eats, convenient grocery, clean fish to take home... highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place for Asian groceries. Much smaller than the bigger chains like 99Ranch, H-Mart, or Seafood City. I was impressed because it was clean and it didn't smell like ground animal bones or some kinda animal flesh(like how 99 Ranch always smells like whenever we go there). As far as prices, it seems pretty reasonable, if not a little cheaper than the other chains. Great group of employees, very friendly and helpful. Love how they have an eatery that has a huge selection of Filipino food that you crave for! Check them out!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, it's a great addition to the area. The name is a little deceiving though, being that it's not just a seafood market, they have pretty much a grocery store with an emphasis on seafood. The fish counter is pretty nice, lots of whole fish on ice. I didn't really look through the whole store yet because it was crazy busy (opening weekend) and this brings me to the one thing about it that I didn't like... The set up feels terribly cramped and unorganized. When you walk in there's one narrow entrance to the right which is partially blocked by people checking out, and to the left is kind of the same thing so you have a traffic jam right in front. Not to mention the food counter is right there and the line was crazy long so you have all these people jammed up on that side.   It took patience and a pry bar to wedge ourselves through that mess and once in aisles are small and jammed with stuff so brush up on your cart skills as you maneuver though this store. That being said, the selection of stuff looks pretty decent and pricing isn't too bad although I passed on their shrimp because Smiths had larger shrimp for less dough. I think this place will do well, better than the Fresh & Easy that it replaced, simply because this will fill a much needed niche market here."}
{"text":"If there was a zero \"0\" star, that's what I would give the bakery.  The pandesal is the best I've tasted, but they hire people that don't know how to count!!  When I order 2 dozens, I expect 24 pandesal NOT 22.  I'm livid about these two (2) missing bread mainly cuz some customers probably aren't getting the dozen they paid for.  Bread Republic employees don't know how to count!  Becareful and count your pandesals."}
{"text":"We are very happy that they opened up a store here in Spring Valley.  The vegetables and fish are fresh with a lot of variety.  We enjoy coming here to load up on our Filipino groceries.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of its meat market.  It's meat, be it beef or pork is labeled to originate from either Canada, USA or Mexico.....I suppose it's a crap shoot as to where it's from? We buy our fresh meat from Seafood City."}
{"text":"Was so excited about the opening in this area of town (Silverado Ranch area) because of the convenience, but right away got disappointed:  1. The cooked Filipino food is quite awful. Greasy, unattractive presentation (looked like the food's been sitting there for awhile). Expensive almost everything is charged per pound. On their pansit they try to cut corners by using a lot of tokwa vs meat or shrimp ingredients. Be careful of what you order cause their always seems to be an added cost of $.50 for some reason.  2. They put chicken drumsticks on sale for .50 cents and it was so old and nasty like they were diseased, had to dump that.  I'd rather go across the street to Walmart and purchase meat there.   3. Bought pandesal (Zambales brand) the minute you take it out of the bag it shriveled to pieces.  4. Typically for a Filipino business you always expect the process to be slow, but I'm sure one of these days the bakery will open.  Overall management will need to reassess the products that are being sold in order to fulfill customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"i bought sour sap juice that was open. too many flies in the whole place. be careful with buying meat here because my friend's mom bought beef bones here and they were so bad that it stinked up their house. i also had a coworker who bought chicken here and after an hour of cooking it was still pink and he threw it away."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I found Island Pacific had opened near by me. The market is in fair location with great parking spaces. Clean and organized.  They focusing on fresh fishes more than any other seafood, I was a little disappointed since I was looking for live crab, tuna, clam and jumbo shrimp but I only found them in frozen area.  Great varieties of Asian food. Hope they will carry more in the future."}
{"text":"Too small and tight. No room for moving around. Some workers at Seafood area few mens are lazy. Husband felt bad for the old lady weighing seafood because she had a long line and 3 mens are just standing and chit chatting laughing while the old lady is busy. Lazy people are scary. Whats so hard helping a lady weight and stick sticker price on the bag. They even the guts saying to the lady (pati ba naman yan gagawin namin). What an embarrassing attitude. I guess thats how they like to make a living and provide for their family the easy money. Sometimes no matter how tired we are but we have work to do should work rather than complaining because pretty we are getting paid to work not chitchat. Multi tasking thats part of the job description and why we are getting paid. We should be happy that we have a job rather than begging money in the street or relying on the governments help."}
{"text":"I'm glad that there's finally a Filipino Market in the Spring Valley area--and a good one at that. The selection is just as good as any of the bigger Asian supermarkets, good fish, meat and poultry selection and a wide variety of Filipino food, snacks, food supplies and miscellaneous items. Also watch out for when Island Pacific hosts one of those 'sales' because they really throw down with rock bottom sale prices!  PS. This place also houses one of the best bakeries that sells freshly baked pandesal and an awesome 'turo-turo' style cafeteria (PhilHouse) that offers homemade style Filipino dishes that is served with a smile!"}
{"text":"So happy I found this place. It's close to my house and they have everything you may need for Filipino food. I will definitely be shopping here from now on. Totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"A nice and clean supermarket with a complete variety of Filipino food. It is not as big and complete as the other market by Maryland but ur has all the essentials you need. Pricier by 5-10% more too but less hassle due to area is not congested. I would surely come back to shop here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. If you're looking for an asian market this place has everything. If you live close by then you won't ever have to go to seafood city or chinatown for most of the things that you need. They are open at 7 am which is really convenient. Inside there's a little bakery/cupcake place and grill/restaurant which i really appreciate. There's a butcher shop and the fish area. The only thing i didn't like is that they only have 4 registers and no conveyor belt. I hope this place stays busy."}
{"text":"Our first time to try Island Pacific, recommended by family friend, to buy grilled food. I'm really impressed on how clean the store and efficient the staffs are. I ended up staying longer and buying more food as we don't have this kind of store in Santa Monica, CA. Here's a quick summary: GRILLED STORE: food is exceptionally delish! Bought BBQ, grilled pampano, asado, menudo and crispy pata. Super nice staffs and delicious food. Had to control my temptations of buying more but definitely will come back again.  GROCERY STORE: fully stocked with lots of choices and fresh meats and produce. Kids spent time at isle 7, kiddie goodies. I got Manila mangoes and kapampangan tarts. Soooo good! BAKERY: found these very rare ube with leche flan cupcakes, got to buy couple and took the chocolate cupcake with leche flan too. Used to drive 30 miles to West Covina just for these babies.  Will definitely come back again! Love the way the management has decorated the store too. You have to see to believe. PS I definitely deserve a discount for this review, LOL."}
{"text":"Came here to try the Filipino food in their restaurant in this grocery store. The chicken skewer was so good! I got the one item combo and I chose the soup with it. It was delicious. Price was affordable too. I took a tour of the market and I was happy to see them sell okra ! I love okra. I would come here to grocery shop but when I was there it was busy and the line was really long."}
{"text":"This is a Filipino market, so it's of course a great place for seafood! You can eat in-store too; they have a small seating section. Fish is offered grilled (my favorite), deep fried or raw to cook at home. They also offer a variety of grilled meats and typical Filipino food, but I haven't tried that part. Also great for fresh fruit, produce and other grocery items."}
{"text":"An Asian store away from china town with the same cheap prices? Yay. It's a small, packed store, but they have a good deal of the Asian food necessities-sauces, marinades, rice papers and noodles(they sell Louie's noodles!), herbal drinks, sweets- you name it. I will deduct a star because their produce section is very sub-par. You won't find many herbs such as mints. Just the basics here. Deli and seafood both look fresh and are quite affordable. I got too excited when I got to their snack aisle and tried spaghetti flavored corn chips (blech) and vegetarian pork rinds. After grocery shopping, you can grab a bite at Phil's near the front (cheap and filling, but not the tastiest), and some baked goods on your way out. Make sure you have time, though, because the to-go food counter moves extremely slow.  Parking can be annoying when it gets busy, and I can see the check-out lines growing long with only a few cash registers. I'd to stay away during peak hours."}
{"text":"It's smaller than the one in Panorama City, but basically has the same stuff. It's cute though also sell rabbit and frog legs if one is adventures enough to eat those item's."}
{"text":"This place is like Seafood city bit not as crowded.  Still gets pretty busy but not like SC.  This is a grocery geared toward the Filipino crowd but is a good overall Asian grocery store.  Good variety of product.  Prices are fair.  Also serve up some good Filipino food.  Nice clean location and parking can get busy just like SC.  Will come again"}
{"text":"I love coming to this market! The food in the food court is really cheap and they're delicious! Also, they have goldilocks bakery now :) so I don't have to go all the way by seafood city to get my sweet tooth fix ;)  Their snacks are affordable as well"}
{"text":"Really clean Asian supermarket. I'm glad that opened one in this part of town instead of having to go down to Spring Mountain. They have a meat counter where I was able to get some pork belly and beef short ribs. The meat is fresh and service is friendly. Everyone I encountered was actually very helpful and seemed  happy to be there. There's a a Goldilocks Bakery in there that has lots of yummy pastries and cakes too. It used to a Fresh N Easy store so it's not huge and not small. Plenty of frozen goodies available as well such as frozen shu mai (Chinese dumplings) and frozen lumpias ( Filipino style egg rolls ). Convenient! There's even a fast food restaurant inside that I will have to try out next time. Lots of mangos and even fresh whole Jackfruit. Kinda cool not to see exotic fruits in a can.  Give this place a try if you want to expand your cooking pantry. Clean store, friendly staff, and reasonable prices. Will be back."}
{"text":"(review for food counter only) - they have a pretty good spread of food choices but they need to work on their food rating. currently a C rating...eew!"}
{"text":"This is the closest international market to my place. If I ever need ingredients for any international dishes I plan to cook,  this would have to be my go to by default.  Any other place adds at least 20+ mins to my trip.   Place was organized and clean. Prices were high compared to your popular grocery stores i.e. Albertson' s or Von's for items such as bread, milk, produce, etc. But whatever those stores don't have you can buy here i.e. fish sauce, lumpia wraps, etc.  Fyi, right in front of the supermarket there are parking spots marked for the animal hospital adjacent to them. Even though those spots are closer to seafood city,  do not park there. Someone left a couple shopping carts behind my car probably because of that even though there were multiple free parking spots for the hospital that were vacant. But I could just be trippin."}
{"text":"I disregarded all negative reviews of this spot. This place is awesome! One thing about certain yelp reviewers, especially when it comes to reviewing Filipino/pacific stores/restaurants, is that they often have a personal high standard and expect some sort of common american-ish style and outlook. It's so \"homey\" here. They've got all types of groceries from the Pacific; from snacks to fruits, to even sugar cane sticks. One of the best places to eat at too. They have a Filipino restaurant inside. They serve a huge breakfast plate for only $5 (plus tax). Get off your high horses and support more businesses like this. It's so awesome to have an Asian/Pacific Islander grocery market on this side of the city."}
{"text":"I was excited to find out that a Filipino market near where I live was opening.   Been here twice and will definitely be back. The supermarket has a lot of variety. One good thing I like about this place is that you can buy fish, have them clean it and fry it as well. I love eating fish but hate the smell of it when you cook it at home.   They also have a fast food place where you can buy cooked food and eat it there too. My husband's favorite is their chicharon bulaklak.   Next time, will try some of their local delicatessen. Filipino kakanin like suman sa lihiya, puto, mamon, ensaymada, banana cue and so much more.  So many to mention, definitely a must see and try. Only thing though is that a bit crowded as they try to pack in as much stalls they could."}
{"text":"They got everything most Filipinos need. No more long drive to seafood city. Fresh fish and meat, veggies and a lot more. They also have a fast food  and a Bakeshop that will open soon. Thank you Island Pacific"}
{"text":"I'm just frustrated because when I called the store this morning to ask them for the price of mochi, they told me that it was 2 for $7, but when I got there and I told them I was quoted this price, they did not honor it. They looked at me as if I was lying. Horrible customer service. I am so disappointed because I so wanted to love this store."}
{"text":"Their fish, pork, are not fresh. So be Leary. Also they are expensive compared to others like Kusina."}
{"text":"*Nice wall decorations  *clean *new *good selection of produce *competitive prices  (at least for now, during grand opening) *philhouse restaurant & a turo-turo (point-point) eatery line-up upon entry.  When I lived in Vallejo I liked this place better than seafood city, because it was better priced and closer to home as is the case still, just now here in vegas. I'd give this place a 4 star if: *one skinny shopping cart didn't take almost the whole aisle way *didn't have extra items for sale, displayed on boxes in the Isle way making the space even more narrow. *the meat area was so chaotic and unorganized. my wife wanted some fish fried and the 1st butcher directed her to the middle station. As soon as she gets there she tells me the butcher immediately starts talking to her in tagalog and my wife isn't pinay. Then everyone starts jumping ahead of her so rudely and the guy doesn't care and just goes on about his business and blows my wife off while she is trying to ask him for further assistance and find out if she's in the right section since he's  just going ahead with the other customers behind her. I hope they can work on this, because we would really like to support this part of the market too. *the checkout counter at this supermarket is supersmall, to where you have to wait for the cashier to ring up enough stuff, so you can put the next items on, and once on, you have to manually push them through or hand it over because it is that small, where there's no automatic belt. On top of that is the container of Toblerone  (a chocolate fave of my people I notice) amongst other things that you or the cashier have to push around to make room, kinda like that old skoo plastic game that has numbers on squares jumbled up and you have to shift it around with your fingers to get them back in numerical order (hopefully I didn't just date myself here:("}
{"text":"Went there yesterday to eat and it was small and cramped. The food line ran in to the check out line as well as the store entrance. Hopefully they will re organize a better plan for this store. It seemed that the ladies serving the food didn't portion the food equally n some was skimpy for the price. There was this one lady serving was so rude saying things in filipino and thought i couldn't understand, so i replied to her in english and she was shock. I'm not filipino but, i grew up with a lot of them back home in Hawaii and I'm glad the ones back home are nothing like the one i encountered yesterday"}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 72/100  We usually come here to get frozen tako (octopus) to make Tako Poke.   It's a lot like Seafood City but smaller yet designed well and in a more convenient location.   They have a good variety of fresh vegetables, seafood and Filipino snacks, ice cream and the usual stuff you would find in a Filipino grocery market. Definitely more options than the tiny Filipino markets popping up all over town.   The design definitely makes the space feel smaller than when it was a Fresh and Easy market but they don't need that much space. I like how they have more than enough space for a bakery (Bread Republic - fresh pan de sal) and a quick serve restaurant, Philhouse.   There's usually a line at the registers but the cashiers are fast and friendly so you don't have to wait too long.   Prices are fair and I'd rather go here than Seafood City, less traffic and always good parking and friendly service. I can't wait for their Silverado Ranch location, even better for me!"}
{"text":"They have all types of fish. They will clean it and fry it for you. Any type of meat you can think of!! Check this place out !!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for some food (PhilHouse) with my fiancee who's 2nd generation Filipino-American. He doesn't know any Tagalog. When the server asked him what he wanted and he couldn't understand what she was saying she rolled her eyes at him before answering in exasperated English. WTF. If you can't treat your customers with respect you have no business being in the service industry. Learn to deal with the diversity that's here or bumalik sa kung saan ka nanggaling."}
{"text":"We stopped by to pick up dinner from the in store cafeteria. We brought pork belly, grilled squid, pancit, and pork kabobs. We also picked up some sweet deserts. Everything were delicious. We plan to return to try more goodness from the cafeteria."}
{"text":"I just bought food at Phil House and the beef steak I got is old they just re heat it from last night and the Manager Juliet say it was just cook why is it taste funny and meat is falling apart and smell."}
{"text":"The Filipino population in Las Vegas has exploded in the past decade including other Asian groups. This market is located in an area where there is a surge of grocery items that one can find when needing Filipino and Asian products on the West/Southwest side of Las Vegas. What you'll come across once you enter:  1) Bread Republic- Filipino style bakery with hot and fresh Pandesal (Traditional Filipino Dinner Roll).  2) PhilHouse- Quick Service Restaurant (like a Filipino style Panda Express)  3) Fresh Fish and Seafood section (Cleaning Service and Frying)  4) Produce (Vegetable staples and popular veggies for certain Filipino dishes).  5) Canned and Vaccum sealed items that are popular among Filipinos and Southeast Asians.  Overall the market was clean and organized. The staff was friendly and helpful just overwhelmed because its been busy every day. Compared to Seafood City, Island Pacific is smaller and could use more open space. The main reason why I didn't give them 5 stars unless they expand into Tuesday Morning.  FYI: A good portion of the products comes from the Philippines but you can find items from China, Taiwain, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan."}
{"text":"Huge selection , great menu items. Great pan de sal. But the food always seems to be inconsistent. The service at the bakery is so so. Today the service at the bakery was just terrible. I wanted to order some pan de sal and the lady said it was gonna take 30 minutes, so I got a bakery ticket so I could pay at the grocery cashier. Then I made sure that I took my time to look around to kill time for 30 minutes so I could get fresh pan de sal. 30 minutes went by and I went to pay for everything and when I went to get my pan de sal the freaking Filipino lady didn't even put the shit in the oven yet. So I had to get a freaking refund. Wtf! Wasted my time."}
{"text":"Standing in line ordering food. Noticed the employees were real friendly to all the Asians in front us. And when it got to is they were not friendly at all. And told me there was no pancit, as if I didn't know what it was or what it looked like. And it was right in front of us. Very uncomfortable and don't like being treated differently from others"}
{"text":"Went there last weekend, cant even move around because its so tight, its just frustrating shopping here and theres not enpugh cash registers. The Frozen suman is old. The ready made food like the dinuguan is full of fats, terrible food. The only thing I like are the fresh fish. The ready made food are should just be a to go food, those damn tables are a waste of space.  Seafood City is still the best."}
{"text":"My first experience at this grocery store! My cousin in law was always telling me to check it out and so I did. I thought it would be bigger but it's a small size market. Once you walk in, they have a mini bakery on the left side. You hit the vegetables first and they had a little selection but fresh for an Asian market. I bought fish and some meats here. Pretty good quality. They have an amazing snack selection! Like 2 aisles? I was like.. JACKPOT!!!! Happy dance for the fried garlic slices they had, amazing selections of chips and chocolates. For small aisle, I spent forever there lol. I was there for an hour just looking around and seeing what they have. When you check it out inside, you'll be like \"what?! How did she stay there for an hour?! Lol\" seriously!!! Imagine me at target though. Haha anyways! I would definitely go back. They have great deals on Filipino Banana Ketchups, 4/$5, Soy Sauce was 2/$5 and other different sales. I love it! I'll go back for snacks. The registers are tiny though! So for all you shoppers who love to fill their carts like me.. be prepared to unload and load. They don't have people helping you on that. Bring a buddy! Lol.. you'll know what I'm talking about. Happy shopping!!"}
{"text":"If you are searching for authentic Asian food to cook at your condo while visiting Las Vegas, this is the place to get the real deal!  Take a peek at what I found and took pics of while shopping at this grocery store!  Poor parrot fish!"}
{"text":"Not particularly clean, and the bananas I got weren't very good--already ripe and bruised. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This is completely unsanitary, and the fish was stored inappropriately. I asked the store manager, if they could do something about the fish because it was submerged in room temperature water. He seemed annoyed, and didnt uphold health standards. He ignored my request to check the seafood aisle, and just continued doing his inventory. I waited there for 48 minutes and still no results. Im upset and dissatisfied with the service they provided. My mom wanted some fish but i cant risk her health, from the food they sell."}
{"text":"i used to come here for their freshly baked yummy (BIG) pandesal. not only it's gotten a lot smaller, the price has doubled too!! so disappointed! never going to buy pandesal here ever again!! im going back to valerios!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Asian grocery stores. I love the selections of fresh fruit, vegetables, fish and wide range of rices. Today I bought some Lemons and you can see they are truly picked from trees, because their skin looks different and their smell is just real without any pesticides. I also buy their flour sticks, noodles, sweet chili sauces and teriyaki sauces for cooking. I just love them. Fresh bakery goods are here from Bread Republic, my favorite are cream cheese rolls and their pan de Leche is PRETTY GOOD! If you got hungry while shopping they have a restaurant here inside with fresh grilled meats and fish while serving with noodles, rice and other favorite dishes. Customer service is good and store clean."}
