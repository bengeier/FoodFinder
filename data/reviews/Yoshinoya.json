{"text":"Food was great!
First time trying this place out for lunch and definitely won't be my last. 
Service was friendly. 
Will recommend this place to friends and family. 
I had the chicken teriyaki plate I believe.
Great job"}
{"text":"I wouldn't venture off the strip, but \"The Bachelore\" of our group required a visit to Yoshinoya.  

He lives in Chicago and whenever he ventures to the west coast, he seeks out a Yoshinoya.  I have never been to a Yoshinoya in the states.  The only time was in the location across from the Kabukicho gate.  That experience was three stars.  Meat was decent and cheap.

However, this experience at this Las Vegas location was disappointing.  The sesame chicken wings tasted fresh enough, but I had to force myself to consume the beef bowl with vegetables.   Uhm, the iced tea tasted fine. :)

I always describe the meat as \"wet bacon\" on overcooked rice.  It was spot on.  More fat than meat.  Rice was clumpy and fat with water.  

To top it off, it was a $26 cab ride there from the strip (back and forth) and my buddy bought THREE large beef bowls to bring back to Caesar's.  I had to give it two stars since my buddy was smiling with MSG drool for the next three meals.  ack!

Only the best for \"The Bachelore\"."}
{"text":"Executive Summary: Food's not great, but it's quick, it's really, really, really cheap, and it fills you up.  Did I mention it's cheap?

No, Yoshinoya isn't the greatest food.  It's not haute cuisine.  In fact, it's probably just barely edible, but when you consider the price/value proposition, Yoshinoya should be on the top of your fast food list.  How much does a value meal at your typical fast food restaurant cost?  Probably $5-6 (depending on what size you'd prefer your cholesterol delivery system).  For $6, you can get a crappy burger, fries, and a soda.  What can you get at Yoshinoya for $6?  You can get a steaming bowl of rice, topped with hot beef and onions, a dessert, and a soda.  If you could go without the soda and desert, you could walk away from Yoshinoya spending less than $4.  It's a great bargain.  Yes, the chicken has the same texture as the styrofoam container it's served in, but it's still more fulfilling than a Big Mac.

If you're on a budget, and you're in a hurry, and you're sick of burgers, go to Yoshinoya and you'll think twice about ordering a value meal ever again.  Bonus: UNLV students get a $3.99 beef/chicken bowl and soda.  Bring your student ID."}
{"text":"I crave this stuff.....

Every time I go to Vegas I eat here as much as I can. That's saying a lot since the casinos are more then happy to comp all my meals.

I always have the beef bowl. No chicken bowl, no vegetable bowl or anything else. Just the beef bowl.

I'm not sure why some people don't like it but I love it. I think about for weeks before I get to Vegas."}
{"text":"Came into his location  for lunch with my boyfriend and daughter. We got the Angus  beef plate with walnut shrimp.  Which was good. Then the beef bowl & Angus beef bowl. Which I order the Angus plate so they got that wrong. And there beef bowls are very nasty idk what kind of beef it is. It taste nasty no seasons. This will be the first n last time here. Thanks but no thank you..."}
{"text":"Been eating Yoshinoya since I was little, Im originally from CA and I was stoked to see that one was finally opened here in Vegas! Despite the tricky location and somewhat raised prices, the food is still great (with a slight different taste) but I LOVE this place! Nothing beats a good beef bowl.. :)"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that as a California native I was super excited that Yoshinoyas opened up here in Arizona. I will be totally honest with everyone, Yoshinoyas is not for everyone.  I really believe that you have to be raised around this restaurant to appreciate the love. In a city ruled by tacos and burgers, Yoshinoyas is a beautiful alternative for me. I have tried many Japanese restaurants out here in the valley and they dont even come close. There have been plenty of times that I traveled back to Los Angeles and my first stop has always been the Yoshinoyas in San Bernandino before I begin my vacation. That's how much I love this restaurant.                               Much love to Yoshinoyas and go Dodgers......"}
{"text":"The food is great for fast food. The beef bowl is great and comes with veggies. It would stick to their beef bowl as their chicken wasn't spectacular."}
{"text":"I went to pick-up some dinner last night from yosh and found a note on the dorr from the lessor stating they elected to take control of their space. So, NO more yosh in AZ : ("}
{"text":"I feel really bad reviewing this fast food Japanese restaurant.  I mean, someone did believe in this business venture and invested their hard earned money into this place.  

Here goes nothing:

My family and I proceeded to go in the restaurant and there was this Asian lady standing near the front door, not sure if she's trying to attract people on the street to eat in her restaurant or what, we found that abit odd, so anyway, we walked in and the place is EMPTY...at this point I want to leave and I already have a preconceived idea of this eatery, if this really is a Japanese restaurant, I think not!

I wasn't feeling well that day, so I wanted Miso soup, about 5-8 minutes later, here it was before me, a watered down, scallions galour  floating on top, and little bits of soy on the bottom of the bowl.  As I was staring at this bowl of soup in front of me, I was reminded of a place called Happy Teriyaki outside of Fort Lewis in Tacoma, Washington that my hubby always took me for lunch, oh how I miss that right about now...I sipped my soup a few times, and seriously, I had to stop.  It wasn't very good.

In the the mean time, my husband and my son ordered a combo chicken and beef with veggies...they also mentioned that it wasn't bad, but its certainly not good either.  As a family, we were all in agreement that we weren't coming back anytime soon.  

Sorry Yoshinoya...  : ("}
{"text":"Bad service, waited on my order around 30 mins, counter person kept mixing the orders. Rude service. Zero stars!!"}
{"text":"This place is just OK for me. I do not understand the fascination with this place. The meat is a little too thin and mashed up for me. The sauce is way too watery for me. I do appreciate the price on their meal combos. It is very affordable. If you are on a tight budget then this place is for you. 

This place used to be a WENDY'S"}
{"text":"Does anybody know why this place closed? This was the last Yoshinoya in Nevada. Now I have to drive down to California.The food was quite declious, but not sure why it closed?"}
{"text":"The food was not too bad. A little bland and I feel a bit over priced for what you get. I hit this place up at noon at it was dead inside. The seating area just feels like it's lacking in decorations of some kind. The staff were nice but the service was slow."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Nothing to go out of your way to get. Had a chicken teriyaki bowl and a beef bowl with a 6 piece gyoza to share. It would have been better to go to Aloha Kitchen for the chicken teriyaki. It seems that Yoshinoya is missing out on dimensions of flavor. We are not sure that we will be back as we were not overly enthusiastic about what we ate."}
{"text":"YES? it was a great place. YES, it is closed. I saw some one asked why. I got the chance talked with owner when they moved out. The owner said that few people like this place, it is not making any money , so he decided to close it."}
{"text":"Closed; Yoshinoya closed their only restaurant here in Arizona and broke my heart! How I miss the Yoshinoya of Los Angeles. Santa Monica Blvd and Vermont or the 2 on Wilshire; one in K-town and the other at Alvarado in McArthur Park District.  I miss you Yoshinoya. Please come back. Your food is excellent ; )"}
{"text":"Great food. I really like the beef bowl. Lots of siting area. But there is something missing. \"The walls\", there is lots of windows but the walls are missing decorations. It looks like you eating in a box."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place and it was better than I thought it would be! The Orange chicken and beef plates were so yummy! Definitely coming back here! Everything was fresh"}
{"text":"Satisfying my every-five-year craving for a beef bowl. Also gotta have the chicken wings."}
{"text":"Don't know why people like this place so much.  Got the beef bowl that people were raving about on here.  It came with some vegetables that were obviously low-quality frozen ones.  The beef was tender, and I don't mind that it was thin, but it was almost all fat.  The miso soup tasted like water, none of the salty/savory flavor that usually makes it good."}
{"text":"Mmmmm! Yoshinoya!!
This place is delicious! 
I've been going for years in LA and was soooooo happy when they made one here. 
I adore both the beef and chicken teriyaki bowl. I can't figure out which I like best. So what to do? Get both with the combo bowl. 
The beef is soooooo delicious. I like the beef better than the chicken but the teriyaki sauce on the chicken is heavenly.
I also tried the yakisoba recently and it was so good. I'm getting it more often. 
I love everything about this place but my favorite thing here is the creamy cheesecake. OMG that thing is good. It's my absolutely favorite dessert on earth. I usually get two or three to eat later."}
{"text":"Couldn't eat meat for religious purposes the day I went, only ONE seafood option. Ordered it. It turned out to be spicy as hell!  When my boyfriend went to ask if he could order one with \"no spicy\" the register woman told him it wasn't spicy, and it went back and forth with her (\"spicy, no spicy\")  for a while until he said, \"do you want to taste it!? all i want to do is buy another filet with no spicy\" and she said that they had no filets that were not marinated. so, I ended up eating miso soup and rice... the food was okay according to my boyfriend, who had chicken and beef terriyaki, and ultimately... my spicy filet. I guess, what could I expect. Should have gone to a non fast food place."}
{"text":"i have been craving this place for years since moving from california to georgia.  now i am back on the westcoast i found the one and only yoshinoya in las vegas.

let me start off by saying the prices are extremely high compared to california prices.  you may as well go to a japenese restaurant and sit down and you probably would come out cheaper.  none the less i won't go here as often as i would like because of the high prices.

but in spite of the prices the food was deeeelicious.  of course the food was fresh and the beef was so tender and good.  the service was pretty good and prompt.  it was kind of crowded so i guess everyone was having a craving like i was or needed to get out of this 115 degree weather today."}
{"text":"Holy crap.  Nicest Yoshi's that I've ever frequented.  

Modern decor and easily accessible from Maryland Parkway.  Right across the street from UNLV --- lucky bastards.  

Atmosphere was great, but the Bowl itself was OK.  Rice was a bit dry --- not as moist as other Yoshi's.  But I'll take it.  Cheap, sweet beef.  I can't complain.  

Showed up on a Thursday at 11:30 a.m.  Not crowded at all."}
{"text":"CRAP! The other reviews are idiotic (sorry, but it has to be true, since this is crap!)  Over priced - over sauced - horrible place. Oh, and very dirty.  

You have been warned - enjoy!"}
{"text":"I suppose if I was REALLY homesick, I'd like this place.  The rice was terrible, and the vegetables were foul--just like my mother makes them.  For not much more than the same price I can go across the street to East Boy and get a decent chicken bowl with green beans, seaweed salad and nice rice.  Yoshinoya is the first place around UNLV that I won't bother to return to."}
{"text":"I'm originally from California. So to find a yoshinoya near unlv is amazing. The first time I came here, yes it was very outdated. I came here for lunch today and it has been completely remodeled. Very modern and clean. $7 for a beef, chicken, and vegetable bowl is a steal. Idk why yelp says it closed on days it's not. So call ahead"}
{"text":"Been eating yoshinoya since I was 5 that's 20 years ago I love yoshinoya in Cali wtf is this their very stingy with the ginger here!! Hate it don't recommend I rather drive to Cali. Plus they give small amount of meat it's mostly rice and the price increase man I'm so disappointed and I love yoshinoya not this one"}
{"text":"The beef & veggie plate is nostalgic for me...

When I was going to OCC I lived off of this stuff. I would buy a large beef bowl & make three meals out of it because I was broke. Every time I have Yoshinoya it takes me back to that time & I think of how far I've come so it's not just about the food but it's also about the memories. 

This stuff has such a distinct taste & it hasn't changed in years which I love. It's cheap, filling & delicious. The beef is extra thin & I love the flavor! The veggies are a must for me because they are always perfectly cooked & I pour some soy sauce over everything & it doesn't get any better :)

There's one location in town which sucks & I'm waiting for the day it comes to the west side :)

Worth driving across town for this stuff? My answer is absolutely!"}
{"text":"Anytime I can find a Yoshinoya I am there!! I am kind of a proponent for this place.. I don't know exactly why i love it so much, but I seek them out when I can find them. We don't have them in AZ, so I usually go out of my way when I am out of state to find one. You have to get the chicken and beef combo bowl. So good.. I am hungry for it right now!"}
{"text":"Good fast food but this location does not take coupons!
Also bit hot and humid inside."}
{"text":"Used to eat Yoshinoya when I was in college. Miss those good old days! Anyways, the food was little off. It didn't taste like the beef bowl I used to have in Southern California. I couldn't tell what was it but it just didn't taste right.  Also, the employee was taking my order decided to just disappear??? Another employee finally jump in and finish taking my order. That was the most awkward moments in my life."}
{"text":"I am just glad to have this Yoshinoya nearby and appreciate it's existence here in Arizona. Being from SoCal it is just one of those places you enjoy having around. In SoCal you might not find people giving Yoshinoya a whole lot of Hype... but trust me they love it! I usually get the Beef and Chicken Combo(add Beef broth on top of beef and rice Excellent!) really good! I understand Yoshinoya might not be for everyone... but as for myself I do enjoy my bowl time and time again!"}
{"text":"Disgusting Food, terrible service. They close at 10, i came in at 9:25 and their faces be like \"why the f ur in here at this hour?\"... The udon dish felt like i was swallowing salt down my throat. The beef dish was made w flank which is the cheapeast kind of beef out there. I ended up throwing the food away after 20 minutes struggling figuring out what the hell are these stuffs i been swallowing. I exit and the lady who took my order just stare at me didnt even say thank you. Im also a server and i was like \"how the hell did u get hire?\" Strongly not recommended. Worst restaurant i ever eat at"}
{"text":"I was soooooooooooo drunk.  Cheapest thing I did in Vegas was buy a beef bowl.  

I don't care what anyone says. I used to hit up Yoshinoya's whenever I was in SoCal.... emerging from a smoke-filled car, and I'll continue to come here,  inebriated every time.

4 stars.... minus 1 star because I'm not an alcoholic or drug addict. This is definite tweaker food."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible beef! I ordered two combo plates and a large beef, the beefs were 90% fat I would had demanded a refund if I wouldn't have lived so far away. I loved this place in CA when I was growing up. A coworker told me there was one in Vegas I was so happy! I ordered our families food and took it home, when I got home I was mortified we threw it out. I still can't believe how disgusting the beef looked, I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt but it was like chewing half cook fatty bacon, do yourself a favor and skip this place $27 in the trash."}
{"text":"\"Airline food\", that's what my wife equated our dishes it to.  
This has to be the worst new opening on the westside in a long time!
Fatty chicken, tracing paper thin cut beef in our combo was less than desirable to say the least.  

Sorry Yoshinoya, but you have seen us the one and only time in your resturant."}
{"text":"Delicious just like I remembered as a kid. Fast and friendly service. So glad Vegas had a location."}
{"text":"Never go to this location. Went there last Tuesday around 9:30 pm with a group of 12 people & young kids to grab a quick bite to eat. As soon as we got there the cashier named Alfonsina said it was for to go orders only. Mind you that this place doesnt close till 10pm. There was another family ahead of us & they ordered and sat to eat there dinner in one of the booths. Thats when the rude cashier agreed we can stay & eat in but in one condition only in certain spots.  3/4 th of the eating area was already cleaned with the chairs stacked on top of thr tables. There were other customers coming in & she turned them away. I dont think the owner would appreciate that. While we were eating Alfonsina was mopping around our area with the strong scent of pine sol. I thought that was disgusting but I guess it was alright for Yoshinoya establishment to add scents to their food. To make this visit even worse the same rude cashier, cleaning girl Alfonsina announced to our group it was 10:00 & there closed. She kicked us out & we didn't even finish our food. We had young kid's & they didnt get to finish there dinner too. Our bill for this horrible dinner was $75, I think Yoshinoya should give us time to finish. Alfonsina was so eager to get us out she even touched our food cartoons to throw away. I repeat NEVER go to this Yoshinoya in Las Vegas off of Maryland. Especially when Alfonsina is on."}
{"text":"Too bad this is the only Yoshi in town. This place tastes just like any other Yoshi, so that's good, but you can tell the owner is a cheapskate.  Tip jars at fast food joints always irk me. They've got one here. Then they took away the Sriracha bottles, then the ginger. Now you have to ask them for the ginger. And I love ginger so when we asked for 3 containers for two bowls, I could tell the girl didn't want to give us more than one each. We did use all of it though. Next I'm sure the soy sauce and pepper will be taken away too.

Also the prices here are higher than what I remember them being in CA. $8 a bowl (large).

But another plus is they do offer a free regular size bowl for your birthday with the purchase of a drink."}
{"text":"Contrary to what Chheng L. thought, Cali people aren't the only ones who appreciate Yoshinoya. New York peeps also love it! My friends and I used to eat at the Yoshinoyas a lot when I was working in NYC, and the places were almost always packed. And no wonder - the food is good and cheap, and the service is fast. The main drawback (for me) for this lone franchise in AZ its distance from Phoenix; but even that isn't so bad, as it is one minute from the Dysart Rd. exit of  I-10. Still, I wish they'd open some franchises in Phoenix itself. And Chheng L was right -- pouring the clam chowder into the beef bowl sounds crazy but I found it to be yummy when I tried it.  However, if you've never tried the beef bowl before, try it by itself first. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times which was once a Pizza Hut with a pizza buffet.  I miss those Pizza Hut buffets where can I find one huh?

First I'll review Yoshinoya as a chain.  Not a big fan of super thinly sliced meat unless it's in a sandwich or in a broth dish like pho. Which is what I got with the Teriyaki chicken with vegetables bowl. I should've gone across the street to Aloha Kitchen for their Teriyaki chicken bowl.  I think I paid more for what I got.

There was once a so called knockoff of Yoshinoya in town, not so far from here Yoshi something, before this location opened up.  That place was way better but it eventually closed down.  This location does seem run down.  The condiments area was completely empty, there was only an almost empty container of pickled ginger that didn't look pleasing. There wasn't even any soy sauce or salt and pepper dispensers. The napkins in the dispenser were all wet and counters need cleaning.  For decoration there's a few UNLV items on the walls. They could use a renovation."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day. Got the beef bowl. It was good though the meat was a little fatty. I like Yoshinoya because it has atypical fast food (I.e., not the standard burgers or tacos)."}
{"text":"I was on the Strip and remembered there's a Yoshinoya not too far away. I had a weird, nostalgic craving for it. I grew up eating beef bowls in L.A. when I was young. I would eat it before or after clubbing in Hollywood. I would get smack from my husband, my sister, and a few friends for liking this stuff. Hey, we all have our embarrassing fast food likes!

So this is my second time coming to the Vegas location. I ordered two large beef bowls. I never liked the fluorescent veggies. I ate one bowl there and took the other bowl to go to eat the next day. It was alright and not as good as I remembered them. I had the same thought the other time I came here.

The next day, I reheated them. It wasn't good. I felt gross after. I would not recommend eating it the next day. I guess my taste buds have changed. I don't think I'll be craving this for a while.

Also, it's kinda ghetto here. I was trying to eat as fast as I can so I can get out of there. I was too hungry to take it to go."}

OK Y'all, so I'm not sure why the ratings for this place are so low. 

This is certainly not 100% equivalent to the ones in Japan, but I keep myself from reviewing sushi places in SF by comparing them to ones in Japan. 

So.... 
A lovely warm beef bowl (regular size) sets you back less then $5 here. That, plus a soda, and you're set for a meal and half, if not more. 

Side order options (not very OG): 
Macaroni Salad (odd, not an option in japan) 
Cheesecake 
Caramel Flan
Chocolate Cake

From an excerpt from the Japan Times: 
\"It was delicious,\" said Tadashi Ishigami, 23, one of the first to mark the return of the dish, downing a bowl at an outlet in Tokyo's Yurakucho district. \"I don't care (about the safety of the beef) as long as I can eat it.\"

You see, there was a momentary ban on US Beef (insert joke here) to Japan back in 2006, and GyuDon returned to its glory days in Fall of 2006. 

But I digress. 
Sure, they should add curry rice. Sure, they should be open 24 hours and have these orange 'noren'/curtains that welcome you thru the doors. But they don't, and that's okay. 

Gyu-don of my childhood, available in Rasu Begasu. 
But not in SF. (-_-) 

Oh, and yes, the dorktastic part of me spent about 10-15 minutes looking at the black and white photos of yoshinoya shops in the early 1900s. 

Whenever I drive past one of these.. the old commercial runs thru my head.. 

Nice to Know Ya, Yoshinoya!

I think there's one in San Jose... road trip?

{"text":"Been here multiple times and always get the same thing. The beef bowl with side of extra beef and onions. So good!"}
{"text":"Yoshinoya has a certain flavor that I cant seem to find in any other teriyaki place. I have tried pretty much everything on their menu and I gotta say, I it is all decent. The only thing negative that I can say is that their veggies are a bit starchy. Other than that, their own special blend of cayenne spices and pickled ginger gives your meal that extra flavor. 

This location is pretty spacious and they keep it pretty clean, including the bathroom.
This is the only Yoshinoya in Vegas compared to dozens in Southern Cali. There used to be another location but that was closed down due to I assume not enough business."}
{"text":"I guess its a Cali thing because no one but us Cali peeps appreciate its existence. I was super excited when this location opened up. I will drive from Chandler to satisfy my Yoshinoya craving. Yes, I think it's really that good! It's my guilty pleasure that my BF (who is an AZ native) doesn't quite understand either. 

Ohhhh the beef bowl... this is not suppose to be teriyaki people! It's Gyudon! Made with dashi, mirin and soy sauce and I freakin' love it. I have gone so far as google-ing the recipe and making it at home. My attempts have been pretty sucessful! But not quite the same because I'm missing one thing... the Clam Chowder! I love ordering a beef bowl and clam chowder and pouring the soup over my beef bowl! Yup, over my beef bowl! I know, sounds gross, but trust me... try it! My LA peeps and I have been eating it this way for a while and everyone we have convinced to try this concoction have converted to eating it this way as well. It's ends up kind of like a casserole. lol. Don't forget to top it with some bright red beni shoga (ginger) and red pepper!

Clearly you can see my appreciation for this one Yoshinoya in the entire state. From the beef bowl, to the clam chowder, the sesame wings, the chicken salad and even the glow in the dark veggies (as my friends and I would joke)... I really like this franchise. I just wish they had more locations in the state and closer to where I live."}
{"text":"I love how there's only one yoshinoya in Vegas because I get to appreciate it so much more when I finally get to have it! It's always been on point here as far as service and quality goes. I've never had to wait that long for my food or to order and they always have all the condiments as far as the peppers, soy sauce and ginger filled. Their rice is cooked just right every time and their veggies always look and smell so good. I normally order the combo bowl and both the beef and the chicken is cooked just right and tastes so comforting! I also love how they have the peach iced tea in their fountain and I'm not much of a sweet tooth but their flan is a must! :)"}
{"text":"Yoshinoya was always one of my Los Angeles favorites for the beef and/or vegie bowl. Real simple concept and the thin shaved marinated beef placed on top of a bed of rice has always been tasty. This location is a few miles from the strip in a questionable neighborhood where alcohol abuse (panhandling drunks)surrounding the restaurant was noticeable. Food was just ok and below the standards set at the LAX area locations. Restrooms could use a little more cleaning attention."}
{"text":"The first time I walked into this McDonalds of Japan was after a Frat party at University of Southern California.   I don't know if I was drunk, but some how this bowl tasted like the best thing I ever ate, and was hooked thereafter.   During my stay in Southern California, I often drove 20 miles just put down a combo bowl.  Then I moved back to Hawaii, and sadly, Hawaii doesn't have any franchises of this company which totally weird, because there enough Japanese tourist in Oahu to fill Sam Boyds stadium 

So years go by, and then I move to Las Vegas.  Still no Yoshinoya, but a few trips to LA, and I get my fix to settle my cravings for this cheap bowl of meats,rice, and vegtables that ruled of my early college years.

Finally,  Yoshinoya sets it marks in Las Vegas!   YES!     I always love eating here back when they first opened this location, but on my last trip.   Something is different about the chicken in the combo bowl.

The chicken isn't the same at all, and I liked it better when they broiled it with the skin on, and it had a crispy bite to it.   Thankfully, the beef is still the same, but the vegetables lacked the taste from what I'm accustomed too, and  now kind of hate it!   There was a nice chicken broth, buttery taste to the vegetables, and now it has no taste.  The plates has gotten bigger, but it's all about the memory of college days at this point, and I want my original taste back.    

McD's changed their menu, but they never screwed with the Big Mac...come on Yohinoya, bring back the original  taste.  It's not too late."}
{"text":"Absolutely Perfect!!! I lived in Japan for several years and this easily became one of my favorite restaurants. When I found out they had one here in Las Vegas I had to try it out. When I had my first bowl, I could swear I was back in Japan. I taste just like it does over there. So they don't make it the way most Americans would like it! Good! I like it better that way. Sure they have some different things one the menu here that they would never eat in Japan, but the important thing is that it is just as good as the GYUDON in good ole Japan."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego and wanted chicken & veggies.   Counter was very disorganized- at least 15 people waiting for food to come out. Finally got to order. Waited 10 min for my food. From where I was sitting could NOT hear them call my order. Food was fresh but cold. Not sure if anyone here knows or cares about customer service."}
{"text":"Yikes, my boyfriend and I decided to go here one day because it was a place we had never been too. It is also a place we will never go to again. One tip that the place was no good is the fact that we were the only people in the restaurant. This extremely peppy guy came in and started telling us what we could order and what was included, which I found very nice. We had some beef platter with veggies and a slice of strawberry and chocolate pie that was made somewhere else, because it was wrapped up like a delivered item. The beef was shaped like strings, not beef, so I'm not exactly sure what I  ate, but it wasn't the beef I know and love. The veggies were mediocre. The pie that wasn't made there was the best part.I'd go back for that, and only that."}
{"text":"MEMORIES!! 

OK so this place is just like an ASIAN style fast food joint! I FREAKEN LOVE yoshinoya! It brings back memories of all my childhood times & they only have this one location in Vegas! 

The staff are quick & just do their job. You order your food & then you pick up your food at the counter. 

LARGE BEEF BOWL $7.89 - This is only like 50 cents more than the regular size.. so OBVIOUSLY being the fatty I am I get the LARGE one... white rice topped w/ thinly marinated beef brisket slices & onions. If I want a quick simple simple meal this is what I crave. Plus I add some green onions & it just tastes that much better. 

CHEESECAKE $2.29 - I LOVE their cheesecake for some reason... it is so smooth in texture & just melts in your mouth. Ahahhaha 

This place may be strictly a childhood memory favorite but I hope they never change & never go out of business because if I become a mom & don't wanna cook & just grab a simple meal that I KNOW my child will eat... this will probably be my go to over McDonald's or any other fast food joint."}
{"text":"Why I'm giving a 4 star review to Yoshinoya is beyond me, the beef is well very fatty and the \"combo\" meal which they offer sucks, hard core.

However with Phoenix's culturally challenged environment, and strip mall infused environment, finding a beef bowl in the city has become well.... a problem. 

I drove 45 minutes for Yoshinoya because of my beef bowl craving and, although it's nothing like Kokoro in Denver or mom and pop places in LA they still serve up the same flavor with a little fatter beef and an exceptional taste for those who know what a \"beef bowl\" actually is.

Sad to say but the best beef bowl I've found in the valley, kudos to you Yoshinoya."}
{"text":"Been eating this stuff since I was a lil girl. Love it. This Vegas location has a good crew. Alfonsina is a sweetheart :)"}
{"text":"Panda Express kicks this place's bum, and I don't even really like Panda."}
{"text":"Okay. Gyudon is like one of my fave Japanese food. I have had Yoshinoya in Japan many times as well as in the ghettos of California. Haha. They had one in Vegas! Yay! Plus it was a rainy, wintery day so gyudon sounded amazing. We get to Yoshinoya and I am automatically thinking (or not thinking since I may have been too hungry) I will get a large beef gyudon. Of course the husband warned me but I did it anyway. I order the large. My husband also got a large but with vegetables and beef. It is so interesting how the menu at the restaurant has the amount of calories in each meal. Good and not good. I just happened to ignore those signs that day. Anyways, we got home and I thought I had accidentally bought a catering tray of meat and rice for a party but no, it was the large. Thank goodness for my teenage nephew who helped me finish. I absolutely love Yoshinoya. The taste is super consistent from Las Vegas to Japan (of course in Japan there are more ethnic peoples preparing the meals). I love the thin beef with lots of rice. It was so 'ono' as we say in Hawaii for delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Never let's me down. From CA residing in Vegas.. Grew up on this stuff. so having one out here is so great. Food is awesome, fast service!"}
{"text":"Small menu and all food tastes same. It hot in here with ac barely working. Been at UNLV four years and now I know why no one ever mentioned this place."}
{"text":"Came here today for a take out beef bowl.
For some reason, the entire store smelled weird today. 
The last time I ate here, everything tasted OK. Just like any Yoshinoya in Japan.
Today, their beef bowl was way too salty and the beef had a lot of fatty parts in it.
Maybe I came here the wrong time. 
I'll come back next time I have Yoshinoya withdrawals."}
{"text":"I have been to the Yoshinoya in CA many times. It is one of my buddy's favies! It is the first Yoshinoya I am trying in AZ. The food looks and tastes the same in the ones in CA. 

I have always love Toyko Express, so I had to compare the two. The beef bowl has thinly sliced beef with light terriyaki sauce, it was OK. I still like Toyko's beef bowl better due to the beef slices and sauce. Tried the chicken bowl too. The chicken has the skin on it, it is OK. I per fer Toyko's chicken without the skin. The sesame wings looks burnt, but they are not I think it is the sauce that make them look dark. It was OK too. 

If I am craving Japanese fast food and can not get to Toyko Express, I guess I will settle with Yoshinoya."}
{"text":"Man you can't beat Yoshinoya when it comes to finding a great value. You can get yourself a chicken bowl or a beef bowl for around $5 and have change left over for whatever else. 

I'm comparing this one to the one in L.A and I gotta say this location's chicken taste better because its crispier. I think because you have the grilled skin still on their. 

Pretty big location. 
Prices slightly higher than L.A"}
{"text":"If this location is any indication of how Nevada Yoshinoyas are, then may I suggest that training be done in California. Extremely slow and dirty, not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"this place is a state treasure, and i'm being serious.  the only yoshinoya in arizona.  i realize some of you cannot warm up to this place.  but if you're from cali and you've grown up on this stuff, or if you've spent some time in japan and have become familiar with the yoshinoya concept, then you'll come to love this place.  and realize just how valuable this location is.

the beef bowl is pretty similar to the way they do it in japan.  also love their chicken bowl.  love the saucy veggies on the side.  yum!!"}
{"text":"Who knew a place that can be so popular can be so disgusting.  I didn't know a beef bowl with vegetables could be made so bad.  The veggies were slimy because they were covered in some glop along with some thing disgusting beef that just smelled.  I've tried it in California also, and it tastes the same here.  I just don't get how it's so popular."}
{"text":"Someone told me they used to love this place in LA. I was driving by UNLV and thought I'd try it. Omg, it was horrible. The food was soggy and the meat was fatty and poor quality. I actually couldn't finish my food. I'm only giving them a 2 because the cashier was really friendly."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed yoshinoya since I was a kid. But this one just wasn't that good, I ordered the rice bowl and it tasted pretty plain. I don't know if it's just me or the restauranr but I overall didn't enjoy this yoshinoya that much compared to the other yoshinoyas I've eaten in."}
{"text":"Fast and easy check out, placed my order and paid pretty quick. I went around noon and it wasn't too busy. 

This place actually had pretty good food and is ready pretty quick so I really appreciate that when I'm on the go. Only thing that could improve is the rice to meat ratio. For the $7 I pay I get way too much rice but other than that it's pretty good!

Also ordered veggie spring rolls and they were super yummy and fresh!"}
{"text":"I really wish this place was here when I was in UNLV.  This would have been a great compliment to the Aloha Kitchen right across the street from it.  I had never had Yoshinoya before but someone at work told me they were big in Cali, it's kind of like Japanese home cooking.

I got around to finally visiting one night.  Wow, not bad at all!  I know, for the low prices you shouldn't expect 5 star gourmet cuisine but for what it was it wasn't bad at all.  It really got me wishin' this place was here when I was in college.  Imagine all the drunken nights, then getting a nice bowl to satisfy the munchies?  It would have been great I think.

This place isn't the cleanest of places (check the bathroom) but at least the dining room is clean right before a late night food rush.  You see where I'm getting?  This place is popular with the college folk!  In case you didn't know, Yoshinoya serves Japanese food bowls, almost like ramen but instead with rice and meat.  Their claim to fame is the 'Yoshinoya Beef Bowl'.  But they've added chicken since opening its doors back in California.

I LOVE the chicken and beef combo bowl (around $7).  It's got steamed rice on the bottom and is topped with their teriyaki chicken, fatty sliced beef (so yum! It's like the beef in sukiyaki), and a veggie mix (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, cabbage).  Their sauce makes it soooo good!  This hits the spot when you need a quick meal.  I almost forgot, you get a drink with the combo, and a side dish as well!  You can choose from a green salad, macaroni salad, soup, caramel flan, cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake or cookies.  So many choices!  I usually end up getting the green salad because on the desserts they actually include the nutritional info, leaving me feeling a little guilty.  If you eat in, on your table you have the choice of soy sauce, seasoning, and pickled ginger.  All you can eat pickled ginger!  I love the stuff and I eat a buttload of it with my meal every time.  It goes well with the sweet sauce of the dishes.  Prices for everything else are very reasonable and the food is filling.  I can get away with spending less than $20 for my gf and I, and we get entree, drink and side of salad or dessert.  

The customer service was friendly, even when they were busy with lots of college students.  Umm...half drunk college students...*tear* oh the memories!  They were completing orders quickly because it wasn't too hard to assemble one of their bowls or combos.  My only gripe here is that they serve Pepsi instead of COKE, ugh.  Boo.  I can't stand Pepsi.  I was born in Georgia....go Coke!  Coke is it!

And if you're a college student at UNLV, lucky you.  Yoshinoya has a special college meal, I think it's a beef bowl and a drink...all for $2.99!  But you gotta show your UNLV ID to get it.  No wonder the place was full of students that night.  Sure beats having to go to the DC (Dining Commons to you UNLV folk, Deadly Cuisine to my old college pal...ha ha) and figuring out what you're eating.  

Oh yeah, one last tip.  DO NOT save this stuff for leftovers the next day...it can be NASTY!  I think it could be the soggy rice.  It just doesn't taste right unless you eat it the same day you buy it.  Or maybe I added WAY too much ginger?  Anyway, just make sure you eat it all or throw away what you got left.  

But try this place if you're near UNLV and in a pinch for something to eat.  If you're not in the In-N-Out mood, give Yoshinoya a shot.  It's good, filling food.  Just don't blame me for a sore tummy if you eat your leftovers the next day!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience with my recent visit to yoshinoya. The rice bowl and veggies were greasy and unflavorful. The cooks might be using some cheap oil to cook their rice bowls with. Also, if you ask for some hot sauce or pepper your gonna get charged .70. The clam chowder that came with my rice bowl tasted better than the rice bowl and that is not saying much. The clam chowder was too watery and not one single clam in the cup. Also, the restaurant had a funky smell. Also, the floor was dirty and the restroom was very dirty. I hate to sound negative but the yoshinoya management needs to read this review. This restaurant needs some major changes fast if they wish to stay in business."}
{"text":"I gave their new grilled fish plate a try. It was a good-sized piece of fish, properly cooked. For the side I had vegetables, which are their regular vegetables simmered in chicken broth.

A decent amount of food, a good price, and much better than Long John's try at grilled fish."}
{"text":"One of my go to places for takeout for a quick dinner when I am not in the mood to cook!  The flavor is always good and consistent and the size of the big bowls are great I always have leftovers for my lunch the next day.

I love the large Beef Bowl with Veggies I also love to add the crushed peppers and a little bit of soy sauce.   My boyfriend likes the mixed bowl so he gets the Chicken, Beef and mixed veggies.  On a very hungry day we will add the Gyoza.  None of this is gourmet it is a fast food place but for a filling good flavored dinner it is perfect.

The staff is always friendly and fast with the service and the food. This will continue to be a great, fast take out dinner place for me!"}
{"text":"Unless, you've been in LA, you don't understand.  Yoshinoya is all about these fatty, beef strips that make your mouth punch you in the face.  It is the most savory, delicious, juicy beef you ever tasted, dare I say better than a ribeye or Philly cheesesteak?  Of course, the rib eye will fill you up, but this is like a delicacy, an amuse bouche.  It won't fill you up unless you have like four orders of it, but think of it as bacon.  You don't want to fill up on bacon.  Maybe I should get a Smashburger across the street and put three strips of the Yoshi beef on it.  Wow.  I'm doing that my next trip to Vegas.  So why only 3 stars?  Well, everything else is gross.  Sorry.  It's fast food for crying out loud.  I'm not taking a date here.  You also don't get a lot of the beef for your money.  The gyoza is frozen and nuked or something and has freezer burn.  Seriously, it's not a gourmet Japanese restaurant.  It's Japanese junk with the most amazing beef strips you ever had in your life.  Go there just for the beef, seriously, and put it on your burgers and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I have been to Yoshinoya in Japan. When I first went to Japan I refused to even try it, because it looked so nasty. But one drunken night, I gave it a try and found it to my liking. 

I just sampled the goods at the only location in Arizona. I must say that the location of this establish is sad. It is situated so far from the city that it is practically where the ghettoland means the farmland. 

I did see the Japanese lady that lingered around the restaurant. Most likely she is the one that owns it. What she needs to do is get to work and stop staring at all her patrons. If I were her I would start by firing all those lazy FAT mexicans who work there. They made me feel as if I had just entered a KFC!  However such measures might not be sufficient enough because the location is hurting the business. I myself had to drive 20 minutes to get there, another reviewer said it took him 45 minutes. Not to mention it is situated in an odd location in the plaza. I am of the opinion that they should move to Tempe. The place was odd. So empty.

As for the food, it was decent. However, not as good as the beef bowls I had experienced at Yoshinoyas in Japan. This is probably due to the Americanization of the menu items. I ordered the medium sized beef bowl, but wish I had gotten a large, because the best part of the bowl is the meat. I was surprised to find no chop sticks, seeing how that is how it is eaten in Japan. I also missed the tea.

Pertaining to the other reviewer's comments about the beef being thinly sliced and fatty -- that is the way they do it in Japan. It is way better that way than any fucking terrakyi beef bowl hands down."}
{"text":"So you looking for the Japanese version of McDonald's?

Well you found it here.  I was told this place was good, so we took a cab all the way out to here, the cab driver was a bit confused himself....

Anyways I picked up a combo platter.  It has both beef and chicken and came with a side and a drink.  The beef was really fatty, felt gross eating it.  The chicken however had a crunchy skin that reminded me of crispy pork and it was covered in a brown sauce that was very tasty.  They did make a decent japanese rice for a fasts food joint.  I was hungover so I decided to give their chicken noodle soup a try, it was super salty.  I also got the miso soup which you really can't mess up.  I tried my friend's cheesecake and it tasted like the ones from jack in the box which was right next door."}
{"text":"The smell of Pinesol is OVERWHELMING! EW! Decided to take my food to go! Beef bowl is AMAZING! The menu has expanded, too."}
{"text":"I got the teriyaki chicken bowl and it was alright. But if you're thinking about going here, you might as well be at Aloha Kitchen."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time, asked the lady at the counter what's the difference between the \"Beef\" and the \"Angus Beef\" and got the answer, \"they're 2 different beefs\". That's not what I meant, I meant is either one more tender or flavorful because it's about the same price. She still responded \"it's 2 different beefs\". Ok let me say I ordered the Angus Beef and was sort of disappointed with both the flavor and the chewy-ness from all the fat that was on every piece. Sauce is just drenching all over the meal (not a good sign that they don't really marinate their meats). The rice was not soft but more of an undercooked texture and taste. 2 stars was for the price being under $8 a plate, but this place is more a 1 1/2 stars compared to other non \"authentic\" Japanese places you'll find in a shopping mall."}
{"text":"Im shocked they have any good reviews! If I hadnt thrown out the DISGUSTING beef already Id have taken a pic to show how horrifying it looked. I almost threw up! All fatty and stringy.. thats not beef by any stretch of the imagination. And the teriyaki sauce is awful too. Idk how this place even exists. Then when I asked the woman if I could just get veggies instead to put in my rice she looked at me like I was insane. Sorry your food is nasty. And I didnt want to eat it. Never wasted $7 on anythhing worse than I did today. Now im heading to work still hungry and $7 none the richer... awful. Stay away."}
{"text":"I grew up eating the Yoshinoya beef bowl and still enjoy eating it. My friends and I stopped by Yoshinoya to grab dinner before driving back home to LA. Maybe it's because I haven't had rice in a couple days, but the beef bowl was ON POINT!

My order:
- beef bowl
- clam chowder
- asian wings

BEEF BOWL: first time here? Then get the beef bowl! I absolutely love their beef bowl. Make sure to put some seasoning on it and ask for a lot of ginger packs! The ginger complements the bowl VERY well. I think I end up eating at least 5 packs of ginger for my bowl.

CLAM CHOWDER: You're probably thinking.. clam chowder?! That's not even something Asian! I thought the same and honestly still wonder why they have clam chowder at Yoshinoya. BUT! It's so good. It's always nice to have some kind of soup when eating rice and the clam chowder is surprisingly very satisfying. (My friends like to pour some of the soup onto their bowl. I haven't tried it yet but they do mention how amazing it is.)

ASIAN WINGS: It's a bit sweet for my taste.. I personally don't like it but I don't think there's anything terribly wrong with it."}
{"text":"I finally did it, for Tony T.  I walked to Yoshinoya and got a beef bowl (gyudon) to go.  For whatever reason, the faded building/sign always turned me off, so I expected it to be old and dirty inside.  I already can get cheap gyudon from Japan Creek or just make it at home, so I never saw a reason to come here, though I worked within walking distance for almost 6 years.

I spotted Yoshinoya in Japan but never sought it out to eat at one.  The other day, I watched a show called \"Fast Foods Gone Global\" on Travel Channel, which usually chronicles US chains that infiltrate other countries and make special menus for each country's tastes.  However, this episode was international fast food companies' infiltration into the US, and whether or not menu items were changed for the American palate.

Yoshinoya has clearly adjusted its menu to the American palate, but the gyudon is still what gyudon is always - fatty thinly sliced beef cooked with onions in a sauce made with typical Japanese ingredients and served on top of rice, with beni shoga (red pickled ginger) as an accompaniment. I ordered a regular beef bowl (just under $6 with tax, and added beni shoga.  I also sprinkled on some shichimi togarashi and though not traditional, some chopped green onion that was out for miso soup orderers (only because green onions are my favorite vegetable!)

The menu otherwise has some odd things (I am not a fan of teriyaki type joints so I do not like the weird vegetables like zucchini in my bowls or stir fries), like vegetables, udon bowls, chicken and combo bowls, and grilled fish - I asked what type of fish and the lady pronounced something weird twice to me that started with an S, a name of a fish I certainly have never heard of in my life and have no idea how to spell...I did notice Yoshinoya now has ponzu sauce (not for the beef bowl but rather the fish).  I liked the to go bowl packaging and the meal stayed hot on my jaunt back to the office to eat.  I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the interior too.  Accepts credit cards for orders over $5."}
{"text":"always good to take a beef bowl home ....its aways good hot or cold not to mention the best hangover cure!"}
{"text":"Didn't enjoy it at all. I ordered the large beef bowl and requested to add green onions. I pushed all the beef out of the way and proceeded to only eat the rice. Even after adding soy sauce and red peppers, the meat remained tasteless."}
{"text":"I don't get it, mang. Why are you people busting on Yoshi? When they finally opened up a Yoshi here back in....idk...late 06???? I was taking some programming courses at LV...and I swear, it was so surreal....\"I could have sworn this thing wasn't here this morning when I went parked. Hmm.\" But then there it was. Routine would be to slam two Red Bulls, burn a cig, go to class, fuck around at Sam Ash for an hour, get lunch, and go back in. 

Having this on the corner definitely brought back many decadent memories of NoHo food runs at 2am (why do they call it NoHo? There Lotta Ho's, mang.) and buying (Quantity: One [1]) Combo Bowl every other week for the most interesting vagrant who had initiative. I guess y'all are more the Shibuya and Nobu types, huh? Taking that little \"Elite\" badge next to your name to heart, eh? 

It's aight. Bugger oof then, More inedible, disgusting slop for me! Woot!

Love, Randy"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite to eat!! Really convenient being close to UNLV"}

Understand Chicken has the weird color...yea. It's just how it is. It's EXTRA COLOR = EXTRA FLAVOR. I just dont like to drown everything in salt. ESPECIALLY VEGGIES. Ok the beef bowl. It's normally served like that. I guess I'm used to it.
No...It's not the best of Teriyaki bowls. But then again. This isn't a teriyaki place. This is Beef Bowl....They serve shaved beef. They serve Luminescent Chicken and Veggies...."}

{"text":"everytime i'd drive to azusa my roomie would tell me i HAD to stop by west covina to get a beef bowl from yoshinoya. i never did.. but i saw that this one had opened up! i got the #1 beef and chicken combo bowl with veggies and mac salad. i couldnt decide between the beef and chicken so this was perfect for me. i tried the beef first.. there wasnt much to taste. the chicken was a little better.. had a little more flavor but there was a lot of skin and not as much meat as i would have liked. both meats and the sauce were awfully bland. the mac salad was really tangy. i prefer L&L mac salad but they are two totally different recipes so thats not fair to compare i guess. i wont come back here to eat.. just not my cup o tea."}
{"text":"Like the food, but today was my first time at this location. Clean location and convenient for a quick lunch. However the food was  too salty. All customers were frustrated because no one understands what we are asking for. I'm pretty sure they were saying something about my butt in Spanish. People left with food but frustrated and the lady taking the food orders kept answering her cell phone that rang incessantly. I won't be back to this location. For lunch maybe a different shift."}
{"text":"This is the worst Japanese-American restaurant I have ever been to. Food is literally something my Japanese friends can make literally 10 times better. Food taste really bland and disgusting. Don't ever eat here because they over charge for meals here and the quality is terrible."}
{"text":"Yoshinoya, the beef bowl fast food chain from Japan.  It's beef bowl has a unique seasoning which no one can duplicate. Taste preference is up to each individual. 90% of the people I introduced Yoshinoya to have loved their beef bowl. The few who didn't like it is mainly due to the cut of their beef. The stringy and thinly sliced beef, that's most definitely frozen before being distributed to each chain restaurant.  The onions and flavoring added to the broth stock is the other half of the equation. I think its beef bowl is something you love it or hate it.  I'm happy Yoshinoya set up a shop in Vegas, despite Vegas' small city size. There's no Yoshinoya in larger cities such as Chicago or any other Midwestern cities for that matter.  It seems to be a coastal thing in the US. 
Beef bowl is what made Yoshinoya famous. So I won't comment nor do I order other items on the menu. Chicken is not too bad. I heard steak bowl is decent. But it's the beef bowl that stays true to Yoshinoya's name."}
{"text":"This corporate chain just didn't do it for me.  I'd rather just go to Tokyo Express or Samurai Sam's.  The beef bowl was thinly sliced, cheap, and fatty pieces of meat, and the teriyaki sauce tasted like it just came out of a  La Choy bottle.  The chicken was better, but nothing special. 

I only ordered a beef bowl and a chicken bowl, which I suspect are the most popular items, so I can't comment on the rest of the menu.  There may be a hidden gem in this place, but I don't think I'll be going back to search for it."}
{"text":"I don't see why they closed,unless colleges students are much ickier than i thought. First we have one,then we have none! WOW. You'd think that it would be booming.LOCATION IS EVERYTHING.Just sayin, they have so many in California, open one on Charleston and Town Center, you'd be surprised!"}

{"text":"After just returning from three months living in Japan I was missing my weekly Yoshinoya trips. Driving down Maryland Parkway the other day I almost caused a collision when I saw a Yoshinoya.

Now, obviously, compared to the Yoshinoyas I visited in Japan this is not the same thing. The busy, fast-paced lunch counter atmosphere in Japan is replaced by a bit of an empty, American fast food environment. This is disappointing (though expected) because sitting elbow-to-elbow with some stranger while you both slurp up shaved beef is half the fun of Yoshinoya. Anyhow, the only thing on the menu that looked vaguely similar to the Japanese version was the gyudon (beef bowl) which was exactly what I was after. Sadly this Yoshinoya doesnt offer any of the Japanese-style add-ons like raw egg, BUT there was a large tub of shredded ginger.

So after ordering a large beef bowl, with nothing else (no veggies, no sides, just the beef) I closed my eyes and indulged. I have to say... If I didnt hear the obnoxious UNLV kids next to me talking about Jay-Z I would have easily convinced myself I was back in Japan. The taste is very close and really good. This will definitely satisfy my gyudon cravings. I would just stick to the original, beef-only bowl and you are set. So excited to see this here!"}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for about 2 years so anytime I feel reminiscent of those drunken 4am nights I come here.  Not really so much like the ones in Japan though.  And I didn't think Yoshinoya was one of the better gyu-don places in Japan anyways.  

They should add Japanese curry to their menu.  I also wish they offered white meat chicken too.  I also agree with the weirdness of the veggie color.  I don't know why its gotta be so damn yellow.  Just go to Ichiza instead."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD. Being from Denver its not something we get to enjoy. Yoshinoya was a must go when i would visit California as a child and now on my trip to Vegas seeing one I needed to go. Had a Large Angus Beef and it was delicious. Price is very reasonable... under $10 including drink."}
{"text":"If you want to order rude with a side of laziness and sarcasm, be sure to order from: Vero, who doesn't seem to enjoy her job.

Poor customer service. Love the food though."}
{"text":"PROS: delicious white sticky rice, juicy beef, good teriyaki wings

CONS: unpleasant odor in restaurant, food was dry on this visit, new walnut shrimp have mayonnaise sauce not depicted in photos

I grew up going to Yoshinoya in Cali. It has a small menu, but there are some delicious options. I have been to this location near UNLV many times in the past, however this visit was a little below par.

I was excited to see the new Honey Walnut Shrimp bowl, but was dissapointed when it arrived covered in mayonnaise.  The vegetables were the standard vegetable medley that you get in a frozen bag from the store.  They usually have a broth that covers the rice but were dry on this visit.

The beef bowl is their signature item. The beef is thinly sliced and cooked in jus with onions. This is typically my favorite but was also dry on this visit.

Overall this trip was dissapointing. Too bad because this restaurant is usually delicious."}
{"text":"FAST FOOD.  Good alternative to BK, Mickey D's and Taco Bell.  Cheap place to get chicken and beef teriyaki bowls.  Decent for fast food."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today.read reviews and thought I'd try the beef bowl . Man was I disappointed, looked and tasted like they threw the beef into boiling water then threw it over rice.no flavor.won't be going back there again"}
{"text":"First of all..  I LOVE YOSHINOYA.  I've been going to YOSHINOYA since I was a kid in Los Angeles.  As an adult, I moved to Las Vegas and would make it a necessary stop to pick up YOSHINOYA for the trip back.  The usual was the Combo Bowl.  Beef and Teriyaki Chicken with veggies.  My husband would get the Teriyaki Chicken bowl with extra teriyaki sauce.  My girls would get the beef bowl with extra beef juice (I like to think of it as sauce).  The only differences from the past would be the fact that the chicken piece is no longer sliced in long strips.  You get chunks of chicken that has been tossed around.  Also, the containers have changed.  Instead of the large rectangular bowls, you get a short flat box plate.  The food stayed the same.  No issues there at all.  

My issues have to deal with the dirty seating area, oddly decorated space, and customer service that you have to scratch your head at.  Today's experience had to do with the fact that the cash register didn't want to work.  And then.. when asked about the special, they still rang it up wrong.  $5.69 large bowl + $1.80 for a large drink, when the special didn't say what size fountain drink you had to purchase.  Truth in advertising, please!!  This YOSHINOYA also doesn't seem to follow any standard rules.  Sometimes they charge you for extra sauces, sometimes they don't.  Sometimes you can get the advertised special, and sometimes you are told it's something else.  Frustrating, YES!  Will I go back?  ...  I won't make a trip that's out of the way. 

If you're in the mood for cheap japanese food, on the go.. stop in.  :\"D"}
{"text":"I only ordered the vegetables and the miso soup to go, so I still have a great deal to explore about this place. As far as location and interior goes, it is considered to be in a little bit of a \"rundown area\" but don't be so quick to judge a book by its cover. The interior is clean, modern, and my service experience was fairly friendly at best. The two side items I ordered was made in little less than 5 minutes, and was piping hot, so the quality of the food here is great. Good stop for college students in the area if they're looking for something different than Chipotle, In-N-Out, or Smashburger."}

{"text":"I grew up on this place and love this food. Straight up large beef bowl or large combo to go. Im there!"}
{"text":"Love the beef bowl they serve.  Been hooked since I was a kid and trying it at one of their many locations in SoCal.

This location looks like it is a bit worn down, but the food is still good.  I only wished they have a location on the West side of the I-15, so I don't have to drive 20-30 minutes to satisfied my gyudon fixing. But hey, it is better than driving 2-3 hours to California for one :)

Decor:  2/5  Looking old and tired.

Food:  4/5 for the beef bowl/gyudon, it is better than the microwaved?! gyudon that I was served at Shuseki.  Not a fan of their chicken bowl.  Skip the combo, I don't like their veggies. 

Price Value:  3/5  It is what it is.

Location:  Only on the East side of Vegas.  Great for UNLV students, not so good for me.

I still love Yoshinoya, so 4 stars."}
