{"text":"My gf and I were in Vegas for the weekend and found this nice little place. The food here is awesome and the service is great. We had the J's bento and the curry katsu loco loco. They were both really good."}
{"text":"I was craving pork hash and they make it big and very good. Don't need mustard and shoyu, it already has very good flavor.  I tried the bento and the mochiko chicken, chow fun, hot dog, and teriyaki beef were all very good, especially the mochiko chicken and chow fun.  The food reminds me of Hawaii. I will be coming back again since it is pretty close to where I live."}
{"text":"We found this little gem from Yelp. My little girl and I stopped by today. We were at the Children's Museum prior and the little one built up an appetite. Thought we'd give it a try and only 2 miles from the museum.  We asked for a half size order of stir fried noodles for my daughter and a bowl of soup. Great flavor from both dishes. My daughter enjoyed her meal especially the long John (custurd donut)."}
{"text":"So delicious...salmon white rice bowl and for desert long johns!!! Have not tried other dishes but I will."}
{"text":"I don't know what people see in this place, first of all as soon a you walk in it reeks of roach smell then you wait forever to get your food things that should be so simple and fast to cook takes them over 25 minutes to get it to you. Then the Boss lady walks in and tells everyone,  oh sorry everyone someone called in today that's why it's taking a little long... that was the same excuse she used before at there 1st restaurant... and all I ordered was 2 long John's and 2 pork hash..@$2.85 a long john they can keep it. The long John that I order from Vons tastes better then that, the custard in their long john was like straight from the can then tried our friends Katsu curry and that didn't even have taste it was so plain and even their mac salad. Would not go there again and will not recommend it to anyone.  And the food is pricey like it should taste like zippys or something. Also had other people on the other table telling each other of how bland their food taste"}
{"text":"Went in with a friend for a taste of home. I had J's bento, and it was delicious! The mochiko chicken was perfect, the teri beef was spot on, the pork hash was better than Honolulu's Chinatown. With Hawaiian music playing over the speakers, it was definitely a taste of home for us. Best Hawaiian food I've had in Vegas. Next time I go, I'm gonna have the poke bowl!  Mahalo nui loa!"}
{"text":"Great place for local kine grinds!!! Pork hash, Manapua, long johns, beef sticks, bentos!!!! Bruh you really need to get the pork hash, it's that dam amazing!!!! Always order 15 for $11.99 Togo!!!!"}
{"text":"Bomb food. Awesome customer service. Fast service. I will definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I didn't like my poke, but everything else was good. It was my first time here. I ordered a scoop of Mac salad, one spam masubi, one bbq chicken skewer, and the poke bowl. I could have ate an entire bowl of the Mac salad, it was delicious! The spam masubi didn't disappoint either. The skewer was cooked perfectly. Not dry and full of flavor.   Now, I don't remember what poke I got, it was one with onions, and they were REALLY STRONG. I took them out and the rest of the bowl was ok, but I mean they aren't really known for their poke, so it wasn't  a huge deal to me. I'll definitely be coming back to try the pork hash and the long johns, they looked so good!"}
{"text":"This place a 10 start not a 5. First of this place bomb af and portions are big and worth your every penny. 2ed.... Idk this place is just good and worth it."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and food is good. The only thing is that myself and 8-10 other patrons had to wait 45-50 minutes for food. Unfortunately they made me late. They didn't look to prepared for the lunch rush. I might try them again if I don't see anyone ahead in line."}
{"text":"I don't know about this place.... I mean, we went just specifically to taste the food. So we ordered the J's bento, Pacific bento and side pork hash as well as a long john. I can always tell when my husband doesn't like his food, he'll get quiet and he won't eat it all. He's the type to never waste food, but he didn't like the battered fish and kalbi and he tried the pork hash and said it was hard. He ate some katsu and left the rest. As for my bento... I hate when people make LOTS of food that doesn't taste that good. I don't care how much food you give me, if it doesn't taste good, I'm not coming back and I'll let my friends know it's not good. I was waiting at least for a little crunch to the mochiko chicken and it was just fried and plain and just sweet, unlike the kind I've had all my life in Hawaii. I was wondering about their batter or lack of. The pork hash that we heard was so famous, was a disappointment... like big for nothing. This is why I say big food isn't always the greatest food. Like my hubby said, it was hard and was a big blob of pork and some simple flavoring, I almost felt like they skimped out on ingredients and opted instead to make it bigger than the normal pork hash, but really  the size just diverts from the lack of visual appeal and taste. The chow fun was meh at best, although I did like that it actually had vegetables in there. I tried the teriyaki meat and it was hard, I didn't care for the flavor. So the only thing I ate was some noodles and a couple pieces of mochiko chicken and a bite of hot dog and rice, really you can't screw that one up. Finally the long john... again I think the theme here is \"go big or go home\" it's a good size, but my husband didn't like it, he thought it was doughy. We didn't want to be rude because the owner's wife was right there talking to other people, so we wrapped up our food and took it home only to be thrown away the next day. Goes to show, looks and size isn't everything especially for food. I'd much rather have less food but delicious. Taste is the reason I would go back for more, but I don't think we'll attempt this place again."}
{"text":"Unko, Aunty and family operated business. True local food made from the heart. Hands down you can taste the Aloha in all their food. Gotta try the best rice cakes in town on the weekend, and you can't beat 15 pork hash for only $11.88! Mochiko chicken is Bomb. Make the drive but call first to reserve the goods! So worth it"}
{"text":"The food is authentic \"Local\" Hawaiian comfort food. Very nice people. We will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food. The staff is really friendly. Got J's Bento Box, came with rice, chow fun, chicken, teri beef, and pork hash. Enough to share with another person. And the rice cake for dessert is good too."}
{"text":"Drove all the way here because they had long johns!!!  They open up at 11am but we had to wait a few minutes after 11am before they actually opened the doors.  The place got pretty busy soon as the doors open.  It's a small place with a few tables and chairs.    Their it was in the display!  Long johns!  We got 2 of those.  They were big!  And delicious!  We got the bento with the chow fun, redondo hotdog (omg my mouth jus watered), Teri beef, Michu I chicken, and rice.  Everything was cooked to perfection just like home!  We also got the Managua and pork hash.  The pork hash was huge and delicious.  The Managua was ono. They only have can drinks and have no fountain drink.    I will be back to try that Hawaiian plate!"}
{"text":"So first visit, The people here are very nice. I ordered Chili bowl. So just be aware that the chili sold here is reheated ZIPPY'S Chili.  I asked it was confirmed. They cant advertise it as such because of legal issues but they can re sell.  I bought 12 long johns to take to a dinner tonight as my contribution. 2.85 a piece. Worth every penny. People next to me got Spicy tuna nachos on won ton chips, they look Bomb.  This place is clean and again folks are nice.  what can they do better: tell folks its Zippy's chili add more mayo to your mac salad its so dry and that's not local style.   Ill be back with others to try more items, because you gottah support local businesses."}
{"text":"We love finding these gems around the valley. The location is not in the most ideal part of the valley, but worth the drive. Family-run business and they have so much aloha. The food reminds us of the grinds we had back home in Hawaii.  So ono and filling. We will definitely be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"First time, had J's Bento Box , side of Mac, and their famous Long Johns ! Every thing was fabulous, and had a cozy island vibe. We will be coming back !"}
{"text":"Pretty good island style poke! I will be back for more! Pork hash didn't taste too much like pork hash but pieces were large. We also had a poke bowl which was huge and topped with avocado. Staff were super friendly service was a bit of a wait and not much seating. All in all I'll be back for more for sure happy to see Hawaiian Style food on Charleston !"}
{"text":"Good Local \"Hawaiian\" style grinds,   Special are da bomb!!, Bento box entrée is great stuff!! Dessert Long John da best!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here!!!! Everything is delicious especially their pork hash!!!  Ahi limu is also a must!!! Rice cake is also delicious (one of my favorite)  Everyone is also friendly and welcoming! I will be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Not very many restaurants serve real, authentic Hawaiian Style food. But... this place is the real deal! The porkhash is on point, Kalua Pig w/ Cabbage was bomb, & the Spicy Ahi Nachos is amazing. Also the staff is super friendly and helpful. Most definitely will be returning and I 100% recommend this place to anybody on a lookout for bomb local style grindz! lol"}
{"text":"The food is great here, but I'll give this place that much. I probably won't come back considering the wait time. We got here at 1245pm and we didn't get our food until 130pm."}
{"text":"The place is flat out amazing. Great hawaiian style plate lunch. So good. I wish it was closer to northwest only problem I would gain weight!  Keep going!"}
{"text":"This is the first that we visited this place after seeing pictures on FB from our friends page, we had to come and experience their food. The place is small, like a hole in wall place. Very clean and maintain. The staff was great and the food was excellent, they do make their food fresh so expect some wait time and also they do give large portions, we just love their pork hash it's huge, we also had their 3 layered cake it was delicious, we will be back! Mahalo for bringing some island taste away from home."}
{"text":"I noticed this place a few months ago and made it a point to one day check it out, today was that day.  I walked in and immediately could hear Hawaiian music playing over head, already giving me the feeling of nostalgia of being back home in Hawaii at a local Mom & pop restaurant which is very much like being back in the islands.  The restaurant is small with a few tables, aloha shoyu can be seen on all the tables, another detail to make a Hawaiian like me feel at home.  I perused the menu & ordered the large fried plate, 15 pieces of pork hash, & J's bento.  The cashier will make you feel like family & the wait for the food wasn't very long though they did have quite a few patrons.  I have to say the food is very good.  J's bento includes chow fun (very local to Chinese food in Hawaii), Redondo's hot dog, mochiko chicken, and teri beef, all sitting on a huge portion of rice.  The fried rice has all my favorite things, char sui, egg, spam, etc...if your one person, perhaps you should consider the smaller portion as the large is perfect for two people.  15 pieces of pork hash. Traditionally, pork hash (a type of potsticker) are usually in small bit s size pieces- but these are huge in portions. If your ever having a Hawaiian potluck, this would be my recommendation!  I'm excited to try other dishes on the menu.  It's not a big menu with tons of selections, I like that they are keeping it simple without so much confusion.  Poke, cone sushi, long johns, Kalbi, teri beef, & island style chicken is also available.  If your in the area & craving some Hawaiian fare, I would recommend this place!  I will be ordering from them again in the near future. Perhaps you may also!  :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! The Loco Moco is sooooo good. Thinking about it right now but the downside is they don't open until 11:00. The pork hash and Long John's are delicious as well. Still need to try the Poke but always craving the Loco Moco so haven't had a chance yet. Friendly service too. Always greeted with a smile."}
{"text":"Long Johns.  Enough said.  . I've been here a couple times.  The first time coming in, I couldn't believe the size of the Long Johns and how much filling is inside.  By no means am I complaining about that because I love custard.  It's my favorite!    This place is definitely filled with Aloha Spirit.  Great Aloha service each time I've gone in.  A few things I've tried here is their J's Bento Box:  Rice, Fried Mochiko Chicken, Teriyaki Beef, Chow Fun Noodle, 100% Beef Hotdog & 1 Pork Hash.  Excellent to my liking's.    The Chow Fun on my next visit was nice and still piping hot when I got home.  The order was plenty for a small order which I like.  The flavor of the chow fun each time I got it was different but still good.  The pork hash here is always good.  Brings me back to when I was younger and the manapua truck that came around after school with pork hash.  Glad this place is near my work.  Not a far place to get my island fix during the week.    Definitely will come back to try the rest of the menu. So with that being said, Happy Eatings!"}
{"text":"Over the weekend, we had family visiting which means we ate a lot of food, specifically Hawaiian-style food.  Once they left, all I really wanted was a salad, until I saw Pacific Island Taste's business page come up on my Facebook feed.  So off to Charleston and Maryland Pkwy on Sunday, patiently sitting through traffic on the 15-N while I drove to keep my husband from complaining.  I pulled into the small parking lot for the little strip mall that Pacific Island Taste is located. It was strange for me because I felt like I pulled into the parking lot of a similar strip mall back in Kalihi!!!  To say the least, I was feeling nostalgic.  We walked in and up to the counter to order. I was ready because I've been craving pork hash (pork shumai), manapua (steamed pork bun) and chow fun.  While waiting for the counter help to take our order, my husband and I couldn't help but oooh and aaaah over the large sized pork hash that walked by us along with J's bento plate.  So although I thought my husband was going to get the bento, he ended up getting a chili frank plate.  And of course, we can't forget the ahi limu poke.  Per the counter help, limu is flown in from HI!!  My bill came out to $58. Don't be upset and think they are over priced.  On the contrary, I believe they are reasonably priced. My husband posted on FB about Pacific Island Taste. Today, my husband's friend commented that he went today and spent over $60. These Hawaiian's are homesick for food that takes them back to a simpler place and time.  Therefore, we are willing to splurge and enjoy the leftovers.  15-piece pork hash is priced at $11.88.  One size of their pork hash is 3 pork hash from Royal Kitchen in downtown Honolulu, or so it seems. But it's big.  I ordered a plate of chow fun at $12.99.  Again, the portions are large so not only did I have a fourth of it for lunch, my husband and I had 2/3 of it for dinner and I had the rest for my breakfast.  The manapua, because it is steamed and not baked had more mana than pua'a. And I believe this is what filled me up during lunch that I wasn't able to eat as much chow fun as I would have liked. Hopefully, they'll introduce baked manapua to their menu.  I was able to taste my husband's chili plate. Although it isn't zippy's chili, it sure is close to it. It was so good, my husband had chili mustache :D  And the poke with limu...so so so ONO!  The restaurant does have a small baked goods section.  But even at 12 pm on Sunday, all that was left was an empty tray of powdered sugar outline of a large eclair :(  We were told that only six dozen are made per day.  If you want some, you have to call ahead of time to reserve.   Service was great. Super nice people.  For me, it is apparent that these are humble beginnings for them and they are willing to work very hard for you and I.   The restaurant is clean.  The restaurant is on the smaller side with four tables allowing seating of 16 people only. However, with the amount of people coming in, ordering and having to take out because of the lack of seating, I hope they are so successful that they can move to a centralized location that is larger and can accommodate their fans.  Mahalo Pacific Island Taste for bringing us a little bit of home to this 9th Island."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I called and made an order to go. I ordered the Kalua Pork with cabbage, and Kalbi and when I came to pick up my order I saw they had Oxtail soup from the special of the night. The first two order comes with white rice and macaroni and cheese.  The Kalbi was cooked to perfection and the sauce that was marinated with was absolutely delicious. My bf loved the Kalua Pork. The portions were big and we had lots of leftover.  The restaurant is located on E. Charleston and Maryland Pwky. It is small joint and has few tables. The staff that work there were nice and friendly! They greeted me as soon as I walk in.  This is a hole in the wall hidden gem, that sadly is far from where I live. They had a variety of breakfast items as well. So many items to try next time!  Something to remember they close early... at 7pm.  Overall all, we love the food and the price was resonable.  I would definitely return to this location for a quick bite when I am in the area."}
{"text":"A small but flavorful little place. Wow. We live in the area and saw that the old pizza joint turned into a hawaiian spot! After passing by a few times we checked it out. Food was very tasty. My Pit BBQ plate was coated perfectly with bbq sauce. I was worried it would be gunky..but it was not!  And to top tlit off we got to sample a Long John! Oh my god it was so delicious. I jear they are made fresh every morning! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This probably the most amazing place for authentic hawaiian plate lunches. Great food and portion size. There other places like this but nothing comes close to them and the service they bring. They are friendly and welcoming every time i go to get some food. Hands down the greatest and it's close to my home."}
{"text":"Had the Pacific Bento.  The chicken was dry and tasteless along with the fish.  The meat?  Was tough and could not cut it with the plastic knife.  Dumped more than half my plate.  Restaurant located in a bad area.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Food is ono! As soon as you walk in you're transported back home to a mom n pops, hole in the wall Hawaiian food restaurant, like People's Cafe or Helena's. Same vibe... few tables, just enough chairs, fan blowing cuz it's a little hot, I love it!  The owners are full of aloha, love talking story with them. I ordered a bento... usually bento's are small portions for on the go type hunger, but these the are humongous! Like a Thanksgiving dinner for one!  Pork hash are huge, long johns are the bomb, I have yet to try everything on the menu. I just ordered some squid luau for pick up on Saturday because when they make it, it sells out quick. I live clear across town, but I'll drive here anytime"}
{"text":"Delicious food, generous servings, and friendly workers make for an AWESOME establishment!!!"}
{"text":"Soooo Good & Soooo Yummy, brings us a little closer to home. It looks like a family based business they have rice cake as well. Support Local businesses!!!!"}
{"text":"I am always excited for new restaurants to open with a taste of Aloha. I reviewed the yelpers choice and I took the recommendation of the workers here. I ordered the J's Bento, spicy mayo tuna poke, side of mac salad, and 2 Long Johns custard filled donut. The bento plate looked great, but the rice was mushy. I was told there was a new guy working so I hope it improves because it did not complement my meats at all. The mochiko chicken was okay. The teri beef was very good. The hotdog was not Redondo's. The chow fun was filling. The mac salad was bland and it did not complete my bento. The pork hash was good.The spicy mayo tuna poke was okay. Here's the highlight: The Long John is excellent. The service was very nice and the place is clean. I would come back here to try other menu items and I would go out of my way to get more Long John custard filled donuts."}
{"text":"Hands down the best local hawaiian food in the state! Definitely brings me back to my roots.. from the second i walk in to the last bite of my order. If you know local hawaiian food.... this place is straight up thee definition of ono kine grinds!!! Service and quality, the best!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the huge pork hash, the rice cake and the long johns. The pork hash is huge but delicious. The rice cake is nothing short of a Manapua man favorite and the long johns are just like I remember as a kid. I look forward to trying more items on the menu and I hope this place is around for a while. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is so good the food , very tasty and good portions I went there yesterday evening get some dinner to bad it's way otherside of town or I would go more often , I had very bad experience with this other local place on Sahara and Decatur  i ordered oxtail soup from its only place that has it daily and my little guy loves it his very particular at times what he wants to eat , so I called them a girl answered she placed me on hold for 10 minutes comes back on and says oh wait she puts me on hold again then a young guy answered and I placed my order , if not for that oxtail freak that place portions are small actually ridiculous amount no wats in comparison , to you guys ! You guys are the best hoping you guys have a place soon on southwest side ."}
{"text":"Wow, our first time to go to PIT. Violet was so friendly and helped us decide on what to order. The pork belly musubi was amazing. The mahi was cooked perfectly. Pork hash is a winner. She gave us a sample to try. The long johns were to die for. The only negative is that the fried rice was a little to greasy, but the favor was good. Although it is a small place, it is filled with lots of Aloha. We will be back to try butterfish and pork belly bowl. Thx Violet."}
{"text":"This is the only place you can find \"real\" local food.  Try out their \"ono\" pork hash and long johns.  Thank you Joe and Violet for the Ono local style food.  Much aloha to you and your ohana."}
{"text":"Awsome Hawaiian food. You must try their manapua and pork hash.  The serving sizes are massive so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Small, but spacious family owned spot with 4 tables inside.   Portions are good for what you pay for.   Ordered the Katsu Curry Loco Moco under breakfast & the fried mochiko chicken.   Katsu Loco Moco comes with chicken catsu drenched in curry gravy over 2 scoops of rice & 2 eggs. Not a fan of curry, but you can smell the spices within the dish. My boyfriend said he'd rather have Japanese curry (irrelevant lmao).   The mochiko chicken comes over cabbage along with rice & a side of Mac salad. It was pretty good & crispy, BUT. I feel like it was missing something. My suggestion would be to include a side of teriyaki sauce or other sauce to go with the plate. The chicken was somewhat plain (not bad though). I decided to dip it into sriracha, which made it better.  They have a water dispenser for self serving.   Service is great. Since Vegas is a tourist spot, they ask you where you're from, why you're visiting, etc. They offer suggestions on the menu & tell you what's most popular. I would come again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"My usual Hawaiian spot Downtown is Aloha Specialties, but I decided to try this new place out because I didn't feel like dealing with parking and walking through the California Hotel. Upon arriving, I realized this is a restaurant that fits the stereotype of being located at Charleston and Maryland. Don't come to Pacific Island Taste looking for a fancy dining experience.   I ordered the J's Bento Box because I wanted to try the fried Mochiko chicken. It comes with fried Mochiko chicken, teriyaki beef, chow fun, Redondo hot dog, pork hash, and rice. It's a ton of food, but I was disappointed. The chow fun was extremely greasy and the teriyaki beef was overly sweet. On the plus side, the Mochiko chicken was delicious.  I'll probably give it one more shot, but for now, three stars."}
{"text":"First time here on a Saturday evening. The place is in a tiny strip mall. A few tips, there's no fountain drinks also no outside food or drinks. Staff was super friendly, they have breakfast, lunch and dinner. They have a small selection of pastries including long johns which are my fave. If you don't know what those are, they're basically powdered donuts that are filled with custard or vanilla pudding that are long in shape.  We got the J's bento box, pork hash, side of fries, ahi limu poke and chow fun. I think the chow fun noodles were a little too soft, basically over cooked. The pork hash pi was a little over cooked too. So why 5 stars? Well, when comparing this place to other Hawaiian food places in Vegas, the taste of the food comes pretty close to the real stuff. I appreciate the prices too, the pork hash were pretty big!  I'd definitely visit this little hole in the wall again. It was clean, and the restroom was decent too."}
{"text":"Ordered last minute lunch Pork hash and chow fun I must say that they were able to make my order on a last minute notice. Driving all the way from the north side to this family owned business is worth it!! Will recommend this place to family and friends! If you want local grinds this is the place to go! Thanks Pacific Island Taste"}
{"text":"Bento awesome and really good. Tried the poki and long john -ONO!!! Check it out , we will love it."}
{"text":"I've been searching for this place for a while and FINALLY found them! Mainly because they are the only restaurant that has Poke Nachos using wonton chips  used to be Joe's Island Grindz off W Charleston but they moved & rebranded... they are hidden in a plaza but totally worth the drive.   Food is so flavorful and customer service is great.   What else would you need??!"}
{"text":"Really delicious and authentic Hawaiian plates and friendly staff. We went back the day after our first time visiting for more !"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up .   We came in for lunch and dined in. It's clean and comfortable in a small, family-owned kind of way, which is exactly what it is. I'm big on supporting small, local businesses and food is no exception.   I came here per recommendation of a friend. Service was friendly and prompt. We ordered a Keiki Bento and an Ahi limu poke bowl. I got the J's bento to go for JD.  The Keiki bento comes with a spam musubi, fries and mochiko chicken. It was hot and freshly fried! I had to snag a couple bites before T hoarded it all to himself. The fries and chicken were fried to perfection. My one complaint is that the pieces of chicken were pretty small and I thought the portion size could have been a little bigger. But frankly, it's a great deal coming in at $5.99.   My poke bowl... WHEW! I can't believe I'd find a place to give Poke Express a run for their money, but dang. The ahi came in huge chunks on a bed of furikake rice. Nothing was over seasoned or salty. It's on special right now, but I'm REALLY hoping they keep it! I eat pretty clean most of the time and would come back on the regular just for that. I HIGHLY recommend you try it!   The J's bento was for JD and I didn't see it myself because we dropped it off to him at work. Reportedly, he thought it was great but too much rice and not as much meat as he thought there was by the weight of the box. He seemed a bit disappointed in that respect, which I think is understandable.   Collectively, we all agreed that we'd be revisiting this hidden gem. Authentic Hawaiian is hard to come by in this city that's filled with L&L's and other places of the like. I'm grateful to have been turned on to this spot!   Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Great quality authentic Hawaiian food. Extensive menu provides a lot of options. Staff is very friendly. Awesome addition for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of that hole in the wall place my father use to take me to have lunch. I had J bento and it was nostalgic. It reminded me of back in the day when i would go on a field trip and stop at the local drive in and order a bento for lunch.  J bento had teriyaki, hot dog, michiko chicken, pork hash, rice and CHOW FUN!  My favorite!  Everything about it was ono!  I also had limo poke which hit the spot.  I ordered manapua, pork hash and long john to take home to my kids.   Everything was ono. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Small, hole in the wall restaurant that's serving up some good eats. We ordered the teriyaki beef plate, shoyu-onion poke bowl, pork hash, bbq pork manapua, and a Long John.   The teriyaki beef was insanely good! The teri sauce wasn't the typical thick sauce you get at most places. It seemed more shoyu based but still had the sweetness of a teri sauce. The pieces of beef were incredibly tender and they used real steak, I think it was rib eye? So good. My BF got the poke bowl and he said it was pretty good. The pork hash was seasoned really well and were huge. The manapua was ok. It was a little dry, maybe from being frozen (not sure if they freeze them but I've had frozen siopao/manapua before and it had the same texture) and the filling was a little bland. Finally, the Long John! It's like a donut bar filled with custard and topped with tons of powdered sugar. You'd think it'd be overly sweet but it wasn't. The custard was thick and rich, the donut part was light and fluffy, and the powdered sugar added just the right amount of sweetness. I'd go back just for these bad boys.   Staff was friendly and service was quick. They have tons of options I'd be interested in trying so I'm sure I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Went in over the weekend and forgot to post. I'm new to Las Vegas and fell in love with the Hawaiian cultured food here... let's just say I'm addicted. First off let's start by saying, Usually at hole in the wall places I always give the benefit of the doubt ...but this one just....rubbed me the wrong way. Location was in the hood where the homeless camps out but that never stops me eating at a good place cause I'm from Miami and nothing stops us. I went along with everyone else's awesome  reviews about this place but this place you have a wait time.... wait time plus considering when you wait, you can't wait to eat, and when you're hungry everything tastes good!....not this place I probably threw out more than half my plate. Very Disappointing to have been left hungry plus the wait to eat....Burger king across the street would have been more satisfying. Hope Pacific Island Taste gets it together and create better customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Today I go in to try the Poke and Spicy Ahi Nachos but when I arrived, I found they have OXTAIL Soup!!  Oh man Lucky day!  This was some of the best Oxtail soup I have had!  The nachos and poke are always awesome but I had to let everyone know about the oxtail!  By the way the family that runs this place is awesome!!  Go say Hi!"}
{"text":"I will be the first to admit that when I went there, there was a long wait. But you didn't feel like no one cared or you were forgotten about. I planned all month to try the food here and I live in Phoenix and was also getting food to take home. I Ubered from my hotel. I like a little more noodle on my pork hash, but it was still good. The fried rice, katsu loco moco and chow fun were spot on enough to have me coming back. Wish I could come when the haupia rice cake and Hawaiian special are served because the long john brought me back to my childhood. Keep up the ono food!"}
{"text":"Violet & Joe at Pacific Island Taste catered a birthday party for us and it was amazing! The food tastes just like home. Fried rice, mochiko chicken, bbq beef stick, chicken katsu, chow fun, mac salad, poké, manapua all onolicious!  Violet bakes the creme-filled long johns herself so don't forget to get some of those too. Wash it down with some Hawaiian Sun. Broke da mouth!  BTW, the guy that wrote the other review about how he didn't like the mushy rice: He obviously isn't from Hawaii cause we like our sticky rice."}
{"text":"I've been not so secretly stalking this place...I fell in love with their food when they were Touch of Aloha up North and then when they migrated to the food court location, and finally they have put down new roots. Love the different variety they serve up here compared to the normal Hawaiian spots (mochiko chicken, pork hash, butterfish, manapua, poke nachos, rice cake, long johns, etc.)  The location is a little sketchy but the food/price are worth the drive. I LOVE PORK HASH...and this is one of the few Hawaiian spots that sell it in town.  These pork has are humongous ....$.99 each or $11.99 for 15.  I always opt for the 15 and freeze some for later =).  These remind of the ones they sell at 7 eleven in Oahu.  The other stand out item is mochiko chicken,  the coating is the perfect sweet, savory, crunchy.  They also have chow fun here...but I'm Chinese and can't really do the Hawaiian version since I'm use to the Cantonese version.  Probably one of my favorite Hawaiian spots in town. Call in orders ahead of time to save time."}
{"text":"My family and friends have been supporters of the business as long as I can remember. I was extremely excited when the owners decided to open a location near Maryland Prkwy and Charleston since it was a bit of a distance before. My mother and I decided to visit the location the other day since coming across an uploaded post of their chicken katsu curry while scrolling on FB. The location is very accessible, however during extremely busy business hours, parking can be a bit of a challenge along with the fact that there is also other businesses nearby. That day however, we arrived during almost late afternoon and there was a lot of parking. Amidst entering the restaurant, the atmosphere is very simple and we were warmly greeted by Violet. TBH, while going through their menu, it was a fairly difficult decision to decide on what to order, but as stated earlier, we choose to get the chicken katsu curry and a side order of a 1/2LBS of poke to go.   Pros: The food was absolutely delicious; the chicken katsu curry was crisp and seasoned well with no bites of undercooked chicken or batter, while the sauce was perfect. The poke on the other hand was fresh made to order and didn't have any fishy aroma.   Cons: The wait time for our food was a bit tiresome, but knowing chicken takes longer to cook was understandable. In my opinion, I think they focus more on phone and take out orders rather then their dine in customers. The only reason why I state that fact is for those people who happen to stop by and don't have the time to wait. I was a little disappointed in the portion size and the lack of curry sauce along with hoping I could of gotten a side of Mac salad.   Even with several cons, it's definitely a place to satisfy your island grinds and I would highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"I took my mother here for lunch while we were on vacation in Vegas.  The place was small but there was seating. I ordered the mochi chicken and my mom got the Pacific bento. The portions were big...but the flavors were bigger! We also got some spam musubi and char sui manapu. They were delicious! Eating this reminded me of when we lived in Hawaii...bringing back great memories!  This place got crowded in no time..people know where the good food is!  I will definitely be back on my next visit to Vegas. I highly recommend this place. The prices were very reasonable and so worth every cent!"}
