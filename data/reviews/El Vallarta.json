{"text":"Walked in and we were immediately seated. It took the waitress a few minutes to take our order and they bring out drinks.   They bring the chips and salsa and our cups are empty for at least 5 minutes before the waitress asks if we need a refill.. I mean DUH!!!  Drinks are empty again when the entree arrives. And waitress again asks if we need another refill.  The food was really good and there was plenty on our plates.   Food was the only thing going for this place! Maybe we had a dud??"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend so we were optimistic but the food and drinks were a huge disappointment. We tried the cheese and seafood dips but both were so thin it was impossible to scoop and resulted in a complete mess with most of it on the table. The fish tacos were tasteless, the refried beans watery, and the fajitas salad had no salad just fajitas filling on a plate. But worst of all were the frozen margaritas. The frozen margaritas seemed to be premade then kept in the freezer so you are served a solid block of ice which made them undrinkable! We thought they would thaw but they didn't and we had to wait until the meal was finished to drink them. This was totally unacceptable and the margaritas were not good. We definitely won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"Not a good place. Beer and cheese dip only! Sprite or a coke is good.  Service is ok. Food horrible. Mexi food with zero flavor. Eww"}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping, we were hungry and this place did the job.  I was a little worried because the place was almost empty, but I have to say the service was wonderful.  The waiter was extremely nice and made sure we were taken care of.  The cheese dip lacked flavor and was watery but not terrible (I woudn't order it again) However the chimichanga and the shrimp quesadilla was wonderful!  More people came in to dine, but our waiter was still attentive, and made sure we were good.  I think the prices are fair for the portions and quality of the food.  I'll definitely be going back; and I think next time I'll try the margarita!"}
{"text":"Cheap, quick Mexican food. Lunch specials under $5. Generally tasty though it won't change your life. Buy fresh salsa to take home... that's the real speciality1"}
{"text":"I was on this place today for dinner and the server was very rude, I   request two margaritas with little ice, and she replied back there was no possible because it was the restaurant law,  to put the same amount of ice, after that she say that she say hurry up to make the order because she have to many tables, very very nasty attitude To  the customer,  I am not recommend a place to anybody, I went to the restaurant next-door and the service was great,"}
{"text":"I have been living in NC for 8 years and this is the best Mexican food I've had since moving here.  Food was great.  Had a shrimp dish and everything was cooked to perfection.  My wife had a Burrito and that was really good also. This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This is what passes for Mexican food in Waxhaw. It's OK if you need to pick up something in a hurry - the food is somewhat sloppily presented, but edible.  However, beware if you order take-out.  Check your order carefully before you leave.  The kitchen staff does not care if it packs you someone else's order, or leaves part of your order out.  I have ordered take-out many times and learned the hard way."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service!  Took over two hours start to finish.  The food was mediocre and not even hot when it came out.  Salsa tastes like it came from a jar at the grocery store.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We've been here several times before, and it's always been okay-maybe a little less. We went today, and it was really good. The entire restaurant was cleaner, and the food was very tasty, much better than before.  I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This is our first time to eat at this location. We have eaten at the Waxhaw location three separate occasions.  The food has been consistently good.  We thought we would have to give up good Mexican food when we left Texas.  We have been pleasantly surprised.  Mucho gusto."}
{"text":"The food is not bad but it used to be better. I'm  not sure if it's just a new cook or just the quality of the food has changed.  The prices have also gone up. If you eat in the service is usually quick but most of the servers are not personable at all and a few have been almost rude. Also, don't ever order takeout. The last three times our order has been wrong or we were missing items we paid for.  Service used to be much better. Would not recommend  now."}
{"text":"I only came here to pickup lunch for my boss and coworker and ended up ordering for myself. I tried the chicken and rice soup and I must say it is an excellent soup!! Just a bit spicy with avocado on top and a good balance of chicken and rice. I will be back it's become a favorite soup!!"}
{"text":"We've been twice since moving here. The service is usually decent but the food is pretty standard. Salsa tastes out of a jar and good but overall just average. Doesn't satisfy my Mexican cravings at all but not bad."}
{"text":"Great place. If you live in Waxhaw (or close to) and if you 1. don't feel like driving to Cantina 1511 2. Want more authentic Mexican food or 3.  Want a more casual atmosphere, go here. There aren't many choices in South Charlotte, let alone Waxhaw/Ballentyne area and this place is great. Little dive bar, authentic food, nice staff. Oh yeah, and they do have a full bar. Not just beer and wine like the page says. Good margaritas!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is great, the majority if the staff is fantastic. Mauricio is not one if them. He is arrogant, and over steps. A waiter that does not know you should not call you baby. I ordered the lunch nachos and he brought fajitas. This was after waiting 15 minutes for him to take my order. When they came and i said I ordered the nachos his response was these are fajitas and you will like them. Unfortunately after waiting so long to order and for the food I could not wait to have it fixed. He disappeared again and myself and the gentleman across from me waited another 15 minutes to find him to get our checks. The other problem is that the kitchen staff tends to make things their way and not by the description on the menu. It may sound like i don't like the place but I really do. It is beautiful, they now have a full bar. If you go and get Mauricio ask for another server."}
{"text":"The new location is dark but nice. They have an outside area in front of a huge parking lots with people smoking. The food is not anything special and they wait staff is slow. The sauces are runny instead of creamy, as well as the beans. This is an okay restaurant, but you should really go to Andele! for a better experience."}
{"text":"Great service. Clean. Reasonable prices. Lots of seating. Lots of choices. The sweet tea last time was pretty bad ,tasted coffee ish but hey, this is Mexican food.... I shd have gotten a Corona or Victoria beer Otherwise this is a great place."}
{"text":"I will preface by saying I am not a huge Mexican food fan, however this place is pretty good.  The service is quick and friendly.  The portions are large and the prices reasonable. If you like mexican food, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I'm definitely loyal to Elvallarta - they've been in Waxhaw as long as I have. I know Mexican is hard to screw up, but everything I've ever had has been good. Fresh ingredients, friendly staff, made-to-order yummy margaritas that don't break the bank, all within walking distance of my house...what more do I need? Their service is usually very speedy and with reasonable prices, I can take the family out for a quick, economical meal that usually leaves me with 2nds (or 3rds) as leftovers. The outdoor seating is a nice option too. Just avoid on Cinco de Mayo when the place is PACKED."}
{"text":"Run of the mill Mexican.   Service was mediocre ... one dish was delivered ten minutes after the others with no apology or explanation.   Food was fine: not a problem, but nowhere near what you would call special.    El Vallarta is just there.  If you're in that area and craving basic Mexican, it serves its purpose.  Like most spots in Waxhaw, the Friday/Saturday evening wait times imply a better experience than the reality you will experience."}
{"text":"It started a little rocky with stale chips, but the rest of the food was bangin. The waitress had a little confusion about what chorizo is. Lol. I gave three stars because of the stale chips and the crappy mall location where we could see some punk kids fighting outside the mall entrance while we were eating."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Mexican. The food is delicious and always warm. The service is also fantastic, very friendly staff. Would reccomend!"}
{"text":"First time visit, quick service n good margaritas both meals were typical Mexican fare, nice atmosphere but a bit noisy. Would come back!"}
{"text":"So i came in like yeah mexican food and basically it was that but someone took a shit on it and put it in the microwave. There were so many flys i started to think i was at misquito orgy. The fajitia smelt like literal garbage and the wait for a reservation is like 6 hours. I could have like a family by the time we got to our seats"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced and always good food.  This place is a \"regular favorite\" of my family.  Staff is very friendly and courteous.  I don't think we've ever had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good price.  We love it here.  Super friendly management.  We frequent this place more than i would like to admit."}
{"text":"Wow... No reviews for this restaurant?  I had never liked Mexican food  before stopping here for lunch one day.... But then again, the only Mexican food that I had before eating here was at Chi-Chi's in Jersey... I know, it shouldn't even be in the same category..... This place is so good that I had taken friends from Concord and Charlotte here, and also turned my relatives from Alabama on to this place... First of all, the food is delicious.... The servings are huge... And the margaritas are some of the best that I've had to date... My favorite dishes here are the chicken burritos, tostadas with beef and cheese, and the huge spicy shrimp soup....  Being less than ten minutes from where I was living, this was one of my go to places for a can't disappoint meal.... The owners and servers were all great..."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Their table guac is the best. Cheap and waiters are friendly and helpful. Definitely underrated."}
{"text":"Many years ago when they first opened, they had some big issues that needed to be worked out. Regardless, we didn't return - until today. I am so glad that we did!  We were seated quickly, received thin-style chips (my favorite type!) and 2 salsas: spicy and mild. They also have one of the best menus that I have ever seen: it's huge, lots of options, and lots of pictures - which always helps!  Our service was good, and the food was excellent. I ordered Carne Asada and husband had Enchiladas Rancheras - both dishes were excellent."}
{"text":"Coupons are frequently found in Money Saver. We have never really used the carry out option, we always dine in. The service is friendly and food is good."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and well prepared, and the menu was very diverse. However, the waiter forgot to ring in my meal, and the food was delivered by the owner. I figured mine was on the way, but it never came even after our waiter came to refill my son's water without a glance at me or anyone else. Ten plus minutes later, the owner stopped by to ask how our meals were and I mentioned I hadn't received my food. A meal was quickly delivered but everyone else was already finished. We were never even asked if we wanted dessert or another drink but a ticket was dropped on our table, with no discount/comp on my forgotten meal.   Its a shame as this was my first and probably last meal there despite decent food.  We were clearly just another ticket to the waiter, as we just slipped out the door, unacknowledged."}
{"text":"Great margaritas and drink specials but the rest was nothing to write home about in either direction.    HOWEVER, the table side guacamole is a lingual delight and worth splurging on! Wish I could say more but I was just underwhelmed overall."}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday night.  Our top shelf margaritas were very watery.  The chips and salsa were not that great.  The salsa was pretty bland.  My husband enjoyed his taco and burrito combo, but my veggie fajitas were very oily."}
{"text":"Yes!!!!!! It's good Mexican. Who cares about presentation, because it actually tastes good! And to top it all off, they offer COKE products! That's unheard of at any \"el\" restaurant I've ever been to. I am so excited we found this little gem. The service was very fast and attentive. The atmosphere is fun and vibrant, but still perfect for family dinners. We will be back!"}
{"text":"One of the kids all time favorite cheese dip. It's always crowded and the staff does a great job getting you seated as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"Food was good. Definitely better than la unica. Gave it a 4 because the fajita nachos didn't have anything on top. Just chicken and cheese. I got the Dona taco dish. It was really good. My hubby got the steak. It was very juicy and flavorful. Service was great. Our server was Becky she was awesome."}
{"text":"I love a lot of things about this restaurant. First off, the staff is very friendly and always accommodating. The atmosphere is very relaxed even during lunch. It is not a fancy place but it is a great place for some good Mexican food and great service. I particularly enjoy the Chile Relleno when I go there but the quesadilla's and Burritos are also good."}
{"text":"There is truly no place like El Vallarta. The experience is like no other and begins with the best chips and salsa. All of the food is exquisite but a few highlights have to be the sizzling fajitas and amazing queso. Not only is the food great, but the service is too. The prices are totally reasonable and you won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Very nice lunch on a beautiful Carolina day! Good service, food came out fast, warm and very tasty. We ate outside, it was very clean. Brought out chip and salsa without a pause. Very helpful server, large servings. We will be back"}
{"text":"I find that Mexican restaurants can be hard for me to rate because I am so one-dimensional in what I order.  I'm a burrito and taco sort of guy.  El Vallarta delivers for me on those food dimmensions.    I remember my first visit, which consisted of multiple brisket tacos made to order.  Despite my poor choice of choosing hard shells, the meat was delicious.  Since then, the restaurant has become the family's de facto Mexican restaurant of choice.  Quality, speed, service (I never have to ask for refills as the glasses are typically topped up before I've had a chance to finish), and affordability.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Really bad experience at their new location at Carolina Mall, which is a shame, because I used to really like this place. Won't return."}
{"text":"El Vallarta in Monroe has a nice atmosphere and friendly staff.   I really like their food...it is standard american/mexican food...although some of their offerings look to be authenticly yucatan influenced. If you want a quick, cheap lunch or dinner, this place should definitely be on your radar!  My husband and I always split an entree...and, that is more than enough food for two adults! We also get the cheese dip as an appetizer!  My only real complaint is the margaritas...they are hit or miss, and often come without the alcohol! At one point my husband would walk to the bar and order our margaritas or make an excuse and go to the bar just to confirm our drink order. They were pouring our 'top shelf' margarita from a pitcher and tried to say it was all pre-mixed and pre-made...well, it did not have that same color the brandy adds to it and it definitely did not taste right!! We do not order mixed drinks anymore!!  This is a great casual place to enjoy dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable and a little nicer than most Mexican restaurants I've been to, but it's still pretty casual. I really like their seafood burrito. It's yummy! It's easy to find (right on the side of Roosevelt) and they have great dips."}
{"text":"Ive ate here lots of times and today was amazing!! I don't know what was different but it was the best it's ever been! Our food was on our table in less than 10 minutes too"}
{"text":"Exceptional! Service was good. Food was great! We had the shrimp diablo and tres fajitas. Both were very good. The margarita was weak but ok and there is no way to screw up a cold corona! We  recommend a stop here and we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible   Now I have to say that I'm pretty much an expert on Mexican food, and this place is store bought, Americanized fake Mexican.   While the staff is attentive as far as service, although there is lack of enthusiasm... The food totally did not do \"Mexican\" food justice.   First off the chips and salsa was horrendous. The chips were fake corn like chips and the salsa was that can junk... I could tell.  So I got my normal Nachos aaaaaaand I was annoyed. First of all... To get guacamole on the Surpreme... I had to pay $3.95. $3.95!!! For a little guac on my nachos. How annoying. The sour cream was weird tasting.. And worst of all, I didn't have enough cheese on my plate. Isn't that the point of \"Nachos\"??? The cheese?   I was highly disappointed.   My boyfriend and I would have been better off with going to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food for the price on a Wednesday afternoon. Atmosphere is very inviting and it's a good place to sit down and enjoy some above average Mexican food."}
{"text":"After our first few times here were amazing! Food was delicious, served hot and fast. My brisket taco was amazing!! Everyone raved about their meals. With a large family of 7 that rarely happens. Usually someone has a complaint. But we all left happy and full.  I was so excited to bring a friend visiting from out of town there for a quick dinner. It's always our tradition to go out for good Mexican food and then hit the movies. The dining room wasn't very full so I didn't think it would be a problem to get in and out so we could catch a movie 90 minutes later. I mentioned to the waitress that we were trying to catch a movie and she said that we would have no problem getting our food quickly as they weren't busy.  I ordered the same taco variety plate that I enjoyed so much the last time I was here, and it was terrible. We waited for a long time for our food... nearly 30 minutes after the 15 minutes it took to get drinks and have our order taken. My taco plate must have sat for a while before being served because the crunchy shells were like mush, so when I picked up the first taco it just fell apart. The meat was only lukewarm. My friend's fajitas were okay, but nothing special. We did enjoy the margarita special of the night.   Unfortunately by the time we got our check paid and my card returned to me it was too late to make the movie.  I'm all about second chances, thinking that the had an off night so when my daughter asked to go there for her birthday celebration, I said okay. To say that we had a bad experience is an understatement. We went for lunch around 1 pm and the place was practically empty. SCORE we thought! We will get served really quickly, because my 6 yo was beginning to get hangry.   We had a party of 7 and we have been going out to restaurants for many, many years so I understand there CAN be challenges to get the food out to everyone at the same time, but we waited 20 minutes after the first entree was delivered for the last one to be served. And OF COURSE it was my 6 yo's food. Thankfully they brought over a couple of bowls of chips to tide her over.   While we waited for the food I ordered a margarita on the rocks, and the first one they brought me was disgusting. I think they forgot to add lime juice. The waitress came over and I explained that the drink was very bad and she apologized and went to get me another one. She brought back what I hope was a fresh drink. I took a sip, it was okay so I took another sip and then found two fruit flies floating around with the ice cubes. I guess I should be thankful I didn't swallow them, unless of course they invited friends to the party that I didn't know about!  The food for everyone rated from okay to barely eatable. My 10 yo who would live on a steady diet of crunchy tacos every day if I let her, had one bite and couldn't eat anymore. The veggies for my 15 yo's steak fajita looked like they had seen better days and she said they had an off taste. Both girls felt sick later on that afternoon.   After the last entree was dropped off at the table the waitress never came back to our table to ask use how we were doing. In fact it seemed like all the waitstaff was gone. So I finally asked the hostess for the check and we left.   I'm very sad that what started off as a great place to eat has declined so much in the past few months. We won't be back. Now we travel out of town for really good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Very busy, so go early! The owner is so friendly and personable and always makes us feel welcome! The only negative is making reservations for large groups...."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch on a Thursday in the summer and sat outside. The service was incredibly fast and outstanding! The waitress had my drink and food to me within 5 minutes! They give you chips and two types of salsa as a free app and a minute later your meal is out! I ordered the Vanessa Special off their lunch menu which is rice, salad, and two enchiladas with cheese sauce. DELICIOUS! And very inexpensive, only $5.95! I will definitely be returning to this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service.  Small reception area makes it difficult to get in and out.  May be a concern if evacuation was necessary."}
{"text":"The service was great. Unfortunately, the food isn't. The entire place has a general run down feel to it and smells of BO. The salsa is a step above tomato sauce. And the burrito arrived soggy with puddles of water already accumulating along the edges of the plate.   It was fast. But surprisingly pricey - especially for lunch. $9.95 for a veggie burrito?!  Not a repeater for me."}
{"text":"Tortilla soup was great, but nachos are sloppy, soggy mess. Cheese dip is also very good. Good to go service."}
{"text":"Very fast and nice service. The menu is a bit overwhelming, but they have lot of tasty options. Possibly the best true Mexican food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Always good food. Great service. It's our \"go to\" place for drinks and eating out in Waxhaw !!!"}
{"text":"Really good good and service. Eduardo the owner is always around to see that customers are happy. They are the best go to Mexican restaurant in the area. No complains here at all. Prices are very fair and food portions are huge!  I def recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Me and a co-worker were in town on business and just looking for a quick place for a cheap bite. We stumbled upon this place and decided you couldn't go wrong with Mexican. Overall, good impression from start to finish of the meal. The service was prompt and friendly. The food was was basic Mexican fare with no frills. The prices were reasonable, the food was good, atmosphere was pleasant and the margaritas were cheap and strong. Exactly what I expected when I walked in, so I left satisfied."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick supper and had the carne asado tacos and one grilled chicken taco.  The carne tacos were super. Chicken was bland. Beautiful presentation on authentic colorful plates. Bill was $14 and I gave waiter a $20 and he asked if I wanted change. Ummmm yeah so I just paid $20 for three tacos."}
{"text":"Next to Speedy Gonzalez in the dictionary is a group picture of this staff. I was greeted at the door by a host in mid trot. As I was seated a food runner arranges chips, salsa, and queso with the speed and precision of a Speedway put crew. Amazing speed. When I asked for some hot sauce, I did get an eye roll. None the less, it came just the same. The salsa is very mild. The hot sauce is not from a bottle. It's got good flavor and medium heat with a hint of smoke. The food its self is average."}
{"text":"Ok, i come in thinking oh yes fajitas baby and all i got was a plate of disappointment, they bring us wings with no plates, i get my fajitas no beans, bugs all over the table i couldn't even finish my meal, my rice was cold very disappointed in this place don't come here"}
{"text":"Best Mexican to date since I moved here 5 months ago.  Had the Fajita's with chicken, steak and shrimp.  Thursdays special, and it was the best fajita's I can remember eating, ever.  Recommended, highly."}
{"text":"I am so happy we tried this place and didn't write it off as some crappy chain.  The food is really good here, I think there has been one item I didn't like out of at least 10 visits.  They get packed but the staff tries their best to get you in and seated quickly.  The chips and salsa are tasty and refilled as often as you'd like.  They always seem to have a 1/2 pitcher margarita special, which in good.  The shrimp fajitas are great, they come piled on top of sautéed onions, green peppers and tomatoes.  And they don't taste like they are cooked in a lot of oil.  My have though is the ranchero special.  Its shrimp and chicken with onions, mushrooms, green pepper and tomato on a bed of rice and covered with a melted cheese.  Healthy?  No.  Delicious?  Absolutely!!  The portions are large, the prices are low.  All in all a great place to grab a bite in Waxhaw!!"}
{"text":"I like that they make the guacamole fresh at your table.  The new location is much nicer. I like the steak fajitas but not the refried beans."}
{"text":"Excellent food.... Big portions and good service... Also a great atmosphere to hang out..."}
{"text":"We go here all the time.  We've ate at the other Mexican restaurants in town and El Vallarta is the best."}
{"text":"Celebrated a good friends birthday at the location and I really can't complain about the food or the service. The margaritas were great and it's authentic as it gets."}
{"text":"The salsas were interesting.  The salsa verde in particular was pretty good.  Service was prompt and friendly.  I order a combination plate with an enchilada, chile poblano (chile stuffed with jack), rice and beans.  Rice and beans were average.  The chile was *not* dipped in egg wash and then fried.  The enchilada tasted like something from a frozen dinner.  Everything was also _very_ salty.  They have a lot of seafood dishes on their menu, but they also have wings, go figure.  I might come back once more to make sure my dining experience wasn't a fluke; otherwise, I will not be back.  To use some of my spanglish, El Blech-o"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great prices(minus the 'to go' charge)! This is a family run restaurant and they literally will bend over backwards to ensure you have received excellent service. Twice we were sitting at the window as the sun was going down and the waiter/waitress went outside with a plastic table cloth, a ladder and taped it up over my window. THAT my friends is how you get life long customers!"}
{"text":"Great place to swing by for tacos and beer. Food is delicious. Prices are good. Service is great.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good Mexican..... I was happy with the quality and quantity of food presented for the money. The surprise was the White Queso cheese dip. WOW!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot! They have so many lunch menu options. Each day there is a special as well. As soon as you sit, they give you warm chips and salsa. They have a full bar and several Tvs to enjoy the game.  I always order the. Fajitas burrito with chicken and add cheese sauce on top."}
{"text":"This place was packed and we still received outstanding service. The fajitas were amazing. I love supporting this local business."}
{"text":"I'm sooo disappointed in their food, since I received such killer service here! Also I'm really impressed by their sanitation score, 99%, always nice to see a clean restaurant. I called in for a pick up, the girl on the line was so sweet & cheerful! She told me it'll be ready in 15 mins and when I arrived it sure was. I even received an 10% discount since I worked in the mall(: I ordered the salmon avocado & mango salad and the fish tacos. First off what is going on w/ my salmon, it's super duper dry & it looks like it's been sitting out for days. It even has the weird fishy smell to it ekk! The fish tacos weren't as bad, but it was also super dry!?? The rice & beans were alright. Salsa- kinda watery. Best part has got to be the tortilla chips. They packed us a VERY generous amount of chips too, yasss! But overall I'm just super sad that the food didn't work out for me, since it's located in such a convenient spot for me AND the service was on point! (Also the sweet ladies gave me an discount card for employees, who doesn't love a good discount??) Maybe they had an off day in the kitchen? Don't know but I'll probably give it another try again, just going to stay away from the fish next time lol!"}
{"text":"Man, they need to train/educate the wait staff!! The clueless Valley Mex Girls are just plain ass lost!! Waitress sat at the bar talking for a good while before taking our order. We were about to bolt! She comes over, takes our order, then comes back twice more to verify the order. Asking questions that were just obvious. Food is not anything special. If you desire Mexican cuisine, go to Andele... Its the best in the Concord/Kannap area!!"}
{"text":"Is this a gourmet mexican restaurant?  No.  Is it some of the best mexican food I've ever eaten? No.  Is it a good, cheap place to go eat lunch?  Yes.  My office is located about 2 miles from El Vallarta.  My co-workers and I take a trip for lunch once or twice a month.  The service is ok.  They give you chips and salsa, as well as a queso and bean dip.  Although the food isn't anything to write home about, it is fairly cheap.  They have great lunch time specials.  I usually get the fajitas, which is $5.95 (I think)...and they are actually pretty good.  So, like another reviewer posted, I probably wouldn't recommend someone to make a trip to Concord simply to dine here, but I would suggest it for a lunch-time visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the staff are very quick and very nice the manager is a great guy got to sit and speak with him. So I have almost tried everything on there lunch menu and I can say I have yet to be disappointed the food is amazing."}
{"text":"We love this place. Food is always good, plentiful and inexpensive. Go on Tuesdays for Taco Tuesday's."}
{"text":"First time here with dining mates. Friendly, attentive service,packed for Friday night dinner. Extensive menu, reasonable prices. We ordered the white cheese dip, yummy with the taco chips that normally comes with 2  red salsas.  Dinners: Fajita burrito,  stuffed with chicken, rice, beans, vegetables with guacamole salad and sour cream, 2 Ranchero specials, one over rice another over black beans, we chose shrimp and chicken combo  served with mushrooms, onions, peppers, tomatoes with a nacho cheese sauce. We also ordered a  fruity sangria drink. Everything plated nicely and hot Everything was delicious. We will certainly return."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Their lunch menu is very extensive, and the prices are reasonable. I had the chicken fajita taco salad which was very tasty! Hubby had the chicken flautas which he said were the best he's ever had. Our son got beef nachos and he didn't think they were as good as they normally are, but the plate was huge! The service is friendly but a little spotty. I don't believe your drink glass should ever get empty. I gave four stars because, to me, the food was great!"}
{"text":"Great food. The salsa tastes good. Staff is friendly. Everything is affordable."}
{"text":"This was really really good, honestly the best cheese sauce I've had in years. Worth the trip down to Waxhaw."}
{"text":"2nd visit tonight and the top shelf margarita was great. The chicken  fajitas were very good.   Very good service and food.   I will be back."}
{"text":"This is my second visit and brought my friend and his family on his birthday, I was so disappointed, the service was horrible and they didn't even care to serve what we ordered. He never got his drink that he ordered, and they put beef in the kids tacos when we specifically asked for beans, then they forgot to put lettuce and tomatoes in the tacos..... The corn on the cob was cold and friend's fajitas was served first without the tortillas and she got the tortillas at the  end after everyone was served. Terrible service and was so embarrassed and disappointed, would never go again."}
{"text":"I had a craving for enchiladas and wound up here.  I'm glad I did. The enchiladas supreme with white queso sauce. It was amazing!  My wife got a taco salad and was satisfied with it.  I like this place much better since they relocated to the mall.  The prices were fair and the service was good."}
{"text":"Lunch time bargain time. Quick quick quick and hot hot hot. Big portions and low prices. I had the chicken fajita and chips with salsa. They give you several different salsas to try, a bit watery but fresh and tasty. The place is a bit dark and dingy, the bar is small. Overall I think this place has great food and great service. Winner."}
{"text":"Great service and the food is very good.   They now have a new salsa that they serve in lieu of the meat/cheese dip and although we miss the free beef and cheese dip the new salsa is a hit."}
{"text":"Have I had better? Yes, but solid Mexican food here. It's definitely the best option close to us (we have also tried Los Aztecas and Don Juilio's)"}
{"text":"So thankful to have found this little gem close to home. Service was fast, food was tasty & margaritas where cheap but still delicious! $3.99 for a small $7.99 for a large.  We ordered a fajita dish for two. I can't remember the name but it was $24 for 2 & we have so much food left over. It came with skirt steak cooked to perfection & tender, grilled strip & chicken. It was seriously soooo goood!  I was so hungry I forgot to take a picture. Sorry about that. Take my word for it though. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy this place at all. We're on the road and stopped to get some food. Decided this place. Margaritas were alright. I got these El Dona something.. Beer battered chicken tacos. Sounded good, but when I got it the tacos the, I'm assuming corn tortilla, was cold and soggy. The chicken was kind of warm. The sauce was tasteless and cold. The thing that got me the most is that my boyfriend and I were wondering if they gave me seafood instead of chicken. But no. It was chicken. It just tasted terrible, And at two bites and I had to stop. It was just aweful. I hope it stays down. Service wasn't very good. Food wasn't good. I wouldn't go back nor recommend it to anyone. But that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"I lived in Los Angeles for 30 years so my critique of Mexican food is pretty biased. With that in mind, about the only thing that was good here was the iced tea. The tortillas are store bought and not fresh. The salsa and chips were also out of a box as was the refried beans. The pork al pastor was bland and had big chunks of fat. There HAS to be better mexican food in NC. I hope i can find it."}
{"text":"The only Mexican restaurant we go to in waxhaw! Everything is amazing from the atmosphere, the staff, the food, the amazing drinks, and the price. If you order a margarita it actually tastes like an authentic margarita! We always leave stuffed, and very satisfied! I always recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"We've been eating at this place for years and I always? forget to review it so here goes.   We haven't been here in a little over a year, since they moved across the street. I was a bit worried because sometimes when restaurants move buildings the food somehow is never quite the same but that isn't the case at El Vallarta.   We went for lunch and found many delicious specials. Most under $8. I decided on Pollo Fundido and my wife had The Vanessa Special which is chicken enchiladas. My food was delicious as always they have the best rice in town! My wife cleaned her plate so I'm gonna say she enjoyed her dish as well.  The restaurant has a good atmosphere. Full bar and a few TV's if you don't wanna miss a game.  Everyone on staff is really polite and helpful if you've never been there before. Not quite as authentic as some other places I have been to but it's still really good Mexican food!   Give it a try you won't regret it! They also offer brunch on Staurday and Sunday afternoons. Gonna have to give that a try as well!"}
{"text":"Typical Mexican Restaurant nothing extraordinary!  Food is ok, but the service is horrendous!!! And that begins with the hostess!!  Seemed almost hostile and definitely more friendly to latino patrons over others (or maybe it was just us)!  As she seated us she snidely said \"your welcome\" before we even said thank you! Was it us? :(  When our waiter finally came and we gave him our order... of course there was something wrong with my order when it came to the table--but of course, he never came back and with the slowness of the food coming out anyway I definitely didn't want to make everyone wait!  We haven't visited this restaurant in over a year -- everytime we do.  The service is HORRIBLE!  There are way way too many mexican restaurants that have wonderful food and service, I'm shocked this place is still around, then again they do give preferential treatment to certain customers so that might be it!  Keep driving, who needs this aggravation!?"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food and ambiance in the area.  From the standard fare to the traditional regional foods of Mexico. Great drinks and much more"}
{"text":"They no longer give you the meat/bean/cheese dip for free.. which bums out a lot of people. I guess the economy nose dive hit everyone in its own special way. Doesn't bother me too much, since I like just plain cheese dip and always ordered it separate anyway, but don't go looking for the free stuff anymore. You can order some for about $3 if you really miss it.   The food is still the best! Get something with steak, it's delish! My friend ordered something that looked sooo good. I wish I could remember the name of the dish, but it had shrimp, steak and chicken over rice and covered with melted white cheese.. omg it looked sooo good. She said it was the best dish she'd had there!"}
{"text":"Good food and service.  The jumbo Margarita was a bit weak today, but usually excellent.  Overall good value for money."}
{"text":"Good specialty . On Tuesdays they are $2.50. Clean place with a nice ambiance. Great staff  our chips and drinks were constantly replenished. Our waiter Antonio constantly checked on us even asked if we needed togo drinks."}
{"text":"If you are looking for decent Mexican that comes out quickly, come to this restaurant. Chips and salsa are fantastic. It can get busy on Friday night and Saturday night, however traffic moves quickly. Chips and salsa are fantastic, and so are he shrimp fajitas. It seems like takeout is very popular here."}
{"text":"The margaritas are awesome, the food OK and the service absolutely HORRIBLE.  We have given this place more than 1 chance (been there 3Xs in the past month or so) and this review is consistent.  Last night we even watched a couple walk out after 10 min of waiting for someone to greet their table after being seated.  If we go back for margaritas we'll at least go in eyes wide open expecting service to be bad...."}
{"text":"Food was great, prices very reasonable, service excellent despite being very busy.  Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Great night! Best margaritas I've had in a while and the service was so friendly we didn't want to leave. Had Margaritas, Enchiladas, Salads, wings and queso.  We ate it so quick we didn't take any pictures. Great food and great service!! BIG FAN"}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I come in I'm greeted like I was a long-lost family member. The salsa is great, but eat it fast cause they service the food quickly. The taco salad is good and so are the fish tacos. The Chicken Tortilla soup if the best."}
{"text":"Consistently awesome mexican food. I love their tamales. Very generous portions. I took away 1 star because it always smells faintly of sewage inside. I suspect they have a plumbing issue"}
{"text":"First off, customer service is out of this world! Our table of 8 was assigned to a room meant for group parties, but we asked to be relocated since the room felt cramped. Once moved to a different table in the main eating area, we had two different waitresses. Lily ordered our drinks and another waitress ordered our food.   I ordered the Hawaiian Quesadilla with a side of a rice and beans. Who would've thought that pineapples would be delicious in a quesadilla? The food was delicious and I enjoyed every bit of it. Be sure to order their table side guac, it's made fresh.   As the sun started to go down, one side of our table became blinded by the sun. When our table tried to figure out what to do, our waitress and other nearby staff said they would figure something out. One of the staff named Jose went to the outside of the window with a black plastic bag and covered up the window as much as possible. Our table clapped for his clever thinking and we enjoyed the rest of our dinner.    I can't say enough about the customer service that night. It was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Service was great food was fantastic and the pitcher of margarita for 9 bucks was phenomenal! It's kinda of the beaten path but easy to navigate!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is a better bet. Coming from California I have high standards for Mexican food. This place puts spaghetti sauce on their enchiladas???!!!  My husbands burrito was horrendous. And the kids quesadillas were nasty. If you want true authentic Mexican head to the taco truck parked on Providence Rd next to the Goodwill truck."}
{"text":"The fajitas were great!  Service was a little slow...the sizzling plate came out and we had to wait as they brought out the rest a few minutes later."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a kid, over 14 years. I moved out of NC and still come here every time I'm back. Love this place."}
{"text":"I went in there for a quick bite to eat and it turned out to be an ordeal. There wasn't really anyone in there but it took a long time for my order to come along and when it did the food was cold and just plain."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good and has top notch service. With chips I would recommend their guacamole jalapeño salsa and their spicy salsa, which is just tasty. Staff is extremely friendly as well."}
{"text":"Wow!  Such a different experience than the last visit.. Great food and Excellent Service.. although, I didn't get to try the margaritas as we had the kids with us, but definitely next visit!  IMO the evening service is WAY better than the day shift, but we came on a Sunday, after church, the last time.  Patty, our waitress, was incredibly nice and attentive the entire meal!  We will be coming back soon.."}
{"text":"The waitress with the tattoos is awesome. Friendly, attentive, and personable. Great service  and good food that's Affordable come here  every week. Offer specials on food and drink nightly.   Clean restrooms, too. ."}
{"text":"If you like Americanized Mexican food and an underwhelming friendly staff then this is the place for you.  Me, I prefer authentic food and service."}
{"text":"The service was prompt and friendly. This is s good place if you are looking for Mexican food. It is not Tex-Mex. they also have a good selection for kids."}
{"text":"I really used to like this place but we were very surprised tonight when we both ordered full meals, and my friend ordered another meal to go in addition to her meal.  They CHARGED a surcharge for take out.    When she questioned the manager he got rather rude and told her that the take out containers cost him money.  He then called her \"sweetheart\" in a condescending way.  Who charges a surcharge for containers for take out?  And if they do, they need to put it clearly onto their menu!  There was no mention of any additional charge for take out!  We will not return."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Monday night around 6:30 with my wife.  It was pretty busy.  We were seated after a few minutes.  Service was good and server was friendly.  Ordered the table side guacamole which was okay.  I ordered a chicken enchilada dish with a poblano sauce, and my wife got the shrimp enchiladas.  Both dishes looked good, but came out cold, and not only lacked in flavor, but were very skimpy on the proteins inside.   Not sure why this place gets so much love, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place quite a few times and unless you are in the Concord/Kannapolis area, I wouldn't necessarily rec commend El Vallarta.  It just so happened that I was in the Concord area last night so a few of us decided to try this mexican place.  I wasn't overly impressed but I wasn't completely disappointed...hence the 3 star rating.  What I liked:  The decor was vibrant and festive..just like a Mexican place should be.  The staff seemed to speak slim to no english, which made for an authentic experience.  The margaritas were perfectly blended and delicious.  The portions were large and in charge.  I ordered a veggie burrito and it was pretty tasty.  It looked like a huge whale slapped on my plate but it was good.  The veggies were pretty fresh and no one flavor dominated the rest of the burrito.  Overall, it was good.  I also like the fact that with the complimentary salsa they offer a cheese and bean dip.  It is literally beans stirred in a white queso...it was very tasty.  The salsa was the kind served out of a caraf...it was pretty good as well.    What I didn't like:  The tableside guacamole wasn't very good.  I mean, how can you mess up fresh guacamole?  Well, for starters you could add way too many jalapenos and that is exactly what they did.  It was like a jalapeno dip...it was just not very good..I don't know how else to say it.  I know that can change depending on who makes it but this was just not done well.  My friend wasn't crazy about his tacos...the shells were a little stale and he didn't feel there was enough meat and lettuce on the taco.  The rice was pretty good but the beans were just okay.  I would like to give this another try and order a few other things.  I think there is good potential.  Right now I am on the fence but again...if you are in the area I think it is worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexican restaurant the food is more on the traditional mexican style.  They are the perfect combination of flavors and textures, cheap and excellent food. I'm extremely picky about Mexican food and this place is the only one I've ever been for real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Three words. Top shelf margarita! You HAVE to try one. We didn't know about this hidden jewel and started with sangria and mango margaritas. Both were good but the sangria didn't have a whole lot of flavor despite the abundance of fruit. Our awesome waitress, Asuzzana (I probably butchered the spelling), introduced us to what is now our favorite drink here! And drink prices are wonderful!!!  I wasn't too hungry so I chose the nachos (regular ones) and added cilantro. They were very good and the portion size was amazing. The beef was chopped really fine and flavored well. Not sure what the cheese sauce on it was but it, too, had a great flavor. I did also add beans to mine. Gotta have beans, right.   Our son thoroughly enjoyed his kids' burrito. With two sides, he was left stuffed from just a kids' meal.   The atmosphere is fun and lively here. We were extremely surprised that our party of six was seated immediately at 7pm on a Friday night!   We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Standard mexican food i guess. The large beers were a good deal. I don't know about the other posts that say its really cheap. Not bad though all in all."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a while & always have a good experience.  Chicken fajitas, various types of nachos & salads.  Those are my go to & never bad."}
{"text":"Very good.  Cheap beer specials and good food."}
{"text":"I've came here for years. Over the past year the service has became AWFUL! If the food wasn't so good I wouldn't even return."}
{"text":"Great food, new location is very nice. My only complaint is that the wait staff is a little slow."}
{"text":"First time here in a really long time. For it being a Saturday night it was not very busy. Food was good and ur waiter was very courteous and helpful with our requests and questions. Had the chicken tortilla soup to start off with. Got a huge  bowl of it. Was a lot bigger serving than expected. Dinners were good and decent sized. Also had the fried ice cream for dessert. All in all it was a good meal and will go back to this place again and try other menu items"}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner on the way back to south Carolina, and it was not the best. Like one other said taco bell would be about the same if not better. I had the ranchero it came in a bed of watery tomato soap along with several spoon fulls of grease. Wont be coming bavk."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch at the recommendation of a friend. The service was so friendly and accommodating!  Had the lunch tacos and by far the best carne asada tacos in this region!!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Simply awesome!  ¡Muy bien!  Me ganta mucho.  ooy yoy yoy!  The staff are by far probably some of the most professional, and most awesome in the mexican food business I have seen!  I've even found that they have things there which normally you don't see in the states very often.  for example, I asked for horchata and they actually have it, and let me tell you what!  It is amazing!  I think the only thing there they have that I didn't like was the tres leches.  Basically it's cake made with condensed milk, and two other types of milk, but I don't remember exactly.  Wikipedia it if you want to know more.  It wasn't very moist, which I hear it's supposed to be very much so.  It was kind a gross.  Now, there churros?  And let me be very clear here, I don't mean churros in how people from Honduras would classify it, or such.  I'm not speaking of snacks, like chips, etc.  I mean the true definition of churros, like the real sugary pasteries... anyway... they are absolutely to die for!  They have some of the best carne asada... (grilled beaf...) as well as pollo asado... (grilled chicken...) that I've ever had!  I don't know what they season it with... garlic, black pepper, or what, but oh, sweet! Jesus!  My mouth is almost drewling just  thinking about it!  When you get your food, it's not just barely above room temperature like 99% of the restaurants I know do things.  Not that there is an issue with that as long as it's hot enough to kill bacteria, which 99.999 percent the time, it is.  Instead however, at El Vallarta, it is piping hot!  And I, mean, hot hot hot!  I mean, I can take a good deal of heat, but this stuff even has to cool down for me!  I mean, it literally comes out sizzling!  It is incredible!  Oh! my goodness!  I've spoken a few times with the manager, and he is just! as nice! as he can be!  If you don't know much about mexican food, they're extremely willing to teach you, and work with you.  I am actually trying to learn to speak spanish.  I don't think I've found even one single staff member in that whole place that is not 100% fluent.  They all speak perfect english, don't worry, but they're very very patient.  Even though it would be much easier for me to order in english, I remind them every time I go in, that I want to conduct as much as I can in spanish, and only use English if it be absolutely necessary.  When they say something that either vocab wise trips me up, or gramatically I don't know how to conjegate etc. correctly, they don't go to english and if I still don't get it, just walk away and give me time to figure it out.  they literally once stood there at my table for 15 minutes nonstop, granted they hardly had anyone in there, I think we were the only people dining right then, but still, they stood there, and didn't even get irritated nor impatient.  they worked with me step by step until I was totally able to say what I needed to in spanish without stumbling.  I thought that was so awesome of them, I actually tipped our waiter a few bucks extra that day just for being so willing to work with me and not give up on me.  They actually commended me for trying.  The chips and salsa you get with the meal is awesome!  The salsa is quite spicy, but they do have a mild kind if you need it.  You'll probably have to ask for it, as they normally don't bring it out, but it's there if you need it.  Also try their tangerine refresco.  It's a carbonated nonalcoholic obviously, soda flavered like tangerine oranges.  It's to die for!  Just know, no free refills on it, as it's in a glass bottle.  I'd strongly! recommend going here if you want a night out with great mexican food, and very friendly staff!"}
