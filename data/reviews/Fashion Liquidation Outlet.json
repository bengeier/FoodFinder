{"text":"Great place for kids clothing. I found a few outfits for my little one. I usually buy clothes that are a little bit bigger on him so he has time to wear them more. Downside was they didn't have any 24 months clothing the day I went but had great selection of 18 months. Plus I found a 2t shirt that I am sure will fit now but if not, soon. I found what I was looking for which was pjs for him but got him two other adorable outfits. My husband looked at the men's area but didn't find anything. He is pretty picky though. I didn't have time to look at the woman's area much. Little man started getting fussy. I will definitely be coming back for new clothing for my son."}
{"text":"Overall not a bad experience.  It was a bit of a drive from central Phoenix but I did manage to pick up a men's blazer and cardigan as well as a dress for my daughter all for around $12.00!  It's true that everything in the store is only $3.99.  They also pick one item daily to run at .99 cents.  It looked like most everything was first quality, I didn't see any damaged items.  The signs say the items are department store close outs, however it is important for you to know that 80% of the stuff was Target private labels like Mossimo and Merona.  There were also some K-mart private labels as well.  Still great clothes for a great price so if you are a Target fan definitely hit them up.  The reason why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the small selection of menswear.  There was no denim in men's but full racks of it in women's.  Other than that I think it's a decent store and I will be back.  Staff was also friendly and the store was neat and well merchandised!"}
{"text":"Everything really is $3.99 here, no exceptions! Great selection of brand new clothing (especially women's). Most of the clothes are from Target with tags attached or other labels. This warehouse is clean, organized, and has multiple dressing rooms. There are great deals and treasures to be found here. Located in the same plaza as The Dump/Costco. Definitely worth a trip here!"}
{"text":"Come prepared to spend some time in this store and you have to be in the mood to peruse the multitude of racks.  The clothes are organized by size. It would be nice if there were more organization such as a section for swim wear, athletic apparel, dress shirts, tshirts.   A lot of items are from Target which i have no issues with but a lot are direct from China with very poor quality.   The best deals i found were swimsuites and athletic apparel from Target.   Its a good store to come shop ocassionaly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I make a drive out to this store once a month, I live in Goodyear. Everything is $3.99 and they always have great a selection."}
{"text":"I don't shop anywhere else for clothes anymore since I found this place, the clothes is new quality and all clothes is 3.99 no matter what kind of clothes it is and they have kid clothes as well. I highly recommend shopping here. I must also add that the staff shows true customer service.."}
