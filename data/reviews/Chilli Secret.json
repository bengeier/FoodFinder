{"text":"Located just by Time Square, Chili secrets gets lots of traffic for both lunch and dinner service. It serves up a fusion of Cantonese, Szechuan and Shanghai cuisines. 

The restaurant is a decent size, but like most Chinese dim sum places, they don't offer too much space between tables. The decor is relatively clean and simple, but they definitely tried to add in some character with  the nicer chair covers, chandeliers, and faux coconut trees.

The great thing about this place is that they have lots of vegetarian options. Because we had a vegetarian with us that day, we had less meat dishes than usual. 

We ordered Tofu thread noodles, Tofu Rice Noodle Roll, Spinach Dumplings, Pumpkin Glutinous Dumplings, Spicy Cow tendons, Beef Fried Noodle, Pork Shui Mai, and Red Bean Pankcake (Wo Beng).

Pumpkin Glutinous Dumplings. 
--The dumplings were made with that has pumpkin mixed into it, giving a bright orange colour and a sweet hint of pumpkin. 
--It is filled with a red bean paste that did not overpower the rest of the dumpling. 
--they were piping hot with a nice crispy exterior, it easily became my favourite dish of the meal!

Tofu Thread Noodles:
Because tofu itself is often watery in nature, in order to make noodles out of it, it would have to be relatively dried. The texture ended up being a dry and spongey texture. I can't tell if I liked it or not, but it was definitely a different noodle experience.

Spinach Dumplings:
--the spinach dumplings were a nice twist on a commonly omivorous dish
--filled with tofu curds, vegetables, glass noodles and other non-meat ingredients
--I found it a bit salty, but that might be to compensate the fact that vegetables generally aren't as flavourful as meat 

If you ever want to come here for dim sum, you should come before 11am, they have a cheaper per dish dim sum rate. But be warned, you might be waiting for a table for quite a bit!"}
{"text":"Up until last Sunday, I've only had dim sum at Chili Secret. I came here with my family and we ordered the set meal things (again I can't read Chinese so... yeah)

Besides the waitress spilling tea all over my grandma, the food was SO salty and very msg-y. All of it was like that... so I didn't really eat much that night. It really wasn't good..

So the verdict: Come here for dim sum but please, don't eat here for dinner...."}
{"text":"They have 2 dishes I cannot get enough of - Szechuan Dan Dan Noodle & Bean Curd Thread Salad. Addictive!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner.. my girlfriend's family ordered the food.. none of which I liked..  The Lamb stew wasn't tender enough. If you're not familiar with the dishes, be careful of what you order as the dish may come drenched in a base of oil.  Perhaps there's some better dishes they have so the remainder of comments are based on service.

Chinese restaurants aren't known for great service and maybe they were understaffed tonight but this set a new low.  It took multiple requests to get white rice and it took forever (how does that make sense in a Chinese restaurant?) and multiple requests to get a coke, and extra napkins.

I will not go back again....."}
{"text":"once, twice, thrice

yeah that's how many times i'm going to review this place. i'm giving it a fair shot. 

on sunday went here for dim sum. and we arrived just after 12.30pm  surprisingly we didn't need to wait and got a table near the front of the restaurant. 


there's push cart and a la carte dim sum service. but mainly it's a la carte though. 

i wasn't feeling overly hungry for lunch that day, so no bias's of everything tasting good. i came here with an open mind. :) 

we ended up ordering our goods off the a la cart menu


sponge cake - kind of dry
siu mai shrimp and pork - average 
rice noodle beef roll - good but i haven't had anyone mess this up
dumpling (pork and leek) - too much leek

took a little bit long to get everything, there were some extended periods of time before the next dish came out (5-10mins).  

$20 for 2 people at $10 a person not bad for 4 dishes including tax+tip

but would i recommend coming here?  not the best place for dim sum imho. 
unique for it's Sichuan selections though that would be it.  

i think i'll stop reviewing this place now. as I gave it a fair shake. lol"}
{"text":"Some dishes great, some dishes just ok. While I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for dim sum, I would consider returning for their more northern style specialties, like all things with spice.

True to their name, they certainly know how to turn up the heat especially on their Dan Dan noodles. 

They also have this giant ceramic urn thingy in the corner, that one can easily mistaken for the decor, but I'm told it's brewing soup. Curious, very curious."}
{"text":"Used to be a super cheap pace to get dimsum and a quick lunch, but recently, they stopped their Cantonese dimsum - likely the chef is gone? So the food selection has really shrunk."}
{"text":"When fully packed, this is one of those places where you wish you spoke the language. You're waiting in line for 15 minutes, someone comes in, they talk, and then they get immediate seating. I start thinking, do they have reservations? Do they know the owner? Are they sisters? Did she slip in $20 for a table? You suddenly just wanna get outta there.

I stuck around and ended up sharing a round table with 2 more couples which was barely an ideal situation. We got all sorts of dim sum which were pretty good but hardly the best. Their menu is huge sadly I could only taste a few stuff. Best thing out of this experience was the mango dessert you can get from those push carts going round the place.

I would never come back peak hours ever again. Maybe 4pm on a Tuesday for dinner."}
{"text":"Weirdd, I gotta disagree.. I liked their food and the service was very good maybe because my friend frequented the place.. But the staff is really friendly :) and the sichuan dishes were authentic! I guess i had a different experienc since I didn't go there for the dim sum but rather the actual dishes."}
{"text":"One night the whole family was there for dinner, the following dishes were ordered:

Beef with Stir-fried Onion
Stir-fried Fish with Vegetables
Hot Pot Stir-fry
Sweet and Sour Chicken
Sesame and Sugar Coated Taro
Eight Treasure Rice
Yeung Chow Fried Rice
Seafood Soup
Sweet Sticky Rice Ball Soup (dessert)

We loved the dishes however, we waited a long time since the place was packed.  Instead of the main courses, they started off with the desserts.  We had to ask several times for the waiters to bring us our meal.  

I suggest you go there early as 5:30 PM for dinner so that there are less people and you can enjoy a savory Sichuan dinner without interruption."}
{"text":"Nothing super special about this place, but I am giving this place 4 stars because an average dim sum place in the east end is worthy of at least 3 stars especially when you are from Mississauga.

What I really like about this place;

-dim sum is made to order 
-northern dim sum as well (pork soup dumplings, xiao long bao, etc.)

-price: it is either 2.20 or 2.50 for regular dim sum on weekdays and weekends respectively.  Considering it's made to order, it is a great price as other places with the one price for all items are push cart and it is luck of the draw.

Order: hao gaw,siu Mai, fried squid, spare ribs and chicken with mushroom rice, soup dumplings, deep fried stuffed taro,

My favourite was the Taro.  So much filling and so crispy.

So overall:

Ambiance: 4/5 (considering its dim sum)
Food: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Price: 5/5
Value: 4/5

Overall, pretty good food and the best part is that my girl's place is next door,"}
{"text":"After driving by this place a number of times, we decided to try it. They do take reservations for larger parties, and they are usually very busy.

I don't know enough about Chinese Cuisine completely define what they do, but it did taste very 'authentic'.

Naturally the cooking featured chilies and lots of them.  We ordered a chicken dish that featured both chilies and star anise. It was delicious. We also ordered the cripy beef, which was fried, and had a great taste garlic, smoke and chilies. It was extremely delicious.

On a return visit, with another couple we had several more great dishes. The only 'miss' was a whole fish with pineapple sauce. The presentation was gorgeous, but there was an unfamiliar spice or spice combination giving the fish a different but not wholly pleasant taste.

This place appears extremely authentic and is worth seeking out. It may be difficult to communicate with the wait staff, as they do not all speak english, although they are extremely helpful."}
{"text":"\"A-OK\"
This restaurant is \"A-OK\"
But I don't like the seating spots.
Otherwise, 5/5"}
{"text":"We go here all the time for dim sum.  It's a good deal, $2.05 for Small, medium, and large Dim Sum items.  We usually load up on the Shimp dumplings.
After going there for at least a dozen times (we go once every 2 weeks or so), we're noticing the service really drops off sharply when they are busy.
We went last week, and it was the worst it has even been...they forgot our tea at first, then they forgot a couple of dishes.  Aafter waiting for 15 minutes after we finished everything else, we told them we wanted the bill and to cancel those items because they never arrived.  It must have been a communication issue, because when we told them, they sent a manager to check out our table to make sure we were't lying or something, then instead of cancelling it, they brought it out before we could pay our bill....hence we now had 2 more dishes when we were all done.  We ended up packing it for take-out.  At least they didn't charge us for the take-out containers.

Let's just say....you get what you pay for.  The food was good...but they skimp on the service.  We'll still go of course...for the food, but don't expect any decent level of service when it's busy."}
{"text":"Huge portions, they offer a large variety of items. This chain used to be one of the first  Szechuan restaurant around.  

What I like about this place:
Their spicy dishes are really good: chili chicken, kung-pao chicken
Services are usually friendly, at least ladies out in the dining room are mostly hardworking

What I dislike about this place:
Dingy...
Found hair in one of the dishes, when we notified them about it...the server, I would think she's a manager, went in with the bowl and came out, telling us it was only an eyebrow (...if it wasn't gross enough?)
A veggie dish--snow pea sprout...were all intact....I can't imagine whether they've washed it


This used to be one of my favourite restaurants, Sadly, I doubt that I'd go back again after this..."}
{"text":"ate here a couple of times for dim sum and its pretty good but ohhhhhhhhh boy we came here for diner and wanted to try something different....we ordered 4 dishes that showed 3 spices in the menu and my god it was not a good nite....if you can handle really spicy food with the dishes feeled with spicy hot peppers then give it a shot, but if not then dont bother ordering or else you will have major stomach cramps and diarrhea right after....i had a hard time clubbing after having this meal"}
{"text":"Went here w/ my relatives (16 ppl in total) on the weekend. We had a private room at the back & I believe the bill was just under $300. Not too bad! 

It's a Northern Chinese restaurant. I'm sure it is prob. better with the dim sum during the day. But for dinner the dishes were just average. Or maybe cuz I had really good Chinese food the night before ;)

I thought the lobster was a bit bland. The soup was great though. I should really remember what the dishes are called so I can yelp properly! Red bean soup dessert had a slight herbal taste to it. It wasn't really my cup of tea. But I liked how they put in tapioca.

Service was ok. We didn't have to wait long for our food even though it was hella busy."}
{"text":"Dropped by here on a weekday for lunch! Yes, Chili Secrets  is a Northern Chinese restaurant however it becomes a dim sum restaurant during the day! This is what I call being flexible! :)

However, you can still order the Northern dim sums with the Cantonese dim sums! Yes this make everyone happy!

We arrived just before 12:00 and the restaurant is half emptied! We got seated promptly! Even the waitstaffs now understand Cantonese! So no need for me to practice my Mandarian..(the only time I am desperate enough to use my Mandarian is when I have to order food!)

The selections here is massive! There are 2 pages for you to pick from. They are all made to order so you can guarantee that they are hot and fresh not being pushed around for ages.

Always fun when there is a group of people to have dim sum so we can all share! We ended up ordering a combination of Cantonese and Northern dim sums. They all tasted pretty good.. And even with 2 of our vegetarian friends, we ended up have enough choices so everyone are happy!

We ended up paying $8 per person includes taxes and tips! And we are all happy and full!

The services is just ok.. but norm for Chinese restaurants!"}
