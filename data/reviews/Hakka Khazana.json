{"text":"This place was really good. The food was excellent and they controlled the spices to make it kid friendly. Service was also very good - great value for money. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great ambience with great service   Smiling staff  Chicken Manchurian and the hot n sour soup was great but Momos and alloo parantha not so much   Washroom can definitely use some housekeeping"}
{"text":"Not that great, had heard a lot from my friends for this place but dint found too great. Had ordered Hout and sour soups, tandoori mushroom and Veg Momos. Soup was below average, mushroom good, and veg momos average."}
{"text":"I ordered through skip the dishes and waited for over 2 hours for my order. The restaurant didn't even call to apologize for the delay. I was given and estimate of 30 mins. I did confirm that the delay was on the part of the restaurant. Rest assured that if you can't deliver orders on time I won't be ordering from them Again."}
{"text":"Cute spot for casual Hakka family dining!   We had the veggie spring rolls, Manchurian Vegetable Pakora in gravy, Szechuan Vegetable Noodles and masala chai (tea).   The spring rolls were the usual frozen and flavourless kind, served with packet plum sauce. Sad because I'm always on the lookout for a good spring roll! I will skip them next time. The Manchurian pakora dish was solid. The gravy was tangier than I was expecting, came with a plentiful amount of pakoras, and was very much enjoyed that evening and the next day as leftovers. The noodle dish was delicious. I also happen to be a noodle addict so when I find a good one, I'm gleeful! The dish is red but it's all colour, it's not spicy hot. The flavour is primarily a pronounced soy sauce one and it's very tasty. The noodles were cooked to the perfect chewy texture. I usually am a stickler for crispy noodles but I was very pleased with the texture and was very happy we ordered it. I only wished there were more veggies. The dish was 95% noodles.   Overall, the food was good and not that spicy. Note that the dishes were cooked to what HK called \"medium\" spicy. Maybe we'll try \"hot\" next time!  Portions were huge! We will be back to taste their Nepalese and Indian menus."}
{"text":"Love the chicken thupka, just wish they pack the same amount in takeout orders as well. Their chicken momos are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Nice staff delicious Food i would totally recommend it. We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Came here on a girl's night out with my sister, and we adored the place!! I was feeling a little under the weather, so chose not to order anything too strong in flavour (curries, spicy soups, etc.). I therefore chose the steamed chicken momos, while my sister ordered the goat curry with a side of steamed basmati rice.  I loved my momos! The inside meat was seasoned perfectly, with a slight but not overwhelming touch of curry flavour. The garlic sauce was absolutely delicious and fragrant.   My sister's goat curry was also very good! It was unlike the curry we're typically used to in that it had a more sour taste with yogurt. There were generous chunks of goat, and so much food in general that we ended up taking it home.  Will come again! Very rarely can we find authentic Nepalese food in the Mississauga region."}
{"text":"My favourite hakka place in the GTA. We live downtown but look forward to driving down to eat here every few months."}
{"text":"Probably our favourite restaurant in the neighbourhood. The food is spicy and they make it more spicy if you desire . Veg Manchuria is better than chicken Manchuria. Chicken is overcooked and becomes hard. Big portion . Easily 2 portion can be shared between 3 people."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the hot and sour veg soup, chicken lollipop, chicken momos, chicken tikka roll, gobi manchurian and veg sch noodles. The server was very hospitable. It's a clean and simple restaurant. The price is right and caters to Nepali , Indian and Hakka food. The spice level was perfect....lip smaking good!!! Love it when restaurants keep to the perfect spice levels. Will be our family favourite spot for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Slow service but amazing food. I always order ahead of time. Their a little under staffed sometimes. But always polite and yeah this is my go to for Indian food. Its so authentic, and I can't go anywhere else. In love with their butter chicken garlic naan and the spicy sezchuan chicken noodle. Butter chicken has kick which I love and it's not overly watery."}
{"text":"Slow service of food and food quality is average , Nepali dimsums are good . Good for quick snack n not for connoisseurs!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a decent Hakka restaurant in Brampton which I'm sure isn't too hard to find , i looked upon my fellow tellers to guide me ... so I was told to check out this place Hakka Khazana . So I tried it , and it's very hard for me try new Hakka places considering I have my favourite spot in Mississauaga and as most of you know when you find a place you LoVe it's hard to compare any other place .... So I came here .....in fact I have eaten here twice now within 2 weeks . I have had the curry goat and chilli chicken and bOth we're very tasty and well made . I also had the chilli momo and they are a little salty but very tasty !  Service is decent and they will answer your questions about stuff you don't know as I had to ask a few questions . Prices are average maybe a little higher then other Hakka places but it is what it is and they do have a full bar for drinks .  If your in the area they are worth a try for sure ."}
{"text":"We thought of trying this as the menu seem to be interesting with fusion of Indian, Chinese and Nepalese. However, the we found the food to be very greasy and stale could not finish even half and decided not take. There are much better Hakka options in Brampton, the owner should visit other places and introspect on how food quality can be improved."}
{"text":"This place is right across from my house, so strangely, we don't normally buy food from here.  It has also changed management (?) and restaurant names 3x in the last 2 years (from Moti Mahal, to Soaltee, to current one), so that made us a bit apprehensive about ordering from here.  On Tues this week though, feeling a bit lazy to cook, we ordered from this place.  Hubby had a small tiff with the owners because their business promo on offer wasn't very clear:  the billboard outside said free dish if you order 2 dishes worth $30, the promo inside says free dish for 2 dishes worth $20, but the servers inside claims its actually free dish for 2 dish orders of $25.  The prices on the menu also doesn't tally with whatever their cash register price is, and when hubby pointed this out, the owner at the till just smiled and said 'thank you very much' but didn't clarify nor apologize nor give us any concession for the error.  Clearly, their business sense sucked, and we nearly wrote this place off as one of those places we shd never venture into again without risk of starvation. HOWEVER..when we came home and sampled our order...we had a change of mind.  The food was awesome.  We ordered chicken fried rice and the morsels of chicken were impressive, the rice not too oily, the ingredients, visible, and the overall seasoning was great.  We also ordered a fish curry and butter chicken, and both got wiped clean fast.  I guess we will just have to bear with the business' business-sense in order to avail of this tasty food."}
{"text":"Great little Hakka restaurant near the Brampton/Mississauga border. The staff were very friendly and the food was delicious. I wish there was a bit more selection on the menu though. I really liked the decor and the Nepalese paintings with information on the country so you can learn while you eat. I'll be back to feed my Hakka cravings!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, Great servers, Nice family place, been there with my family ... Great food .... They also have LLBO .... its good for all ages ... Went there few times ... Did take out for sometimes .... All awesome"}
{"text":"Overall, they were pretty good. I would recommend the fish, it was excellent! The service was quick. They checked on us a couple of times while we were dinning."}
{"text":"WoW... They make the BEST (Dry) Chili Fish, it's so good, I am currently still eating right now but they deserve a review, so here it is! I also got the Vegetable Manchurian Noodles and it is good but nothing to brag about. Anytime I am in the area, I will definitely get the Chili Fish again... The best Chili Fish I got was from a Hakka Chinese Restaurant in Scarborough, Ontario... but this one either comes in First or Second place to that one. I was craving so badly for Chili Fish and my cravings are Satisfied. YUM! I got takeout, so the customer service was decent. I asked for recommendations and got them. They didn't put a Fork or Napkin in my bag, they should have done that but who cares, they cook Good Fish, so they can get away with it,  hehe *Smiley Face*"}
{"text":"Ordered from Hakka Khazana through Uber Eats last night and i have to say that I was impressed! We ordered 2 veggie Simosas, Szechuan Vegetable Noodles, and Chicken Lillipop(s).  The Veggie Simosas were small but very good! The filing was tasty and they were nice and crunchy- you can tell they fried them to order.  The Szechuan Vegetable noodles were GREAT. Im a noodle addict and these noodles were seriously very delicious. A very generous portion too with lots of fresh crunch veggies- Would definitely order again.  The chicken lollipops had a great taste however they were very small! The order came with 8 which seems like a lot but there is only a very small bite of chicken on each one. Would be nice to see some larger pieces of chicken for $9.  Overall: Portions 4/5 Taste 5/5 Value 4/5   Would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place today as yelp was showing me this is the nearest Hakka place.  Got the chicken corn soup and chicken Manchuria Noodles for take out. I place an order over the phone and when I went in 15 mins later my food was ready to be picked up.  The soup did not have much chicken, broth flavour or salt in it. Hence I added some hot sauce, pepper and salt to it. As far as the noodles were concerned they were pretty average as well. I asked the guy over the phone to make them mild instead of spicy which the menu stated. Even though they were mild they did not have any flavouring to it. The portion size on the other hand was ginormous. It could literally feed 4 people.  Living in Mississauga and having been to much better Hakka places I unfortunately will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Sweet corn chicken soup was great however the mixed Hakka Noodles were mediocre. A little low on portion sizes.  The staff was friendly.  There washroom was dreadful."}
{"text":"Nice service, casual vibe. Taste needs some improvement  atleast for the dish we ate. It was chilly chicken but no chilli! Singapore noodles was decent, light and zesty.  I still prefer Bombay chopsticks over this any day!"}
{"text":"A good choice for Hakka food in Mississauga. The flavours are there, price is very reasonable, and portion sizes are extremely generous.I've also had their food catered. I'd recommend checking this place out."}
