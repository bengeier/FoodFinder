{"text":"Been here quite a few times. Have had a bit of stuff on their menu, but the best is the ginseng chicken soup. Their other soups are a little bit more expensive than other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. Moved to the neighborhood earlier this year and wanted to check out this place because of all the positive reviews and it's the only Korean place close to me outside of the North York Yonge St. area.  I've only had the Gingseng Chicken soup. The chicken is organic, stuffed with sticky rice on the inside and comes with a small side of rice noodles which you can place in the soup. It is delicious and has a subtle gingseng taste.  My spouse has had the bibimbap and tofu soup, both of which were great.   The menu is small. I wish they offered pork bone soup and kalbi beef. The prices are slightly higher than other Korean restaurants. Service is always friendly.  I've been to this place about four times now and will definitely be a regular. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall on the east side of Leslie, north of Finch Ave. Been there 5 times now, and Koryo Samgaetang has been consistently good, and consistency is the sign of a great restaurant. It not only has amazing gingseng (or what Korean's call Insam) chicken soup, but also has great cow gut soup and others.    Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Have hot stone beef. Place is closy and great. This is the place for simple authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"The people here are always so friendly and attentive! The food is delicious and it's so conveniently located too :)  Whenever we ask for seconds on the appetizers they're happy to provide :) great customer service."}
{"text":"Ginseng Chicken Soup FTW!!  Best place to go on on a cold night. it's a small placed so it can get crowded during peak hours. They serve a variety of Korean dishes you would find in other Korean restaurants but I highly recommend the Ginseng Chicken soup. There are actually several variety of Ginseng soup but I also go for the Ginseng Chicken. Inside the chicken is stuffed with sticky rice and a date. I really like the simple flavours in this soup but you can always adjust the flavour from the salt and pepper provided.  Tip: Open 365 days a year"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, but recently their service has deteriorated from good to terrible. Even though the restaurant was only half-full, the waitress did not refill our teapot or take away empty dishes. We could see them standing there chatting, but each time, we had to signal them to refill our teapot or clear dishes.  One particular waitress was especially unfriendly. She did not seem happy to work there. She did not like that we were not ready to order 5 minutes after sitting down. The owner seemed nice, but unfortunately she does not speak English, and was not able to service the guests. Their prices has increased over the years, and the quality and portion of the food has gone down. Overall I'm quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Actually quite liked the food.  Ordered the Raw Veal Bibimbap, as well as the Gom Tang, the ginseng chicken soup, and the seafood/green onion pancake.  Everything including the 6 side dishes were well made and pretty tasty.  I also liked how some of the side dishes were a little different from other places (such as the salad with black sesame dressing) and the dried fish one, whereas they still had staples such as the radish and cucumber kimchis.  Definitely will come back if I'm in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Came to this Korean restaurant for a lunch with my friend after reviewing the Yelp review last month. This was a very nice Korean place with authentic food that I was looking for. Although it's a small restaurant with not too many tables, I still like its environment and ambiance, simple and comfortable.    Since this's my first time here, I apparently took a few minutes checking out the food menu. I finally ordered traditional Korean ginseng chicken soup and my friend ordered hot stone bibimbap. My food came out a delicious dish with a hot, steaming, a small chicken stuffed with rice, ginseng, garlic, and  jujube. The other dish Bibimbap was presented so colorful mixed rice with meat and assorted vegetables. We both liked our food and would come back to try out other dishes..."}
{"text":"Came here again five weeks after their grand opening (first time I came they had only been open \"fifteen days\" according to the cute host) and there's the same quality food being served, absolutely fantastic service and no compromises in quality, taste, consistency. I really like that this restaurant has gotten so much more popular in the last sixish weeks its been open! And I am happy and appreciative to note they've taken comments on their potion sizes to heart-- they won't be running out of their namesake dish in the future (happened to the couple beside me the first time I came to try this place!! Yikes, we got their earlier and (luckily) got the last two bowls :-D) heh. Btw they ended up getting their dakbokkeumtang which looked HUGE and smelled spicy and unreal and was sizzling tantalizingly close to me... I vow to try it my next time there. Their waitstaff are super nice and very friendly. They allow some weird substitutions too, I went with a friend who wanted her bibimbap minus the \"bap\" lol.. I laughed but our server was totally cool with it although she did kinda give my friend a funky look haha. Best korean ginseng soup I have tried... That's some magic broth. Others I've tried so far in toronto are ultra bland compared to this one-- it's got a deep, rich, soul satisfying flavor that makes you want to drink it all! Their banchans have nice variety too and are unlimited, although I don't care for their white kimchi, too sweet, not spicy-- but others are delicious (about 7 total including sigeumchi namul, sukjunamul, kkaduki, oisobagi (MMM), japchae, and pickled sweet korean pear."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. They have a unique selection of Korean food which makes this a place we will go to again.  I had the hot stone raw bibimbap. My only regret was that I didn't ask for it to be less spicy. Otherwise the veal was very tender.   You could tell that they took extra care in preparing their soups.   There was quite a variety of banchans which was great. I enjoyed the salad with the sesame dressing."}
{"text":"Service - 2 stars We had a party of 4 adults and 4 children (2 babies and 2 toddlers). They demanded that we order at least 8 dishes since we are occupying 8 seats. I thought that was rude. We ordered 6 instead. Children can't finish a meal on their own. Restaurant did not offer children size dishes. After placing the orders, the service was ok.  Place - 2.5 stars Plenty of parking as its located in a plaza. Very small restaurant...not for groups of 5 or more. Ok for cleaniless.  Food - 2.5 stars Portions are small. Taste and presentation is average.   Would I go back?  Probably not."}
{"text":"Located in a quiet suburban plaza. this restaurant is a cozy find. The walls are decorated with posters of drawings of the ingredients of samgyetang, and other menu items.   We ordered Koryo samgyetang ($15.99). The chicken was tender, with rice in the middle. The soup was flavorful, not too salty, and is exactly something you want on a cool day, or if you are sick. On top of that, the soup was served with a small side of white noodles, which I wish had a bit more of. That, or a side of white rice. The dish was big enough to serve two, as there was quite a bit of chicken.   We also ordered dolsot bibimbap, which was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. It did consists of a lot of vegetables, colourful, and hearty. It was on the pricier side for a dolsot bibimbap ($12.99).   I would definitely go back for the samgyetang, not so much for the dolsot bibimbap. I must say though, it is quite comparable to some of the best places in Korean town!"}
{"text":"The opportunity presented itself and I absolutely had to try the samgeytang (ginseng chicken soup)!  Restaurant size: Comfortable! Along one side of the restaurant are several booths which can seat around 4 each. On the other side is one long wooden-wall bench and separate tables.   Portion size: Great assortment of banchan (appetizers) in the form of... kimchi, seaweed, spiced cucumber, sliced potato (?) and lettuce w/ black sesame dressing (?). The actual mains (samgeytang for me and hot soup tofu for my friend) were very adequate in filling and warming us up.  Food quality: Very good in my perspective! The samgeytang wasn't salty (there is salt available for you to add), and I was able to enjoy the delicious ginseng taste. The chicken was ultra tender and was falling off the bones, making it a pretty easy meal.  Service: Friendly staff, coming at the exact perfect times. One of the servers came by to check if we wanted a refill of banchan (YES PLEASE!). Since I ordered a dish with lots of bones, a mini waste basket was provided to use.   Final thoughts: Making the left turn back onto Leslie will be a struggle, but before that time enjoy some delicious samgeytang and other Korean dishes! I'd definitely come back again to try dishes recommended by others! Hrmm...maybe it'll be my new Monday place?"}
{"text":"I had the chicken soup, which had very light flavour of ginseng. I really like the idea of the rice inside the chicken, very flavourful and moist."}
{"text":"a nice addition to the area, very fresh ingredients, ginseng soup is good but not overwhelming in ginseng.  Bibimbap was well done, stone bowl hot enough to make the rice crunchy, veal was just ok.  Prices are a bit higher than the korean places on yonge st.  Hope they expand their menu later."}
{"text":"Not much from the outside, but was pleasantly surprised when we walked in..  Nice and clean environment, very friendly staff and attentive.. never kept us waiting, sat us right away. Was helpful with the menu explaining dishes etc. I got a vegetable dish (b2) and we also got H3 which was spicier than thought it would be.. I added an egg on top and we were served straight away, food was delicious and bathrooms were clean! Always a plus people  Noise level is upbeat and loud but music is fitting for environment, it's not to the extent that it bothers you.  Debit accepted Plenty of Parking outside"}
{"text":"Decided to try out this place after reading the reviews on Yelp - I would never have found it otherwise, since it's located in a plaza that's basically in the middle of nowhere. The interior of the restaurant is quite nice though, and because it's fairly small it never got extremely loud even during busy hours.   I ordered the raw veal bibimbap, a dish I've never seen in other Korean restaurants. It was quite good! I really enjoyed the texture of the meat, and it mixed extremely well with the vegetables and spicy sauce that came with it. The banchans were praiseworthy too - there was a wide range of flavours, from the spicy kimchi to the salty seaweed to the sweet potatoes. We asked for refills of all the dishes and got them with no complaints :)  However, given the relatively high price point of this place, I expected slightly better service than what we received. Of course, no one came to check on us during our meal, but it shouldn't have taken 10 minutes to get the attention of the waitress. Why didn't I take off a star for that? Because we were there for over 2 hours and they never bothered us either, so I guess I don't deserve to complain haha.  All in all, a great restaurant to eat at with friends or even alone for the food! I will be back to try their legendary samgyetang :)"}
{"text":"Decided to try it here with the family based on reviews. Had the stone bowl rice with meat and veggies,  dokk mandu guk, bulgogi with rice and their specialty koryo samgaetang.  The koryo samgaetang didn't taste anything like what I grew up  with.  It tasted like they took some real broth and mixed it with store bought chicken stock.  Overall, wouldn't return. Portions are half size compared to the typical restaurant and lots of MSG.  We  left hungry and thirsty all night."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. Will definitely return - my new fave Korean restaurant.   The ginseng chicken is their signature dish - you should definitely try. We tried the grilled short rib patty and veal bimbimbap - loved both dishes as well.   Very flavorful dishes and all of them come out steaming hot as Asian food should!"}
{"text":"Small but mighty restaurant with good food, fast service, tasteful decor and beautiful place setting. Besides serving up a more generous than usual spread of banchan, Koryo also goes beyond the usual fare of kimchi, ie. when I checked in, there was an intriguing salad of lettuce flavoured with a creamy housemade black sesame dressing. For mains, as a ovo-lacto vegetarian, I found my options in their bibimbap selection, all of which you can ask to be made meatless. I ended up settling on the  organic mushroom one and as advertised, it had a healthy variety of fungi, plus a dainty lotus root crisp. Overall a lovely dining experience and I'll be sure to check in again."}
{"text":"I had the Ginseng Samgyetang, and it was so fresh and clean. This place is definitely one of the nicer korean restaurants that I've been to. We also had the green onion and seafood pancake, where I actually saw a whole shrimp within the pancake.   I definitely think 2 people can share the ginseng samgyetang, especially since they gave you a whole chicken and stuff it with rice. It also comes with a side portion of noodles.   The restaurant itself is very clean, service is fast and attentive. It has the small family restaurant feel, but also very robust. I like the side dishes, and the server actually came over and asked if we wanted more (twice) when he saw that we were finished. Service is A+.   Recommend to anyone looking for a nicer, more fresh, Korean restaurant. I'll be back here again to try different dishes!"}
{"text":"I visited with my family. The samgyetang (Soup with ginseng and a whole chicken) tasted amazing. The meat was tender, and seasoned just right. The servers were responsive and friendly. I would love to come back."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Thursday for lunch. Pretty empty. Service was prompt and they were really nice.   I got the bibimbap and my friend got the ginseng chicken soup. My portion seemed pretty small for $11 but it tasted good.  My friend's soup was really good, flavourful and the chicken was so tender.   I think there are better deals for Korean food in North York but this is good if you're can't commute far."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch cause we were in the area. It doesn't stand out much since it's a shopping plaza but it was a good find.  I ordered some kind of intestine soup which was awesome. They had things that looked really good on the menu.  As with all Korean restaurants we got the normal selection of side dishes.  One thing that make it stand from other Korean restaurants is that the interior looks really neat. The place is clean and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The place wasn't bad I did find the Korean food more bland than other places I go too.their ambient is casual and it looks clean.  I got the bibimbap, it was decent but I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"Went here with friends on a Tuesday evening and we had the place to ourselves. Maybe because the place was just a little bit off the common area. Restaurant was quaint, clean, and quiet (again, we were the only customers). The food was good and our waitress was pleasant. We had the bulgogi hot stone and the beef soup which tasted really bland, but I guess that was how it was supposed to be."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this authentic korean meal! Ginseng Chicken was very good. Place is small and could be hard to find parking or a seat during busy hours."}
{"text":"Delicious Korean food tucked away in a strip plaza that can be easily missed. We ordered a variety of plates to share (including their ginseng chicken) light in flavour but were all delightful nonetheless. Service is good but the restaurant is a little small so be sure to make the appropriate arrangements if you're coming with a large party."}
{"text":"Food Quality - Good, fresher than usual, good appetizers.  Menu Design - Good - different from other Korean places. Streamlined menu Service - Fine, mostly good but one strong exception.  Decor - Above average Location - Uptown, what can you expect Price - Fair  Quantity of meat left some to be desired."}
{"text":"I actually adore their koryo samgyetang here (ginseng chicken soup). It is literally one of the healthiest dishes that you can order and it tastes SO good. I didn't need to add salt, the chicken was so tender and juicy and the dish is beyond filling. I would say...don't order it if you dont' like ginseng - BUT i would also say that I am NOT a big fan of ginseng and i actually loved this dish and would come back and get it when I'm craving something hearty and filling and healthy.   The koryo samgytang was $16.99 - so definitely a pricier Korean dish. My friend got the beef noodle soup - $10.99. I would say that this is not your typical Korean restaurant - it doesn't have that wide variety of regular dishes that a lot of other restaurants have, rather, they specialize in a few dishes that are quite good."}
{"text":"Service and ambiance is decent, and they do have a variety of items on their menu.  However I find the food to be just average. Nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's birthday and it was a pretty neat discovery since I didn't know that there were Korean restaurants in the area! As the restaurant's name already indicates, the restaurant specializes in chicken soup and bibimbap, so I probably wouldn't stray away from that when ordering here.  Banchan wise, they were quite generous! I believe we had a good 5-6 dishes. My favourite banchans here were the japchae, and the honey potatoes! The salad is pretty good too, has a black sesame dressing, which I presume was bought from a grocery store. Service was great too! The waitress was always quick to check up on us and let us know that the banchans were refillable.  I got the raw veal dolsot bibimbap and I thought it was fantastic! It also comes with a soup (more like a broth) which I found came in quite handy to cut the spiciness from the veal! Portion was also just right. Just enough to be satisfied, not too much to be uncomfortable. However it is important to keep in mind that most menu items are quite mildly flavoured. So don't expect to get something really hearty and flavourful! Both korean ginseng soup and bibimbap are relatively lighter and more delicate tasting items in my opinion.  Overall fantastic place! Great to go to if you're in the area and want to try something different."}
{"text":"so I came here about 3 times already.  The first time I came for the ginseng chicken soup. It was delicious, except there was no STICKY RICE. I asked the waitresses about it and they were nice to give me a bowl of rice as replacement.  The second time I came here I ordered hae jae tang. Personally I wasn't a fan. The spiciness took over the soup taste.  There wasn't much flavor to it. The pigs blood was over cooked.  And the third time I came was a few days ago.  I walked in. I was brought to a seat. I sat down for 15-20 minutes. No tea.  no service.   I think they didn't notice us since we were in the corner. Finally,  they placed our order.  It wasn't long after the food came and ONCE AGAIN NO STICKY RICE in my ginseng chicken soup.. Why oh why..  Must it be the 2 times I order the soup there is no STICKY RICE...   Honestly I am so disappointed, I was really excited to try the sticky rice.   Anyway, I was hoping that it was just a once a while STICKY RICE slip out from the chicken. But I'm assuming this happens pretty frequently.   Hopefully the next time I come , it won't happen AGAIN. Since  paying $20 for a chicken soup."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch with a friend who recommended this place. She mentioned the bibimbap was good so I gave it a try. I ordered the only vegetables bibimbap and to be honest, there wasn't much flavour so I had to ask for soy sauce. Perhaps this is not the case for the other bibimbap options which have meat in it? Anyways, aside from the taste, the portion was quite big and presentation was on point. I was very happy with the side dishes as they had the very yummy potatoes (please don't get rid of it). The lettuce with the black sesame dressing was interesting - quite tasty in fact. Service was good, restaurant was clean and they had good Korean music playing. I would definitely come back to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Despite the strange shop name, it serve more than just Ginseng Chicken and Bibimbap. There isn't much selection (my dad was like \"where's the pork bone soup?\"), but what they do serve is fantastic. Their bibimbaps are out of this world - piping hot and so flavourful. I also really like the beef soup meal. The soup stock is light and unsalted - you can salt it yourself. Plus, the side dishes! So many, so plentiful, so yummy!  And while I haven't yet had the Ginseng Chicken, it's the go-to dish for my friend who swears it's amazing. A small little shop, so come early because there seems to be a line up here during the lunch hour rush."}
{"text":"Awesome Korean food spot! If you're a monster like me and love young 30 day old tender chicken cooked in delicious ginseng broth, this is the place to be. Everything else is optional. But if you're like me (curious and gluttonous), then try mung bean pancake. Pretty delicious, just know it's about $12 for two smallish pancake.  Let's face it, the only way to battle the cold, Korean style, is to get chicken in ginseng soup."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4* or even 4 1/2* for their Sangaetang but everything else in their menu is average at best. I have had their Bibimbap, Katsudon, Tonkatsu and Dupbap and none of their dishes were great as the Boiled Chicken in Ginseng soup.   My wife had a nasty cold and she was craving sangaetang. That's her comfort food when she's sick so we came here to make her feel better. However, both my daughter and myself are not big fan of the dish and decided instead to order the Korean Rib patty. The dish comes with fried egg, rice, rice cakes and green onions. For $15, the dish was lacking. The beef patty tasted okay but the rice cake was not good at all.  #15 of 2018"}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times and I noticed recently they made some changes to their menu. Things like how good the ginseng they used in the soup, now they no longer say anything about it.  They added a few different soups that are not chicken but beef, and not just any beef, it's beef intestines and/or blood pudding.   My latest visit was on a weekend. They were really busy. They don't even have time to clean up tables after customers left for as long as 10 minutes.  Food-wise, the ginseng chicken soup had a stronger ginseng taste to it on a weekday than the weekends. But it still a much better one than other places. The beef intestines spicy soup was pretty good, nice flavors and ingredient, it even have some glass noodle too. Bibimbap had a lot of different vegetables, even had acorn jelly in it too. And it comes with a small bowl of chicken soup.  As other have mention, the black sesame seeds salad dressing is really good, it tasted like melted black sesame seeds ice cream."}
{"text":"Cutest little Korean restaurant with great food! Portions are a good size, a nice variety in the menu, and excellent side dishes!   Came in super late, near closing on a Sunday night and got seated right before their last call! Make sure you're there 30 min before close for any food! Service was excellent, very attentive and friendly servers!  I got the Hot Pot Japchae Dupbap and Mung Bean Pancakes, which were both very good! With both rice and japchae in the hot stone pot, the food stayed nice and hot while offering a good amount of food to fill you up. Beef was also very sweet, and excellent bowl overall. The Mung Bean Pancakes were great as well. A nice blended flavour throughout with a wonderful sauce!  The side dishes were awesome though! Love it when they give you just a dish of the kimchi radishes! The salad with black sesame dressing was also really cool!  Overall a nice discovery late at night! Will definitely be back for the Ginseng Chicken Soup that everyone raves about next time!"}
{"text":"Mushroom rice was a miss (far too dry and lacking in any discernable flavour) but the service, small dishes, and other rice and noodle dishes were pretty good. Would visit again to have the ginseng chicken."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for healing food. I come here for the chicken soup when I get sick or feel under the weather. They use a lot of different healing promoting herbs in the soup. The glutinous rice helps with digestion. The chicken is from a local source and is really really tender and easy to digest. I always feel like I gain energy from their soup after eating it!   Also, the service is really really fast and efficient. The soup comes out so fast, it makes you feel really thankful that there's so little wait time."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for awhile and finally decided to come when I was coming down with a cold. The samgaetang here is delicious and totally helped clear my cold within days. The soup comes out piping hot and the chicken is tender and soft. I loved it! It obviously doesn't compare to what I've tried in Korea and home cooked samgaetang, but this is the next best thing. I will definitely be coming here whenever I'm craving this soup."}
{"text":"As per the name of this place, we ordered the gingsen chicken soup and veal bibimbap. The price range for the chicken soup ($16) and bibimbap ($13) was a bit higher than your typical korean joint, so we were expecting some above average quality. And this place fid not fail to disappoint. Their side dishes were good, and included seaweed, kimchi, turnip, lettuce salad witg sesame dressing, etc. The chicken soup had about half a chicken and the broth was really clean and light in flavouring. The chicken itself was stuffed with rice, dates, and ginseng. The bibimbap had raw veal and mushrooms with all the other typically bibimbap ingredients. Overall, this is a great experience if you want some quality korean food!"}
{"text":"The outside of the restaurant looks really sketchy but inside is very nicely renovated. The waiters and waitresses were very nice. However they messed up my order and gave me the wrong soup. I asked them if it was a mistake because i ordered kimchi pork soup but they gave me seafood soup. And they immediately took it back and changed it for me. And the waitress who took our order came over to personally apologize to us for mixing up the order, which was very nice of them. The food itself was disappointing. The portions were beyond small, we literally scraped the entire bowl for every speck of rice. The side dishes were tasty but they didn't have kimchi o.O which was so weird.  Overall i would never come back here again and i don't recommend anyone coming here unless you want to try the ginseng chicken soup (thats they're specialty)"}
{"text":"It was the first time I tried Korean ginseng chicken soup in Toronto. I'm very happy to choose Koryo cuz I have a very tasty bowl of soup here!  Since it is the first time I visited Koryo, I choose the classic Korean style Ginseng chicken soup (S1). I found that there is also Green tea chicken soup and Perilla seed, sounds very interesting huh? Maybe I will try them next time.  The S1 is great. The whole chicken is very tender. You can have a taste of the chicken itself. The stuffing inside is quite rich in variety, including sticky rice, date, chestnut, and ginseng. And each soup comes with a small bowl of rice noodles. I had finished the chicken first, leaving the rice noodles and sticky rice in the soup. Trust me it is a very good idea to have the rice and noodles at last. They were both deeply soaked with the ginseng soup flavor in the end.  The restaurant itself is open 365 days a year."}
{"text":"Clean is the word when it came to my mind Korean Cuisine.   True friendly service Not recommend for big group.  3 to 6 are ok to spend here.  It is not outstanding Korean food.  If you wanna try a new and clean Korean restaurant esp soup items.  This restaurant worths your time and money"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in North York! Thanks to my trusty food Pokedex a.k.a. Yelp App I found this place to satisfy my craving of bibimbap and some tasty Korean side dishes.  It is hard to find and pretty dark inside but the service is great and the food is spectacular. All of the main dishes come in a hot stone bowl and the rice is super crispy in my bibimbap! We asked for more Korean appetizers and they brought them out with no fuss and muss.  A lady beside us ordered a dish and she was not satisfied with it and they simply apologized and gave her a new dish with no arguments or weird looks or anything.  Service is great and food even better! Come here if you need your Korean food fix!"}
{"text":"Cute Korean place. Good fast service and tasty food. Wife is happy they give egg with her tofu soup."}
{"text":"Love the bibimbap! They have lunch special too for 7.99. They have take out menu. The service is good, the staff were very nice. It was quite busy when we came in. My boyfriend had the mushroom bibimbap and i had the spicy tofu soup and it was served with rice. It was amazingg!"}
{"text":"More pricey/upscale in price point and ambience than your typical Korean joint, but the flavours are so potent and authentic! The servers are so kind. ^^   We ordered the ginseng chicken soup, the spicy pork hot stone bowl and the beef bulgolgi hot stone bowl which came with soup and rice. All were great! Bit bummed they didn't have gamjatang on the menu but it was nice to try something new. :) As for the interior of the place, it is clean, crisp and classy. It is on the small and narrow side, so its best for 1 on 1 or small group meals."}
{"text":"It was a random Sunday evening and my bf and I were craving some bimbimbap. Lo and behold, I decided to check the Yelp app and this was the first resto that came up in the area. It was an absolute great find because this wasn't your ordinary Korean restaurant but they specialize in a variety of bimbimbap choices. They are also known for the Chicken Ginseng Ginger soup which I must try next time I go. This place is in a random plaza just after Leslie and Finch.. a little hard to find because the signage doesn't really stand out. As we walked in, we smelled the beautiful aroma from the steam of the bimbimbaps that everyone had so we knew this was a must try.   We ordered the traditional bimbimbap and bimbimbap with noodles mixed with rice. Both came out nice and piping hot in a hot stone bowl and was cooked to perfection. They also started us off with a Korean starter soup and appetizers. Loved every single one of them that we asked for another round.   Overall, love the ambience, great service and wonderful tasting food. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Good food... regular spicy level for Korean.  Spicy pork dupbap tasted awesome but for its size it's expensive.   One serving probably can't fulfill an average adult.  Cutlet pork was awesome too.  It's reasonably priced compareing to the dupbap we ordered.  Domestic beer pricer fair, $3.8/bottle not cold enough for an August summer evening when it was 30°C after sunset."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise! This restaurant is located in a strip mall so I was a bit skeptical at first as I arrived at the location, but pleasantly surprised as soon as I stepped in. The decor is adorable, simple and comfortable. We got the spicy chicken for 2 to share and it was pretty good. A bit too spicy for me but my friend loved it and I still enjoyed it. The staff were so cute and friendly too. And we all noticed all the other customers were actually korean. I'm going to come back next time to try the ginseng chicken :)"}
{"text":"They use very fresh ingredients and nothing is overly sweet or salty. You can tell they put a lot of care into the food and presentation. I highly recommend the seafood pancake and the gingseng soup. Bibimbap here is also great. The menu is a bit limited though."}
{"text":"My love for Korean food is only growing! Although, I may not have the best spicy tolerance I'm working on it.  My favourite dish is the Soft-Tofu Stew with Seafood or Beef. This location had just that but with dumplings!!! Who doesn't love dumplings?   As excited as I was to satisfy my Korean cravings, I was slightly disappointed by the flavour of the stew. Don't get me wrong, it was still great and the dumplings were up to par, I personally felt that it lacked seasoning or more flavour - in comparaison to the other Soft tofu with Beef stews.   This cute dainty Korean restaurant is located in a plaza on Leslie, and you might miss it if you don't keep your eye open! The service of our food was fast, however the staff didn't come back to fill our waters or ask if everything was going well (something you usually expect at most restaurants). Although, I would come back and perhaps try a new dish!"}
{"text":"I am no stranger to Korean soups, I practically have kamjatang coursing through my veins, but this place was my first experience with samgeytang (ginseng chicken soup).   After a long day walking around downtown Toronto a friend and I decided to come a little north and try this place out. We ordered their chicken ginseng soup (samgeytang) and a raw veal bibimbap. The samgeytang was awesome, nothing like the pork bone soup I so often gorge on. This soup is not spicy at all, rather a very mild and subtle flavour. Our soup came with a whole tiny chicken which was fall off the bone tender, the broth had some subtle flavours from the ginseng and dates, nothing overwhelming but in a word \"soul-satisfying.\" Prior to eating the soup I was feeling run down and tired but this soup actually gave me a big burst of energy, this would be a great meal for anyone who was feeling a little under the weather.   The bibimbap was quite good as well; it came with an assortment of vegetables, raw veal and a raw egg on top allowing you to cook said egg and veal to your liking in the hot stone pot. The veal was served in a spicy sauce that had a big kick; they did serve hot sauce on the side which I added prior to tasting the dish and realized that it was unnecessary as the dish on its own would probably have been sufficiently spicy. The banchans (side dishes) were some of the best I have ever had; their kimchi is absolutely amazing, so crunchy and fresh. Everything at this restaurant is clearly made in house with lots of care.   The restaurant is pretty small with a modern Korean feel, booths on one side and tables on the other. It is a family run business and the time I went their was only one young girl working the front of house, she was very polite and gracious with no hesitations about bringing us more banchan. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a Korean fix beyond BBQ or pork bone soup."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Korean restaurants we've been to so far! Their side dishes are plentiful and delicious. I find that their food has a little more extra compared to other places. I'll definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Korean restaurant (due to the fact that my best buddies are Korean), I believe it's safe to say this is the best one yet. I always thought there can't be much of a difference between all these Korean restaurants and I still do partially believe this statement stands. What can be so special about vegetables mixed with rice or a chicken broth in Korean style. Eh. But this one proved me wrong. It's the overall atmosphere and the service that makes the food even better. The waitresses were very attentive and polite (even though some of them struggle with English a bit). Also, I feel this Korean restaurant is way cleaner than other ones I've been to. I love how they use metal-wares (like please, I hate those melamine).  P.S. I had the sesame seed chicken ginseng soup, which was on point."}
{"text":"As I am allergic to ginseng I didn't try Koryo's chicken soup but went for the other items on their menu.   Overall staff were friendly. Food came promptly. Restaurant was nice and clean. Food was hot upon arrival.   Food Hot stone bulgogi rice - came with chicken broth soup (flavourful with a herbal taste). The stone pot kept the rice nice and warm while forming sticky rice giving it an extra crunch. The flavours of the bulgogi wasn't too strong nor overly salty/sweet. Could use a little more cause. Beef was tender though.   Seafood pancake - I really enjoyed this. Not too oily with a tiny crunch from the pan fried edges. Good amount of spring onions and enough seafood to satisfy the tastebuds.   Tofu soup with seafood - this dish for me at first didn't taste hot but the chilli flakes start to creep up on you. Can use a little more seafood but the tofu was great  Nonetheless would love to come back and try other dishes"}
{"text":"Simple menu, solid banchan, and fairly priced. Definitely one of the better and cleaner Korean places that I've been to. A lot of people seem to get the ginseng chicken, but I was feeling something heartier and got the hot stone bibimbap. Service was fast. It wasn't the best bibimbap I've ever had, but the banchan selection was lit."}
{"text":"This restaurant has had a lot of great reviews andnim not sure why. Because it has basically failed in the most basic thing which is the food. We had ordered a ginsing chicken which is what their famous for. And a tonkatsu set. First of all we went during a lunch time. In which the restaurant only had around 5 tables including us. So it was not even st half capacity. It took them 25 minutes to get a ginsing chicken out and a record time 35 minutes to make a tonkatsu. Now you would think with the amount of time it took. It would be mind blowing and amazing. Unfortunately not only was it not. The food was below average at best. The ginsing chicken. The chicken was rough and overcooked. The tonkatsu was absolutely terrible. The meat was so thin it was like literally paper thin. And thr batter was poorly placed. Now you would think with such subpar foodm this place would be cheaper. But it wasnt. They charged more for both tonkatsu and ginger chicken then all the other restauarants around the area. Such as yonge and finch. This restaurant is an avoid at all cost. It has bad food. Bad pricing. And long wait times."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far! Had the soup with intestines the first time, amazing and very flavourful. The second time I went with the raw veal bibimbap. Best bibimbap ever! I had the lemon soy sauce to go with it which was very refreshing. Owner and employees are very friendly. Prices are on the higher end compared to some other korean restaurants but well worth the price for sure!  Strongly recommended"}
{"text":"Before I comment on the delicious food at Koryo, I just want to say I love their staff! There is this one cute waitress that is always so smiley and friendly when she serves you, it's really heart warming :). On top of that, Koryo has some of the best Dolsot bibimbap in the GTA. I can make this claim because trust me, I've tried most of them lol. Being vegan, I have to exclude the beef and egg from my bibimbap, so the variety, freshness, and flavour of the veggies is what I look for. The veggies are perfectly sautéed and very vibrant, which makes for a beautiful bibimbap. The hot stone bowl is also SUPER hot (Some places serve dolsot bibimbap in warm bowls, ugh), which creates awesome nurungji (hard rice at bottom of bowl) and keeps the meal hot from start to finish (Anyone else hate eating cold food that's meant to be hot?!). The bibimbap comes with a soup (chicken soup unfortunately) and ranges between $11-15, which is on the more expensive end of bibimbaps.   The two things about this place that I don't like are how small the tables are and the harsh spotlight shining down on you. The side tables are so small and closely arranged that it is difficult to get to your seat without your bum grazing the side of the table beside you. The harsh spotlight makes it look like you are in an interrogation room with the person you're eating dinner with lol. But if you don't mind these little details, come to Koryo for some authentic, delicious bibimbap (they do takeout too)!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place and so glad we went in. Menu is not big, but has all the stuff I want. We ordered the veal bibimbap, bulgogi and seafood pancake. Everything was cooked very well and had lots of fresh ingredients. Bibimbap has tons of veggies instead of rice filler, which we really appreciated. Pancake was mostly scallion and shrimps, which was very good. I rarely eat bulgogi, but this was seasoned very well and enjoyable.  Side dishes were different from the usual places I've been so it was refreshing. Prices are a little bit higher than what I'm used to, but only about $1-2. Completely worth it and I will be back"}
{"text":"Went there for chicken soup last night @9:25ish, Yelped it out since I felt like having some hot soup after long hard day working both offsite and in the clinic till 9pm.  Waited for them to clean the table and sat down. (That's around 9:25ish) Then one \"friendly waitress\" said \"our kitchen is closed please order within 5 minutes\". Actually it's not a problem for a big foodie like me since I know what I'm there for and I'm familiar with the dishes a typical Korean restaurant can offer. It's just her attitudes that set me off. I asked how can we place order if the kitchen is closed? She just kept repeating the same sentence and acted like I don't understand English... If the kitchen closes @ 9:30pm, then your business hour should be 9:30. I usually can overlook the lacking service and just go for the food, but this time we left for other place.      Bad timing...."}
{"text":"Pros:cleanest Korean restaurant I have ever been. Food and appetizers taste awesome!! I ordered a tofu beef soup and my friend ordered a beef bibimbap. Both taste great.  Cons: not much- take out is a lot cheaper than eating in($2 cheaper on average)"}
{"text":"Had to go to this area to run an errand on a weekday, so I went on yelp and found this place! Its signature dish is their samgyetang (Ginseng Chicken soup).  One of the reasons that I like about Korean Cuisine is their banchan. I like how I have a bunch of small dishes to munch on while waiting for the food.  My favourite is the black sesame dressing on lettuce, it balances out the heat from the real veal bibimbap (i need to increase my spicy tolerance)  Samgyetang $16.99  Perfect when the weather is cold. Your whole body gets warm after eating this. They give you a whole baby chicken and it is stuffed with sticky rice. If you think the soup a little bit blend, you can add a little bit of salt from the small container on the table.  I didn't add any but I pour a little on my spoon just to make sure it is not sugar   Raw Veal Bibimbap $12.95 Don't get scared by the word raw, it will get cooked completely while mixing because the bowl is so hot. Veal was really flavourful and every ingredients goes together well in the bowl. My first time eating that white jello thing which was interesting to me, like the texture but it doesn't really taste like anything  I think this became one of my winter-to-go place!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for an early dinner. This restuarant is located in a plaza so parking can be quite hectic around here. The shop itself is quite small and dark inside. I got the samgytang (korean chicken soup with glutinous rice and ginseng) for $17.99. It also came with a small size of noodle to put in the soup. Theres a side of salt on the table for those who think the soup is a bit bland. I dont think it is bland at all, this is how its suppose to taste like without the msg. I thought it was ok. The chicken is stuffed with glutinous rice with one date, ginseng, and chestnut. So in terms of ingredients it was pretty legit. And I wasnt thirsty at all afterwards so im pretty sure theres no msg. My friend got the hamburger steak with rice cake, rice and a fried egg for $14.99. She said it was quite good as well. There were 6 side dishes that came with our meal. You can ask for more if you finished it. We got the kimchi radish, cucumber, japchae, eggplant, green salad, and seasoned root. Service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"The food is good - this is probably one of the better Korean restaurant locations I've tried in North York (outside of the Koreatown strip on Yonge between Finch and Sheppard). I find that their soup bases are blander than a lot of places downtown but maybe it's just more authentic that way.  I really enjoy G1 yang gom tang and the soft tofu jigae. However it's not a 5/5 for me - they sometimes forget to provide included menu items like soup and also they don't have kimchi! Not sure why but each time I go there is never kimchi, and I don't see others who have it in their side dishes either. You can ask for side dish refills but I just find it so weird without kimchi."}
{"text":"Such a clean, modern place with friendly staff. Both my boyfriend and I got Samgaetang. It was a lot of food as you get the whole chicken that is stuffed with glutinous rice, a ginseng, a date, and herbs per pot. Their complimentary side dishes were better than the ones I had at other Korean restaurants in GTA. It wasn't so flavourful, but that's how it is supposed to taste if you don't  put MSG a lot (I am not sure if they use any MSG in the soup). In Korea, we eat this dish to \"boost up\" our energy. It really did for both of us! We were very satisfied with the food and the service.   They do accept credit card along with cash and debit. It is located in a big plaza, so parking is not a problem. I would come back to try other menus."}
{"text":"the staff were very friendly and welcoming! delicious raw veal bibimbap and chicken ginseng soup! Side dishes are very fresh as well. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the raw veal bibimbap ($12.99).   The seasoned vegetables (which topped the bibimbap) were fresh and meticulously prepared; some were also uncommon like the acorn jelly. But the veal itself was just okay; there wasn't much taste to it besides the gochujang. And because its minced, the veal becomes non-existent when everything mix together."}
{"text":"I have been to quite many different restaurant all around yonge area or uptown but I like this one the best. their small dish is soooo good, the main course is soooo good. I tried the ginseng chicken soup, the bibimbap with the raw veal, the kimchi fried rice with hotstone and a few things which I couldn't remember. They are all really good. It is a place that I will keep going back even the price is a little more compare to the others. But it's totally worth that few dollars!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I tried the chicken soup and bibimbap while we came by. The soup lives up to its reputation; it's clean yet hearty taste really come through and enhance its light chicken flavor. The bibimbap was a fantastic contrast with its vibrant spicy meat and fresh veggies. Definitely one of the better Korean places in GTA."}
{"text":"Came here for new years to have my traditional Korean rice cake and dumpling soup. One of the better places to have it compared to any other Korean restaurants I've been to.   The banchan (side dishes) were great in selections, taste and freshness.   Check out my pics! Loved every single dish that my party ordered. If I'm craving the soup and the kalbi appetizer I will go here!  Decent prices and portions. Clean and good service.   Come here if you're in the area. Not too many Korean restaurants in the area so if you're craving traditional Korean food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Known for their ginseng chicken soup so we came here specifically for that. It is a bowl of bubbling broth with a whole young chicken in it, stuffed with sticky rice. The broth itself was tasty and very subtle in flavour. You may need to add some salt to it from the large salt bowl on your table. The chicken was tender but parts of the breast meat were dry. In my opinion, I didn't taste enough ginseng. I probably wouldn't order this again, but I'd recommend everyone to try it at least once.  It's a great order for anyone who isn't feeling well.  There were many side dishes included, as expected from a Korean restaurant. They were more premium than that of most Korean restaurants.  Interestingly, kimchi wasn't one of them.  We also ordered the seafood green onion pancake and mungbean pancake. They were both crispy and flavourful, and came with a vinegar-based dipping sauce.  The service was friendly. We were promptly identified as newcomers, so our waitress walked us through how our food was commonly eaten.  The decor was nice. Pretty modern. There is lots of parking in the plaza parking lot."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out because of its great reviews and I'm always looking for new korean spots. I got the spicy tofu and seafood hotpot stew which is one of my favourite korean dishes alongside bibimbap. It was pretty average tasting in my opinion, as the stew lacked flavour but I did enjoy the clams and mussels within. I originally wanted to get the tofu stew with dumplings, which my friend ended up ordering, however the dumplings had beef inside. Just a heads up for any fellow non-meat eaters! Overall, I still enjoyed my meal and if I was in the area again I would probably come back to try another dish"}
{"text":"\"Delicate and light\" is how I would describe their food. The infamous Korean Ginseng Chicken soup is very light in flavour with only the slightest hint of ginseng. The chicken is super tender but did not have a whole lot of flavour either. The dish as a whole seem to lack a bit of salt and the flavour profile is subtle.  I can describe the bibimbap and other items in the same manner. The portions are on the slightly smaller side for your typical Korean fare and the prices are on the higher end of the spectrum I would say.  However, you can really taste the quality and freshness of the ingredients that they use in their cooking. Their menu is also smaller than most.  I would say this place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"It's good Asian food at a decent price (~$15 incl tax & tip). The main course of rice and meat is prepared deliciously, and the complimentary Korean vegetable dishes complement the meal. It filled me up nicely without being overfull.  The waitresses were attentive and the food came from the kitchen fast enough. It's interesting how this business runs 365 days a year, how it contrasts with all the other businesses in the plaza being non-Asian, and how the menu contains English and Korean and Chinese."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good ambience. Service was quick. I ordered the chicken dupbap. It was tasty however food portion a bit small."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this place after visiting our doctor in the area. Without having the chance to check the Yelp at yet, we were definitely pleasantly surprised. (It was reassuring to me after placing my order that this place had pretty good reviews.) The ginseng chicken soup (sam gae tang) is excellent here! We tried the bimbimbap and it was great as well. Very authentic place and all the other customers in the restaurant with us were Koreans."}
{"text":"For a highly rated Korean place, this was such a disappointment. Maybe we also made the mistake of not ordering their signature dish, chicken ginseng. We got the bimbimbap and Kimchi fried rice. I've never experienced this, but although the stone pot for my bibimbap was hot, the rice did my even stick to the pot to create that slight crust of rice this dish is known for. The meat also felt very unfresh and the combination of veggies didn't even give the rice any flavour. The portions were also very small. I don't think I've had a worse bimbimbap before. The Kimchi fried rice was also very bland and flavourless. Overall was a poor food experience. I'm not sure if this place gets such high reviews for its chicken ginseng, but if it can't even get a bimbimbap right, I don't have much faith in coming back to try other things."}
{"text":"Pretty unique menu offerings here. I ordered the ginseng chicken soup. I totally recommend this place just for this dish. A tip would be to use the salt provided at the table to bring out the flavours in the soup. I guess this is a hidden gem in a quiet neighbourhood. They say to drink this soup in the summer 3 times for health benefits  - once beginning, middle and end of season."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in a small strip plaza. My first time having Korean ginseng chicken soup - decided to try that since it's their specialty. Whole chicken was very moist, soft, fall-off-the-bone. Stuffed with glutinous rice, it is pretty filling! Just wish there were more red dates and chestnut for more flavor. The soup itself is very clear and subtle (can barely taste the ginseng),and it's great for a cold day. Comes with white noodles.   I really liked the side dishes as well - black sesame dressing salad, spicy cucumbers, eggplant."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner.  Pretty good.  Ginseng chicken soup 5/5.  Korean seafood pancake 5/5 i thought their pancake was very good considering i usually don't like the korean pancakes that much but i couldn't stop eating this one.  This Korean pancake is smaller than ones i had at  other places, but tasted a lot better.  Loved it!  Service and attentiveness 5/5.  Price value very good.  side dishes 5/5.  The experience was almost perfect, but the fried pork in my katsudon was not crispy at all and was a little soggy.  Katsudon 2/5.  Everything else was very good. I will definitely come back!  Ginseng chicken & pancake must try!    (Unable to upload pix....will upload when i can)"}
{"text":"This is a small and crowded restaurant. the food was good. the waiters were nice."}
{"text":"Located in a small plaza in North York. A cozy Korean restaurant. Even though we were standing outside we were greeted right away and directed to our seats. Order the blood sausage soup, it came with rice. It was a bit spicy for my taste but it was good. The sides were okay, oh you can order more of the sides it comes with the meal.   Great service, friendly staff and good food. I would come back again, but I would try something else."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night for dinner. It's a pretty small place. Ordered the spicy pork deopbap and my girlfriend ordered a bibimbap.  The pork was pretty tasty and I liked the stone bowl, but I didn't find anything else too special about it. It also came with a small soup. I'd like to come back to try their chicken ginseng soup though."}
{"text":"I'm rarely impressed by Korean cuisine (sorry, just never been blown away by it), but Koryo Samgaetang's food makes a great first impression. The Spicy Pork DupBap comes with a generous portion of sliced pork, marinated in a sweet spicy sauce with onions and green onions on white rice. The best part is that it's served in a sizzling stone pot, hot enough to change the soft rice to a crispy golden crust over the course of the meal. I gleefully pressed the rice to all available surfaces and waited for the transformation. Give it a little patience and self-control, and you will be able to scrap off large whole pieces of crunchy rice off the stone pot. The texture of the rice is amazing and rarely obtained by other stone pot places. I would go back for that alone! Their side dishes are also great, unique choices that paired perfectly with the Dupbap. There was one dish of thin dark green root-like vegetables that I've never had before. We liked it so much we asked for seconds! This place will become my new standard for stone pot dishes for the future."}
{"text":"My experience was good. It has a nice fusion feel to the place with the modern music they play. Their food is served in pretty utensils. It's a small little restaurant but a nice cozy place to drink some soup.   I ordered the bimbimbap hot stone - it was good and the koryo chicken soup- i think it could have been boiled a bit longer but the chicken was soft and tender. I like the stick rice in the middle of the chicken. I liked their side dishes a lot !!   I didn't feel very bloated after this meal which I personally liked."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Location: 4/5  We came here on a Wednesday night and the place was quieter than we expected (for such great Yelp reviews!). It's located in a little plaza that I've passed by hundreds of times and I've never noticed this place!  I ordered a hot stone spicy pork dupbap and it was BOMB. It came out steaming and sizzling in the hot stone bowl, with just the right about of spice. The spicy pork was slightly fatty, sliced thin, and crispy. Once all mixed together the dish was a vibrant red, just what I want to see when I'm craving Korean food.   And of course we can't forget the banchan (Korean side dishes). They had all the usual suspects: pickled cucumbers, fish cake, kimchi, potatoes. I particularly enjoyed the salad with a unique black sesame dressing - something I can't say I've seen before.  Overall, really tasty! I can't believe I've never been here before; it's pretty hidden unless you're actually out looking for it. I would recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Ordered: Chicken Bokkeutan (mediocre, get something else; I was particularly disappointed because this order is big enough for tw)  PROS + DECOR: modern, dim lit. It was rather romantic.   CONS  - STAFF: mediocre, almost nonexistent. This almost comes across as racist, & I assure you it isn't, but the waitresses need to learn English. It is increasingly frustrating trying to communicate what you want when the person on the other end doesn't understand the words coming out of your mouth. The use of gestures is mildly helpful...but rather limiting. Also, I didn't appreciate that a group of 2 came 10 minutes after me (I was in a pair as well), ordered 20 minutes after me, and received their food 10 minutes before me. That. Is. Shady.  - APPS: This place doesn't have mashed potatoes or a potato appetizer at all. That was thoroughly disappointing. I had already been waiting at the restaurant for a good half hour before getting seated (the waitress asked a table of 2 if they could take 1 of their 2 tables --stacked together--why couldn't you have done that when I first got to the restaurant?) when I asked if the apps could come out. I had already ordered...I was just patiently waiting. The waitress, who probably didn't understand my request, replied, \"the apps come with the food.\" If I'm going to get the apps sooner or later, why does it friggen matter what time they come out at?"}
{"text":"I visit this restaurant once every few months with family whenever we don't particularly feel like cooking. Located at the pickle barrel plaza right at Leslie and mcnicoll/cummer, it is a convenient location with lots of parking. I do find that this place is a bit on the pricier side compared to other Korean restaurants, but the quality is definitely high   When here for dinner the standard choices we get are the chicken ginseng soup and a hot stone bibimbap. I've tried several other restaurants that offer the chicken ginseng soup, but the one here is probably one of the best I've tried - you can actually taste the ginseng. Pay the extra couple dollars for bibimbap in the hot stone pot-it's worth it!  The side dishes also never disappoint, and they always offer to refill them when they notice we have finished it."}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming our go-to spot for clean Korean dining experience.  As I mentioned in my previous review, I love the care they take with something as small as their serving bowls and dishes.  The attention to detail is what keeps on bringing me back here.  Oh yes, and the food is not bad either.    We ordered Yang Gom Tang (spicy beef and small intestine soup), Hae Jang Tang (aka Hangover soup with loads of blood jello) and the scallion pancake.    Yang Gom Tang was definitely on the spicy side which I loved.  I'd imagine most diners will have an issue with the level of spiciness if what I had was their norm.  My hearty bowl of beefy soup was loaded with small intestine bits, beef, potato noodles and veggies.  It was perfect for a cold snowy day and really warmed up the belly.    My mom's Hae Jang Tang looked good but she said she didn't like the way they prepared the blood jello - too hard.  I ended up having a lot of her blood jello but I didn't find the texture unusually hard or spongey.  Different palates, I guess.  Her soup though had too much of the doen-jang (korean miso) taste and I personally preferred my soup which was just beefy and spicy.    The scallion pancake was fairly standard.  A little smallish for the price you pay ($11.99) but prepared well.  It's not something I like ordering as I can make a pretty decent one at home so my expectation is high when I do order it at a restaurant.  Let's just say, I'll stick to making this dish at home.    Their banchan is usually good but the radish kimchi and the braised black beans (tooth breakingly hard) were way off this day.  And most Korean food fans know, you can't have a great korean meal without a good kimchi."}
{"text":"Another stellar visit. Once again got the veal bibimbap. Its a simple dish that I have had so many times but its just done so right in this place. All the ingredients are so fresh and you can tell they do not skimp out on quality either. Down to the red pepper paste sauce which I mentioned before is the good stuff probably shipped straight from Korea.  During my last visit there was no kimchii as a side dish which really threw me off. I think that was the first time I ate at a Korean restaurant with no kimchii BUT during my latest visit Kimchii was present which put a big smile on my face.    Also during my last visit I mentioned how spot on the service was. This time around was no different. It was the same waitress as before. When she brought out all the side dishes she described what each dish was. During my meal I was asked how my meal was and on two different occasions she asked if I wanted more side dishes. I declined because I was dinning alone this time and had more than enough side dishes for myself. Her service made me feel like I was dinning at a 5 star fancy restaurant.     Another well deserved 5 star visit"}
{"text":"It's been 2.5 years since my first reviw of this place and it is STILL one of my top choices for korean food. Their tofu soups are a lot spicer than other places but it is also not full of MSG. If you cant take spicy, just ask for half if not nne at all ;) The ladies there are always super nice and accomodating!"}
{"text":"Just a block away from my house. This place could become my \"spicy tofu soup\" go to. I am going to go back to try the ginseng soup. Bibimbap was average. Good appetizers, the cucumber was my favorite."}
{"text":"Totally rolled the dice with Yelp on this one as it was rated a solid 4 overall.  Airy restaurant with very friendly service. The restaurant had a lineup by the time we finished. The dishes were pretty  We had Kalbi patty Japchae - I don't know that I've had these sweet potato noodles served over (hard) rice before Tonkatsu set  I really like Korean food and this it was small very bland and disappointing. I don't know if we ordered the wrong things for this particular place. I would give it 2-2.5."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Especially the kimchi fried rice! Service was really friendly. There was a long line up when we got there but the wait wasn't long. Price was decent."}
{"text":"I'm not Korean.  My parents aren't Korean.  BUT when faced with a decision of where to dine for a family birthday - my father's first choice was Koryo on Leslie Street.    This restaurant has a beautiful interior.  Like the interior, the food as well is clean and crisp.  The servers were very gracious and polite.  Prices are reasonable and the portion of food is modest.    The food is delicious.  The menu is easy to navigate.  The spicy pork tastes home made.    In addition, they are good with children.  There is a baby seat and they provide additional plates and cutlery as needed."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this Korean restaurant! I've been a sucker for Korean ginseng chicken soup (samgaetang) ever since I went to Korea earlier this year. So I was extremely excited to try out this place!   First off, looking at their menu, they had a variety of Korean ginseng chicken soup like green tea (very interesting). We ordered the original to try and it came with a small bowl of noodles to put into the steaming stew. The whole chicken, stuffed with glutinous rice, was a good size to share, and the meat was so tender! The broth is light and refreshing, definitely tasted natural (msg free). There is salt provided to adjust the taste needed. I can see why Koryo is infamous for their samgaetang!  We also ordered their beef bibimbap. It served in a hot stone pot which cooked the fresh yolk and made the rice crispy. What I love most about this was, in addition to the typical vegetables (carrots, bean sprouts and spinach), it was topped off with Korean green bean jelly - Very unique and tasty!   Overall, I'm impressed with this place! They're clean and have friendly service. The servers take time to list off the side dishes provided and to explain how to eat each entree. I wish it was closer to home! All in all, would I come back? MOST DEFINITELY!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue! I have been coming here 2-3 times a month for about a year now. I have yet to find another restaurant that beats this place in quality of food and side dishes. Their kimchi (radish and cucumber) is consistently phenomenal and keeps us coming back. They specially in samgaetang which is a special healthy and delicious chicken soup (with rice and noodles) but my  boyfriend is obsessed with the spicy pork which is served sizzling on a hot plate with rice and side soup. Everything I have tasted so far has not disappointed up. The girls that work here are also amazing and get to know the familiar faces. They make sure to refill your side dishes and check up on you."}
{"text":"Koryo Samgaetang is not bad. They serve tasty broth based dishes that pair really well with Toronto weather. Their ginseng chicken soup with whole chicken is their go to dish. A little bland for my taste, salt and pepper are both available at every table for you to season to our preference.   Except to queue when you arrive for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here on a windy Sunday night and it was the perfect type of food for it. The place is fairly small so seating is tight, our table waited for about 15-20 mins before getting seated.  The menu is fairly simple with a lot of soups. The signature soup with a whole chicken and ginseng is definitely worth a try. I enjoyed it a lot and I'd definitely get it on days when I feel like getting something soupy."}
{"text":"Very interesting first visit. We haven't had much experience with Korean food but decided to try considering the positive reviews and close proximity to home. Our server was lovely. Her English was not great but made a sincere effort to explain the menu and food. She had a lovely smile and was so courteous . The restaurant was very clean and very nicely laid out. The food was very good although I once again admit my limited experience with traditional Korean fare.  In short, I enjoyed our visit and will likely return to explore more of the menu and become better acquainted with Korean food."}
{"text":"Winter just won't go away this year.  Had our soccer practice cancelled because of hail in MAY!!!  Decided to try out this place since it was near by.  In the end, it just didn't feel like I had Korean food though..  Pros: Ginseng Chicken soup that can't be found at most Korean restaurants Very well done side dishes  Cons: Pricey for a Korean restaurant Not much variety in menu No Gamjatang??  Blasphemy!!  So having never tried Korean ginseng chicken soup, we decided to give this place a whirl.  The first thing I notice is the sign with a couple of menu choices.  I can already tell it's pricey because bibimbap here is $11.99.  That's at least 3-4 dollars more than your average Korean restaurant.  After having a seat and looking at the menu, you find there's really not much variety.  Apart from the 5 types of ginseng soup and 3-4 types of bimbimbap, and some soon tofu, there's not much more to the menu.  I don't know if I sound silly, but a Korean restaurant without Gamjatang seems wrong to me..  The side dished that come out are all very well done and presented.  The salad has a black sesame dressing which I really loved.  The staff also do not hesitate to refill any of them for you.  We order the ginseng soup since it's the specialty.  When it comes out it's still boiling hot, which is a good thing for me.  The soup contains a whole young chicken and some onions.  I see nothing more.  Inside the chicken is some stuffing consisting of rice, a date, and a small piece of ginseng.  They give you some noodles to put in the soup too.  The chicken has been cooking in the soup for a very long time.  This works for and against it though.  The chicken is fall off the bone, but because it's been cooking for so long it's become quite dry and tasteless really.  After finishing it, I was still quite hungry.  Even being a whole chicken, it's still quite small and you only have soup to eat.  It definitely doesn't leave you filled.  It's about 15.99-25.99 depending on which soup you order.  For that price, I want to at least be full at the end.  When I go to a Korean restaurant I usually end up really full while not breaking the bank.  I got neither at this place so it seems weird for me.  The soup was really well done but it definitely left me a little unsatisfied.  All in all still a decent place, just won't be going back often myself."}
{"text":"Decent place for Korean food. Not a very large restaurant so you might need to wait if you go during peak hours. Service is good and you get the traditional Korean appetizers *except for the potatoes*! Which I thought was a shame. I hope they add this soon!  Food is reasonably priced for size and taste. I would come back if I were in the area and craving some Korean food. It is kinda noisy though, so not my choice for a first date place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon- there were only two servers working and service was a little slow but they were very nice and apologetic about it.   The food: - Banchan: the are very generous with the appetizers here, the little spicy cucumbers and japchae are my favorite 4/5 - Beef bone soup: dumplings/ rice cake/ egg white drop in a milky beef bone broth soup 4/5 - Dolsot bibimbap: so many toppings! There wasn't as many crunchy bits at the bottom of the stone bowl, however, probably one of the better bibimbaps I've had in the GTA so far 3/5  Tip: don't shy from using that big tub of salt on the table- you will have to season some dishes  yourself (ie: beef bone soup)   Looking forward to coming back to try the other menu items. Will definitely go out of the way to come here!"}
{"text":"I came here with a big group of friends recently. They were able to accommodate the ten of us in the small space. The decor is homey with lots of wood detail. The menu is concise with lots of the biggest hits of Korean food like bipbimbop and multiple korean soups/stews. I decided to split the ginseng chicken soup or samgyetang that's their specialty. I was not disappointed. A whole stuffed cornish hen came in a boiling hot stone bowl with a small plate of noodles. I would have liked more noodles (because they are my jam), however once you split the chicken open to reveal the stuffing the rice inside adds to the dish. This dish has a very delicate flavour that is different than most Korean dishes I've ever had. We also shared the seafood pancake (mostly green onion, but delicious), short rib patty (would simply prefer short ribs, too much sweetness and not enough umami) and spicy rice cake (delicious, but nothing to write home about). I also tried the Kimchi fried rice, which strangely tasted like butter to me, but still had the delicious taste of kimchi with pork. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are in the area, but go for their special chicken soup."}
{"text":"I go here whenever I'm feeling a little low on energy. The portion may not be enough for heavy eaters. I have tried Original & Green Tea & Perilla, and think that Green Tea is the best out of the three.  I personally wouldn't recommend other menus just because they're average at best in comparison to other restaurants."}
{"text":"What a better way to battle the Canadian cold with a pot of ginseng whole chicken soup?   I didn't think I had the appetite to eat this alone. I mean really! - it's a whole young chicken stuffed with sticky rice and chestnuts. Somehow I polished the entire pot by myself with no traces or resemblances of what I ordered. The soup - aromatic with a hint of ginseng flavor. Since the young chicken barely had any body fat, the soup itself was not one bit greasy. I especially loved that I was given the option of salting the soup myself.   Although I enjoyed my pot - I had the seafood version which came with scallop, sea cucumber, shrimp, and mussel, I'm going to stick to their regular chicken soup next visit since I thought the amount of seafood given was not justified with the cost difference. I got one shrimp, one mussel, 3 baby scallops, and 4 pieces of chopped up sea cucumber. It was about 7 dollars more! Nevertheless the chicken soup itself - the chicken was so silky and soft - I'm craving another one already!   Overall - solid choice for ginseng chicken soup! Will definitely return to try out their famous raw beef bibimbap too!"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch and ordered S1, the whole chicken with stuffed ginseng, rice, dates, and other nuts and herbs. It was good and the portion was decent for what you pay for, although it was a bit too bland for my personal preference. The customer service was 10/10, the waitress saw me struggling to eat the chicken, so she asked me if I would like her to help me open up the chicken and eat it the proper way. She got a new set of utensils and broke the chicken into pieces, and mixed it with the soup, rice and noodles.  I would recommend their soups for colder days since the ingredients (and also the temperature) are warmer. The environment was quite and slightly dim, great for small groups. The only reason why i gave it a 4 star is because there was nothing too special that will make me want to go back again. But I would definitely recommend it to friends who have never been to try it out."}
{"text":"We had not been here for a while and decided to go back today. This is good Hanjongsik, and reminds me of the Shilla Dynasty Royal-style dining establishments one finds in Korea.  The food is METICULOUSLY prepared at this restaurant.  The flavours are deep and natural and not a lot of salt which is the sign of an above-average restaurant.  I really love this place.  As I said in my earlier review, no taste of dashida or salt, just pure, natural, gorgeous Hansik.  The baechu kimchi was perfectly seasoned as was the cucumber kimchi (in thick, luscious gochuchang).  Spouse and I need to visit this gem of a restaurant more often!"}
{"text":"Mom wanted to have samgaetang, so we went for lunch, place was quiet, service was good. She ordered the S1, I ordered G3, she enjoyed her soup, I find that the beef broth was really bland though.I thought price is reasonable but I think that next time maybe just stick with samgaetang."}
{"text":"A lot of choices for bibimbap & ginseng chicken soup ( with a small bowl of noodle) The pork cutlet on rice is surprisingly good, highly recommended  The plaza has a lot of parking  Service is friendly The overall dinner is very entertaining  Will definitely come back and try their seafood pancake"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. It's located in a plaza just north of Finch on Leslie. Overall I found everything quite pleasant - service was fast, polite and friendly, the restaurant is not huge (12 tables?) but clean, the food came at good temperature and quite tasty.   We had the regular ginseng chicken soup ($15.93) and the grilled short rib patty ($9.99). The ginseng chicken is stuffed with sticky rice and the soup comes with some noodles so there was no need to add any rice. The grilled short rib patty also had two half-sliced thick rice cake.   We found the short rib patty very tasty - it's not too oily because its made with minced meat mixed with korean dates, pinenuts and chestnuts which gave it a nice chewy texture, plus a nice aroma to it. They'd pour the bbq sauce on the patty at the table for you, and the staff even put her hand over the hot plate to make sure nothing gets sprayed onto me.   Also, the staff came to check on us two times and were quite responsive every time we asked for something.   We enjoyed it - will be back, and will bring more friends!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Probably the best Korean food we've had in a while. Im a huge fan of the bimibap, the ingredients were fresh! We also tried their delicious Yang Gom Tang soup. There may be a line-up during peak hours, but definitely worth the wait. Service is super quick!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely horrible. I am not quite certain how this place got 4/5. I may not have gotten their traditional samgyetang soup but paying $11 for a spicy soup with literally just beansprouts and 4 pieces of pork blood was absolutely absurd. The taste was not very good and the staff were not friendly. I would NOT go back."}
{"text":"The menu is pretty simple and most of the dishes are just a variation of another. We ordered the kimchi fried rice and the beef jigae. The meal came with a lot of starters that I've never had before, and the waitress was very kind and attentive and offered to refill our starters for us. Overall the food is decently priced and very good. Quite spicy too!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem randomly on Yelp. We got there around 1:30 and waited for a few mins to be seated. Service was very welcoming and attentive.   I ordered the bulgogi dupbap which came with a chicken soup. The food came out unexpectedly fast. The bulgogi dupbap was flavourful and had a lot of beef. The portion size is decent - just enough to get full. The soup wasn't as special as I thought it would be.  It tasted like the normal chicken broth (which is a bit bland imo).  Food and service is good. I may return to try their special chicken ginseng soup, which they're famous for. I recommend making a reservation at this place as it gets really busy."}
{"text":"This is fun and trendy Korean restaurant has delicious food, and each dish is a unique experience.  Koryo is located inside a strip mall off Leslie street. You can tell the restaurant all the way from the street - whereas all of the other businesses have boring-looking signs in Times New Roman, Koryo's sign is lit up with Korean characters that seem to dance and beckon you inside.  When you do come inside, you'll find a small but comfortable interior. They have stylish tables, and there are very attractive pictures of their dishes on the walls, along with descriptions of what they are.  Once you pick what you want (either from the menu or just from the wall photos), the food arrives extremely quickly - and it's usually scalding hot. For appetizers, we really enjoyed both pancake dishes: the seafood and scallion pancake, as well as the mung bean pancake. The banchan that come with everything were good, but I've had better at other Korean restaurants. For main dishes, we enjoyed their spicy soup dishes the most. They also have samgyetang (their signature dish) and bibimbaps, but personally I found the samgyetang lacking in spice and the bibimbaps good but not amazing. Your mileage my vary. Regardless what you get, it's all exceedingly photogenic, which makes it look nice on the Yelp photos!  We've been here multiple times and have always loved it. Check it out for an authentic and delightful Korean experience."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff! Full menu with lots to choose from. The ginseng chicken soup was definitely the highlight - the chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender and the soup was flavourful. It comes with a small amount of noodles which was really smooth. The sticky rice inside the chicken soaked up all the soup and tasted amazing! Other things you must try include the seafood pancake and the mushroom bibimbap. The seafood pancake is probably the best one I have had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"It has been one of our family favourite Korean restaurants.   We usually order the Koryo Samgyetang, whole young chicken stuffed with ginseng, sticky rice, Korean dates, chestnut and herbs. The soup is very rich in ginseng and give you energy in a cold winter.   Special Seol Leong Tang, the milky color cow bone and parts soup is very healthy to the skin.   My favourite is Hot Stone raw veal Bibimbap. The hot sauce is yummy with the raw veal. The quality is very good.   Banchan (side dishes) are very fresh and delicious.   Service is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Went today around 3pm with my family for a late lunch and I thought it was really good. I've been craving for some Korean food (I blame it on the Korean drama \"Let's Eat\" season 2) and this place just hit the spot. It's one of the best Korean restaurants I've been to and I'm for sure going again.   The service was good, the waitress was really nice to us and she made sure we were enjoying our food. It wasn't busy when we went but it wasn't empty either. We didn't have to wait long for our food which was great since I was STARVING!   My mum and I ordered the samgyetang ($15.93) and it was super filling. I almost couldn't finish it but it was so good I couldn't stop eating! Their side dishes, especially their kimchi, was really good. My 3 year old sister loved their Japchae! I forgot what my dad ordered but he really liked it (I think it's G1 on the menu..) he asked for it to be mild and that's what he got. (It wasn't spicy for me at all but then again my tolerance to spicy food is high)   All in all, I do recommend this place. They're open 365 days a year (that's what they said on the door) from 11AM-10:30PM. It's called KORYO by the way."}
{"text":"I came into Koryo by reading the Yelp reviews on how spectacular this place was ... & damn, it held up.    I decided to depart from my usual pork bone soup and have the hot stone bowl. This was the best foodie decision of my life.   I got the bulgogi hot stone bowl. The bowl was off the fire hot and it baked the bottom of my rice till it was nice and crisp (make sure you stir it so it doesn't become a large piece of burnt chip though).  The flavouring was amazing. Everything just meshed so well. I'm speechless.   My family always get the chicken soup (their feature). This gives you an entire chicken boiled in some good ass soup ... I don't remember what it's called but, you know :) it's the main one - I'm sure you'll find it.   My sister got the tofu soup the first time. The tofu was smooth and literally delicious but 100% way too spicy when she asked for less spicy. The second time she got the pork bone soup and asked for no spice. She was very specific and the waitress asked her if little spicy was okay. My sister agreed but only if it was the littlest spicy possible. The soup was spicy asf. Therefore, 0.5 star off.  Yet, the side dishes are delicious and unique to other Korean restaurants.   The place is VERY small and seats roughly 8 tables of 4.  That means long wait times. Thankfully, we've always managed to make it before the rush.   0.5 star off for the inattentiveness of the servers after having served the food. Refills of tea or getting the cheque takes a very long time.   I'll def come back if I'm in the area or craving a good hot stone bowl."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for dinner because I was craving for some good Korean food...and while searching on Yelp, I came across this restaurant and decided to give it a try for the high ratings.   The restaurant is located in a plaza and can be a little hard to spot because it blended with the other stores. The decor of this restaurant is modern and clean which gave a good impression.   I ordered the bibimbap ($10.99). I found it a little smaller than most places but it was perfect for me (and my small size) because I managed to finish it all! I also liked how the sauce came in this little tube, you can also have soy lemon sauce, which is an interesting option. It also came with 6 side dishes, and was surprised that this place didn't serve kimchi!   Overall, I would come back to the other dishes, including their ginseng chicken soup, which is what it looks like it is known for!"}
{"text":"Spent some time in Seoul a lifetime ago. This place is the real deal. Authentic and tasty. Be prepared to wait for a table on occasion though."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.  Apparently this place is known for their ginseng chicken soup, but I was slightly disappointed. Or maybe I'm slightly bias because I had it in Korea so I expected more... Ginseng Chicken Soup ($16.99) A full chicken stuffed with sticky rice inside, and supposedly a piece of ginseng. I thought it was a little too expensive for what it's worth - I understand you get a full chicken, but the ginseng part was disappointing. Only that tiny little piece, let alone the soup had little to none ginseng flavor. Overall the soup was bland but felt healthy in that sense. The chicken mean was soft and tender so that was nice, not dry. On the menu they had other flavors of ginseng chicken, I tried normal but they had others such as green tea flavor which I found quite interesting.   Yang Gom Tang ($14.99) Spicy korean broth soup made with cow bones and eggs, brisket with potato noodles, cow's stomach and intestines. Had a decent amount of meat, the soup in general was strong in cow flavor. This was actually pretty spicy, very flavorful.   I do like how they have a variety of side dishes. Half the reason why I really like korean food is cause of the side dishes. Prices for food are more expensive than other typical Korean restaurants. Overall the food was good, I would come back."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Koryo Samgyetang. To me, it's a warm and inviting environment - modern looking restaurant with a modern flair.  I've been told that if you've come down with a bad case of the cold, you must get the Koryo Samgyetang (I mean... they ARE named after it...). Boiled down, it's the Korean version of chicken noodle soup, but with a few different ingredients: ginseng, sticky rice, Korean dates and chestnuts that are stuffed inside a miniature chicken. Your order also comes with a small plate of noodles that you drop in the soup.  Key note: the soup itself is a bit plain, but that's normal. They let you control the amount of salt that goes in. Taste it first, and adjust accordingly.  Once you got the seasoning down, the dish itself is really delicious. The chicken is really soft and tender, the Korean dates give it a nice sweetness, and the rest help bring it all together.  I took a small bite of the wife's Dolsot Bibimbap and her words, although as funny as it sounds, rings kind of true: \"It's too healthy...\" Maybe that's a good thing? Maybe it's not. Take it with a grain of salt... it's literally there on your table :)  If it's your first time, go for what they're known for. A restaurant's specialty dish really does speak volumes."}
{"text":"I have a thing for herbal soups and their samgaetang is on my favourites list. The small chicken was stuffed with glutinous rice and herbs and was served in a stone bowl with the herb and ginseng soup. This place would be amazing in the winter for a hot soup to warm you up!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Korean restaurant for ginseng chicken soup. They have a few varieties including green tea ginseng which keeps things interesting but my favourite is the original one. I also really like the mushroom bibimbap which is surprisingly tasty! The only menu items that were disappointing were the spicy tofu soup series (with seafood, kimchi, or dumplings) which didn't have a lot of stuff other than tofu. It is a small restaurant that gets quite busy on the weekends so I suggest going earlier/later than typical meal times."}
{"text":"You do need to order Korean Ginseng Chicken Soup when you visit Korean Ginseng Chicken Soup & Bibimbap.  Koyro Samgeytang ($15.99) uses 30 day \"young\" chicken from a local farm up in Orangeville was really tender. The ginseng flavour is quite subtle so even if you don't like the smell or taste of ginseng, give this a try. Chicken Ginseng Soup supposed to be good for your health and consume especially during the hottest day of the year. But for me, any day is good for some soup especially when it is cold and snowy out!  Beef Bone Soup with Rice Cake and Dumplings ($9.99) has a nice a dedicate flavour. The broth was quite sweet, so season it accordingly.   Service was attentive and our waitress is just so nice and pleasant.   Highly recommended if you want to have good quality authentic Korean Food. BTW, in Korean, they do give you a complimentary bottle of ginseng wine. :)"}
{"text":"We got the chicken ginseng soup, the stone bowl bimbimbap, and the tofu soup. The tofu soup and bimbimbap were decent but kind of bland. The chicken ginseng soup was very bland and wasn't worth the very high cost but I guess people but it for health reasons. I think the soup that came with my bimbimbap tasted better. Still the service was good and so were the little side dishes. Some of the best kimchi I've had!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Thursday, around noon. Wasn't too busy.  One of the best places I've gone to for bibimbap!   Delicious side dishes.   I got the beef and mushroom bibimbap. It came steaming hot and was steaming hot til my last bite. Very tasty and flavourful.  Nice decor, friendly staff.  I would most definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is probably the best restaurant for Korean food that's not in Koreatown.   Ginseng chicken soup- tender, flavourful, delicious Bibimbap- classic, crispy, aromatic  SO MANY SIDE DISHES! I saw a few one-party people who still received as many side dishes as a family of four. They are super smart about allocating the side dishes too- they give you a little bit of each for sampling, and when you ask for more of your favourites, they'll give you more generous amounts.   The best part is that the ingredients  for each dish are visually represented on the wall, so you definitely know every aspect of the dish.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the tofu spicy beef soup. Flavour was great but there were literally few small pieces of beef and are super thin. I will come back to try their other dishes though.  Service was great and staff was really friendly and attentive.  3.5/5"}
{"text":"I ordered the seafood pancake for over 10 bucks. It should called green onion cake as it had 2 small shrimps. Overprice and little portion. Parking is convenient. I would not come back."}
{"text":"I really like this place. They specialize in Korean Samqyetang (ginseng chicken soup), which I love. I wouldn't say that it is the best that I've ever had, but it's pretty good! Other than samquetang, their menu selection is not very big, but I kinda like the fact that I don't have to take too long to look over the menu  It's a pretty small place, so I'd recommend a reservation to secure a spot on weekends."}
{"text":"Had the abalone ginseng chicken soup.  It came out a lot faster than i thought it would!  i read in other comments of wishing for a bigger menu, but if they are specializing, the argument is better quality control on what they make.   there were six side dishes served with the bubbling hot soup.  the chicken had glutinous rice, one piece of fresh ginseng that was full of flavour if you eat it, and one red date.  caution: the date has its seed, you could hurt yourself if you bite down too fast too hard on that date.  there was also one chestnut (peeled of course) as well inside the glutinous rice.  the waitress left a container lined with a plastic bag -- where chicken bones, red date seed, etc can be discarded.  she also added a small dish with noodles to add into the boiling broth. chicken was slide off the bone and the glutinous rice was perfect.  the chestnut seemed a little underdone, but i really enjoyed the soup, some may find it a little bland -- there is salt (might even be sea salt) and black pepper to their soup.  i liked it as it was and finished it to the last drop.  side dishes: cubes of daikon kimchi, salad of lettuce woth red cabbage with this black sesame dressing, sweet soy fried xubes of potato, sweet pickled julienned slivers of daikon and carrot, marinaded fish cake with green pepper  and a cucumber/zucchini marinaded with gochujang and sesame seeds etc.  definitely full with a warm belly from this meal. planning this winter to come again and try other things on the menu.  especially other ginseng soup options!"}
{"text":"Came here after the lunch hour and it was basically me and another two diners. Service was great, waitress was very attentive and friendly.   In terms of food, I ordered the seafood soon tofu and it was okay. What I didn't like about it was that the tofu was cold once you bit into it. Soup was mediocre at best, probably because the other foods were their better known. However, seafood was actually decent, could've been better if they were cooked longer. On the bright side, the side dishes were really good, possibly one of the few places I've been to that had good side dishes. The brown rice was included in the dish, which was nice.  Their black sesame sauce on the salad was a nice change from the usual salads I'm acquainted with.  Overall I wasn't too impressed with what I ordered but it does warrant another visit for their other menu foods."}
