{"text":"We should have known when we walked in to Indian Flavour at dinner time to find it deserted except for one lonely table by the window.  It's just early, we said, sitting down and ordering the buffet.    My water glass is spotted and stained.  My partner finds unidentified substance in his water.  Still, we shoulder on, convinced that we are getting a deal at $13.95 for dinner buffet.    Our hopes for the food were dashed.  Most of the selection at the buffet was uninspired.  Grease and salt were the prime ingredients as every dish was coated with oil and salty beyond belief.  It was so bad that I had to push myself to have a second plate, and didn't even bother to try their rice pudding dessert.    At least I didn't overeat at this buffet.  There are many good Indian buffets in town, and Indian Flavour is certainly not one of them."}
{"text":"Want a lot of food for not a lot of money? Come here! My friend and I were looking for lunch around 2 O'clock and stumbled upon Indian Flavour. It is right in the downtown core and hard to miss with it's huge red, vertical sign. It's a fun looking room with colourful drapes and attentive service for a buffet.   Come lunchtime, the best option is the buffet for 10 dollars and change. For two people, they brought us one naan bread, cut in half which is a bit stingy if you ask me. Anywho, to the buffet! The salad selection is pretty miniscule. I didn't even try anything on it because they looked a bit left out. The onion baji and fried other thing were cold and didn't have the crunchiness that is so welcome in food like this.   I applaud the order of the line-up of food. Apart from dessert towards the beginning, it is a very logical setup for putting together my plate. The food is ok at best. Butter chicken's chicken has hard, unappetizing chunks of fat on the meat with bones and the lamb curry's lamb is also very fatty in an oily sauce. We ordered more naan bread and were not charged. I liked the eggplant dish and the spinach though it could have had a lot more of the advertised cheese. The rest, and we tried a lot more, I don't really remember which is telling. Despite this, we still went for two rounds of food, learning from our mistakes and left feeling very full. Meh."}
{"text":"Well-meaning but understaffed. I got to check out the dinner buffet where one waitress had to take care of all of several tables. The kitchen was having a hard time keeping up with the food supplies. They ran out of Naan pretty frequently but the waitress had us in mind and always saved a few for us. The lamb curry was too slow coming that they just removed it from the buffet selection leaving nothing but chicken. The tandoori chicken was a rare sight too but the butter chicken was decent. As far as dessert goes, the Gulab Jamon was good but the ice cream was too hard to properly scoop, given that they didn't actually have an ice cream scoop. I'd say come only if you need to fix your Indian food craving."}
{"text":"Hindsight is always 20/20, but it doesn't make it less true that Indian Flavour should never have moved out of its heavily trafficked Atrium location to it's dingy current second floor digs a mere block away.   Visiting on a late afternoon (about the same time I always used to frequent when I was at Ryerson), I found the large dining room almost completely empty. The once incredibly pleasant servers were now sitting around a table, discussing something that was more important than greeting me.   Once we established that I was going to forgo the lunch buffet ($9.99) and just have a combo of two curries ($6.99) to go, I was walked over to the buffet spread and dished out my meal. Although there were a fair number of both meat and veg options to choose from, the curries mostly looked inspired. The saag that I chose was rather bland and had only one lonely cube of paneer in it. The butter sauce (sans chicken) was a much better balance of spicy and sweet.   While the server was visibly displeased and inconvenienced by their running out of pre-made naan at the buffet table, it must have been my my lucky day since the freshly prepared naan was definitely worth the wait. Now if business could just go back to booming, perhaps Indian Flavour could manage to churn out consistently quality food again."}
