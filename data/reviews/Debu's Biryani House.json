{"text":"At first glance, Debu's Biryani House looks like any other Indian lunch buffet at Noon. A sampling of vegetarian and meat dishes, some salads, chutneys and other sauces and a few desserts. But looks can be deceiving. Debu Saha is known for being one of the best Indian chefs in town and the fame is well-deserved. This was, quite simply, some of the best Indian food I've tasted (and that includes a month traveling in India).

A few things raise this lunch buffet far above the pack:

1. The dishes are varied and unique, each with their own flavour - unlike many buffets where the dishes all tend to run together. Everything was fresh and clearly made with heart and soul. Vegetarian dishes in particular shone, especially the unusually good Saag Paneer. Sauces were round and rich, but not heavy; flavours perfectly balanced. Spicing and seasoning were surprisingly good.

2. Everything was homemade. Mango and carrot pickles stunningly delicious, Raita both intense and palate-cleaning (a surprising combination), Samosas complex yet light. Even the Naan bread was unusually good - chewy with a crispy bite on the edges.

3. Service was wonderful. My husband and I came with our bouncy (read: destructive, yet cute) 10-month old, who seriously enjoyed the tandoori, but made a huge mess. The servers kindly refilled our water often and were warm and welcoming, even with our loud kiddo (yes, we were THOSE people). 

Basically, this is just the ideal Indian buffet experience. If you have tried Debu's food before, you will not be disappointed. If you are a newbie, prepared to be delighted.

Can I go back now?

{"text":"Food wasn't that great.  Went in with great expectations but was disappointed. The price was high. Nothing wow about it.

Ok food but pretty expensive."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here on a Saturday night.  The place was *dead* quiet; only 1 table of customers.  That set the scene for lower expectations on what was to come ....

The food I got was OK (A fairly plain butter chicken), but nothing special.  I wanted to like this place.  But I doubt I'll be ordering from here again.  In my view, there are far more flavoured tasty dishes at other downtown indian restaurants in Toronto.  For slightly better prices too than this place.

They need to spark up the dishes, and do some serious advertising perhaps, to get more business."}
{"text":"We ate there on Friday night, so so happy Debu is back in town.

We had (an old favorite) veggie pakora basket and the street style fish and chips to start.

Main courses, we had Chicken Tikka - a delicious twist on a UK favorite - Trust Debu to step it up. Lamb Massalam (perfect hint of ginger) and the veggie eggplant dish. Rice scented with rosewater (I believe) and garlic naan.

Now if only the Veal ribs were to be available... hint hint

Can't wait to go back again."}
