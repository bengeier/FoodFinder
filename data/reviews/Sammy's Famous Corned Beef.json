{"text":"Fast service. Good food. I had the \"famous special\" (just its name) with Corned beef & sauerkraut on rye. Nice blend of thousand island & mayo. Two pickle spears & large drink for under $10. One free refill...
Oh yeah, there is an ok bar too"}
{"text":"I had driven by Sammy's countless times when heading into Lawrenceville, and as I crossed over Penn, I would always read the garish neon sign proclaiming the corned beef's fame, and think, \"Isn't the prerequisite to fame being marginally known?\" Because I had never heard of Sammy's, ergo could not verify its fame, particularly when using the following model of logic: 

McDonalds? Famous.
Tom's Diner in NYC? Famous - if only because of Jerry Seinfeld and Suzanne Vega.
Sammys? ...to... ...Pittsburghers...? 

But none of my pals had ever eaten at Sammy's. Sure, they'd driven by and read the signs, but they'd never gotten off their duffs and had a go at this 'famous' corned beef. So I decided to do it myself. 

Here's how it went:

My corned beef sandwich featured (drum roll, please): corned beef (!!!), Swiss cheese, rye bread, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing. I double-checked my notes on corned beef sandwiches I had previously consumed in my lifetime. ALL THE INGREDIENTS WERE THE SAME. So, I asked myself: what makes Sammy's corned beef famous? 

1. It's not the corned beef. I mean, it was good corned beef, but it wasn't life-changing. I certainly wouldn't challenge another deli to a Corned Beef Showdown with Sammy's in my corner.
2. It's not the Swiss cheese. I'm pretty sure that Swiss cheese served in Switzerland would be vastly superior. 
3. Maybe it's the bread. Most rye bread is thin. Sammy's has thick rye bread. And it's soft. Very pleasant.
4. It's not the sauerkraut. My German grandmother whips up a mean sauerkraut, the kind her mom made in the Old Country 50+ years ago. Sammy's isn't anything to sneeze at.
5. It's not the Russian dressing. Can anyone stake a claim in truly superlative Russian dressing? Maybe the Russians. But not Sammy.

It seems that I'm bashing Sammy, but I'm not. I just don't think it was anything special. I enjoyed my sandwich, but I might have enjoyed more the conversation I was having whilst eating the sandwich. 

Maybe, Sammy, you're famous for claiming you're famous. 

That's how Paris Hilton achieved fame, so you're in good company. 

I think."}
{"text":"Crappy, boring, limpid. 

The pastrami tasted bland, the bread was borderline stale and uninteresting, and the whole sandwich was a little wet and lukewarm. Got a Penn Pilsener from the bar, and it had the unmistakable taste of dirty lines - a little sour tang of lactic bacteria. 

How is this place \"famous\"? Is it really? Can anyone please just brine some brisket and hand-slice it?"}
{"text":"Pretty perfect Reuben.  They steam the corned beef which I love.  Perfect proportions of meat, dressing and sauerkraut.  Good pickles.  Very Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Belligerent bartender, dirty dishes and broken glassware. 

Ordering my first (and only) round went smoothly. Conversely, when I noticed my mug had a chip in it, I politely asked for a replacement. The bartender, showing a great deal of condescension, acted as though this was a ridiculous request and illustrated his thoughts by pouting like a petulant child as he poured the beer from my damaged glass into a unclean replacement. 

Ignoring the poor cleanliness of my second mug, as I was sensing some enmity, I continued with what I thought was proper decorum. I spared him the lesson on classical physics yet tried to explain that the glass chip may have fallen inside my beer, therefore, I would like a new draft. I also added that because I had already had a few drinks from my original, it would be perfectly acceptable for him to pour me only half a glass. 

I could see that he was already precariously perched at the precipice of cantankerous conduct and possibly personally offended. Apparently, rational thought before asking for half a beer poured into a new glass (or on which to base any decision) became too much for him to handle. This is what must have sent him plummeting over the edge onto the behavior which I base my review.  

With arduous focus maintaining a prison yard stare, he slammed both mugs into the sink. At the sound of broken glass I reconsidered explaining the basic principles of physics with an augmentation in decision-making to thwart his poor life choices and their repetitive cycles. However the amplified air of hostility and roll of his eyes made me confident that he now understood how we ended up in this conundrum. Explication would be redundant and conceivably harmful. I nonchalantly looked away in an effort to prevent this volatile situation from reaching critical mass. 

My labors to recover the situation were rewarded with a full glass of beer crashed onto the bar where it spilled over the sides to become a half glass of beer with a wet and sticky grip. 

I let it go, after all, I didn't come here with the futile notion of educating a bartender in the suitable customs and cultures of civilized society. If I ever hear anyone mention patronizing this place I'll instead recommend a trip to the great ape exhibit at the Pittsburgh Zoo. From my experience the apes at the zoo exercise a more appropriate demeanor. 

After the way I was treated I'm embarrassed to have spent money here. Fortunately there are a plethora of superior alternatives within walking distance."}
{"text":"The corned beef sandwich was fine. Forgot the coleslaw on the side - check your order if you're getting something to go. The chicken soup was excellent. Service was fast.  The atmosphere of the place is like an old bar/tavern. A good place to go if you want a quick meal to carry out Or you want to hang out with some friends with a beer and a sandwich."}
{"text":"I like a dive restaurant as much as the next person, but this is not my kind of place.  It smelled dirty, the bartender and the lady who took our orders were both very unpleasant, and the food didn't taste fresh.  It just doesn't look clean in there, so that is a major concern.  You can be a bit hole-in-the-wallish, but you still need to keep the place clean.  Our table smelled like a moldy washcloth had been used to wipe it.  Won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"Pastrami sandwich with slaw was very good. Lady making food is not very patient with out of towners like me who are unfamiliar with the menu. Bartender heard my order wrong and poured two beers I didn't really want. \"Oh, sorry\" was the reply. Whatever, we drank them anyway. Good food and beer prices, simple atmosphere. I'd eat/drink here again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for a quick drink or food. Also the two bartenders Bubba and Dj are my two favorites .."}
{"text":"The famous corned beef sandwich on Rye is the way to go!"}
{"text":"The corned beef sandwich is the best. Add a cold brew and you don't need anything else."}
{"text":"A great corned beef sandwich in a bar with plenty of character.  Small place with friendly staff.  Glad I stopped in."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches in the city. It's the most low-key bar in the city. If you want to grab a sandwich and a sixer this is the place."}
{"text":"Today I chose the \"Sandwich Special with your choice of meat topped with Swiss Cheese, Cole Slaw and Russian Dressing - with pastrami\"   The sandwich had no shortage of meat what so ever and was \"good\" but it lacked cole slaw and dressing and only had a little cheese.   All I could taste was the pastrami really.   I have had the corned beef before and its good too but I am more of a pastrami/salami fan.  Next time I will request the dressing and cole slaw on the side and just apply myself."}
{"text":"The corned beef may be famous but the service is awful. I've been here several times and the service was always lacking. Today it was just awful and the three broads behind the counter made sure I'd never be going there again.

The food is pretty good. Nothing spectacular and I'm not sure how famous it is. I've had the corned beef and the roast beef. Both of which the slice fresh for you. The pickles are good and the bread's fresh.

But  the girl's making the sandwiches never smile. They also have small talk the whole time they're making your sandwich with each other. If you are going to be jibberjabbering while making my sandwich, why don't you at least direct it towards me? No one wants to here about how much you hate your job, your bills or how so and so got fired for doing this and that.

Today was the deal-breaker though. I've never tried their pastrami so I ordered a large pastrami with swiss on rye bread with mustard. When I go to the cash register to pay for my sandwich, there's commotion. 

I told the unsmiling old lady what I ordered and the two younger gals start hollering that I ordered a salami sandwich. I say, \"No, I ordered pastrami.\" The one girl says, \"Well, I heard you say salami.\" I shake my head and say, \"I have a soft voice, maybe you misheard me but I wanted pastami. I actually said pastrami twice.\" She says, \"Well you said salami\".

Really?

\"Look, I wanted a sandwich, not an argument.\" I put my money back in my pocket and turn around to leave. They told me I still had to pay for the sandwich. I told them, \"But I didn't order THAT sandwich\" and walked out.

I can forgive alot of things. But, even if I did say salami (which I did not), there's no excuse to start arguing with me about it. I've worked in restaurants. You apologize for not getting their order right and you make them the right sandwich. You put a smile on their face and then talk about how much of an a-hole that moron was when you have a chance with your coworkers.

Oh well...their loss. I won't be back to this place ever again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best corned beef sandwich ever.  I have been a fan of Sammy's for at least 25 years.   It seems like nothing more than a bar, but don't let that fool you.  The corn beef is excellent.  I like the corn beef special on light rye with the coleslaw and Swiss cheese."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for business in June and found this place. Nice place! Kind of a \"shot & a beer\"joint that sells really good corned beef sandwiches from a counter in the back of the place. Corned beef was really good! What makes them famous, I don't know! They were not \"that\" good, but well worth the money!! Check it out, but keep you expectations from getting too high..."}
{"text":"Good food!!!!!!!  free popcorn too. Very yummy and fun! Had a very delicious dinner. Had a good shot of fireball"}
{"text":"If you're famous, why is there never anyone in your restaurant?  Seriously, I live right around the corner, and I've never seen more than one customer in there at a time, and it's completely empty about 3/4 of the time I walk or drive by.  As one other reviewer rightly pointed out, Sammy's seems to be famous for claiming to be famous.

(Note: this is for a visit about ten months earlier - could've sworn I'd already written one.)  I'd been walking/driving past Sammy's for several months after moving into the neighborhood when I decided to finally hoof it over and try one of their \"famous\" corned beef sandwiches.  The sandwich itself was, well, mediocre at best.  There was a decent amount of meat, but it was pretty average.  The other ingredients were also...average - certainly nothing that would generate \"fame\" because of its flavor.  

Service was the usual gruff, put-upon treatment I've come to expect from small businesses in da 'Burgh.  Prices were okay, but no great bargain.  I haven't been back.

Three stars for the sammich, 1.5 for the rest."}
{"text":"I didn't have a drink at the bar, but one look around told me I would love this place as a bar. It's just the kind of dusty , down to earth, sparsely filled  place I like getting my drink on at and I will surely be back to sit at the bar and slow life down for awhile and have a brew.  It should be also  be noted that I have now found a new location to procure 16oz cans!!! 

I stopped in on my half hour lunch break and ordered a roast beef sandwich. 

The roast beef was warmed which I wasn't expecting. For me I like my roast beef served with cheddar cheese...cheddar cheese isn't exotic...but for some reason Sammy's doesn't have cheddar *frown...and I requested brown mustard none of that either. 

So what I got was meat, lettuce and tomato with a large drink the total for my sammich  and drink $8.00.  That makes for an expensive lunch.  Way more then the $4.85 I'm use to spending on my 6in Italian BMT....

I'll be updating this once I see how the bartenders get down...but for now 3 stars the sandwich was way to expensive for what it was. No cheddar no 5 stars."}
{"text":"Well the place looks like another junky Pittsburgh bar, but there is definitely something to check out here. And that would be the \"famous corned beef\" sandwich. It's not an exaggeration. It's good. Not sure why you would end up in downtown Pittsburgh, but if you do and want something tasty, this is a place to check out. Expect a busier crowd when lunchtime hits for all the poor little office workers."}
{"text":"Sammy's is a place with lots of tradition. This is their original location. They know how to make a classic Corned Beef Sandwich and they make it well. 

They pile their sandwiches high, and they are made to order. All the ingredients are fresh. 

Service is fast and courteous. You order in the back, then pickup at the cashier. 

I've been eating hear for more than 20 years, this place is dependably good."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are small and expensive.  Ordered the 'Famous Special $8.99'  Definately not famous or special.
  They say 'New York Style'.  Looks like they haven't been to New York during this century. In New York they are piled high and delicious. Don't believe me?  This place was completely dead during the lunch hour except for a couple old men sitting at the tables...  Eat somewhere else, seems like that's what everyone is doing"}
{"text":"Sammy's is still the best place in Downtown Pittsburgh to get a good corned beef sandwich.  It's still a little dive hole-in-the wall place across the street from Kaufmann's--ahem--Macy's.  Still as popular as ever with the lunch crowds, but a great place to go for an inexpensive lunch."}
{"text":"I never ate here before just drank after work in the old days. So I was in the mood for a pastrami sandwich,  this place is 2 blocks from my work so I went in. The grown up version of bam-bam behind the bar says you can't order food at the bar, go to the back and order. I order a \"hot\" pastrami and swiss on rye, lady asks want anything else on it, I ask do you have brown mustard? She says smartly \"it's the only mustard use \". Ask for a ice tea then pay. Guy says \" it will be a minute while it heats up\". I get my sandwich.  Meat was \"cold\" & dry, cheese not melted. For the $$ the portion was small. The bread was fresh and the pickle was good. Total waste of 10 bucks.  The only good thing from the experience was the cute girl with the tattoos that works there. They claim to be New York style, bullshit. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service was awful!! Michele the manager became frustrated with me while I was placing my order because the restaurant was short staffed!! I could've believe that I was being spoken to with such disrespect when all I wanted to do was place an order.. Never again will I spend my hard earned money here, neither should anyone else.."}
{"text":"The most stunning dive of dives in the city- neon lights and Yuengling at 10AM sharp. And the sandwiches! They're glorious. I may have erred in going for the brisket over the corned beef, but I couldn't have been happier. Paper-thin, moist, and sweet with onions and creamy dressing. The ideal sandwich, truly."}
{"text":"Great, simple bar downtown if you're looking to grab a quick beer and a sandwich after work. Sometimes an overly trendy and over priced bar is just NOT what I'm in the mood for. Sammy's is perfect for those times. The price is right and I love the casual atmosphere to have a few beers and hang out. They have some great beers on tap as well as a good selection of domestic cans and bottles.

According to a lot of my friends, the best tasting and priced Bloody Marys around! (I don't like Bloody Marys, but I trust the judgement of my pals when it comes to cocktails!) You can get many different kinds of sandwiches, although they seem to be known for their corned beef or pastrami. The brisket is really good as well! Sides include macaroni salad, potato salad and cole slaw-- all of which I have eaten and enjoyed.

Bartenders are friendly and it's surely one of the best deals for a meal and some drinks downtown!"}
{"text":"I walked into Sammy's expecting a ny style corned beef sandwich and that is not what you get. I don't think Sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich. Meat was dry under seasoned and Luke warm. The bread was just sliced supermarket bread. I hate to say it but giant eagle makes a better sandwich than this place. Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"Downtown Pittsburgh is deserted at night, especially on this street.  I was asked if I needed help with directions by a well-dressed stranger steps before entering into Sammy's with my suitcase.  That was sweet.

I got off the Amtrak train during the evening and was wandering around the area looking for a quick eat.  Qdoba was closed.  Originally, my plan was to eat here and then head to my hotel but I changed my order into a take-out.  Although only a few seats were occupied, the atmosphere was very heavy and intense.  It was a little too quiet for me.  I felt like I was in a saloon with a fight about to break out any minute.  

I walked to the sandwich counter at the back of the bar and ordered the special.  The woman was friendly although she didn't seem to be up for much conversation.  For less than $10 (~$8?), I got a pastrami sandwich on rye with cole slaw on the beef and a pickle on the side.  Damn, the cole slaw was light and the pastrami was very tender and chewy!  I devoured the whole thing.  Definitely worth a trip to Sammy's for this sandwich!"}
{"text":"Came in and as the other reviews said it's kind of dingy. I really was craving corned beef and have been wanting to try this place for a while. 

The waitstaff is rude. There are no signs of where to order so I asked the bartender and he shoveled me towards the back. 

I found the spot where they make the sandwiches and ordered the corned beef. I asked the next lady I wanted everything on it and to go. They do take credit cards to my surprise. Even Amex haha

I have to say my sandwich is quite delicious. The corned beef is quite good and the bread is soft. It came with a pickle that was huge! For around $6 bucks I really can't complain. I'll call this place a little hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place is a downtown must. Not fancy, by any means. But, that's why I like it. It is a great shot and a beer place and the perfect spot to grab a beer before a Steelers or Buccos game. I love the Roast Beef on Rye. I think they use Breadworks bread. Keep up the great work, guys."}
{"text":"Hard pass on this place in the future. Stopped in here hoping to find some delicious corned beef, just after picking up my daughter a slice of pizza from up the street. Even mentioned that, as I was placing my order. It was only after we payed for my food & our drinks, a guy comes over & says they don't allow other peoples food in their establishment. I honestly thought the guy was joking! He wasn't. I told him that would've been nice to know before purchasing my entree. He said, you should've asked!.. Zero offers of making a to-go order, nada. I had to ask for that! By the time I got my order ready to go it was cold. I definitely feel this was shady business & bad corned beef!! Definitely look elsewhere for a better taste of both."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place and the name holds true. When you first walk in, the place looks old, which can give off a two sided opinion, but then I ate the Corned Beef, which was amazing!  A good quantity of meat and the quality was even better...  I'm from Jersey and it's hard to rival our deli sandwiches back home, but I'd say this place comes as close as possible.  I strongly recommend checking this place out if you are in town for a Steelers game and I plan to visit here again when I come to see the Pirates play."}
{"text":"Located downtown, this corner bar is a great option for a quick lunch or dinner bite, and or beer. 
If you are going for a bite, when you walk in, you will head toward to back of the bar, where you will see the above head ordering signs and sandwich counter. You order the sandwich and pay there. While waiting for your most amazing sandwich, you can now order a drink at the bar (paying there). 
For those of you that have been here before, you know the run down. However, i was a little confused when i first patroned. 
The sandwiches are very very good. The woman that has made my sandwiches, every time i go, is down to earth and pretty patient with me (Thank god)! And the bar tenders are nice as well.  It's a very low key bar and not intimidating. I've eaten there alone and didn't feel weird about it. 
I have been coming here for the last few months, every few weeks, just to get my sammie fix. They are really that good!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna miss this place now that I'm not going to work downtown anymore. The \"Famous Special\" with sauerkraut on marble rye was my favorite. Really really good."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place think's it has famous Corned Beef. I can only believe it's because there are no other deli's downtown.  The restaurant/bar is a dive.  The Corned Beef is nothing great and their side dishes are nothing special.  Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"First time going to sammys and their customers services is horrible. The ladies making my sandwich were impatient and moody. I felt bad that I will never get to try there so called famous roast beef sandwiches but I will not tolerate any type of rasicm. Yes I'm a African american man that lived in Pittsburgh my whole life and I expect great things from my people (all people) from Pittsburgh. Hopefully they can make some  changes in employment which I doubt. This is not a review on the food but how I was treated at this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm a Chicagoan, so I'm not gonna give you the Official Pittsburgh Line that you have to go to Primanti Bros. Yes, P-Bros is an Experience, and my life is greatly improved for having had said experience. But when it comes to the better corn beef on rye, it's Sammy's hands down.

The quality of the ingredients was off the charts good. Even the pickle on the side was unbelievable--and from the same local producer since Sam first opened up shop 31 years ago.

Its exactly what you want in a neighborhood bar, down to the neon signs in the window, the nostalgic mix of old timey black and white regional photos and Penguins and Steelers memorabilia plastered across the walls every 3 inches, and complete with the aloof but still affable owner, counting money and slinging beers behind the bar.

tl;dr: I highly recommend anything that comes with a pickle."}
{"text":"Good quality corned beef sandwich at a good price. However, I asked for my rye toasted and was greeted with \"we don't toast here.\" How do you not toast a corned beef on rye???"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Pittsburgh. Great corn beef sandwich, nice atmosphere, great bartender. Over all, a better vibe than any other downtown bar /grill I visited! The bartender keeps a 2014 Almanac Book of Facts, to settle any dubious claims from any tall tale telling patron."}
{"text":"Sammy's is a Pittsburgh institution that's been around for as long as I can remember and I'd be willing to bet it hasn't changed since its inception. It's got a very casual atmosphere. The food service is almost \"cafeteria style\" meaning you get in line, place your order and by the time you get to the register your sandwich is either wrapped for takeout or in a basket ready to be paid for. You can then seat yourself at either the bar or at one of the tables. It's unique in the fact that it could be classified as either a deli a restaurant or a bar. As a deli you can purchase corned beef and other lunch meats and deli items by the pound. As a restaurant you can get a good sandwich, salad, and/or side for lunch. But then again, it's a full service bar with a few craft beers on tap and you could get a cocktail or beer and also enjoy some grub.

I was in the mood for a quality sandwich today so I stopped in and had the \"Famous Special\" -- a sandwich that sports a generous portion of corned beef with your choice of slaw or kraut (I got the kraut), a slice of Swiss cheese and Russian dressing all between two slices of fresh bread from a local North Side bakery called the Breadworks (I got the marble although I could have chosen rye, wheat, white, Russian rye, a Kaiser roll or an onion roll). A pickle wedge on the side compliments the sandwich nicely. Although there was a line of about ten people in front of me, I don't think it took more than three minutes to get my sandwich. The staff behind the counter don't do much chatting with the customers and its clear efficiency (without being rude) is the rule. 

I had wanted a quality sandwich in and a quality sandwich is what I got. No disappointment at all. I left the place feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"The corned beef and the pastrami sandwiches are tasty. These 2 sammies are all I've ever purchased here. The name of the place screams that this is their specialty, so I go with it. I appreciate the rye and pumpernickel breads that are possible as options--they're light and complementary. Also, I find the sides to be quite good.

Sammy's staff has some earthy characters however this spot kicks out the orders quickly at lunch and the pricing is certainly competitive.

An old style atmosphere is alive and well here. Patrons include a lot of no nonsense types and those who seek throwback food of another era.  

There is a fair amount of seating available and a large bar in the center. It has seen better days in terms of the interior; and the restrooms are a bit scary. 

It's a Pittsburgh institution and perhaps more divey than some would like, but I enjoy Sammy's Famous."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service. 

If you have thick skin, you can definitely eat here. But if you are prone to being offended when someone's rude to you, this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"Friends and I have been coming here and all of the other former Sammy's locations for cheap beer and dry sandwiches, but I will never return. We already closed our tabs and was going to purchase a beer to go when some random man decided to make an unwarranted sexist comment to me about my appearance. It was insulting and uncalled for. I shared the remark with my friend that was coming out of the bathroom who defended me by telling the man to keep his comments to himself and that women don't need to hear what men think about them. The bartender, you know, the famous wrestler or whatever he is, told her to stop and eventually threw us out and \"banned us for life\". I guess it's okay to be insulted by men and women should sit there and silently accept it. As we were walking out the bartender just kept claiming that he \"won\". Congratulations on winning five less customers and a glowing yelp review, sexist asshole. I never thought I'd give a business a one star review, but you're welcome. You earned it."}
{"text":"The idea of people going to restaurants and ordering things that aren't on the menu only to slag them ruthlessly for not having those items is one that has always confused me. I assume these cranks want to dislike particular businesses and have churlish fun doing so. 

Sammy's is nothing more than what it is, and I'm not sure why some diners can't appreciate it for that. If one wants the Big Apple delicatessen experience, one should board a Greyhound, and coincidentally, a bus station is blocks away from this Sammy's satellite. So go. Far. Away. Please. 

At Sammy's, you'll find adequate service, a mixed, civil, quiet clientele, old-fashioned tavern decor, and fine, fine sandwiches served in normal proportions. Are they really \"Famous?\" I don't know, don't care, and hear no one \"raving\" about Sammy's aside from its haughty, eternally malcontented detractors. Sammy's makes sandwiches and serves alcohol, soft drinks, and a few other things. Cope with that. 

Regardless, I still feel that Sammy's makes a fabulously fatty yet fragile and flavorsome corned beef, but they do offer other kinds of sandwiches as well, and for some reason I was feeling like having tuna salad en route to a Symphony X concert at Altar Bar one evening last week, so that was what I treated myself to. 

See, I often crave that chilly, mushy, rich, creamy, slightly crunchy tuna filling between slices of sturdy white bread from time to time, and Sammy's delivered it unto me without fail, building the beast to my specifications (white bread, lettuce, tomato, onion, American cheese, and mayo). And I'd never ordered such a thing from Sammy's before, either. So take a chance for you I did, the Yelp lurker, coming out happily unscathed.

What I have ordered before is their luscious potato salad, and I ordered it again due to its abundance of waxy, yielding spud cubes, tenaciously velvety dressing, and whatever other good, good things comprise it.  

A fat, cold obelisk of dill pickle completed my basket nicely and kept me going for the rest of the long, strident night ahead, so to me, the portion was adequate and destroyed Subway with a bolt of lightning. 

Including a tall cup of Pepsi, my bill came to less than 7 dollars. I left a dollar tip and was thanked by my server who told me to \"holler\" if I needed anything else.

P.S. Over two years ago, I reviewed the corned beef sandwich itself at Sammy's sadly defunct Lawrenceville location...

{"text":"Sammy's is now gone, and in its place is a check-cashing, gold-buying establishment. This is not good at all."}
{"text":"Go have the corned beef. And a good Iron City draft. They're both delicious. It's a great lunch spot in downtown (I assume this is the one I went to; my receipt says 901 Liberty but 9th is very close)."}
{"text":"After years of walking past or driving past Sammy's, and seeing the big neon sign proclaiming 'famous' corned beef, I finally decided to plan to give it a try.  I am a HUGE fan of those ginormous New York Reubens, and have yet to find one that even comes CLOSE in Pittsburgh to living up to its claim.

So after the theater today, we decided to try Sammy's.  From the outside, it has always looked very NY delicatessen, and I expected to find that kind of atmosphere inside.  Man, was I ever mistaken.  

For a place that from the outside boasts fanatically about it's famous corned beef, the interior certainly didn't reflect that.  It's...a bar.  From the outside, the place looks huge.  From the inside, it's 3/4 bar, and a row of tall tables along the windows,  a few regular sized tables, and in this case a 'few' is an accurate count...there was one large round, and two two-tops.

There was no table service, only a sandwich counter at the back.  And basically, all they do is make sandwiches.  They have no real cooking equipment. They have a bunch of metal tins, a fridge for sodas, beer and basic sides like potato salad, and rack after rack of potato chips.

I asked for a Reuben...but they don't MAKE Reubens.   They don't even toast bread, let alone grill it.

I am totally perplexed how a joint raving about their own corned beef via giant glowing neon signs would NOT make THE most famous of all corned beef sandwiches in the world.

The guy behind the counter slapped two sandwiches together...oh...and one other piece of equipment they have...no grill, fryer, or heating unit...but they sure do have a SCALE to make sure your meat portion is exact.  The sandwich was in a little plastic basket with wax paper, and the basket didn't need to be anything else BUT 'little', because as far as I was concerned, it was a perfect match to the sandwich.  The Kosher dill quarter in the basket was more generous than the sandwich.

Their beverage options are all Pepsi products, canned or fountain, or alcohol.  

And, as is typical for the burgh, several TV screens, all playing some sports coverage.  How unique and original.

Now, I'm not saying the corned beef was bad.  It was actually fairly good.  I will NOT go so far as to use the word 'famous' to describe it.  It was adequate.  The price wasn't bad, but quite frankly I would be more impressed paying a few dollars more and getting an actual impressive sandwich.  

For all the glitz on the outside of the restaurant raving about the famous quality of the food, Sammy's really isn't much more than another Pittsburgh beer hall...with a sandwich counter."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks/selection, but the lady making the food was absolutely miserable"}
{"text":"Great prices, casual atmosphere, heavy pour on the cocktails, this place is a downtown staple.  Oh, delicious sandwiches and free popcorn."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the corned beef sandwich.. I figure if you have the words \"Famous Corned Beef\" in you name it better be damn good... This one wasn't at all."}
{"text":"Not sure about others' bad experiences...  On arrival found clearly marked order counter with someone very happy to assist us.  Good conversation as she prepared our sandwiches, quick and to order.  Beer on tap was easy from a just as happy and helpful bartender.  Beer was cold, sandwich was classic corned beef on rye deli made.  I won't hesitate to return if I'm back in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Oh Sammy's...how glad I am to reconnect. I had first sampled the famous about five years ago and hadn't had one since.  Now, that I've moved the office downtown it's convenient for me to visit as much as I'd like.  Ray, Tom and I found ourselves wondering around the city around lunchtime trying to get a lay of the land and find the good lunch spots when we spotted Sammy's... I had almost forgot about this place.  There are a few locations around the city with two downtown (I think?).  The one we went to is close to 6th St. I think.  You walk in and it looks like anyother dumpy yinzer bar with a poke machine to the left next to the cigarette vending.  There is a large bar in the center of the restaurant with plenty of regulars having a lunch beer. It's relatively dark inside and for somereason really muggy, not sure why because it's relatively cool outside.  There also is a few larger tables on the right where we decide to sit.  At first we all sat down thinking that there was a server, there wasn't.  So, we looked a little dumb (not the first time), then we realized that you actually order and pay yourself in the back.  In the back there is a deli counter with large coolers to also purchase beer by the 6 pack (I guess).  I order for Ray and myself.  I get one corned beef on rye with swiss and a side of dark mustard.  I also get another corned beef with cole slaw as the topping for us. Tom gets the corned beef with cole slaw ontop.  I also order a couple orders of macaroni salad and grab a couple of iced teas out of the cooler.  We walk back to the table and I first sample the macaroni salad, not good...not good at all...The flavor is somewhat offputting and there also is something sweet like cinammon in it.  I only have a bite.  Now, the sandwiches are great!  I had a 1/2 of the Corned Beef on rye wiht mustard and it's great!  The bread is fresh, the mustard is cgood quality and the corned beef is delicious piled high packed with flavor.  The other 1/2 I tried with the coleslaw on top is also delicious the coleslaw is creamy and is the perfect topping for the savory corned beef.  I'm glad I re-discovered this place and the next time I'll just get a sandwich to go."}
{"text":"We ended up at Sammy's Famous Corned Beef after trying to get pho at Tram's Kitchen and forgetting it was a Monday (Tram's is closed on Mondays).  The bright neon lights flashing FAMOUS across the street beckoned for us to head over and try it out... so we did.

I ordered the Sammy's Special, which is 5 ounces of corned beef topped with sauerkraut or cole slaw, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing on your choice of rye.  I went with sauerkraut and rye bread.  I also got a side of potato salad b/c it costs a buck and I was kinda worried I'd still be a little hungry after the sandwich.  The sandwich was alright; the corned beef wasn't as salty as I expected and sliced really thin.  I would've liked my bread toasted, the heat of the meat and sauerkraut warmed up the bread from the inside.  Toasted bread might have also held up to the wetness of the sauerkraut and Russian dressing; the bread was extremely soggy by my last bite.

One of my companions said their pastrami was underwhelming and to stick with corned beef (he had two sandwiches).

The potato salad was pretty standard with a dijon mustard base.  

They also have a bar in the dining section of the place, but since it was around 2:30 PM in the afternoon I decided not to get a beer at that time.

Overall I was satisfied with my meal and I'd probably drop by again if I was in the area, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get their sandwich."}
{"text":"Yinz goin dahn to Sammy's for corned beef sammich n'at? The answer to this question should always be yes. Sammy's may not be the nicest bar, but its a very Pittsburgh bar. If you know that is a compliment then this is the place for you. Tender meat on local bread is not a good enough discription. I love Sammy's, its a pick me up after a hard day. The meat, cheese, and bread sorta meld together to become a smooth buttery burst of flavor.  I suggest \"the special half and half Pittsburgh style with everything on marble rye and a potatoe salad\" half corned beef half pastrami  with thousand island dressing \"pittsburgh style\" means with Cole slaw on top comes with a pickle . The potatoe salad is nothing special but it completes the meal. The beer is cheap with an ipa on tap for 3.50 so drinking suggested. The only suggestion I have is get some Turners tea up in this place!"}
