{"text":"Loved the food had a lot of take outs all taste great but a little on the expensive side"}
{"text":"After such positive previous reviews, we decided to give Spice 4 U a try and we weren't disappointed. A large well lit restaurant, with a number of different sized tables and an area with comfortable sofas to wait for your takeaways. Both the restaurant and the takeaway service were fairly busy for a Sunday evening, which is always a good sign. After negotiating a copious menu with many new dishes we finally plumped for a Karahi Shashlik and a saag chicken main, opting to skip the starters, which in hindsight was a good idea, the portions are huge!    Our meal had a solid start, poppadoms came with a variety of sides - mango chutney, lime pickle etc. The mains came out in Tandoor bowls, and the accompanying rice and naan/paratha - all of which to say they were generously portioned would be an understatement. There was probably enough food for three/four people, never mind two! All very tasty and we vainly battled to try and finish it all, but to no avail!    The prices were very reasonable even for specials at around the Â£6-10 mark, and a well stocked bar too, with Cobra on draft - a great meal."}
{"text":"We love this place. The menu is not your standard Indian menu: it has lots of interesting and unusual dishes featured prominently, and then tucked away in a corner are the usual Tikkas, Biryanis and Baltis, as if the owners are saying You can have these if you really want but why not branch out for once?. Once you've stepped out of your comfort zone, you're treated to some original and very tasty Indian cuisine. The service is friendly and efficient and the prices represent good value. Although we've only ever had takeaways the decor of the main restaurant looks perfectly acceptable. All in all, an excellent little place: highly recommended."}
