{"text":"We frequent Killian's quite often. Always great food, great people, and a great time. On a side note, they no longer accept credit cards, but there is an ATM machine on site (for a fee, obviously)."}
{"text":"Great burgers grilled on a wood fire.  Flavorful steaks and specials every night. It's one of my favorite local restaurants.  They use locally baked bread and buns along with freshly ground beef from a market in New Kensington.  Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"We got the NY Strip Steak Sandwich. Smashed Potatoes. They were great. One of us got the Chicken Salad. Wow was it big."}
{"text":"Greasy tabletop and greasy food.  A \"pub\" with no drafts?  Waited for an hour for our meals before asking for a box to take them home when they came.  Then both my husband and I became very ill after we ate the food."}
{"text":"Went again to Killians it's one of our favorite spots to go . We usually get the burgers which are out of this world and massive . Well tonight I got the ribs and OMG .. so juicy and trader fell right off the bone . My son got the beef nachos . I got the home fries with my ribs . The servings are huge and the service is great . We love mom and pop type places ."}
{"text":"Expensive grill food. Not very well seasoned. Only thing I really liked was the boiled red skins. No drafts, just bottles. Slow servers!!! Expensive kids meals that aren't kid friendly. I could do better at home with a 10$ budget..... one of those other places uppity snoods get drinks at so they price inflate mediocre food. Has unique fire wood taste but no more worthy then campfire food. Lol. Ill pass on the 60$ bill and slow service."}
{"text":"Incredible. In credible. Only reason this restaurant isn't 5 stars with lines out the door every night of the week is location and ambience. It's divey, but you won't find better food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is great the owners were very friendly and nice. The food is very good the prices are good. The portion sizes are outrageous. The selection of beer is okay. Only issue is if it is cash only no credit cards or debit cards they do have gift cards"}
{"text":"We went to Killian's for ribs. I usually do not eat ribs because you do not get much meat, but these ribs were soon meaty.  We got a salad to split, which was delicious, a rack of ribs with great BBQ sauce and a LARGE bowl of buttery boiled red smashed potatoes.  The price was $24 but it fed us for three meals.  There was so much food and it was really good.  The only bad thing about it is that each time we go back, we probably will order the ribs and not try the other stuff they have on the menu.  My mouth still watering when I think how they fell off the bone.  We will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Went to this place for dinner based on some of the previous reviews. Was first off put by the location. A crummy dirty bar in a pretty run down area. First walking in I probably should have left. You could see into the offices and kitchen which were both a mess. And this young boy kept going in and out of the kitchen with an apron on. I still wonder if he was the head chef (kidding, but strange). They only take cash. And the bar had no taps. A \"pub\" with no drafts?   It took about 30 minutes to get our soup and salad, which tasted fine. After over an hour, I saw our food sitting at the window. The waitress walked by it 3 times while it got cold. Then another waitress delivered it to another table at the other side of the bar. After it sat at their table for 15 minutes, they tried to give it to us saying \"no one touched it\". Health violations much?  I canceled our order, paid, and left.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"This is by far the best food in the Valley. The Grilled Chicken Salad is the best that I ever had. Everything is excellent (so others have told me) but I still gravitate back to the salad. Steak salad is just as good. Be careful, no credit cards, cash only so plan ahead! Great service, great place."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in East Deer!  All grilled burgers and meat - cant beat it!  Nothing like it!"}
