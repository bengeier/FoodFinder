{"text":"Food is okay but wait time kills you and I do mean it. Just be ready to get treaed as if you are getting food for free and it's just a favour from them.
I waited for almost 1 hour to get my Thali.  When I spoke to owner, he replied it's just been 20-25 min and I m new to his place. Which is not right. We also ordered dry Chicken and I did specifically said I need mild in taste for my 5 year old kid but when he tasted chicken , tears rolled out of his eyes and when mentioned this to server she said this is our mild and they Never bother to change and make it more mild.
I would rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait 15 minutes if your ordering take out .... And that's a good thing ! Everything is cooked fresh to order . 

And it is well worth the wait . They just renovated too and it looks upscale . If only the location was more in a plaza type setting I think they would be more well known in Yelp ? 

Want Indian in Brampton ? Try this place !"}
{"text":"Go for authentic Punjabi food, nothing else. The thali is bang on - both vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian. Fish curry as well as tandoori chicken are amazing."}
{"text":"Second time coming here this year. I would say it is the same quality maintained. Very simple ambience, no change in the style of order decor. If you are looking for good food but have time to wait for them to cook and serve, this is the place. No food do they they have ready to serve. Tried the chicken curry with Tava Roti, which was just perfectly cooked and delicious."}
{"text":"Like many other men before me, and despite lessons learned from dates gone wrong in the past, I give the guy who ditched me at Twin Fish a second chance to redeem himself. (if you want more deets, please read my Twin Fish Review). 
June 11, 2015. The man date has been set for 130pm at The Taste of Punjab.  Punjabi Cuisine?? Heck yea!!!
Chips B is punctual as usual. 
Enter restaurant. 
First Impressions, Nice interior decor. Looks newly renovated and clean.
The place had approx 10 customers in wait. Fast service. Expect ten to fifteen mins. 
No man date in site. 
135pm, no man date in site. 
140pm, no man date in site. Damn I wish this place had a Liq Lic. Lol. 
145pm,, \"Hey Benny, how are you doing?\".  Omg he actually showed. (Quick reminder to all Yelpers out there who don't know the background behind this man on man meeting. And by man on man I mean,,,,,,, let keep it clean perverts!!!!). This is a platonic meeting of two men to discuss a potential business op while having lunch,,, that is all!! 
Lol. 
It turns out that my my date has a rapport with the ownership of the establishment. Good. Introductions are made, hands are shaken and our order is placed. Order:  Two Veg Samosas, Veg Biriyani, Fish Curry (hot)  and one Karahi Paneer (mild). Now if you take a close look at my pics, you will see that the entrees are not overly soaked in Ghee/Clarified Butter. I think of that as a positive aspect as I am turned off by a thick layer of ghee on my Indjain noms. 
Verdict:  To start I had two Veg Samosas with Chutney and Sweet sauce.  The Samosas were done right. Drained of oil properly. The filling had a perfect balance of potato, spice to veg mix. Combine it with the two sauces and wow wee.  Flavour explosion. I loved it. I ate both of the Samosas myself.  Oink Oink.  The Karahi Paneer:  a mix of veg, Indian cottage cheese, spices with the flava flave of Karahi. Combine this dish with the Roti/toris and bam!  Should have got hot.  Lovely dish. I ate every last piece. The Veg Biriyani was unlike any other I have ever tried. Keep in mind that I have never tried Punjabi Style Biriyani.  This was the an excellent accompaniment to the Karahi and Fish Curry. Yum yum yum. Now to the Curry Fish. The gravy was perfect. Not too ghee'yee. Lol. Just right. My only boohoo was the amount of fish in the dish. I wish there was more but I can honestly say that the chef saved me from an intense cardio workout.  Now to sum it all up, this was my first visit. I must now conduct recon missions to check for consistency. Lol. Oh believe me I will. For now I give a three star rating with a tentative yum, nom nom, yum verdict. I must dig deeper into this cozy, clean and delicious resto to finalize my ratings. Yelpers, try this place out, tell me what you think. Stephanie S, get yer butt over there and give it a spin and tell me what your taste buds say. Lol. 
Peace out Yelpers."}
{"text":"Just go out for a regular meal. If you looking for a good restaurant to dine-in and have a luxury dinner, this is not for you.

The food is good and yummy. I have tried out shahi paneer, and butter chicken most of the times and it has never disappointed me.Ensure, to call in 20 mins before you reach, to avoid waiting. The lunch time is usually very busy."}
{"text":"Went here last night with three friends .  The place looked nice and had some decent reviews.

Sat down. Ordered some curry, biryani, naan, chicken marsala.  And even ordered an off menu item (chicken pakoras).  They said that would take about 25 minutes but we said \"yes\" to it anyways.

25 minutes later our chicken pakoras arrived (the off menu item) they were decent but I can't fathom why it took 25 minutes for these to be made.  Essentially they were deep fried chicken nuggets.

Shortly after finishing the pakoras (which didn't take very long with 4 very hungry people) I noticed 3 other diners that had sat down AFTER us had FINISHED their dinners of what looked to be some curry with naan.

After about an hour after sitting down, I got up to ask the man behind the cash register when our food would be ready.  He promptly disappeared into the back before I could ask and we waited a few minutes before leaving some cash for the pakoras and exiting the restaurant to seek dinner elsewhere.

1 star for decent pakoras (and I've had much better)."}
{"text":"Definitely more than a 3.5, FOR SURE!  Taste of Punjab came highly recommended by a friend and I finally got a chance to try it out.

It is just North of the Airport, in an industrial area, so keep that in mind when you head out.  There's nothing really in this area, unless you're attending the Hindu Temple OR an event at the banquet hall next-door.

I ordered the Goat Biryani (you can choose level of spice, ~$13) and Butter Chicken ($10) was recommended by server who said that it's completely different than other places that makes this dish sweet.  It definitely was not sweet, but more on the tart side and spicier!  Biryani was \"wetter\" than Hyderabadi-style biryani. Both dishes were really tasty and there were leftovers of both dishes.

Server was lovely.  Atmosphere was a bit quiet for a Monday evening, but a few pick-ups and diners.  Pretty chill place, as opposed to hectic.

Other than the industrial location, the only thing that I'd take note of is that food came 15-20mins after ordering.  I believe that everything is made to order hence the wait time, so do not come here a hungry, hungry hippo!"}
{"text":"Small mostly take out restaurant with some seating. The food at this restaurant is amazing especially if you like your food spicy. The prices are also reasonable given the quality of food. I ordered the vegetarian biryani and butter chicken medium spice and it was excellent. Possibly one of the best butter chicken dishes I've had. The mango lassi here isn't bad either at 2.99. The service could be faster but it's worth the wait. Overall I would recommend this restaurant and will be coming here myself again."}
