{"text":"THEY ARE OUT OF BUSINESS and HAVE BEEN for quite awhile! It was fun in the early years though, still have a mug from the club!"}
{"text":"CHEERS in Cleveland. Fucking awesome! Neon Parma sign. Soulless hanging out with pints in hand. BIG/CHEAP beers. Weirdo Parma girls. Greesy food.  This is not doing the 'Saw justice but I'm drunk as I write and I am wishing it was because I just had five talls of Amber Bock while watching Monday Night Raw with Aaron.  I have NEVER had a bad night here. Even the most normal, average sessions end with good conversation or good fried food. Call me a retard but I suggest anyone wishing to move away from Cleveland  should spend a few nights here first ,and then, reevalute."}
{"text":"I hate that they are closed. Their Original Saloon Burger was the best I've ever had in my life. Was a great bar."}
{"text":"It's Parma at it's most \"Parma-ish...\"  THE UP-SIDE:  Decent bar food (slightly high on grease!) and a good corner bar vibe.    THE DOWN-SIDE:  The decor used to be fun (back when it was decorated in the early-eighties) but has since become old, dusty and weathered looking.  What once was shabby-chic, is now just shabby.  THE SUM-IT-UP: Not a bad little corner bar.  It's been around forever, so it's worth a visit.  Expect some grease to your food."}
{"text":"I'm from Detroit, and the Jigsaw is one of my favorite Cleveland spots. I've been there mostly in the capacity of a booking agent for bands, and I have to say the staff is top-notch! The sound is great, too (although the bands aren't always as great). The back smoking patio is a nice touch. You can smoke if you want to, but your clothes don't smell like smoke from being inside -- what a concept! (Detroit still allows indoor smoking)  The food in the restaurant is really tasty, but the atmosphere there sucks. Last time I was there it WAS REALLY REALLY LOUD and took a really long time to get waited on, but once we got a server she was a doll."}
{"text":"Use to be a great little bar to get a drink and a cheeseburger in but this location is now closed."}
