{"text":"I kept walking passed this place and I had been wanting to try the 7 meat fondue thing for a while so I eventually went. It was pretty decent but quite pricey I think.  Their pho and bun were pretty standard, nothing wrong with them. I think I may have to go again to try other stuff."}
{"text":"Broth is simple and super salty.

It just comes off as lazy. Broth is par, the meat is overcooked and not rare when you order.

The service is actually pretty good.

Try harder don't be lazy. Plz. Thnx."}
{"text":"Discovered this place a few weeks when hubby was in the hospital across the road and I couldn't handle any more food-court grub. I've been five times now (3 takeout and 2 eat-in). 

Place is clean and staff are mostly super friendly. Rare beef pho is tasty and comes with all the fixings you expect but a bit cheap on the protein. The grilled pork and beef are delish, with steamed rice, veg and salad with the standard Vietnamese fish sauce that is yummy. Spring rolls are on the smaller side but fantastic-not too greasy and really crisp. The only dish we didn't like was the pad-Thai that hubby was craving-go to a Thai resto for that. They have a decent selection of beer and some wine but I don't know how extensive as I never want wine with Vietnamese food! They also offer free delivery within a 5k radius but be warned they are SUPER strict about this and won't deliver to me (6.1 K according to them) despite me offering to pay them extra! Beware takeout pho-the container doesn't come close to being large enough to hold all the add-ins so only order if you're taking it home to eat out of your own big bowls-otherwise super messy. Yum!"}
{"text":"Simple yet elegantly presented Vietnamese cuisine. Clean and fresh flavours, even something as cheap and simple as wonton soup is presented with pride and artistry.
As a professional cook for over 10 years I always enjoy the extra effort put into plating and presentation, it shows respect for the guest, and pride in your craft.

Very happy with this local gem."}
{"text":"Food here is tasty and the service is always great. Definitely worth trying out if you're in the mood for Vietnamese and in that part of the area. Their spring rolls are yummy and we love their soup noodles and fried rice dishes. Very clean and spacious too"}
{"text":"Very clean, and modern. Not your average mom and pop style shop. It's a big place, divided into two blocks of space.

Took a look at the whole menu, prices are standard Vietname resto prices. Small pho is around $6.50, two appetizer rolls are $3.95. Very affordable. Also read that they deliver for free for orders over $25 (within 5km).

I ordered Vermicelli with chicken for $7.50. It wasn't anything to knock my socks off (it's vermicelli, nothing you can really do to make it out-of-this-world), but it was tasty and fresh. Their portions are not so generous as some other places, but it was enough to fill me. I didn't come out feeling very full, but just right. Overall, a satisfying dinner was $10, including tax and generous tip. 

Unlike most privately-owned Vietnamese restaurants, place is very clean, spacious and modern, and service was great, while prices were only market price and food was good. A rare combination...I want to give five stars, but only after I try their pho! Will update :)"}
{"text":"This was my go-to pho spot when I lived around the Bathurst and Dundas area and it's always my go-to whenever I find myself in the area. The service is consistently amazing (most polite and courteous service I've ever seen at a pho restaurant in Toronto), the restaurant is extremely clean and their pho hits the spot every time. I love heat and spiciness so I usually like to have a good amount of siracha with my pho, but the broth here is so savoury and flavourful on its own that I have it by itself. I always get their spring rolls which are really crispy."}
{"text":"I order take out from Pho Tien consistently for several reasons. 

I'm a huge fan of pho with rare beef and tripe so that is always the dish I order when I try a new Vietnamese restaurant. And wow was I impressed! The broth is almost unrivalled in the City. Super tasty and you can tell they don't water it down. Excellent pho at this place. 

The second time I ordered delivery I asked for no peanuts on top of my spring rolls since I'm allergic. I was sad when our order came and there were little bits of peanut on top of the spring rolls. We called the restaurant and they apologized profusely and promptly returned with a brand new order of spring rolls (peanut-free!)! Wow, another gold star!

They definitely recognize me when I call as they pre-empt me by saying, \"no peanut, right?\".  How about that for customer service!

The prices are right and the food us tasty. Very high quality to price ratio, folks."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and never seen this restaurant busy during any evenings,  so hard to imagine the place is still surviving.  I'm guessing the majority of their business is from the lunch crowd because of the proximity to the hospital across the street,  the funeral home next door, and the medical clinic around the corner. 

I've dined here many years ago and had the pho dac biet (special beef noodle soup with rare beef, beef balls, tripe, tendon, and brisket) which was pretty decent and reasonably priced. Somehow one cannot go wrong with a standard Vietnamese pho dish.

I haven't been to Pho Tien since the renovations until recently and was pleasantly surprised to see how the interior was nice and clean with new furnishings (I was actually in awe as it definitely looked fine),  but the clear stench of bleach was overwhelming and made me a little uncomfortable. 

The walls were stark white with minimal decorations throughout the restaurant and reminded me of a hospital setting except for the nice dark wood furnishings.  Plus it's not your typical Vietnamese pho establishment because there were no containers of cutlery or napkins or sauces on the table, they did advertise as fine Vietnamese cuisine and tables were only set upon seating. 

I was quite bothered by the smell of bleach (at least we knew it was hygienic), but the fact we were hungry and wanted to try the 7 beef courses make your own rolls we stayed. 

The 7 beef course special was $25 for two people which seemed like a great price, but the server informed us the side dishes were on the small side, so we ordered an extra  beef fondue and the bo la lat (grilled beef wrapped in tropical leaves).

That being said the beef special for two wasn't quite that special after all since it wasn't filling for two people. The extra beef fondue priced at $13.95 seemed a bit high and the extra order of bo la lat at $8 was not worth the price at all.  I wouldn't mind paying extra if it was tasty, but it was definitely not worth $1.30 for each little roll.

Almost all the beef dishes were on the salty side with the exception of the beef fondue because it was raw beef slices that you dip in the sour soup.  Definitely not the special 7 beef courses for two I was expecting. 
Plus if you wanted extra lettuce, bean sprouts, mint, basil, vermicelli,  and pickled vegetables for the wraps it was an extra $4.50. Most places will provide these items for free or just charge an extra $2-$3 at the most. Extra rice paper for $2.50.

Am giving Pho Tien one star for convenient location and second star for friendly and quick service which was not too difficult when there were only two tables to serve that evening. 

I may go back to try their pho, but the rest of menu items seemed a little pricey for portions being served. If this is considered fine Vietnamese cuisine,  I can do without the fine. It may probably be a better idea to go a few blocks east and find an authentic Vietnamese pho place in Chinatown."}
{"text":"This place kept me cheerful as I supported a friend with a life-threatening illness in the hospital across the street.  On my first break from his bedside, I checked out the fare in the hospital food court and concluded they were in cahoots with a bunch of cardiologists looking for new patients.  I ran for the old Kim Bo and found the new Pho Tien.  This is classic delicious healthful Vietnamese food with dishes from all the main styles.  Ingredients are fresh.  Service is fast, pleasant and helpful without hovering.  Prices are reasonable.  I'm almost hoping my friend gets sick again!"}
{"text":"Un restaurant vietnamien situé près de Dundas sur Bathurst avec deux salles adjacentes très éclairées, un personnel accueillant et un menu très riche en plats savoureux et authentiques."}
{"text":"Casual and clean Vietnamese restaurant tucked away on Bathurst St. (north of Dundas). 

The veggie spring rolls were very good. They were filled with mushrooms and other veggies in a very crispy, light and bubbly wrapper. The rolls were a good size and were flavourful before adding any dipping sauce. 

The stir-fried tofu with lemongrass and onions on vermicelli was good. The lemongrass flavour wasn't as pronounced as I hoped it would be. I couldn't use the house dressing so I had to make my own with hoisin and hot sauce. And while the dish was advertised as tofu with onions, I found there were too many onions and not enough tofu. I would recommend adding some extra veggies to this dish. 

The hot Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk was a nice way to end the meal. 

Overall, I will be back for Vietnamese food that is good and affordable."}
{"text":"Beef seven ways!  I've wanted to try this and I'm so happy I did!  

I've been really into making my own fresh rolls at home recently and it's actually quite fun.  With the sliced beef, beef balls, beef rolls, etc... you can make your own variations at the restaurant with lettuce, bean sprouts, cucumbers, pickled carrots and daikon, mint, and basil.

I would order this again.  This is a fun DIY meal.  :)

Don't forget to wash your hands!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday this week. The meal was interesting

.Started with some deep fried beef balls (hardy har) which were decent and then opted for something unusual, the Banh Xeo (Vietnamese sizzling cakes with shrimp and pork, served with lettuce, mint and pickle).  The best way to describe the dish is as a Vietnamese Crepe (good ole Indo-China influence). The crepe itself had a nice almond like taste and good texture and the filling was quite good, 
The lettuce came on the side and I had it as more of a salad with some fish sauce, but the Vietnamese lady at the table across from me wrapped the crepe in the lettuce to eat it. I'll try that next time.   

Im keen to come back and also to try the 7 Dish Course special for 25 dollars!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! My favourite pho so far in the city. They also do delivery which is so wonderful. The staff are always very friendly and very accommodating. If you don't see something on the menu, you should definitely ask because chances are they have exactly what you want and are willing to make it special for you!"}
{"text":"This was my first time dining in this newly renovated space as I've basically grown up eating here when it used to go by 'Kim Bo.'  Our family always orders the classic '7 beef dishes' special.  Delectable as always!  Very good portions and I always appreciate getting to sample the 7 different styles.  We're always SO full that we pack the beef congee and beef cubes with celery, carrots and onions to bring home...another meal in itself!  Service is always quick and friendly.  Nice to see that the restaurant makeover only enhanced the dining experience and nothing was compromised as a result.  Will definitely continue to patronize this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here again and tried more dishes. Unfortunately, the yumminess isn't consistent across the menu. 

The yummy:
Pork sausage
Fried spring roll
Fried wontons

The not yummy:
Shrimp rolls in rice paper (didn't taste that fresh, and the dipping sauce tasted mostly of oyster sauce)
Pho (bland)

We also ordered the bo 7 mon for two ppl which was $25. It was pretty neat to get beef cooked 7 ways. The congee was meh. The make-your-own rolls was good. There was a meatball thing that was good too. For the price, I'd say it's a pretty good deal!"}
{"text":"I frequently order delivery from this resturant when I am craving a good bowl of pho. Although they are located in little Italy, they have quite a large vicinity on their delivery zone. You must order over 25$ before tax for it to be free delivery though.

Some favourite orders are their pho special and their pho with tripe and rare beef. Portion of meats are fair and when it is delivered the soup is still quite pipping hot! The portions are a little smaller so if youre hungry a large is usually equivalent to a medium in delivery. The vermicelli bowls are however a little small and lacks the pickled veggie and noodles. The meat in these bowls are also quite thin. 

For apps we like to get the spring roll, shrimp rice paper roll and the deep fried wonton.  These are done to perfection and still crispy by the time it's delivered.

The delivery guy is super friendly and also comes right on time always! Never had an issue with their service and quite enjoy going to them because of their reliability.  Too bad they're not on ubereats or foodora!"}
{"text":"I believe that the old restaurant (called Kim Bo) has been given new life under the name of Pho Tien, and I came in here looking for a quick lunch, the fact that it said \"fine vietnamese dining\" made me hesitate for a second since I wasn't sure if this meant dishes would be a more expensive than I was willing to pay, but I decided to risk it and walked in. Thankfully menu prices were similar to other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. Which makes me wonder if the clean and non shabby-ness of the restaurant is why they deem it to be \"fine dining\"? 
This was a rare occasion when I didn't decide to go for pho dish, I went with a fried rice instead, it was definitely well portioned for a hungry stomach, although I had to bath it in chilli, hot and soy sauce to bring out some sort of spring to the meal. It did leave me wishing I went with a pho dish instead (as most restaurants have, you get to choose between 3 sizes on how you want your pho). So while I will give Pho Tien a shot once again, I won't go out of my way to enjoy a lunch here. 
Service was friendly, although there was only one server for the whole place and while it was quiet to start off with, it got busy at the height of rush hour hampering the efficiency of service just a bit, but nothing I would really concern myself over.

Overall a solid solution to lunch if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly impressive and delicious! This was where I went when I snuck out of the Toronto Western Hospital across the street after 2 weeks of hospital food. My illness had made eating a huge challenge. 
Their barbecued pork vermicelli with spring roll was so delicious - make that SO delicious!! - and I ate more during that visit than I had been able to consume in days. So tender.  So flavourful.  So delicately prepared. Shockingly good. 
I returned many times as I recovered and since, and it's been perfect every single time. Literally it's Vietnamese food nirvana to me. 
The young waitress was all alone during my first visit and she was working maybe  six tables plus the bar plus she had to package and serve take out orders. I have never seen a waiter or waitress move faster and more efficiently. She was like totally a blur in her running shoes. It was crazy.  And she did not miss a beat. So impressive. And she was still sweet and sunny and lovely. Wow.
(They weren't understaffed in subsequent visits btw). 
Seriously delicious and so unexpected. Highly recommended! Go go go!"}
{"text":"No clue what all the positive reviews are about. Avoid like the plague! I ordered the singapore noodles with mystery meats, the beef curry and grilled beef on rice for delivery on Uber eats. The food quality was so poor I questioned whether I should take the risk eating it. The scarce meat there was looked passed its expiry date and looked like processed low quality meat shredded or sliced thinly to disguise the fact. It was scaly, shiny, slimy, dry and grey! Food inspection alert! Pay attention to other reviews that also complain of food quality problems at this place - I sure wish I did before I ordered. 

I completely lost my appetite after a couple of bites. The curry and the grilled beef were completely flavourless, the rice and bokchoy was mushy and over cooked. Would give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"That's exactly the pho I'm expecting!!! Shrimp rice roll is tasty and fresh, especially with sauce. They offer four kinds of sauce!! As an East Asian, I will say this is exactly fresh and natural Asian taste, catering to those who are not a big fan of oily food. Beef in the pho is wonderful. I will definitely come another time. Food is beyond expectation, especially considering the low price."}
{"text":"I generally order from this place and it is pretty decent but had a horrible experience today. I was ordering 4 dishes and asked to get one container of hot sauce for each dish. The person at delivery told me I am only allowed to get one small container for all four dishes because it is one delivery! She then goes on
 to say if you ordered four pizzas would they give you 4 dipping sauces and I responded YES!!! Again I said to her if I was eating at the restaurant the hot sauce would be free and even though it is one delivery I am ordering four dishes for four people and we can't share one tiny sauce. Somehow this logic escapes her. I then ask to speak to a manager and was told no, I asked to speak to owner and was told no.  She basically gave up a $40 order because she didn't want to give us hot sauce!!! Horrible customer service and I will now never order from here again."}
{"text":"Pho Tien is my go-to take-out restaurant. I have ordered the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (Vermicelli with grilled pork and spring roll) and it's always delicious. The meat is flavourful and the serving size is excellent for the price. The cha gio is not the best I've ever had - it could be bigger - but does the trick. I recently also tried the mango shake which hardly tasted like mango at all! The only disappointment I've had from this place."}
{"text":"I normally don't care much for good service, but this was unacceptable. It's one thing to have to go up to the front to pay, but it's another thing when the servers throw out half a plate of food while I'm am still up at desk asking for a take-out box. That is utterly disrespectful, and the servers made no attempts at apologizing for their error. 

In terms of the food, I ordered the rice noodles with beef and vegetables. There was barely any beef and noodles. Just a whole bunch of bean sprouts with barely any taste. Would highly recommend to avoid."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since it changed to Kim Bo, and was excited to try to recreate my old memories of the bo 7 mon menu. Our 1st/7 dish was the raw beef fondue, then next came 3 types of beef rolls (bo la lot + beef wrapped onions + bo nuong roll), then came the ground beef ball (cha dum), beef congee, and shaking beef. Overall, everything was tasty except for the beef congee (way too bland) and the shaking beef had a lot of burnt marks. The entire combo was $28.95 for a two person portion. Overall, Pho Tien didn't leave any super memorable impression, so unless I was desperate for food in the area. There are much better options."}
{"text":"Amazing service and very AUTHENTIC food! 
Banh hoi thit nuong and mam nem are on point, which is not something I can say about the other restaurants here in Toronto"}
{"text":"This is the high end Vietnamese place in Toronto.  The food is good, but not that much better than some of the other better Viet places around.  

The place itself is a level above other vietnamese restaurants.  It has clean, white decorum with good furniture and looks upscale.  The prices are normal, though.

Me and my buddy had the Large Special Pho (with tendon and tripe as it should be!!!) for $9.50 and it was a decent size, not overly big.

Also the rice paper rolls with shrimp and pork are definitely worth $3.50."}
{"text":"Pho Tien is a tasty option for Vietnamese food near Toronto Western Hospital.

Service is better than most, if not all Vietnamese places I have tried.

Friends who have been here multiple times say save the pad Thai for a Thai restaurant and skip the chicken dishes.

Otherwise, the vermicelli dish I had was delicious. My fellow diners also raved about the shrimp spring rolls, fried wontons and wonton soup."}
{"text":"We were here on a holiday Monday where nothing much was open. We had to grab some takeout as we were in a rush and this was the only place open.

We ordered:
- beef noodle soup
- grilled pork chop rice
- grilled port vermicelli 

The food was ok, nothing exciting and kind of bland."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

This is probably one of the few places where I will have to disagree with many of the Yelp elites.

I decided to try Pho Tien because the reviews made it seem like it's a great place, and I didn't want to go too far west of Yonge. We were seated immediately at around 9pm on a Friday, and were served tea afterwards as well.

I ordered the crab meat and shrimps with udon noodle in thick soup, while my friend ordered the rare beef and brisket noodle soup. The translation for my order was banh canh cua tom, which means I expected they would use the vietnamese udon. Unfortunately they used the regular cheap udon you can get at your local Asian grocery store. The broth was also extremely oily and did not have the \"thick\" texture I expected. My friend's noodle soup lacked pieces of beef, and he found the broth to be on the bland side.

We also ordered iced lemonade, however the waitress forgot our order initially. They fixed it up and we got our iced lemonades, and I found it to be good, but nothing spectacular.

Service, however, was excellent, and the employees did apologize to us for our missed iced lemonade order. However, the poor food quality did not make up for it, and I will likely not return here."}
{"text":"Love this place. The Pho is wonderful with all the selection and variety that you want we were a party of about 10 and all of us loved our food."}
{"text":"So far I've been here most days after work. I have the rare beef and tendon pho and spring rolls. Their spring rolls are soooooo tasty! It motivates me to work, whenever I plan to come here for lunch. The broth is a little perfumey... Almost like incense! But I actually love the flavour so I'm not complaining :D"}
{"text":"Their menu items are expensive. Two beef pho (medium and large) plus a side of spring rolls cost 28 dollars. The beef balls were cut in half to save expenses from their end and there were way more noodles than meat. 

Overall disappointed with this place. I could get better pho in Chinatown."}
{"text":"We recently moved into this neighbourhood from Chinatown, just down the road. I've been eating pho in Chinatown for years but never tried this place, so I was excited to give it a go. I went in for takeout and found the place full of Asian families, good sign. I was pretty pleased overall - service was super friendly, and the broth was flavourful and not too salty. My only complaint is the portion size. I ordered a medium, which in most pho places would fill me up and then some, but nope. There was a big container of broth, but only a handful of noodles and a really paltry amount of meat - I actually wondered if they had given me the small size by mistake. Portions are very small compared to most other pho places. The medium here is about the same size or even smaller than the small bowl at Pho Hung, but it costs 50 cents more. I'll try it again because its convenient and the service was so friendly, but the kitchen really needs to be less stingy with the meat and noodles."}
{"text":"Great place. Friendly staff. No small side phone but they do have medium and larges. Their rice dishes are good as well. Got the rice with pork chop and a large pho. Wish they put more beef in the soup as well but I'm not complaining. I ate there two days in a row so far. Vietnamese ice coffee was great! Not too sweet, not too bitter. Loved it"}
{"text":"I go to many Pho restaurants. Very clean, very good portions and quick service. Only negative, no chilly sauce - only
Sriracha. I'd come again."}
{"text":"Pho Tien is the kind of place that 's been around forever, that you've passed a thousand times and wondered how they stayed in business. 

It's located across the street from Toronto Western Hospital and down the block from a funeral home, so maybe the place survives by feeding lunch to the 'Before' and 'After' crowd. 

This makes sense, since Pho Tien has a kind of limbo-esque quality to it; a Vietnamese restaurant where the only competition includes lonely McDonalds and Tim Hortons outputs, and a cafeteria so miserable it makes the food served to patients seem palatable. 

Pastel walls and white-painted fixtures seem at odds with dark fake-wood tables and office-grade chairs. A quick google search suggests that a murder may have allegedly occurred here some time ago. 

The food itself is pretty standard Toronto Viet Noms. Pho arrives with a standard tangle of rare beef and beef balls. The soup itself tastes more of salt than anything, but on a cold day it's plenty good. Spring rolls are much better; properly crisp and porky, a welcome contrast. 

Service is rude, but when you're visiting a sick relative, what kind of mood are you in? 

Whether or not Pho Tien is a portal to the next world, it reminds one that there's always comfort to be had in good food."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 4 star right now, but it's really close to a 5 ...It's only getting a 4 because it was my first time here, after a few more visits I'm sure I will feel comfortable giving 5.

I was in charge of picking a place for a group of five to go get Pho on a Saturday night. We have one very picky eater and germaphobe in the group so picking a suitable place can be a challenge. I picked Pho Tien because other reviewers had said it had just had a renovation and was clean ...true that was and bonus the staff are very friendly.

Everyone in our group had an app and a pho, and I can say all were very happy with what we had. We only had a small problem with one of the apps and that was the spring rolls. They were a little greasy but I think that was just maybe a small mistake in the kitchen as nothing else was greasy ...we were willing to let it go. Ironically, it was the order of the picky eater ...go figure.

The menu is large and I'm sure almost everyone can find something they will like. This place is great for large groups as they have some very big tables. The prices are great and right on par with what you would expect from this type of restaurant. Over all we are very happy with this place and everyone said they would come back ...can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"I have always drive past this place but never got a chance to try it out until I read the favorable reviews here. The location is rather odd which is across the street from the hospital and next door to a funeral home -- far away from the other Pho places.
The place was extremely clean (even their bathrooms) and recently renovated. There was only a couple other diners there I went for lunch on a weekend, which is nice as it felt peaceful and didn't have the hurried service like other Vietnamese places. I enjoyed reading my weekend newspaper, but not for long as the food came really quickly.

Being a germaphobe and a stickler for cleanliness, I am happy to see the waitor bring out the chopsticks and cutlery, rather than having a stand of them at the table like other Vietnamese restaurants -- those really freak me out.

The service was very friendly and polite and the food was great, I had the House Special Bun (vermicelli with BBQ pork, shrimp and spring rolls). I really liked their iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk, nice and strong!
On another visit I had their pho, which was reasonably priced (I found that a lot of Vietnamese places have increased their prices to almost on par with Ramen restaurants so it's no longer as cheap a meal as it used to be), satisfying with a very nicely flavoured broth soup.

Going there for lunch on a Sunday is great because street parking is free until 1pm and street parking on Bathurst just south of Dundas is readily available.

After some recent disasterous experiences at other Vietnamese restaurants, this has been my new regular place for my Pho and noodles."}
{"text":"Came here with a big group to try their 7-course Beef meal (Bò 7 món) we also ordered some additional appetizers too. My favourite dishes were:
-Bánh xèo (menu #D01): Vietnamese coconut milk & tumeric crepe containing shrimp, pork, and pickled veggies that you eat with lettuce & mint.
-Gi ngó sen tôm (A12): Lotus rootlet salad with shrimp and prawn chips
-From the 7-course Beef meal, you were given a bowl of warm water for you to soak the rice paper in. Once softened you can add your choice of fillings from the large platter (lettuce, bean sprouts pickled carrots, vermicelli noodles, cucumbers, & basil). Then you add in a piece of beef (whether it's cooking the raw beef in the small stove of soup, using the beef sausage, or betel leaf wrapped beef). Then you can choose to dip it in hoisin sauce (brown & thick), regular fish sauce (clear yellow-ish), or if you're brave... the fermented fish sauce (cloudy light brown). I also really enjoyed the jumbo beef ball, but the Sautéed cube beef with carrots & celery was too oily.

Overall, I really liked making my own salad rolls and customizing the flavours. This was the first time I've tried other Vietnamese food besides Pho & Banh mi and I'm so happy I did!"}
