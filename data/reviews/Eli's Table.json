{"text":"So, I don't know why this is labeled under \"Happy Valley Fast Food Restaurant\", but the sign on the front says \"Xtreme Taste.\"   Got to be the best deal in the area. A take out shop run by two very nice ladies who make yummy cheap food.  My favorite is the sea bass plate. For $6, a plate filled with a nice slab of tender sea bass, a skewer of shrimp, a few pieces of tender calamari, rice, and 2-3 types of salad. It's enough for 2 meals really, though I always end up eating the whole thing. Often the line will be out the door (it's a very small place) but the line moves quickly.  The veggie plate is $5 and plate full of salad and a veggie patty. You can also get a small or large salad tray for cheap."}
{"text":"I decided to pay a visit due to the stellar reviews.  I was so disappointed after my visit.  I walked in at around 2pm.  The lady at the front was bitter and sour,  and I felt extremely unwelcome.  I had to squint at the menu on the wall because it was practically gone (menu is written in chalk). I felt rushed even though I was the only customer at the moment. I decided to go with the chicken and beef. I chose three salads, and most of the options were empty so I went with what was left. While the lady was scooping my food,  she started coughing and would openly cough to the side while holding the spoon...so her mouth was not covered. When finished scooping the food, she moved to the cash register and waited without saying a word. I expected at least \"5 dollars\" but she just stood there waiting. The chicken is a tiny piece and rather dry,  and the beef is not tasty.  But it is 5 dollars.  While sitting on the chairs by the window, she was coughing and blowing her nose. Not a great experience and very unsanitary practises . I don't know how this place managed to get such great reviews."}
{"text":"For $5 you can't beat this place for lunch. Well worth the wait and plenty of options"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and beef Kabob plate which included  rice and two salads, I  chose the grains salad, and chickpea salad. The quality of the chicken and beef Kabobs were good though the chicken was a little over done.  Both the grains salad and the chickpea salad were very good.  The most impressive thing about this place is the awesome value for your money.  For $5.00 tax included... you get a very good quality meal including meat, rice, and two salads that really fills you up."}
{"text":"This place is a classic. $5 for a ton of food. You really couldn't ask for anything more for 5 bucks.   If you've never been for lunch, check it out. Yorkville is normally so expensive but this place is a gem. Only gripe is that the kitchen doesn't appear to be the cleanest. Staff is friendly though."}
{"text":"Unbeatable price and good salads. Unhealthy unchangeable deep fried veggie option and rude service.  I asked if I could switch the deep fried veggie ball for some extra sallad,  the lady roled eyes and muttered something along the Iines of \"oh my God it is three salads for five dollars,  no substitutions\"."}
{"text":"Tried the sea bass combo.... sea bass, shrimp, calamari w/ rice, greek salad and a bunch of beans... $6  It tastes so good.  Get the hot sauce on the fish."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the reviews for this restaurant on Yelp have mislead me.  Xtreme Taste left an extremely bad taste in my mouth.  I visited the restaurant on a Tuesday an hour after the afternoon rush (around 2pm) and was glad to see that there was no line up.  I proceeded to order the sea bass combo and the woman dishing out the food wearily told me that there was no more shrimp or calamari left, however she would substitute with a generous helping of tuna. Since the only other option was beef (which I don't eat) i agreed to the substitution.  At a glance the food looks amazing, I chose as a salad the chickpeas and Greek salad, and the fish was covered in hot sauce. There was also a generous helping of rice that finished off the meal.  Since the restaurant frankly looks dirty and there was no seating, I found a local park bench to \"enjoy\" my meal.  I haven't been so disappointed, especially given my level of expectation after reading the positive reviews on yelp.  The only flavour that I could taste was salt! The food was bland, salty and not at all worth the $6-$7 that I had to pay. The sea bass had absolutely no flavour, even though it was covered in hot sauce. The tuna was okay, I've had better at home. The salads did not impress me either.  I will not be visiting this hole in the wall again. I would rather take my money to another restaurant with similar prices, and better food."}
{"text":"It's worth every dollar! Great price and large healthy portions of good taste. They also have variety of options. The only downside would be that the food is not necessarily fresh and warm all the time. I like the salads as well."}
{"text":"This is a great joint for a cheap and filling $5 lunch. While there can be a line, the service is efficient. However, get there earlier since they do run out of the popular salads. Eat in is non-existent so be prepared to grab & go."}
{"text":"Like Eat a Pita next door, this Yorkville eatery boasts fresh ingredients and low prices at a spectacular location. The home-cooked feel of the restaurant is evident in every menu item. My favourite is the vegetarian place, which is about $5. The choice of salads I recommend is the Greek salad and the tabouleh. The portion is enough for a reasonable lunch but is not as filling as some of the other menu items.  Like almost every other location i have reviewed lately, I find the seating availability here to be dismal. A barely extant counter that seats 2 does not make for comfortable luncheons. Since I am a diner who never orders take-away, I wish they had much more room so I can sit down and enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"Seeing all these good reviews, i went today. The store is closed and moved up north."}
{"text":"Yelp wins again. Led me to one of the most obscure, hole-in-the-wall joints for an amazing meal. This is honestly the BEST restaurant/take-out place for its price in Toronto.  I tried the vegetarian combo the first time - wasn't really a fan of the giant falafel ball thing, but the sea bass combo... WINNER. Ultimate winner of all time. Where else are you going to score sea bass, 5 lil guys of shrimp on a skewer, calamari with rice, and two salads of your choice for SIX DOLLAHS?! Nowhere, I tell you, nowhere.  Honestly, the biggest downside is that they are only open during business hours... so I feel very bad for the regular 9-5ers who don't work in this area who will never be able to try this gift that XT offers the Yorkville population of Toronto.  Oh and they are not getting 5 stars for service. But just put that stuff in your mouth and you know it won't matter anymore."}
{"text":"Price is definitely the selling point here.  I had the $6 sea bass combo, with rice and 2 salads. The sea bass was small (can't expect much for $6), and too salty.  Great choice of salads, there is several to pick from.   For $6, can't really complain!"}
{"text":"I honestly get take out from here several times a week. HANDS DOWN the best choice in the neighbourhood.  I like to joke that it is called the chicken and salad place with an \"Xtreme\" lineup. Give yourself 20 minutes regardless of when you go.   My go to is 2 pieces of chicken with tahini and hot sauce with three salads. Generally I go for chickpea, fatoush and spinach. This comes to $5 even. Served by Xtremely efficient ladies.   Favourite place for takeout in the 'hood. Note, there is nowhere to sit."}
{"text":"$5 for an unreal veal wrap and a couple salad sides. It's all clearly homemade and you should do yourself a favor and skip the franchises to come here.  I'm glad places like this exist.  Cash only,  and there's very minimal seating. Grab and go style"}
{"text":"Best healthy lunch around for the price. 5* I reccomend the vegiatrian plate with 3 salads - $5 tax incl."}
{"text":"Great value, very easy on the wallet for the frequent lunch goer. I always get the veggie with rice and two salads. Sometimes I get the chicken.  Food almost always taste fresh and has healthy options. My favorite place for food in this area. The food isn't always made by the cooks there as some are commercially prepared foods (e.g. spinach phyllo pastry and coleslaw).  The best part is consistency, food is always what you expect. Its not the best, but the variety, price point, healthy options, and consistency are the reasons why I've been here over fifty times this year.  Arrive before noon or come after 1 pm to avoid the 15-20mins wait.  Ladies work fast there so be prepared to know your order, menu is the chalkboard, don't bother with the pictures on the windows.  My only concern is that sometimes certain people seem to get more chicken than others, anyone else experience this? I consistently only get one or two pieced, while some folks are served three or four pieces...what's the deal!? It grinds my gears a bit, I feel like that Capuchin monkey that didn't get the grapes...unfair. Oh well I hardly order the chicken anyways."}
{"text":"Ok, Happy Valley Fast Food Restaurant is barely the name of this establishment. It is \"Xtreme Taste\"... with the rest in tiny writing. Let me say, extreme taste is what you get. I've heard this place is owned by the good folks of Eat A Pita next door so immediately, I trust this place.   Come lunchtime during the week there is a line up outside the door! This might have deterred me if I was going for the first time. But since it was 12:30, my second time going, I knew what I was waiting for. It's worth wait, hey, it's not even a long wait! Stop complaining. Those two ladies know how to get the goods out quickly.   The secret is out. A happy, healthy, huge meal for five dollars flat. One dollar for pop or a bottle of water. Unheard of these days! I ordered the chicken and beef kebabs with rice and salad. The options range from every fish in the water to Italian classic- either coming as a sandwich with salad or with rice and salad. But the whole salad thing is a lie. It's not just salad, it`s your choice of three from an entire delicious salad bar! I personally go for the fattoush, chickpea and grain salad. The turnover is very high so whatever you get, it`s going to be fresh and tasty.   Now for the meat itself, they will ask if you want tahini and spicy sauce on it. Say yes! Trust me, the juices seep into the rice underneath and it's divine. My only complaint is that my chicken and beef could have been a bit/a lot more tender. My hypothesis is that the problem lies within the warming system after the meat is cooked. For only getting a plastic fork, something needs to be done so it falls apart with more ease. It's a shame because even with that, the tastes are still xtreme!   For just five dollars you can eat xtemely well for about two days, though I usually scarf the whole thing down in one sitting."}
{"text":"Insanely good, homemade masterpieces. I've lived in Middle East and this place does it right."}
{"text":":(   This used to be my favourite cheap eats in the neighbourhood. For real, 5 dollars a meal that nice and big was stellar...  Until last week I walked in, first thing I see a little mouse coming from the kitchen...:s  I do not know what to think. I even helped to catch the little tenant.  :("}
{"text":"Still the best lunch place in the area. Fresh, tasty, good quality food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"like everyone says....great food for $5. get there at 11:30 and there isn't much of a line. 15 minutes later and its down the sidewalk (but still fast). good quality. good quantity. $5. amazing."}
{"text":"It's a rare and beautiful thing when you can buy a healthy, tasty, and filling lunch on the cheaps. But wait - this place is also... vegetarian friendly?! Xtreme Taste, you have done the impossible.  There are a multitude of tasty meaty plates also for a similar price, but my favourite is the vegetarian plate, which gets you a veggie pattie/ball, a spinach phyllo pastry, and 3 sides (various salads and/or lentil rice).  At just $5(?!) this is the best vegetarian lunch (nutrition + satisfaction + value wise) I can find in all of downtown Toronto. I will be back whenever possible."}
{"text":"Xtreme Taste!! This place is buzzing during lunch hours - line ups were all the way down the street.  The place isn't big to begin with (maybe 3-4 seats along the window) but it was impressive the way attracts customers.    Everything was basically $5 except for the Sea Bass combo which was $6.  I order the Kebob combo - you get chicken and beef kebob and 2 salads.  You get to choose from a wide variety of salads.  The Sea Bass combo looked good too as my friend got it - It comes with rice, calamari rings, shrimps and 2 salads of your choice."}
{"text":"The best lunch spot, such good value for what they put on the plate. Doesn't look nice, but for a hole int the wall lunch grab on your way to and from somewhere or if you don't have much time it's great. Who cares if it looks like it's straight out of Lebanon, they do it properly and that's what counts. Great chicken/rice, go with that over the other meats. 4 stars instead of 5 because it can be busy as fuhh if you go between noon and 1."}
{"text":"Swung by at around 11:15am for an early lunch and got the sea bass with rice and 2 salads.  They took the rice out of  a weird white tub but it was still hot and delicious.  They didn't give me too much rice or fish, but gave me lots of salad.  The food tasted great and as everyone commented, the salads were very very lemony/vinegary but super fresh!  I don't think the fish is seabass, rather it's probably dory, a less expensive fish.  In any case, It was a great deal for $6 including tax (cash only).  I can't wait to come back tomorrow!  Tip:  I always ask for hummus on the side which they provide at no additional cost"}
{"text":"Went after lunch peak hours, ordered a lunch special with chicken rice and salad. Not much selection for the sides and the food is cold."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing value for the location. I can;t think of another place around here where you can have fulfilling decent lunch for 5$. Now for the food it is above average for sure. You get a choice of 2 salads for the Chicken sandwich I ordered. I picked the potato and bulgur. The salads were OK and I am not big on Salads anyway so you might appreciate them more. Main was a nice chunk of grilled breast pieces I doubled up on the hot sauce and hummus so it was flavorful as well. I would not recommend sitting and eating here as the place is quite tiny and heavily cluttered. Food is quite good and once you factor in the value I can see why there are lineups around lunch time 4 Stars."}
{"text":"A solid lunch, with vegetarian options that were big on flavour.  Fast service the line was moving quite fast. I ordered the veggie lunch plate- I got two salads, a spanakopita and a side for $5. It was pretty awesome.   Yum yum. I would come by next time to try the meat options"}
{"text":"I came here to grab lunch on my day off after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. It's a very popular lunch take out spot; there was a constant stream of customers coming in even though it was not yet \"peak\" lunch hour. I was there around 11:30 am. The main draw, I believe, is the great prices offered because tax is included in the price listed. I got a large piece of sea bass + 2 big squid rings on rice with 2 salads for $6 flat. Easily could have been $10 or more at any other downtown lunch spot. The portion size was decent for what you pay. I felt the food was reasonably healthy as nothing was fried or heavy on grease.  It's mainly a takeout spot though. There was a small counter for eating in -- half of which was taken up with boxes of canned tomatoes so there was only really room for 1 person to sit down.  Service is slightly brutal. The staff didn't bother to greet me despite it being a tiny hole-in-the-wall."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at this place about 3 years ago because it's amazing value, the food they serve up is delish, and it's pretty healthy (or can be, depending on what you order). I am back in the area so I thought I'd drop in. It was like walking into a time warp... same staff, same menu and SAME PRICES! Absolutely nothing has changed, and thank goodness. Everything on the menu is $5 or $6 (tax included), with choices of abot 10 different salads. My favourite is the veggie plate (I'm not vegetarian, it's just scrummy), which comes with a veggie patty, spanakopita, and 2-3 salads. I usually get the chickpea salad, and whatever else I'm in the mood for that day. The lines at the door can get a little crazy, so it's best to either get there a little bit early, or after the lunch hour rush."}
{"text":"I was treated for lunch here and I do agree that although it might not the best food you will ever have, it is definitely one of the best lunches you will have that day. ;-)  Had the sea bass combo and it was quite enjoyable and for the price you pay (although in my case is was zilch) it is definitely worth making this place a staple. It is inexpensive, healthy and you have choices of salads which can really change the overall flavour/vibe of the lunch.   I had the potato salad, again tasty although the pasta salad was a non-starter. Like a kick-starter without the funds: It sounded good but it failed to go anywhere, although still more than edible.   The bass and calamari were delicious and very well made, along with the colourful spices and sauces and shrimp. When I worked downtown, I ended up going to food cafeterias and paid more than this for lesser quality food, especially in the health and taste department but what can you do? I had no choice but if you work around here... YOU DO!   Besides the company, what made this place great is this... Xtreme Taste is not a restaurant, it is pretty much a take-out joint, you get in the --sometimes  long line-up, you order your main, pick your salads, and go to a nearby park (there is one just north of Cumberland) where you can have your lunch on a nice bench surrounded by a soothing shade, comfortable breeze, and bright green trees... like a boss.  Don't judge this place like a restaurant, 'cause it is not. They are purveyors of inexpensive, healthy, tasty food for about half the price you would pay if you went to an average and nearby seat down joint. Personally, I would like to have my lunch outside if I have a choice, so it worked out great for us.   Definitely, a place I will go back again."}
{"text":"GODLY! What a hidden gem. Thank you Yelp for bringing me here.   I had the most delicious and filling $5 meal I've ever had in my life. I'm not sure how they make money! I had the souvlaki combo, which came which one piece of chicken and one piece of beef, along with rice and a choice of 2 salads (I got the mixed greens one and the bean salad). Holy hell, was it ever a lot of food! Not to mention incredibly flavourful.   I can't wait to go back here. This is a must-try."}
{"text":"I wish my mom cooked this good... Thanks a lot mom, you ruined my life!!! 5/5, def. going again"}
{"text":"$6 for a nice healthy and yummy lunch!? Yes please! It's hard to come by places like this which are affordable yet yummy and healthy these days. Say goodbye to pricey financial district lunches in this area!  Tip: When the server asks if you want hot sauce, ask for hummus at the same time and you get it for free. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for lunch everyday for the last 3 years. Their fatouche salad is quite popular but might be too sour for some. Healthy, cheap lunches - how can you go wrong with that? Besides, it's only $5. Only thing is the line can get really long past 12pm especially during summer times. Be ready to have to wait in line at times."}
{"text":"This is a great joint if you want decent/healthy food and want to cut down on your lunch budget. There are quite a few options and from what I've tasted so far, the sea bass combo (with rice,2 salads, calamari rings, shrimps) is the best. The line ups usually extend out the door and a line up in frigid temperatures says enough about the popularity of the place. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Still loving it, seafood combo and salad for $6 taxes in.....10x better than McDonalds...yep loving it...or $5 for non seafood platter...so cheap.. Loving it"}
{"text":"Best deal for lunch in Yorkville by a mile! 5 dollars (say whaaat?!!) for more salad, chicken, rice than you could possibly eat. The veggie special is really great too!"}
{"text":"The most value-for-money (VFM) meal from this place, IMHO, is the sea bass, grilled calamari combo with the option to have either rice & 2 salads or 3 salads for $6 (tax-in). Avoid long line-ups by getting there 10-15 minutes before noon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is mediocre at best. Let me set the scene when you walk in: low ceilings, peeling brown wallpaper, an indefinable bad small wafting through the air, a glass fridge with vats of indescribable food items, and a microwave constantly on the go.   The food wasn't awful, it was just completely uninteresting. The one positive aspect of Xtreme Taste is the price. It is dirt cheap. For 5$ you get a mountain of food.   I ordered chicken and salad for $5. Let's break down my dish:  1. Spinach and onion salad: very vinegary, simple ingredients, uninteresting sauce. 2. Bulgur salad: best of everything I tried, but still, tasteless, oily, uninteresting. 3. Coleslaw: way too vinegar-y, bland 4. Chicken: overcooked & dry.   Overall, I don't recommend this place. It looks dirty and is very boring. Great for a cheap lunch if you're desperate and broke."}
{"text":"So I've always wondered about this place. There is constantly lines out the door and down the street and I couldn't help but want to be part of the crowd last week when walking by.  After about 5 minutes of waiting in line I managed to make it into the inside of the building. The promise of cheap food that pleases the masses kept me in line because otherwise this place isn't much to look at.  I chose the Veal Parmesan sandwich (which is actually a pita based wrap), and 2 salads comprising of a spinach salad and a cabbage based coleslaw equivalent.  For an even $5, I couldn't help but be impressed. Had I paid more for it, I probably would have questions the quality of the veal cutlet which did have a couple weird stringy bites. But for $5, and with the salads being perfectly pleasing - I'm already planning for my next return to try the chicken breast sandwich (wrap) for the next time I'm looking to do lunch on the cheap in the Yorkville area."}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to go here often for lunch with conworkers when I was working on bloor/yonge.  It's a quick bite to eat type of restaurant for takeout.  Make sure to go a bit earlier because the lunch line up forms quick and they run out of food. I don't think they have dinner service.  Food: 4/5, great for vegetarians who want a lot of options. I usually went for the three vegetable plate or the veal sandwich with salad.  Service: 3/5, nice ladies and just typical service  Ambience: 2/5, not much here, it's very tight and small sqfoot of people in queue.  Price: 5/5, it's like $7-ish person for a great selection of Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"This $5 lunch can't be beat! Don't let the long line outside scare you, because the staff move through people quickly.  The place is now called Extreme Taste, FYI.   For such a small place, and a small budget, it's surprising how many options there are. My usual order is the chicken kabobs and salads - beet, fatoush, spinach, greek, potato, macaroni, and more, they have a lot of salad choices! A friend swears by the veggie patties, and another loves the chicken sandwich with side salad. ALL of these are only $5! It's an incredible deal for an overpriced neighborhood. Hence the line. The salads are generous portions and involve fresh veggies and are usually quite tasty.  If you go a little bit before 12, you may beat the lunch rush. I have found 1PM to be the busiest time, with the longest line. It usually takes no longer than 10 minutes, and it's worth it.  Strictly take-out. This place is tiny."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in town! Super friendly service, fresh and tasty food, HUGE portions, and reasonable price. Chicken was so juicy and flavourful. Their garlic sauce is out of the world. It might be too strong for most people but I loved it. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. The place is spacious so you can dine in too."}
{"text":"Everything was reviewed right! Food tasty, light, acidic, generous and loved getting THREE sides with the chicken breast. Pasta, wheat, and cabbage salad were ALL good. I was thinking that I can't believe I'm eating a larger and better quality meal for much cheaper than Mac D! Yes all for ONLY $5 til CLOSE. But they're closed at 5 PM. If you get the calamari lunch, it's $6 and was recommended by the ladies but be there at 11:30 am. Only thing is the chicken a bit tough."}
{"text":"After about two years, their sea bass combo has stopped giving out the calamari. They do have a bit too much vinegar in their salads (maybe that is to your taste, but not for mine). I like the portion of the sea bass and they still give some shrimp, but even that seems to be dropping in quantity.   The other pieces have remained the same in quality.  edit: they took out the shrimp, now they have calamari."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch pretty much every day. For $5, I get chicken and beef kabobs, rice, and three salads. I usually opt for the Greek or the spinach or the pasta or the macaroni or the broccoli and cauliflower . . . and always the hummus. I'm not as big of a fan of the fatoush salad, though it's not bad either. I usually don't opt for the fish, which can get a little rubbery if you get there too late.  I've been delaying reviewing Xtreme Taste because the line-up is already long. I try to go at 11:30 to beat the rush and am usually still the fifth person in line. The ladies behind the counter are wonderful and always have my plate ready to go by the time I hit the salad counter. Can't beat it for $5 anywhere in the city."}
{"text":"Pretty good... I had the chicken breast, apple salad, grain salad and mixed veggie salad. They have multiple selections in terms of salads, standard proteins, chicken, veal, roast beef.  I think they have salmon too.  The standard protein-three salad combo, is $5 after tax.. which can't be beat... There was a short line, but I waited like 5 minutes, so it's a non-issue.  Just enough to check my emails.  $5 after tax for a well rounded, healthy, good portioned meal.  I had to give it a 5... I will be coming here all the time.  I'll visit the pricier places in the area as a special treat to myself... :)"}
{"text":"Great value for real food. This is probably one of the cheapest meals you're going to find in the area and you won't feel guilty for eating it. The owners are nice and friendly. Cash only if I'm not mistaken. I frequently purchase the chicken + choice of 3 salads for $5. If I'm extra hungry that day, throw in an extra $2 for double the protein."}
{"text":"The $5 meal deal is excellent and the food is fresh. Don't let the store front fool you, it's a great location for healthy eats at a great price.   4.25/5 *"}
{"text":"Xtreme Taste (of Yorkville) has moved to Vaughan and has been renamed Eli's Table.  The funny thing was that I was wandering around Yorkville recently and saw the 'only-inexpensive-meal-in-Yorkville' joint had closed and listed some address far up north.  Fast forward a few days and I'm in Vaughan Mills area and looking at Yelp for a place to grab dinner and 'Xtreme Taste' came up as a nearby hit.  However, I drove around the plaza for a bit before we realized the there was no 'Xtreme Taste'... but it was the opening day for another restaurant called 'Eli's Table' at the same address (next door to Maple Jewellers for all you Seiko fans) and they were running a no-tax promotion for their first month in business.  We were hungry - so we didn't question it.  The proprietor was extremely friendly and eager to please.  I decided to order the shawarma chicken plate ($13) and the lady ordered a vegetarian plate for ($11).  The menu was completely different than 'Xtreme Taste' and the two famous ladies weren't there.  Also, this was location was quite spacious with plenty of seating for after you order at the counter -- so I wasn't sure if I was being catfished.  But he explained that the ladies at 'Xtreme Taste' are family and this is his operation now.  This made me think of the Ship of Theseus -- if a  ship has had all of its components replaced over the course of a long voyage -- is it fundamentally the same ship?  In this case -- if a restaurant changes its operators, menu, location and branding -- is it the same restaurant?  While I was musing over this in my head - the was basically loading up huge plates of food for both of us - after fresh frying some falafel, he mounded up with rice, potatoes, our choice of 2 salads and our choices of sauces.  Portion size was huge for the price.  He recommended that I try the garlic sauce on the chicken and proclaimed that it was authentic, homemade and not often offered at other restaurants -- I couldn't fight an endorsement like that.  Beyond just being good value - both plates were extremely fresh and tasted great -- the proprietor really takes pride in his craft and it showed.  The only criticism is that thing can be slow.  They are freshly opened and it's a one-man operation so it was a bit of a wait to for us to settle up as he was busy making someone else's order (dude was peeling sweet potatoes after someone else came it and order fried sweet potatoes).  That said, I'm sure efficiency will improve and it's a small trade-off for fresh food.  So, in short: tasty, good value and friendly owner.  I'm not sure if this is the 'same ship' -- it's no longer a spot with a goofy name for the $5 assembly-line downtown lunch with curt service.  That said, even with the different price point - still a great bang for buck for fresh and relatively healthy meal."}
{"text":"Very cheap, very quick, quite delicious. I got the beef + chicken platter I believe and I thought the meat was okay but the real thing that made it for me were the delicious lentils and chickpeas that I picked out as side dishes. I wasn't sure if I'd like them, but they looked good and I decided to just give them a go. Absolutely delicious. I just wish I would have gotten the \"veggie patty\" platter. Perhaps if I would have done that this place would be upgraded to a 4. They looked particularly scrumptious. If I lived in Toronto, I could see myself going here on occasion."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by co-workers and for a summer, I probably ate 75% of my out-of-office lunches here. The value can't be beat and if you're choosey, you can put together quite a healthy combo as well."}
{"text":"I work in this area and Xtreme Taste is probably one of my favourite places to pick up lunch. I order the same thing almost every time - chicken on a bed of rice and for my 2 side salads I pick the chickpea salad and the cracked wheat bean salad. It's tasty food with a homemade feel, healthy and the cost is really the selling point (you get a large portion of food for $5). Yorkville tends to be a health-oriented area and food can get a bit pricey if you're looking for something that isn't fast food and fried. That's why I love this place, and it's my go-to for an affordable bite!"}
{"text":"$5. $5! When was the last time you were able to find a decent, healthy, filling $5 lunch anywhere in Toronto, let alone right in Yorkville?   You know you're in a good spot, when everyone ordering has been there before. \"The chicken for you today?\" \"The usual for me.\"  I had the veggie lunch. It came with falafel on a bed of rice with two salad sides. I chose the broccoli thanks to a reviewer here and then the spinach salad. Both of which were packed with flavour. I want to make that broccoli side at home. Vinegary, spicy and garlicy. So many good 'y's.   The only downside is they nuked my falafel to heat it up. But most items are ready-made and when it comes to a cheap, healthy lunch, there isn't a better spot in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This is the best and cheapest place in downtown Toronto to grab a quick bite. The food is healthy and there is a lot of variety because you can mix things around. For example, one day, you might get chicken with rice and salad and the next day a kebab wrapped in some pita bread.   Also worth mentioning that the salads are very tasty and not your basic caesar salad type of salad. Have fun with the options available and do not forget to ask for hummus, tahini, garlic sauce and hot sauce as they put it only by request!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place. The sea bass combo has never failed me and there's so many salad/sides to choose from, it's hard to get tired of it. Staff are nice- despite the rush of people, they keep their cool.   The lines get long at 12pm, best to get there 10-15 minutes early, especially if you like beets - those go out fast.  There's also an option to substitute rice with lentils, yum!"}
{"text":"Found the place on yelp and very very happy to have found it. The portions are large and the food is fantastic and fresh. Be prepared to stand in line."}
{"text":"It is the best value you can find in the whole GTA even include the suburbs I have to say with the quality they offer. My favorite is their seabass combo, with such tender and flavourful fish plus calamari with two delicious salad on thw side, hmmmmmmm I can eat at this place everyday all year long."}
{"text":"The salads are pre-prepared and the smoked salmon was packaged. But it's still pretty good and tasty, but more importantly SUPER cheap! It was like $5 for a smoked salmon pita and 2 salads. You can't beat that."}
{"text":"2.5 - Food, but bumped up 'cause it's cheap!  Primarily takeout.  2-3 stools at a bar, in front of window.  Super ma 'n pa place across the street from Cumberland Terrace, beside the cigar place.    When I came in, around 4pm, a middle-aged lady was peeling sweet potatoes, while sneaking in a bite.  Homey?  Yes.  Sanitary?  Questionable.  There was also bags of garbage outside as I believe they were getting ready to close for the day.  BUT, it's cheap and hence its popularity.  I got a grilled chicken (2 pieces of kabob) pita wrap WITH a generous side salad for $5.  Like where can you get a meal, that you won't even be able to finish, for $5...downtown??!!  Nowhere, that's where!  Food was just OK, wasn't anything that I'd rush back for, completely edible, fairly healthy.  I'm able to write off my meals, but didn't bother asking for a receipt 'cause this place seemed like a cash business and they didn't charge me tax.  Not very friendly, just going through the motions type attitude.  No gloves used while assembling wrap.  So expect service to be in-line with the pricing!  :)"}
{"text":"- Sea bass and veggie combo ($7) - Service is usually better if you beat the lunch time rush (12pm) - Great vegetarian options available as well - Tip : Its cash only - Rare spot to consistently keep top notch without significantly increasing price."}
{"text":"This was the first place my bf and I visited while in Toronto.  We were very tired from traveling from Niagara Falls to Downtown Toronto and wanted something close to our hotel.    Yelp led us here.  I am a sucker for all things spicy, so the fact that they had a yummy spicy sauce is the reason they get 4 stars on my list.  Not only that, their food is reasonably priced.  My boyfriend and I shared a beef kabob plate for $5.  Ohhhh and their rice was AMAZING!  But, the only downside was the service.  If there was a separate rating for service, I'd give them 2 stars.  The lady was unfriendly!!!"}
{"text":"Awww Yiiiss. Finally, somewhere in the city where I can get an extremely filling and healthy meal for a fiver. You can either grab rice, 2 salads and some protein, (choice of chicken, beef cutlet, seafood, or a veggie lentil loaf), or health it right up and get a selection of three salads and your protein. Their salads tend to be on the acidic side, with an emphasis on flavouring their food with heaps of lemon juice, pepper and a bit of vinegar, but you can cut that by ordering their pasta or potato salad (which is one of my fav things ever). They've also got kick- butt fattoush, coleslaw, bean and veggie salad to choose from. If your feeling sassy and spicey, they will squirt your protein with some excellent hot sauce and tahini.  Now, be warned, there is a line-up half a block during lunch time. Sometimes you can get lucky and the line-up will be short, but during good weather, be ready to wait. Going during lunch is also when their ingredients are the freshest; I've popped in around 3 pm and their fattoush and coleslaw was limp and soggy, and although it tasted great, that fresh crunch was missing.  But all in all a great little place. The staff look like they want to kill you, but they make great food!"}
{"text":"OVERRATED!! I rather go to Salad Days! I got in line and when it was my turn I asked for a salad without onions. The two ladies working behind the counter looked very annoyed with my request and pointed to two salads that \"should not\" have onions in them, but probably did because when you looked at them, each salad had pieces of another salad in them. It was so messy! I ordered the famous fish platter and there was nothing special about it. The portion was okay--probably not as generous in the salad department since I had to go with the the vegetables, and they were stingy with the serving. I also thought the fish combo came with shrimps, but apparently that is no longer the case. Anyway, the vibe of the place (dirty/crowded/messy) and the quality of the food was enough to make a mental note to never return. My colleague loves the pita place next door, so I will give them a try--and their line was quite long, so it can't be that bad. Right?"}
{"text":"Great value for this neighborhood!  I had a sea bass combo (with rice,2 salads, calamari rings, shrimps) , i wash fresh and tasty. Worth waiting 10 min if you have them. Will be back"}
{"text":"Yes Xtreme Taste rocks as one of the very few $7 dollars and under lunch spots in a spendy neighbourhood, but it's no holy grail.  Don't expect to sit (there are barely any seats) or glean anything pleasing from the ambiance, because there simply is NO AMBIANCE here.  Think of Extreme Taste as more like a middle eastern hot/ cold cafeteria style lunch take-out counter.  If you want the most of variety get here EARLY for lunch!  Yes, yes the line-up is wickid, but if you wait til about 2-3 o'clock there is usually a scant selection of pretty much nothing left.  Luckily the veggie option is always available for late lunchers like myself and if you don't mind double helpings of lentil salads or chickpeas with a languid/petrified spinach pie for lunch, then you're golden.    Because of the fact that most Yorkville lunch eateries like Freshii, Holt's Cafe and Pusi's literally gouge a chunk outta your life savings, Extreme Taste by default ends up looking like the champion of lunches, but there's nothing here that's life changing in terms of taste...in my opinion I find Salad House across the street is way more on the money."}
{"text":"Seeing a huge line snaking down the sidewalk in front of a restaurant is always a good indiction that something decent is happening inside.  I thought I would jump into line to see what all the fuss was about.  The wait was about 10-15 minutes before I reached the counter.  Behind the glass, a selection of 6-8 salads and a menu (not really legible) with a few lunch specials, all between $5-$8.  I got a small salad with 2 selections - fatouche and bean.  It was $3.  I should have gotten the chicken sandwich special for $5.  I'll be back to try some of the other items on the menu.  $5 for a lunch downtown is quite a steal."}
{"text":"$6 for a healthy lunch!  Long line ups during lunch but they are fast. You get a ton of food and when you finish you won't feel gross because it's clean eating."}
{"text":"Super cheap and delicious. Go before the lunch rush for a grilled chicken salad with potatoes and other raw veggies. I love their broccoli. It's so crunchy and perfectly peppered with vinegar. This place will redefine your lunch. Head here if you work near Yonge and Bloor for a try. It's near the Pizza Pizza and they take cash only. $5 for a huge lunch and there's always a line up. Pro-tip: Go around 11:30 AM or earlier. Pro-tip 2: There's no seating so you'll have to eat on a bench nearby."}
{"text":"This is the best lunch in the city for those of us who are health conscious and flavour loving. The first time I stopped in, I almost didnt believe they only wanted $5 for a huge box of beautiful salads that were literally heaping with a nice serving of grilled chicken on top. FOR $5 dollars!!!   The move at Extreme is to get the salad special, which is a choice of 3 salads (i usually opt for fattoush, bulgur and chickpea but i mix it up alot and they have 7+ salad choices) with either chicken or sea bass and calamari on top.   honestly its incredibly and I try and schedule my day so i'm in the area and can hop in there for lunch 2-3x week.  if you're obscenely hungry, get 2 combos (ive done this, and saved the second salad for a pre-dinner meal)."}
{"text":"This is a very small joint hidden away in Yorkville - if not for my coworker who introduced me to this place, I would have walked right past it.   I ordered a sea bass combo and my friend ordered a chicken sandwich. The sea bass was quite fresh and tender. It broke apart easily when eating and was not dry at all. It is served on a bed of rice along with two sides. Portion wise - it is more than enough for lunch. I didn't see the bed of rice so I got their macaroni salad - tasted great but too many carbs for my liking.   The chicken sandwich was good as well - except it was a pita rather than a sandwich. This place had other menu options including a smoked salmon sandwich (or pita?) so I will be coming back to this place.   Did I mention that this lunch was really cost effective considering the neighbourhood and average cost of meals?"}
{"text":"I have to say, when establishments' names have \"Xtreme\" in their name, the word following it never lives up to the name.    In the case of Xtreme Taste, there are huge lineups out the door for this place.  Portions are huge, food is cheap but I wouldn't say the best food I have ever had (I had the vegetarian meal, which had falafel, spanakopita, tabbouleh, and other salads.)  Certainly, the taste was not extreme.  However, for cheap and plentiful this place is it for lunch!"}
{"text":"Very cheap and overall great value for what you get. I was impressed at what I got for only a few bucks. The place gets pretty busy at lunchtime but it's understandable that this place is so popular."}
{"text":"On the hunt for a cheap meal, I decided to give this place a try at lunchtime due to the abundance of rave reviews. I had high expectations, and sadly, they were not met. Not even close.  I ordered the $5 beef + chicken lunch special, with rice and 2 salads. First off all, the portions were NOT huge like I was expecting from reading previous reviews. Barely any rice, and a few pitiful portions of meat. I certainly do not consider this a \"filling\" meal. There was barely any food!  Second, everything was COLD. Not lukewarm, not cool, but cold. The chicken was tough and took forever to chew. The beef was only slightly better.   Lastly, it was *incredibly* salty. Huge, huge turnoff. I'm pretty sure I met the daily recommended value of sodium just from that meal alone, and I didn't even eat the whole thing! I couldn't bring myself to do so. I got the spinach salad and broccoli and cauliflower, both drenched in dressing. I took a tiny bite out of the cauliflower and promptly spit it back out. Sodium overload, and very acidic. The spinach was more or less the same. Both the broccoli and cauliflower were hard as rock.  I downed a whole bottle of water afterwards in an attempt to wash the taste out of my mouth.  Long story short, I regret spending my five dollars here. This was a total fail and I will not be returning after this horrible first impression.  To be honest, the meal could have been a dollar or two and I still would have been very unimpressed.  I can't wait to go home and cook myself a healthy and edible meal."}
{"text":"My go to place for $5 to $6 buck a loonies.  Look for  \"Xtreme Taste.\"  signage.  Got to be the best deal in the area. A take out shop run by two very nice ladies who make yummy cheap food.  I like the bass plate. For $6, a plate filled with a nice slab of tender sea bass, a skewer of shrimp, a few pieces of tender calamari, rice, and salad. It's enough for 2 meals but eat the whole thing.   The veggie plate is $5 and plate full of salad and a veggie patty."}
{"text":"How can anyone say no to $5 lunches !? And that's $5 after tax so no need to fumble for change or figure out which pocket the coins will go in. Get the seabass and calamari for only $1 more. What a deal !  They definitely do not skimp on the portion sizes. Prepare for a line out the door during prime lunch time, personally always come later to avoid the lineups.  So here's what comes with the main, choice of rice and two sides or no rice and three sides. Most of the sides are sour except the macaroni, fusilli and bean salad. The spinach salad is extremely sour, tastes like it was soaked in vinegar. Good mix with the non sour sides. The chicken and beef kebob, is a piece of cooked meat lightly seasoned. The chicken was a little dry and the beef felt a little rough. The seabass and calamari are also cooked just right, not overlooked at all and light flavour. Everything is topped with tzatziki and hot sauce.  Overall, can't decide what to have for lunch or trying to save money or just want a good lunch with no surprises, will come here ! Many more visits to come in the future."}
{"text":"You will be hard pressed to find a bigger/tastier/healthier meal for $5 in this area. All their lunches are $5-6 and include 1-2 proteins (calamari/chicken/beef/falafel/fish) as well as 2-3 choices of fresh salads. The ladies are friendly and efficient. There is almost always a line up around lunch time buts it's well worth the wait (15-20 minutes usually)! Bonus... All prices include tax (though they only take cash)"}
