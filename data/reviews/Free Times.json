{"text":"I love to go there and have the bagels and locks. Just like in Montreal! excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for their famous AYCE Sunday brunch buffet based on positive reviews, but was a bit disappointed. When we arrived, we were told the owner would come to our table and give us a brief history about the restaurant, but after ~15-20 min. of waiting we gave up and headed to the buffet. We were hungry! The buffet had a lot of variety and many of the traditional Jewish favorites. The Challah french toast, latkes, freshwater fish cakes, home-made horseradish and quinoa salad were absolutely delicious. The live Jewish music and great service by the wait staff also enhanced our dining experience. But for $20/person, we were disappointed to see items from Costco in the buffet, particularly in the dessert section. When you claim that you're offering \"authentic homemade\" Jewish food, that is what one should expect to be served. Not sure if we'd go here again based on our experience."}
{"text":"Second time back here! The vibe, staff and food are all excellent.

Got the beef brisket, it was flavourful and melts in your mouth. Definitely a must try"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate Free Times Cafe at zero.  The place was filthy, the staff incompetent, the cook beligerent.  I asked for a simple dish (eggs) to be done with no garnish due to allergy concerns, as well as making sure my need for milk free and other allergies were accomodated.  The food was deliverd cold and covered in some kind of unrecognizable green garnish.  The server had not communicated my needs to the cook.  However, when asked to replace the food, and not resuse parts of it, the server came back to tell me that the chef refused to provide me the correct meal!  After argueing with the server about this, he once again spoke to the cook who said that he would reuse some of it, which was all covered in an allergen for me.  And it would get cold.  And I was told I'd have to wait behind all the other customers despite ruining my food to begin with.  This complete disrespect for allergies, the customer, and the horrible way I was treated would leave me never to return.  Beware."}
{"text":"Free TImes is a fantastic bar/restaurant/cafe/venue.  The servers are all super nice and fast, the kitchen is open late, and the food is really good.  Last night the owner (Judy) introduced herself and ended up making us a bunch of extra food for free (thanks for the Sliders Judy!)  She also makes her own special mustard - an essential addition if you order Smoked Meat (which is also very good).  All in all, this is a perfect place to go if you want to relax, have some drinks, and eat some delicious food."}
{"text":"Ok, DON'T  go here for food. It's overpriced, for the portions, cold and the service was awful. The waitress had half a brain and borderline straight rude. For the price you can get  way better meal down the street at Nirvana or Sneaky Dee's, this is definitely not one of College Street's finest even though its a been a landmark of the area.

That all being said, they usually have interesting and good local musicians playing in the back and I have enjoyed a number of shows there.  

In short- go for the music and drinks, skip the food!"}
{"text":"I came here for a NXNE show the other night and was horribly offended by this place.

The venue has a \"one drink minimum\", which means when you walk through the door the waitress harasses you to buy a drink. I probably would have ordered a drink anyway, but being forced to buy a drink upon entering the place and interrupting the performer is just plain rude. I will never come here again. I hope NXNE skips this place next year too, there's so many amazing venues in Toronto where one can order a drink (or not) at their leisure."}
{"text":"If you like fruit flies in the beer taps in the summer, roaches crawling on the bar and a verbally abusive owner, this is the place for you. I used to go here..and now I will never consume anything here again. O_O"}
{"text":"GREAT ALL-DAY BREAKFAST

I am a fan of Free Times, especially for the all-day breakfast.  If you arrive for breakfast before 11:30am, it is cheaper.  Then 2 eggs, strip bacon, toast, 2 latkes, a bit of salad and a bit of fruit on the side will cost you $8.99 after tax, and that includes coffee!  It is such a tasty meal that I don't mind when I am a bit late and it costs the regular price. (Around $2 more.)

Aside from brekkie, I also go for dinner sometimes.  They usually have a $5 special for a pint of beer, and I enjoy a chicken club sandwich with a super-garlicky (in a good way) caesar salad.

Service is usually excellent, although the food can vary slightly, from good to excellent."}
{"text":"I was appalled at the greeting I received from the manager of this place. I was walking around the area after a day of job-hunting and decided to pop in for a quick drink. At the bar the manager was speaking with a waitress, clearly frustrated with her. She then turned around, before I could even say hello or order my drink, she sees the white folder and looks at me with contempt and just says \"No. Dont wanna hear it, dont wanna hear it, not now, just go. Go. Go away. Not now.\"
I had no intention to hand in a resume there and even if I did that was unbelievably rude, I am still a customer. I had been told before that it was a friendly place but never have I been greeted in a cafe so rudely."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 out of 5.  The bartender James, or Jesse, plays fantastic music.   He is on top of it.  Greeted with sincerity and a smile.    Every time.    This place is my new go to.    The brisket is also fantastic."}
{"text":"Oy!

Sunday Brunch at Free Times Café is like no other brunch you'll find in the city.  For me, it was like crashing a family get-together full of complete strangers, yet feeling strangely welcome.

I've had dinner on the patio a few times but never realized what an extensive dining area lay inside, including a lovely back room that makes 40 feel cozy and served as stage for an experience that had me feeling like an honorary Jew by the time I stepped back out the front door almost two hours later.

I wondered what I was signing up for when Avigail suggested we head out for \"Jewish Brunch.\"  After briefly lamenting the absence of bacon (or ham, or sausage, for that matter) I decided to go in with an open mind and try something completely new to me.  As it turns out, it's possible to get absolutely stuffed on a delicious brunch buffet without consuming an ounce of pork! 

Saturday brunch is a la carte; I highly recommend waiting an extra day and heading in on Sunday for the buffet ($20), especially since many of the same items are served.* I'm not one to drop $2-$3 on a few paltry sips of orange juice or coffee with my breakfast, but both are included in the price (!), the OJ is fresh squeezed (!!) and the servers are quick with a free refill (!!!).**

Another perk of holding out for Sunday is the klezmer band (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klezmer), which plays sets at 11:15 and 1:15. Guests are welcomed and the band introduced by more-hostess-than-proprietor Judy Perly, who brings a sense of warmth and celebration to the occasion that makes it feel like a special one even when it's not.

The Food

Being a complete neophyte to Jewish cuisine, I made the most of the trip and tried as many different things as I could possibly fit down my hatch.  I was delighted with almost all of them.  

The latkes were delightfully thick and crispy cakes of shredded potato, served with traditional sour cream and apple sauce.  The blintzes were stuffed with cheese (ricotta?) and laced with just a hint of orange. They're deceptively filling, so just have one if you want to sample the spread. A host of bagels with cream cheeses and other topping options was next; I opted for cream cheese with lox (cured salmon) and was left a very happy camper.  Scrambled eggs with lox also found their way onto my plate (delicious), as did two salmon cakes that stand out as the sole regrettable choice of the day.  Fish was offered in several smoked and pickled varieties, followed by veggie and fruit plates and finally a spread of traditional Jewish and North American desserts, including dates (which I happen to love) and a crumbly-but-tasty sesame cake.

My favourite dish of the entire array was by far the pickled herring.  Not the sort of thing you want to eat a lot of even if you are a fish fan, but the big chunks of tender fish and surprisingly tame brine made it hard to resist.

* Make a reservation.

** The coffee, as it happens, is lousy.  I recommend pre-caffeinating with a latte from Manic just down the road."}
{"text":"My boyfriend posted a bad review here but it seems not to be listed so I am posting about it again. 

Very disappointed. We live nearby, my boyfriend and his family had been coming here regularly for years as a tradition and always enjoyed it. 

However New Years Day last year we all attended for a birthday meal, as a group of 5. After sitting we were told we would have to move tables. We didn't mind that and we did moved.

The food was below their usual standard and the service was slower than usual but they had a big party in so we gave them the benefit of the doubt. Again, no complaint there.

When it came time to pay we gave slightly under 12% tip which we thought reflected the experience. It was something we discussed quite a bit since we usually tip generously, especially at our 'local'  - The Free Times.
The owner then came to our table and told us that 15% tip minimum was customary as the server would have to tip out the kitchen staff and asked us to add 5 more dollars to the tip. They did not ask how the food was or if there were any issues with the service, just told us they expected a higher tip. 

We handed over $5 out of embarrassment (something the owner did not show) but let them know upon leaving that we would not be returning. The owner was unconcerned.

It's a loss to myself and my boyfriend, as well as to my future in-laws as it was a place we all felt comfortable and which was easily accessible (there are some mobility issues) but now we will not return."}
{"text":"Came here for an impromptu Sunday brunch with family and was pleasantly surprised by the \"Bella! Did Ya Eat?\" Jewish brunch buffet, that happens every Sunday.  We had no clue this was going on at all.  There was live music (Kiezmer and Yiddish Cabaret) happening in the back room which we didn't see but could hear and was a nice touch.  The buffet consisted mostly of various salads with some classic Jewish fare such as cheese blintzes, potato latkes and gefilte fish.  There was also a dessert section with various tarts, cakes and fruit.  

The buffet is set up by the front door which can get a bit crowded with people coming and going, as well as the narrow hallway between the dining room and the entrance/buffet area.  The owner, Judy seemed to make it a point to greet all of the guests personally and all of the servers were friendly and circulated around the restaurant often.  

This was a fun and interesting experience.  The food wasn't anything fancy but if you're looking for something out of the ordinary and open to trying different things I would definitely recommend stopping by on a Sunday for brunch."}
{"text":"I met three friends here to try out their mid-week breakfast (vs. weekend brunch). 3 of us had the breakfast special at 7.95, which included 2 eggs, \"bacon\" or sliced tomatoes, 2 latkes, a multigrain bagel and coffee.  It is still excellent, but lost a star for the following reasons;

It \"opens\" at 10 am.  (A tad late for breakfast.)
It opened at 10:10 am.  (Inexcusable.  Staff was inside, while we huddled outside.)
Chef doesn't do poached eggs.  (Wha???)
No condiments were included with the latkes.  Sour cream was $1 extra.  (How can latkes be served without sour cream or apple sauce?  Both are served when one orders them as a meal or side.)

Why did I only subtract 1 star for all the infractions listed above?  I still love this place.  The food is excellent, the server was friendly and (eventually) attentive, the coffee was above average, the vibe is great, the music was nice, it's an institution, they support local musicians, the Sunday brunch is fantastic...need I go on?"}
{"text":"There's nothing free at the Free Times Cafe! Their website clearly states $8.95 for all day breakfast before 11:30am, well I was there before 11am and our server told us $10.95, when we showed her the website on our phone she seemed to agree and we were under the impression they would honor their website add. After we placed our order another lady, who seemed to be the owner or manager, came over to tell us that it was $10.95 and their website was incorrect. No apology, no \"we'll honor it this once\" nothing. As for the food I'll start by saying that we were told the kitchen did not \"have time\" to do poached eggs!!! What we ended up with was greasy eggs, cold bacon, hard as rocks potato latkes and wilted mushy lettuce. Oh and beware of asking for rye toast, that will cost you an extra dollar!! The only saving grace was our waiter, who was very attentive with refilling our coffee, and also very personable. If you're looking for a place that appreciates your patronage this is not the place."}
{"text":"I think of soup lunches and I think of beer on the small street patio at the northern entrance to the Kensington Market.

They have open mic nights for a variety of events: poetry, music, comedy...

The hummus and warm pita bits are a good snack."}
{"text":"The best I can say about this place is that it's just okay. We went to see a friend's show here, and the food was on-site, so it was purely out of convenience that we ate here on a Saturday night, not because it was the best choice in the vicinity.

The latkes were oily (not drained enough) and smelled like other foods. I wanted to tell the waitress that they should change their oil; I've worked in restaurants enough to know when it needs to be changed.

The food was expensive: $14 for a medium-sized chicken Caesar salad with lettuce that was warm and didn't seem fresh. The potato and blintz plate was about the same price range. (The apple sauce for the blintz was super-sweet.) The \"homemade\" iced tea that the waitress talked up was a simple strong tea, nothing special at all. Certainly not $4's worth.

I chalk it up to money going to a good cause--my friend's show--but certainly wouldn't spend money on food here again."}
{"text":"Situated in a small corner in Kensington market, this Jewish household speaks family and traditions. Me and my friend went there for Sunday brunch and the owner, Judy, personally came and explained the buffet brunch menu to all the tables. The brunch options were great, salmon and scrambled eggs, latkes and the likes. They also had a good array of middle eastern salads. What was different here was the amount of fish items; I have never had fish for breakfast before and this was a first but I was delighted by it. We forgot to take the sweet jelly sauce for latkes and the sour cream for our scrambled egg so Judy came personally to serve that. The brunch buffet is $21+tax and comes with bottomless coffee and orange juice as well, definitely try their orange juice which is fresh and sweet. My favourite part was the dessert menu. The place also has live performance and we sat through few of the Jewish songs played by a small ensemble, the entire ambience was joyous and fun! Judy also made the audience do traditional \"Oy!\"s with her. Felt like I was part of this huge extended family who share traditions with Toronto's heritage and most importantly, felt like I was home."}
{"text":"Comfy little bar next to Kensington Market, Free Times Cafe has some regular tables for customers who just wanna grab a bite. The good thing about this place is the small stage for singstars wannabes but with like real voice and real guitars and stuff.
Customers can enjoy the new Toronto's talents with a good beer and a burger."}
{"text":"You can't beat $5 all in (quality!) craft beers, 'best of' open mic, and patrons who bring birthday cake to feed the entire bar. Perhaps it was my lucky night, but everything about the service, selection, and tunes were just right! 

Helpful tip: open mic happens in a separate  (curtained off) intimate room with a stage, which, unless you suffer from claustrophobia in reasonably large spaces...is a (much needed) escape from the outside world! After all, isn't this why townies so fell in love with speakeasies?"}
{"text":"Free Times Cafe is famous for the AYCE buffet for Sunday brunch so I thought I would have their sampler plate typical of what you would get at the buffet. It was $16.95 and included a bagel, cream cheese, smoked salmon, latkes, along with those scrumptious blintzes. Those are egg crepes filled with sweet, lemon flavoured cottage cheese. Solid and filling. The latkes go well with the sour cream and homemade cinnamon apple sauce. Delicious!
Since it's still winter the fruit accompanying the plate was a little pale, but that's understandable. It was a lively Saturday and the place was hopping with early afternoon brunch parties and the beer was flowing steadily. Truly a enjoyable and enduring restaurant and a fixture along with College Street strip."}
{"text":"I've been a number of times for open mike night when my friends are playing, and usually take advantage of their drink specials, but this weekend was the first time I went for their 'Bella, Did you Eat'  Jewish style buffet breakfast.

Oy. Excellent. The meal starts off with coffee, tea, and fresh squeezed orange juice, which is included in the price. Then on to the front of the restaurant where the buffet is displayed. There was a wide variety of both sweet and savory dishes. Eggs with either apple or smoked salmon, french toast, fresh fried latke's (and least when I went up), blintzes, lox and bagels, gefilte fish, fresh fruit, salads, home made baba ganoush, and dessert items! Wowza.

This is a dairy meal, meaning because they serve dairy they don't serve any meat, but fill up on smoked salmon, and I swear, it won't be a problem! (And this comes from a bacon LOVER.)

My only complaint was that the service was less than stellar. A pitcher of milk was spilled, clean up was haphazard, orders for coffee and tea were forgotten. Still, it's a buffet, and you don't really deal with the servers that much. And I have received good service before, so maybe it was just an off day.

Another note, there is live music, which is fun, but we were seated near the front, and the noise did make it difficult to talk (and was probably rude to the musicians to chat through their set). If you're there to catch up maybe request a table further away from the stage (or be prepared to feel guilt like I did.)

$19.95 brunch =$26 with tax and 15% tip. (What do people normally tip on a buffet where you serve yourself?)"}
{"text":"Never had Jewish food and didnt know what to expect from their brunch on Sunday but I was blown away. Their blintzes, cod cakes and lox w/ cream cheese in bagels were the fav's but the whole spread which was fish and dairy based was off the chain good and well worth the price for all you can eat."}
{"text":"\"JUDY HERE\"
hahahaha glad I found this place through vine. very nice food"}
{"text":"Came for a open mic night for a guy I used to work with's band. The venue is very intimate and friendly. They get Indy bands and students in the neighbourhoods bands mostly to come to play on open mic nights. They serve food and all beverages which is great. They have a nice front patio too right along college street where you can enjoy a drink or coffee when the weathers nice. At night it totally depends on a- the crowd b- the performers and c how busy it is as too how your night will be. I always have a good time tho!!"}
{"text":"I love this cafe. They have the best Jewish Brunch in the city. You have to book it in advance as they always have a full house but it's a wonderful experience. I love the scrambled eggs with salmon (they used salmon instead of bacon to keep it kosher). It was heavenly. They had all of the breakfast foods you would want to eat in the morning. 

They also have a live band playing Jewish folk music. It was a great experience and I would definitely go back. :)"}
{"text":"This review is only for the Sunday Yiddish All-You-Can-Eat Brunch. This place is always busy and it's best to reserve a table during one of their two seating periods. 

The food is definitely unique from a restaurant perspective. It is the dairy side of traditional Kosher cooking which includes loads of carbs, dairy, veggies, and seafood. You won't find any meat from land animals so while the overall meal may not be vegetarian perfection, it is a dream come true for Pescetarians. That being said, most options are vegetarian-friendly so don't be turned off by the few fishy options.

What really adds a bit of extra to this experience is that they always have Klezmer musicians playing a set that starts in the late morning. More entertaining though is the opening act which is always the owner of the restaurant going up on stage and sharing her story of how she started the brunch buffet and teaching the audience a little bit about Ashkenazi culture and humor. It's a real treat! :D

The food is very good although it can be a tad pricey even for an all you can eat. I would suggest that if you enjoy bunch style meals, you should give this place at least one try. If it's your think, you will no doubt become a regular. :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for eating hearty vegetarian food. Generous portions. Comfortable setting."}
{"text":"I went here once because Grasshopper next door was closed but was pleasantly surprised by their vegan options. The food seemed pricy at first but the portions were great. We had a platter full of hummus, roasted veggies, chickpeas, and all kinds of little veggie nibbles. It had flavour and did the job, simple and tasty.
Came back another time when I forgot my ID and Sneaky Dee's didn't let me in. They had a veggie special that night and it was a rice dish with spiced squash puree and falafels. It tasted home made, like someone 's mom made it for me..I mean that in the best way possible. Our server was excellent that night, too. The patio is perfect on a summer evening.
Next time I will go back intentionally!"}
{"text":"This place is a pile full of fun. Usually a three star bar, you probably wont discover its four starness until you realize that they have pretty decent free  music in the backroom like..almost everyday of the week.
They have a great side room that you can book for events
And they have jewish brunch on weekends.

Yes, this place is a weird ass mish mash of all things you love about toronto plus some randoms to boot.   

A pretty good date idea if you are in the neighbourhood and want to check out the live music in the back room."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years, but returned to enjoy their tasty beverages on our New Year's Eve bar crawl. Service was super friendly and we were never left with an empty glass (which probably explains the big blank spot in my memory later on in the evening). While we were there, there was a band in the back, which sounded great (I could hear through the bathroom wall). 

There's a check-in deal for a free latke which I totally plan on cashing in on soon. I recall their food was super tasty the last time I was there."}
{"text":"Love this place! I was here last week for the open stage event and had a great time. The staff treats everyone like old friends. It's a very laid back atmosphere. You will definitely meet new friends (I got the chance to talk to several uoft students). I enjoyed the music, the drinks and the company."}
{"text":"Free wi-fi
Friendly service
Good breakfast/brunch

I like!  Came here after a little stroll around town, and had a plain jane standard breakfast, 2 eggs, back bacon, and toast.  what made this extra special were the latkes.  mmmm two crispy lumps of deep fried shredded potato and batter goodness. I'm still salivating thinking about it. 
My sidekick had the three -egg omelet, which had asparagus, which I feel should be put in omelets in many more places (:

Two had a pretty hearty and satisfying breakfast for less than $20"}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner sitting out on the patio on a warm evening over the weekend.

I have to start by saying that none of their Jewish food is as good as the stuff that my mom makes. 

That said...the brisket and latkes were tasty and so were the chicken skewers. My friends who never had a blintze enjoyed them, but they really weren't even close to what I am used to having. 

The sangria was also lovely on a hot night. 

I would want to give this place 3.5 stars but that is not an option."}

Bagels? Check
Live Yiddish Klezmer music? Check

It's very tough being Jewish downtown. Deli's, Dairies and a good old fashioned bagel house are very few and far between downtown. If i'm craving a lox bagel, eggs and onions or a scoop of tuna I usually have to head north to one of my favourite Jewish brunch joints. BUT for the past couple of years I've allowed Judy's Bella brunch to fill that void.

As I'm sure you've read countless reviews on 'Bella Did Ya Eat' brunch, I will only kibitz for a brief moment. I'm a bit of a nostalgic buff, as you can probably already tell from my other reviews. I yearn for a piece of the past, even the ones I've never experienced. In this sense, the shtetl (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtetl)
I really believe Judy has re created this with her brunch. Music from the old world, chatty gossiping ringing from each table and plates rotating varying Jewish soul food treats. There's so much food and its good too. Blintzes, latkas, french toast, eggs and onion, bagels, lox, dips and spreads, cheese, fruit and more more more. They are constantly refilling so everything's fresh and delicious. Bella's brunch is a perfect place to bring family, a few friends, a 3rd date, or some people who want a new brunch experience. The only problem is you have to keep it down for most of the brunch because of the music. There's also a limited seating time, so by the time the music if finished you've got to hit the road. No worries, you have plenty of time to eat and relax. It's just not the place if you haven't seen your friend in a couple years and want to catch up. I've experienced a few dozen of the 'shhhh's'. (There is another room, away from the music you can sit in)

Judy doesn't stop at brunch. She's a smart business woman who loves what she does and constantly offers other exciting events at her restaurant. Almost every other night there's some type of music event happening at Free Times. Whether it's an open mic on Mondays, an old band doing one last hoorah or a new one not even discovered, Judy searches high and low to always give her patrons a reason to come back. There's breakfast, lunch and dinner. They're open early and close date.

Overall, I give Free Times a 3.5/5. The brunch is fab, but I haven't been as impressed by the menu items. The servers can sometimes be hit or miss (Judy is always a hit) but I keep coming back for a taste of tradition. Judy does it so well. I really believe she deserves a star on College street for remaining fresh, unusual and dependable. As they say in the old world, \"come for the schtick and stay for a nosh\""}
{"text":"I order with uber eats very often. I am a vegan. however tonight I had a nightmare situation FreeTimes Cafe. I ordered the tofu burger, I get it, take a bite, and it's meat!!! I am 33 and haven't eaten meat since I was 10. I feel sick to my stomach. I took 2 bites of the burger before asking my boyfriend who isn't vegan, it's a meat patty. I'm disgusted that I eat a dead animal. I called the store. what a mistake. no customer service.! the owner Judy Perly said to talk to the chef. why would a customer want to speak to the chef? makes no sense. they couldn't send a replacement meal because it was past 11. so basically I was screwed out of the price of my burger. I wanted a refund, they laughed at me being vegan. honestly I am questioning why uber would deal with this kind of operation. if the call was recorded it would be a horror show. 
If you're vegetarian or vegan please do not trust this place"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast, but service was slow and slightly unfriendly. We had eggs and my friend has a sandwich.  They were ok. Nothing special, probably won't be back"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!

I like the layout of it and the soft music they had playing in the background. The service was amazing. We had this one young woman describe to us the specials and she was really delightful and witty. We then had our server who was a bit quieter but really very sweet. I love when a place takes care to ensure quality customer service.

I ordered the pint they had on special and my friend ordered the sangria which she loved. I then ordered the falafel plate and it was really, really tasty! The portion was huge - I couldn't finish everything I got! The falafel was really good - potentially the best I've had thus far in Toronto. 

All in all, a great experience. I'm looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here after work with my boyfriend to grab a quick bite to eat. Really chill atmosphere and a spacious patio area that is group friendly.

Drinks: I got their Caesar for $9 and he got a mojito for $8, all taxes included. My Caesar is a good size (1 pint with 2oz vodka), very well made, spicy and peppery which I really enjoy. His mojito is quite small (less than half a pint), and we both didn't like it very much; it had so much sugar that it never dissolved and it's crunchy between the teeth when you drink it. The mint was also not fresh.

Food: I got a Free Times burger ($14.95) that came with a selection of 3 toppings from a list of toppings. I chose sauteed onions, guacomole (that actually came as a side), and a fried egg. I was very impressed by the amount of veggies it came with. Ample amount of lettuce, tomatoes and onions on top of your selection of toppings. The beef patty was very juicy but lacked some seasoning. The burger can't be eaten on its own you need to add some ketchup or other condiments. With the burger, you can choose to have a side of fries, potato salad, soup or coleslaw. I chose coleslaw and it was very fresh, made with red cabbage. It also came with yummy aioli on the side. The food was delicious overall and I would purchase again.

Service: Can't complain. The service was fast, and I had taken the waiter's choice of Caesar over Sangria which I'm happy about. 

I would definitely come back. 4/5 stars because of the price and the failure of a mojito. Besides that would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Back in my UofT days, I had frequented Free Times after nights in the area.  Decent pub grub (well, I stuck to the fries) and pretty darn cozy.  About two weeks before my wedding, though, my dad decided that he wanted to host a brunch for the family and asked me to find a place.  Some of the brunch spots right by where we were staying were either booked already or didn't take weekend reservations.  Then a nagging voice in the back of my head reminded me that Free Times offered a Jewish Brunch that I never took advantage of.  Oy vey!

Judy helped us book our group of about 30 (we have a big fam, what can I say?)  The brunch buffet is pretty large and features several traditional Jewish foods, albeit not all breakfasty items.  Think lox, eggs & onions, lox with bagels, latkes, rugelach, gefilte fish, and blintzes.  I wasn't blown away by the food - my Bubby did better - but it was decent.  The atmosphere, though, is hilarious.  Think old world Jew meet a semi-hip clientele... then again it is Kensington-adjacent.  

We enjoyed the Klezmer music and the older folks liked the communal \"oys.\"  The music they get is pretty darn good, I got to say.  The service was also pretty good and we all had a great time.  Thanks Free Times!"}
{"text":"Open mic on Monday evenings at 7:30pm. Mostly older men playing guitar and harmonica. Small cozy area with excellent service. 

Got the small matzo ball soup (~$5), and it comes with bread and butter. Nice presentation. I love caraway bread but expected it toasted. It was neither fresh nor stale. The soup is clear and too salty! Could only drink a few spoons. I think they boiled it to death too. The one piece of celery I had disintegrated and was all yellow.

Also, I never had matzo ball so I didn't know what it's supposed to be like. For me, I'm not a fan of this bland mushy ball that has the texture of of soaked bread and tofu."}
{"text":"Free Times is a college st. staple.  Great food, eclectic entertainment, entertaining staff.  Just a good time all the way around.

Their Sunday brunch is amazing - definitely something to get to if you can.  You'll leave stuffed with blintzes, lox, brisket, and more salads than you'll know what to do with.

If you're really lucky, there'll be a klezmer band playing - such fun!"}
{"text":"Je n'y suis allée que le soir, mais l'ambiance était toujours bonne. En effet le bar comprend une salle ou des musiciens peuvent jouer ou chanter, on peut y assister à condition de consommer 1 boisson, normal me direz-vous.

Le bar est très bien desservi par les street car de College st et Spadina.

Le service est toujours parfait mais les consommations chères (3,25$ le verre de coca, no refill)"}
{"text":"The Free Times Cafe is like that old college haunt that you frequent to hear your friend strum on his guitar. Which is exactly what I do about once a month. 

The open mic night is a great way for fledging artists to have their music heard. I've heard some really great up and coming Toronto artist come through here on more than one occasion. Although honestly the acoustics suck and they could do a little more to amp up the performance area. However, beggars can't be choosers and Free Times often has a pretty solid crowd in attendance - a must for any aspiring musician. 

The waitstaff is also super friendly and attentive here and the food is unexpectedly delicious. I highly recommend it for brunch especially. 

Plus, Free Times is a great place just to grab a beer and people watch on College Street."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, so to be fair, maybe it was just an off day for the cook or something.  My boyfriend and I were wandering around Toronto at around 3pm on a Friday trying to find a place to eat a late lunch.  We stumbled upon Free Times Cafe and thought it looked fine.  It was such a nice day that we decided this would be great because of the patio and open windows.  Ugh.  Living in Vancouver, I forget that people are still allowed to smoke on patios.  Disgusting.  I absolutely do not want to smell someone's cigarette while I'm eating.  We ended up moving tables three times trying to get away from the cigarette smoke from outside.  

That being said, the server was totally cool and friendly with us wanting to move around.  The servers were also quite helpful in helping me find some vegan options on the menu, which I greatly appreciated.  I want to be clear that I never had an issue with the servers attitude or anything like that.  They were always quite friendly to us.  One of the servers did tell me that the falafel there is the best in the city.  If that's true, then Toronto falafel must taste like sewer water elsewhere.

I got the falafel plate and my boyfriend ordered the ceasar salad.  He was kind of stoked because usually there are anchovies in a ceasar salad (he's just vegetarian, not vegan like myself).  His salad looked really weird.  He said the dressing sort of just tasted like watery mayo and there was dried parmesan sprinkled all over the top - like that really cheap Kraft parmesan you get at the grocery store that's all powdery in the green container?  That stuff.  The \"bread crumbs\" were just pieces of wheat bread crust.  The lettuce looked fresh enough at least.

My falafal plate was such a disaster.  I kept thinking that if Gordon Ramsey walked in here, he would turn this place into one of those Kitchen Nightmares episodes.  The hummus was alright, but nothing to write home about.  Not much flavor, but not offensive at least.  The falafal was fried much too hot and too long.  It was burnt on the outside and still raw in the middle.  The grilled vegetables appeared to have been grilled many days before and taken directly out of the fridge.  They were cold and rubbery and I couldn't even force myself to eat them.  The couscous salad was passable, but dry with no flavor.  For some reason there was salsa in a bowl in the middle of the plate, too.  That was weird.  The eggplant salad was old, probably made a week or so before.  It was bland and oily and looked like it had been sitting around for a long time.  The pita bread was stale and burnt.  I could hear a loud noise when I banged the pita triangles on my plate!

To top all of this off, the server never once came back once we had our food.  I was drinking water and was only given a small glass, which I finished rather quickly.  It would have been nice to be able to say that at least I could get a refill of water after this horrific food.  

I have never had food this horrible before, especially not something that should be so easy.  After we left, we immediately found somewhere else to eat so we at least wouldn't be hungry for the rest of the day.  Yuck.  I would never, ever go back here again and I would never, ever recommend anyone to go here either."}
{"text":"Judy Perly, the owner of Free Times Cafe, stopped in her tracks when she saw me.  I glanced behind me.  No, it was definitely me who'd caused that response.

\"You,\" she said, inhaling deeply, \"look so much like an old friend of mine.\"  I got the impression that the friend was deceased---if she was a Catholic (like me), I'm almost certain she would've crossed herself---and I just sort of smiled and nodded.  She shook herself, took me to my table, asked me where I was from, and told me the history of \"Bella! Did Ya Eat?,\" Free Times' Sunday brunch, which is so named in honor of Judy's grandmother, who made sure everyone had a full plate.

I'm a vegetarian and was concerned about a potentially limited selection, but there were tons of veg-friendly food from which to choose.  The latkes, blintzes, and array of fresh fruits are amazing.  The coffee is good, the service is excellent, and the live, traditional Jewish music is so rad, I could barely stand it.  It's just a fun and upbeat place for brunch.  Come hungry and fill your plate with goodness.

Before I left, Judy stopped me again and asked, \"your name isn't Helena, is it?\"  I nearly shat myself.  \"What did you say??\" I said, grabbing her arm.  \"Your name isn't Irene, is it?\" she repeated, and I let out the breath I'd been holding.  That would've been just too uncanny."}

{"text":"Good service and large variety of items. I really like their chalah french toast, salmon patties and potato latkes.

Watch out for the fish items as some of them have bones."}
{"text":"BELLA, DID YA EAT?!

You know, being Jewish has its perks.  You get long, curly brown hair, a nice olive complexion, a good college education, and a childhood rife with the only kind of purgatory in which we believe: gastrointestinal.  Every holiday we get a dinner AND a brunch the next morning, complete with heaping platters of blintzes, lox, whitefish salad, bagels, smoked mackerel, olives, hummus, leftover brisket from the night before, fruit, herring, gefilte fish, coffee cake, and, if you're my aunt in Thornhill, Swedish meatballs.

Oy, such amounts of food.  Is it heaven?  Is it hell?  Who knows, we're Jews!

Unequivocally, of course, the hardest part of being Jewish is sitting on your hands and WAITING for these holidays to 'round the bend once more.  Thankfully, Free Times and old aunt Bella have made this hellish paradise available each and every Sunday for the moderate price of about $20/person with tip.  Hey, it's cheaper than med school."}

{"text":"Very nice and friendly place to hangout with friends.

It also great to host some events."}
{"text":"OK, so I've officially fallen in love with their All-Day Breakfast
For around $10 you get: 2 eggs, bacon, 2 latke's, bagel or toast, fresh fruit, and a salad.  
But wait there's more....it includes coffee!  Guaranteed to fill you up, and it's generally quite tasty.  It's also a bit cheaper before 11:30 AM.  5 stars for this.

Service is good.  The staff that work here is super sweet, although I've seen the owner yell at them a couple times, which wasn't so nice.  

I've been here a couple times for dinner/drinks.  it's generally good, but not quite as good as the breakfast.  Lots of fairly tasty Jewish/Middle Eastern items.  Always lots of daily specials too.  Generally a strong 4 stars.  

Nice patio too.  For some reason it's never completely full and people seem to sit inside often."}
{"text":"This was a fall-back for my friend and I for a Sunday brunch.  It's a small space, a little worn down, but has a patio.  We were there for the Bella!  Did you Eat? Sunday buffet.  The food was very good, and it comes with complimentary orange juice or coffee.  The space was small, and there was LIVE music when we were there.  We were there shortly after 11am, it was buzzing, but the crowd subsided by the time we left.  It started as a family-run business and still has that vibe.  You will be asked about how you enjoyed the food, and yes, they'll even chase after you and ask for your experience.  Would not necessarily return, but it was a good experience."}
{"text":"i've been here twice.  the first time, was good.  the service was great, decent food.  we went for a late dinner and there was music in the next room.  it made for an enjoyable evening. (4 stars)

the second time...the most recent time...we had a new waitress.  it was her first day serving and MAN, did everything take an extremely long time.  i think there were only two other tables, one had just ordered.  my friends and i saw a couple sit down, wait for awhile and then leave because no one came over to them.  we didn't complain or anything, i think we felt sorry for her, being it was her first day.  i don't think i want to list the things she forgot and did wrong.

the food was pretty good.  i think the best thing they serve here are the latkes.  browned to perfection.  all the other food is just a tiny bit better than pub/diner food.  this time, the food saved the waitress's tip and it's star rating. (2 stars)

i'll probably give this place another shot before i close my books to it.  it better be fantastic though..."}

The service is excellent: attentive and warm - a very welcoming place.. feels like home!"}
{"text":"On a recent girls night out we chose this destination for a few drinks before hitting an after party. I had seen this place literally packed everytime I drove by so I thought it might be interesting to try and suggested it. 

The place is a little on the small side but no doubt very quaint. It has a small patio located in the front which I'm sure would be nice over looking college on a busy summer afternoon. We sat at the window seat and ordered a pitcher of steam whistle it was on special I can't remember the price point now but it was affordable. We also ordered a pitcher of red sangria and it was delightfully fruity and fresh with a hint of sweetness; truthfully one of the best sangrias I have tried.

When we arrived we could hear some sort of event being held in the back hidden behind a curtain but after inquiring we found out they often host a variety of events from
Comedy, dance, book readings and more. A little tid bit of information that I would never have known had I not ventured in on this very date and time. Providence!

I will be returning here as I found the service refreshingly good and have not yet tried the food so a second visit is in order to sample their cuisine, expect a more detailed review update soon ;)"}
{"text":"Came here once upon an evening to join a few friends for dinner. We all chose the buffet because it smelled delicious and was well priced.

I stuffed my face with yummy latkes and blintzes. The rest of the food was not bad. Our server was nice and made sure our drinks were always topped up. At one point, even the owner swung by to see how we were doing.

All in all, my mind was not blown, BUT I did have a nice time. I would definitely come back for some more latkes and blintzes."}
{"text":"This weekend i went for Sunday Brunch to Free Times Cafe,which is owned by Jewish woman which was completely rude.

In the buffet was small cup of orange juices which i thought include in price, but not unfortunately... And i started to eat my 1 plate dish however she started to stair  to my table and told smth to her waitress to look after me. I get very upset from the ambiance over there and my suggestion if you want feel free and not staired on you you can go to Hot House restaurant which price is approximately is the same($22), for the brunch in Free Times Cafe($19.99)+gratuity. 
The food was just blintz, patotao pancakes, smoked salmon, again potato and bean salads, babganush, just 1 type of cheese, little bit fruits and eggs, instead in Hot House you can find variety of seafood, Meat, sweets, breads, fruits and etc."}

{"text":"I was introduced to this place by our monthly computer security enthusiast meets.  We generally meet on the patio, weather permitting, or in the dining area.  The food was well prepared, and the menu is extensive.  If you want kosher, mediterranean or americanized food, it's on the menu.  I haven't been there to see live music yet, as the back stage area feels a bit too pretentiously cliqued, and I was afraid for my life when I walked back there once and was confronted by a dozen staring bohemian vagrants who were upset that I'd interrupted their acoustic hero.  Sorry about that guys!

One thing must be said...  The gent serving the patio when I've been there is SUPERHUMAN.  Every beer I've ordered has been in my hands within 0.75 seconds of me ordering.  I swear it!  Beer selection is decent too."}
{"text":"Already craving another veggie burger from Free Times! SO good! I had mine with fried onions, guacamole and cheddar and it also comes with lettuce, red onion, tomato and a side of garlic mayo (amazing!) 

Another must try is their spiked cider - was perfect for the cold April weather we've been experiencing. 

I will definitely be back because there were so many other menu options I'd love to try! :)"}
{"text":"Nice brunch place. My server was really nice and helped me through the menu. Sweet patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Having read the other reviews, I'm feeling like perhaps I came on the wrong night.  That being said, my gripes aren't really crowd specific, so maybe I'm just more picky.

I came with my girlfriend after a day at work and was hoping for typical pub food.  I saw a sandwich board advertising a burger and beer deal for $10.95 and thought that was perfect.  Upon closer inspection, the beer was a half pint of their crappiest on tap brew (Amsterdam).  Still, I figured they'd charge me an extra $2 or something to get a full pint of something else.  That was not the case.  A pint of Amsterdam there is $4.95 and a burger is $9.95.  So they give away the first half of Amsterdam for $1.  That's not a bad deal.  When I asked about getting the second half of the pint (who drinks a half pint anyway?), the waitress informed me that it would be an additional $3.  All of a sudden, now the burger and beer deal saves me a whopping $0.95...not much of a special of the day if you ask me.

Already annoyed that it would cost me this much for a beer I don't even like, I decided that I would forget the Amsterdam and just get something I liked at full price.  The whole thing cost around $15 before tax, which is not outrageous, but I'd say a bit pricey for a plain burger.  I think $8 is more what the plain burger should be, 9$ for a cheeseburger and $10 for a deluxe burger.  At least those are the sort of values that popped into my head when I walked into the place, but their extra toppings were $1.35 each, which is absolutely outrageous.

My girlfriend got a california wrap, which was advertised to have sprouts in it, but instead was loaded with cucumbers (not advertised), which was strange, but she likes cucumbers so didn't complain.  She also got a can of guinness, which came already half poured.  It seems to me that if you get draft beer, it comes poured, but if you get a can, it should come in a can, not half poured.  That was bizarre.

The thing that tipped the scales to one star instead of two was when the burger finally came, I asked for Mayonnaise as any good Canadian would for his burger.  The waitress told me that Mayonnaise isn't a condiment like ketchup or mustard and would cost the extra $1.35 as an extra topping.  SERIOUSLY???  $1.35 for MAYONNAISE???  That almost deserves 0 stars for that alone.

Anyways, I'm droning on.  But seriously, it's College St.  Go somewhere else that's better and cheaper.  You'll thank me for it."}
{"text":"If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything.

 OK, so I'll start with the nice part. As a performance venue, Free Times has welcomed all kinds of acts to the city. From book readings to jazz concerts to the ever-popular Yiddish Cabaret theatre, Free Times has given a voice to all kinds of acts that don't fit easily into what can be a cliquey club scene.

 The space meanders between storefronts. The lighting is dim and the walls suitably grungy despite consistent attempts at upkeep, but Free Times is what it is: a defiantly bohemian watering hole/coffee shop for waves of U of T students taking their first steps along the path that Churchill described. \"if you're not a Liberal in your 20s, you have no heart. If you're not a Conservative in your 40s you have no brain\". Irony abounds, as newly minted hipsters wear their Che Guevara T-shirts and keffiyahs to chow down on old school Jewish favorites and Israeli fare. But then, if Fidel Castro can state his support for Israel, why can't a bunch of nascent Canadian lefties?

 So, Free Times has atmosphere in spades, even when you come back with a harder heart and softer brain. Wait staff are young, cute, artistic types. Easily flustered, but when they toss their hair back you don't mind that your plates are mixed up. There's a good selection of draft, and the coffee is free trade and fabulous. Given the crowd's student bent, you'll forgive FTC for limiting refill, or charging if you plan to hog a booth and watch the show. The blintzes are as close to homemade as you'll get here; crispy golden on the outside and sweet and creamy on the inside. Latkes are tiny and crunchy. Sided with blah applesauce, they owe a debt to the golden perfection that is the MsDonalds hashbrown.

 The Bella, Did You Eat??!!?? weekend brunch is a hoot if you like sing-alongs in dead languages. Sometimes, the entertainment is enthusiastic with the mic, leading to awkward call-and-response moments. The brunch presents classic opportunities for schednfreude, such as when the mic gets passed to non-Jews who foolishly wandered in off the street for bacon and eggs, or to multigenerational families. Middle-aged parents look uncomfortably at their parents, who return the look; these are kids who grew up thinking their parents spoke the mamaloshen perfectly, only to find out now that when used in song, nobody knows what the heck they're signing about. The frazzled owner tries to lead the room in a crash course in Yiddish culture, which is basically a series of variants on the theme of \"Oy\" ( \"Oy\", \"oy vey\", \"oy gevalt\"). Whether this is comedy or cultural exchange, it rests uneasily with the program as a whole, and sounds a slightly stereotypical note.

That is what Free Times does right.

On the other hand, dinner service is slow, awkward and often flat-out wrong. Dishes are sent to the wrong tables, orders incomplete, ingredients missing. The menu walks a thin line between \"eclectic\" and \"off-putting\"; loosely organized between standard Canadian bar food, Jewish European soul food, and quick-and-dirty Israeli cuisine. Hamburgers are cooked past dryness, although toppings are fresh. Middle Eastern offerings are well-intentioned, but one wonders how much experience the kitchen has with these ingredients; it's all overcooked, and the flavors are off compared to what you get further up Bathurst. Respectfully, there is also no excuse for charging over $10 for a plate of falafel, etc. This is street food, Israeli cucina di poveri. It's made from chick peas and sold to undergrads, for crying out loud.

A final note, Free Times has recently entered the smoked meat wars, perhaps out of concern over the emergence of Caplansky's Deli just a few doors down. You can see the merit of two different approaches to food and restaurant management. Caplanskys does very few things, but does them to the best of his ability. Nothing is wasted, as precious smokey brisket trimmings find new life in soups, gravies and knishes. It's all made fresh. Free Times offers a more ambitious menu, but their meat is brought in from XXX, direct from Montreal. Among hardcore montreal deli enthusiasts, this might be a selling point, but by now they've largely migrated up to Centre Street by the Promenade. Mall. Caplanskys relies on the fresh, local nature of its ingredients, which Free Times does as well, if more selectively (a more expensive, organic burger is testament to this attempt). Ever taken the six hour trip from Toronto? Know how it feels when you exit the car at the hotel? If not, try the cryovac smoked meat and you'll see what I mean."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5.  

I had a satisfying all day breakfast for $7.95 ($6.95 if you order before noon) which included coffee and friendly attentive service.  When the plate arrived it was, and looked full.  This is kind of a big deal for me as a) a person with a healthy appetite and b) a person who likes good value especially for food like eggs that I can easily make at home and c) that probably makes me like everyone else reading this review.

So back to the plate; two eggs over easy, two properly sized and righteously greasy latkes, a whole grain toasted bagel, four slices of back bacon, a little heap of green salad and three slices of fruit that didn't include mealy melons, and not much white plate showing.  Thumbs up.

We lucked out with great weather today and with the patio situated at the part of College with the super-wide sidewalks our three-stroller brigade had nice seats in the sun with minimal patio furniture rearranging necessary.  I noticed that a couple other tables were able to dine with their dogs sitting just outside the patio boundary and again with the wide sidewalk your pooch wouldn't get in anyone's way.

This is the same mom-group that went to Caplansky's a couple of weeks ago and we all agreed that today's experience was better.
So maybe more like a 3.75 star review.  I just can't give it a 4 which on my personal scale is, \"when's the next time I can go back?\"."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was walking by on my first night in town and thought it looked like a cute spot. I was traveling alone and planned on just drinking alone. But, the people at the bar were so friendly, I ended up hanging out with them all night!

I'll definitely come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I once worked at the Free Times Cafe for about 3 Sundays in a row, bussing the very busy and (I soon found out) mind-blowingly delicious Sunday Brunch extravaganza known as, \"Bella, did you eat?\" (the sweet and entertaining anecdote behind this name was offered by the owner to the crowd each time, so I will assume this is usually the case).

The employment didn't work out for scheduling conflicts with my other job, but the really awesome and helpful staff made the new kid (me) feel right at home, and the greatest part was that I was welcomed to enjoy the buffet to my heart's content once 3 o'clock or so rolled around. And that I did. A vast spread of largely Jewish cuisine, all of it delicious and homemade (I still remember placing the doilies under each bowl of food, which was a slight hassle but a nice touch which seemed to make perfect sense).

Oh, I was also very fond of the fact that the fresh-squeezed orange juice was free-flowing (very important to me). It's the kind of place I always want to take any out-of-towners in my possession, but sadly haven't managed to in awhile. That reminds me..."}

What this place teaches me about myself: I want to decorate my apartment like the dining room. Also i like their latkas"}

As far as service goes I've never had an issue...only pleasant and attentive staff.

This is the type of place you stumble upon by accident..total hidden gem. Very unassuming but worth your while 100%.. will keep coming back. Everyone I've introduced to this restaurant has fallen in love. There is a reason for that."}

{"text":"Cozy, down-home and (not to mention) TERRIFIC place for Sunday brunch! 

At Free Times, buffet style is the name of the game. And really, are there any sweeter words in the English language than \"all you can eat\"?

You're going to want to come hungry and adventurous, because this buffet has it all. Traditional Jewish favorites like Challah french toast, Montreal-style bagels, latkes, lox and smoked fish, but Mediterranean staples as well: hummus, chickpea salads, pickled veggies and falafel. There's also of course fruit and a huge dessert table, complete with baklava, rugelach and chocolate babka (my favorite). The buffet price also comes with a choice of unlimited juice, coffee or tea, and so for all that's included, it's a hell of a deal.  

The service is friendly and warm. We were well taken care of, but not fussed over. During our meal, the owner made the rounds talking to customers - most of whom, it seemed, were regulars of many years. Overall, we left stuffed and feeling like we'd just experienced an awesome family reunion. 

I had heard there's music at the brunch too, but we had to leave just before noon, and they were still setting up. I would definitely come back, and next time make a later reservation to catch it!"}
{"text":"yum to the yum!

I LOVE their latkes and occasionally crave these deep fried potato goodies.  Comes with apple sauce and smooth sour cream.  
I do need to caveat emptor you, dear reader, since if you order take out, these oily round latkes, will come out of the deep fryer SO HOT, that it will actually burn the styrofoam container.  I ordered a set of latkes yesterday and picked off the visible (slightly melted) styrofoam.  I eat latkes only occasionally and it's just another form of tasty comfort food, for me...   

Their coleslaw is also notable, but have that, with other foods (so the slaw isn't concentrated)... Flavourful non-shredded large pieces of marinated purple cabbage.

Their pea soup is lovely.

I've had their blintzes.  Also good, but I don't crave them.

They have an all-day breakfast for under $10.

tip: get on their mailing list.  Sometimes they send out discounted all-you-can-eat buffet prices.  Their reg. buffet price is around $20."}
{"text":"It's been forever since I've written anything on Yelp but as the Jewish New Year begins, I must recommit myself to write reviews when the service and experience are wonderful, so it's somewhat fitting that I begin with Free Times Cafe, a place that even your bubbe would love. 

We were visiting Toronto from New York and wanted to find a bagel and brunch place and according to the Yelp reviews we read this place would fit the bill perfectly.  The menu however offers so much more than eggs, lox, blintzes and latkes.   Mediterranean dishes were offered as well as great twists on aforementioned traditional Jewish foods.  

Eventually the owner came by as she was in the booth next to us and asked us about our meal.  We ended up talking to her for 20 minutes, she was incredibly nice and interesting.   Her warmth is reflected through the attitudes of the staff, who all seemed great.

We didn't see or hear any music but it looks like that happens in a room in the back...

Anyhow, when we visit Toronto again, we will be sure to come again."}
{"text":"Listen, Bella, I ate, and I went back for seconds.

So, I have to say that not only do I live around the corner from this and walk past it on a daily basis, it took me two years before I decided to actually go inside and order something. I find a lot of people do this. I wonder why.

Anyway, I went once for brunch, which was good, but not great. But good enough. It's a bit like if I decided to make brunch for myself and then decided I just wanted someone else to do it for me. The challah French toast didn't knock my socks off but it hit the spot.

I went back at 4 AM or so and ordered hot cider and wedge fries. That hit the spot. Order that.

In the back is a venue, and from I can tell it is a pretty nice one, but I am yet to go to a show. You should go to a show there and then write about it so I can decide if I want to go to a show there.

Either way, I always swoon when I read the menu and get to answer questions like \"What's a matzo ball?\" and grin when I see my comfort foods of latkes and hummus, but any place that serves bacon with EVERYTHING is not kosher. Did you catch that Yelp? This place is kosher style, but so am I.

PS All the waitresses here are really nice and cute and never make me feel bad for taking too long to order."}

We ordered the sangrias which came in these awesome flamingo cups and were very flavourful.

We then ordered the brisket poutine to share. It was amazing! I loved seeing all the Jewish foods on the menu like latkes, matzah ball soup, etc. Made me feel right at home!

I decided to try the brisket sandwich for my main. It was perfect.
