{"text":"I adore Cole Cafe! We recently moved to the area and consider this to be the \"local\" spot. Each time I have eaten here the owner comes out to chat and is very friendly. The food is always delicious!!! A great Pittsburgh Diner. Even if you're not a local it's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The absolute WORST experience of my life.  I thought nothing could be worst than the cold soup and dry sandwich plus the order of french fries (10) and greasy, but the waitress topped the food to add to the worst experience.  She was too busy talking with other help i practically waited on myself.  The soup was cold, the french fries were greasy and the tuna fish sandwich which by the way i was charged $7.95  was so dry i only ate half.  The help was awful.  I work hard for my money and this was the WORST PLACE to spend it.  Will NEVER GO BACK  YUCK1111"}
{"text":"First time here today for breakfast.  We ordered the corned beef hash with peppers and onions, and regular french toast.  
The standard french toast order is three pieces, and despite the warning about the portion size to my pint sized dining partner, we ordered the full serving.  The french toast was delicious, although a bit too much \"vanillaly\" as the youngster phrased her opinion.  
The hash was great as well, not overly greasy, and hot with just enough crunch on the browned bits of meat and potatoes.  The eggs were standard fare, scrambled and needing salt.
Our waitress was cheerful and kept the coffee cup full.
Overall a pleasant experience, and will return to try one of the abundant omelet options."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwichs are 6 bucks.  Consist of a bagel, piece of ham and slice if cheese. I did not get egg. Sandwich was probably $1.00 to make. Costs $6.00 plus tax to buy.  500% markup on a sammich."}
{"text":"I had the worst breakfast ever this morning at Cole Cafe. The kitchen lost our order.  Katie, the waitress, told us they were bumping up our order to the front and it shouldn't be that long.  After seeing four other tables get their food before us, I told Katie we were about to leave.  Two more tables got their food before we finally got ours.   Total wait time was 45 minutes!  My scrambled eggs were so over cooked they were inedible.  My husband got his toast after he finished his breakfast. No apology from the owner.  Katie told us we wouldn't have to pay for our meal. I told her I had no intention of paying for it anyway. She never checked on our breakfast or asked the kitchen staff where our food was.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and owners, very reasonable prices and simple but very good food. I never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the worst diner experiences I have had in quite a while. Terrible service and very overcooked eggs, sausage and home fries. The only thing edible was the toast. The busboy was waiting on tables because the help was too busy chatting to one another. 

I really was hoping for a better experience since I live nearby. I will stick to Kelly O's or Valiant's."}
{"text":"Have had breakfast here a couple dozen times. It's a diner atmosphere with a menu to match. I've had omelets, pancakes, waffles, ham-and-eggs, BLTs and a couple other items and have not been disappointed.  Home fries are fresh and you can get them with peppers and onions for an extra $1,  but the hashbrowns are McDonald's style. They have specials that aren't run-of-the-mill, such as thick-sliced cinnamon toast with a sweet sauce that was more yummy than I thought it would be. As you might expect in a place like this in Pittsburgh, you'll get a full plate of food.

A frequent special is \"ham off the bone\" which is a generous serving of carved baked ham with a couple eggs and your choice of potatoes. Great ham. 

Friendly waitresses who keep the coffee mug full. Kitchen open for breakfast and lunch only but they stay open later selling lottery tickets."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and was totally shocked! So delicious! I cannot believe I have never been here before! Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"have lived in Shaler for 8 years, and shop at the nextdoor Dollar Tree weekly, but never went to Cole Cafe.  Decided to stop in to get take out soup - ordered one Italian Wedding Soup and one made with Amish noodles and corn - but I can't remember the name.  Both were delicious.  And the gentleman who waited on me was one of those people that just seems to be a happy guy and who can make you feel good about the place -- I would definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"Excellent service friendly staff and the food is so fresh and delicious ! Will be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"ok place since nothing else is around. If there was any competition they would not last. 

Typical greasy spoon am breakfast place. Now they started charging for the home fries??What the heck? Never heard of that before which indicates to me they are really hurting for $$
Staff is pleasant"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Cole Cafe I was not completely satisfied.  I think because I just didn't order the right thing.  I think I just got an omelet and wasn't impressed.  Seriously, I don't even remember.  There was probably bacon...?  I do remember thinking I should have gone with one of the signature breakfasts and regretting that I didn't.  So I vowed to return.

And return I did.  This time for the Carved Ham from the Bone (one of the signature breakfasts).  It came with eggs, home fries and toast.  I don't always go for ham, but this was some good ham.  The whole breakfast was reasonably priced (I think around $8) and service is always friendly (though sometimes during peak can be slow).

For me, Cole Cafe is ideally located for breakfast with the folks so there's a pretty good chance I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Cole Cafe is the perfect little diner! The menu is simple and includes plenty of breakfast and lunch classics. There are also seasonal specials like pumpkin pancakes. Yum! I've has those several times. Everything here is quite good, and even the coffee is tasty. I particularly like their funky mugs with old advertisements on them. 

My mom lives half a mile from here, and before I graduated from college it was our tradition to come get breakfast on the last day of my holiday before I flew back to Chicago. The staff has always been very friendly to us and goes out of their way to make allowances for her wheat allergy. They are a large part of why Cole Cafe has a much nicer atmosphere than some of the diners closer to me in the city. I know I'll be coming back here on occasion as long as my mom lives in the north hills. It's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Love to order pick up breakfast and bring it home for breakfast in bed minus the clean up."}
{"text":"I've lived in Shaler all of my life and I've only just now visited the Cole Cafe. I can't believe I was even willing to admit that. It's kind of embarrassing! Anyway, my husband and I went here for a late breakfast after our afternoon plans fell through. It was your typical local diner, with old mismatched seating, reasonable prices, and friendly service. 

My husband ordered breakfast. He got eggs, chorizo, and potatoes. The chorizo looked homemade. You could tell the patties were handshaped and weren't pre-made frozen ones. 

I ordered a Pittsburgh Salad which is a common choice for me. I got the BBQ chicken on my salad and I liked that the BBQ sauce and Ranch dressing were both served on the side. It was also a nice portion size for the price. 

The server we had was very friendly and talked to us about the new iPhone operating system and how he also likes to drink coffee with a straw as my husband does. It's nice to see servers who are able to partake in casual conversation with customers.

I'd definitely go back again. It's a nice low-key place close to home where we can go for breakfast when we don't want to drive far or wait long."}
{"text":"This is an unassuming little place in an unassuming little strip of stores
Worn out beat down doesn't always mean poor food or service 
So despite its looks we decided to give Cole Cafe a try 
Booths and tables 
We are told sit anywhere 
Off to a good start restaurant is about half full
Cook busy working the grill right in front
Tired looking waitress with a forced smile takes our drink order
Unsweet ice tea & coffee
We order simple offerings 
Toast 
Grits 
A potato pancake which is featured on the menu
My bff ordered an omelette 
Drinks promptly arrive 
We sit 15 min 20 min we are engaged in conversation. I notice others leaving 
Mmmm where is our food
Waitress comes over in a totally void of emotion voice tells us she threw out our order... we ask ??? Apparently she threw out the page from her pad that she wrote our order on.
Ok so we repeat our order 
Long story long time
40 min later we said sorry we can't wait anymore 
A flippant sorry from another waitress 
And we are out the door never ever to return 
Ps of course we left enough money on the table for the coffee and tea"}
{"text":"Great place. Wish I lived closer so I could come here more often."}
{"text":"An update. Moving them from 4 stars to 5. Great  potato pancakes!  Delicious ham. Extremely friendly staff. Very helpful with my allergies. I'll be going back soon!"}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I've been to Cole Cafe, and I wasn't going to post anything, but then I saw that the Trib gave them the Gold Award for Best Hamburger. 

When I went there a few months ago, I ordered a burger. It's about $5-6 dollars, with no sides included, and they up charge for EVERYTHING. Cheese is $1 (which is understandable), but even lettuce and tomato were an additional 25 cents each, and plain raw onions were an additional 75 cents. They didn't inform me about the lettuce and tomato charges, and I only saw it after getting my check at the end of the meal (onions were mentioned on the menu, but it's still ridiculous to charge for that).  The person I was with got an omelet and asked for Italian bread, and they charged him an additional 20 cents (once again, we were never informed about this, just saw it on the check). 

I ordered a side of fries and they are unseasoned, plain frozen French fries you'd find in the grocery store.  I was given about 10-15 total. 

But the worst part about this all was that they gave me this hamburger on a stale, old bun. I couldn't even bite into it.  I was so disgusted I can't ever go back there. It looks like this place has good reviews and maybe my experience was not typical, but I had to warn others about it."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. I have not had a bad meal here in the 5+ years I have been going. Definitely worth giving a try if you are looking for breakfast."}
{"text":"Cole Cafe is your typical small town greasy spoon type diner.  Stopped in for breakfast and ordered a three egg omelet w/ green peppers, onions, and ham.  The quality of the food is what you would expect to make at home (which is a good thing).  They seem to use real ingredients which is nice.  My only complaint is that the green peppers were a little under cooked and hard.  If you are in the area, I would recommend stopping in for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This is a really nice cafe in the heart of Shaler. I really enjoyed my eggs and sausage. I made a few girlfriends here and we sat and chatted for hours. We did not feel rushed to leave nor did it seem like they were bothered. It was a really great staff and everything on the menu look really good."}
{"text":"What a lovely café! I ended up here because I dropped my car off at ziebart a mile down the road and the owner suggested this place. It felt homey and cozy. I walked to the back, sat down, and immediately someone came up to me to ask what I wanted to drink. I got plain coffee.

I scanned the menu and the peanut butter chocolate chip pancakes caught my eye so quickly. I ordered two with powdered sugar. I know someone makes them, but they came quick and they were huge. I smelled the sweetness coming off the pancakes. The lady asked me if I wanted one or two small containers of syrup. I went with one though it's nice to offer that choice.

Holy moly these pancakes are sinfully delicious! They're fluffy and I could see the chocolate and peanut butter chips. Oh man, what a treat! I'm embarrassed to say I polished off both pancakes! Now I'm full and happy. I'm impressed with the friendly service, laid back homey atmosphere, and the amazing pancakes. I must come back!"}
{"text":"I love the cole cafe. I always get a consistent awesome breakfast, and quick friendly service. I eat here quite often and would say it's my favorite diner in the north hills area. They always have good specials, and I love that I can almost always find a table and get in and out for breakfast in less than 30 min if I need to."}
{"text":"Cole Cafe is a quaint diner. It is very clean and the service is great. HOWEVER I gave it two stars because the food is overly priced and it is nothing special. It's not just the fact they they used no salt or pepper (I understand that because of health concerns) but there was no herbs or spices at all. I believe in second chances so we, my husband and I, went again the following week. My husband and I ordered sandwiches. Egg salad which was sloppy with no flavor and the white bread was chewy. The grilled ham with cheese was not grilled but toasted in a toaster. The egg salad sandwich alone costs $4.50. I had to order fries separately. I will say that their fries are perfect but I can do that at home. I'm sorry but having a quaint setting, great waitress and good fries isn't enough. The food needs to be good and an egg salad sandwich should NOT cost more than a carton of eggs."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Dee was wonderful and very accommodating- she was fast friendly and always there to top off my cup of coffee. I'll be visiting one last time this morning before flying back home. A lot to choose from- my only \"criticism\" would be that the portion size on some meals aren't as big as they should be. Other than that, this place is a home run!"}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant   I ever been to and the manager was the rudest person I ever talked to!!!  The food sucked and I will never come here again"}
{"text":"Their captain crunch French toast is phenomenal! The coffee is good as well and the nice people working there always ensure your cup is full."}
{"text":"A great diner to have breakfast.  The staff is friendly, and the coffee is good.  I always get the eggs and bacon, and it's always tasty."}
{"text":"A nice small diner with friendly staff. I got the spinach and feta omelette and added their ham off the bone. It was really good, but not worth the $2.25 up charge. I also got charged for swapping fruit for potatoes, even though I wasn't told it was extra. And for that I got 5 small pieces of fruit. 

The wife got her usual poached eggs, which were done perfect. She did say the cinnamon toast left a little to be desired as it was basically white bread with a \"touch\" of cinnamon. It may be ok for people who don't like sweet breads, but that ain't her. She got a sweet tooth. All in all the food was really good, just a tad over priced. We'd still go again."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Quick and pleasant service and great food.  More of a casual place for anyone.  Their potato pancakes are great and they have some nice options for omelets, eggs, pancakes, etc.  More of the usual breakfast diner food."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast spot on mt royal blvd. I've been wanting to try it for lunch but got a chance to get there for breakfast. It is a no frills, solid diner with some super staff members. One of the few places that has buckwheat pancakes so I had a pancake combo with 2 cakes, bacon and eggs. Eggs were solid and the bacon was cooked perfectly for me, not too crispy at all. Pancakes reminded me of a time when I would get them with my dad when I was a kid. Very tasty and the food is really a good price . Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed. Ps.... tasted the potato pancake and it was the bomb."}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast.  Their potato pancakes were really good."}
