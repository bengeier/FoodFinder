{"text":"This is an Americanized Chinese Fast Food place. There are a few Chen & Wok's that are not the 'Express' in Phoenix that will cook-to-order (after you order they cook it) but the menus are basically the same. The Orange Chicken at the 7th St. location is spicy = decent.  Chinese cuisine is mostly fresh vegetables (gai-lan, bok choy, spinach, long beans, bean sprouts, winter/bitter melons), very few deep fried items, very little to no sauce added, and don't come with broccoli. None of which you'll find here nor at the beloved Panda Express.  What I have found is a well made lo mein. Not wet or crispy, it's wokked up with slivers of carrots, onions, cabbage, and a bit of sugar. It's great with the House Special Chicken.  The House Special Chicken uses the usual deep-fried chicken pieces that sit in the heated bin for half of the dishes on the menu. They used to cook a separate batch right after you order it about 2 years ago but no more. :( But it's the garlic sauce with lots of green onion that makes this pretty tasty. A few drops of Sriracha makes it awesome sauce. The batter used on the chicken is medium in density and is usually very crispy.  The Teriyaki Chicken is stir fried without the breading and the chunks are tender and decent sized. The sauce is a little on the heavy side and there's lots of it.  I've had this a few times with a 2-item combo.  The beef with broccoli seems to be pretty typical. The beef had been tenderized a ton and a few times tasted more like beef jerky. The broccoli is stir fried to the point where it gets limpy but I don't ever remember seeing it look bad. The spicy beef is the same tenderized meat but with big chunks of green (and red?) pepper and onions. Not exactly spicy. Not exactly preferred.  I like the steamed white rice as it's not too sticky and not grainy/dry. But I will always get the lo mein instead. The crab puffs/rangoons are okay and are of a decent size and a lot come in an order. The egg rolls have changed in the last few years and haven't looked tryable.  I think the important thing is to have a peek behind the glass at the items sitting in the warmers and figure out what you think looks good.  It's usually quick counter service and it's got fast-food feel all around it. It's inexpensive. The tables are a bit close together. It's a part of a little strip mall North of an Albertsons. The entrance and main windows face East so it gets REALLY warm in there during the summer afternoons. And of course, beware of the light rail construction."}
{"text":"Walked in wasn't to impressed. Looked at the food, looked like it had been sitting for a while. No one was even there but two guys looking at me and my mom inappropriately & I turned around and walked out. Wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place.  Quick, fresh and delicious!  My only complaint is that they aren't open on Mondays."}
{"text":"This is delicious every single time. Me, my husband and grandma came in today around lunch time and it was super clean. The food looked (and tasted) delicious as always! And the portions are so generous. All three of us got 3 item plates, drinks and sides for around $30. We have enough food for like two more meals.  I love their chili cups also. Loyal customer for a few years right here. It's just been so long!!!"}
{"text":"Unimpressive... I'd rather go to Panda Express. I didn't even finish my food."}
{"text":"Two item combo with fried rice is $5.74 with tax. Good amount of food for the price. Much cheaper than Panda Exp.... It's around $7 for 2 item combo in Panda exp.   I have a strong stomach so i never gotten sick from eating the food from this place. Some of the negative voters had a bad experience with the food there.  Great place, wish i still lived near there. Now i live near Scottsdale. I only drop by this restaurant when my work take me near that part of town."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Very good price. Owner is super friendly especially to repeat customers. He recognizes my husband every time -- by name. Multiple dishes ready to serve. Fast service."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine recommended Chen Wok when my local favorite unexpectedly shut it's doors. I must say I was pleasantly surprised! Great food, great prices!"}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery, an hour and fourty minutes later no show.. so i called to complain the guy told me the guy already left just when i was going to ask a question he hung up me (how rude!) Another 35 minutes passes and again no show ..so i called  again to complain and this time he told me he didnt have my Phone number the driver got lost so he couldnt call us for directions."}
{"text":"Gotta love Chen Wok!  This place is FAR better than Kentucky Fried Panda (Panda Express)!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular at Chen Wok for over a year now. I've patiently sat on the sidelines and read some of the more negative reviews here on Yelp. And I finally couldn't hold my tongue any longer.  Is Chen Wok Panda Express? No. It's not. Chen Wok actually puts meat into their dishes that you don't have to use garden shears to eat. Chen Wok's meat is actually tender. Their veggies, like Panda's, are cut fresh daily. They do NOT use MSG, unlike Panda. And I can get a 3 item meal WITH 6 plump, overfilled crab/cream cheese puffs for UNDER $10.00!!!  Is it the best Chinese food? It's better, by far, than Panda Express...but not at all in the same league as Chicago and New York's China Town fare. But that's ok...we're in ARIZONA. And I'd much rather give my money to a locally owned business than Corporate Butt Weasels any day.  Items ordered off their menu are plentiful, tasty, price-worthy, and of a better quality than their Panda-like line AND they deliver! Which is especially awesome due to the light rail construction on 19th & Northern.  The folks behind the counter are also very nice. I've never had a bad experience with Chen Wok and I'll continue to eat there as long as I'm in the area.  Give them a chance. Your other alternative is Wahsun across the street...and it's a crap shoot as to whether they'll be open or not."}
{"text":"I had some hope for this place.  It was clean and smelled good.  It's essentially Panda Express and the prices are reasonable.  For a quick lunch I got some Lo Mien with Beef & Broccoli and Kung Pao Chicken.  The food tasted exactly as I would have expected, kind of bland.  I ate about half of the meal and tossed the rest in the fridge for later.  Two hours later I felt something, something dark and painful.  This stuff RIPPED my stomach up.  Being at work, this made for some awkward meetings, that's for sure.  It could be that I have a delicate stomach, but I don't think I'd chance it again."}
{"text":"If you like sweet and sour chicken this is your place!!! The one item bowl is a must have, and the beef and brocolli is a eyebrow raiser as well. With a friendly staff behind in the kitchen wanting to make sure you are taken care of, Chen Wok has been a favorite of friends and family for years. Whether your short on time, or need a quick sit down place, make sure to give Chen Wok a shot!"}
{"text":"This place was a disaster when I came in a year ago, but maybe it was an off day. I've been twice recently--once, we got carry out, and the other day, we ate in. The kung pao chicken is out of this world, and the lo mein is good...and, be warned, the spicy beef is REALLY FREAKIN' SPICY.  The woman behind the counter isn't particularly friendly, but at least she's not rude. Crab puffs are excellent. Best of all, a one item bowl is only $3.95. You can't beat that."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place.  I always order to go, or for delivery and they make it fresh.  The crab puffs are my favorite, and the House Special fried rice is perfect.  Plenty of meat included.  Tell Johnny hello when you go in, or order for delivery.  He will treat you right."}
{"text":"The person that answered the phone and took my order was really polite and made sure to get all the info correct. Delivery was fast. Delivery driver was very polite and friendly. The food was great. I got the lemon chicken , crab puffs and egg flower soup. The soup was alright (I'm super picky about my egg flower soup) everything else was absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Only place I will order delivery from. I've been ordering from you guys for four years now. The food is delicious. They tend to get busy on weekend so they take longer to deliver, but they are worth the wait. Best Chinese food ever!!"}
{"text":"Another great meal from these guys! Johnny is the best! He always gets our food here while it's still hot.  My house isn't easy to find so we love that Johnny remembers where we are!! Thanks Johnny and all the team!"}
{"text":"Called to order for delivery.   Restaurant is 2 miles away.  Very unprofessional,  answered the phone gave them my address and told me They didn't delivered on my area.  Just hung up before I could ask for pick up."}
{"text":"A coworker said to me, \"hey lets get some Chinese\". Why not, I had no idea it was going to be this good. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, it was spicy and awesome, great flavors. This is probably the best thing I have eaten all month, best $6.50 I ever spent."}
{"text":"it's really hard to find chinese food that does it right considering sooo many places do the same dishes DIFFERENTLY. i'm also from MA where (IMO) there's a lot of good choices for chinese food, esp since there's a chinatown there. so when i moved to AZ in 2011, i struggled w/ finding a good chinese food place, i was beginning to think it was hopeless and i'd have to only eat chinese food a couple times a yr when i went home to boston lol. keep in mind i'm chinese american and NEED chinese food to live!!! anyway, while i wish this place did all my fave dishes exactly how i love  em, the way they do em is good enuf lol, better than other places, that's for sure! my husband and i ordered from them tonite for dinner, my part of the order was the dumplings (i LOVE the dumplings and order em in every chinese place i go to!), wor wonton soup (this was my 1st time trying theirs. it's not how i like it, but it was decent enuf), chicken lo mein (IMO, they do it good), and house special fried rice (yum :)) my husband got a combo plate.. really, it's good cheap prices for a good amount of food w/ plenty for leftovers! so how can ya go wrong w/ that? :) they'd get 5 stars from me if they did my dishes to perfection lol :)"}
{"text":"Omg. I had a bad tooth ache and so i just wanted soup, this was fresh (I got to actually see him make everything), and it was delicious. The food for the quick pick line was really good too. Im definitely coming back. That egg drop soup was the best I have had. Yumm!!"}
{"text":"Usually my food from here is pretty good, I only had one bad batch. The only place where I  can get Chinese food that's more so close to home Chinese restaurant. The lady is always  so nice when I call In. And if you tell him extra soy sauce they sure enough will give you extra soy sauce believe me and put plates and forks in there for you also!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since it was \"off the grill\" which closed up shop.  The owners were always nice and gave me so much food they had to tape the boxes up.  Well last week I spent 50 bucks (includes a generous tip) on a delivery and wound up on the toilet all night as well as vomiting into a Macy's bag.  Nothing quite like that extreme terror of which end is more important.  The sweet an sour chicken tasted \"off\" to me but I shrugged it off since I usually get orange chicken, I thought maybe sweet and sour wasn't my thing.  Man...never again.  Too bad, I used to enjoy this place but the service and quality of food has gone down."}
{"text":"Cheap Americanized Chinese food. The Two entree meal is more than enough to get me through lunch/dinner with extra to save for later. This place was one of the handful of fast food restaurants that got me through my college years in Phoenix. You can do half rice and half noodles if you can't decide on either of the two as your starch. Orange chicken, and sweet and sour pork are my faves. Swing by C Dub for a quick meal that will fill you up without leaving your pockets empty."}
{"text":"I ordered my food at 7:30pm I was told 45 mins. The restaurant is 5 mins from my house. At 8:45pm I called to see what is going on and the woman who answered told me he just left. And then proceeded to tell me that she had informed me that it could take up to an hour. She did not mention it could take up to an hour if I had known I would of canceled my order.   I ordered from here because it was close and my father had to leave for work. It is now 9pm and I still have no food. Horrible service and will not order from here again."}
{"text":"This place has great fresh affordable food! The one item bowl is LOADED with food! And for only $4 it can't be beat! I've had the Orange Chicken and Mushroom Chicken. Both were great dishes. I loved the lo mein. My favorite are the crab puffs! They are extremely hot. So allow some time to cool. I love this place and will be back ASAP."}
{"text":"Omgeeeee me and my husband love the chicken fried rice and the teriyaki chicken and crab puffs they are soooooooo good and they delivered to our home wow amazing service food was hot and fresh our first time trying there food I will definitely our again"}
{"text":"Love the food we ate here 3 times last week my son is a very picky eater but loves the sweet and sour chicken and lo mein friendly service we will keep going back to help support a local spot and for the yummy food"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have had take out at Chen Wok on seventh street and I would know what to expect. However Chen Wok express is another creature of it's own with trays of food ready to be dished into containers or a plate. Beware of food that just sits out. The eggs rolls were not edible it had an overwhelming \"porky smell and taste\". Was it the oil? Old dark pork meat? OMG. Next the orange chicken again the taste of old oil and more batter then chicken. Another case of dark mixed in with white meat-not good. The sauce was overly sweet and could not mask the taste. Last but not least chicken lo mean it was made fresh in the wok and not off the line. The Lo main was overly oily and the chicken pieces were gristly. Thirty dollars in the garbage.  This restaurant will only hurt your chain."}
{"text":"I can see why some people would enjoy this place. To each their own. I've tried it about 3 times and couldn't see the appeal. Portions are big but at the price of freshness. Fried foods just don't age very well, and at the slow turnover rate of their offerings, you'd think it'd make more sense to cook smaller batches more often than letting them sit in sauces until the crunch and texture disappear into the overcooked &  overbattered mush they become.   Also, steamed veggies are extra. Panda express is better. Sorry."}
{"text":"I came here because I was craving Chinese and didn't feel like going to Panda Express. Wanted something quick and close, and I've eaten here one other time, so I gave it a shot.    The food is okay, and the place try's to present itself like a Panda express.  They have crab Rangoon, and it's set up where you can get a variety of different things. The food is okay and the prices are good, but the last time I came here the service was awful.  The guy was filling to go orders while a line grew like 5 people long. I didn't mind, but he was sorta crabby when he waited on me and I had to tell him I wanted orange chicken like 3 times.  The food was okay, but nothing spectacular.  He also had a hard time making change when he rang up my order.  My bill was $6.77, so I gave him $10.02 so I could get $3.75 back. He was confused and tried to say something back to me.  The other lady working came and helped him figure out how to ring up my order.  I don't mean to suggest that he's stupid, but after his crappy demeanor, and now he can't figure out change, maybe waiting on people isn't the best idea for him.  Overall it was okay. With all the light rail construction, I went here because it's literally across the street from my apartment, and I wanted something quick. If you want better Chinese, go to panda express.  The food isn't bad, it's just not great...and questionable service as well."}
{"text":"Solid stuff. Portions were generous for the price and the quality of food was a bit better than I expected. Service was good. Place is kind of an in and out sort of joint but the food reflects that of hole in the wall Chinese in the Midwest. Sweet and sour chicken was crunchy and savory, not too dry and covered perfectly. Spicy sauteed beef was good too, succulent and the vegetables thrown in didnt lose their firm texture while sitting. I can not attest to exactly how often they swap out their food for fresh pans but in my visit there, my food was relatively fresh. Its a solid three stars for what it is and one must also take into account that the freshness from the express line could very well be hit or miss. I recommend getting food made to order. Wonderous things can happen under the right circumstances. Doesn't say much about their consistency, but inconsistency is a norm in these low-tier Chinese establishments."}
{"text":"Ran in here 10 min before closing time hoping there was some food left so I wouldn't have to go to McDonald's. While many places would be groaning since it was so close to closing time, they welcomed me in. I needed 4 orders, plus crab puffs. They cooked it all fresh on the spot with a smile on their faces. Haven't tasted it yet, but the food looks and smells good, my kids are happy, and I don't have to eat McDonalds. Win! Only bummer was that when I got home I realized that we were shorted my crab puffs. So disappointed. And since they are closed now, I won't get them tonight. :-("}
{"text":"This place has the best crab puffs around. They are stuffed and good price. The customer service was great. They were very respectful and helpful. The food was delicious. I loved the portions they served. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very scary in the inside. They have an open kitchen where you can see everything that goes on, it's kinda bad. The layout is kinda like panda where you can pick out what you like. The food is alright but greasy. I only ate half of my lunch. Kinda disappointed. For anyone that wants Asian food...if there's no Asians eating there, it's probably not great."}
{"text":"I love this place. The gentleman who does delivers is quite friendly. The food is always fresh when you order and they have never given me any problems whether I am getting delivery or dine in.  They also have a great variety of food available. Delivery is pretty quick compared to other delivery places. They don't skimp out when serving either. I think its a great deal and they have coupons available online."}
{"text":"Tried to give this place a chance. Dirty, dreary \"atmosphere,\" hurried \"staff (1 person).\" Prices are good.  The beef broccoli had a mushroomy, off-putting flavor.  I don't know how anyone can screw up orange chicken so badly,  but they managed. They do have good root beer,  though."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying iv been coming here for years. N only had maybe 2 problems in about a 5 year spand. Once i order delivery took them 2 hours n i lived seriously across the way from them 5 mins max! And the 2nd problem was there was a black long hair in my orange chicken n i called to complain and the lady that took my order (speaking fine english) acts like she doesnt understand english.... the man did bring me another orange chicken free of cost n hair. But now i call in for pick up iv tried maybe 4 times last week to call in n order two bowls same thing n they always have this out under the lights made already. I call when im about 20 to 15 mins away. Asking them every single time can u PLEASE have my order ready so i can grab n go back to work in time.. but no every single time iv been in there to pick it up NOTHING is ready the bowls arent even out!! And the lady that is supposed to be making it. Is eating at the table just eating n looking at me!! Wtf is this.. kind of customer service i come here alot and to be treated like just another random person walking in.. n oh let me say every single time i tell them to please have it ready on the phone they rush me off saying they will have it ready. Dont get me started on the old food sitting out that the lo mein start making a hard shell over the soft ones (from sittin under a light too long)"}
