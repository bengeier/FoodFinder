{"text":"I believe this is a stripper bar. My friends and I (two males) did not know that. We thought it was just a bar. So, we walked in. We wondered why we were getting so many stares, then, as I opened the door and spotted a woman swinging around a pole, we understood. All three of us ran to the car. Please don't think they are wimps; it is just they were not expecting dancers and were with me. It was horrifying. No wonder the men were eyeing me in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Heard it was under new management so hubby and I went to check it out and to see the comedy show. What a disappointment! Place looks like a dive, soda for mixed drinks came out of a bottle which was flat, which by the way I still had to pay for, and food menu was a joke. Not going to stay in busines long when you let your employees drink behind the bar."}
{"text":"This place isn't even worthy of a star. Yes, it's still open but don't go. It's nasty!  We pulled in and I had a creepy feeling! Sure enough we walked in and there were two guys and three woman all were staring at us like we were the freaks.  We bought a beer and got the hell outta dodge! Not a cool place at all, women were nasty! Not worth anyone's time! Oh and the beers were $3.75 for a bottle of Bud Light! We went elsewhere and bought a pitcher for 6 bucks!"}
{"text":"The Dome was an awesome place. I had a couple of really good times there. It was shaped like a giant dome, kind of like the Thunderdome. The table dances were negotiable. I never encountered that before or after the dome. There was only a couple people in there each time."}
