{"text":"Went to U Name it for lunch today and I must say the best food ever. Tonya and her Husband are friendly and the food is amazing. Restaurant is very clean. Welcome to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'll definitely say this food is absolutely delicious and the owners are super nice and if you have a question bout any of the food they will let you sample it. They make this sweet spicy sauce that they put on the wings and the Philly cheesesteak it's absolutely amazing I would recommend this place to anyone not only because the food is good but the hospitality that you receive is outta this world amazing. You can't sit down and eat it's not that type of establishment but the food is always nice and hot when you get it home and they cook the food in front of you so it's always fresh!"}
{"text":"You might not even see U Name It when you are driving by, it's on the end of a tiny, shopping center near Remount Road and the sign out front looked twisted, but I was on a mission today, so I found it!

I didn't know what to expect, I thought it might be soul food, but it is wings, burgers and dogs.  I can dig it. I ordered wings and french fries.  Sadly it's just a counter with a few bar stools, so really nowhere to eat.  

The wings were sweet chili hot wings and my french fries were smoking hot!  I mean, U Can't Touch This HOT.  U Name It knows how to make a girl happy!!"}
