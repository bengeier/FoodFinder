{"text":"They have a great breakfast special for $3. Meat is extra. Food is good.  Service is generally good as well"}
{"text":"Great place for the whole family ! wings are great! atmosphere is really cool and a fantastic staff"}
{"text":"Not a great place.   First off the place was cold and dirty looking.  Bathrooms were disgusting.  Tried to get a seat away from the windows and was told there was a larger party coming in and the back area was going to be full.  Needless to say we didn't see this large party during our visit.   Food wasn't great.  Pretty sure nothing was fresh just microwaved.  And cold food as well.   Service was bad as the waitress couldn't tell us the special.   And she couldn't remember our order when we asked for two separate bills for each couple there.    This place has been many different restaurants and they all have been bad."}
{"text":"Food is okay here. If you're going when there's a deal on like Friday evening half priced entrees than it's worth it. Good value for money"}
{"text":"I went here last year to watch the Mayweather fight. Last minute decision had me venturing out to the burbs and Im glad I did. This place is severly  underated. Ample Parking, The food was delicious, flavourful and a good portion size and the drinks were really good. Not too sweet not too strong. The bathroom was kept clean. The servers were consistent and attentive."}
{"text":"I'll have you all know that I am not a particularly violent person, but after return from this eatery establishment I mercilessly beat my children to vent the frustrations that I endured from this restaurant.  I waited 6 minutes to be seated which was TOO DAMN LONG! The food was merely acceptable when it took TWELVE WHOLE MINUTES FOR THE FOOD TO ARRIVE. I almost starved. #DoNotRecommend"}
{"text":"Great nachos! potatoe skins could use more effort than a few pieces of bacon and some cheese. We will be back as the drink specials are great"}
{"text":"Great location, I liked it when it was the previous chain.  Still like the atmosphere.  Always enough seating.  Went during the Jays playoffs, and they were couldn't handle the amoutn of people.  food was late and some things ignored.  Servers tried their best, but aren't used to large crowds.  Food is decent and their promos are awesome prices.  I'd go again, but not during peak times."}
{"text":"Talk about a bad location.  This restaurant is located in an outlet mall surrounded by furniture stores and other discount clothing stores with no visible signage from any main road.  We happened to be in this Pickering outlet mall visiting a lighting store when we accidentally stumbled upon this place.  It was late Saturday afternoon and after unsuccessful afternoon of shopping for home decor items, this place seemed like a good place to stop in to unwind.  The Courtyard claims to be a \"casual dining and pub\" establishment so we decided to order a pint of MGD and Kronenberg each and try out the quintessential pub fare of burgers and wings.  My husband ordered a burger with bacon, sauteed onions and cheese and I ordered a pound of cajun dusted wings with their suicide hot sauce on the side.  Our beers arrived refreshingly cold with perfect carbonation.  As we sat and watched the beginning of the leafs game, our food arrived.  The wings were a good size (8 in a lbs order), deep-fried and dusted with well balanced cajun dusting that tasted of herbs and spices.  The wings could have used more dusting but I prefer my wings to be slightly under-seasoned as I'm trying to avoid intaking too much sodium.   The suicide hot sauce was a little hotter than most suicide sauces I've tried at other wing joints.  If you can imagine a cross between St. Louis' hotter than hell and Duff's Armageddon, that would be The Courtyard's suicide sauce.  So far, I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.  My husband's burger was a towering monster stacked with a good 1/3 lb patty (from what I could see) with  nicely melted cheddar, mounds of sauteed mushrooms and the usual condiments of lettuce, red onions, a slice of tomato and a pickle on a soft kaiser bun.  Although the patty was cooked to more than medium well, the burger was still juicy.  All the condiments complimented each other very nicely and the burger was definitely one of the better ones I've had in recent years.  The fries were a bit of a disappointment in comparison (a lot like the old KFC fries) but all in all, the food was very good.  Too bad their ho-hum location had only managed to fill barely half the restaurant on a Saturday evening with a leaf's game on.  I do hope this place will stay in business so I guess I'll be going back there soon."}
{"text":"Atmosphere lacking big time.  We were seated close to the drafty door even though the place wasn't that busy on a Friday night at dinnertime.  There was no music playing???  Strange.  Our waitress was extremely low energy, not very welcoming.  We ordered 3 entrees for 4 people (2 adults, 2 kids).  One of the entrees was chicken strips with fries--instead we ended up with chicken \"dinos\" which were preformed, dinosaur shaped nuggets.  When we pointed out the error, we were offered an apology but not a solution to the problem.  The Hawaiian pizza was not bad and the tuscan chicken wrap was passable although it was a bit dry and lacking something. I can safely say we won't be back.  Too bad, I've heard that the chicken curry is very good..."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots. I have yet to be disappointed with any dish I have tried. Their home made soups are amazing. My favourite meal is the Grilled Mediterranean Salad with steak. The steak is always cooked to perfection and tender. The whole salad is served in an edible bowl freshly made.  I can also vouch for the French Fries, Cheese Burgers and Breakfasts. Their portion size is large, so you get quality and quantity. The staff is friendly, efficient and have a lot of patience.  They have daily specials including Sunday which is 40% off for seniors. You can't buy groceries that inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Wife and I came here for dinner today.  We are looking for a new pub closer where we live. We were a bit worried on entering the parking lot, the pub is located in a area full of retail stores.   However, once we arrived we were pleasantly greeted and seated quickly.  The pub is clean and there are a lot of TVs to watch the game. I opted for the wing special ($9 for a pint and a pound of wings) my wife got the chicken parm dinner.  The service was quick and the food was really good.  The wings were perfect and a steal for 9bux.  My draught was also great.  My wife was very happy with her dinner.  They seem to run really good specials we will be back to try more of the food.  I'll be back with the boys for drinks and the game.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Visited here for lunch. Service was prompt, friendly, and welcoming. The wings were huge. I had the suicide and it was truly hot, not vinegar tasting like most places. My two young sons also enjoyed their meals. One had nachos and the other had the kids wings.   The fries are great too. This is a much better place than Portly Piper, which is in Ajax."}
