{"text":"Simply a fantastic cheesesteak shop.  If you're in Kent, do yourself a favor and try it out."}
{"text":"just ordered for the first time today for lunch for my boyfriend and i. i must say by far the WORSE service ever they told me 45 minutes and it was a hour before i recieved my food and it was cold. mind you we only work like 5-8 minutes from the \"steak-eez\" location, absolutely no reason it shouldve been as late as it was. they were supposed to deliver to my boyfriends work first and delivered mine instead. we only have a set time for lunch and was highly dissappointed that i spent my lunch without food and had to eat while i worked because it arrived so late. NEVER AGAIN WILL WE GET THIS FOOD. dont recommend anyone getting delivery. EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"So having lived for a time just outside of Philly, I'm on a constant search for a good cheese steak and quite frankly most places in Ohio are a huge let down. My wife and I done in downtown Kent quite often and have probably passed this place a 100 times. But frankly from the outside it doesn't look like much and since there is a lot of competition in Kent we have never stopped in.

Well for Father's Day my beautiful bride, who knows full well about my quest for a good cheesesteak suggested we try this place, why not she was buying . Upon stepping inside I could not have been more surprised the inside was small but clean and actually pretty quaint. The cheesesteaks were actually quite good, I'm of the white cheeses (provolone, white Americans ) are the only options group and low and behold that was an option. The fries were fresh cut and perfect and although not the Philly cheese steak of my memory (which is probably of mythic proportions by now lol) but was pretty damn tasty. The best part their prices are really cheap. I will definitely be adding this to my lunch spot list."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped her before a class that he takes in the area. It is pretty straightforward cheesesteak joint. 

The staff was super friendly and helpful. I always appreciate it when college kids are cool with my little guy and treat him like a valued customer. 

Food was good. Fresh fries are always hard. They need to double fry them - they were soggy. There were hovever, a lot of them. 

We each had the half sandwich and fries for only $4.99. After a drink to split, we landed at just over $10. 

The steak sandwich was pretty good. Not exceptional, but I would go back. 

Stopped in the bathroom on the way out and it was super clean. 

When it Kent, stop in for quick and cheap lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Our first visit was today. I got the original with provolone and my husband got one with Wizz. I also ordered cheese fries and he ordered plain. What a disappointment! My sandwich had one slice of cheese and the meat was flavorless. My husband had a generous amount of cheese Wizz and he said it was quite good. And to cap it all off, there was no cheese on my cheese fries.  And we were the only customers in the place. So sad."}
