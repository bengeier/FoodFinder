{"text":"I consider it a blessing to have a Eden's Market in the neighborhood. The location Uptown is perfect, and as a business it blends into the mix nicely. It's a great source for local beef, poultry, pork, eggs, milk and a whole variety of other items, and the prices are fair for what they offer in terms of quality and convenience. 

I read the negative comments about the owners. But I have always found them to be friendly and helpful. They've even special ordered items for me.  Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for negative stars as I would certainly choose that.  I first experienced their rudeness a few months ago when I stopped in for something to drink.  Person working never looked up from the laptop to welcome me in.  Didn't tell me the price just stuck their hand out for the money and didn't thank me.  Although I vowed never to go back, alas and unfortunately I did.
I needed to buy Arborio rice for a risotto dish and since I work in the area, I stopped in to buy it.  When I arrived home I realized the rice expired almost 6 months ago!!  I was not going to be out $9 for a bag of expired rice, so I went in to return it.  I falsely assumed since they were a small business that it would be a nice experience.  I wish I would have recorded it for all to see. When I walked in, there was a person at the counter who I thought was a customer, but was not, and about 4 people behind the counter.
The rude worker at the counter wouldn't move for me to put the bag of overpriced expired rice down, and the other people just looked at me.  
So I advised I needed to return it due to the expiration date.  They decided they were going to use this to teach one of them how to do a refund.  Whatever.  I heard them say to each other that it's store credit.  Wait what?
I said I shouldn't have to take store credit for an EXPIRED bag of rice.  The ride person at the counter took her finger and pointed in front of my face at the sign that said no refunds.  I advised again that I wanted money back for an expired product.  They all started SHOUTING at me.  The one lady shouted to another person SHUT UP.  I do not know if this was directed towards me or a co-worker, but either way, it was so unprofessional and crazy.
I told them to give the store credit to someone else and proceeded to walk out.  As I was walking out. they were screaming at me that the rice was STILL GOOD.  That it was OK to use an expired product.
I cannot believe the lack of customer service I experienced.  I put it on my facebook page to spread the word never to shop here and within minutes received the following replies from my friends:
They were extremely rude to me as well!
Same Experience! Terrible small business owners. I would rather support them but they give me every reason to drive to Whole Foods and Fresh Market.

Spread the word about this horrible place that sells expired food and yells at you for not wanting it."}
{"text":"This is an excellent little neighborhood store. While they are a certified gluten-free proprietor with a vast array of products, and that is what they promote themselves as, they are also an excellent resource for local products and that cannot be overlooked. 

If you are someone who loves buying and eating local, then you'll find an excellent selection here (as long as the products don't conflict with their gluten-free system). They sell local milk, eggs, cheese and other dairy products, as well as locally grown poultry, pork and beef and even freshly made gluten-free desserts. Some of their dried goods are also local, including spices and local honey (which is important as it provides you with local allergen immunities that storebought honey from say, Brazil, is worthless for).

They also have a lot of really rare and hard-to-find products, both gluten-free and international, that I have never seen at even places like the Market District. Sometimes I go into the store just to browse, because I swear I see something new every time I'm there. They carry some important gluten-free, vegan and Paleo brands, so they are meeting the needs of a wide variety of niche eaters.

The owners are highly knowledgeable about their products, especially their whole food vitamins and the nutrition-based holistic section of their store. While they have a sign clearly displayed that says they do not diagnose anyone, their recommendations are spot-on because they know their products so well. If you go in to the store looking for say, something to ease your leg cramps or upset stomach, they can easily direct you to the vitamins that are going to best meet your needs.

In this regard the store reminds me of an old-fashioned pharmacy or general store - the owners will tell you the right answer, not always the answer you want to hear. They are very nice but they know their material front to back, so if you are mistaken about something they are not shy about correcting you. They have so much knowledge and if you ask, they are happy to share it with you.

Also, I saw a review about issues with expiration dates. I can understand how a tiny store, with such a wide variety of products, can find itself running into issues with turning over product fast enough. This is why big box grocery stores often limit themselves to just the major products. I think Eden's Market has been trying to figure this out for a while now, and recently they started a clearance rack in the corner where just-expired products are sold off on the cheap. This works out well for me, because I can get great, hard-to-find stuff that I know is still perfectly fine at a heavy discount I wouldn't be able to get elsewhere.

In short, this store is an excellent resource in the South Hills for not just gluten-free foods, but vegan, sugar-free, Paleo, local and other specialty products.

P.S. - There is a parking lot across the street and a parking garage half a block away. Their building is literally next door to the Mt. Lebanon T stop and there's a bus stop and commuter's parking lot there too. So this is an easy place to get to by foot or car, and also is easy to access via trolley or bus."}
{"text":"PI play lottery numbers at Edens Today I played numbers and he made a mistake I told him the number 3 times and he still got it wrong. I asked him to fix it and he said,\"You should have filled a card out\".I have never filled out a card here and no one else has. I asked him to fix and pay for the mistake. He stated no and got very rude. I told him I was going to call the lottery which I did. The guy at Edema then threw me out. Watch out for lottery mistakes. Tks Unhappy Air Force Veteran."}
{"text":"Aw - I love this place and I'm excited to write the first review for it.

If you're looking for gluten free, sugar free, dairy free, unprocessed snacks and food - come to Eden's Market.

Eden's Market carries a wealth of exceptional gluten free goods, organic beauty finds, supplements, and much more.

The owner is a Celiac - so he in invested in making sure that not one of the items in his store contains gluten and he is passionate about spreading awareness about whole and healthy foods. 

The owner is often at the store and if you have any questions in regards to health or about any of the products in the store - he is extremely helpful and offers invaluable personalized service in helping you find what you need.

I was beyond impressed at the selection at Eden's Market and found the selection to be more substantial and more affordable than most San Francisco health stores.

I picked up a couple of packets of Brad's Raw Veggie Chips, some Kale Chips and a number of other coveted finds here. I wanted to buy everything in the store.

Mount Lebanon obviously knows what's up when it comes to healthy local gems such as Eden's.

Trust."}
{"text":"My children and I love this store.  We all have issues with food.  I have Celiac's and the kids have Eosinophilic Esophagitus.  They cannot have any of the 8 common allergens.  Eden's Market finds us food that the kids CAN have since their options are so limited.  They often order specialty food for us that they may not always carry in the store.

Jeff and Susan are very knowledgeable about their products.  They carry some of the best supplements that are food based.  These are much better than chemical supplements.  They will both guide you on your journey of understanding what you can and cannot have if you have allergies.

I love getting great deals from their half off shelf.  Yes, the items may say best used by a date that just passed.  These items are a great way to save money and still have great quality.  I have never purchased a bad item from their sale shelf."}
