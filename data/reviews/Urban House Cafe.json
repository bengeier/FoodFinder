{"text":"My favorite neighbourhood gem. The best prices for food and booze in the area - always open late, and they have great specials (although the prices have been recently raised they are still unbeatable). The food isn't spectacular but you can't complain for the prices. Super friendly service, great patio, and very unpretentious."}
{"text":"Awful!   Didn't get what I ordered.  They didn't bother to tell me they were out of stock until after everyone had their food.    I changed my order and they waited half an hour before telling me they couldn't get it to me as everyone else had finished eating.  They weren't prepared and didn't end up serving me at all."}
{"text":"Love this place, I've come here for my birthday two years in a row. The staff is always amazingly friendly, I feel very welcome and comfortable in this establishment. The drinks are very reasonably priced and they have some really great daily drink/food deals. The food is affordable, nothing spectacular, but the prices are worth it. Vegan pad thai is my favorite, even as an avid meat eater."}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp! ... Does anyone know why you can't post your drafts on the Yelp app for iPhone4s?  Anyways ... The food is alright, nothing spectacular, but decent nonetheless: 3 out of  5... It's a Mixture of pub grub and westernized Asian grub ... The prices are amazingly cheap!   The servers are very friendly and attentive ... and understanding; a buddy and I went there to celebrate his birthday - we ended up getting quite tipsy, and forgot to pay our bill. On my next visit, they waited until they saw me alone and mentioned it, and went on to say that I don't have to pay it right away. Needless to say, I felt embarrassed that I gapped out and left without paying, so it was cool that they didn't mention it in front of my friends, which would have added to the embarrassment. I paid the tab right away. Anyways, I thought that was really cool.  The beer is extremely cheap as well! $3.50 bottles and $4.50 pints. All cocktails are between $3.50 and $4.50! Doubles are $6 bucks! It's a great place to come and drink, especially if you're on a budget! they have an awesome patio to enjoy the cheap drinks.   I recommend they get some bar stools for winter time. I only say that because I was a regular at the restaurant that was here previous - and I always use to meet friendly people sitting there. I'm guessing they don't have bar stools because they call it a cafe ... Which brings me to my next point:  I'm not sure why they call it a cafe, as it doesn't resemble a cafe in any way, what-so-ever, aside from the barista. They should just call it the Urban House.  But yeah ... 5 stars for the for the drinks and friendly service - 3 stars for the food. It's a solid 4. My lone complaint is that they only take cash."}
{"text":"Truly a friendly nice vibe. Entrés are 9 bucks home cooked pints all local taps 5 bucks !  Meal deals are amazing, and everyone is happy here !"}
{"text":"This place can't be beat by any other bar/pub in Toronto/Mississauga.  The beer prices are the cheapest I have seen anywhere, and the offerings are large enough to please any beer taste.  The food is very cheap and the quality of the food is great.  I kind of wish the place was in Mississauga.  I would go weekly.  Then again, since its in Toronto, I'm not tempted to overdo the drinking and eating out."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY. They have an ATM but it's cheaper to bring it there.  My best friend and I are obsessed with this place- and for good reason. $14-16 pitchers at all times, nice little patio which usually has a table for the 2 of us, daily drink specials which include some kind of food... It's also because it's the closest of all their other locations: Nirvana, Green Room, Red Room, Java House, Pour Boy, and the closed since 2013 Pour Girl.  First time I had the pad Thai, which I found very spicy compared to their cousin Nirvana. Nachos are better at cousin Green Room. Sweet potato fries are good but I found it odd they don't have spicy mayo.The soups smell amazing (never had one) and my favorites are probably the fajita/burrito packed with veggies or the noodles. I like that all of their entrees come with a side salad.  The service is friendly and while not always prompt, it's easy to get a hold of someone when you need them.  It's not the most amazing place ever, but I give it 5 stars because it's reliable, familiar, cheap, quaint and, considering it's a dive bar, won't get you sick. Unless you drink too much. Can't help you then."}
{"text":"Every end of the month, there is always a major film networking event that I try my best to attend to.  The prices are easily the best I've ever seen at any pub I've been to in Toronto but I wish it wasn't always so crowded! It's small for such a big event. The food is pretty good even though I wish the menu had a little bit more variety than just rice and noodle bowls.  Still, I come here every month to meet new people and see old friends and get loaded on cheap pints. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"A great choice to have affordable drinks and decent food/snacks (my favourite is the Sautéed Beef Sandwich) with your friends. The staff are friendly and the daily specials are worth taking a look at."}
{"text":"I must have passed Urban House Cafe a thousand times without giving it a try. Last week, looking for somewhere to grab a quick pint, I finally dropped in and I'm so glad I did!  Although the bar is unassuming and a little run down looking from the outside, it's quite spacious inside with plenty of seating. There are nightly food/drink specials and everything on the menu is super cheap!  I have tried the nachos and the chicken curry and they were both pretty good, if not amazing. This would be a great place for a quick pint and something to eat after work, or a get together with friends.  Definitely nothing fancy but gets the job done, and the prices can't be beaten. On the down side, the washrooms are a bit on the gross side if I'm honest."}
{"text":"Most of the pints are only $5.50 and it's got a great little patio out front. These reasons alone earn the Urban House Cafe four stars.  The inside of the restaurant is also quite cozy, and the service was good.  The food is ridiculously cheap but not all that great. I had the burger; it was bland.  Nevertheless, this is a great place to grab a pint."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend trying this place out. The staff are fantastic, the service is amazing, and the prices are magical. Use some of those savings and leave a nice big tip, yo."}
{"text":"This place is great! Cheap beer, great drink deals and food is great. It can get quite packed and loud in here, so it can take a bit to snag a spot but they have a variety of seating options. My personal fave is the patio at front facing side street. I really like the music they play here it's like they have the perfect mix of oldies but goodies. You can't go wrong here, it's always a good time."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood bar these days.  Always casual and comfortable with a mixed clientele.  As someone who's tired of bars in the Church Street Village, Urban House Cafe is such a refreshing addition to the neighborhood and it's off the beaten path. No pretension and great summer patio.     UHC is from the same family as The Red Room, The Green Room (RIP), Java and others.  Same menu, same quality, same prices (which are AMAZING and what food should cost), but it's still a bit of a hidden gem.  Favorite items: Avocado and brie sandwich Pad thai Nachos (simple and cheap)  Food is consistent, staff are attentive.  Don't expect a posh spot, just a comfy nook in the downtown core."}
{"text":"I always wanted a Green Room-type place like this in the neighbourhood and highly regret walking past Urban House a million times over the last few years because I didn't know what it was. I no longer make this mistake and my alcohol intake has increased threefold.  They've recently upped all their prices by a dollar or so (the Thursday special is now $11.50, not $10.50; entrees are $9) but you still can't beat it for a super-caj evening of solid patio beer time. Nice waitstaff, no pretension, questionable food and $5 pints of Boneshaker...what's not to love?  The \"Pad Thai\" is all one colour (reddish beige) and one flavour (SPIIIICY) but there is the most ample amount of protein I have ever seen on any variation of this dish. None of that 6-cubes-of-tofu nonsense here.  The nachos are absolutely terrible but I lived to write this review, so do with that what you will."}
{"text":"Pubs are hit and miss. This one missed on the food. The drink menu is decent. And this neighbourhood pub is a definite contender for a watering hole that's on the inexpensive side of the scale. It's not the most snazziest looking place, but it will hit the spot. However, I would warn against the food. I struggled to find something that appealed to my taste buds. In the end I went with the quesadilla, adding chicken to it. It was pretty bland. Taco Bell serves a more flavourful  chicken quesadilla than this place. My fellow diners also struggled to find food that called out to them. A couple of them asked for chicken to be added to their salad and penne dishes. The chicken was literally tossed on top of the rest of the food. Not within the salad or cooked within the pasta. Just dumped on top. A few side notes: breakfast is only served til 3, they only accept cash and they don't separate bills (even though the menu says for groups of 6 and more, this is apparently misinformation).  Again I stress, avoid the food, enjoy the drinks!"}
{"text":"Even though this place is less than five minutes away from my work, I've never visited Urban House Cafe before. It's not really a cafe and more of a bar and my expectations weren't the highest for this place because I don't expect bar food to be the greatest and only expect passable food as opposed to good food.  Well, they definitely did surprise me when I came here with a few amazing beautiful Yelpers and their gorgeous friends on a Thursday night where they had an entree + a pint of beer for 10.50, which is an amazing deal.   Pros: -No matter what type of person you are, business dude, student, bar maven, bar hopper, clubber, drunk, etc, you don't feel uncomfortable in this place and everyone gets treated equally.   -Their non-bar food (i.e. anything other than burgers, fish and chips, sandwich, etc) is actually quite decent and very good portion sizes.  I ordered the curry pad thai with chicken.  They didn't do the Canadian Asian fusion thing like add ketchup.  It was noodles with a sweet curry with some large chicken pieces, which were grilled very well.  I quite enjoyed this dish. - A few others at my table ordered the chicken fajita and penne (or linguine, I totally forget), but the presentation of all dishes were excellent.  It looks like the cook/chef actually takes some pride in their food, which is more than I can say for a lot of bars/pubs.   -While we came on a Thursday and most of us got the $10.50 special with a pint of beer, they are very accommodating for substitutions.  A couple of people wanted sangria's instead of beer and just paid the difference on the specials.   -Their regular prices aren't too expensive either.  Entree's were 7.95 and nothing was over $10 (that I could see).  Most beers are $4.00-$5.50 for a pint and even the most expensive mixed drink was around $8.  -They knew they were going to have a very busy night and warned us in advance that it'd be best to pay upfront if we wanted split bills.  While some would find this as a con, I think it's very nice they gave us notice upfront and it shows they know how to do advance planning.  Cons: -Men's washroom is kind of grungy. -Cash only  Verdict: Probably one of the better bars/pubs in the area at a reasonable price.  I'd  say for quality, it's right up there with Fionn MacCool's, better than Bishop & Belcher and Spirits, but this place definitely has the best value."}
{"text":"YES YES YES.  I came here monday morning around 2pm, its still morning right? (It was Labour day, so technically it's considered a Sunday morning)  Anyways, we stumbled over her from church and jarvis looking for some noms.   This place is like directly behind the subway station.  So first thoughts, right off the bat...everything was diiiiiiiiiiirt cheap. Like. I didn't see anything over 10 dollars.  We had:  1. The Classic Breakfast - not what I had, but my friends did and said everything was amazing. It looked good, and was served 2 eggs with protien choice, and fries + small salad + toast. Not bad.  2. The Stuffed French Toast - so good. Again, served with Fries + salad.  3. The Avocado and Brie sandwich - I didn't even know about it until after because my friend basically huffed it.   Notes:  The gave me mayo in a squeeze bottle. MY LIFE IS COMPLETE.  The breakfast (all day) is like 6 bux. Like for real real, not for play play.  The fries are like basic shoe string, but fuck, SHOE STRING ARE MY FAVOURITE.  There were like half busy, and everyone looked like they had come for the hangover breakfast.    This place is defo my new hangover breakfast spot.   PS MAYO IN A FREAKING SQUEEZE BOTTLE."}
{"text":"10.50 for an entree and a pint? awesome! the pad thai was very tasty. not gourmet but for the price? unbeatable! ***this review was written in the fall. Great place to come during a night of bar hopping."}
{"text":"The food is hit and miss, but the drinks are the most affordable I've found in the city. The servers are always cheerful and pleasant to talk to, and the patio is relaxing and cozy. Really love this place."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this Pub until my Friend suggested it; I had a fabulous time last night at Urban.  The Pub has a great drink menu.  Best of all, our Waitress was beyond amazing.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Around the corner from barVolo, but pretty much as different as far as you can get as far as bars are concerned.  Pints are $4.50 and it's a small but solid draught selection.  I went on a night when they had $8 entrees and got the pad thai.  It was decent and pretty solid deal for the price.  Cheap-ish beers, not too busy and cheap food - this looks it's going to be the waiting room or post-drinking meal spot for barVolo."}
{"text":"came here on the thursday night for the entree and drink.   sure it was a deal but my pad thai was so bad! I dont think ive had pad thai this bad before and the beef seemed like it came from another dish. My gf had a pasta and it was mediocre as well. I guess you get what you paid for.....  WRONG. I just found out from the reviews below (and that i'm home) that my meal actually came with a salad. Now that I noticed it, the tables beside us all got salad except for us!   I dont want to jump into any conclusions here but I felt quite mistreated tonight."}
{"text":"For a neighbourhood pub, this place is amazing. Don't let the cash only thing put you off-- the prices are so insanely cheap and I'd assume the reason is that they don't pay credit/debit fees. Totally worth it, in my opinion. Come here for cheap drinks, a standard drink menu, chill atmosphere, and good food (for a pub-- be reasonable). As a vegetarian, this place has so many great options, as well. I wouldn't choose to come here solely for dinner, but for snacking while having drinks, it is perfect. Super friendly staff, and great playlists, too. I love it!"}
{"text":"GREAT! cheap, great seating, great service, great food! Have to warn you, the wings are super small (they must be organic ha ha). Sunday they had a pitcher and wing combo for 16.99 and my pad thai was probably under 8 ish. The bill came up to $15 per person for a table of 7 including tips.. wonderful. The menu has a lot of asian dishes and lots to pick from. A friend said it's the same owner who runs green room and red room. Very nice man who seemed to be the owner. Would return and recommend."}
{"text":"I went here for St Patrick's day and it was crowded. We couldn't get a table so my three friends and I sat at the bar. The drink prices here are AMAZING. They have lots of different types of beer and they're between $5-$5.75 for a 20 oz pint (OKAY!). For pitchers it's $13.75. Someone ordered a stir fry and I honestly hated them for it because I already had dinner and it smelled AMAZING. I wish they had coat hooks under the bar. It was a bit uncomfortable sitting there with our giant, puffy coats in our laps. The place has a good vibe and the patio looked awesome. I will 100% be visiting again."}
{"text":"So I visited the Urban House Cafe last month and received terrible service by one staff member. The guy that sat me down was nice enough, but the woman was incredibly rude. I visited the Urban House Cafe intending to write a positive review and after taking a few pictures the female staff reprimanded me and made a scene. So I told her how unprofessional she was being and I grabbed my stuff and left before ordering. That is how upset I felt with her inability to handle the situation in a professional manner. And here my plan was to hype them up.   Fast track to last night. See, the Urban House Cafe is located down the street from my apartment and several good friends visit this establishment and they encouraged me to give them another shot. So last night I did.   When we arrived, the patio was pretty full, but the main dining room had several empty tables available. So my friend and I sat ourselves inside and shortly after John, our waiter came over and provided us with menus. So far so good. I perused the menu, and was happy to see the price point. I had been craving nachos so I ordered nachos without onions for $6.95 and we also got the daily special; wings and a pitcher for $15.95. John asked us what kind of beer we wanted and I asked him for recommendations. My friend and I like strong, dark beer, so John recommended the Black Oak Pale Ale and noted that it would cost $1 more. We were okay with that.   We got our nachos in a reasonable amount of time, followed by the wings. A waitress came by to check in on us and asked if we needed anything else, so we told her that we were still waiting for our drinks. She asked us what our drinks were and I was drawing a blank (I had forgotten the name of the beer), so she summoned John over to ask him and he apologized for the oversight. A few minutes later we had everything we had ordered.   Sadly I found the portions to be quite small, so my friend and I decided to order something else. I chose a grilled cheese with sweet potato fries (fries are extra), and John recommended that I get the grilled cheese with bacon. Sold! My friend and I shared the grilled cheese and I would have to say that the grilled cheese and the sweet potato fries were best food items of the night.   I am so relived that this time around we were addressed with respect and the service was a million times better. Sure, there were errors, the portions were small, the nachos needed more toppings, but all in all John and the staff were kind, attentive, relaxed and made us feel welcomed in their establishment.  I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of drinks, and the food is a good variety.  The food is very delicious too.  Service was great and friendly, and their prices are very reasonable.  I certainly recommend this pub.  The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because they only accept cash (no credit or debit), and the bathrooms were in need of a major renewal.  If we're ever in the area in Toronto again, we would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, cool place to hang out with friends. If you want to grab a bite and a drink after a long day I say come to Urban house!   The burger and fries are so good ! along with their hot 1lb chicken wings !   They have daily specials. I came on a Sunday where the special is 1lb of wings, with a beer pitcher. pretty worth it :)"}
{"text":"Great place :) I went to a meetup event at another pub (ahem...foxes den bar & grill...terrible terrible service!!) They treated us so bad.....we left and had nowhere to go! So I pulled out google maps and led the group to this urban house cafe since it had 4+ stars! With my fingers crossed and about 20 people following behind me, we walked on and into an amazing night of socializing, drinks, and yummy food! I only drank, but everyone who ate had a big smile! This place is amazing for groups!"}
{"text":"In the mood for unique but casual bar fare, my friend and I stopped by Urban House Cafe for a late dinner last night.  Ordering glasses of Steam Whistle Pilsner, we continued with shares of the nachos, Caribbean jerk wings, and fries. While the nachos and the fries were tasty, they were nothing exceptional. However, the Caribbean jerk wings were incredible! Complete with peppercorn, they were perhaps the best wings I have had.  The bar itself, which includes a front patio, is open and inviting, and the staff is friendly. And it is cash-only, so make sure you bring some along!"}
