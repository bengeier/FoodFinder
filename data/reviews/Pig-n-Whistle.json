{"text":"I don't normally feel the need to write a review, but we stopped in to grab some \"memphis rub bbq\" the other day while passing through. Sounded good, slow-roasted memphis rub bbq, right??.  NOT.  This was without a doubt nothing more than boiled meat with regular bbq sauce on top. Bland, watery, stringy boiled meat. The entire family felt the same way. I think what bothers me the most is the very obvious lack of care and effort in making \"bbq\" and then charging $9 for a \"platter\" that consists of scant portions of ordinary potato salad (walmart or costco came to mind) and a few tablespoons of baked beans (which were the best part of the meal). I don't like being ripped off, and definitely felt this place is out to rip off people. NO effort whatsoever to try and make realy bbq.This is NOT slow roased \"memphis rub bbq\". It is boiled meat in water. Horrible."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews that the sides are lacking, specially in flavor. Pork and brisket were surprisingly good and I really liked the chipotle BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"i paid $10 for a very small pulled pork bbq sandwich, small drink with a small side of mac and cheese and a small bread roll. Everything tasted like it came from a can, then stuck straight in the microwave..memphis bbq? that's an insult to memphis! not t mention my food was lukewarm at best. this place should be ashamed to serve such gross food for the money you pay!!!"}
{"text":"I should have known better. Or at least expected less. Pork was extremely bland and hush puppies were so dense they were barely cooked. Mac-n-cheese, however, was decent enough."}
{"text":"My wife and I met up with my uncle and aunt for  lunch. All of us where hungry for a burger. So we decided on this dump! The kid that was running the place was definitely confused when we ordered 1 burger with Swiss cheese, 1 burger with cheddar cheese and 1 burger with cheddar cheese, fries and a drink. It took 15 minutes to for this kid to get our order. We asked him if he was the cook as well, his comment was yup! Wrong there was another kid working that really had NO clue what was going on. We sat there for over an hour on a Monday evening trying to choke this down.  This was 6 days before Christmas and there was only 1 other customer in that time. We then went on to shop. The lady at the next retail shop asked us how are evening was going. We replied with...Well,  we ate this pigs n whistle and the food was gross! She said ha ha ya nobody eats there! WHAT? Damn, wish I would have checked Yelp or talked to this young lady.  All 3 burgers where dry and burned! The burger was frozen at best and there was  1 pickle and 1 slice of onion ( I said NO onion) 1 slice of tomato and 3 little pieces of lettuce.  All 3 of us took several bites and decided it was better to cut or losses and move on. Do yourself a favor....... Don't eat here and save your money!   BTW: I really think this would be a great place of there was an adult there to either run the restaurant or delegate and watch production."}
{"text":"I really don't expect much out of a food-court place, but even so, this place was pretty disappointing.  First off, I was planning on ordering a brisket plate with mac-and-cheese and hushpuppies, and an iced tea. They were out of brisket, out of mac-and-cheese, and had discontinued the hushpuppies even though they were still on the menu. Oh yeah, and there was no iced tea and no ice (they did refill the ice). So zero percent of what I wanted was available.  I ended up ordering pulled chicken, with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. The chicken was pretty dry and tasteless, even with the rub, and the sauce was pretty bland. The mashed potatoes were old, and had some kind of weird skin (not a potato skin, more like the skin you see on pudding). The corn on the cob was actually ok.  To their credit, they did give me a discounted price because of everything being unavailable.  If you're stuck eating at the food court at the outlets, I'd suggest going to one of the safer places, like the Chinese place, or the sandwich place."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good BBQ. Not a fan of the sides, but the pork is great, tangy with vinegar."}
{"text":"I stopped by the Pig-n-Whistle to grab a drink while waiting for my wife to finish up with her retail therapy. Her shopping pushed us into the lunch zone so I returned to order the Pig Plate for about $8. You get some pig with some BBQ sauce  plus two sides. The mashed potatoes were a little to runny or watery for my taste and really didn't taste too good. The beans were ok, I would rate them as average. The pork was good, but next time I'll tell them not to put the BBQ sauce on the meat. I really enjoyed the free refills on the soda."}
{"text":"It's 1 pm on a Saturday and they are out everything! No ribs not pulled pork so chicken or hamburger boring very disappointing in sitting at the table with no food because of how slow they are! Never ever will go here again! Manager thought it was funny!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!  Waited 45 mins just to order and we are the ONLY customers here. Terrible nut from reading the reviews I am happy to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Blah, bland, flavorless pulled chicken. Needs bar b que sauce to make it edible. Brisket was probably boiled as well. Corn on the cob was mooshy. Mashed potatoes were of the instant flavor variety.. Service was friendly. Won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Food was average and my bun for my chicken sandwich was still frozen. But what really upset us was the service. The girl taking our order was still texting on her phone. Probably the laziest set of workers I've ever seen on this busy Sunday.  We're locals up here and we keep trying this place. It's just plain awful. The staff is so lazy they never have any meat cooked."}
{"text":"BBQ sauce was good and so were the sides. A bit of sweet and a bit of spice. Not bad at all and we will be back. The sides are a bit lacking, but, add more sauce to the beans and they're MUCH better. Try the coleslaw on the pulled pork...very nice."}
