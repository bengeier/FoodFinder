{"text":"Love this place the food is always consistent and the customer service is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"A great deli! I'm a vegetarian and got the Marley, very fresh ingredients and super tasty. My partner got the East Ender and loved the quality of meat on it. The interior is lacking due to zoning issues. So plan on picking these up, not dining in. The owner seems super helpful and friendly, too."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to stop by the deli today. I live close by and work from home, so I've been hoping to have a good place to walk to for a quality, reasonably priced sandwich. Turns out I do.  Everyone was really nice, and they told me about today's special (corned beef Wednesday, the Run DMC) and their Turkey Tuesday for future reference. Everything on the menu was appealing, but went with the daily special. The meat was choice and delicious; the cheese options were all tempting, but the (smoked?) gouda was a good one to go with; the condiments (mayo [they have both mayo and miracle whip] and spicy mustard) were plentiful but not so much to make the sandwich messy or soggy; the lettuce, tomato, and onion were fresh and crisp. Great value for the money. I'm looking forward to making this place a habit."}
{"text":"me, my mom, dad, and cousin came here after the museam of art and history and it's amazing I got the turkey sandwhich  my mom got the macho man and so did my dad and my cousin got the pastrami they all loved it and so did i"}
{"text":"Nice to have a locally-owned and operated deli in the area! My sister and I stopped by on Turkey Tuesday and had turkey and swiss sandwiches on wheat bread with lettuce, tomato, and just the right amount of mustard. Everything was so fresh and tasty, and the turkey was piled high! They also have a menu of specialty sandwiches like the \"Mean Joe\" and the \"Monongahela Monster\" that sounded delish. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite deli in the area. Everyone is very nice and the sandwiches are incredible! The different types of sandwiches are new and creative and completely customizeable. I would highly recommend it to anyone who lives or works in the area or is ever near the Edgewood town center."}
