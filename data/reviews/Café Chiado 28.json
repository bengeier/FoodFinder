{"text":"GReat cozy place with nice decor and friendly service! Latte and teas are tasty and croissant like in Europe!"}
{"text":"Really cute interior with a mezzanine to hang out and study. Big windows-lots of light. Friendly staff-a group of brothers or family maybe? Only knocking stars because the coffee is a bit lackluster. It seems they really put a lot of attention on creating a beautiful cafe but didn't put the same care into their beans. Still a nice place to hang out but I wouldn't make a trip just for the coffee."}
{"text":"Belle découverte. Bon café, belle place. Petit point négatif, il fait chaud en haut des marches sous les luminaires où on retrouve une petit espace supplémentaire pour s'installer. Environ 8,50 $ apprx pour un latte et un petit muffin. Un peu cher mais c'était bon. Je recommande l'endroit."}
{"text":"My friend and I have the passport barista that we got from restomania, so we went onto our Montreal coffee crawl. Café Chiado 28 is such a beautiful place! The bicycle on the ceiling is a beautiful touch. The service is slow, but there was one person working. The barista was very honest to us, he told us that he makes awful Chai. That was very very good of him. Despite his honesty, my sister still ordered a Chai latte. He was right; it wasn't good. It was more warm milk than Chai. But my cappuccino was wonderful. The best part of this coffeeshop is the decor."}
{"text":"My friend and I noticed this cafe was on our barista passport so we decided to check it out. First thing that caught our eye was the fun decor. We took a few minutes just to look around on both floors and take pictures before we ordered anything. The service was a bit slow but the barista was very honest about his skills and what he was better at making. My latte was good but I will need to go back to try out some of the treats that looked so good. There are two floors in the cafe so lots of room to go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"A very cute and charming cafe with really nice decors. Yes this cafe has a bike hanging, it is the main attraction of the cafe. They have the cutest hanging lights all around, large windows which allows the beautiful sun to come through and for you to look out at all times. There's a second floor which is decorated with paintings and plants. Unfortunately it was very humid upstairs but we stayed upstairs because we were a large group. The barista was very polite, professional and honest. He suggested what we should order and what we shouldn't because he wasn't great in making certain drinks compared to another barista. The cappuccino was excellent. I added some agave syrup instead of sugar. We were offered freshly out of the oven natas. The custard pastry was excellent. My friends ordered iced drinks which were good but I preferred the cappuccino. There's a lot of options for dessert and lunch items. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Le café de quartier par excellence, simple, cosy & remplie de charme! Définitivement une adresse pour les belles journées d automne et hiver qui s'en viennent"}
