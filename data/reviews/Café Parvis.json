{"text":"Lunch today here was pleasant. The menu consists of 6 or so pizzas (served in single slices) and about the same number of salads (available in 3 different sizes) -- all with healthful, imaginative ingredients. A welcome addition to downtown eating at a decent price. Unfortunately they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place because it gets great reviews by critics but the food is only ok for the price and the service is god awful! I went twice in hopes that the experience would be different the second time around but both times I was seriously disappointed. The one redeeming quality is the venue! The decor is really nice and the terrace in summer is beautiful but honestly not worth it!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Montreal. Tomatoes with basil and ragu were the highlights of the menu"}
{"text":"The decor is so beautiful and peaceful - it's worth it just for that! We grabbed a coffee and hot chocolate at the counter, along with a croissant. The vibe is so chill, so friendly. Not cheap, but a great date or meeting spot."}
{"text":"So you may have trouble finding this place given there's construction going on in the area but it's definitely worth the couple of minutes walking in circles! The scaffolding in front of Cafe Parvis doesn't interfere with the restaurant much though they close their terrace during the day during construction (at night it's open!). Great place. Had a tasty piece of cheddar, cauliflower and bacon pizza for like 7 dollars. Great meal, good price and even better coffee. Bonus points for the pretty space and the cool looking waiters that somehow manage to all look like models yet still be super nice."}
{"text":"You feel like you're on the set of a gorgeous Woody Allen movie when you eat here! The ambience is chic and the food is gorgeously prepared. The server recommended me and awesome wine and my friends and I had one of the best lunches I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch with a coworker, long after the usual lunch rush is over. There were a few other people around, but no hostess to seat us, so we weren't sure if we could just choose our own seats or not. We decided to sit down at a table in the terrasse since there were other people there ordering. The terrasse is beautiful, by the way. Just sunny enough and very nicely decorated. The place has character. Service was slow. It took a while for the waitress to notice us and bring us water and menus, even though she knew we were there.  That said, the entire menu looks fresh, tasty, and healthy, and the prosciutto pizza was incredible. The crust wasn't really anything like a real Italian pizza, but delicious nonetheless. If you have the time to spare, it's definitely worth a try,"}
{"text":"We went here because of the good reviews. We got 2 cappuccino s and a croissant. 20 mins later i asked for our order and the lady said they forgot our order. Not coming again."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff. Tuna salad was great. Kids enjoyed their pizza. Limited menu options. Overall very nice."}
{"text":"I stopped in today for a quick lunch at the recommendation of the staff at the leather goods shop called M0851! But it turned out to be a great tip. I sat at the bar by myself in this very busy joint, and found myself next to a lovely french-speaking woman who had just started a magazine on food culture in Montreal. She was a delightful conversation partner as I enjoyed my small couscous salad and slice of sausage pizza. Both were deliciious and the atmosphere was wonderful.   It turns out that finding a good place for lunch in downtown Montreal near the shopping area of Ste. Catherine Street is easier said than done. Stop here and you cannot go wrong. I'm fold that the new place next door is good for dinner. I'll be there tonight!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza, soups and salads - delicious!!! Charming atmosphere is youthful and vibrant."}
{"text":"Le Café Parvis, endroit de délices, a été une découverte un jeudi soir alors que nous voulions allé au Furco. Le petit frère du Furco a été un choix, ma foi, fantastique puisque il a su nous accueillir dans une ambiance décontractée et surtout, sans chichi.  Oui le décor est super hipster. Oui, le gars à côté de vous ressemble à un bûcheron bien coiffé. Oui, ils font du vin maison. Mais dis donc, ça rajoute au charme de l'endroit et la bouffe est délicieuse.  Les pizzas sont vraiment bonnes. Pommes de terre, margharita, prosciutto et balsamique... tellement de saveurs et autant de choix pour une modeste somme, moi j'accepte le deal!  J'ai vraiment aimé ma visite. Au final, le Parvis est vraiment une parfaite mise-en-bouche pour accompagner ensuite le Furco."}
{"text":"The place and atmosphere are very nice  The service is decent, but nothing special.   As for the food  We ordered the salmon pizza Abd the tahini pizza  The toppings were not bad,  But the crust was so-so Although it's supposed to be oven baked, it felt more like flat bread than crust, and it was soggy  We didn't have desert"}
{"text":"I've never reviewed anything on Yelp, but I had to after that experience I had! The service was so HORRIBLE it amazed me!  I walked in and waited for 30 min for someone to take my order and no one did! Although it was not busy at all! Lol And all of them are angry! Quite a service.."}
{"text":"White sangria to drink, shrimp pizza to eat: Best decision I've made so far in Montreal. Their pizzas are delicious and the cafe is too cute!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Cafe Parvis. We got there around 8 Monday night. It is located on a little alleyway that you wouldn't expect to have such a cozy restaurant. About half way down the alley, we noticed the large windows filled with warm light and lots of beautiful plants. There was also a nice outdoor eating area as well. We sat at the bar as the prepared some foods. It was pretty busy for a Monday night and could serve a number of different purposes. There were people there by themselves on laptops and there were large tables in one area that would be good for bigger groups. We order some beers and also split a pizza with ricotta, mushrooms and cured meat. They provided an english menu for us to order from. The waitstaff was very friendly. The pizza wasn't huge, but we weren't very hungry and splitting it was the perfect amount of food. I would definitely go back for dinner and would also like to check it out for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great location. Doesn't even feel like your in the middle of the Montreal. Just off of St.Catherine. Great food and Sangria. Try the Breakfast Pizza!"}
{"text":"We came across this place by surprise. The food was really good and the prices were more than reasonable. Staff was prompt & friendly. Worth the trip for a nice relaxing lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing Almond croissant, great capuccino, and good brunch dishes in a really nice envitonment"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Tried to reservation, I was asked to wait on the phone and I waited for 4 min, the person never came back on the phone. So I went straight to the restaurant. Ordered the chicken on the appetizer. It looks nice but tastes sickening and was very expensive. Would not go back again."}
{"text":"Loved this place and I can't wait to visit Montreal again to come back here! My friend and I came here for lunch... ...he said he'd only grabbed coffee from here but he thought I would like it, and they had soup which my friend wanted because he was sick -- so we went. Everything from the decor to the food was fascinating. I am a sucker for places with great atmosphere... and this place had me by the balls. We got there right at it's busiest hour for lunch... the main area was filled but we quickly got seated at a calmer section in the back.  Overall, service was great. The girls were helpful and cute. Turns out one of my friends works there too! That was a nice surprise. Food was eccentric, healthy and delicious. Well priced too.  If you're looking for a \"bargain\" this isn't exactly the place.  If you want to eat a healthy delicious experience... this is where to go. A bientot."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon with a friend. It was a little busy, but were served right away. They did sit us at the other side of a table that two girls were already eating at...a little close for comfort lol, but it wasn't an issue. Service was wonderful - I ordered a mocha (delicious!!) and my friend had a cappuccino. As well, my friend had the prosciutto pizza and I got the margherita blanche. They arrived on cute wooden boards, as well as an infused oil of some sort that I found myself dipping my crust into. The pizza was flavorful and delicious (it also made for yummy leftovers the next morning haha!). The decor was magical, almost like walking into a treehouse turned cafe, with its wooden structure and foliage hanging from the ceiling. There was also an outdoor terrace. It definitely did not seem like we were in the hustle-and-bustle of downtown. Quiet & quaint, with delicious food!"}
{"text":"Amazing Brunch!  Breakfast pizza, french toast, breakfast ragu and breakfast sandwich - all were phenomenal.  Outdoor street side seating amongst the fresh veggies. One of the best breakfasts in Montreal."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a big group of co-workers yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Healthy, delicious, and non-traditional in the combinations of toppings and ingredients for their pizzas and salad and served with grace and a friendly smile in a luscious green space. I was in heaven. The bread pudding with butterscotch sauce was a delight at the end of the meal, especially between sips from a very well-made latte. Best to share the dessert though, it was rich (but not too sweet) and the portion was ample!  Oh, and did I mention that the prices were extremely reasonable? I am so happy to discover Café Parvis and that it is so close to my work!  I loved the massive wall of tomato plants growing and flowering already on the terrasse. Beautiful spot."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée pour prendre un café avec un ami de longue date et l'ambiance était bien. L'endroit dégage un décor féérique avec ses lumières tamisées et les plantes suspendues. Pour le lunch, le menu se résume pas mal aux pizzas maisons et à quelques salades. C'est un bel endroit pour y aller prendre un verre entre amis ou juste pour luncher à quelques pas du centre-ville!"}
{"text":"The place is spacious and nicely hidden.  The menus isn't a big one but pizzas there are good.  I tired the salmon pizza which was quite fulfilling and tasty."}
{"text":"Really cute cosy Cafe with plants hanging from the ceiling. Try the \"out of this world\" ricotta with butter sage and squash, the delicious beetroot salad. Busy but quiet enough ambiance so you don't have to yell to have a conversation (On a Tuesday). Nice Terrace tucked away in the middle of downtown. Some pizza flat bread are good but some are missing the mark...perhaps  pizza should be eaten at a real wood oven Italian pizzeria and Cafe Parvis should focus on other delicious dishes. seasonal menu. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"I went to Café Parvis because I thought the space was just beautiful for breakfast during the week. The thing is, it's about the only thing.   I ordered a orange pekoe tea and the waffle with poached egg and bacon.  When I received the tea it was really blend. They didn't put enough tea leaves in the little bag... I was drinking hot water basically. When I told them, they told me they would charge me for another bag of tea. So I said no thank you.   Then the food arrived. Looked OK. I mean, the salad looked blend and without seasoning.  When I tried... it was mainly salad with oil. I had to ask for lemon wedge. Just because no salt, pepper or vinaigrette was added.   Then the waffle. What a disappointment... the waffle itself was soggy... bacon really thick and over cooked (but not crispy) and the egg was barely and poached egg.  The best thing on this plate was the maple syrup. Unfortunately.   HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.   SO, overall impression.  Service: OK Food: mediocre  Ambiance: beautiful.   That's why I'm giving a 2/5  I'll try the lunch next time. Maybe it will be better...  better luck next time I guess."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already, so this review is going to be reflective of all my experiences here and not just my last.   The ambience: one of most insta-worthy restaurants and cafes I've been to in this city. The vines, wooden tables, and glasses create a charming and hipster environment that you can't help but want to photograph, especially in the day. I'm not sure about the night, since I've only been there once in the evening but sat on the terrace. I can't help but wonder how they manage to keep so many plants alive.  The food: I've liked everything that I've tried so far, which is pretty impressive considering I've been there four or five times. The coffee is, in my opinion, some of the best downtown. The pizzas are amazing.   The service: fast, attentive, and professional. Our glasses were kept well-filled even when we were sitting outside, which is always a mark of good service to me."}
{"text":"Absolutely Montreal and exquisite Mediterranean food, service and ambiance.  Would return in a heartbeat.  Beautiful terrace. Great location."}
{"text":"This place is great. Dispatch coffee severed by knowledgeable staff using great equipment. Funky modern comme post-apocalyptic interior. Same owners (and I believe designer) as Bar Furco next door. Lunch is crazy busy, but surprisingly quick with some delicious \"gourmet\" pizzas and salads. Great vibe.   1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.   2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one? 3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch. 4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible. 5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Really good brunch!! I tried the breakfast sandwich, the breakfast pizza, and the latte. The breakfast sandwich was on a fresh croissant -- this was my fave and I would have again. The breakfast pizza had egg and avocado on it -- unconventional brunch item, a bit salty. Latte was standard, but complimented the meal and atmosphere. The portions were not massive, but a satisfying size. I went on a Sunday at 11 and there was plenty of space. Service was excellent. Simple menu. Good vibes here :)"}
{"text":"Really terrific off the beaten track cafe. Small menu, mainly salads and pizzas, in interesting combinations. Chorizo soup was absolutely delicious. Beet and goat cheese salad was great. I loved the watercress tomato and feta pizza. Good beer and wine selection. Friendly service. I'd go back there in a heartbeat. Not expensive."}
{"text":"Great meal and friendly though slightly aloof staff. Loved their cream of mushroom and leek soup!"}
{"text":"The critiques were promising for this little café/pizzeria and the hype was right. Had lunch here for the first time a few months ago and everything exceeded our expectations. The front terrace is adorable and intimate and the service is always good. The pizzas and salads are always very good, as are the desserts (the brownie being my all time fave) and the cappuccino is great. This place is a gem in the heart of downtown and we've become regulars ever since. I've been for lunch and supper so brunch is next on my list!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for brunch and have been seeing a lot about Café Parvis via Instagram and many foodies blogs, so of course I had to try it... I arrived there around twelve and the restaurant was almost full. I have to say that the decor is really nice and the location is great especially if you want to attend a show at the Quartier des Spectacles.  I was seated at the bar and ordered a latte and the Hasbrown Benedictines. My order was served quickly, but unfortunately for me, the food was less than warm, it tasted ok but nothing extraordinary. I won't be going back for brunch but will probably visit again to try their lunch or dinner menu."}
{"text":"I mean seriously !! Were we invisible that you no one could have approach us with water and suggestion like any other restaurant?, and of course when the other table next to us sat (25 min after) , the waitress came and went through the menu ... Offered water ...frustrating !!"}
{"text":"Nous y allons souvent le midi et aimons le concept qui permet de prendre de grosses portions de salades et des pizzas à partager. La salade de betterave est excellente, mais tout sur le menu est à essayer. En soirée, le tartare est bon. Je n'ai pas encore tout essayé sur le menu du soir mais y retournerai.   Le décor est super aussi, mais il y a un gros chantier de construction, alors la terrasse est moins plaisante pour cette raison. De grandes fenêtres permet d'avoir un bel éclairage naturel.   Si vous voulez une belle place avant un concert ou un midi, sans prétention, c'est la place. On partage parfois une table plus grande avec d'autres personnes.   Seul inconvénient, c'est qu'ils servent le vin dans des verres qui ne sont pas optimales pour déguster le vin. Mais bon, le service sympathique nous fait oublier le détail.  Excellent café également."}
{"text":"Fantastic measl for our first night in Montreal. Had appetizer of seared ahi and asparagus, phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Café Parvis is expensive but worth it. It was really hard to find the place because it has the same interior and outlook as the fancy restaurant next door (same owner) and you can't tell if it's one restaurant or two. The interior and ambience is enchanting, especially during summer when the terrace is open and the vine leaves are about.   Their latté game is en pointe, one of the better ranking lattés I've had in Montreal and I've had quite a lot of lattés actually.   The servers are also friendly, they accidentally prepared two lattés and we ordered only one so offered us the other one for free.   I would advice staying away from the flatbread pizzas if you want to eat here on a budget. I had the salmon flatbread and it tasted good but I wish I could've shared it with someone (my friend already ordered salad). If you're going with your boyfriend, order a flatbread and share. And sit by the window.  Also don't forget to bring your instagram gear, great place for cute café pictures."}
{"text":"Quelle belle découverte! Le café Parvis propose un décor vraiment original, intimiste, moderne et a la fois vintage. J'ai adoré la verdure présente partout mais surtout sur des plaques suspendues et qui tombent au dessus du bar. La bâtisse a gardé certains de ses décors 'd'avant ' et on peut voir des murs portant des restants de peinture, des portes vintage et autres éléments de decor que j'ai adoré. Un mélange bois, métal et matières naturelles ainsi que des verres et des tasses visibles... ca donne une vraie belle atmosphère! Le resto a différents espaces, la salle principale donne une vue sur la rue et la terrasse d'été et il y a d'autres salles derrière avec de grandes tables. Le bar est également une belle option pour manger.  Le menu est exquis. Des grosses entrées, des plats qui viennent en taille mini, maxi ou 'à partager '. J'ai adoré l'originalité des combinaisons, la présence des légumes, les mix de textures. J'ai choisi 2 plats en taille mini ce qui ma finalement bien comblée. J'ai goûté les têtes de violon pour la première fois et la façon dont c'était cuisiné et mélangé à d'autres légumes était superbe. Chaque mini plat était a environ 9-10$. Les copines avec qui j'étais ont pris des plats taille maxi ou des pizzas. Les pizzas avaient l'air fantastiques, avec des éléments frais dessus et une fois de plus des combinaisons originales. Pas votre fromage-pepperoni! A priori elles ont adoré!  C'est un lieu que j'aimerai retenter pour le brunch ou au lunch. J'ai vraiment adoré!"}
{"text":"I love their coffee. The place looks beautiful with its interior. I also had a pizza, i forgot the name, but it tasted fresh and delicious. The service is also always friendly. The cafe is conveniently located near McGill so I frequently visit this place. 5/5 for coffee and 3.5/5 for the pizza, 5/5 for ambience."}
{"text":"Jai bien aimé mon experience ! Un tres beau restaurant avec un excelent menu !   Jai testé le brunch et jai ete bien surpris ! Les plat proposés etait étonnant et délicieux !   Je vais y retourner cest certain !"}
{"text":"Cafe Parvis has a great atmosphere and a unique set up. The food and drinks are really good however, I rate it a 4 star instead of a 5 because the staff can sometimes be unfriendly and it can be very expensive depending on what you order."}
{"text":"These guys do pizzas their own way. Even though I'm snobby about pizzas, I didn't mind it cause it was unique. Idk how they make their dough, but damn, it was delicious. I tried the avocados, source cream  and a bunch of green stuff (watercress, I think lol) pizza. It was pretty good, they could tone down the sour cream a bit though."}
{"text":"Très joli restaurant caché tout près du La Baie au Centre-Ville. C'est en fait le voisin du Furco. L'atmosphère est décontractée, le personnel est sympathique et la décoration est magnifique et relaxante.  Le menu change de temps à autre et offre plein de belles possibilités.  C'est génial pour le brunch (ils offrent toujours au moins une option sans gluten). Si vous ne voulez pas faire la file, arrivez un peu avant 11 h. P.-s. Leur café et délicieux!  Pour le lunch et le souper, vous vous délecterez de leurs pizzas, de leurs salades et de leurs autres superbes plats. La carte des vins est assez chouette aussi.  Lorsque la température le permet, ils ouvrent leurs gigantesques portes vitrées à l'avant et on se sent un peu comme sur une terrasse tout en étant à l'extérieur (il est aussi carrément possible de prendre place sur la terrasse). Ne vous laissez pas décourager par les barrières et les trucs du chantier qui se trouve juste à côté. Le Café Parvis en vaut vraiment la peine!"}
{"text":"An unplanned visit: initially planned to go to furco but it was packed - ended up next door discovering this secret garden. We were seated relatively quickly.  It was breath taking in decor along the lines of Jatoba or kampai garden styled greens. We sat at the bar. It was crazy how lively the place was- but not overly loud. I would recommend making reservations though. They have a terrace available as well.  We had white wine by the glass. The cocktails seemed fun as well. For the main course- one word PIZZAA! Delish. Gourmet styled oven baked pizza served on a naan-like bread. The marguerita pizza was great not too heavy as a meal-12$ only! And large enough to share or take leftovers home.   For dessert- I would've loved to have their home baked cookies but they ran out quickly :( the person next to me had the last one!!! Salad bowls looked delectable - on my bucket list to try out next!  My phone was dead, my words don't do justice to how pretty the food was."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times now, the atmosphere is amazing! the staff are great and the menu is definitely interesting.  The pizzas can be hit or miss, interesting flavors, but I have ran into a few bland ones. Salads are good, but again, some misses for me.  Good alcohol selection! Would recommend for a group outing!"}
{"text":"Délicieuses pizzas et salades. Je ne me tanne jamais du Café Parvis. Tout est toujours délicieux. Les brunchs du week-end sont tout aussi excellent. La section à l'entrée du restaurant peut parfois être bruyante, je préfère et recommande les tables vers le fond."}
{"text":"Nice European feel.  Good pizza, amazing grilled corn salad.  It's busy at 5pm and you might have to share a table..."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place, it's a little hidden due to construction site but totally worth it.  The pizzas are really good, fresh, and not over done with the traditional \"Quebec all dressed option\". There is actual care and love put into the choice of toppings.  The real super star here was the salads?!?! I know! Don't believe me if you don't want to, I know it's hard to describe a \"good salad\" but it is jammed stupid with nuts, berries, fresh dressing, vegetables and its super fun that they come in different sizes. It's difficult as a blue collar grown man to say to my friends \"go there for the great salad\" but I guess that is what yelp is for. Just tell everyone you are going there for the pizza! When you arrive you can \"change your mind\" and order the crazy good salads."}
{"text":"This is a lovely place, in an otherwise sparse food landscape. It was packed when we got there for lunch on a Sunday, and service was cheerful but slow/understaffed. But the pizzas and salads were excellent - everything was very fresh and of high quality. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went to this place after work, for a quick coffee with a colleague. Place is a bit hidden from the main downtown street (between Maisonneuve and St Catherine).  We each took a coffee, machiatto and latte, and shared a scone but noticed they also have a good menu selection.  It was a nice sunny day, and we were able to sit by the open window/terrasse. Loved the greenery from the hanging plants plus the vibe, it was a nice relaxing atmosphere away from the busyness and the rush of people getting out from work in downtown.  Worth a stop! Would definitely return for a sit down meal next time."}
{"text":"This is perhaps the best pizza I've ever had. Perfect crust. Chewy but dry enough. And the ingredients are simple and of terrific quality. I also had the heirloom tomato starter and roasted eggplant. Both stellar. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"It was a little hard to find this place as there is construction around it.  But once I was seated and have a look at the menu, it was worth going through the trouble.  I ordered the scotch egg and the French toast.  Both were delicious, but the scotch egg was the .  It was served with seasoned bok choy, asparagus, and mashed asparagus.  Mashed asparagus was surprisingly the most delicious part of the dish.  I was skeptical about it at first, but after I tasted it, I wish I had more."}
{"text":"Location: Downtown core. If you're using transit, you can get off at McGill or Place-des-Arts and it'll be a short walk from both. Street parking is 'available' but metered. That being said, good luck finding a spot, especially with all the construction. Use the subway or walk.  The place: I walked in and thought I'd already been here before because it reminds me so much of Falco, next door. A lot of wood, big windows - it's a pretty cozy place. We lucked out and got a seat by the window. If you plan on going for lunch on a weekday, get there before Noon or call to see if they take reservations. It fills up pretty quickly.   The goods: My date and I ordered individual pizzas (meaning that we were too selfish to share) and two salads (we shared those). She went with the veggie pizza while I chose the Italian sausage variety. So first, these pizzas are small, but since each dish is meant to be shared, I'm OK with that. I think that if you were dining alone and ordered a pizza + salad, you'd be good to go. Anyway, the sausage pizza was quite delicious. The only downside is that there was nothing hot about it. In terms of salad, we ordered the beet and the cauliflower. I enjoyed both, and the portions were actually fairly large so we had some leftovers that we just couldn't finish. I think it would be nice to have the beet salad served warm, but that's just my preference. One thing I will say - the cheese that is served with this salad (goat, I think?) was SO bloody good.   Service: Overall, the service was good - our water glasses were always full and staff checked on us regularly. However, we were asked five times if we were done, when our salad bowls were visibly NOT empty. While I certainly appreciate the desire to clear tables quickly, I don't want to be asked if I'm done, that many times. We were a bit put off by this.   Price point: Each dish ranges between $6-$10, if I recall."}
{"text":"The weather is super hot; we are walking around. We are starting to get hungry, then I remembered I always wanted to try this café. When we arrived, the indoor is full, but I was happy to be seated outdoor. The service was very friendly, helpful and amiable. Our drinks and food arrived very quickly. My sister and I ordered the watercrass/tomato/avocado/goat cheese pizza. It was simply delicious. I loved the ambiance outside, since we are far from public."}
{"text":"First, due to construction it's kind of hard to find. Second, it's clean and pretty but taste does not match the look. Third, very crowded so I thought must be the \" it \" place but I don't think so. Fourth, i think they play too much with instagram to get it hype but really... it's just plain. Overall, I give 4 stars Bc the staffs were nice and I guess I expected way too much before I went so I was disappointed with the result. Tastes and plating is 3.5 stars. With the ingredients they put.. it's hard to fail but just didn't meet my expectation."}
{"text":"Enjoyed what initially seemed like an unusual menu. Very delicious grilled romaine salad and pizza"}
{"text":"After a very long wait I received my itty bitty square of pizza and it was practically cold. I could see all the itty bitty squares of pizza sitting under the heating lamp and I guess it had probably been sitting there for a long time. Considering the portion size and that it was almost cold, it definitely seemed overpriced. The flavour was nice (disregarding everything else) but I would not return here."}
{"text":"Montreal Day Trip! I was brought here by a friend who lives in Montreal. We walked 20 minutes to get to Cafe Parvis for lunch and it was totally worth it. This little cafe is hidden away near St.Catherine Street and would not be an easy place to find if you weren't familiar with the area. The atmosphere is very relaxing with well maintained greenery hanging off the ceiling and walls which I really enjoyed. Felt like I was dining in a forest almost. Service was great and the food was spectacular! We ordered some salad which were all super refreshing. I ordered the smoked salmon pizza topped with green peas, arugula, fennel, smoked salmon and flying fish roes. It was SUPER fresh and portion was quite big (for me) as I couldn't finish the entire pizza by myself. I loved how all the veggies/ herbs were fresh and unseasoned so the only apparent flavour to the pizza was the smoked salmon so it was just the right level of saltiness. To finish off the meal, I had a latte which was very aromatic and deliciously creamy. I would definitely return to this place if I had the chance to visit Montreal again!"}
{"text":"The decor and ambience is really nice. They have a lot of greenery inside, making it a nice escape from the cold weather outside. The four of us split a brussel sprouts salad, a beetroot salad, a fish pizza and a chicken pizza. They were all delicious! I particularly loved the salads. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful place! Café Parvis has a dreamy interior, with lots of pothos hanging from the ceiling, large wooden tables, faded green-blue walls revealing cement underneath, creaky wooden floors and the warm glow of the pizza oven in back of the kitchen.   It seems wildly popular for brunch, so it gets a little too noisy to chat comfortably. I went there to meet a friend for brunch Sunday morning, and arrived right at opening time. It's a good thing I was early, because 30 mins later would have resulted in waiting in line. Nevertheless, I did not make any reservation, so to my great regret, we couldn't sit at those tiny marble-top tables by the window (the light there was really beautiful, especially with the first snow of the season!) We sat at the bar, and each ordered from the brunch menu. I got the Poaches Eggs (17$) and she got the Pulled Pork (14$). The food came fairly fast and was beautifully plated, but prices were a bit high given portion sizes. The items were also slightly different than described (e.g. toast instead of english muffin, no hollandaise). The poached eggs were a pleasure to eat, especially with the toast underneath to soak up the yolk. The food was very comforting on a winter morning!  After our meal, we checked out their working spaces upstairs, which were just as inviting as the restaurant below. Not a single soul was up there, despite comfy couches, plenty of desks and electrical plugs, and great lighting. Again, the price is a bit high (25$/day) for students, but I'm sure there a lot of productivity-seeking professionals that would love it."}
{"text":"Fantastic unique pizzas, had the avocado watercress pizza. Very nice atmosphere and  reasonably priced. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Bien adoré ma première expérience là-bas! L'ambiance de soir était tamisé et calme, pas trop bruyant ou silencieux, un bon juste milieu!  La soupe du jour était goûteuse et délicieuse, le chai, très bon et la salade également. Le rapport qualité prix est plus qu'acceptable selon moi.   Il y avait un peu d'attente avant qu'on soit placés au bar que j'ai malgré tout aimé et cet endroit est plutôt gigantesque, il y a de l'espace pour accueillir assez grand nombre de gens donc super pratique pour les heures de pointe j'imagine.   J'y retournerais sans hésiter surtout que c'est vraiment central comme café/resto."}
{"text":"I've been trying to discover the vegetarian/vegan scene a bit more so I knew I had to check this place out and it didn't disappoint.   I sat outside so I can't really vouch for how comfortable it is. But their little terrace is only comfortable if you're in the shade. We were seated right under the sun and it was not pleasant. The chairs are metallic so you start to sweat and stick to it and it's not a fun way to have a meal.   Service is really quick and the busboy circled many times to give us water (thank god) which is a plus because lots of places forget to refill your water.   We ordered the vegan burger and pear/bacon pizza to share and I'm still raving about it. Who knew putting pear on a pizza with bacon would create such beautifulness? The taste is perfectly balanced with a hint of sweet and salty.   The burger was also delicious. I'm really getting into bean patties because they're so mushy and taste so good with avocado and lettuce. It came with a side salad too with just the right amount of zesty vinaigrette.   Excellent Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Came here last week on a Monday night with the boyfriend after catching Dave Chappelle at the Just for Laughs fest. We originally went to Furco, but service was so slow (yes, even on a Monday night, people...) that we just got up and went next door.  Good : I actually really enjoyed the portabello mushrooms with the meat sauce. The boyfriend complained that it was to meaty (for a guy who always complain about needing 'more protein'). The decor was really nice, a big open window and trendy hipster decor. Great summer vibe to it. Oh, and pizzas are all $10 after 9pm (What perfect timing!)  Bad : The salmon pizza was actually okay...but just okay. It was $10 good, but not $16 good.   Bottom Line : If I am craving carbs but still feeling cheap, I'd probably still come back for $10 pizzas, but it's not mind blowing food. Great location by the Quartier Spectacles!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! What a hidden little gem we found. The outside of the restaurant is very European looking which immediately caught our eye and the inside is so darling-fresh plants hanging from the ceiling. The food is perfect and unpretentious! I love small menus that specialize in a few good items. The cauliflower salad is perfect as a small, another larger is way too filing and the pizza is the lightest, airiest I've ever had. Their lattes are delicious - very comparable to the quality of Europe. A must visit!"}
{"text":"Apres lui avoir donné une troisième et dernière chance, il n'y a rien à faire. Malgré la nourriture assz bonne, le service au Parvis est absolument pourri. Alors que le restaurant était plus qu'à moitié vide, nous avons attendus 15 minutes pour nous faire servir pour ensuite voir une table de gens arrivé après nous recevoir leur repas et cocktails avant les nôtres. La serveuse m'a offert une huile piquante pour la pizza a laquelle j'ai dit oui. Elle ne l'a jamais apporter. Une autre fois c'était tellement long avant qu'il vienne prendre notre commande (au dessus de 15 minutes) que j'ai du demander au busboy si c'était possible de commander. Sans mentionné que tout le monde fait la gueule a se restaurant. Bref, avec les prix assez élevé , un bon service amical et efficace ne devrait pas être trop demander."}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafes in Montreal! I love everything about this place. The overall look of the cafe is breathtaking. The vines, tables, the wall of candles...everything is beautiful. Onto the most important part: the food! I loved everything I had off their menu, especially the different pizzas they offer. In my opinion, this cafe makes the best lattes. I have never been disappointed. The service has always been good and pretty fast. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Waited 30 min for a seat and saw at least 5 people take a seat that should have been mine. Unfortunate because the place looked promising."}
{"text":"The space is beautiful, the menu is creative, and the staff us charming. We had a great brunch at Cafe Parvis recently. I loved how much warmth and greenery filled the space while it was gross cold and snowy outside. A perfect little escape in a great neighborhood.   I can't recommend the brunch pizza enough. SO GOOD. Needing a few good shots for your Insta? Go here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the pizza with watercress, avocado and feta, it was divine. Staff was hip but friendly,, fast service and cool vibe."}
{"text":"the ambiance and atmosphere are the best things about this place. closely followed by the service.  missed the mark on the food. nothing great, nothing bad."}
{"text":"Great little spot for brunch especially if you want to get away from the tourist traffic. Seems to cater primarily to locals and travelers in the know. Great ambiance and good coffee."}
{"text":"They have a creative menu. I ordered the pizza with bechamel sauce, bacon, endive, gruyere, pear and hazelnuts. It was really good! Their pizza bread was like crunchy flatbread, I liked it a lot better than regular rising pizza dough. I'd eat the bread on its own and enjoy it almost as much as the pizza. The mix of nuttiness from the toasted hazelnut, saltiness from the crispy bacon, and the sweetness from the pear and the caramelized endives was suuuper nice.   None of the toppings were overwhelming and everything blended nicely.  My only complaint is that the portions were too small compared to its price, I felt they were too sparing with the toppings. Either go a bit more ham with the toppings or lower the prices by a few dollars. The people and the place were really nice, with plants and terrace at the front and the inside felt really cozy. I recommend!"}
{"text":"It seems like people have mistaken \"Instagrammableness\" for quality here.  The good parts: - Accommodating staff. They handled our large group of 9 (which included people arriving late) without making mistakes. And didn't hesitate to prepare separate checks for each person. - High-quality ingredients, especially fresh veggies - Nice (if loud) live piano music  The bad parts: - The table we were seated at seemed designed to hurt people's knees, at least at our level of crowdedness - They were out of lobster, but did not offer to reduce the price of the seafood pizza - The (English) menu is not written optimally for customers who don't speak French, especially for people who speak English as a second language. The pizzas don't have names, just lists of ingredients. Some things are still in French, e.g. the menu says \"cidre\" (pronounced \"SEE-drh\") and the waitress did not understand what was meant by \"cider\" (pronounced \"SAI-dur\"), and the beer sizes are listed as \"V\" and \"P\" rather than writing out \"glass\" and \"pint\" in English. Of course some amount of communication struggle is expected when French is the commonly-spoken language and customers don't speak French, but this menu design was not helping. - My pizza (bacon and Brussels sprouts) did not have a substantial enough crust to support the greasy ingredients on top of it, and the bottom was somewhat burnt. I was not able to pick up the slices of pizza until I had cut off the inner half of each with a knife and fork (otherwise the middle would just flop down and the toppings would slide off). It seemed like a failed attempt at a New York style thin crust pizza, but the crust was brittle rather than flexible and chewy. The toppings themselves were tasty, but I shouldn't have to eat a pizza with a knife and fork unless it's deep dish. Especially not if I'm paying $17 for a personal pizza."}
{"text":"I went to cafe parvis for lunch after hearing so much about this cafe. I was very happy to see that it's walking distance from my work. Arriving there, I saw that it was quite full and I had to wait to be seated. I decided to be seated inside. I loved the decor with the fresh plants hanging and the old walls as well as furnitures. It gives you a vintage feeling which made me feel happy.   I went through the menu and the pizza was very interesting as they had so many fresh ingredients such as kale, cod fish etc... the waiter came and took my order with which I was pleased but he mentioned that they're tiny pieces and I was quite disappointed. One piece is $8 which is not very filling and I found it quite expensive   After 10-15 minutes of wait, my food arrived and at first bite, I found that my pizza crust was not fresh and felt really hard on the teeth, I'm assuming that they were leftovers and that they just served it by warming it up again and I was very disappointed by it. I thought the food is fresh and good as this is what I have heard but going in today made me realized that I spent $25 including for nothing as it wasn't good at all.   I will not return."}
{"text":"This place has a very aesthetic decor with hanging plants and nice natural lighting. Lunch was not a decently sized portion and service could have been friendlier. Good place if you are not that hungry and looking for a cute atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Sweet spot to get some work done, wouldn't call it magical (sounds like a rainforest by the description) but nice decor with hanging vines in some parts of this urbanite loft style cafe. Slightly overpriced and small portion pizzas but overall good spot for a bite and some work."}
{"text":"Le café Parvis, c'est avant tout un bel endroit. Mais quand je dis beau, je veux dire PINTEREST NEXT LEVEL beau. Tu y rentres et tu as envie de tout photographier et de ramener 2-3 morceaux de décor en même temps. Le personnel est gentil et le menu est alléchant. Mon seul bémol: Les prix sont définitivement plus dans la catégorie restaurant que café, ne vous attendez donc pas à ressortir avec une facture en bas de 10$, même si vous ne prenez rien à boire. Rien n'empêche que les salades sont fraîches et les pizzas sont originales et finement exécutées. Niveau café, l'espresso est crémeux et chocolaté, faisant de chaque breuvage chaud une petite merveille.   En gros, si tu es un gars, c'est l'endroit parfait où amener ta date pour l'impressionner avant d'aller voir un film au Cinéma de la Banque Scotia. Si tu es étudiant/e, l'espace est tout à fait adéquat pour t'installer avec ton ordinateur et faire tes travaux en sirotant un café ou un petit cocktail maison. Si tu as faim pendant ta session de magasinage avec tes amis ou ta petite sur, l'endroit est tout indiqué avec ses mignonnes pizzas à partager et sa menue carte des vins. Olé!"}
{"text":"Food first - cos let's be honest that's why you're here. They serve salads and pizzas and they're delicious. The salads are hearty and filling. They're actually full of goodness. For two of us we shared: mushroom pizza with Jerusalem artichoke purée, Brie & honey, and the beet salad with spinach & ricotta and a cumin vinaigrette. ONE HUGE PET PEEVE which I wish in hindsight i had mentioned while I was there - the salad came with walnuts and this was not stipulated on the menu. While I can't eat walnuts I'd rather be inconvenienced and pick them out than ask them to throw away a perfectly good salad. Not into food waste like that and I had a work around. But still, it's annoying - I feel like a walnut (especially the generous amount and all crushed up that was there) should not have been a menu oversight. Please Parvis put that on your menu or stipulate there are nuts in your dishes! No one likes a walnut surprise. Well not no-one - but not me.  Anyway - everything else was great - and the service was done with a smile.   Great cocktail menu too! Cocktails are $10-11.   Ok second - the actual setting is stunning. Spacy, airy, high ceilings, full of plants. Hidden away behind st Catherine so if you're looking for a bite off the beaten path away from the mess of downtown - then this is a great spot. Serious plant envy too. A great date spot. Lovely when the weather is nice when their windows are open or when their terrace is set up.   1 salad, 1 pizza, 1 cocktail + service + tip was around $50. The food was good (not mind blowing out of this world like nothing I've ever had before - but very very very tasty and I would go back), the service was faultless and the interior is waaaaay beautiful. If that's in your budget - go here!  Could have got a 5th star but - walnut."}
{"text":"Had brunch there last weekend and I was reeeeeeally disappointed. We were a party of 6, celebrating my girlfriend's birthday and one of our friends brought cake... A tiny cake from Première Moisson. After all of us had eaten, we decided to serve the cake and, as soon as we opened the box, one of the waiters came by and said he would have to charge a \"cake fee\". Well, that sucks, but whatever... What is it, like 10 bucks or something? And then the guy said they'd charge us 45 (FORTY-F*ING-FIVE) dollars to eat the cake there. AKA twice as much as the cake had cost in the first place.  Personally, I am totally against charging this type of bullshit fee as, in my opinion, pleasing the customer is the primary mission of any business. Anyway... I understand the restaurant's point of view, that they will have to wash a few extra dishes and bla-bla-bla, so charging a symbolic fee still seems acceptable. 45 bucks is just not acceptable. After the very embarrassing situation, we decided not to pay the fee and went back to Première Moisson to eat our cake.  And what really pissed us off is that they could have said that they had this policy from the beginning, so we could decide whether we'd have brunch there or somewhere else, but they didn't.  They didn't get our 45 bucks and lost 6 customers just like that."}
{"text":"Les pizzas et les salades sont très bonnes. Mention pour la pizza chèvre et crème d'épinards et la salade de betteraves. Les plats sont parfaitement assaisonnés et les intelligents mélanges d'ingrédients permettent de relever toutes les saveurs. Service agréable et lieu sympa. Très bon café aussi bien pour le midi que pour le soir."}
{"text":"Was brought here by a friend who's visited Montreal frequently and really loved it! I wouldn't of found it on my own, because of it being tucked away on a back street. But the atmosphere in that place is really great, servers were warm and welcoming and menu was small but delicious! Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"the environment of this place is very good, they have many potted plants, the table near the window have good view. The food there is delicious, good place for pizzas."}
{"text":"An unexpected find behind a historic (and sort of creepy) church downtown and in the middle of a massive and dusty construction zone. Don't let that deter you. Lovely atmosphere, many plants, high ceilings, big windows, and an attractive, hipster heavy crowd. We sat at the bar and had one of the best Palomas I'd ever had in North or South America. I had the beet and pear salad, which was decent and healthy, before having the soup du jour, an excellent tomato with chorizo soup that I'd never had but would order again in a New York minute. It was tomato heavy with a spicy kick from little bits of chorizo. Also at our table was a medium sized portion of pork on top of a hash brown with eggs surrounding (this was brunch, after all), this too made us smile. Service was friendly and generally attentive. A very pleasant place to spend a lazy weekend afternoon."}
{"text":"We we're looking for a light dinner after a day of driving. This was the perfect place with very good food and service. Ambience in this place is chic."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and when we first came in, we were hesitant since almost all the tables in front were reserved but we luckily got seated right away in the back, which was near a super cute couch setup. The decor here is really charming and at first glance, I was worried I wouldn't find anything to order on their menu since I tend to like classic hearty breakfast fare but eventually realized I might like the breakfast pizza or the strata but decided to go with the pizza and I was really pleasantly surprised! The dough was really good and I ended up eating the entire thing. It was topped with black beans, avocado, cheese of course, a fried egg, and delicious chorizo and you have to understand that I don't normally like to eat black beans, avocado, and chorizo.. yet it was delicious! The crab dish the others in my party looked really good as well. The fresh orange juice/grapefruit combo I ordered was disappointingly sour compared to the one I had elsewhere the day before but this is a perfect place to start your day like we did!"}
{"text":"I pass this gorgeous floral café on a daily basis, aweing at its colourful botanical terrasse. As I work in the area, some colleagues and I decided to go for lunch one Friday afternoon. The interior is just as beautiful as the exterior, dim lighting with floral motifs on the walls and vines hanging above - it is as if you have entered a secret garden!  At first, we were rudely told by the girl at the door that there's no space on the terrasse and to sit inside. We were taken right into the back of the restaurant, past the bar area and close to the bathrooms. It was dark and a little claustrophobic... perhaps great during the colder months but it's summer! We want sun! Finally after asking her to try again, we got a great place on the terrasse - closer to Furco (which they share the terrasse with).  The lunch menu was short and simple with unique choices of pizzas & salads. We all requested the soup of the day (Gazpacho!) only to be told it was finished... very disappointing seeing as we were there around 12.30pm! Our waiter then explained how their lunch system works - which was confusing. The pizza on the menu refers to 1 slice and if we are hungry, to make it double or quadruple portions... same with the salads. Reading the reviews below, I think the whole pizzas are served during dinner time? At lunch, the pizza slices were already prepared beforehand and comes up to about 10-15$ per slice... a bit pricey for one pizza square? We all went ahead and ordered our individual portions - I had a roast vegetable pizza with caramelized onions, ricotta and balsamic... despite it being small, it was super delicious and unusual.. I savoured every single bite. I complimented the pizza to the waiter and he mentioned that their menu changes every couple of months, so it is definitely worth checking out the weird & wonderful combinations they come up with!  Overall, I had a great time but will not be back for lunch. The menu was overpriced for pizzas that were prepared way in advance and served as a slice (and not too warm either). They should also prepare a larger quantity of soup seeing as they have a line-up almost on a daily basis! Will definitely be back to check out the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Brilliant choice of a half dozen delicious breakfasts -- highly recommend trying the breakfast pizza, which is excellent for brunch. Incredible cappuccino and very good latte would be worth stopping by, all on their own. Really great, if somewhat overworked serving staff, and while service isn't quick, wait time is certainly reasonable. Marvelous decor is a fusion of the original factory building with modern café touches. Lots of space but popular. Currently a lot of local construction, especially out on the street, but we didn't have any trouble finding the door (do know where you're headed)."}
{"text":"Cafe Parvis is located slightly weirdly as it is next to a church and several parking garages but conveniently a block from the metro! The ambiance is NICE and decor is very lush with greenery. Their music playlist of mostly r&b tunes was also great and always something I personally enjoy. Prices were a little steep but the portions and taste of the flatbread pizza were pretty good. I'm unsure if I would come back for a full meal due to the price but perhaps for a drink at night or a cappuccino!"}
{"text":"Read the other reviews. Gorgeous place.   That's otherwise it.  Service was baffling. It's 3 PM and it's dead inside (and slow out). We ask to be sat by the window (and lovely plants!). Told they can't pull tables together so we make do and form a semi circle around two tables.  Then told by a second waiter they can't serve dessert or alcohol without an entree. Alcohol perhaps understandable but dessert?   After we finally get our iced coffee orders in (no desserts), we're told by a third waiter we can't sit by the window, that we need to move to bar stools. We left and went to Universel, enjoyed a beautiful decor, and great service.  Not worth your time. There's other places downtown with lovely plants and decor where you can get a bite to eat and/or drinks."}
{"text":"The food is good and the place itself is beautiful but the service is so bad. It's like it's just run by a group of friends who like to stand around and talk to each other. I've gone here probably 4 times and every time my order has either gotten lost or my waiter has taken 30 minutes to notice our table. There is so much potential for this place but the staff needs improvement."}
{"text":"Est-ce le plus beau café de Montréal? Peut-être bien.  C'est magnifique. Il y a tellement de verdure, un décor exceptionnel, il n'y a que l'extérieur qui est perpétuellement triste à cause des travaux, mais ça, est-ce que c'est la faute du Parvis? Non.  Un latte soya pour moi, excellent, tout comme la pizza... qui était tiède, mais qui goûtait le paradis. J'aurais pris un paradis plus chaud, disons.  Accueil immédiat et courtois. Je me suis assise au bar où j'ai été servie rapidement. La serveuse était très attentionnée malgré la quantité de gens qu'il y avait à l'intérieur (pour vrai, chapeau, c'est sûr que je perdrais la tête) et avait un sens de l'humour aiguisé. Deux qualités que j'apprécie beaucoup!   Le Parvis est dur à trouver, mais une fois que c'est fait, on ne l'oublie jamais. Longue vie au Parvis!"}
{"text":"Came for Sunday brunch with the gf while visiting from out of town on a recommendation from family. The place was beautiful inside and out. Very industrial feel juxtaposed with flowers, potted plants and vines leading from roof to patio floor. Ordered the breakfast pizza (potatoes cheese eggs mushroom sausage), vegetarian sandwich (eggplant alfalfa sprouts tomato in a croissant) banana bread french toast. Food was excellent with a terrific balance in flavor. Very good tea. Frothy juices with very good touch of sweetness hint of tart. Would revisit.  Only caveat.. construction nearby is unsightly"}
{"text":"Food is very good, had grilled octopus salad which was totally delicious, small portion tho. I could have eaten easily 2 :) .  The Chai Latte is just perfect!"}
{"text":"I like that the menu changes because it means there's always something new to try! I've liked everything I've had here before. The portions are smaller than most restaurants but good too not feel too full afterwards. Pricey compared to others as well but the food feels unique and quality. Service can be a bit slow because they can get very busy but the staff is helpful about the menu. Cafe drinks here are good too! The patio is also very nice when the weather's good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? (????????????????)?  ???????????????????????????????confit????tartar, ????????????????????????????????????  ??: ??????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and pastries. Note that on weekdays it's counter service only until 11:30am, when the lunch menu starts."}
{"text":"I feel like I have struck a goldmine with this cafe. I recently shifted dangerously close to this cafe and tried it few weeks back- I ordered the chicken and waffles and propogandized my friends to order the pizzas.  The fresh ingredients and the surprisingly well balanced flavors teleported me to food heaven (I instantly came back and sent details of the dish on my family newsletter)  This place is like Disneyland for crazy foodies- the ingredients are odd but when they put it all together it's just a masterpiece. So far I have tried the chicken sandwich, waffles and chicken, watercress pizza, lemon ricotta poppy seed cake, croissant and I kid you not- NOTHING has disappointed.   I highly recommend this place to everyone, it has cute interiors and the whole plants and rustic furniture adds a vintage charm to the space. The staff are more than helpful with a pasted kind smile.   For sure, I'm going to keep going cause I'm determined to find out atleast one dish they haven't perfected (that's my excuse)   Great place, insanely good food!"}
{"text":"Good food, and (to an American) interesting plates. The baked egg with pesto ragu was delicious, and very filling. Cool atmosphere, and the others in my party really liked their coffee's."}
{"text":"In a desolate commercial sea that is downtown Montreal, you take a turn down some random streets and voila, Cafe Parvis is there to save your soul from Starbucks. But wait! There's more. Pizza kind of more. The best possible kind of edible more one could hope for. As a half-Italian myself, I'd say it's not Italian-style pizza. More North American. Anyway, the food is great. Coffee is good. Wait staff, a big bagged. Not a spot I'd go out of the way to go to but a god sent for the area. Same owners as Furco. The more you know!"}
{"text":"This picturesque cafe is the perfect place to have a slice of pizza. The hanging vines and cute patio make it the perfect go-to summer place! The food is pricey but delicious, I recommend the pizza!"}
{"text":"Café Parvis, c'est un lieu caché du Centre-Ville. Quand je dis caché, c'est que non seulement on ne tombe pas dessus par hasard mais en plus, il fait partit d'une zone en perpétuels travaux (comme bien souvent dans le CV de Montréal). Grâce à une profusion de végétaux décoratifs, ce café contre la grisaille de la zone!  A l'intérieur, l'espace est grand et aéré et toujours aussi végétal.  Après un début un peu médiocre, longue attente pour la prise de commande et pareil pour recevoir nos boissons, nos plats nous ont fait oubliés ces petits désagréments de départ.  La rillette de saumon fumé était d'une saveur extraordinaire avec un relish en assaisonnement qui allait avec à merveille.  Le reste de nos plats étaient bons (sandwich déj au végépaté dans un croissant et un uf béné sur galette de pomme de terre avec des choux de Bruxelles) et nos boissons chaudes aussi.  La note n'est pas salée finalement car la qualité des plats est au rendez-vous et le lieu agréable."}
{"text":"Excellent cold brew coffee, but the pizza..meh. The interior looks European and bourgeois. If you enjoy Instagram more than the food, this is the place to be. Very friendly staff though."}
{"text":"Vraiment déçu de la place, j'y suis allé à deux reprises dans les derniers mois et ce fût une expérience désagréable à chaque fois. Jamais vu un staff aussi bête et désintéressé du client, et à 6.75$ pour un café filtre et un muffin, c'est clairement inacceptable. Le café était ok, mais rien pour écrire à sa mère, et le muffin (qui n'en était pas un, on appelle ça un pain aux bananes) était sec.  Le décors est ben beau, mais quand tout le reste tombe à plat, ça ne change pas grand chose."}
{"text":"Pretty! New from the Furco folks with brunches and nice coffee on the menu. There are a number of tasty pizza options served with slices in a pile on a cutting board for sharing. There are also these delicious sounding salads on the menu that are served up in single, double or 4 person portions which I will totally go back for. There seems to be a rotating selection of house organic wines on offer along with a couple ok beers.   There was no cocktail menu available despite my super kind and funny waitress asking around for one for me. The other thing I found off-putting was the insistent way another staff members swept all around me, not making eye contact with me, while I sat there breathing dust. Personally I'd say: hey maybe skip sweeping a table if it's already occupied and focus on making customers feel comfortable. The rest of the staff did this is spades, they were funny, easy-going, chill. I think this is a new place working some kinks out but an exceptional addition to the downtown options."}
{"text":"super pizzas, salades et ambiance. la deco est aussi magnifique et les employés vraiment sympas! déjà ma deuxième fois ici depuis mon récent déménagement à Montréal, et sûrement pas la dernière! je conseille vivement la pizza poire ou bien celle avec les aubergines, allez y a plusieurs, c'est mieux pour avoir la chance de goûter à tout!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is really well decorated on the inside, and the food is really good. The salad with beets, goat cheese, and walnuts is more like beets, goat cheese, and walnuts with some salad, which was awesome. The mushroom pizza was delicious too, although the crust was a little thick. Sharing the pizza with two others and having my own salad was plenty of food, so despite the above average prices, it's actually a decent amount of food."}
{"text":"Little hidden gem in a construction area. It's a coffee shop but they also serve food. I got here for lunch, ordered a pizza. The waitress was very kind, she translated all the items on the menu to English to me and I went with her recommendation of the pizza.  The pizza was really well executed, so many different layers of taste. It got the crunch pickle and onion, really soft potato, chewy beef slices (kind of like prosciutto) and the pizza bread tasted like baguette, crispy outside and soft inside.  Costed me about $20 for just the pizza. A little overpriced for a small pizza. I understand the concept but I don't buy it.  There were also lots of plants inside the restaurant, cool decor, really refreshing.  Not your typical coffee shop nor your typical pizza place. However, it was kind of dark inside and this location can be tough to find. Take it as an adventure :P"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been twice, once for drinks and again for drinks and a meal. Their drinks are outstanding and the pizza I had was delicious especially if you put that oil they have on it. It tastes so good! Ill definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Was so impressed by this place. Their margarita pizza is phenomenal. The deco is great in a cool unpretentious way and our waiter/bartender was very chill. Had great wine in a cool ambiance. Sort of a hidden gem, this place is a new favourite!!"}
{"text":"Found this little cafe as recommendation of our hotel. What great food and coffee. Love the quaintness of the place and so relaxing. Does get busy but wait time isn't that bad"}
{"text":"Ouh la! Définitivement une place que je vais refaire d'içi peu! L'endroit est tout simplement parfait ! Pour ceux qui ont visité le Tommy Cafe, eh bien c'est le même genre, avec 2x plus de verdures! Bien que le service soit un peu boboche, le café était délicieux et le croissant aux amandes aussi! A noter que les brunchs ne sont que la fin de semaine et que le diners commencent seulement à 11:30 !!"}
{"text":"All I had was a salad and a glass of wine (the pizzas I saw looked horrifying - one featuring cheddar and green pea sour cream). So narrow it to there. Couscous salad was a miserable small bowl of mush. The texture a blend between oatmeal and hummus; the flavor a mix of bitter chard and despair. ...for $22CAD.   Server didn't seem interested in why I barely touched it.   There's something good going on here - or all these people just hate themselves. Remains a mystery to me.   This town has beautiful food. Can't say this place is worth the risk. Move along."}
{"text":"Lovely cafe with vintage organic touch, relaxing and chill. With the plants hanging over the ceiling and falling freely above the table was indeed unique and authentic.Went on Easter weekend only special menu is available. Start with juice of the day, has beets apple carrot orange Im super happy with it, refreshing like sunshine in a glass. Had the quiche with mushroom spinach fiddle head. The presentation is lovely with all the colors really stand out like a mini garden. Couple of my friends had the almond croissant, their face was light up after having the first bite lol. The girl from France says it remind her of home. Can't wait to go back to try more delicious creations."}
{"text":"A very nice place to grab some healthy foods. They mainly offer pizza and salad. The salad was very filling and clean. The wait isn't too long as people go in and out pretty quick. This place is pretty comfortable in terms of sitting space. The pizza is yums but for the price of the portion, it may not be as worth it to others. The salads on the other hand is pretty filling for the price."}
{"text":"Love the decor and the ambiance but just not a fan of their coffee.   Been here twice for their coffee and the beans used are on the fruity side which is not my favorite. I usually like to add a little bit of sugar to my cortado just to bring out the flavor of the beans but the sugar just kills the coffee when fruity beans are used.  The place has big wooden table everywhere and big windows so lots of sunlight :)  I have seen their pizza and they look really delicious although I haven't tried them myself."}
{"text":"L'ambiance est bonne. J'ai aimé le look de l'endroit avec les plantes. La nourriture était bonne. En temps normal, j'aurais mis 4 étoiles. Mais le service n'était pas très bon. On a commencé par nous dire qu'il y aurait un 2e service et qu'il faudrait quitter avant 19h30. Puis le serveur à oublié la commande d'un des membres de notre groupe. L'assiette est arrivée à 19h alors qu'on avait déjà tous terminé de manger. Le souper aura pris presque 2 heures. Et à la fin, il y avait des erreurs sur les factures."}
{"text":"Favourite pizza in Montreal. Great patio too!"}
{"text":"First time in Montreal and relied on my yelp family to recommend a great place for my first night out - and you held your end of the agreement!  Food, staff, atmosphere - everything was amazing!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious espresso drinks in a airy and hip dining room. Stone and hanging plants prevail, and with its shabby chic plaster and smoked glass,  one is left with an austere yet quirky impression. Kurt staff and tight service. In the heart of downtown but an escape from the bustle."}
{"text":"I went ti Café Parviz towards the end of summer and I was really excited by it as I heard great things about the place.   Their breakfast options are limited and tend to be more and the healthy side. I chose a type of egg dish and when I received if I was disappointed that the actual hard boiled egg was cold. Also their drink and not good, the hot chocolate taste more like water and powder and again it was warm not HOT. The croissant was not fresh way too crispy and hard.  Although and the plates looked good and had nice visuals on the plate, but the taste did not meet my expectations.  The positive about the place, it is smack downtown maybe a 1 minute walk to the bay, very well decorated, it had a nice friendly vibe, nicely decorated with plants everywhere."}
{"text":"Favourite Cafe/brunch place. Perfectly sized portions and excerpt prices.  Espresso is excellent with subtle herbal notes.  Atmosphere is perfect. Can be a little noisy but that's okay, you can just look around at all the plants instead. The people here are worldly and intelligent as well. 5/5!"}
{"text":"Love the interior - it has this warm and lush atmosphere that is so comforting in the winter. The food is absolutely delicious and the service is so sweet and attentive.   Great place for a quick drink, a cozy lunch or an intimate dinner."}
{"text":"Café Parvis, très belle endroit bonne ambiance, bonne nourriture, mais les prix un peu élevé 8,5$ pour une petit pars de pizza et 16$ pour un bol sa salade. Mais le goût y été. Très bon café et biscuit."}
{"text":"The coffee was really good, the food was ok. My sister and I went for breakfast and tasted the two options on the menu, the croissant sandwich and the yogourt with granola.  We were really disappointed with the service. The waiter forgot my plate, I had to tell him when my sister had already finished hers. He told me that when he finished preparing my sandwich, he couldn't remember me. \"It has just been waiting on the counter for 2 min, it should still be hot\". That was a first error that I can forgive, but it got worse. Later my sister ordered a filtered coffee to go before we left. He asked her if it was ok if sher had to wait like 5 min... and added \"come and see me if I forget your coffee\". He did forget her and had a kind of sarcastic attitude afterwards. What kind of service is this?  I had heard really good comments about this place and dealing with this employee was really frustrating."}
{"text":"I love finding hidden gems around Montreal! This place was recommended by a friend. Decently priced. Beautiful artistic tree decorations all over the restaurant. It literally feels like you're outside on the patio eating. I had a nice glass of red wine, Côtes du Rhône, which was paired beautifully with my Shredded Swiss cheese with arugula pizza. This place is a must you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved this cafe!  I love the decor with all the plants trailing down from the ceiling. The scone was magnificent and the almond milk cappuccino was just perfect!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed! Came here for lunch when I was in Montreal last month and fell in love with the space--an industrial environment with plants hanging down from the ceiling. For lunch, had delicious ginger beer and one of the best salads I've ever had in my life--so good that I drove the leftovers all the way back to Massachusetts to eat for lunch at work the next day! The tiniest bit pricy, but the portions are big, and the ingredients are very high quality. It's a little bit hidden behind construction right now, but there were scores of people having lunch there on a Sunday--we were lucky to get a table for 4 right away. Highly recommended for lunch!"}
{"text":"Enfin pris le temps de venir manger au café Parvis.Belle experience avec mon copain cet apres midi déjeuner lunch ; la pizza déjeuner,  les ingrédients de ce plat étaient top qualité et la pâte légère et aérée. Staff sympa on y retourne!"}
{"text":"Simple and creative lunch menu which consists of light and healthy meals. Had the salmon gravlax pizza and the zucchini salad with a yummy lemonade. Portions are decent and affordable. Lovely space decorated with pretty flowers and lots of greenery. The staff is pleasant and so are the playlists. Have yet to try their breakfast or dinner menus but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cafe Parvis is a great location, very rustic and flowery overall the i found the salads, the tomato appetizers and the desserts realllly good but the pizza's are alright and overpriced for what it is ! We were a group of 10-15 people the pizza came in right on time for all of us to be able to share the meal ! I had a cod pizza which was a unique topping :)! I really enjoyed the peacan pie and the poppy seed lemon pie .. The terasse is lovely but its surrounding is all under construction and it is hard to find the place, especially that next door is a coffe shop/restaurant of the same sort... Today was 40 degrees but unfortunately  the inside seating was not equiped of an AC .. At least didnt feel like it .. I might give it a second try"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a big one for salads, but Parvis does these weirdly inventive salads that you can't help ordering. They're colourful, delicious, and healthy I GUESS but I'm mostly ordering them because I'm not a huge pizza gal.   Having said that, the pizzas are good too - one large slice, usually topped with things like eggplant and prosciutto, so expect a slightly ~fancier~ pizza!  The tea is also lovely, and I would definitely recommend the hojicha (it's my favourite)!"}
{"text":"The arugula pizza (which I ordered) is amazing! I was worried about the sour cream when I ordered it but it is not overpowering.   Would definitely recommend this restaurant as a great place to go on a dinner date! The restaurant's ambience and aesthetic is warm and romantic esp at dinnertime"}
{"text":"This rates as a hidden treasure.  I love the big windows, the vintage fixtures, marble bar, and mottled paint and plaster walls.  I almost always go for whatever breakfast pizza is being offered.  The cappuccino is excellent as well.  I hope this place lasts forever."}
{"text":"Un peu overated. JE suis allé brunché. J'ai pris une tortillaz aux oeuf et tomate. C'était une quiche. Très léger et assez bon. Le genre de truc qui fait très régime.  Je reconnais l'aspect intéressant de faire un déjeuner plutôt léger pour les gens qui n'ont pas très faim.   Néanmoins, ce fût respectable, le café était très bien, le service encore mieux et chaleureux. Nous étions avec la jeune fille de 2 ans de mon ami et ils ont été très gentil  malgré le jeune âge.   Je crois que c'est intéressant mais sans plus à mon humble avis, un peu cher payé dans une bâtisse historique et belle de Montréal."}
{"text":"We were so excited to visit Cafe Parvis. I found their website before we came to visit Montreal from Ohio, and the look and vibe matched our tastes exactly.  We walked in and the decor lived up to it's expectations. It was urban and rustic at the same time. Loved it. The food was good - the salads are super unique and portion sizes were good without being too big. Everything was good. The biggest issue I had with the whole experience was the service:  We walked in and they sat us at a bar. My boyfriend ordered the black bean burger and I ordered a salad and a small latte. The food came, but I did not receive my latte. I told the gentleman (who was not our original server) that I had ordered a latte and he said that he thought that it was being made then. About 10 minutes went by and the latte did not come. At this point our server had not came back to even check on us, so I didn't know how to tell them about it. I said something to the gentleman who ran our food as he was passing by and he said he would look into it. Our server came back and said that he didn't understand that I wanted a latte and that he would get it in soon. About 5 more minutes went by and we were finished with our food. Our server had not returned and so I grabbed the gentleman that ran our food, once again, and told him not to worry about the latte, we were finished. He turned around an said, 'Oh but it's ready now.'  At that point we were in a awkward position of staying and drinking a latte after we had finished our meal, even after we said that we no longer wanted it. When they gave us the bill, they had removed the latte from the bill (good), but never once addressed the issue or apologized - which was a knock on the experience for me."}
{"text":"After the line-up was too long at our first choice of restaurant my aunt and I came here since it was nearby and the wait for a table was much more reasonable.  The restaurant features an open kitchen and is a really inviting space with lots of natural light.  It gets busy at lunch so a reservation would probably be a good idea.   The menu here is small and focused.  You can get salads and/or pizzas.  We decided to each get a salad and I also added a braised beef empanada to that.  Now salads don't exactly evoke much excitement but these ones aren't your typical salad.  My lentil salad was loaded with a bunch of different vegetables and I really enjoyed the dressing.  I also tried a mouthful of my aunt's beet salad which had a yogurt dressing and that one was pretty good too.  My empanada was very crispy on the outside.  The bill for two before tip was $38 (and that also included a coffee) so it is what you would expect to pay downtown.  The service was the low point of the meal for me.  First up we waited a long time for our food to be brought out and when it finally did come the arrival of the dishes were staggered.  We also never got any refills of our water which would have been appreciated.  While I really enjoyed the food I was a little turned off by the service.  It was also really noisy inside the restaurant and I did not enjoy having to speak really loudly to be able to make conversation.  It's an okay option if you're in the area but I would suggest looking elsewhere first."}
{"text":"Petit bijou du centre-ville, on y mange très bien pour un prix raisonnable. Avec son décor digne des couvertures de magazines ont peut y rester longtemps à rêver. Leurs limonades maison sont délicieuses tout comme leurs pizzas. Je le recommande fortement."}
{"text":"Our server was so sweet and polite. She recommended the telaggio app and we got the red cabbage salad (so good!) and margherita pizza. It was perfect. Alll SO delicious. The atmosphere is great and the space is beautiful."}
{"text":"Yummy fresh ingredients. Pizza and a salad for 20 bucks with tip- not the best value, but incredible taste!!! Worth it."}
{"text":"A hip Montreal cafe filled with greenery - what better way to spend a Monday morning? I got an Americano and a buttery croissant. Both of them were perfect. I'll definitely come back! I just wish that they had a more extensive weekday breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Quite busy at lunch time but fortunately there are a second room to cater clients. The staff is friendly and the dishes and drinks are served very fast! Ordered 3 slices of pizza of different flavours and like the one with mushroom, mozzarella and caramelized onion the most! Their salad is good too. Their cappuccino comes with a foamy white heart and it was indeed cute. The price is fair and I would come back!"}
{"text":"A very cute and chic cafe. Wonderful decor and atmosphere. I don't usually drink / enjoy coffee, but I ordered the cappuccino and honestly loved it. Had the banana bread with caramel butter and strawberries - also delicious. Got there only 20 minutes after opening on a Saturday morning and it was already pretty busy, and got much busier around noon. Definitely would recommend getting there early to beat the rush. Am also definitely coming back in order to try one of their cocktails since that menu looked phenomenal (and likely also for other regular cafe desires). Was a little more difficult to find, mostly since I'm new to the city and there was construction going on in the street and around the area."}
{"text":"Delicious! I will be back. The cafe is beautifully decorated, reminiscent of European bistros.  I ordered the breakfast pizza (off the brunch menu). I typically am not a big fan of pizza, but the dough is light and perfectly crispy (not too much not too little). My sister ordered the poached eggs (also off the brunch menu). It comes with a puree of butternut squash and potatoes. It was out of this world. Next time I come back I will order that dish! :)"}
{"text":"I like this place because of good coffee and great service! I ordered a latte and a cookie. The taste and the art of the latte were really good! The cookie Oreo was normal. Before placing an order, I was playing cellphone while waiting a customer before me. I didn't realize when that person had finished ordering, so I was still staring at my phone after that person left. The Batista waited me very patiently until I found out by my self. I'm so sorry about this and I appreciate a lot his patience!"}
{"text":"What a cute and romantic place. The ambiance of this place is amazing. We went there on a snowy winter night but I can only imagine what it would be like dining on their summer terrace. Their salads are extremely creative. The pizza is so delish - including the crust, don't throw it out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is alright...very limited menu and the food is mediocre. The setting is nice and very hipster decor...but there are so many delicious places for brunch/light fare in Montreal, this place just does not make the cut."}
{"text":"I met some friends for a quiet night. This place was perfect, nice tone down atmosphere so we coukd talk (looks perfect also for dates), great Pizzas (recommend) and well fir us that was enough. Also located 2 min from a metro which always a plus for people from different part of MTL. Overall I really enjoyed my visit :)"}
{"text":"We totally stumbled upon this restaurant as we were taking a leisurely stroll though the city. If you can impress me with your decor, I'll like you a whole lot. If you can impress me with your food AND your decor? I'll like you bunches beyond bunches beyond bunches. And now I'm crushing hard on the bar and the vibe in this spot. Totes Barcrush. It's just so sexy.   So, I ordered a salad. It was loaded with capers, fingerling potatoes, crispy prosciutto, hard boiled egg, romain lettuce and a dill/dijon/goodness, dressing. Man, this salad was solid. I could eat that thing all day long. The dishes my friends got looked delicious, but, I won't expand on that because I looked up, looked back down & went to town on that salad. The flavors they merge together somehow work and it kind of humbles your tastebuds, in a phenomenal way.  But listen, the vibe and decor in this joint makes me feel good and I think it might do the same to you."}
{"text":"Plants??? Hanging from the ceiling??? THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL DECOR!!! Comfortable little café, serene atmosphere, agreeable lighting, it's a nice place to go eat a piece of pizza, have a drink and chat or work. Prices are reasonable, pizzas have fancy stuff, salads too. May be a bit crowded when lunch time arrives but who cares! Worth it!"}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs endroits en ville pour travailler, manger un petit quelque chose ou prendre un verre.   Heures tranquilles: 7h-11h30 & 14h-17h Heures fiesta: le reste du temps"}
{"text":"Sandwich déjeuner was okay. Service très lent.  The decor is actually cool, too bad there are construction works there currently."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite lunch spots in town - affordable, simple, and tasty! It's a bit hidden and may be hard to find, and the line can get long on the weekends, but it's totally worth it. I'm a New York-style pizza snob but the crust/bread they serve their \"pizza\" on is sooo good."}
{"text":"One of these where there's always a caveat attached at the end of whatever compliment I have. As in: I think this place is great and you'll enjoy it, BUT I'm confident something will bother you throughout the time you're there.   As in: I love the industrial greenhouse deco (another reviewer called it a \"treehouse\", which I think is an accurate description of the outdoor-sy feeling of the place). And the L-shaped bar and open kitchen I think is a smart way to delineate the space. But the doorway's a mix of heated humidity and chlorine that conjures the appetizing memories of an indoor public pool changing room. Luckily that didn't extend into the restaurant.   As in: The slightly expensive pizza is so worth it. Especially for its fluffy and airy thin crust. And I'm saying this having tired only 1 lukewarm slice of my friend's mushroom pizza she couldn't finish (I THOUGHT SHE WOULD NEVER ASK). But, my Pimm's cup seemed so lazily put together and deprived of care I'd rather invite you over to my place so I could make you one instead. Note: Tiny diced up pieces of cucumbers and mushy red apples will happily sink to the bottom of a glass and serve no purpose ever.   As in: I could make out through the noisy atmosphere (place was packed what you do you expect) that Kelela and The Internet were blasting on the speakers. But when I excitedly waved  our waitress over so to find out who to thank for the excellent musical selection, she informed me it was just some Songza playlist someone put on...   Ok fine, that last one only bothers my crushed heart.   I still recommend it. It was packed on a Tuesday night in January, and there was a pizza on almost any table I could peek at from my seat. People like it. But man is there no excuse to serve a sad Pimm's ever."}
{"text":"Working in the suburbs and the general nature of my actual profession limits my opportunities for a nice weekday lunch downtown. So many great options to enjoy if you have the chance. Last month, I had a random Friday off to enjoy downtown. Perfect chance to go out to lunch with my mother who works in town and have a nice lunch. Given the location of her work, I figured that Cafe Parvis would be worthwhile to try.  Located on Mayor street, just a quick walk over from Place des Spectacles, Cafe Parvis is from the same people who run Bar Furco just next door. Similar to its sister, Cafe Parvis certainly has a look to it. An interesting mixture of exposed concrete, brick and wood creates a very lived-in feel. The use of vines and plants all over the interior plus the huge windows create a warmth and relaxed atmosphere. Too bad it was a little too cool to enjoy the terrasse in the front.  Foodwise, Cafe Parvis is all about pizza and salads. My mother went for one of the salad. Beets, pears, arugula, noix de grenoble, goat cheese and a tarragon dressing. A very hearty portion - tons of ingredients and very flavourful. Nice mixture with the beets, the sweet pears, the rich goat cheese and that awesome tarragon dressing. My mother had just the salad and was quite full.  The pizzas are served by the slice. Similar approach as the salad - tons of ingredients and high on flavour. The key thing though is that crust. If that doesn't hold up, it doesn't matter. Thankfully, the crust here was on point. Closer to the \"Al Taglio\" style, the crust was thick with a nice crunch but still chewy. First up, I had the lamb, feta and tzatziki pizza. Great flavour to the lamb and with a big dollop of tzatziki right on top. Excellent.  Next was ricotta with spinach and roasted peppers. Great mixture of creamy rich ricotta and sweet peppers. Served almost as a sandwich means you get double the crunch compared to the other slices.  The final pizza I tried was the duck confit with potatoes, cheddar, garlic oil and rosemary. Very flavourful once again. Loved the fatty duck and how it mixed with the potato and the cheese. However, with the amount of potato on the pizza, it made the pizza much dryer since there is no sauce to speak of. I would have needed more cheese to offset.  Thankfully we got there just before noon because there was a lineup by the time we left. I understand why - excellent pizza, flavourful salads and a beautiful space to sit in as people seek a break from their workdays. Cafe Parvis certainly lived up to my hopes and made a beautiful Friday off that much more enjoyable. Anyone working nearby should certainly give it a look.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for lunch or a casual afternoon meeting. The food is decent, the coffee is good, but the highlight for me is the venue, the location, and the atmosphere. It's got this awesome \"chic refurbished\" look that I love. I'd describe the location as follows: downtown but in a spot that can be described as the \"nook of downtown\". Recommend."}
{"text":"I have an annoyingly sensitive nose for freshness and i would have to say that this is one of the only spots in Montreal that never disappointed me on how fresh their ingredients are!. I want to steal their tomatoes from the kitchen and i want to learn all their secrets for crafting beautiful, healthy and delicious salads! The coffee is always good and as I was sitting at the bar the other day, i also saw some great efforts on their cocktail making! It's like a fresh oasis downtown away from all the business lunch places / foodcourts / chains.  ps: make a reservation for brunch/dinner as everyone is doing the same, you don't actually have much space when you do walk-ins."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a late afternoon meal at the bar. The pizza and beet salad we had were delicious. service was just ok. The place is really beautiful though and I think I would prefer sitting at a table for breakfast."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch spot! The atmosphere of the restaurant is so cool, and the dishes are delicious. I tried the confit squid for brunch on my last visit, and it was unexpectedly light and flavorful - I'd definitely recommend it. The service is great too, I like how they don't rush you out of your table, even when it's busy."}
{"text":"Haven't seen a restaurant that is so earthy and rusty at same time. Beauty in decay!   Came here on Saturday with my gangs from NYC, what we ordered the most is the fresh chilly Carrot and Orange Juice! It was wow, why are you so hydrating, delicious and make me even more thirsty. Simple ingredient but very tasteful.   The beet cheese salad, the thin crust breakfast pizza and the thick cut bacon with Pastry and egg on top are all delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now to study. If your goal is to do work, arrive well before or after the very busy lunch hour to make sure you get a table. Parvis is a beautiful venue to meet with friends or crank some work out.   The coffee is excellent and I've sampled two different pizzas, both of which were delish.  In my opinion this is one of the best Cafe options available in the downtown core."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing! The coffee is great and their breakfast pizza is one of the best I've ever tried. If you come here for breakfast/lunch, do yourself a favor and order the pizzas. You can thank me later."}
