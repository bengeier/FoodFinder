{"text":"Food was good, but waited for 45 mins and when the food arrived, it wasn't hot.  The cueso dip was actually cold and had the cold cheese film on top of it. Service was also slack.."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! My buddies and I came up this Sunday. The wings were great and the beer was cold. I never had to track down my server and she was super fun. Damn good day."}
{"text":"Not great, but not terrible either. We'd heard good things from a friend, and went in pretty optimistic. The restaurant itself is typical sports bar- lots of tvs, full bar, etc.  But, after receiving our menus we were disappointed to discover the first 2 things we tried to order were not available. They stopped serving curly fries (but hadn't updated their menu), and were somehow out of the appetizer we wanted. Blah! The wings my husband ordered were ok, but unremarkable. I got their gyro sandwich for something different, and it was pretty good.  Overall I left the place with mixed feelings. I may go back and give them another shot, but I'm not in any hurry to eat there again."}
{"text":"used to have good wings in the past; however, last couple of times--ordered the thai wings--really dry and tasteless (seemed refried and had no meat or sauce on them); since then, have been avoiding this place; lots of better places for wings."}
{"text":"I ordered/picked up some take out last Thursday on my way home from work.  I called ahead and placed an order for two different types of wings and a salad.  I was a little hesitant given the reviews I read but I had great service.  When I arrived the hostess came over with my order and without asking she went through each item opening and showing me it was exactly as I ordered.  Her register was locked - it was 5pm on a Thursday so not too surprising - so I had to go over to the bar to pay, not a big deal.  The bartender was busy but she got to me as soon as she finished with the person she was closing out.  I'd definitely go back, the salad was great, as were the wings.  Personally I like their spicy teriyaki wings the best.  It was my only time there but I found the staff very pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"I was with a party of 5 at this place today. I can deal with bad and/or busy service, but this was by FAR the WORST service I have ever ever gotten in my entire life. I am absolutely appalled at how blatantly rude our server was and how poorly we were treated.  We had friends visiting from out of state. We have been at wings and rings before on a late Sunday night. It was dead, waitress very friendly and attentive and food was good. So we decided it would be a great to catch Sunday football before they drove 10 hrs back home.  Fast forward to today..... Sooo many things went wrong it was almost unbelievable. Our server took our orders and brought out drinks. We had all ordered appetizers and entrees.   About 40 mins passes, and we had received nothing. We finally flag down our waiter to ask on the status (everyone else around us that had came in after us received their food already) and he gave us some generic answer about it being really busy and we were still third in line to have our food made?  About two mins later, a different waitress comes with one of the appetizers (which was cold, which means it was sitting there waiting to br brought out) and asks us if our waiter had let us know that there was no more garlic aioli for one of our appetizers. He had not. Also brought out was one person's entree.   So at this point after almost an hour, we have one cold appetizer, one appetizer missing, one unable to be made, and one person's entree (which also was a burger and the waiter had never asked how she wanted it cooked- it was way overdone).  30 mins after this .. Still no entrees, and a missing appetizer. People around us who arrived after us have eaten and are leaving.  We finally request a manager and We are told he is too busy in the kitchen and will be our to talk to us st his convenience... Really??????  Finally, our entrees come. Food was ok but at this point it doesn't even matter.  At this point our server had pretty given up on our table. We were not being nasty in any way whatsoever, either, to deserve this treatment. He started to blatantly ignore us and then brought the check without even us asking for it.  Not once did he check in on us, ask us if we needed anything else, ask us how the food was.  Finally the manager comes out and tries to make excuses for the food being late, etc. Really, the food taking longer than usual is understandable for this place on a busy NFL Sunday. But, 1. They should really be better prepared for a bigger crowd on Sundays and 2. The real problem was with our server and his attitude! He offered us beers on the house, but really didn't seem to care too much.  It was almost as if we did something obscene to deserve this terrible treatment. When in reality, we did nothing. I will never, ever, go back to this place again and I would recommend that no one else go either. You will seriously regret it if you get stuck with this service. Its a shame because the food can be pretty good."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here and the wings were awesome! However, my husband wanted them extra wet, but we won't be doing that next time. I think more of the flavoring will be greatly appreciated if it is not extra wet because the sauce was liquid texture and more oily. But overall, it was good and I would definitely go back again.  The lady that took my order was friendly and greeted me by my name when I walked in the door (it was a slow day)."}
{"text":"We thought we would re-try this restaurant.  We had been here before and were appalled by the terrible service, but last night was even worse!  Our food came to the table and we had no plates or utensils to eat it.  The waiter finally brought those over after we asked for them!  Then our waiter sat down at a bar table with other customers.  We had to get his attention to get a refill on our drinks and more ranch dressing.   After bringing these to our table, he sat down with same customers.  When we got his attention again, we asked for the check.  He brought it, and then sat back down again at the table with customers.  We waited and waited.  I took my card out and put it on the outside of the payment book so he could see it.  After 5 minutes, as he is still sitting and talking to the same customers, we went to the front with our check.  The girl told us that she could not ring us up, and she called the server and he came to do it.  This restaurant should close!  I will not be back!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this was one of the worst dining experiences of my life, and I eat out a lot. Our table sat there for literally almost 1.5 hours before our food finally arrived. When it did it was cold and over half of the orders at our table were incorrect. The Manager did not come over until the end of the meal, and I could tell by his cocky strut and smirk that he could really care less if we were happy or not. Of course much as I predicted he made no offerings of meal comps or even a free desert. He only made somewhat of an apologetic gesture but it did not seem in any way sincere. This place is run by kids, I know it is a bar but there needs to be some level of Management there that knows how to run a restaurant. I would be surprised if this place is open another 6 months under their current Management. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Keeping it short because numerous people have said it in greater detail. The food is of the lowest quality. The service was slow and unfriendly. It's too bad because it's an excellent space in a great location. Pretty decent beer list. Would not go back."}
{"text":"First time there, and thought it was an average experience.  I met a group of girlfriends for a our girls nite out and had a good time.  I gotta admit, the wings were good, but the service wasn't.  My friend had a chicken salad and had maybe 3 little slices of chicken on a bed of chopped iceburg lettuce mix.  What intrigued me was that a people started to pour in for the poker tables.  Not sure what the cover charge was for that but would would like to learn for the fun of it.  Overall rating is A-OK, casual restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill over the past few years.   I used to come here all the time but now only do occasional carry out.  Food quality and size of portions gets worse every time I eat here.  My order frequently gets screwed up.  The wait staff seem to get younger and dumber.   If you just want to order beers and watch football, you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Went to dinner on a Tuesday night, was greeted and seated right away. Our waiter was slow and acted like he was slammed all night even though he only had a few tables to oversee. Our food took a long time to come out. Wings are good here but do not get the kid's dyno bites. They were bland-no taste. One of our sides was written down wrong by the waiter. Refills on our drinks took several minutes."}
{"text":"Truly awful. Bad food, huge prices.  App was \"oversized stuffed tater tots \" they were still frozen in the middle sent them back. When they returned they would have been good if I didn't have the memory of frozen hash brown in my mouth. BTW no one apologized..  \"Boneless wings\" were simply tenders cut in thirds and incinerated (yes I mean over cooked to a point you would have trouble understanding).  They charge $6.50 for goose island ipa.. that is almost as disgusting as the food.  The fact that this place has been around as long as it has is destroying my faith in my neighborhood. Avoid this place... they are bad at everything restaurant"}
{"text":"My husband and I live in the same neighborhood so we often like to get something to go when we're in a hurry however, we wont be going again anytime soon. Every time we have ordered food to go its wrong. The last time we went, several items were missing from our order. When I went back I was told by the  manager that everyone is asked to sign their receipt confirming everything is correct. I told her that in the 6 months months we've lived in the neighborhood and been eating there, we have never signed a receipt. At this point the manager argued with me, stating this was their policy. When I asked her to show me the receipt we had signed, she could not produce it. It's very frustrating to order food, have it be wrong and then have someone tell you its your fault. Not only this but I believe the hostess or the kitchen staff should be reviewing the orders and signing the receipt, not the customer. I'm paying for the food, the staff should be the one guaranteeing the order is correct. It's too frustrating dealing with the staff and always having your order be wring, we will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Thought I'd write a review based on what was recently posted on their Facebook page about Yelp fake reviewers.  It really shows the maturity level of the staff when they are crying out about their negative reviews on social media.  Myself, I haven't been back to Wings and Rings since the NFL Season ended.  The only reason I decided to return was because of a local bar down the road has closed.  Now let's get to the point, the service is absolutely horrendous.  No matter where you sit, inside or outside the service is terrible, except sitting at the bar.  Drinks are refilled whenever the server feels like checking up on you.  Bring cash when paying for the check, you might be waiting all night for your bill.   Food - Delicious, wings and burgers are great."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how this place is staying open.  The wings are so-so.  I'd heard gummy and limp and that's dead on.  My guess is they toss them from freezer to fryer.  Flavorings (we had several) are ok but nothing special.  Atmosphere is great.  Lots of big, clear HD TVs showing sports.  Fun environment.  Service was OK but nothing special.  Our waittress had difficulty understanding what we wanted for our order (a slight change from the menu).  When she finally understood what we were asking (pretty simple) she told us it wasn't possible.  It was the kind of change I'd expect any restaurant to make without any trouble or at least with a small upcharge for their inconvenience.  Apparently they won't consider it or maybe she didn't want to go to the trouble of asking.  Food came quickly.  Our bill came in a timely manner.  When we arrived (6pm) the place was empty.  When we left around 7pm it was about 20% full.  I guess they make their money on alcohol sales during big games.  Not sure.  Anyway, I would not bother returning.  I'd rather go to 1/2 dozen other places.  Check out Hickory Tavern, Fox and Hound, Flip'n Chicken, or Baileys for much better food.  All but Flip'n Chicken have tons of sports TVs going.  Flip'n Chicken has the best wings."}
{"text":"Don't come here.  The drinks are watered down and over priced.  I ordered a Dewers White Label neat, it was $6.50.  I ordered it with ice, it was $9.50.  There is no more liquor in their rocks drink than there is in a neat drink.  Total bullshit."}
{"text":"Never coming back.  I've been here twice before but after today I won't be back. The booth they seated us at for lunch was dirty. The service was slow but most of all there were two dead flies on the inside of the window.  When I pointed this out to Gia that the window needed cleaning, she said \"oh yeah\".  I'm. Done."}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  Ordered an appetizer as meal, granddaughter ordered wings. Appetizer came out in 25 mins, wings came out in 45 mins.  No silverware on table.  Never asked if we wanted refills.  Restaurant was not busy.  Person at the reception desk was on her phone and taking selfies."}
{"text":"This is a great local bar / restaurant!  The wings are amazing (larger than any competition, crispy, with better sauce), and I also am a big fan of their Gyros.  The owners are awesome, always checking in to see how things are, and the bartenders are great.  It doesn't take long for the bartenders to know you and know what you like, and without making it a 'habit', you still feel like a regular.  Talk to Bob or Robin or any of the bartenders and they're more than happy to chat while pouring your favorite drink.  It's a place that feels comfy, and I always leave happy.  Of course I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Imagine stale and tasteless chicken tenders you might get at a school cafeteria... and then lower it five more notches and you may  get a sense of how awful our take out wings were tonight. Garlic Parmesan and Teryaki that tasted like card board. So  disappointed. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My in-laws live near by and like to go to this place every once in a while (MIL likes the Long Islands!) so we met up with them and another family member last night at Buffalo Wings & Rings.  They seated us in a weird spot, really far from all of the other customers which wouldn't be an issue except they kind of forgot we were there. There seemed to be at least three servers on the patio but the service was extremely slow and it was as if our waitress forgot we were there. She spent about fifteen minutes talking to people at another table while we were waiting for drinks and the other half of our order. We never got water, and when my husband asked for a side of ranch she brought it but told us her manager said we'd have to pay fifty cents for it. I don't mean to nit pick... Obviously if we were eating out, fifty cents wasn't really an issue since we were paying for a whole meal but it was so off the wall and ridiculous, that we just said forget it. I always am baffled when businesses \"nickel and dime\" their customers so they end up feeling so ripped off or peeved that the service and food were forgotten.   Oh yeah, the food. I wish we could forget it. I had the \"gyro\" which was a pita with about a teaspoon of chopped tomatoes, weird \"mystery meat\" and that is it. I had fries as my side and asked for ketchup, which was free... so that is a plus, I guess. We passed around some wings but since there were no napkins they weren't really eaten.  My husband's burger made him nauseous and the fried pickles we ordered for the table were way over-salted and we think some other things must have slipped into the fryer (we guessed a jalapeño and a stray pepperoni? I hope that was it.)   I hate to be a debbie downer, but this place might consider a total re-haul of management, menu items, and ... yeah. Good luck. I know everyone can have a bad day, I worked in restaurants for years, so I'm sorry if this was just a freak bad day, but this was just awful.   Bottom line: We wish this place was better but it was just so very atrocious. Don't go. Sorry."}
{"text":"Came in because I had been craving wings for over a week and after being unable to find the other places I looked up, I am severely directionally challenged and am pretty sure Siri hates me, I stumbled upon tis place. It was pretty slow for a play off Sunday but I was just getting a to go order anyway so the wait was no big deal. I ordered a 15 piece wing. The hostess said it came with celery and a dip, I prefer carrots with my wings but whatever. I waited the 10 minutes and left. When I got home I was dying to open the box, I had gotten a few finger licks in the car. The wings were HUGE but I was missing one, not a big deal since they are so big, and the celery and dip. Since I didn't really want them anyway it's not that big of a deal but they would have been a perfect pallet cleanser between wings. Overall this place is great. Would definitely come back to eat in the dining room."}
{"text":"By far, best wings we've had.  Used to be a fan of one of competitors, no longer.  Once this place opened, we got hooked.  Great variety of sauces, my fav is Crazy, friend's is Cajun.  I like my wings crispy and that's how they're done.  Each night of during the week, they have specials.  The one I remember best is on Tuesday cuz it's 49 cent wing night.  Yeah!  The quesadillas are good too.  If I remember right they come in two sizes and three or four varieties.      Have tried a couple of sides, cajun curly fries with side of melted cheese for dipping and their onion rings.  They have something call Sloppy Fries, loaded with all kinds of stuff, which looks and sounds like a meal in itself.  Haven't tried yet, but whenever we see them come out, boy they look and smell good.  Owners are really nice too.  They're always walking around and checking in on patrons to make sure everything is ok.  Very friendly folks.    There are several TVs mounted so you can catch the games, throw back a few brews and munch away.  Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of TV's and a good beer selection. The food is not very good; but the atmosphere is great to watch a sporting event."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss you can get great wings there are not so great wings.  The parking there is terrible.  I haven't had much there besides the wings but what else would you order at wing place?"}
{"text":"Have eaten here about 4-5 times already and always try a new entree, but always leaving hoping for more.., This location is within walking distance from my house which makes it ideal, but this place is only good for drinks and appetizers (however the mixed drinks are about $7.50-$8.50).  Entrees seem to be either too soggy or too dry (sandwiches/quesadillas).  The aioli fries weren't very fresh either. Overall never had a great experience in the five times I've been there. Always mediocre food. But lots of TVs.."}
{"text":"Living in this area it's great to find non chain restaurants so we stopped in for lunch one day. Not bad and not good. I got the chicken pita with fries. Food is under seasoned and just doesn't look that great. Server was quick and friendly. Don't come here for a meal, maybe just stop on for a drink and some wings late at night."}
{"text":"I live in this area and really wanted some buffalo chicken.  The place was completely dead at lunch time which is normally a huge red flag but I have to say my experience was fine.   I was seated immediately and served my beverage pretty fast.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and was fresh and delicious.  I ordered the Buffalo chicken wrap without the tomatoes and Bleu cheese that comes standard.  They actually got that right! You don't know how rare that is for me!   Don't know what the problems were in the past but it appears they are working to address it. I'll come back!"}
{"text":"Nice chill place to watch the game and grab a beer. Good drink specials and apps too."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST wings in the area!! The spicy Thai chili is seriously the best sauce I've ever had on wings, they should sell it by the bottle!   The rest of the menu is decent and standard bar food. The wings, by far, is what you should order!   I'm not sure how I can convince you to try the spicy Thai chili sauce but you have to... Even if you just order it as a side and dip your fries into them!"}
{"text":"My kids and I really enjoyed this family friendly sports bar...you get what you'd expect...mid priced bar food...and it's good.  I'd prefer a more diverse beer selection (all domestic, no variety) but otherwise we left pleased..will visit again!"}
{"text":"I just moved to charlotte and tried this for lunch today. I ordered a Gyro sandwich and some wings. The wings were fairly run of the mill. The sauce was mostly bland. My Gyro didn't have a hint of cucumber and the meat was clearly processed. I'm guessing it was microwaved. I'm afraid the food simply wasn't very good. In the bright side the wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, it won't be enough to bring me back. Best of luck Buffalo Wings and Rings."}
{"text":"Went here with a group on friends on Saturday night and though the service was good, the food, not so much. So at the table we had the buffalo cauliflower, chicken wings, parmesan fries, fried pickles, French fries, onion rings and salad. Matt our server was very nice but I think he was new.  I was trying to get something veganized and I think there was some confusion on his part.  He told us the garlic and parmesan were mixed together so there was no way I could get just garlic fries but when my friends order came out, it was garlic aioli with thick slice of somewhat melted cheese over it though it was supposed to be shaved parmesan. And she was convinced that it wasn't parmesan cheese at all. There's a picture I included.  Now, if these are the garlic parmesan fries others are boasting about, I'm confused.  Everyone who ordered wings were pleased with them and the regular fries were good so I'd say, if you just want wings and fries it's a go.    Here's my thoughts on the rest: Cauliflower Buffalo \"wings\"  DO NOT SPEND $6.99 on this baby sized portion and very soggy dish. I took a pic of that as well. It came in a bowl and just covered the bottom of it and looked like scraps of leftover cauliflower pieces. Now you can get a whole head of cauliflower for under 2 bucks at the grocery store and this portion is probably 1/5 of a head of cauliflower. If you go to Bean Vegan Cuisine's yelp page and check out their version of this same dish, which is where I had it for the first time, you'll see just how pathetic theirs is. Seriously, look at the picture I posted. I hadn't eaten any of it and that was the portion size. Fried Pickles:  Too Salty, couldn't finish them. Onion Rings:  Yummy. Perfectly crunchy and nice size. French Fries:  Delicious and hot! Garlic Parmesan Fries:  Came on this tiny plate and my friend said it looked like she ordered cheese with a few fries hidden under them. Picture of that as well. They couldn't finish them.  My thought was, who in the kitchen would be okay sending out this cauliflower and parmesan fries? Like, really?  Now, would I go back?  Most likely, just because it's so close to my house and if like on Saturday, we make a last minute to decision to grab a bite and don't want to stray far from home, I'll go.  I would make sure everyone sticks to fries, onion rings and wings and leave everything else alone.  It's a great place to hang out and watch the game because it is spacious and has lots of television's.  Only thing I didn't like was the TV's showing the MMA fighters beating each other to a pulp. Yikes, can we just have one channel non sports, maybe The Travel channel, Food Network, maybe?  Just asking. LOL!   That is all! (Don't forget to hit the useful, funny or cool button.  Would love the feedback.)"}
{"text":"I ate there at lunch time with a friend and I have to say its the worst food i have had in very long time i had 5 wings and onion rings and a sweet tea and my friend had 5 wings and fries .. my food was luke warm and the service was horrible i paid $ 5 for 2 sweet teas and was never even offered a refill ... they did take off 1 meal ... I will not be returning there is nothing special about this place very disappointed this place doesn't even deserve a star"}
{"text":"Awful service. I will tell everyone I know that the wings may be good, but the people who answer the phone and take care of to go orders are awful at their job. I will spread the word to avoid dealing with them over the phone at all possible. This review is based on the woman who answered the phone on 07/24/17 at around 8pm."}
{"text":"Hair in our burger, wings not as good as it use to be. Something has changed. Nachos are a smaller portion."}
{"text":"Second time and this place continues to impress!  The flavors, quality and service are spot on!  Our go-to favorites are Peach Habanero, Sweet BBQ, Garlic Parm Fries,  and Onion Rings.  Boneless breading is amazing not too much...just right. Give this place a chance....you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We live so close to this place, but had avoided it up until now based on the Yelp ratings/review I read.  A couple of us wanted to watch the football game at a sports bar, so we decided to give it a try.  Their beer list is pretty good - they have a wide selection of beer.  Our waitress seemed very confused when we asked about any beer specials they had.  She didn't really answer the question, but said a few beers were $3, so a few of us ordered whatever the special was.  We also placed an order for food - nachos & wings.    The food took FOREVER to come out.  We had to ask our waitress why it was taking so long which was met with more confusion and an excuse of the place was full so they were overwhelmed...  When the food finally came out, it was good at least.  The nachos were decent, but the wings were really good.  We got the garlic parm & rajun cajun flavors.  We ordered more beer and she messed up the order for everyone's drink order and asked if we wanted to have what she brought out anyway.   The service was definitely interesting, but the food and the location was good so I will give this place another shot.  Hopefully she was just having an off day and isn't normally that out of it."}
{"text":"Awful. The beer was the only thing that was good. The service sucked and the food was eh ok. It took 25 mins to get my food. When I got my food, they got it wrong. I had to wait another 25 minutes for them to get it right. The manager only gave us a $5.00 coupon. Come on, they could have at least took off my dinner. RIDICULOUS!"}
{"text":"It was okay - could be better, but I have had worse. It was extremely crowded on a Sat. night, and there were 2 big (somewhat local) college football games being broadcast: Clemson vs. Ga Tech, and USC Gamecocks vs. Tn.Titans. These 2 colleges have quite a big following in this area, and that may have been why so crowded - I'm not sure. At any rate, after we waited about 10 mins to be seated, the waitress was quick to get our drinks and appetizer (onion rings) order. They were delivered rather quickly by a food runner while the waitress happened to be standing by our table, but... they didn't have the sauce. When the waitress came back by, I asked her about it to which she said they didn't come with sauce. I pointed out that according to the menu they do and she got us the sauce. I had 5 \"X-Hot\" wings - Buffalo style which were VERY good. They were hot enough but not so hot that I couldn't enjoy them. I also ordered 5 \"Hot\" Garlic-Parmesan wings. NOT my favorite AT all; I don't care for them. I ordered their Blue Cheese dressing (with my celery) and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD good!  Things were fine til I visited the bathroom. When you look up, you can see a layer of dust on top of the rustic wooden stalls. Also, the toilet tank needed to be cleaned, which to me, indicates a lack of deep everyday cleaning. It took a while to get our bill, even after our waitress had removed our empty dishes and such. I finally had to ask her, but due to this being a sports bar environment, she may have thought that we were wanting to spend more time watching the games. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt on that one, afterall, she was very nice and for such a busy night, quite attentive - EXCEPT when I had to ask for my water refill. Unfortunately, ALL servers everywhere NEVER seem to want to refill water! I don't drink sodas, and would have had an unsweetened iced tea had it not been so late at night. Not everyone that orders water with meals is doing so just to \"be cheap!\""}
{"text":"We've eaten here numerous times and the food is pretty good.  Had a bad experience a week ago. It was 11:15ish on a Friday night and my son and I went there after a checkers game.  We were told the kitchen closed at 11pm and the bar closes at midnight.  I looked up the hours before we drove a ways and there's nothing written about the kitchen closing early.  Was told matter of factly with no empathy or sympathy from woman at the front.  We will take our business elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Not sure what kind of service every other reviewer is having here, but I've never been disappointed here (and frequent the restaurant almost once a week since its reopening).   Service - I typically sit in the high-tops at the bar. Service is always super fast. Even on Sundays when the Panthers are playing, it never takes more than 3 minutes to get a beer and food is usually delivered within 10 minutes of ordering. The girls all have a sense of urgency about their business.  Food - OH MAN the food!! I've had the pulled pork nachos which are amazing. Their hot wings are just about the best I've ever had. All the wing sauces I've tried were great expect for the wasabi (which I didn't think I would like anyway -- just not my thing). The appetizer sampler was good. The only thing I've had here that was mediocre was the potato skins, which I was stupid for getting anyway.   Bar/Patrons/Entertainment - I've never been bored here. They have live music on Fridays at dinnertime, a ton of TVs which they label on Sunday for football so you can grab the right table, and friendly patrons in the bar.   Beer - the beer selection is great considering the number of taps they have. They also have a good selection of seasonal/bottled beer.  Give this place a try! Remember that it's a sports bar that specializes in wings and beer, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I didn't give more stars solely based on the service. I live across the street, have been here dozens of times and I've never had good service. Ever. My beer often goes bone dry before it's acknowledged and I'll then have to seek service. I cannot complain about the food; it's always tasty and very, very good If you are in a rush, refrain from going but for a night out watching MMA (PPV fights are free) or a Saturday/Sunday football game, this is a great spot!  I suggest the wings; they are very good.  Want better ones?  Go to Kristopher's in Matthews!"}
{"text":"Went here most recently for a weekday lunch, but have been here about five times for either lunch or dinner. We ate lunch outside two days ago and were swarmed by flying ants; not cool. Bring your bug spray!  Overall, the place has lots of TVs and has a sports bar feel; nice. The buffalo chicken wrap is good."}
{"text":"Wow, sorry to continue this negative trend but I have nothing good to say about my experience. The restaurant was dead on a Monday evening and the food was not hot. Not sure why as it was all fried and should have come out hot and fresh. After reading all these other posts, I think someone in charge should really take a close look at their business, many dollars were spent to open this place, hate to see them close."}
{"text":"We made a stop here after seeing \"Shutter Island\".  Great movie, not a great experience here.  When we walked in and sat at a table in the bar we were promptly greeted by the bartender and placed our order.  She returned quickly with our pitcher of beer ($8.00).  The music was playing and the atmosphere was nice.  Not to loud to talk and sports on the big screen.  I figured this might be a nice place to hang out.    Well, it went down hill from there.  My lovely wife decided that we should split a sampler platter so we did.  Our food came out within about 10 minutes.  The \"platter\" was a small basket containing the following: 3 onion rings, 3 mozzarella sticks, 3 potato skins and 3 stuffed peppers.  The quality was on the order of the freezer section at frys......    The price on this was $11.99!   Now, I could be a little more understanding if it was $5.99.....  So....   We ate and worked on drinking our pitcher as it started to rain.  I then made a visit to the bathroom which was filthy and without paper towels.   I returned to my seat in the bar and watched the platinum blond, that appears to be known by most of the customers, as she tried to find someone that might be willing to take her home for the night.    I guess my opinion would be that this place is not worth a return visit.    I am certain that we can find a better place to spend our money in the future!"}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for the past few years but I've never stopped at this place before, the food was great and the service was excellent, I would definitely recommend it to watch the game while eating a good meal.....especially come for the 69 cent wings on Tuesday nights."}
{"text":"So my experience with the place is only at lunch and they have a good deal for lunch, since the restaurant is relatively empty during that time.  They also accept the Ballantyne card, so you can get a discount on top, making for a real cheap lunch.  The wings are generally pretty good, after you figure out what sauce and heat you want in them.  I haven't tried much of the other items on the menu, so I can't speak for those.  There are a lot of TVs and the bar is stocked with a lot of beers.  Service though is probably where they are weakest at; I have waited to be seated for over five minutes in an mostly empty restaurant... which is lame.  Also the server will occasionally visit, so you need to hit her quick if you want to pay that bill right away otherwise you wait more.  Overall, good deal on food but service good be better."}
{"text":"I want to like this place so bad!!! It is right by my house and similar to a Buffalo Wild Wings (which I love). Unfortunately, the food is ok, but the service is untrained.  The cool part about this place is they offer multiple sauces and you can choose your heat. If this worked, it would be awesome. However, it seems they add some type of vinegar sauce to add heat. I think the cook does this when ordered as the heat is very inconsistent from one order to the next and it appears they just squeeze the sauce in but don't mix it resulting in some bites very hot and some not.  After being unimpressed with the wings, I have switched to a chicken wrap with the sauce on the wrap. A very simple order, but I have ordered it six times now and they have not gotten it right once (first four times, they did not add the sauce and last two times the sauce was the regular with no heat).  When it is right, I really enjoy this, but way too much effort. I hate having to send my food back to get it right (don't ever do it anywhere else, but have to do it everytime here).  In summary, great idea, horrible execution."}
{"text":"I went here for a late lunch today and was not very pleased when I left.  The food was pretty good - the onion rings I had as an appetizer were really quite good.  My main gripe was the service - terrible is the best way I can describe it!  Our drinks were never refilled by our waitress, we had to ask another waitress for them, and when it came time for our check, the entire paying process took over 15 minutes.  I could understand if the restaurant were swamped, but we were one of maybe 10 tables in the entire restaurant.  It may have just been bad luck as to who we had for service, but it really dampened my overall experience."}
{"text":"This was not the location I visited yet I can't seem to find the NEW and \"IMPROVED\" Buffalo Wings and Rings on Yelp.  The location I stupidly decided to go to last night was the one attached to the Fiesta Mall in Mesa.  It's new.  And it's fucking gross.   On our way home from work I told the boyfriend we should check out somewhere new for happy hour simply because I needed a new Yelp review to write.  He was reluctant to try this shit hole, pressuring me to simply enjoy a few beers at Casey Moore's instead of wanting something \"new.\"  \"But I need to yelp.\"  Walking into Buffalo Wings and Rings is sad and disappointing and you already know it's going to suck.  There was no one in the place and the decor consists of sports jersey's thumb tacked to a wall and three or four dated flat screen TV's showing a bunch of bullshit no one is watching.  'Cause no one is there.   We're greeted by a faux punk rock chick with a horrible fire engine red dye job which was unflattering for that A-Line haircut she paid too much for at Tony and Guy.  She was obviously new to the whole \"serving\" thing which is probably why she was working on a Wednesday night when everyone was watching the premier of American Idol.  We asked if we could sit outside as the inside was dreary and unwelcoming, like my Grandpa's house on Christmas.   Buffalo Wings and Rings has the ugliest and most uncomfortable plastic, grade school-esque chairs I've ever seen.  The tables are also ugly, plastic, wobbly and adorned with tree droppings and uncleaned ashtrays.    The boyfriend gives me an \"I told you so\" look as we move around trying to find a clean table and one in which we're not getting hit with hot air by some weird, loud buzzing fan.  We finally settle at a sticky table with an uncleaned, smelly ashtray.   I ask Faux Punk Server about their specials; 2.50 domestic pints, nothing good on draft, no food specials, no well specials.  I order a Michelob Ultra as I have little other choice.  We wait too long.  Faux Punk Server comes back, \"Oh, keg is empty, have to refill, can you wait?\"    We wait longer, we get our beers.  We look at the shitty, over priced Buffalo Wild Wings rip off of a menu.  I hate the whole \"pick your flavor, then pick your heat\" thing they do at some wing places.  It seems odd and, um, retarded.  I order five sweet and sour with the \"atomic\" sauce, the boyfriend get original buffalo \"extra hot.\"  I feel it necessary to mention that when we got our wings they all tasted exactly the same.  A thin layer of Frank's Red Hot on gross, old, frozen wings served in plastic bowls.  At one point I spit a piece out because it tasted like ground beef.    We also had the pleasure of their \"signature item,\" Sloppy Fries.  These were frozen french fries served, again, in a giant plastic bowl covered with canned chili and fake nacho cheese.  It literally looked like a bowl of vomit.  Like, someone ate a bunch of McDonald's hamburgers and fries and then threw it up in a bowl and set it down on the table for us.  We ended up having this wrapped up so I could give it to my dog.  He liked it a lot.  But as the boyfriend later pointed out, \"he also licks his asshole a lot.\"    Ironically, Faux Punk Server said as she sat them down, \"these look SO good.\"  As it turned out, nothing here was good or redeeming.  Even the server, though she tried her best, fumbled over her words, nervously took our plates and couldn't make eye contact.  The entire place reeked of low-ball, less than nothing American shit food and the emptiness of the dining area soon become the emptiness of my FUCKING SOUL as I dished out thirty bucks to spit shit out and bitch for an hour.   As we left the place I told the boyfriend he was right, we should have just gone to Casey Moore's and not given into my now costly desire to try something new for a stupid Yelp review.  I love you, Yelp, but this time your existence has failed me."}
{"text":"Regular sports bar setting....tv's everywhere. It is definitely kid friendly."}
{"text":"Horrible! Arrived to an empty restaurant, counted 3 wait staff. Took about 15 minutes for server to greet and take our drink orders. 1 member of our parties food came out almost immediately. 45 minutes later no food for the rest of us. We addressed the issue with the manager and she threw her server under the bus by saying that the server was new and only worked there for 3 days. If you knew that she was new and over whelmed then why wasn't someone helping her? Manager gave us food at no charge but we threw it away. It was cold and tasted horrible. Never again!"}
{"text":"The wings aren't bad, I think they're crispy and flavorful and I've had friends who love their wings and some who don't. The atmosphere seems a bit weird at times, sometimes when I arrive the restaurant will be empty but it'll take around 15 minutes for a server to notice my party at the door and afterwards the service could be better.   On another note, I've seen people from my high school, that I know are underage, being served alcohol at the bar. Found that to be a bit weird. You'd think people would be more careful since regulations can be so serious.   There's far worse places, but I think management is either lacking or non-existent."}
{"text":"Beer batter haddock really good. Friendly staff. Great wings. This second time here bring the family. It's kid friendly."}
{"text":"Don't know if you can rate 0 stars but that's what it deserves.  Went as a party of 6. They got one of my friends order wrong, brought a wrap vs a salad.  Brought my buddy 10 wings, 9 of which were flaps.  After bringing this to the servers attention, she said it's just random.  Manager came over and basically said tough luck.  Too many restaurants in the area for poor management."}
{"text":"HIRE NEW MANAGEMENT or expect to close soon.  Now that that is out of the way.. I've been there a few times, mainly because of the proximity to our house/work, also because of the coupons which came in the Citypass book.  This most recent time was the worst and was, without a doubt, the last time I will ever go to this or any other location for this franchise.  There were 4 of us there at lunch time (12:45pm-1pm or so) on a Thursday. We were literally one of 3 tables there. One table was already eating and the other table was waiting for their food. The 4 of us ordered and it took around 30 minutes for our food to come. Completely unreasonable, considering we were literally 1 of 2 tables waiting for food in the entire restaurant. When the food did come, the fries were lukewarm at best, so we sent them back. It took nearly 10 minutes for the new fries to come... My girlfriend ate her entire sandwich while we were waiting for her fries to come back.  At this point, we were pretty frustrated so I asked to speak to the manager. The manager, a blond lady named Christine came over. I explained the situation to her (pretty much as I did above). She said that she was in the kitchen and she saw the tickets come back so she knows that it didn't take 10 minutes for the fries. I said it may have not been 10 minutes but it was close, and that it was definitely upwards of 30 minutes for our food. She literally argued with me on every point of contention that I had. I could have (and in retrospect, should have) continued to argue with her, especially since I know that I was right. Instead, I told her to have a good day and ended the conversation.  My girlfriend, who has spent the majority of her life in the service industry, agreed that the way it was handled was completely ridiculous. We weren't looking for free food, we weren't rude or making outlandish remarks... we just wanted her to know the situation and that we were less than satisfied. So my girlfriend wrote the Corporate office on their website, hoping for some sort of response... again, nothing. I have also sent them a message on Twitter (@wingsrings) - also to no response. It's clear to me that they couldn't care less and for that reason, I will definitely never return."}
{"text":"Great specials and amazing wings!!! Thai sweet chili boneless wings with blue cheese is the way to go!!!!"}
{"text":"Has good potential. Family fun sports bar themed, with good menu, lots of TVs, large covered patio, and friendly but inconsistent staff. We have been here plenty of times, and it's a mystery each time which version of the place you'll get-- sometimes the place is spotless, food cooked perfectly, and staff is great--- sometimes it is a train wreck all around. I guess it's like a small business vs a franchise. Manager is friendly and hardworking."}
{"text":"The food was great.  The service was awful at best. It's a good thing we ordered quickly because the waitress didn't deliver our food or even offer refills until after our food was eaten. The manager that delivered our food could clearly see that my glass was empty, however he did not offer a refill. He came to the table twice. And still did not offer a refill.  Please do not give this place your money."}
{"text":"Pro: Parmesan aioli fries are amazing Waiter was friendly  Cons: People smoking outside under tent where people are eating, absolutely disgusting! Wrong food came out Wings are super vinegar-y Poor drink selection High prices for low quality"}
{"text":"Went to this establishment based off seeing the franchise on Undercover Boss. Until then I had never heard of them. Went there on a Saturday afternoon. Seated immediately. 2 things..... As we were being lead to the table by the hostess, when we passed one server, you would think she would greet us and welcome us to to the restaurant, or just say hello. But she didn't. It seemed as if she realized we weren't being seated at her table, so why bother to speak. Second they sat us in the far end corner booths by the bathroom. It was very little space in between the table and bench.(and I'm a slim person). Matt was our server. He was cool and polite. Kinda got lost a little bit when we needed a refill. But overall he did good.   Food was good. Wings had a very good taste to them. Had the bourbon bbq. Highly recommend that flavor. Would come back again if in the area, they are about 32 mins away, but I wouldn't go crazy to make it my first choice.  What is also very eye-catching, if you scroll down the reviews, only one person gave a 5, handful of 4, but the majority are 3,2, and 1's. First time I have seen that type of consistency on a Yelp review page."}
{"text":"2 stars because the server was pleasant.  The food portions are very small, prices are high, quality is a fraction over poor.  The restaurant in general was filthy, there was no soap in the men's room, the container was full but nothing was coming out, yes the same restroom the cook used to prepare my food! It appears that they clean rarely, maybe beaten up the place a bit but there are food and drink remnants all over the place, floors, walls and tables.  I failed to check reviews prior to ordering, big mistake on my part.  Looks to me like the classic example of an owner who has more money than sense, it's a shame because the location is good.  Don't be fooled by the good appearance outside, the place is a dump.  John Taffer would have a field day in this place."}
{"text":"Been there twice now and both times the service was horrible, at best. We had to fight them for 20 minutes to change the channel from a random women's basketball game on ESPNU to a top 15 hoops matchup that we specifically went there to watch on ESPN.  When I asked the hostess to change it, she immediately said no, and refused to ask. Right as we were getting up to leave, they finally changed it for our group.   After dropping off our drinks, the waitress disappeared for a good 15-20 minutes, without even asking for our food order. We had to ask another server to find her.   We ordered 15 wings and a Caesar Salad. It took 30 minutes to complete that order.   The food was good, or else this place would have been ranked 0 stars.   I would not ever recommend this place to anyone. You can get food that tastes just as good at a lot of other places, that actually take care of their customers."}
{"text":"Understaffed, though my server is working hard, and food is struggling. Even after new ownership. These are supposed to be fried pickles, not raw pickles."}
{"text":"I saw this place on Undercover Boss and was very excited as I love wings and thought this place would be amazing. Overall, the food wasn't bad, but I was not amazed by the wings. I know there are a few ways they can cook the wings, it would be great if the servers explained each one that way you can get a better idea of what will suit your taste. We'll probably give them another chance seeing as this place is down the road. We'll see how it goes!"}
{"text":"Very torn about this place. They make the best traditional wings around. Unfortunately every other food item we have ordered has disappointed us. Good beer selection with the opportunity to order pitchers rather than just pints. Service is okay - sometimes I wonder why the waitresses are dressed the way they are - probably wouldn't bring my kids here."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite wing joints in South Charlotte. The food is always good, service is not very good (the reason I did not give it 5 stars). We have been several times with average service, we normally get take out. The buffalo chicken nachos are amazing...great to share with your whole table."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and still tried it. What a waste!!  Not only was the waitress rude, the owner was rude as well!  I have owned a buisness myself and let me tell you I would close my doors before I treated customers like he treats customers. STAY AWAY!!  Over priced, rude, and certainly NOT WOTH THE TRIP OUT OF THE HOUSE. Stay home and have a PB&J!"}
{"text":"Not worth bookmarking but certainly a lot better than most the other reviews gave it credit for.  I found the food average for a sports bar but the service was excellent.   The manager was sure to check with every table at least once and our server genuinely cared about our experience.   The only thing I would have changed was the live music.   It just didn't fit the atmosphere of a family friendly sports bar."}
{"text":"I wish there was better to say about this place, but I really don't care to be in this establishment.  Their food is ok to sub-par.  Their terminology of a \"side\" and \"platter\" are never quantified, so you get like 4 onion rings for a side and about a half onion's worth for a platter.  Regardless, they are both pricey.  They also has a lack of options, and drown out that information with huge menus with large photos and text.  On the off and desperate times I'm here, I really have to search for something good to eat.  On the upside, their bathrooms are super clean!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, flavorful wings.  There's a real kick to them, and I count it as a positive that I wasn't able to finish their hottest level of wings that didn't require us to sign a waiver.  Most of the other food is fine.  Typical sports bar feel and everything too, which I like.   But that's where I have to stop my praise and say that the last couple of times I went, the service was TERRIBLE.  I went with a large group (about 15) and ordered a ton of hot wings; maybe it's because we were seated outside, but the server hardly came to us at all.  We were practically begging for water.  After dinner, it felt like there was a 20-30 minute gap between when we asked for the check and actually got it.   It really is a great place to chat and hang out with friends, and watch sports while I eat, so I'll give it another go; however, it really was disappointing last time to know service held them back."}
{"text":"Went there to watch the Sunday night football game - fairly empty bar area so service was top notch! Things that made me happy:  1. The sweet potato fries - I'm a big fan and these are just right, shoestring thin, lightly salted. 2. The boneless wings - high quality chicken, lightly breaded then tossed in hot sauce. Simple, spicy classic. Blue cheese on the side was homemade. 3. The 'Crazy' sauce - some sort of hybrid bbq/buffalo sauce. Mighty tasty. 4. Sweetwater 420 on tap - 'nuff said.  Things I didn't like: 1. Fried pickles - what's up with frying the entire spear? They should learn from the Penguin. 2. Mind-bendingly loud in the bar, not from people but from the TV's! My gosh, it was so bad that I thought my ears would bleed."}
{"text":"Never in a million years did I think I would ever give this place another chance but call me crazy as I decided to give them one more shot and I am beyond shocked to say that this place has done a complete 180 in terms of putting the customer first, as I was personally greeted by both the manager and the new ownership, as they thanked me for making the choice of watching the march madness games at their establishment, given the multitude of options within the Ballantyne area.  Needless to say, this was a welcome surprise given  how I was mentally prepared for the worst but hopeful for the best, given my past one star experiences here that have been well documented on Yelp.  If that wasn't enough, the manager and owner both took the time to ask me my name and the owner actually proceeded to ask if he could sit down and get some feedback from me, which I thought was a fantastic gesture, given how the past regime was so indifferent towards constructive feedback to the point of being defiant even.  Had a great talk with the owner about my past disappointments here and actually showed him and the manager my two previous reviews, and I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised when they didn't argue or challenge but took a stance of humility and acknowledgement towards the past failures, openly admitting that they blew it in the past and have to earn back the trust of their customers one day and one customer at a time.  This was great to hear as it made me feel like they truly valued me as a customer and they were genuinely interested in my feedback on how they could improve.  That is all you can ask for from any business, having the ability to be introspective enough to realize their customers are their lifeline and should never be taken for granted.  Overall, the level of customer service from start to finish was like night and day from my past experiences here, as the employees actually seemed like they were happy to be there and more importantly were happy to have me there.  This has to be one of the most amazing turnarounds I have witnessed in a long time, as I pretty much left this place for dead as I would frequently pass by it on my way to other sports bars in the area, but it seems as though the new ownership is serious about not only listening to their customers but also creating an environment where the customer feels valued and appreciated.  That my friends is what customer service is all about!      P.S.  As great as this experience was, you don't go from one star to five stars overnight, so I will need a few more visits with displayed consistency before these guys get a shot at the five star club, but they are definitely headed in the right direction!  Definitely ask for Cindy as your server if at all possible because she is beyond adorable!  Live music by Lisa De Novo was awesome by the way, as she played tons of popular hits and her cuteness was only surpassed by her musical talent.  Also have to give Jimmy mad props for organizing such an awesome show, great job all of the way around!  Highly recommend you guys check her out as she is proof positive that great things come in small packages!"}
{"text":"Never had any issues so far. Order every tues for $.69 cent wings. Open til 2am. Its sweet."}
{"text":"Went on Monday for \"Burger night.\"  The website shows a big juicy bacon cheeseburger next to the words \"$4.00 burger night\" When I got there I was informed by our server that the special only applied on the plain burger. Oh and no sides are included. When she brought it to the table I thought it was a joke. Here was this poor looking plain hamburger with no toppings (lettuce tomato etc) on a tiny white plate on a bun tat had obvious finger print holes in it. I can not believe they would have let that leave the kitchen. Well it's now easy to figure out why this place is always so empty!"}
{"text":"Wing were good but I prefer them to be grilled and this is not a option anymore. The server Brian did a get job and made good recommendation to meet expectations of group."}
{"text":"Went here after a sports competition on a Saturday night. The place was completely packed, and they had (8) Kansas vs. (4) Missouri on the tv sets mixed with some local basketball teams. Drinks came out somewhat slow, although that was somewhat expected. I ordered the barbecue burger (or whatever it was) sans bacon and the onion rings, so essentially it was a burger with cheese and barbecue sauce. It was okay. The bun was okay, the burger was okay, the sauce was somewhat below average. For the same burger, I actually preferred Chili's rendition, and I'm not a big Chili's fan. The fries were very good, although there was no ketchup on the table, and the waitress didn't come around. Oh well. Drink refills were somewhat slow--we had to get the waitress over to refill the drinks. They dimmed the lights and killed the basketball to put UFC on every tv. Very disappointing--not a big UFC fan at all. Overall there's really not a great reason to come back other than it's within 5 minutes of my house."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and was surprised how good it was as we saw all the terrible Yelp reviews. The boneless wings are very good, fresh, all chicken breasts. Lots of very good sauce options. Apparently they underwent a change of management almost a year ago--so I'm assuming most of the reviews were from that. Definitely give this place a try. Much better than the boneless wings at Buffalo Wild Wings. Good bar atmosphere with lots of TVs as well."}
{"text":"Thai wing sauce HOT is so oooo good. I probably could've spiced it up 1 more notch. Yummy homemade bluecheese sauce. Gotta try the wedges, fries with garlic aoli sauce, and gyros!!!! Great service! Great food! Fast service!"}
{"text":"Ugh, bad. Before I got into the many bad things, I will say the food was pretty good. My husband and I like wings and they were pretty good. With that being said, the good ends there.  We were seated immediately but weren't spoken to for 10 minutes after we sat down. We waived a server down & she told us she'd wait on us. We were ready to order and she couldn't get anything straight...she obviously had her mind somewhere else. She gradually brought our food and drinks but never plates or silverware. We finally got another server to get those for us. As we sat there, we watched the wait staff- they were all very slow & didn't seem like they had a care in the world. There was one server that may have either been drunk or high- he was bumping into stuff and totally out of it.   When we finally got our wings, they were good. However, we ordered garlic Parmesan but what we got weren't garlic Parmesan.  We told our server after we at 2 of the 5 (we tried to wave her down for over 5 minutes ) and she basically just said \"sorry\"... we never saw her again. Finally a manager came to our table to ask us how everything was. She told us she was sorry and brought our check with two $5 gift cards....really? Like $10 is going to get us in the door again? I don't think so. She was very nice, but this was handled very poorly.   It's too bad because we really wanted to like this place. We eat out a lot & were looking forward to it, especially because the ambiance is so cool. No way will we ever step foot in here again."}
{"text":"One of our regular spots here... This place serves arguably the best wings I've ever had and it's also got a good selection of beers!  We love the outside tables (where the music is not so loud and it feels more relaxed), but they definitely need to improve their service.  I didn't give them 4 starts just because of that - they do tend to get swamped very easily..."}
{"text":"We live so close we just had to try this place. They have the NFL ticket and great tvs, which is why this place is getting two stars. Arrived early so I stopped at the bar to wait and ordered the run hurricane. I don't know if the juice was old or if they use a lime syrup, but the drink was really tart and sweet.. Not a hurricane. The bartender didn't look like he wanted to be there, I wasn't about to ask him to remake/replace it. You shouldn't feel like an annoyance to your service staff, so we relocated.  We went out to the patio for dinner and ordered a variety of items. The boneless wings were hard. Too much fried breading, not enough meat. Then the traditional wings could have used another five minutes in the fryer. They weren't raw, but the fat wasn't crispy either. Overall, I expected more from a wings place.our server Liz was very good though.  On to the ladies room. I didn't expect for a restaurant toilet to have throw up backsplash.. But there it was.. Right next to the dirty plunger.   Our sever Liz and the football watching earned this place two stars more than it deserves."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is that of a typical sports bar. The food is hot and fresh and the wing sauces are plenty. However, whatever you do, DO NOT TRY THE TRUE DEATH CHALLENGE. YOU WILL LITERALLY DIE! I am a frequent spicy food daredevil, but this challenge is insane. I tried one wing from management to just see, because I can't keep up with the challenge requirements. It only took seconds before having to stop because the heat and pain was so overwhelming. That night, I had to make a trip to the ER due to excruciating pain in my stomach. Turns out, I had to induce vomiting to get the remnants of that wing out of my stomach. It was miserable."}
{"text":"We had the teriyaki wings, buffalo/mild, and veggie burger without the bun.  Food was good but it was odd that they brought out my wifes broccoli still in its plastic baggie...apparently fresh from its nuking, nice; but other than that good food and service."}
{"text":"We've been to his place a bunch of times in the past few weeks because it is not for from our house. The wings are good. However I can only give 3 stars because the rings, onion rings are frozen and not fresh. On a recent visit I was told that it was called rings because of curly fries they used to serve.  Fresh ingredients make better food. Like the Saratoga chips. They are very good.   I do takeout here on the weekends and it never seems smooth. I understand it is Sunday and football is on. I am buying wings to watch football and eat them. It just always seems like a clunky process, for one reason or another; maybe it's just my luck.   See you next Sunday."}
{"text":"With new ownership I hoped that this place would gear up on their service and quality of food. Nothing has changed. We come here weekly for trivia and the only thing that brings me back is Mike, the trivia host. There are only 2 waiters here that are worth anything. Tonight I walked in and there a 2 hostess, one of them had more important things in her phone to tend to. The server was inattentive and focused more on the host stand than his guest. The manager walked by me twice while I stood up and tried to get my servers attention.  I would only recommend this place on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! Our waiter Matthew was phenomenal! After our bad experience at Lorenzo's pizza, we came here and it was way more than awesome. I wish I could put more stars! Highly recommend this place. & the manager is amazing."}
{"text":"You guys are about 10 health code violations in in 45 minutes.  1. Server came up to seat us while still eating.  Put us at a dirty table facing the kitchen ( great spot for us to see what's to follow)  Our server was great BUT  2. Cooks eating on the grill line with no gloves.  No washed hands either.  3.  Cooks coming out to the service portion of the restaurant while still eating.  Still no gloves.  Right in front of the manager.  Not a word.  No hand washing.  4.  Manager picking his nose while traying up food.  5.  Food came out ice cold.  Wings had clearly been sitting in the basket waiting for an order.  Clearly also frozen and flash cooked rather than thawed.  Taste evident and confirmed by listening to group of 4 servers eating at the service window while traying up food.  5.  Manager drinking a beer while working and after picking his nose, dipped his finger in someone's food, stuck it in his mouth, then took out the order.  6.  Went to the bathroom.  BIG mistake.  Watched cook who had been eating on floor come in, use the restroom, play with his hair, wipe the grease off of the front of his apron, stick one finger in his mouth, did not wash his hands.  7.  Congregation of servers at a table sharing food while on the clock, then running to tray up food and take it to tables.  One dribbled monster energy drink into someone's food while engaged in the group convo, took the food out anyways.  8.  Food Poisoning.  My girlfriend and I are both sick.  Go figure.    This is just off the top of my head.  I am not a complainer.  I will not be back.  At this point, I should receive a full refund, my server Lacie should receive a pat on the back for working in those conditions, and in return I wont call the health department.  These clowns should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.  This is not just a matter of bad food or bad service.  This is irresponsible restaurant management and they are going to get more people sick."}
{"text":"I am basing this review on three things 1) Service 2) Food Quality and 3) Overall experience. We were just two people on a day where the restaurant must have been finishing a \"big rush\". Our seats were in the bar area right next to the wall where you could see and hear everything in the kitchen.      1) The server we was completely forgettable. Not friendly just there. Greeted in a timely manor however was not seen again really until it was time to drop the check. Bothered me a little with the long hair down and kept running her hands through it and would touch plates at the table or in the window.      2) We started by ordering the bbq chicken nachos no jalapenos. After what seemed like a long time, I looked over to notice nachos sitting in the expo window. Another five minutes pass and finally the person in charge of getting the food out of the kitchen started yelling about nachos running 14 minutes. There was a back and forth with the cook of which we watched the person in the kitchen pulled the old nachos out of the window to remove the jalapenos from the nachos(no gloves) and send them out of the kitchen right to our table. We declined the nachos and gave the honest answer as to why(also note they were the Buffalo nachos not the BBQ). The wings were bland and just not right while the fries seemed like they were on the end of their shelf life and on the dead side.     3) This was the worst part about the over all experience was the management. We realized the person in the kitchen who pulled the jalapenos off the nachos was the manager on duty. After he exited the kitchen it was obvious there were other problems in the restaurant because he stood in the server isle and started to yell at his staff loud enough were we could hear. I get it everyone has their day but really? You have guest in your dining room and to belittle your staff like that was just not right. Take them back behind the door to yell. Even more so if you are so worried about your staff talk to the group who were sitting at the table at the end of the bar.     Again just over all fail. My date left still hungry and I left feeling sick to my stomach.... I do not know if it was because the food was that bad or I was upset that I wasted my date night and money on this place that should consider a serious management overhaul."}
{"text":"Love their fried pickles.Beer selection is good too. Went on the Big Game day,enjoyed it."}
{"text":"First impressions last.  I came to check out this place for the first time today at lunch.  I came in, no smiles, no greetings, just a glum face from this young-looking hostess.  I grabbed a menu, looked at it and still nothing from the hostess wearing a Panthers jersey.  I finally came up to her and ordered takeout.  Bottom line, I deal with people all the time and I'm a big believer of good customer service.  This place has none.  And that's on the manager.  I give it two stars for the decent food and, for the waitress checking on my takeout to make sure everything is there.  There is a pattern of bad reviews.  The manager needs to get it together.  I am not coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a coworker and while the service was poor ( Suzanne took a few minutes to seat us even though we were the only people there, screwed up our sodas and took about 10 minutes to get our check from the table to run the card ), the food was really good!  I had the lunch chicken pita with onion rings and it was point on! I got some xtra hot on the side and it was good (though next time I'm trying atomic since the xtra didn't make me reach for my water). My coworker got the 5 wings with a side salad and fries. Looked good, and he said they were on point (he got the garlic wings).  All in all the food was 4 star, but the service was sadly lacking in a big way (especially for being so slow!). I'll try it again, and update my review accordingly!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. Wasn't too packed. Our waiter took 10 mins to get our drinks. Took another 10-15 mins to order our food. Waited an additional 10-15 mins for us to actually get our food. The food was good but the service was NOT. Probably won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Skip this joint. How do you have the name RINGS in your name and serve frozen onion pre-made onion rings? So disappointing. The chicken wings were so so, probably frozen too. We were there on a game day and it was just blah blah blah....waitresses in see through black leggings talking betwixt themselves instead of providing good service. They should have paid us to eat that crap."}
{"text":"Awful food and young untrained staff. My quesadilla was soft and undercooked along with the fries. Beer selection is nothing special and anything craft is often 'sold out'. Please go else where."}
{"text":"if you want to nibble on snack food and drink beer and watch a game then GREAT--- go here.  It is a sports bar, it is far from a family place to eat lunch for sure. there are TV's everywhere. The wings are just ok, nothing to brag about here. I orgered the lemon pepper wings, which when the menu says pick your SAUCE I figure that is a wet thing. uh no. my wings were fried and then lemon pepper seasoning dumped on them. What I find very wrong is they charge you extra if you want ranch/blue cheese dipping sauce or celery???? WHAT? as if the wings are not expensive enough now I have to shell out $$ for what should be included.  Our waitress was sorta clueless as she gave someone else our ticket and they had already left. now we made out a little better cuz it was about $2 cheaper but I cant believe she didnt even try to fix it.  We wont be back"}
{"text":"Never ever come here!!! If you would like to know why please feel free to message me! More importantly than anything the food is gross"}
{"text":"We've been visiting this restaurant off and on for over two years. Each time we go, the service is wretched so we'd wait a few months and try it again. The staff turns over quickly and never seems to be properly trained. But, the food is good which is what kept us going back. Went back today after 6 months or so. The service was even worse than before and seemed far more chaotic than usual. We sat outside. Waited over 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order. It got worse from there...appetizer was dropped off by a random server and left without providing plates, napkins, utensils. We waited a few minutes then ended up stealing some from other tables. Our server brought our wings out along with a tray full of food for another table. She struggles to get outside with the tray, dropped off our wings and struggled to get back inside with the full tray. She had no plates, no utensils, no dressing or celery. So we sat...and sat...and sat. When we finally got everything we needed to eat, the wings were no longer hot. As all of this was going on, it was obvious that it wasn't the servers who were at fault. It was lack of organization and direction. We asked to see the manager.  The owner/manager comes out and we explained the whole scenario and how frustrated we were. She proceeded to say that she didn't know the weather was going to be so nice and that everyone would want to be outside so she didn't have the staff to manage the customers efficiently. According to her, all of the servers who were there were \"making $10/hour and twiddling their thumbs.\" She went on to say that she \"didn't even have enough food and had been shopping for the last hour to buy more. I'm not making excuses but that's the way it is.\" I told her that we'd given them many chances and that it's obvious that the problem is with management not the servers and that we wouldn't be back. Her response? \"That's your prerogative.\" Now we know why the service is so poor and turnover is so high...it trickles down from the top."}
{"text":"Very typical sports bar setting - many tv's.   We were ordering the big tall beer container things which held about 7 beers for $14 - great idea for a game with friends.   I cannot comment on food - but they appear to have typical fried bar food.    Service was spotty but friendly. I asked for a water- which was forgotten but she eventually remembered about 10 min later. I wasn't overly concerned about this though but I could imagine it may be a problem if the place was busy and/or you really were thirsty/hungry.   Since I am not much of a sports patron I might not go back - but if you are (and happen to live close by) this may be your place !"}
{"text":"The service was good and is why I am giving this review one star. My issue is the prices. We ordered wings and an appetizer, no alcohol and the bill came out over 50 dollars, which is crazy for the food quality we received. The food was good but it was not that good."}
{"text":"Eh... Parking lot is always packed. We got sat right away and service was ok. I know maybe I shouldn't of gotten a burger at a wing place but I did. Burger was dry and over cooked. We also got an order of wings. They were ok, just not very memorable."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but the service is HORRIBLE! I love anything with Buffalo sauce and anytime I have gone there and actually received my order correctly and in time to get back to work it has been good. However, on two separate occasions I did not receive my order after an hour wait. On several other occasions I received the wrong order, no drink refills and rude service. I find that if I go with male colleagues the service is a little better but when at lunch with all females the service is horrid."}
{"text":"We just moved to Charlotte and it was our first time at this place and it was fantastic! My fiancé is very picky about his wings so he was very happy to find a place that he can call his go to for wings. The atmosphere was very fun and inviting as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a nice atmosphere. There are more televisions than I can count so great for game days. I also love the trivia nights from 7-9 on Wednesdays. However, the food leaves little to be desired. There are not many options for vegetarians and the food is vey greasy. I have ordered the swine nachos multiple times and Every Time there are different ingredients in the dish. I also think it could use another name."}
{"text":"I soooooo wanted to give this place a good review because they are close by and the service was really good. However, both occasions the food was pretty weak.  The first time I got a hot buffalo chicken wrap and Parmesan fries. The fries were really yummy, dipped in dressing and cheese. However, the chicken in the wrap was soooo dry and sparse, and had barely any sauce on it.  I hoped it was a fluke and just went back on Tuesday 69 cent wing night. We got hot buffalo (extra wet), garlic q and garlic parm. My hubby and I agreed it was some of the worst wings we've ever had. Definitely edible, if you're starving, but the wings were burnt to a crisp, it almost tasted like jerky. The best of the worst was the extra wet buffalo because the gallon of sauce distracted from the dry chicken bone. However, I wouldn't touch the other flavor ones since they were sooo burnt with little sauce and made my husband eat them. I'm not one to complain, the server was so nice, so perhaps shame on me for not sending the food back. Either way, I'm not so sure we will try it a third time. If you're a wing place, how do you screw those up??? Corporate has to be doing something wrong and it's not their fault?? No idea but unless something changes, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Boy, was this place a disappointment.    The wings were OK (not great), the \"rings\" were good (not great).  The service is AWFUL.  Mostly children working here.  They don't drink beer, so if you order one, they slap a bottle down on the table and walk away.  They don't ask if you want a cold glass.  I blame the manager for not training them properly.  Of course, they're only going to work there 2 months at most, then school starts again.   Speaking of the manger, he was standing by the bar, looking like a guard dog.  Every time someone's food arrived, he would count to 20 or so, then walk over and ask them  how everything is.  Then, he returned to his post.  My girlfriend tried to flag him down before our food came to ask a question, and he ignored us and walked right by.    The evening I had dinner here, they were doing a trivia game.  Most places have electronic consoles and TV screens; this place had a guy that sounded like a strip club DJ, on a microphone the ENTIRE time we were in there, shouting questions to the entire restaurant.  It was obnoxious and made it impossible to have a conversation over the noise.  I'll drive the extra 5-8 miles to go to BWW from now on."}
{"text":"Been here about 2-3 times and finally thought it was time to write a review.   I am a really big fan of the wings at the place because they come drenched in a sauce of your choosing. Some people are not a fan because of this, but I think the wings pack a lot of flavor and not bland like most other places. On Tuesdays, they offer a special for $.49 a wing and you can definitely get full of $5-8 worth of wings. I also really really like the Gyro Quesadilla.   Other than that, the food is pretty average. Standard burgers, salads and \"bar\" type food. Be aware that their dishes are served with their own homemade chips and not french fries. They're really good, but I would prefer to have fries."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really the only bar/grill in our neighborhood and the convenience can't be beat. Unfortunately the food and service can. This our third and last time visiting. The food is miserable and lacking. The service is worse. Good luck seeing your waiter at all. It took us 25 min to get our app and when it came out, it was cold; clearly sitting out for a while. Our entree came right on top of it two min later. Pictured you will see a cup that was served to me which was absolutely disgusting. Honestly this place needs new management desperately. The location and potential clientele is there and this place could be a staple in the community. Until then, don't waste your time eating here."}
{"text":"Yeah the service, and food are terrible. The wings,... That can't be real chicken... I ordered shrimp tacos... 3 of the tiniest  shrimp I've ever seen on a stale burrito. I can't eat this stuff.  When I do have to come here to meet a friend, I only get beer. Which sucks too because I have to deal with the snobby and entitled staff. These girls are the worst. Catty, slow and don't care about anything except for what their hair looks like.   Go to DD Peckers in Pineville. While it may look sketchy, they have the very wings and people in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Another \"NOT SO GREAT\" situation that you end up sharing with others....here goes:: This place has very delicious wings....49 cents per wing every Tuesday...heck yeah! They are FRESH, not frozen..the sauces are very tasty too.  HOWEVER......on my 4th visit:  I placed my order (to-go)...10 minute wait (great, I'll just run next door to Fresh & Easy)...I came back 30 minutes later to pick up my order and they are like, \"uh-oh, we didn't know anything about it...\"....DUH! WTH!   They tell me that \"the guy who took my order left and didn't say anything about it...\" They continue to tell me that they didn't know who the order  belonged to...(I guess a take-out order is quite a bizarre concept, esp when the customer places the order, then comes back for it...)  Two-three people come out to tell me \"It's no big deal, we'll have it ready in 3 minutes\"...2 more people come out to apologize...   When the guy (manager?) hands me my order, he lets me know that he included the RANCH, because they usually charge for it (oh WOW! I feel so special now!)...and that he also included a couple of coupons for my next visit (trying to smooth over the situation with a coupon for \"get 5 free wing with gyro PURCHASE\"  just doesn't work...very tacky).  Honestly, it takes a situation like this to really turn off a customer from returning back again."}
{"text":"I think this place is cool to hang out at, food is getting better and better. Good drinks at a good price. They do poker and other things that are cool. Cool friendly employees and good vibes."}
{"text":"Ill be honest,  buffalo wild wings is a bit better.   They wont let you order wings individually so you can try more flavors. The wings were also very small.  The sauce that I did get was tasty.  For the most part its a cheap imitation whose source isn't all that great to begin with."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy Buffalo Wings and Rings for just a \"down' evening. Very Casual and upbeat. Game days can be loud. Food is great for wings and nachos, salads are tasty as are sandwiches. Typical sports bar fare."}
{"text":"Want good food and drinks with a good atmosphere? Then this isn't the place for you! Can't really say much more than my party walking out before we even got our drinks. Took roughly 20 minutes after we ordered our drinks before we got fed up and left! Save yourself the trip and go else where."}
{"text":"So let's just be clear, if your looking for decent service, you should go somewhere else. The service is the BIGGEST problem with the restaurant.  However, if your looking for an amazing wing sauce, and some of the best house made blue cheese and possibly a cold draft beer selection, then and only then will you want to go to this establishment ( to say they're as welcoming and friendly as the old mean lunch lady (and not Chris Farley's version), would be an understatement). I walk in and there are 3 hostesses or employees standing at the host stand talking and do not bother to turn around and greet me or say HI!, so I walk past them and seat myself. OOOO-K...Then I sit at the bar and I look at the clock, it took the bartender 6 minutes to greet me. I worked in this industry and for a table it was a minute, but for door greetings, bar greeting, store greetings, a customer should be greeted within 30 seconds. A hi, hello, be with you, SMILE, ANYTHING! Comes over does not apologize for the wait. I almost feel bad promoting how good the wings are because I do not believe in giving business to an establishment that doesn't pride them self in service.  If i had a great experience with service this place could be a 4 or 5! Now I do to-go only!"}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere! My family ordered boneless wings, wings, burgers and a buffalo sandwich. The boneless wings were awesome my son inhaled them! My daughter got the BBQ wings and cleaned the bones totally! My hubby had a black and blue burger and was very impressed - he is very picky about his burgers and said he would order that again!! I enjoyed the buffalo chicken club sandwich with a side of broccoli. It was cooked perfectly! We can't wait to visit again!!"}
{"text":"Good food with decent prices. However the managers need to get there staff in line. We walked in and only one other family was there and some guys at the bar. We got seated and it took over 15 mins for me to stand up and go to the hostess table were several wait staff were all talking and I had to ask for help. Once we got someone it went fine. However a lot of the wait staff were standing around doing nothing with several tables needing to be wiped off. I blame the management for lack of poor leadership."}
{"text":"I've ordered wings from this place several times in the past and exclusively order the boneless grilled (non-breaded) wings.  My wife and I are always hesitant to order from here because we have gotten a lot of gross pieces of grilled wings before, the kind of pieces that contain the nasty chewy bits that make you want to gag.  However, yesterday's experience was significantly better. My wife ordered 5 boneless grilled lemon pepper wings and I ordered 10 boneless fried wings, with two different sauce flavors.  I was very pleased with the wings after I got home.  My wife's wings were better than normal and my fried wings were absolutely huge and covered in sauce.  I could only eat 6 of the 10 wings because they were so big.  I'm not sure if the place changed something but I hope they keep this up."}
{"text":"This place was great! My whole family loves the food, great service and a nice place. This was our first visit and we will def come back! Boneless wings had lots of great options as well."}
{"text":"Honestly at first I was wondering why this place had such a bad rating cause I live just a minute away however I found out why. DO NOT go for lunch, during lunch they don't have many people working and the service stinks but this places focuses more on dinner. During dinner hours they're awesome there's a whole lot more people working and the service is much better. All their food is actually really good. For wings the sweet Thai chili, peach habanero, garlic a, and there are a few others I can't remember but the three I listed are really good. Their version of the mushroom Swiss burger, also very good. Bacon Mac and cheese, onion rings, deluxe nachos (i think that's what they're called) is so big you can't eat it by yourself. They also have buffalo chicken nachos which are smaller than the deluxe and that also tastes very good. They have a good selection of beers and they also have hookah."}
{"text":"I hate to do this, but since my initial review, Buffolo Wings & Rings has been a complete disaster and today's visit makes me change my review. The servers, or teenagers, all seem to have attitudes and don't care about taking care of their customers. I received the wrong order today and when I told the waitress she gave me an attitude and told me that is not what she wrote down, okay, what you wrote down was not what I told you. After that I was unable to locate her until I got my check. And, being one of only two tables at noon, why would it take over 45 minutes to receive a sandwich, ridiculous. I will stick to wings somewhere else."}
{"text":"We heard that this bar shows UFC events without a cover charge...they just request that you spend $15 per person. Not a problem for me. With a deal like this, we went back.  Anyhoo, this time, we stuck to wings, appetizers, and beer. I have to say that I'm now a fan of their wings. We got BBQ, Garlic Parmesean, and the classic Buffalo flavors. The wings are definitely the biggest I've seen, and the flavors are awesome!  They have also made a few upgrades to the decor inside...a lot more attractive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best wings around ... love this joint... great ambiance for wings & beer / the staff is always super nice and he beers are always super cold ... there's a ton of flat screens running sports shows ... just a perfect spot !"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would.  Hostess was extremely busy texting someone on her phone to notice us.  Finally noticed us and said there was a 10 minute wait. Every booth in the place was empty except they were all never bussed.  Nasty attitude and filthy restaurant. Went to Hickory Tavern instead and got seated right away. Good food and friendly service.  Buffalo wings and rings should be out of business shortly with the horrible attitudes, and disgusting tables."}
{"text":"I am torn because I really wanted to like this place, and there certainly are plenty of reasons to as well.  The staff is overly  friendly and nice, the place is new so it was clean and the service was good- even for opening night.    The problem I had was the wings themselves, they tasted like something you would get in the deli at a grocery store- they were small and the sauce, while hot, lacked any original flavor.    I will probably go back based on how nice everyone was, but just to have a cold beer and watch a game.  The wings were a disappointment."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick take out order and to tell the truth I'm glad we didn't go for dinner. Probably a great place to watch a game with twenty TV's around the bar but not really a place I would go to if there wasn't a game. Got 10 wings and 5 really small potato skins for $25 dollars. Again probably a great place for the game, otherwise we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was awful! Service was more than under par, and the food was very unsatisfactory! I'm a southern woman, and never have I disliked fried pickles, but they were gross. The ranch dressing was nasty, and the garlic Parmesan fries were inedible! My tab was $50, yet I left with only paying the tip (which was my nice gesture for the day). I've now been there twice....both my first & last time! Please do not waste your time."}
