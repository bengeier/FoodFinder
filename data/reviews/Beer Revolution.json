{"text":"You never know what kind of beer will be on top. If you love trying beers you don't see on a regular basis, go to Beer Revolution!  The beer list changes right before you eyes.  Food is a good complement (pizza is awesome) but you really go here for the beer experience."}
{"text":"The best place in Calgary to find a diverse tap list of original craft beers. Yes, they have fewer taps than some of the numerous beer bars locally, but they will always have things you have not tried and actually want to try. Other than the 2 Brewsters beers that are always available, each keg is the only one of that beer they have in stock, so visiting twice in 2 weeks will often give you an entirely new list of brews to taste. I had my first Mikkeller here; I never see them on tap anywhere else in town.  Even when I am familiar with the featured breweries, the choices will often be brand new or limited edition beers I haven't yet tried.   Short menu of pretty good food; pizza can be made gluten free and they are usually willing to remove a topping or two if you have special preferences (for example, vegetarian). They've made me a pizza with two different halves more than once. Also, surprisingly good cheese board for a beer bar!  The green pepper Madagascar is worth trying at least once.   Accessible if you enter through Brewsters on 11th Ave. Enough low tables mixed in with the high ones so that people in wheelchairs should be able to find a place to sit with others. I haven't tried the accessible washroom, but the door looks heavy."}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing and a great beer selection too! The staff was friendly and helpful. One of our Calgary faves"}
{"text":"Delish!!! Had the fries and they came in a generous portion of sweet potato and regular potato fries with this amazing dip! I had the junior boy pizza which was delicious and filling, especially after all those fries (for only $4!!) i was intrigued by the maple syrup and it turned out to be awesome! My boyfriend had the fuzzy peach beer and said it was smooth and wasn't bitter and was good! He also had the ceased pizza which actually comes with a ceased salad on top. The portions are large I definitely don't suggest ordering a whole one to yourself because we made that mistake and will have leftovers for days!"}
{"text":"My apologies for the long review - in an nutshell, I'm a regular here who won't be so regular after today's visit. The beers are good, the pizza can be hit or miss, the service is EXTREMELY slow.  I have been to this place probably over 25 times for beer and pizza, as I work right across the street. My co-workers and I tend to go for a beer after work every Friday and we go for lunch here around 3 times a month but I haven't been compelled to write a review until now.  The last few times we have went for lunch, we have waited between 30-45 minutes to get our food. It doesn't matter if we go at 11:30 a.m. or 1:30 p.m. There could be 2 other tables in the whole place and we will still have a lengthy wait.  Today, 4 of us went for lunch. 3 of us ordered a lunch size pizzas and 1 ordered a lunch size, gluten free pizza. Given that we go here so often, we usually don't take a look at the menu, we always get the same thing. Our pizzas came after 45 minutes (prompting the manager to offer us a 30% discount, which was nice), and the gluten-free pizza, while it looked a little larger than the other lunch sized pizzas, was not the size of a regular pizza, however when the bill came, my coworker discovered she had been charged for a full size pizza.  The waitress had conveniently forgot to mention that the lunch size pizzas don't come in gluten free and proceeded to order a full size pizza for one person, which she barely ate any of because it was terrible. The waitress' words were \"oh sorry I guess I should have mentioned the gluten-free pizzas don't come in lunch size, but it says that on the menu.\" As I mentioned, we don't usually take a look at the menus because we're here so often. Don't you think you should have said when my coworker ordered a \"lunch-size, gluten-free\" pizza that that doesn't exist in Beer Revolution world?  Since we had already gotten a discount for our food taking a coon's age to get to our table, nothing more was offered.  I know this doesn't sound like much of an issue, but we are regulars there and the service is declining rapidly. The managers are always very nice and have offered us discounts multiple times because of the length of time we wait, but they shouldn't have to do that every time we go in. I'll still go here for beers after work (the peach fuzz is delicious), but since I only have an hour for lunch and don't like slow, rude service, I won't be making the trip across the street for a lunch-time pizza again anytime soon."}
{"text":"In Calgary for work and this place is literally across a parking lot from where I'm staying. I couldn't resist a place called \"Beer Revolution\".  I had the most delicious pizza (blazing saddle - great movie, great pizza) and my server was awesome. When I told her what I liked she recommended beers that were spot on. I enjoy trying new beers from places I would not have normally chosen. For people who like what they like in this regard, this may not be the place for you. They serve micro brew from around the world, not the usual suspects (e.g. bud, coors, molson, kokanee etc.) BUT the staff is knowledgeable so if you tell them what you like, you'll definitely get something similar.. be specific so they can help you find something you like. They also offer tasters so don't be shy - try something new!  I was there solo and the whole experience was awesome from the second I walked in. The person that greeted me was so nice and didn't mind I took up a table of four just to myself.  They have lots of TVs so if you're looking for a game, they're probably showing it.  Could use a bit more extensive Bourbon selection but that's just because I love a good old Kentucky Bourbon after a meal.   That said, this is a beer place (and a pretty wicked one at that) so if you don't like beer or aren't feeling adventurous there's a Boston Pizza nearby I hear."}
{"text":"Was here last night, I really want to like this place as it's close to home. I like the large selection of beer and the interior, it comfortable and clean. The service was OK, not great as it took sometime to get new drinks etc but it was passable. What I really didn't like was the food. Last night was the pretzel special (regular 9.00 on for 2.00) I go ahead and order one for me and my boyfriend to share, thinking, if it's 9.00 regular it must be a big pretzel! Very wrong, the pretzel is smaller than my hand. If I had paid full price for this I would have felt ripped off. My boyfriend commented that they probably have the special because no one would ever order them for regular price and they need to use them up. Same problem with the sticky wings, they had the bulk of my pinky finger! The sauce was good, but these were obviously VERY cheap wings. Everyone around us was having pizza and we should have followed suit, stick with the pizza, avoid the apps~!"}
{"text":"excellent place for a nice beer and great food.   Staff is knowledgable on the brews and will often recommend something to you based on your tastes.  My fav is the peach beer.  I didn't think I would like it, but it is light and crisp.  Pizza is excellent, as is the cheese and meat board.    YUM"}
{"text":"If you want to have good beer and pub food, this is the place to be! I love their selection of beers and menu. The place is well maintained. I hate to walk in the pub and have the old neighbourhood loser pub feel. This place is bright, casual and modern to my liking.  I have been there couple of times, my favourite dish is crab cake salad and pizza. The crab cakes are decent in size and the salad is seasoned just about right. The pizza is fantastic! They have several flavours and the crust is freshly made and bake to perfection! It is my favourite pub in town."}
{"text":"I am not the best person to review somewhere like this because I can't sample the beers or most of the food. *sigh* I am a rare breed of gal that likes beer. Really likes beer. Not just any old can of basic lager but mix and match beer to the food and occasion and mood type of beer-liking gal. And now I can't have it. Occasionally there will be a restaurant that has a gf beer but most of the time not. Except for here. At Beer Revolution I actually have a choice of gluten-free beers, most of which are worth drinking. So for that-I salute you! Cheers, Salud, Sante, Sl√†inte, Subhakamana and Dai Bozhe!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now and I must say, it is one of my favourite craft beer places in the city. I like how the restaurant isn't so big that it's hard to find your friends when you're meeting there. But it doesn't feel too small at the same time. The beer list is displayed on screens all around the bar, making it easy to select your next drink.  I had their Blazing Saddle Wrap and it really hit the spot! It's nice to have something a little different than a burger or even a standard steak sandwich every once in a while.  I will definitely be back, there's still so many more beer to try!"}
{"text":"Food Rating: 8.5/10 Ambience: 8/10 Service: 10/10  Went to Beer Revolution on Friday because National and Craft was crazy packed. Was very glad we made a stop there.  First off, we had the Friday Cask beer and the Peach Fuzz (both 16 oz.). The Cask beer wasn't as carbonated, so it didn't taste that good, it tastes bitter and leaves a bitter taste lingering in your mouth. The Peach Fuzz on the other hand was pretty good. It smelled and tasted like peaches.   Had the Bavarian Pretzels and Nachos to start. The pretzels came with 3, it was still steaming hot when it got to us. The pretzels were soft and moist, and the aioli that came with it gives the pretzels a little kick to it! Though it had a little too much salt on the middle of the pretzel like my liking, you can easily scrap it off.  As for the nachos, it isn't as big as the ones you get from Classical Jack's or Hudson's, but I really liked it. The fresh slivers of green onion on the nachos won me over. And to separate themselves from Hudson's and Classic Jack's a little more, they had banana peppers on them! At the beginning, it was really crispy and wasn't soggy, even with the amount of cheese that was on it. Near the end of the meal, the chips got extremely soggy, probably because of the cheese and tomato. If we polished it off earlier, we wouldn't have had that problem. But nonetheless, I really liked it.   Next, we had the Blazing Saddle Pizza. The pizza is ~12 inches and was cut into 10 slices. The crust is very thin, crispy, and not oily. The pizza was a little spicy with the Cajun powder and banana peppers. The crispy onions added some texture and the arugula added some freshness to it. Didn't really notice the taste of the steak because of all the spice and the sauce, but it was tender. The bacon was soft and smoky.  Finished the night off with a Ginger Ale and a Hoegaarden. The bill after tax and tip was $85. The server was amazing, checked out all her tables and was very nice and friendly. The hostess/manager was a very nice and friendly guy as well. Sent us a text instead of calling to tell us our table was ready, first time! It's a pretty small place for a pub, will definitely check it out again when there's a game on! Definitely going back to try out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Beer revolution is just what downtown Calgary needed, a place with inventive food and a way to really showcase micro brews and local beers.   The ever changing beer menus, which are set up like a flight schedule at the airport, give this place that little something extra. Every Friday they tap a cask ale at around 5:00 pm, a little salute to the weekend I suppose!    They also have really great food, a small menu and mostly pizza, but that's all they need cause what's on it is all good!   Best menu items, in my opinion (but backed up by others I have noticed): - Beer Revolution Peach Beer: one of the few that's always on tap, they even float a little frozen peach on top -Sticky Curry Chicken Wings: jut watch out, your fingers turn a bit yellow! -Pretzels: mostly cause of the dipping sauce - Caesar Salad Pizza: you may not think that this would be good...and it's not...IT'S AMAZING - Montreal Smoked Meat Pizza - bechamel sauce, arugula and smoked meat are the perfect combination  I highly recommend Beer Revolution...and now I'm craving their pizza..."}
{"text":"Great pizza, we tried the junior boy which is their take on hawaiian pizza. It was excellent, the crust was VERY crunchy and you could tell it just came out of the oven, the toppings were good quality and not your typical pizza-place variety. The Maple Syrup was an amazing addition and was not overpowering. The beer board is really neat and they have an excellent selection of craft beers. My wife had a bellini which was very good as well.   Been there a few times and would say its one of the best places in the city for a relaxing night of pizza and beer."}
{"text":"Staying at the Nuvo hotel on a freezing cold October day in Calgary, I'll just run to Yelp to find the closest good quality place for a drink and some grub. So Beer Revolution it was.  This is what it is - dozens of screens showing the big game, high volume conversations, and wait staff wearing skimpy black dresses. These are not normally my favourite attributes in a bar. However the fantastic beer menu, along with a knowledgeable waitress who recommended a good porter, more than made up for it.  The food was a bit hit and miss at our table. My pizza (something with pineapple, proscuitto, jalapenos, and maple syrup) was actually very good. My boss had one with figs on it (called the Newton) and it was sadly bland.  That said, I'm still going with four stars because I left with a smile on my face. Even if the Lions lost to the Stamps, which I was sad about - but I kept that to myself. Best to be careful in Cowtown.  #30DaysOfYelp (27/30)"}
{"text":"Best rotating beer menu in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Beer Revolution has stepped out of the trend box and is giving the Calgary pizza lover a few extra varieties to choose from.  These include, the HIGHLY recommended Armin and the very interesting Maple Syrup prosciutto pizza; and for you picky 'I-only-eat-Dominos' guys, there's the Everyday Normal Guy; which has a bunch of meat on it. There's none of this 'we think we're Italian' stuff; the pizza is North American inspired and uniquely constructed.  The beer menu is projected on large screens airport terminal-like and just like at the terminal, it constantly rotates. Pink is on special and below the blue line is happy hour.  Because the beer selection is in constant rotation, you're always getting something different. A nice change from the Stella/Keiths/Steam Whistle choices at most places. There is, however, a noticeable lack of lagers on the menu...  The pizza here is good, but the other menu choices are not as well thought out. If the chefs put as much love and attention into their other menu items as they did the pizza, Beer Revolution could knock it out of the park.  Beer Revolution is next door to my office, and we usually invite the Armin pizza over for our lunch meetings and because of that, the meetings always go a little long.   T."}
{"text":"Rotating beer menu?  Maple Syrup on a pizza?  I am in love with this place!"}
{"text":"We decided on Beer Revolution to celebrate IPA Day, and they had lots of options to fulfill our hop-head cravings.   On Thursday evenings from 4-6pm, they have a deal called 4 for 4.  4 appys - pretzels, small pizza, ribs and truffle fries were on for $4.  4 different beers as well as a red & white house wine were also on for $4.  We took full advantage of the drink specials, and shared the pretzel appy.  The pretzels were soft, buttery and salty.  The dipping sauce was a tasty mustard aioli.  Yum!  We shared a bunch of different 10x10\" pizzas.  The slices are cut into squares, and all of the topping options are dramatically unique... They aren't attempting to be traditional in any way!  - Hot Wing pizza (Grilled chicken, hot sauce, carrot, celery, mozzarella, gorgonzola, peppercorn ranch) was one of my favorites.  It could have used a bit more chicken, but the hot sauce was flavorful and the gorgonzola wasn't overly pungent.  Blue-cheese haters don't need to be afraid of this one.  - Blackened Saddle (Blackened steak, bacon, banana peppers, white cheddar, mozzarella, crispy onions, cajun remoulade, horseradish aioli, seasoned arugula) was another one of my favorites. It had a tiny amount of heat, and the arugula balanced the richness of the other toppings.  Yum!  - Junior Boy (Prosciutto, grilled pineapple, roasted jalapnos, smoked cheddar, maple syrup, marinara sauce) is a spicy-Hawaiian lovers dream.  If you are sensitive to spice: stay away, because this one has some serious kick if you happen to grab a slice with a few jalepenos!  The maple and pineapple help to balance the kick of heat.  - Newton (Black mission figs, prosciutto, buffalo mozzarella, pecorino, basil, marinara sauce) was really different and great for the sweet & savory lovers at our table.  Definitely a good one to try a slice of.  These pizzas were substantially different than anything I've had in town.  They certainly aren't even close to authentic Italian, but I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE TO WATCH HOCKEY! The sound was so bad it was like really loud static. No one could hear a word the announcer was saying. We asked two staff members what was wrong and they both just said \"sorry it's as loud as it goes, I don't know what's wrong\". I'm confused why the owner even has tv's here. I would have left but when it's playoff time there's no seats left anywhere else so I was trapped here for 3 gruelling hours.   On top of the crappy sound it was also like 28 degrees. I kept having to go to the washroom to soak my face or go stand outside to cool off. I think they do this to try and sell more beer but the beer I ordered wasn't even cold!! My wife also ordered a tiny $21 pizza that was very meh.   I will not be returning to this place ever again. Terrible 1/5 stars"}
{"text":"I love the airport arrival/departure signs that they use to show all the beers on tap for the day. I can't wait to go back to try some of their food. I especially want to check out happy hour (and the deals that go along with it!)."}
{"text":"Starting with the beer, the staff is very knowledgeable about what they offer on a daily basis. I find the best thing to do is let them know what you'd like, what you're favorite regular brew is, or how adventurous you're feeling.  The pizza is a very decent thin crust, but the toppings are non-traditional,... not a bad thing, just different. What's nice is that you can customize to your heart's content, so you're not stuck having maple syrup on your pizza if it's not what you want. One warning, if the roasted jalapenos are good quality on the day you go, trust them when they say they are hot, even for you heat freaks!  Wait staff is attentive, friendly and a pleasure to chat with."}
{"text":"I really like the idea of going somewhere that has many beers on tap, so when I got the chance to go Beer Revolution I was excited! We got there around 7pm on a Saturday and I was happy that there were still many seats available.   Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly which was a nice bonus, especially when you have questions about what to order. I was a bit disappointed however in the selection... I guess I just thought there would be MORE to choose from. We ordered an appy, the pizza spring rolls  - which were very tasty but quite greasy and I felt very unhealthy eating them.  I hear pizza is the way to go here though so i'll have to go back and try a couple slices!   UPDATE!   We came back here for some pizza and pints and let me tell you - the pizza was delicious! we ordered the newton and the cheese pizza, both were so fresh and tasty. I liked how they were square and cut in strips. The pricing was great to, considering all pizza is $5 off on sundays. I will definatly come back!"}
{"text":"Really good beer, but a surprisingly bad hamburger.  I did not realize that it would arrive like a charcoal briquette in a bun. I am not used to that and it could have used a warning label.   The beer and the service were great. My only beef was with the beef."}
{"text":"Great food and a great atmosphere.  Spent some time on the patio on a sunny afternoon and it was a good change from the roof tops your seeing now.  Finally something in this spot on 130th that is worth checking out.  Beer selection is solid with lots of local favorites.  Food was excellent, we had the steak wrap and smoked meat sandwich and were really happy.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I was on a night out with a couple friends and they were showing me some of the best pubs in town, this was the first place we ended up at. It must have been the best pub I been to so far. The airport style monitors with all the beer they had was really interesting. Definitely the place to go if your into different kinds of beer. The food was fantastic as well, they have very good pizza."}
{"text":"This place is great, really good food, friendly staff, nice decor and most importantly amazing selection of beer.  They have screen on the wall with the currently tapped beer and the selection they have changes.  The food is not cheap, but worth the cost.  Definitely try the pizzas.  Great after work place to meet up for beers or watch the game.  Extensive selection of beers and worth going."}
{"text":"So close to 5...  Calgary's foray in craft beer has been disappointing to say the least, but Beer Revolution gives me hope.  A very good beer selection is paramount and this place delivers.  Along with 1/2 glasses for those who want to try a few on the board.  A little pricey considering they are not pint pours but not outrageous.  Service was good, and I give our waitress credit on keeping our glasses full.  She didn't have a clue about beer and that is a shame.  A knowledgeable staff is priceless and could easily have kept us there for a few more hours.  I am not a big fan of short skirts and low cut tops, don't get me wrong I like scantily clad women, there is just a time and place and this shouldn't be that kind of bar.  Ambiance was decent but it was very loud and too many TV's.  I don't mind 1 or 2, but any more and you are a sports bar.  Food was pricey and OK.  Although many things were great for a bite or two, the food was not great as a stand alone dish.  For example, 2 curry wings are interesting and tasty, but at 4 you wish you had ordered something else.  In all it was a great experience considering the alternatives, I just wished they would focus on what was important and not try and be everything to everyone."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Fresh flavors. The tap selection is awesome if you want to sample the best Canada has to offer in one place. Come here. It was refreshing to have a fine selection of western craft breweries.   We were very well taken care of drinking 8oz pours of 8-10 beers. It was a good lunch. I suggest visiting if you need a break from MEC. Cheers."}
{"text":"good place. Not a fancy bar but a casual place with good happy hour every day. Good beer selection. Try pretzels on Tuesday for $ 2"}
{"text":"Drinks: 3.5/5 Food: 3.5/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Overall experience: 4/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  If you are looking for a place to hang out with your friends while sipping a few brewskies, then check out Beer Revolution! I've been here a few times and I'm definitely hooked.  The highlight of this place is that they continuously change their beer list which is displayed on flatscreen tvs. The screens also include information such as: Alcohol %, the brewery the beer came from, when the beer was tapped and how long it will be on tap for, and the amount left on tap.   They usually have about 24 varieties of craft beer - ales, stouts, porters, lagers; and about 8 different kinds of bottled beers (including gluten free)! They have 8oz samples ($3.00-$4.00) which is ideal if you want to try a variety of beers; 16oz ($7-$8); and selected varieties for 12oz ($8). They keep popular varieties on tap all the time like the \"Peach Fuzz Wheat Ale\" which has a refreshingly light peach flavour with a peach to garnish.  When it's really busy, service can be extremely slow. However most of the servers seemed knowledgeable about the beer and answered any questions you had. The bar itself is not too big with tables and bankets set up along the sides. The decor is nothing to rave about, just very modern with different shades of grey/black.   And what goes great with beer? Pizza of course! They serve up tantalizing 10 inch gourmet thin crust  pizzas ($15-$19/each). I haven't had the chance to try their pizzas, but they have some pretty unique combinations like their \"Junior Boy\" (prosciutto, grilled pineapple,  roasted jalapenos, smoked cheddar, maple syrup, and marina sauce); and \"Blazing Saddle\" (blackened steak, bacon, peppers, white cheddar, mozzarella, onions, cajun remoulade, horseradish aioli).   They also put a spin on your typical bar snacks like curry wings ($12), bavarian pretzels ($9), and truffle fries with sea salt, cracked black pepper and white truffle aioli ($8). I tried their nachos which are enormous and full of veggies (great for sharing); and their truffle fries which comes in one of those metal cone molds. $8 is a little steep... but when you have the munchies it's a great snack to share! The dish consists of crispy thick cuts of yam fries and thin potato fries with a tasty lemony aioli.   Their one and only dessert, the \"Revolution Ice Cream Sandwhich\" is a yummy gourmet 'blast from the past'. I usually don't each ice cream sandwiches, but this is one of my favs. You have two thick chocolate chip cookies sandwiched between an espresso gelato with chocolate flakes, and peppermint whipped cream on the side. The cookies weren't overly sweet or greasy and paired perfectly with the gelato. The chocolate flakes in the ice cream added that extra 'touch'. I hate peppermint in my desserts but the whipped cream had a delicate flavour that worked well with the rest of the dish. Really messy and hard to eat, but tasted fantastic with a beer on the side! The only downside is that the cookies are a hit and miss... sometimes they come out hard and a bit stale or nice and soft.  Overall, check this place out if you're tired of your 'regular' bar and want some good food and beer!  Tidbit: They have a 4 for 4 @4  special (Mon-Sat)  where from 4pm-6pm they have 4 select beers/snacks for $4. You have a choice between a small 6 inch pizza, truffle fries, ribs, or bavarian pretzels. Amazing deal! They also have fantastic daily specials that makes me wish I lived closer to it!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed visiting this place recently. Right away I was very pleased to find that the atmosphere is laid back and casual, as a true craft beer venue should be. The decor and menu graphics are pretty modern and interesting.  The LCD beer ticker says it all! It provides all the information you might need in terms of what is available, where it's from, when it was tapped, and if it's on special. They can be found throughout the venue and are a beautifully essential tool to the craft beer enthusiast who doesn't want to hamper their server with questions.  Food is relatively pricey for a pub, but well worth it in my opinion; bringing quality ingredients and, more importantly, originality where you might not expect it. The pizza spring rolls are one of a kind and truly a must-have (hint; they are deep fried in a  sort of phyllo dough rather than conventional batter).  The chicken wing pizza is an eye opener and was delicious with a few good IPAs to choose from.  Our server was unable to provide us with details regarding the beer. For some of the more inexperienced craft drinkers, this can be a little disheartening. For the experienced ones, the screen is all you need.  However, it is a little strange when your server tells you \"she doesn't drink beer\".. at a place such as Beer Revolution.  Not a deal breaker.  My one main gripe.. they charge pint prices, and call their glass sizes pints. They are NOT true 568mL Imperial pints as expected in Canada, but are instead US pints at 473mL. I realize this might be nit picking, but there are other venues in the city serving craft beer in proper sizes with identical pricing. That is what keeps this place from being 5 stars, as it can become a fairly costly drinking experience.  All things aside, I really enjoyed this place and will be going back for the sheer selection and good service."}
{"text":"Good service and great atmosphere, a wide selection of beers. I didn't order any food, so I can't speak to that, but I have nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar before 4:00 and the bartender was awesome Answered all of my questions, gave the wifi password, sold me on some tasty beer!! Also the staff seemed to really get along with each other which is nice to see. Makes for a great environment to sit and watch some CFL action on    Also, the gluten free pizza crust is very good!!"}
{"text":"Always changing the beer menu to new beer. It's a great way to bring people back who LOVE beer!! Also, the pizzas are amazing!!! A little expensive for the food but it's good"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVE LOVE LOVE Beer Revolution. Their beer selection is usually pretty good if you like craft beer (you know, beer with taste, as opposed to the generic, watery, popular brands like Kokanee and Keiths) and their food is quite good as well.  We usually go for the 4 for $5 between 4-6.  The pretzels are AMAZING. The beer ribs are also delicious, and contrary to a couple of the other reviews, I think the pizza is quite good.   As with any restaurant, there are good servers and there are bad servers. We've lucked out, we usually have a server than is friendly and fast.  There have been a couple of times though where we have been sitting with empty glasses for awhile, even though it wasn't busy. But this happens everywhere people, literally everywhere. I served for 6 years, so it does grind my gears when we get a server that is less than par, but the food and beer does make up for it!  Definitely give it a try for yourselves!"}
{"text":"Great place! Laid back, good beer selection (if you're into that sort of thing), and they have a cheese platter on the appy menu!! I was also a fan of the candles on the tables. The only reason I'm not giving a five star is because the decor/vibe of the place is no different than any other pub in Calgary. I'm still on the hunt for something with a little more personality..."}
{"text":"Beer Revolution is a great place to go every now and then for a little beer adventure. They have an airport-style board that displays what beers they have on feature, and the list is ever changing.   Though I have never had the food here, the beers are always interesting.  One complaint I have is that the service is quite slow, and sometimes if we go in a group, you can never be sure that you get the beer you ordered. For example, two of my friends ordered the same beer, but they were given notably different beverages. Or, when I ordered the same beer twice, I received two different beers. So two stars were lost here based on service."}
{"text":"Good beer and decent prices. Don't go here expecting to get the regular on tap beer you find at Boston Pizza etc. Mostly microbrews that require a waitresses help picking what you would like.  Had a pizza, decent size for the price. Only we had the gluten free and it wasnt very good, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Fresh Beer Alert!!!  What's on tap at Beer Revolution? Who knows! As much as I love Calgary's local brewers, If I've got a chance to drink a beer I've never tried before, I will always choose it. Beer Revolution's taps change so frequently, they need an airport style flight tracker to keep on top of the new arrivals. Seriously - they have one! TVs are posted around the establishment, but you won't find the same sports on every single one of them, oh no - they're a live tracker of what beer they've currently got on tap.  Staring from your table at a beer menu that is located just above another table's heads is a great way to make friends or get into fights. Trying to find a new beer to try, I received a stern \"Um, can I help you?!\" from one guy who thought I was staring relentlessly at him for several minutes. His reaction was pretty fair, I make a pretty intense face when I'm making an intense decision about what beer to order next. I wish I could tell you that the situation escalated into a a full scale kung fu fight complete with ninjas coming out of nowhere and the chef emerging from the kitchen as a boss that I needed to pass to make it to the next level... But I just pointed to the beer menu above his head. We both laughed and he felt silly.  Beer Revolution is what you may call a Gastropub, since along with a crazy fresh and interesting beer selection, they've taken their own spin on pub classics to bring you a sohle new experience. At its core, it's beer and pizza and it really doesn't get any better than that.  I however, will not be calling this place a \"gastropub.\" Sure, it qualifies, but I just hate that name so much. Why would places with such tasty food have such a disgusting sounding restaurant designation. Do a quick search on Urban Dictionary for \"Gastro\" to see how the rest of the world views this. Do it after I tell you about the food though because I want you to have an appetite for this. (Note: It will not be SFW.)  Come here hungry, because their brick-baked pizzas are innovative and varied enough to pair with any beer. I love the Wilbur because I love Charlottes Web and this pizza has tasty pork. Don't get me wrong I LOVE Wilbur in that book and to think that that poor creature who captivated the imagination of millions of children would have to die just so I could have this pizza is heartbreaking. But after trying this pizza... it's a decision I'm willing to make.  Also - Pizza spring rolls. Enough said."}
{"text":"Last night, we headed over for pizza and beer. I was really impressed with the beer - I sampled the watermelon fruit beer. Lovely - I would gladly switch from my beloved Grasshopper/Mill Street/Hoegarden for this anytime. Not sure how long Beer Revolution will serve it as its a seasonal beer. Pizza was good bar food. I enjoyed the fact the vegetables were still slightly crisp and clearly fresh. Nice light crust. Fun patio to occupy."}
{"text":"Maybe lesser known than Craft and Wurst for beer, but just as good if not better. The food was surprisingly interesting and good! The curry chicken wings are awesome. The beer selection is good, and the staff were more than helpful. We were able to make a reservation for 15+ with ease. The only downside of BR may be the lack of a patio in the summer. Otherwise you can expect me back to warm up with beer during the winter!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Love how unpretentious it is. We always sit at the bar, the bartenders are all great. Awesome changing selection of beers, and a really good menu considering it's a pub.(even the pizza!)"}
{"text":"Beer Rev is basically the commercialized version of a lovely but very pretentious bar i love in Toronto called the Only (which I may also have reviewed). They have rotating taps after every keg, meaning if they tap xyz winter ale and it's finished, the next at bat will not be the same keg and i love that. They display their plethora of brews (both on tap and bottled) on screens throughout the pub which are updated right as taps empty and clearly state prices for pint, 1/2 pint, ABV, brewing location, the works. It's just awesome.   We had grand service (sometimes tough as women in sports bars, which this had turned into for the night for the Flames game) and really enjoyed taking advantage of the happy hour specials (3-6 pm, 4 brews and a handful of delicious finger foods for $5). I love that the happy hour specials are clearly priced and explained, with the happy hour beers highlighted on the screens in green. I know that sounds like a silly thing to be stoked about, but it really is not all that common and I do really appreciate that.  Actually let me take a break from this vague old review and tell you what we got: Father John's Winter Ale (happy hour special, yummy) and Evil Twin's Yang Daiji DIPA (not a special but we had to try it, a 10% double IPA, extremely floral and hoppy but not douchey, if you know what I mean).   For food we got 3 happy hour specials -   the ribs (yum, apple and beer flavored),   pizza special (two slices of thin crust with italian sausage, fennel, spinache, and something delicious which was probably crack)  truffle fries (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  okay kids. I know it's just chips. I know. but let me tell you why these fries are great. I'm not one to go mad for anything with the world 'truffle' in it, but these are FRESH fries, seasoned with rock salt (mmm), and get this... it's sweet potato AND regular fries. mixed.   \"Oh Ayla that's great but whats the big deal you can just buy both kinds and mix them\"  GREAT POINT, INTERNET STRANGER. the real pull here, is they, by the grace of god, did NOT SERVE THEIR SWEET POTATO FRIES WITH DING DANG CHIPOTLE MAYO  Now let me clarify - I love chipotle mayo, its delightful stuff. but I have been waiting patiently for 6 years since the C-mayo has become the popular kid, I have been waiting for a place to show me ANOTHER condiment to eat yam chips with. And Beer Rev did it. garlicky, sweet, truffly aioli. Holy (or should i say, Haioooli) COW. yummy. just great.   Anyway TL;DR: great beer, clear prices, yummy food, sweet staff, easy location. why aren't you there now? Why am I not there now? we both should be."}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious beer and the food is awesome. I think they made a smart move with having less beer but making regular changes, and having a smaller but yummy food menu. Craft, you could learn some things from this place!"}
{"text":"May 17th, 2018 I returned for the 2nd time after having first attended during their dry run now I went after officially being opened. The first time I gave them 5 stars. After this experience they get 2 stars. It was wing night and the wings were really good. It is 45 cents a wing so for 10 it is 4.50 and house rules apply. The flavours are really good. I got cajun and tick curry and I would highly recommend the curry. I have never tasted anything like it on a wing for flavour before.  We also went because it was the third game in Stanley Cup playoffs with Winnipeg and Vegas and the TVs are always glutting - they had a really bad connection or something.  I also got these shitismu peppers which were $13 for fried peppers with a little bit of cheese- not worth it.  As well, everything on the menu just seems really expensive which I didn't notice before such as they have house links (being two hot dogs basically) for $24 and there pizzas are also really expensive.   May 12th, 2018 Beer Revolution now has a new location in the suburbs on 130th avenue in Calgary so that you don't have to go to 8th street to be here.  Even though opening day is officially today (Thursday May 16th) I have already been here a couple times because on Friday May 11th they had their sneak a peek and the from the 12 of may to the 15th of may they have had their dry runs. I am going tonight as well to sit on the patio and I can't wait.  So far every time I have gone it has been great and good food!  Wednesdays is wing night with 45 cent wings and you need to order at least ten.  The following is their philosophy or I should say philosophies that they believe in:   Premium Beer, Addictive Pizza and Rock & Roll  THE BEER 24 taps that change on a regular basis, as in several times per day. Real time, dynamic, digital beer boards convey the current list and applicable information related to each beer. We're pouring anything that's delicious but we're steering clear of the mainstream.  THE FOOD Innovative and unpretentious, Beer Revolution pizzas are made with Italy's best 00 flour, San Marzano tomatoes and premium meat and cheese. Our pizzas are rolled thin and brick baked at 700 degrees.  THE MUSIC Rock and Roll of all generations. From the Rolling Stones to Kings of Leon, Beer Revolution is the place to hear rock's best hits. Tweet us with any song requests and we'll be sure to add them to the rotation.  TRUEPOUR Truepour is Beer Revolution's uncompromised commitment to beer quality. We are committed to only serving beer from meticulously sterilized beer lines. Beer Revolution beer lines are short, always clean and our beer is always fresh. Anything less would be unacceptable."}
{"text":"REVELRY AND REVOLUTION!  I was taking a long exploratory walk through various parts of Calgary, when the Beer Revolution sign caught my attention. I immediately remembered my good times at Oakland's Beer Revolution and decided to to seek my \"40 Ounces of Freedom\" here in Cow Town.   Actually, Calgary's Beer Revolution is a little more scrubbed that the funkier Oakland version. My receipt at the end also mentioned the local Brewsters chain. Oh well, the Calgary Revolution has co-opted by The Man. No \"Up Against the Wall Redneck Mother...\" here!  Nonetheless, this Beer Revolution is a really nice place. I especially enjoyed the dark woods, the neighbourhood bar feel, nicely spaced and comfortable tables and booths, very good service, and watching sports (mostly CFL, MLB, and Premier League) on the many large TV screens. I should have had the pizza, but instead enjoyed a very tasty order of Truffle Fries. The various draft and bottle beers were electronically displayed and my choice of the Hop Burn High Double IPA was spot on.    In Heaven There is No Beer, That's Why I'll Drink it Here (Again)....."}
{"text":"A good spot for a few beers and wings.  The beer menu is displayed on screens around the restaurant which also discloses remaining stock and expected \"departure\". The hot wings were excellent - spicy but not goopy. The pizza was OK; the crust was a little crunchy for my tastes."}
{"text":"These guys have a private room in the back for groups which is a welcome addition when you are meeting dozens of people and a typical pub is just too loud!   I love the beer menu on the wall that looks like arrival and departures at the airport....  the prices are where the times would go :)   The food menu reminds me a bit of Craft (which is a good thing) but the beer selection is smaller.  No caring about beer ... I'm quite taken by the mixed drinks and the belini in particular which is not too sweet and keeps the wine taste I prefer.  In fear of being stuck with nachos in a pub I ate before coming but ended up nibbling and then ordering more food which mostly came home as left overs.  Pizza is great as are the pretzels.   Lesson learned for next time - have dinner at Beer Revolution!   Overall it seems to a hoping place, service is good and I\"m thankful that someone else has been arranging group meetings so I never have had to wait for a table here."}
{"text":"One of the largest beer selections around in a nice and friendly atmosphere.  Beer Revolution definitely has a large beer selection with lots of great deals. Their food is also very delicious and worth checking out even if you aren't a large beer fan. Whether it's lunch or dinner I think you'd have a hard time ordering a bad meal here. When I was there the place was packed with people but I still received great service from my waitress. It can get quite loud in there though once it fills up. My one complaint about Beer Revolution is how many beer screens they have up. You don't need to see the beer menu on every square inch of the place.  Great place to pop by for a beer or a meal."}
{"text":"Generally disappointing...... And I have given them several chances.   I have tried several different menu items and all of them are meh. The pizzas are bland and I can honestly say that this is the only place that I have ever had to add salt and pepper to a pizza so that it tasted like something more than cardboard. The service is not usually very good for me but I notice that the waitresses are a lot more attentive to the groups of professional men that come in.    Due to the proximity to my office I know that I will return but that is the only thing that would bring me back."}
{"text":"Tried beer revolution for the first time last night, I was impressed with the nachos they were very good ! We had a junior boy pizza which my first thought was it was a little greasy but their was syrup on it. I would defiantly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is a place for beer lovers, hands down.  Multiple beers on tap I've never heard of, and they change on a regular basis. Great idea that keeps you trying new beers each time. They have screens that show the brewery, beer name, alcohol content and price. Blurry picture, but gives you an idea what I mean.   The food is okay. Not really worth the cost (It's pricey)  Had good service each time I've been here. Never had a problem.  I'm a rum drinker normally, but 15 beers in, I'm an everything drinker."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome beer bistro.   They have Rogue Dead Guy on tap, which is worth 5 stars in itself, but found that everyone but us was getting VIP treatment. The 2 'seen better days' women sitting beside us at the bar were treated to free shooters, as did the two women in the other side of us (one of them used to work there). It felt as if we were the only ones without special treatment. Otherwise, service was pretty good (Andre is great), food was great, beer was the best part.   If we were regulars, we might get amazing service, but we will be back to find out..."}
{"text":"The new addition to 130th where Chili's used to be. I never visited the Chilis but it looks like they have done a really nice reno and spruced up the outside of the building. We went for wing night but apparently, Monday is just wing night at the downtown location... whoops! Hope they update the menu soon to reflect that. We ended up sharing a Sayulita pizza instead, their pizza menu looked pretty creative and it was a pretty good taco inspired pizza. The service was a bit slow for a Monday evening and the different days for specials is disappointing as otherwise the menu items are a bit pricey in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've wanted to check these guys out for a long time and I finally did. It was solely because they brought in Belching Beaver.   I've had the Peanut Butter Milk Stout before on my many trips to San Diego and I was excited to try the rest of the lineup. They were all delicious. Also as a bonus they had a Tool Shed cask going which was also tasty in my mouth.  These guys have a great pizza menu plus they were participating in YYC Pizza Week so I went with their entry for the competition. The pizza was excellent. The honey mixed with the cooked lemon slices was surprisingly awesome.  Our server was right on top of things all night too. So great job there.  My only complaint about this place is that they don't do flights. With so many different beers on tap it's hard to try a good variety when you can only go as small as a half pint. So either you have to be prepared to drink or come back often. Oh I see what you're doing there Beer Revolution..."}
{"text":"This old Brewster's location rebranded itself and reopened as Beer Revolution. Aside from a very small note on the bill, they've really separated themselves from their lineage, though. It's kind of the younger, trendier cousin of Brewster's, with better specials and better beer if you do not feel like drinking their in house stuff.   Visiting during happy hour (4-6 daily) will make you pretty happy - several kinds of beer at $4 a pop, great food deals (the pretzels and fries are fresh and great, skip the ribs) and the beer is not the usual swill.   Love the rotating TV menu of beer - makes it easy to scope out what you want without getting lost in the menu or being told \"we're out of that.\" It's unpretentious, casual and has a lot of booth and bar space to spread out in, depending on what you are into.   Pretty smart of Brewster's to get on trend and start selling other beer on tap. Kudos."}
{"text":"My review is more from 3-6pm on a Saturday so I can't really speak for the service when it's busy. The focus of this place is craft beer, pizza, and a handful of signature appetizers. Beer selection is good (of course) and features mostly temporary selections, with a few permanent house beers. A small selection of cocktails and wine are available for those who dislike beer. The sandwich selection is very small and there is only one burger. Salad selection is decent. The snacks were all excellent. The fries were both sweet potato and regular, with amazing truffle aoli sauce. The pretzels were good as well, with some sort of sauce I don't know the name of, but it was spicy with a definite onion taste. The ribs were good too, but you don't get very much for the price.  For pizza we had the Thai (special) and the Blazing Saddle (I think that was the name). Both were excellent. The Thai tasted better than most Thai food I have had. The Blazing Saddle was complex and tasty.  Service was very good. The waitress was friendly and generally fast. Everything seemed clean. Noise level was loud considering the time and number of people. It is basically brick and concrete so there is no noise isolation and it is echoes a lot. Music was fairly loud as well. They are going for a more upbeat experience so I won't hold it against them. Probably the weakest aspect is the value for money. It isn't really expensive when looking at prices, but the beer sizes are 25% smaller (16oz or 8oz instead of 20oz or 12oz) and the appetizers are fairly small for a bar. I would recommend it for a small meal and some good beer with friends or coworkers. Spending the whole night here would break the bank for most."}
{"text":"I happened to stumble upon this place on St. Patty's Day. Surprisingly it was a controlled area. Not too busy and great enough to relax in. They display their wide variety of beers and the percentage on a screen from various areas and angles in the restaurant, which really helps. The server was checking up on a regular basis, which is always a bonus, so that your glass is always full.  As for the food, I ordered the nachos and boy, was it a big dish to consume. I didn't even expect that at all but it's totally worth it. They give you about 3 different dips to go with it as well which makes it even better. The pizza was good. The beer selection is great. The service was great. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Last month, My boyfriend took me to BEER REVOLUTION PIZZA AND BEER for dinner. It's a brand new location on 130 Ave SE Calgary. We arrived the restaurant around 5 pm. It was not busy at all. We quickly found the table and sat down. The server brought the menu and drinks to us. The server is a nice young lady. She was very friendly and helpful. She gave us a great suggestion to order the food. We had the Premium Beer and Truffle Fries to start. The Beer was OK. The Truffle Fries was tasted awesome. The normal fries combined yam fries with Sea salt, cracked black pepper and truffle aioli. OMG. They are so tasty. I couldnt believe it. We also ordered our own dish as well. I had LAMB MERGUEZ $17 ( With Cranberry relish, aujs and beer mustard, one link on a bun with fries or house salad)  and My boyfriend ordered NORMAL GUY SUB $15  ( Salami, Pepperoni, Marinara Sauce, Mozzarell, Green Peppers and Red onions with Sweet & Hot Mustard ). I was super surprised that my Lamb dish was like hot dog, but the taste was OK. I more enjoyed my house green salad. Normal Guy Sub was a little bit disappointed. Nothing special about it. The taste was like pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Calgary.  Nice cold craft beer with lots of choices.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Good place for beers and food. They have 24 tap beers that change on a regular basis and also daily deals. There is a nice atmosphere with good music. My friends had pizza and were happy with their choice. Service was good."}
{"text":"Great beer variety, great service, and great location.  The beer menus is on the wall in the form of a arrival/departure flight info board :) Kind of cute!"}
{"text":"Good option for late night eats in this part of Calgary.  Staff wasn't as informed about the beer selection as I'd expect at this kind of place but the flatbread-style pizza was very good and the beer plentiful and fresh."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good pizza. I am sure its related to Brewster next door. I saw our server push the door to Brewster.   So I got the Junior Boy - lunch size. Well the lunch size was just right. I got it without the jalapeno. It tasted somewhat like a Hawaiian pizza. I was told this is one of the most popular pizza on the menu. I was able to taste the maple syrup. Not too sweet. Just about right. The crust was a bit hard or chewy. It was ok.   Overall, I liked it. The pizza for the lunch size is $15. Not sure if this is a good deal or not. Maybe a better deal to go with the regular size. For a few bucks more it seems like double the size and also you get more toppings and less crust.   D√©cor is ok. I like how they have the feature beer on a screen."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection, love the board of beers with tap information, but the service was disappointing.    The server we had looked bored, occasionally came to our table, but worked her regulars that were not in her section.  Needless to say, our service suffered and our beer was neglected.  The last time I saw so many empty glasses staring at me was when I unloaded my damn dishwasher ... first time there, not sure about a return visit."}
{"text":"C'est la revolution de biere! Actually it isn't, that's just bad translation on my part. But it is a new way of doing beer. Beer Revolution is serving up a variety of different craft beers. They're all listed on a digital screen, kind of like the departures and arrivals screens at the airport. They also keep the website updated with a list, including when the keg was tapped and the estimated time before it runs out.  When I got there, the place was full, but they took my name and phone number at the door and sent me over to Brewsters for a drink while I waited. It didn't take long for a table to be ready, I had to guzzle my blueberry beer a bit, since you can't take it over with you.  Food wise, pizza, appys, sandwiches and a couple of salads are what you can expect. The pizza toppings rocked, the flat crust gets a 3.5 star rating. Also enjoyable, the pizza spring rolls.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is my favourite kick back spot to grab a bite and a brew in Calgary. The great beer selection is constantly revolving (the \"revolution\", perhaps?) hour by hour, day to day. The pizza is INSANELY delicious- concoctions of the Gods, truly. & I am pretty sure the best Ceasar in Calgary is served here! Service is fantastic, and if you have any questions on beer don't be shy- the staff will make sure you leave happy!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Will definitely come back and I don't even drink alcohol. We ordered 3 kinds of pizzas and loved them all. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I like the beer selection, but the service is often slow. While the food and atmosphere are both decent, neither have any personality.   It's a clean, standard bar, but not especially interesting in any way. I come back when others want to meet there!"}
{"text":"Pizza was only OK.  Crust hard/Brittle.  Expensive for what it is. Service slow.  Seems not enough staff for lunch."}
{"text":"Given the drudgery of beer places in Calgary, I can't imagine anywhere better to go. If I were to compare Beer Revolution to numerous places in Portland, Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, and the like, it would difficult to rate it above a 3 star, but in the Calgary area this is my go to place. There are a lot of drinking establishments and pure beer places in the general vicinity but I'll always choose Beer Revolution as a place to start and more often than not I'll end my night here. fff Your first choice upon entering is to sit at the bar or a table. If you're in a group of 4 or less, spread out at the bar. The first time I came, I sat at a table and the waitress, although efficient, knew not about beer. Lately, I came here three nights in a row and sat at the bar. The bartenders introduced themselves, were very knowledgeable about the taps they were serving, were jovial, extremely quick, and were not afraid to recommend food or drinks. The first night I walked in, I had sat, opened a tab, and had my first beer in front of me in about 15 seconds and every time my beer got low, they were right there making sure I had another one coming.  So the service is great, but what about the beer? They have 24 taps and generally all micro or craft brews. Three taps are their own beers, the rest constantly rotate. They also have 4-5 bottles available at a time, presumably things they can't get on tap. At any given time, there are a few outstanding beers I'd be happy to drink all night long and I wouldn't be unhappy to try anything on the menu. They also offer halves for (generally) half the price of a full so you could try out a large amount of beers before settling on your favorite. Prices are a bit high, $6-$8 for generally 10 or 12 oz drinks, but seeing as I'd be paying the same amount for a pint of macro beer elsewhere, I'm okay with that.  The food is above average pub food, but not spectacular. I've had quite a bit off their menu and have never been disappointed. Probably because I don't expect to be blown away by food in a beer bar.  A few additional things that really have me excited about this place is that they have a live updated beer list on TVs (and online), they do monthly beer events, and a weekly cask every Friday night. Their online beer menu is great because you can check their beer list before coming. During my last three night foray; on the first night, I tried a wonderful De Molen Vuur & Vlam IPA that I had never seen anywhere else. It was such a nice beer, that on the following two nights, I checked whether or not it was still on tap and didn't even consider going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. I had the brewster peach ale and the st. Ambrose black IPA. Their revolution burger was excellent. Bartender Brett was very nice and responsive. Didn't really give me much help in selecting beer but affirmation my affection for the black IPA I had. Overall a great litte brew pub with an impressive selection of beers frome all of North America and even Norway (N√∏gne √ò)"}
{"text":"Beer revolution has so many unique beers and delicious pizzas! I had the pleasure of trying the \"junior boy\" and wow was it delicious. The maple syrup does a number on you. The pizza offers both sweet and savory and if you ask for a side of Parmesan cheese, it takes it to the next level. On Sundays they even have 5 dollars off of pizza! We also had the nachos which again, were really good. Definitely a little more on the oily side, but it did look healthy. That's what counts right? Haha. This place is a little on the small side for a pub though, but you can always pub hop!"}
{"text":"I went last night on Day 6 of being open and the place was pretty busy.  We got there just before 6pm which is fantastic if you like saving money.  Luckily I do, and we were able to sneak our drinks in just before happy hour ended.  $4 beers after a long work week just taste that much sweeter right?  Unfortunately, once we found out about their $4 snacks (these run during happy hour along with their beer specials, Monday-Saturday 4-6pm) it was after 6pm.  Nevertheless, we ordered the Bavarian Pretzels which I found out are shipped in from Canada's Bavarian hotspot (?)....Ontario.  Regardless of where these things are from, they are redonkulously good.  Regular price is $9 and you get 3 soft pretzels served with this amazing mustard aioli.  I think there is some dill in there, but they wouldn't reveal their recipe to me so I had to order them again to be sure.  I love beer, but it doesn't seem to love me, so I investigated their wine list, which is sparse but ok in a pinch.  My co-worker had the Merlot (don't do it) and I had an Argentinian Malbec (better) but one of the people that stopped by to check on the quality of our experience indicated that he'd like to change up the wine list once they sort out the kinks and get their bearings.  He's also a sommelier AND he was cute so he earned some trust points...let's see if it happens.  The pizzas on the menu looked mighty tempting, but they are in the $17 range so I hope they can hold a candle to the heroin pizza they sell over at Una.  For being open only six days, Beer Revolution seems poised to be a solid post-work option.  Try not to be too disappointed if they're sold out of pretzels, I plan on going back and consuming mass quantities of them between 4-6pm daily.  10/30"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best thin crust Pizza in town! 27 rotating craft beer taps are a win!!"}
{"text":"Awesome brewpub and pizzeria. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is our waitress was not very attentive. Pizza was great and beer was excellent. Cool decor with electronic beer menus on the walls."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and beer! Super accommodating of dietary restrictions, they were happy to make me a flatbread (pizza with no cheese) and just added extra toppings, it was divine. Nice atmosphere and friendly and professional staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Yam fries are out of this world here! So good! Pizza is pretty tasty from here too. Has a nice atmosphere and a constantly revolving beer menu which is a great way to try something out of the box."}
{"text":"My second trip was HORRIBLE! I was told by the waitress that they charge for condiments. Service came with an attitude and after waiting around for some time I got up to get the bills and to-go boxes. After my table paid for their meals, the waitress informed a member of my party that if you don't tip, the staff will \"do something\" to the food.   This was not only unprofessional but out-of-turn as we did tip her. We all overhead this and I mentioned to her that we did tip. She informed me that one member of my party did not. Well the rest of us did which more than compensated her for her terrible customer service.  I certainly do not wish to frequent an establishment that defiles your food when your don't tip well for bad service. Good tips are for good service, you are already being paid to do your job!"}
{"text":"The food and beer here is fantastic, as to be expected from a brewery. There are numerous TVs showing the beers available, indicating when the keg was tapped and roughly how much is left, along with a brief description of the beer. It makes for easy selection of what beers you want to try. The only issue may be deciding which ones to try and which to leave out.  The pizzas are amazing, but the highlight for me was the pizza spring roll. Essentially pepperoni and marinara sauce deep fried in spring roll pastry. Beyond delicious!  The only downside to this place is the noise. It is very loud! My son, even with noise cancelling headphones found it overwhelming, and my wife and I found it hard to talk across the table to each other."}
{"text":"Had a little time and needed a beer. Being a Monday, I arrived to find the place rather empty. But I looked around and noticed those who were seated seemed to be enjoying themselves and the bartender made immediate eye contact.  I saddled up to the bar and was greeted with a smile. My attention was directed to the digital menu boards scattered amongst the TVs. To my delight, the beer menu came with more details than I have ever seen. I wasn't looking for details on the flavours I'll find in the beer. Anyone could recite that. But what really came as a surprise was the date that each keg was tapped. Typically it's been my experience that information like that is never divulged. Who wants to drink from an old keg? I'll pass thanks. This transparency sits very high on the list for me. I've been to plenty of beer centric joints where they tell you where the beer is from and publish the tasting notes from the brewery, but ask the server when the keg was tapped and you'll get a look similar to that of asking a first date what their weight is...  The man behind the bar is competent in his duties. He's also confident in them as well. I ask for suggestions, and he turned it back to me. He asked what I like and dislike, and then made recommendations based on that. He didn't default to the go to beers, he made actual recommendations based on what I said. He told me what was on special, offered tasters and followed up to make sure I was happy.  I know many people will expect some of this as standard service, but one guy behind the bar, in a now filling space has a lot to do.  I knew that I needed something to go with my beer, and he was quick to offer a menu, which was small but still offered a good range of selection. Being as I didn't have long and wasn't all that hungry, I ordered the BBQ beer ribs. That was the right choice! A board loaded with sticky, hot, meaty ribs quickly materialized before me. Presentation as alright, nothing to rave about. But when I bit into that first rib, I was in heaven. While the beer was not specifically pronounced in the sauce, it was present and really provided an extra layer of flavour to what was still a pretty good sauce! I was also happy to find that there was more meat than bone. Something that I find is hard to find... Overall: Atmosphere- 4/5 - little loud if you want to have a real conversation around a table but not out of control Food offerings and quality 4/5 - smaller menu, but a little something for most people Beverage menu 5/5 - this is solely based on the beer menu, but the place is called Beer Revolution, and they do offer a good selection from across the country and around the world. Just don't go in for a Bud Light Lime, you may get asked to leave. They'll offer a suggestion though! Service 5/5 - these guys know what they're doing and do it well. They read their guests and adapt to meet their mood/disposition  Go again? 5/5 - I don't live in Calgary, but I'll be coming back next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Bar none the worst service I have ever had.  Our waitress Alexandra was confrontational argumentative and downright rude. She had no knowledge of the beer and when questioned whether the correct one was brought to the table was very rude and confrontational.  It appears the staff there are more interested in socializing with each other than doing their jobs  The food we had was good. .... When we paid the bill she said sorry the wrong beer ruined your night...I explained it wasn't the beer it was her attitude and she told me it was mine.  Will NEVER see any of my money again."}
{"text":"I like beer, am all for a peasant revolt and you kinda had me at the fact you sold pizza. Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, PIZZA! I think I was a Ninja Turtle in another life.  I headed here on a Thursday night at 7 pm and it was still PACKED with the after work crowd. They have really killer happy hour specials here, where they have a menu of everything for $4 so it's no surprise people were still around.  Their beer philosophy is very cool, they have constantly rotating taps, so each time you come back it will be a new menu. I tried a green apple pilsner, that tasted like a liquid version of those green apple caramel lollipops you get at Halloween. Then I went to less wacky beer selections and enjoyed them all.  We went kind of mad on the pizza ordering, getting 3 pizzas for 3 people. They do a thin crust flatbread style pizza here, cut into rectangle slices. We nommed down an Alice, Furious Pete and Newton pizza. We also ordered some truffle fries (they were alright). The shaker of crushed chilis they bring looks more like chili powder, but it still packs a punch, so don't shake too heavily.  The service was only ok, we had to take an uncleared table to get a spot, after 5 minutes the server came by to clear it, and promised to wipe it down, which never happened, but I like dirty sleeves. I think the addition of the busy atmosphere made getting beers a slow process. It's quite expensive here too if you are not getting in for happy hour.  But overall, I enjoyed the selection and \"philosophy\" of beer revolution, but when this place is packed it is LOUD. Sit tight folks. I will be back for more pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza."}
