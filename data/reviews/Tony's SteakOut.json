{"text":"Do not waste your time to ordering from here. It is not professionally run. Read the reviews on Google. There score was a 2 then they must have started writing their own reviews, too many 5s for this bad of service. The only reason I gave them a 1 is because 0 is not an option."}

{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been checking around charlotte for an authentic philadelphia cheesesteak and hoagie place and this has been the best by far. 

My girlfriend said The PIT bbq/buffalo wings were phenomenal! sweet and spicy (hot off the grill!) 

The homemade \"real potato\" french fries were excellent. 

This place is owned by a native Philly family with that philly \"SOUL\" flowing through their veins. Their cheesesteaks and hoagies come on 8in and 12in rolls which I really appreciate because some of the other chains only sell 6in. The have Cheesesteaks, Burgers, Hoagies, Wraps Buffalo Wings, PIT Wings, Fries and Salads. 

I had the Philly Cheesesteak and it was \"the real thing\". The roll was soft and buttery filled with a big portion of meat that was hot and fresh. 

This is the place to get a northern style true-sized cheesesteak or hoagie with all the trimmings and some great buffalo wings!"}
