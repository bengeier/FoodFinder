{"text":"If I could give this 0 stars I would. I ordered delivery and it took 2 hours to get!!!! When we realized how long it had been we tried calling MULTIPLE times and the phone was off the hook. We had already paid with our credit card and couldn't even get in contact with them to cancel our order. Finally after two hours we get our food- cold and soggy. The bun of the burger was completely flattened and soggy and the lettuce tomato and onion were also wilted and soggy. Truly will never give this place business again and I would not recommend anyone to order from here as well.  Update: finally got in contact with the manager. Alaina was extremely apologetic and helpful by giving us a refund. Am not able to say how the food is because we did not eat it."}
{"text":"Great prices, great menu, great service! The food is made with care and it really shows. The service was fast and our server was really attentive. This place is a hidden gem, for sure. My husband and I will definitely return the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Stopped by last Tuesday, service was exceptional, Alaina was the girls name, couldn't have left happier.  Suggest the crab and art dip"}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem. The food is good and atmosphere is relaxed.  Our server, Matt, likes to joke but genuinely a really nice guy.  We checked in via Yelp and got a free appetizer with an alcoholic beverage purchase. Tried the Tuna Quesadilla and it was excellent! We shared it among 8 people. It comes with 4 slices that are packed with tuna.  As for a drink, I got the Kentucky mule which was refreshing. Mixed well.  For the burger, I got the Smoked Gouda burger. All burgers come with fries but you can upgrade to Cajun fries, their special 21 fries (garlic Parmesan), or onion rings.  Burger was delicious and really filling. The price is reasonable (maybe a little higher than average) but the food quantity and quality makes it worth it.  Come by for a burger fix! Or to watch some sports games with a few friends over some drinks and snacks."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, and you don't go here, you're really missing out!!  I am not a burger person, but I gave one a shot here, and this place makes a delicious, juicy burger of which I enjoyed every bite!  I had the Bacon Cheddar BBQ Burger.  It was simply amazing!  My husband had the Smoked Gouda Burger, and he also loved his burger. We both had the 21 fries. The seasoning on them was great!  Just the right amount of garlic and seasonings to give plenty of flavor, while not overwhelming them. The chipotle ketchup that came with them was a nice change from regular ketchup. The service was great.  They were attentive and very helpful answering questions about the menu.  And, our food came pretty fast.   Overall, the experience was excellent, and if we return to Cleveland, this will be on our list of \"to-do's\", again.  We were definitely not disappointed with this choice!! (Oh, and the quality of the food you get far exceeds the prices!)"}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM! Delicious food!! The bartender/chef whipped up our orders in a timely fashion and man, were they good!! The cuban and burger were fresh and tasty.  Drink deals are perfection -- stop here before a game and get cheap drinks - before you have to pay 10$ for a beer at the Q. GREAT PRICES AND FOOD.  woo hoo"}
{"text":"I'm finally writing this review...  I generally try to stick to positive reviews honestly. But as this is still weighing on my mind nearly a year later; it obviously must be said.   I was in town last fall (2014) for the Raiders/Browns game. The bar had been reserved for our Saturday night Raiders rally party. Raider fans really travel and so there were about 150 or so of us there. First off, the staff was obviously overwhelmed by the number of people who showed. And to be fair, every time we have reserved space at a local pub (in almost any city we've traveled to for a game), and we tell them to expect 200 people; they always think we are over estimating and don't staff up appropriately. So that's the first part. They just weren't prepared for that many people.   The bigger problem though was that at a \"sports bar\" with 5 or so tv's (so yes, it wasn't a huge space); they would NOT put a single tv on the WORLD SERIES; because Ohio State was playing.  And it was a regular season college game!!  Vs the THE WORLD SERIES!  Really?!?  In a room full of Bay Area fans and the Giants are in the World Series and all 5 tvs had to be on Ohio State?!?  I get that we are in Ohio; but cater to the majority of your crowd!  And, if you don't want to televise the World Series, then just call yourself an Ohio State bar, and not a sports bar.  We ended up leaving and heading around the corner to Leader Bar near our hotel. THAT bar actually reopened their kitchen to feed us (at 10pm) and had several tvs showing the World Series as well as tvs showing the Ohio State game. So it's obviously possible.   Based on the other reviews for this place, it just sounds like we caught them on a bad day. It's obviously a locals type place and they just weren't ready for a Raiders/sports fan invasion.  Really too bad too; because generally I'm a big fan of, and really like supporting, locals spots. And I know they aren't worried about this one review from someone who will likely never be back in Cleveland; but it had to be said."}
{"text":"I have stopped here before and had a beer or two. I returned after a cavs game because I hoped it wouldn't be very crowded even though it is right next to the Q. There were a few people but I was able to sit at the bar and tall without a giant crowd. I decided to order food and was BLOWN AWAY. All of their ingredients are fresh and their wings were unbelievable. Their fries were fresh cut and their quesadillas and burgers looked amazing. Deep fried portabellos. They have it all. I will be back here and ASAP for an amazing hidden food locale."}
{"text":"The owner of this place is great. Put on the hockey game for me. Beer was cold. Food was great. I will stop in again when I'm in town"}
{"text":"0 zeros if I could. Screwed up orders, took forever to get food. Cold fries. . Took forever to get bill and not even that crowded - came during tribe game. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I want to give 21 lounge a good review, I really do.  I like small start up businesses, with a good environment and great food.  But unfortunately a few things didn't match up to a 5 rating so I'm giving it a solid 4 instead.  A co-worker and I read many reviews from restaurants in the area before deciding on 21 Lounge on the final evening of our trip.  We had previously eaten at Winking Lizard, Hodge's and Butcher and the Barrel.  I saw a fried egg burger on the menu and it looked like it would hit the spot so off we went.  The night of our visit, there was a Cavs game starting within 2 hours, so traffic was already buzzing and we expected the place to be pretty packed.  The location of the entry isn't clear.  We, and plenty of others, thought it was located on the corner under the big sign... So when we walked in, it was EMPTY.  There were three guys sitting at the bar and only one table was seated. Immediate thought... Uh-oh... But we held in there.  The place has some great reviews on the food, it was rush hour, and Yelp advertised a 10% off discount for checking in, which I did.   Having previously had buffalo wings at the Winking Lizard, I was still craving them a bit so I ordered that as an appetizer.  YUM.  Probably not the absolute best most original authentic wings I've ever had but they were delicious.  They were served with a homemade, secret recipe ranch dressing, a recipe that they apparently acquired from Alvie's, a closed restaurant famous in the area.  The ranch was good.  It did taste homemade, a definite note of real dill on my first taste, but other than that, I just dipped my wings in it and the wing sauce pretty much over powered it.  The only thing about the wings, it would have been nice to have a celery garnish included and you actually had to pay a dollar extra for the ranch.  :/  I would have been happy with regular ranch for free.    Next up, I ordered, as anticipated by the menu on Yelp, the fried egg burger.  I pretty much expected the \"easy over egg\" (as described on the menu) to run all over the burger when I bit into it.... I was really looking forward to that part.  Didn't happen.  The egg was somewhere between over medium and hard cooked.  Other than that, the burger was pretty good.  I think the bun was brioche and it really enjoyed that nice touch.    The burger was served with fries.  21 Lounge serves an upgrade called 21 Fries for a $1 more.  They tasted really good, but unfortunately I had to salt them a little.  The 21 fries are tossed with raw garlic, rough grated parmesan cheese and fresh herbs and served with chipotle ketchup.  The other flavors totally over powered the \"chipotle\" that was in the ketchup.  Like I said, the fries were good... What was NOT so good, was walking back to my hotel with a strong overwhelming taste of garlic resounding in my mouth.  Honestly, I brushed my teeth right when I walked back in the hotel room, and could still prominently taste it even the next morning before brushing again.  So if it's a date night or important business dinner, you may want to rethink the fry upgrade.  If you LOVE garlic, then go for it.  I'm sure plenty do.  After a while, the waitress brought the check.  I'm guessing she was an owner because she seemed to be really knowledgable and mature for a waitress.  She had also been kind enough to point out that the table we chose near the window tends to get pretty cold.  That was a nice tidbit to know prior to sitting down. At some point through the meal, I had pointed out my phone showing the Yelp 10% discount.  I didn't notice until after she had already swiped my card that the Yelp discount had not been applied.  Sure I could have said something, but I had already waited long enough for her to pick up our credit cards, and, seriously, even longer for her to bring them back so I just said screw it and signed.    Moral of the story, I liked this place.  There were some flaws, some things I wish may have gone a little differently, but all in all, it was a great place to grab a bite, especially if you're headed to a Cavs game.  Food was good, didn't take too long, and is definitely higher caliber than your typical bar food."}
{"text":"The service at this place was fantastic. The waitress even tipped us off about the Yelp coupon. The blue burger and the buffalo chicken wrap were delicious. The house made fries and potato salad were excellent sides. I totally recommend this place before a game. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stooped in for dinner before Cleveland's Downtown Winterfest. Braised rib grilled cheese and bacon Bleu burger cooked to requested temp medium was amazing. Came back after event for more drinks."}
{"text":"Been frequenting this pace for about three months. This is the place you find and ask yourself \"where have you been all my life\". Every order is made fresh with amazing yet simple ingredients. I have been attempting to try something new each time but that's not always the case, because I can't help but order the best burger I've had in my life!!!!! The Blue cheese Bacon Burger is an amazingly brilliant compilation of fresh produce, meat, FULL flavored bacon and love. I actually took time to reflect during each juicy bite!! I have ordered many burgers in my time but this one has taken my breath away. The owners are great, down to earth people serving great food in big servings at great prices!! I look forward to each new order and what new culinary sensation they will present !!!!!!! This is a must when visiting downtown CLE. Easy to find off of Prospect Ave!!!"}
{"text":"A really great find!  After the Trans-Siberian Orchestra let out, we wandered around downtown in lieu of fighting traffic.  We first walked right by this place without even realizing it was there.  Thankfully we spotted it on the way back to the car and decided to stop in since they weren't slammed with customers.  We figured there was probably a reason for that but we went in anyway.  What a pleasant surprise to find that the food was great at a good price and the service was just as good.  Mind you that we only had bar food, bleu cheese burger with their signature hand cut fries and jumbo Buffalo wings.  The bartender sold me on the fries touting how they where homemade.  They where fantastic,  Mine where the normal kind but my companion got their signature seasoned fries for something like a buck more and they too were outstanding.  I myself, being a transplant from Buffalo, was delighted to find a place with real jumbo wings instead of those pathetic things that you could swear came off a pigeon that seems to be a standard around the Cleveland area.  The thing that pushed this place over the top along with the food was the service.  The bartender was extremely helpful and was diligent in keeping the place clean and tidy.  The best part was as she was sweeping the floors, another couple came in and ordered a couple of beers.  She politely asked them to wait one minute, put the broom away and promptly washed her hands right before she served them.  Outstanding.  My only regret is that we live 45 minutes away from this place.  We will be back next time we are downtown."}
{"text":"This was our hidden gem.  My husband and I have been there many times and brought many friends.  Although they did a nice remodel minus the extremely SMALL four tops (one beer bucket with no ice and table was full) made us not order apps.  Service was beyond awful and super slow.  Maybe a new chef as well since wings were under cooked and burgers were borderline rare. I never received the fries to comment on them.  Super unfortunate that as nice as it now looks inside they have lost everything else we appreciated.  Time to find another gem!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend from work. We both had the blackened chicken salad, and it was really delicious.  We also split 10 wings as an appetizer, and they were perfectly prepared and the sauces were delicious. Elaina, one of the owners, was the bartender and cook, and she was really friendly and quite delightful. I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"I rarely give a place 4 stars if I am not completely satisfied with their service BUT I am going to give this place a break since I went near their opening. The waitress/owner apologized many times for the food taking too long and I tend to give places a break when they are new.  The food is superb and the drinks for a downtown Cleveland spot are decently priced. This place is off the beaten path but it's well worth eating here! I got the chicken salad sandwich (one of my must try staples at every restaurant that offers it) and it was the biggest most delicious chicken salad sandwich!!   Be patient with this place as their menu is ever changing as they are trying to figure out what dishes do/don't work. Even with all the changes the food stays delicious and homemade!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem.  Great burgers and fries, and a nice quiet place for lunch downtown.  Loved the fried egg burger"}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent and the prices weren't bad.  I didn't see a beer list so no idea what their selection was like other than the 5 or so that were on draft.  What I didn't like though, and why we probably won't ever be back, is that other bars we have gone to to listen to bands, if they have a cover but you get there before the cover you don't pay.  We got to 21 Lounge early to get dinner and hang out with our friends before the bands came on, and right before the bands, a guy came around to everyone in the bar and had them pay $10 a person to stay.  I thought that was crazy!  The sound system was bad too so the bands didn't even sound that good."}
{"text":"Went here before a Tribe game.  The interior is a little weird.  The cinder block walls aren't too inviting.   Food sounds better than it tastes...3 stars.   Nothing special.   Service was really good... She was on the ball and attentive.  Drink specials during games."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants that I have eaten at recently.  Absolutely loved the chicken quesadilla.  Food and drinks all decently priced.   Tucked away on E. 2nd.  This is a must stop at place.  Can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"Ordering using an app, and it was ready for me in about 15 minutes. I even had someone call me to confirm my order, which was nice to know someone was actually working on it. The food was delicious, and priced well. I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"I believe this bar just recently opened. It's tucked away a bit off the main drag but it's a very neat little bar with a dive bar feel. My friend had a show there and every single person in the bar was someone who knew the band so we had the place to ourselves. The bartender was nice and there was a pretty decent amount of beers on tap. It's a nice, small bar that had some Christmas lights hung up on the ceiling, which I always like! My friends had some issues with the sound but I'm going to write that off as a learning experience for the bar, since it's obviously not something they've done very many times yet. It was overall a nice place that I'd definitely return to!  My only real complaint is that our table was RIGHT next to the door and it was freezing outside. I would have preferred it if there were some way to block the wind out.. but it didn't ruin my night or anything."}
{"text":"There isn't much that is special about that this place, and that's what makes it very special. It is hard to find a nice, inexpensive, and comfortable place downtown after work hours. This place fills that void. The food is great for the price, the service is nice, and the atmosphere is your typical local sports bar joint. I don't come here often, but I am happy when I do."}
{"text":"Great food...recently had their chicken quesadilla and loved it!    Also had great attentive service in a laid back, friendly atmosphere.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"***THEY WILL NO LONGER HONOR THE YELP CHECK-IN DEAL, BUT THERE'S A FACEBOOK DEAL INSTEAD***  On to the review...  There's service and then there's SERVICE, so lemme tell ya about my girl here, Alexandra. There are many like her, but this one is mine. J/K, she'll help anyone and she's damned good at it.  Prompt, friendly, aloof, comprehensive, patient and full of suggestions for a rather indecisive crowd. We stopped in here to duck the rain prior to UFC 203 and the place filled up quickly. The staff was hustling to keep up but performed admirably and served plates which were quickly devoured.  We had copious sums of Bourbon, gin, beer, and excellent sammiches with which to soak up the spirits.  Don't miss the Facebook deal and tell Alexandra that the donkey says,\"hey, girl!\""}
{"text":"This food is pretty decent. I only have used this as an order out option. I love that you can have this delivered if you order on GrubHub or Eat24. I usually get their club sandwich. It's pretty tasty. Sometimes the produce on it is not the freshest but I have had much worse. The fries are delish! They're hand cut and lightly seasoned."}
{"text":"I dropped into this place since it was on my walk between the casino and the jake, and I'm glad I did. The woman who took care of my group was pleasant, informative, and even cooked our food which was all fresh and delicious. I would strongly recommend the fries, and ask for the homemade chipotle ketchup and/or ranch which are both fantastic.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Saw good reviews so went before a tribe game Wednesday around four pm. Terrible experience, walked right in and sat myself along with my girlfriend. Place was empty and Didn't see a SOUL until some random guy walked in from the outside and asked us if we have been taken care of. Clearly we haven't but once the waiter gave us our drinks we ordered two specials that were on the sign listed outside. Even though they were on the sign they were sold out before four pm. Terrible service along with a terrible atmosphere, will not be back."}
{"text":"Came in given the great reviews. Just a short walk from the Q-Arena, Progressive field. Sports bar type décor. We came in about 3p and didn't realize they serve lunch from 11-2p and then dinner from 4p and after - apparently the only hour they have off of food prep. They were nice enough to still serve us food at this time. The happy hour drink specials are great (sorry I can't remember exactly what they were) - got a perfect spicy Bloody Mary $4.  I had their Signature 21 burger which was cooked perfect medium, seasoned well on a buttered/grilled roll with cheddar, bacon and horseradish slaw. This burger was so flavorful and the slaw was perfect - you can get on the side, which I recommend if you aren't getting the burger to try it. The bacon was crispy and great with the rest of the flavors. They have fresh house cut fries - which were hot, crispy and not greasy at all. I am not a fan of garlic/parm but you can add this on top for an extra $1.50 which seems reasonable. I agree with other reviews the ranch is so wonderful, homemade and insane flavor, it's $1 for a large side and you need this.  My mom got the Salmon BLT which was on a nice crusty roll, the salmon was flaky, flavored well - also with Bacon. It came with a fresh side salad. She loved this and was definitely enough for 2 meals.   Service was friendly and accurate. 10% off with yelp check in.   Check it out and make sure you get some fries with ranch to dip in."}
{"text":"Ordered the bacon cheddar BBQ burger through Grubhub. Came out fast and the woman working there when I picked it up was extremely nice. The burger itself was amazing and I had the 21 fries which were good as well."}
{"text":"I am in Cleveland for business and looked up this location on Yelp.  The food and service was top notch!  I ordered the sliders and they were the best I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Went for a bite before the arena bowl. Food was awesome (seems like it is actually made in the back), good drink specials and not super crowded! Definitely will come back again. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Got a chicken & bacon sandwich/burger with the 21 fries. Wasn't that great. Average bar food and I found the fries to be dry. Didn't have a beer, so maybe that would have made it better. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Completely screwed up my order. The guy said he was going back to the store to go get my correct order and he never showed up. I call his number to see what's up and he answers and hangs up.   Do not eat at this place. They have no common courtesy for customers or people. If your too busy then hire more employees. Complete bs. I will never order from them again.   E-"}
{"text":"Ordered a burger and fries. Burger was perfectly cooked and the 21 fries are worth the extra $1. The wife's fish was good with a peppery finish. Not real busy, so the service was excellent and our server knew her beers."}
{"text":"Last night after watching some March Madness in the warehouse district we decided we wanted to grab some food on E. 4th and headed over, but every place was packed. So then I remembered this place which is tucked away on the corner by the casino parking lot and had always heard the food was great. So the five of us stopped in.  No line. No wait. Which was perfect since we were all hungry. My buddy ordered the catfish nuggets which was definitely enough to share. They were delicious, lightly breaded and very tender and served with a healthy portion of fresh cut fries. The bartender/server was very attentive to us and made sure our waters and drinks never got low and asked to put on the games we wanted. I even got college wrestling for awhile!   We all mostly got sandwiches/ burgers or wraps which is typical for American bar food. The recommendations from the staff were the Sherwin Williams chicken sandwich, and 21 Reuben Burger. Which my brother and fiancé got. I had the BBQ Bacon Burger cooked medium with 21 fries, which is a modest up charge of $1.50 from regular fries. I like having garlic and parmesean as an option.  Everyone was very happy with their burgers, and we were even given some pickles which don't typically come with meal. Just have to ask apparently. One other person got the portobello wrap and was very happy with his choice too. Definitely would come back, especially when E. 4th is too busy and all you want to do is eat some good food. Also great for sports games."}
{"text":"Awesome food with great downtown location. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This bar is fantastic. It's hidden away, but it's a real gem. Matt, the owner pours his heart and soul into his bar and it shows. They have an awesome lunch and dinner service, with a large selection of beer and mixed drinks.   The bar manager, Alexandra, is amazing. She works hard to make sure 21 bar and lounge is always wonderful. She cares so much. Make sure to try some of their draft beers or $2 budweisers. I go here for the friendly atmosphere and the great food and drink."}
{"text":"What a roller coaster of a night we had here! We walked into a half empty bar to be acknowledged by no one for a solid 7 minutes.   We finally ordered our food to a very confused bartender, separately from another couple, and got a table. The bar then started to get really busy (cavs finals). So when a simple order of fish bites and a burger took an hour , we cut them some slack. Finally we went to check on it, -\" oh, we walked all around the bar and couldn't find you, I don't know what happened to your food. I will take it off your bill\" Ok... So are we going to get our food ? Oh you still want it?? Um yes!!!!  Then the other couple went to check on theirs- their order was never put in. Our food arrived shortly after. One was a wrap instead of quesadilla - sent it back. Quesadilla never came- forgot to put that order in too.   Then Mitchell the bartender smoothed everything over and gave us free drinks, but we gladly left.  Then something amazing happened. We tried to get into the Cavs watch party -out of beer. Tried to go to Paninis - max capacity. Went to wilberts - literally 100 degrees in there. Suddenly we yearned to be back at 21 at our little table in the corner drinking free drinks with unobstructed views of the TV. So we went back! Quickly got a seat at the bar, and spent the rest of the night watching the Cavs lose amidst incompetent employees serving lukewarm beer out of a Rubbermaid Container and mixing up insanely inaccurate drinks! (I.e putting an entire shot of grenadine in each shot )  Thanks for being such a piece of garbage, so that seats were available on this crazy night in CLE! 3 stars in instead of one! Someone call the Bar Rescue tip line !"}
{"text":"I've got food from them 4 times already and each time, it's been amazing. I love the chicken tenders and the cajun fries. The buttermilk ranch dressing is also AWESOME! So far, the food has always been fresh, hot and well seasoned. Great staff and although the location is a bit hidden from view, it's worth a visit. The prices are awesome compared to other local bar restaurants.   Definitely loving this place. I'm actually surprised it didn't have more reviews. Must be one of Cleveland's secrets."}
{"text":"Closed after an Indians game! What is the point of having a downtown restaurant if you're not  going to be open after tribe games. Booooo"}
{"text":"This place has potential but their staff is so unprofessional and disrespectful. They advertised a live Grateful Dead 50th Anniversary party concert stream and I went down with some friends. They couldn't get the stream to work and every time someone asked the bartender what the issue was he just basically yelled at patrons and said I don't know what's wrong. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"My new favorite hideout downtown. I love living downtown and exploring the area, especially because of places like this! It's tucked back down East 2nd (which is across from East 4th, a little closer to the casino, on the other side of Prospect) which makes this place a little hard to find but boy am I glad I did. We were the only diners on a quiet Tuesday night and had the pleasure of learning more about the owners and their journey with 21 Lounge. Their produce is currently being grown in their garden and the owner is hand finishing a few new boards for the beautiful hard wood floors. My dad and I split sliders, fries and 10 mild wings and left extremely satisfied with our meals. I'm excited to come back here and share 21 Lounge with some of my friends, but I also love this place as a little hideaway - good food, no pretentiousness and cold beer. Cheers to that, Clevelanders!"}
{"text":"Off the beaten path. More attention to detail (service, atmosphere, presentation) would go a long way."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and it was through eat24. The experience was disappointing. It took them 2 hours to deliver (about half an hour after the estimated time).   I ordered cheeseburger and it was cold and there were supposed to be some lettuce, tomato, and Onion. I only got a cheese with burger in badly prepared bread. They sliced the top of the bread. The coke was 20 oz bottle and it was warm. They didn't mention the size in the menu, and the price is similar to the 22 oz bottle. Quit disappointing!   I gave them 2 stars because the first time I ordered was much better. This was my second time and it could be the last."}
{"text":"So I haven't had burger in about 6 months, I think, when I ordered from here, which could be also why I thought it was so amazing! The fries was little burn and the onion rings soggy.. But the actual burger SOOOO good!"}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time on a busy Friday night-was very crowded but was able to order a drink easily. Took a look at their extensive menu which looked very good, ordered the special which was a chicken portabello melt with mixed greens and garden tomatoes-perfectly toasted! Came with thick cut fries with some kind of garlic cheese topping, crunchy and tasty. Had a great time and will def visit this place again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food - hidden in the alley so you have to look for it.  The nachos are stellar as well as the the chicken bites."}
{"text":"Alexandra the bar manager is amazing! So happy we stopped here. She makes sure that all of her customers are well taken care of and is very personable. I recommend this bar highly!"}
{"text":"Cheap cheap cheap drinks before Tribe game.  This place came to be when Alvies Gateway Grill merged w a bar.  The result?  Amazing food and decent prices.  The bartenders are very friendly and menu items notes \"specialty\" 21 Lounge menu items.  Whatever you do...under ANY circumstance.....you MUST order the ranch dressing with your fries.  The ranch dressing will change your life.  It's the same ranch they had a Alvies.  I have no clue what they add to it but fantastic.  They also have a spend $20 for $10 Yelp coupon which you should def take advantage of (make sure to tip FULL amount people).  The one thing that scares me about this place is the location is so hidden and the place isn't really busy that it might go away.  \"Hidden gems\" when it comes to bars can be great but if they stay hidden for too long.....the vanish."}
{"text":"Very empty when we got here. Waitress was a bit flustered (said she's usually a bartender). Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! Wouldn't go anywhere else. Great service and the staff is personable and will do anything to help you get the best deal. Bartender was amazing and helped with our overall experience in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Sadly have to dock a star as the service was subpar during my last visit. The server seemed very frazzled despite there only being three tables full. Had minimal knowledge of beers on tap and even more common canned beers (PBR?) and my buddies mixed drinks were not good.  Two of four orders were wrong, but we didn't say anything because we weren't confident that they'd even be fixed properly. The waitress was really sweet and told good stories, we liked her enough to stay and order drinks at the bar afterwards...may just need a helping hand or better training.  At any rate, the food was still great. Still love the 21 Fries. I ordered a buffalo chicken salad and received some sort of a grilled chicken salad instead. Despite not being what I ordered, it was very tasty - the chicken had great flavor, the greens were fresh, and that ranch dressing is so on point! Some of my companions ordered wings, which were again nice and crisp and not too much sauce.  I think the place needs to work on their service as I don't think either of the people I brought would come back after this visit - and not because the food wasn't good. I'll still be back as I know they've gotten it right in the past and the bar food is a notch above other places in the area."}
{"text":"First time was there on a fluke... Passed it by accident when searching for parking. Other places were packed and this looked empty. Went in ordered some beers and burgers from an unkept guy behind the bar. Someone at the bar was eating a burger that looked good, so we ordered that. I headed for the men's room and made a way wrong turn. I got a glimpse of their kitchen. FILTHY! Wow!... Turned around, found the restroom and went back to the bar. Cancelled the burgers and left. The main space there was not clean either... Should've known better. Turns out that lady eating at bar was employee. Went back about six weeks later with a chick who wanted to hear a band that was playing so her group/event could consider hiring them. We may have been the only two people there (out of about 15) that didn't each other or know the band. Place still not very clean. Won't likely be going back. On a good note, the beers were cold."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! One of the best wings I've ever had!! They bring the wings in fresh and are never frozen! We came here on a whim after an Indians game and thankfully the other establishment around the corner was busy because we would have never ventured around the corner. Service was great and I definitely would become a regular here if I lived in Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"3 orders 2 were a bust. Placed latest order an hour before my lunch time. 15 minutes before my lunch time I get a call that the restaurant is out of mushrooms for my mushroom wrap. I am vegetarian there was nothing but salads left on the menu. Very very very angry that I'm here at my lunchtime with no food. I am very hungry as I had to skip breakfast and now I'm going to have to wait another hour for another place to bring me food .I can't recommend this place anymore. Two out of three orders messed up??? No never never again. Skip this place!!!!! I wish I could leave no stars.    Big pluses, big minuses. A fellow vegetarian co worker suggested I order from here. Being that I was rear ended the night before I wasn't keen on driving so the fact they delivered was what sold me. I ordered thru Yelp 24/7. Was told expected delivery was noon. It came at 1230. I ordered the portobello pressed sandwich which came with a salad. They did not bring the dressing. So I have a salad without dressing. Fine. The Cajun fries were cold  and soggy so I will throw em under the broiler at home. So that's 2 items I won't be eating for lunch. The sandwich itself while small was delicious. I'm quite disappointed but the taste of the sandwich was a plus. I'll pass on ordering again."}
{"text":"Worst place in downtown cleveland, went there instead of E.4th before the parade due to overcrowdedness at the actual good bars so we figured we'd go there and be in and  out due to the lack of patrons they had compared to Harry Buffalo and Flannerys, boy was that not the case! They were not prepared one bit and the girl behind the bar seemed like she was nervous and unsure about her job while who i assume is the manager walked around yelling at the staff about how nothing was ready while we sat there waiting??he was really rude to us as if we were a burden to him so we walked out. I feel sorry for anyone who has to work for him and the owner should look into this. (God forbid he was the owner) because he looked as if he'd just ended a 7 day meth binge. Had a blast at actual parade but this was a bad start and it's because of this establishment. Get your shit together 21 lounge."}
{"text":"We went on New Years Eve and the food was better than expected.  We ordered dry rub cajun wings which I actually have to say were the best dry rub wings that I've ever had.  I've had wings at quaker steak, winking lizard, etc. and they were pretty solid.  Then I had the pulled pork burger which surpisingly was cooked exactly as ordered while most places I go overcook things when I ask for medium (I hate when I ask for medium and there is no pink in the burger, it drives me crazy).   My fiancé got the buffalo chicken wrap which was a tad hot for her liking, but the 21 fries that she got were awesome.  We each had drinks which were well made and reasonably priced.  I wouldn't expect anything earth shattering here, but everything we had was great and we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"(updating)  a local's review: they're changing their menu around and it keeps getting better. I'm loving the portablo press. Their chicken and burgers are A+ too :)"}
{"text":"Even when it's a slow night and only the bartender who is your cook is there cooking the food is amazing. Try this place out you won't regret it"}
{"text":"I took them up on offer to return and was glad I did! I had the Buffalo chicken wrap and it was delicious. Arrived hot too. Definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"A really nice choice for a clean, quiet place to quaff a few beers downtown before or after a game or when you need to escape the trappings of E. 4th or the casino. It's in between all of those things, and seems to go unnoticed for some reason. That's too bad because they have some kickass wings, a small but tasty selection of taps, and really friendly service. They're also open for lunch with the crew from the now-closed Alvie's whipping up the food."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. Sherwin Williams chicken sandwich with the 21 fries.  Met Ron the bartender, awesome guy to talk to and hang out.  So glad we found it.  Hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"\"You got ten minutes to order\" when I asked for hotel delivery.   I should have hung up, right then. They didn't appreciate the order and boy, howdy, did that show in the quality.   I ordered a Sherwin Williams sandwich and the grilled broccoli for delivery to my hotel. The sandwich tasted good, but the chicken was so rubbery, it was probably vulcanized. I mean, it fought back at every bite so I'd guess that it was a frozen breast from Sam's Club.   The 21 Fries were in badly need of salt and the promised ketchup. No problem, I'll just go.... Oh yeah, I'm in a hotel.   The grilled broccoli was good, but despite their efforts to wrap the box in cling wrap, the delivery driver still managed to spill the steaming hot sauce everywhere in the bag. HUGE MESS.   I really should have gone with Rocco's,  as recommended by the hotel, instead.   Two stars because the broccoli was good."}
{"text":"Omg! Incredible hole in the wall! Alexandra is an incredible bartender and woman! The food was delicious and very reasonable on the price for what you get. Please find this place to enjoy yourself and save money on food and drink compared to places out on the main roads!"}
{"text":"Ordered and took over an hour for delivery. Delivery guy went to the wrong building and then gave me attitude when I told him he was 8 blocks away.  When I got my salad, it didnt have croutons like the description stated it did, and they delivered it with no salad dressing which I specified on the order what kind I wanted.  Not worth the 13.50 spent."}
{"text":"I couldn't have had a better experience at 21 Lounge. My wife and I walked in on a cold Monday night in December, and the place was pretty empty. A delivery person from GrubHub came in 3-4 times during our visit, so it seemed like most folks were skipping the cold and having their food delivered. Not my wife and I. We saw 4.5 star reviews, and we to get inside.  I remember 21 Lounge from it's days as Cleats. While I'm a fan of Cleats, this experience was a giant upgrade over the previous concept. Why? The food. What an upgrade. You can tell there is real work put into this food, and the owners themselves tend to do most of the cooking. There is real care, and they trust themselves to make your dining experience great.  We ordered a few beers, some matzo ball soup, and our entrees at the same time. The owner was nice enough to ask us what we wanted to watch on TV, giving us the free range to watch anything our hearts desired from the Columbus Blue Jackets to Matlock. Now that's service. Due to the slow night, we really got to have some great conversations with the owner about the culture and renaissance of downtown Cleveland, and how things had changed over the years. She wasn't pining for tips, just looking to talk and hopefully enlighten about our comeback city.  Our matzo ball soup was made with care. A humongo squishy, juicy matzo ball can really brighten one's gloomy day. Then, the burgers. My, oh my these burgers. First off, they're huge. Secondly, they're accompanied with about a half pound (or more) of fries. The plate is filled. I recommend you upgrade to the 21 fries (served with some delicious parmesan and chipotle ketchup). I ordered \"The Fried Egg\" because I'm such a sucker for a fried egg on a burger. The yolk added some extra flavor, but the burger itself was cooked perfectly medium and packed full of flavor. I could not put it down.  It wasn't just the burgers that impressed, as my wife ordered the 21 Chicken Club, and it is sure a club you want to join. Grilled Chicken  | fried egg  | apple wood bacon | tomato | red onion | lettuce | cheddar | sour dough  | fries | aioli. If you can join all of those ingredients into a perfect harmony inside a club sandwich, you have won my heart and the heart of many others. My wife NEVER finishes her plate. But this time, it wasn't even a hesitation, the plate was cleaned before mine.  This place gets pretty busy before/after sports games, and I would certainly recommend it during those times. But I'd recommend it even more during their slow periods. The prices are very affordable, and they often run a Yelp deal to knock a few bucks off the bill. We'll be regulars."}
{"text":"Chef said \"You're in for a treat\" when he sat one beast of a burger in front of me. Shockingly enough he was right! I had the best burger I have ever had in downtown Cleveland that could easily compete or beat some of my all time favorite burger places. I will definitely be back for more... On my next cheat day that is"}
{"text":"Great service!  Worked with us for a group of 18.  I had the Sherwin Williams.  Seasoning on the blackened chicken was delicious!  Fries were good too!"}
{"text":"Walking in on a frigid Saturday night glad to be out of the cold, we were the only guests other than the bridal party of 15 that was wrapping up. Our server was rude when we were finally greeted and impatiently took our drink order. Heaven forbid you order hot tea...you get eyes rolled at you! Very unprofessional server, as I know, I have done it high end for many years, unbeknownst to her. Needless to say her tip went way down the second she greeted us. No matter how nice she pretended to be after that point it did not change what I left her. Once you treat guests like that, there is no going back. She should not be in customer service. However, the food was outstanding. The basket of fried catfish and parmesan fries is amazing. Highly recommend. Just hope you don't get an impatient, eye rolling, fake personality of a server like we did! Off the beaten path down an alley near 4th street."}
