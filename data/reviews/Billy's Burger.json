{"text":"Enjoying the hamburger steak and eggs.  The patty appears to be homemade and is a great value at $5.  Its a greasy spoon for sure but I will be back to try their WOR won ton."}
{"text":"Looking for some cheap diner food but not sure whether you want Chinese or burgers? This is the place for you. Hiding in a little strip mall along Edmonton Trail you'll find 'The Billy Burger' - and despite varying signage, they're probably open.  I wanted to take a photo of the menu, but it's spread over two walls behind the counter as well as A4 pieces of paper covering the counter and above the drinks fridge. You can choose from around 20 Chinese meals for $7.25ish (each with a photo!) western meals from breakfast to burgers ($4-5ish), fries ($3) etc, and then add coffee ($1.55), wine/beer ($5.50ish), and cans of pop ($1.35). It's an order and pay at the counter kind of a place.  The inside is pretty big and you can have your choice of comfy seats and booths, all of which endearingly look like they're from the 60s - 80s, complete with four old school 'fat' TVs randomly in the middle.  From our order of Western (bacon burger and fries) and Chinese (#8 - two spring rolls, bbq pork, chicken chow mein and egg fried rice), I think my Chinese meal won out. It's definitely not on par with the restaurants of Chinatown, but made for a fun and cheap hangover diner meal on a day when most places were closed over New Years."}
{"text":"They are, hands down, the most affordable breakfast joint in all Calgary! Bring $10 and your morning hungers are all gone. The Cowboy breakfast is a favorite. Ignore it's dingyness and and enjoy the tasty affordable meal you'll get."}
{"text":"Very cheap and very fast, some stuff is awesome some is not so. You can order anything from your typical Chinese food offerings to bacon and eggs or chicken fried steak. the owners get more talkative the more you go."}
