{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the Phoenix area, period.  A small place, doing it right. Making their own fresh bread, their own hummus. I had the ajja merguez and hummus, and the flavors were bold and bright. The bread comes out hot, and it's so soft but with a satisfying chew.   Go here if you enjoy awesome food."}
{"text":"The owners of this place were super nice and welcoming the food was very good and authentic we tried the lamb sausage and eggs and also couscous w lamb everything was great. Five stars"}
{"text":"Amazing Food! The nice lady who was the cook was very welcoming, and recommended foods based on out party of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids).  It is very neat and clean place. All the food choices were excellent. I am so glad we decided to stop by and try her food.  Very honest owners and the quality was food was very good. Fresh, made to order food."}
{"text":"We had a good time eating dinner at this location.  The lady was very kind and patient as we were trying to question her about all the dishes and also she was happy to alter few dishes as per our need! I personally loved the chicken shawarma wrap!! It was divine with nice spices in it!  She was patiently waiting until we finished our dinner and while we were chatting at our table to decide on which dessert to order and at that moment she confessed that she had to hurry for her daughter's graduation by then and her family were waiting outside.we made our dessert order to go and she was feeling happy and guilty that she offered us few more deserts on behalf of her daughter graduation !! We would definitely go there again for that warm home cooked style food:)"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place the food and custom service is phenomenal. When I arrived to a cute little hole in the wall I was kind of skeptical. When we stepped in a voice from the kitchen said please have a seat I'll be right with you. A pleasant lady came out with two menus and sat down ince she started talking I felt right at home. I had the chicken shawarma plate my friend had the lamb plat  both was equally delicious.."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this restaurant after reading the reviews here on Yelp. Walking in at 5 pm and being the only customers, we thought it might have been a mistake. We ordered at the counter from the small menu and were told it would be about 15 minutes prep time, so we ordered a small hummus. When the hummus was brought to our table, and after the first taste. I understood why this place was getting such rave reviews. Drizzled with olive oil and just the right amount of spices on top, it was the best hummus I've ever eaten. The table settings look like they should be somebody's grandma's best place settings, although oddly paired with plastic flatware. I had the rose water which was quite refreshing and the right amount of flavor. My falafel was perfect. After finishing, we were convinced to try the baklava. I've always been a fan of baklava and love to try some whenever it's available. This was definitely the best I've ever had; just the right amount of light, flaky crust, fairly moist and not dry or hard, and plenty of real honey filling. The lady who served it had also made it and she was very happy to explain that she uses only real honey and lots of it to make her baklava. You could tell she was very proud of it and she had every right to be - Best Baklava in Arizona! Come here for an outstanding meal that will exceed your expectations and extremely nice hosts."}
{"text":"Deserves 6 stars. Freshly prepared with a real love of the North African flavor profile. Authentic flavors. Sweets too and equally as good as entrees. Don't miss this spot."}
{"text":"After conducting a morning full of searches for med-cuisine I decided to give it go. I have to say That prior Yelp reviews were spot on as this place is excellent.. Very clean family owned and operated. Staff was very pleasant and accommodating. The Mrs, who prepares all the food (fresh and homemade). After eating here you will see the passion and love that goes into her cooking! They made a regular customer out of me going forward. Very happy!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing! Definitely get the lamb shank while you are here. Be patient; the owner is the cook, host, and waitress. She's a great cook! Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"We were in the area and yelp'd this place. It's one of those hole-in-the-wall places you are proud to introduce your friends to. A sweet lady proprietor plied us with freshly cooked food and Turkish coffee. My friend was very happy with the lamb shank and vegetarian me had a falafel plate. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had never tried Tunisian food before and after reading all of their reviews on Yelp my husband and I decided to give it a go. Best decision ever! You can taste the love and pride she (the owner/,chef) takes in the food she prepares. Absolutely loved it, I don't have anything bad to say about the place or the people there, she's very suggestive if your lost or your first time"}
{"text":"Need a Tunisian mother that will cook amazing food, give life advice, and make sure you come back for more? This is your place. The lamb is the best in the valley and the home made bread is perfect for soaking up everything on the plate. Get the hot tea and plan on staying for a while."}
{"text":"Good middle eastern food and FANTASTIC service. What seems like the husband and wife pair that run the place were very welcoming, and very accommodating of my requests about animal products. They also brought out some free desserts!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there Thursday and I will definitely drive all the way back there 15 miles from where I live. I lived in France in a North African neighborhood and definitely consider all of those options comfort food for me. I had the most delicious merguez sausage sandwich with plenty of harissa, extra on the side. And then the french fries, they surpass In-N-Out.  The entire place is clean and tidy but the reason I would give it 10 stars is for the lovely hospitality of the Madame, owner and chef. It was so nice talking to her about the food and what I'm going to come back and order next time."}
{"text":"Try the Baklawa (sweet). And instead of getting rice as a side for your meats, do give the Couscous a shot - we found it is a great alternative!"}
{"text":"I purchased the groupon for this business.  They refused to honor it forcing me to get a refund from groupon.  If the owner is going to put this out they need to honor it.  Failing to do so is false advertising and a illegal business practice.  Response to comment:: Fact: I purchased the groupon less than 2 hours before coming to the restaurant.  Fact: Gropons are set up by owners of the business under contract with gropon.  Fact: when I showed up you refused to honor the groupon.  Fact: I had to get a refund from groupon due to you failing to honor your end of the contract.  My comments are fair and accurate.  If you have a dispute with gropon should not affect a new customer that comes into your establishment. By disagreeing with my statements it shows your lack of care for those that come into your establishment. Update : Groupon just contacted me and calmed responsibility.  I will be giving this restaurant another chanch. Until then I  am moving it to 3 vs 1 star because of the experience in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We had the lamb and chicken schwarma.  They were both delicious.  The meat was moist, ample, and the spicing was delicious.  If you are a fan of harissa then you will especially like these as that is the predominant spice.  And for $6 a sandwich - its a heck of a deal!  The atmosphere is casual, comfortable, and somewhat spare.  The cook/owner is very nice and pleasant to talk with and very happy to explain all the dishes.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Solid food-the waitress gave my wife and I fantastic recommendations. I had the lamb shank and couscous. It was cooked perfectly. I would get that again. There is a tuna sandwich I was eyeing that looked like what sandwiches probably look like in heaven. I'm getting that when I go back."}
{"text":"The best lamb shank I have ever had. The owner is incredibly kind. I honestly recommend this place all time."}
{"text":"My first for Tunisian cuisine and my tastebuds have been delighted !!!   Lamb shank, actually anything lamb, have been my favorites !!! Salad ~ yummm.  Rice ~ yummm.  Baklava ~ yummmmm !!!  Mint green tea is delish !!!   Nabiha is soooo personable and a wonderful hostess."}
{"text":"This is hole in a wall but food is very good..family based service and service is great. I had Ajia and my friend had beef kababs with couscous.. Very good! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is our second time at this restaurant. We loved it so much the first time, had to come back. Best Cous Cous around. The owners are great and service is wonderful. This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Habbouz, a quaint Tunisian restaurant, is to be found in a small parking lot in Phoenix. It's definitely worth the drive if you don't live close by! We were welcomed by the owners as soon as we walked in. Because we had never tried Tunisian food, we were really excited, and even more so after we got in! The owners were great about explaining the menu items and assured us that we'd be having a delicious meal. Being as hungry as we were, we got the Slata Mechouiya right away to start. It was a mixture of green peppers & tomatoes topped with olive oil which was to be eaten with their traditional bread. The closest thing I can think of to what it tastes like is maybe some sort of salsa but it's made with Tunisian spices, so it was very different. Very very good!  We put in our meal orders for the Ajja Merguez and the Chicken Mechoui. They cooked it all fresh, made to order, so it took a little bit of time to come out, however definitely worth the wait! The Ajja Merguez had homemade sausage which was different & more delicious than any sausage I've ever had and the sauce was PHENOMENAL! I would seriously ask for just that in a bowl, topped with a fried egg (which they had perfectly cooked by the way - runny in the middle) and the bread and be very very satisfied! I've never had this flavor before, but like I said, I'd get it all day long!  The Chicken Mechoui which was my dish was weird. There was just something off about the chicken that I couldn't place. It tasted burnt even though the chicken itself wasn't burnt and it was really dry. I did eat the couscous that was around it. I really wanted to get rice but was told the couscous would be worth the try so I went ahead with that. It was fluffy & soft and well flavored. Like I said before though, the chicken which should have been the highlight of the dish was a big disappointment, which is the reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars.  I'd recommend getting the Slata Mechouiya & Ajja Merguez. You won't be disappointed! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Soooo good!! I was in the mood for Greek so we looked around on Yelp for a good place to try. Based on the ratings came here. Ratings are all true. Tried the Chicken schwarma and chicken mechoui. They were both amazing! The owners were so sweet!"}
{"text":"Beautiful dining experience with a Groupon fiasco. The Tunisian food was truly fantastic. I was piqued when Groupon sent me via email featuring Habbouz Tunisian Cuisine. After looking at all the photographs and reviews, I decided to treat my hubby, who loves Mediterranean food to a Mediterranean meal of 2 shwarma sandwiches, one appetizer and 2 drinks for $15.   We got there in an unassuming strip mall on 27th Avenue between Glendale and Northern. The restaurant was bright and clean. There were two other tables occupied. A gentleman brought us our menus. We showed him our Groupon, and he received it.  We ordered a lamb and a chicken shwarma, and a hummus. Our hummus arrived first. I was chilled and topped with smokey paprika. It was slightly unsalted but probably good for the heart. The parts drizzled with olive oil were the best. The flat brad was unique was a nice herb or spice in the dough. Our shwarmas were flavorful. The lamb and the chicken were equally good. The black olives were slightly overpowering for our palettes. The spicing absolutely rich and layered. Then our kebab arrived. It was a homemade mixture of meat, herbs and spices grilled until is was crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. It was accompanied with a nice roasted pepper served on top a well-seasoned bed of couscous. The side salad was served with a nice vinaigrette. Warning: the tasty green olives have pits in them. Our server forgot our drinks, he asked what we wanted and served us two cans of Fanta orange.  The chef, the lady of the house, walked out a few times and looked over from the counter to check on how we were enjoying our food. We were all smiles.  Then came the Groupon fiasco. Our gentleman server treated the Groupon as $15 off the entire check. So according to him, our balance was the kebab plate plus $6.83 for the difference of the items we ordered. We asserted that the coupon said $15 was for the set Mediterranean meal and our balance was for the kebab plate. He was insistent, but I advocated and said I if he was right, I would not have bothered to buy a Groupon dollar for dollar. I would have simply purchased my meal outright from him bypassing the process. He finally conceded. I told my husband that we needed to tip for the full amount of the meal. The owner said we didn't have to. We insisted and tipped him for the full amount. We had determined to come back prior to the bill discourse. After that incident, it left a sour note, however, I plan on coming back because I believe that it was a misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the Groupon. Next time, I am not buying a Groupon, but I will use my 10% Yelp check-in reward for orders over $20. It is important to support diverse restaurant owners."}
{"text":"We decided to try Tunisian food based on the Yelp reviews.  So glad we did - it was excellent!   We tried the lamb shank and the ajja merguez based on reviews I read ... both were great.  The lamb shank was very tender and the sausages super tasty!    We will be back!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I just had delicious chicken shawarma and merguez. I enjoyed my shawarma meal as the salad, rice, and chicken were flavorful. The bread that accompanied our meals tasted homemade and fresh. The plates were plentiful and the owner was very kind."}
{"text":"I am so glad I decided to stop by this little gem of a restaurant today.  I ordered the Ajja Merguez with a side of rice.  What a unique dish!  Homemade sausage with a red pepper sauce and sunny side up eggs.  I ordered a side of Hummus with a wonderful blend of homemade spices.  Equally excellent was the service.  I felt welcomed and at home.  Next time I will try the lamb shank and couscous.  Highly recommend for a unique culinary experience!"}
{"text":"Chicken is moist, veggies are fresh, and owners were very friendly and sweet. Exact type of restaurant i want to give my business to.  Food is the best Mediterranean food I've had and if you browse through my reviews Ive been to quite a few. Great bang for your buck kind of spot!"}
{"text":"Three separate visits to this restaurant have left me really impressed each time. The ajja merguez was bursting with bold flavors and the big flatbread that accompanied the dish was perfect for wiping every bit of the tasty sauce off the dish. Similarly, the kebab was scrumptious and though I was not very hungry when I met my UYE group for the evening that I ordered this (and I was hoping I would have leftovers to take home), I ended up finishing it - and the salad of eggplant, capers, and olives that came with it. The lamb shank was fall-off-the-bone tender and nicely seasoned; I ordered it with rice, which I prefer over couscous. The hostesses are very friendly -- don't hesitate to ask them for suggestions. If you love Mediterranean-type cuisine and want to try a restaurant that sets the bar high for flavor and service, come here!"}
{"text":"If you need evidence that the valley is growing in it's diversity both demographically and gastronomically, let me set the stage for an unusual Saturday lunch visit I recently took.  Just a block south of Northern on 27th Avenue lies an old strip center.  Right around the middle of it, you'll find a relatively simple no frills restaurant run by a friendly enthusiastic woman named Nabiha.  She wears all the hats at this establishment.  She's the hostess, waitress, and yes also the head chef.  I would have just as much of a chance guessing what Tunisian cuisine entails as I would guessing the capital of Tunisia off the top of my head (Tunis in case you're wondering).  But I'd seen the rave reviews on Yelp and the Phoenix New Times and knew I had to give this place a look.  I was the first lunch customer of the day when I arrived.  After perusing the menu upon arrival, one dish that sounded delish to me was the Chicken Mechoui.  Grilled chicken with a special in house seasoning and sauce with your choice of rice or couscous (couscous for me this time) and a green salad on the side.  My timing was perfect as she had just whipped up a fresh batch of couscous in time for my meal.  When she brought out the plate, I was stunned at the portion size.  This is a plate of food probably meant for two people to share, but it was just me this go around.  There's really nothing about this dish I didn't like.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, a VERY hearty portion of that fresh couscous, chickpeas, and a fresh salad to boot.  I was about halfway through my meal when Nabiha asked if I'd like a piece of her baklava, to which I said yes of course (even though my quickly filling stomach was probably trying to wave me off).  Fortunately the baklava piece was small enough that it wasn't much more of a lift for my stomach and it was a nice treat.  Not quite as good as the baklava I've had at other spots in town, but very respectable.  Somehow I actually managed to finish this whole meal, but I had to take one of those food coma power naps afterwards.  Total cost for the lunch, piece of baklava, water, tax and tip came to about $20.  Hard to beat the value as the portion size was excellent.  Next time I come here, I'll probably try the Ajja Merguez and perhaps some of the other dessert options (though I'll probably bring a friend or family member to share the portions).  Yet another example of how helpful Yelp can be in discovering local gems many would otherwise pass right by without a second thought.  And another example of how unique locally owned spots like this one are making the valley's culinary and business community better.  Thanks Nabiha for the hospitality.  Keep that dessert case of yours stocked for my next visit."}
{"text":"I had the lamb shank with couscous and it was delicious! My friends really enjoyed their dish too. Very friendly couple runs the place and they make their food fresh, which is great. Too bad I don't live near this place or I would go more often."}
{"text":"Shared the hummus plate, couscous lamb, arabic coffee and baklava.   Hummus plate is decent, but the real flavor is from the dollop of harissa in the center. It's delicious, make sure to get a little bit in every bite. It's served with a flatbread that's not quite a pita and not quite a tortilla? It's thin, highly stretchy, and satisfying to rip and chew.  The couscous lamb was the star of the show. Fall-off-the-bone tender, flavor is deep and rich. The couscous was basically it's own dish, and could have easily filled someone on its own. Lots of tender chickpeas on the plate.   As a heads up, the arabic coffee is probably a lot stronger than people are accustomed to, served in an espresso cup. It's done in the turkish style where the coffee is ground down to an ultra-fine powder and then boiled until it becomes a thick liquid. You *will* be wired after having one or two little cups. I like strong coffee so it was a treat, but others who are not accustomed to the this style will probably be surprised by its potency.   The baklava is similar to baklava I've seen sold elsewhere, with the exception that it's fresher and the construction is a little simpler. Two layers of filo dough with one thick layer of nuts and honey in the middle, like a little baklava finger sandwich. It was delicious and satisfying.  I took a sip of some friends almond and rosewater drinks. They were pleasant, but very sweet, with the almond water tasting like a liquid version of marzipan.   Finally, Nabiha herself was our server and cook and she couldn't have been more personable and lovely. She treated us like family, gave us helpful recommendations, and charmed us from beginning to end.   I wish that they could also be open for dinner during the week, but if you can get out there for lunch there's so much to like."}
{"text":"Couscous was great, slata mechouia was spicy just like I like it.  Merguez was awesome.  Fresh made bread here and they cook with olive oil.  Will be back at least once a week, remind me of home."}
{"text":"I've never had Tunisian food before. It is decidedly Mediterranean. The boisterously warm owner, the simple surroundings, and the flavor of the food reminded me of the Turkish restaurant Ephesus (Bloomington, IL). The owner prepared my food fresh as I came in, and I could hear the kabob sausage sizzling.  So, why only 3 stars then? Well, sadly, the atmosphere and service were probably the best part. The food wasn't bad, but I found it unexceptional for what I'd paid. I was unexpectedly charged $1 for the water (it is possible she tried to warn me--we had some communication issues at times) and the biryani (really just rice) was $12.99, so after all was said and done and taxed and tipped, I paid $17 for a simple meal of sausage on rice with tossed salad on the side.  I might've been happier if I'd ordered the lamb shawarma. Well, at least I left with a full stomach and a bottle of water."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for lunch after seeing the good reviews here.  The sweet tea and lemonade was delicious, the hummus was spicy and creamy, and the roasted chicken on rice with salad was filling and tasty. The signature dish was eggs and sausage in a spicy tomato sauce. All these dishes are so well seasoned and delicious.  Our hostess was also our waitress and our chef!  Everything was made fresh after we ordered it.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ventured to the west side, and to this restaurant based on Daniel L.'s review.  I surmised by this Elite yelper's reviews that he has good taste, would never steer us wrong.   And he definitely did not!  We attempted to visit Habbouz several days earlier, but they were either closed early or not open at all due to it being a Sunday. Undeterred, we ventured out on a weekday that worked for both mine and my wife's schedule.  We arrived to an empty parking lot, and an empty restaurant. Normally, not a good sign, but we also deduced that perhaps this restaurant just hasn't attracted enough people yet to partake of and enjoy this delicacy.   As we walked in, we were greeted by the wonderful hostess, Nibiha. Who happened to be the owner and chef!  I don't know how long it has been since we had been welcomed into a restaurant with this much revelry, but it was quite flattering.  We told her that we had never experienced Tunisian food before, but would certainly like to sample their offerings. We also informed her to not hold anything back.  She described and recommended the Ajja Merguez (a sausage dish), the Couscous with Lamb Shank, and the Chicken Mechoui. She emphasized that everything is made fresh at her restaurant, and we would not be disappointed whatsoever.  So we went with her suggestions, and asked for our normal Diet Cokes.  Boy, did we get corrected on that! She proceeded to correct us regarding that fact that the juices they served are WAAAAYYY better than any soda, and she would not have none of that polluting the purity of her food.   She laughed, we laughed (maybe?), then she gave us Almond Water and Rose Water. Our take on this? No soda tasted as good as these delightful drinks.  The only concern that she seemed to have about the food preparation was the intensity of the spices. She seemed hesitant to spice up the food as she normally does because she felt that my wife would be taken aback by them.   We explained that we travel all over, and my wife can handle a variety of spicy dishes with no problem.  When the food arrived (see our pictures), they were wonderfully prepared, and the flavors were just simply wonderful. Definitely not your typical Mediterranean or African delicacies, but certainly a step above in freshness and piquancy.  The meats were just scrumptious and just melted in your mouth. And the sauces were simply delectable. Everything was just so wonderfully prepared, it's as if she stepped it up a notch just to impress the two of us.  And when we were all done, which didn't take long because there was just so much food, she proceeded to provide us a dessert treats of Baklava and YuYu. Her Baklava was similar to a small, sweet donut, and the YuYu was like a rice cake.  Both were delectable!  Nibiha's hospitality was just so endearing, and the overall food quality and presentation were just stupendous. It was such a great introduction to one of the world's many cultural delicacies readily available here in Arizona.  We are looking forward to our return trip to meet our gracious host, once again and partake of her freshly prepared dishes!"}
{"text":"First of all, it's a really simple casual vibe.  Don't expect music or anything fancy.  Second, if I could give the owner 6 stars, I would.  First time ever I've said that.  She's worth coming here alone.  She could tech new Disneyland recruits on customer service.  Lastly, tasty food at a cheap price.  If I could recommend one thing, it's the Shawarma sandwhich.  The best $6 you can spend in Phoenix.  I had the lamb, which was great.   In fact, I just may pick up about 10 of them and treat the office one of these days."}
{"text":"Great food, with lots of lamb options.  I really enjoyed the almond drink, too.  We are big fans!"}
{"text":"A wonderful Tunisian restaurant! The owners are very friendly and hospitable and the food is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"TUNISIAN HAS FINALY HIT PHOENIX and TUNISAN FOOD IS DELICIOUS FOOD!  *******HIDDEN*******GEM********ALERT****************  This is a very small basic restaurant that isn't fancy and also has a very limited menu. They serve mostly just a few chicken, few lamb, few vegetarian dishes and tuna.  I ordered the Chicken Mechoui. It was seasoned moist chunks of chicken breast and came with fresh baked to order pita bread and this extremely delicious vegetable side called Slata Mechouiya. When I first tasted the vegetable side I thought it might be too spicy for me but somehow almost like magic the spiciness takes a bake seat and it just turns delicious.  My husband had the house made lamb sausage plate called Ajja Merguez. It was also very delicious and was garnished with eggs and was served with harissa and fresh made to order pita bread.  The owner gave me a Tunisian Chicken Tajine to sample. It differed very much from Moroccan Tajines (that you can get next door at the Moroccan Restaurant) The Tunisian Tajine is more like a casserole. It tasted like something your mom might make if she was Tunisian.  You won't go wrong with the Chicken Mechoul or the Ajja Merguez!   The food was more delicious than I can describe you must try it if you can.  The owners were friendly and welcoming.  Portions are large and prices are low.  This is a soon to be discovered Hidden Gem!  4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Hands down best lamb I've had in Arizona. Great service, left feeling like I got a hug from my mom. Definitely will become a regular. Get the mint tea for a after dinner treat."}
{"text":"Really good food and service. Definitely a mom and pop shop you want to check out if you're close by."}
{"text":"Finally, from New York moved to AZ searched far and long, Habbouz Tunisian Cuisine was found! Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Food was exceptional.  I had the Couscous with lamb, hubby had the Ajja Merguez.  The merguez was the best I've had (raised on North African cuisine).  We had the Slata Mechouiya as well and it was also delicious.  We plan on returning again and again.  The warmth and friendliness of the server (also the owner) gives it a true \"tunisian\" experience."}
{"text":"Can't say anything more than AWESOOOOOME. really enjoyed the lamb shank. It was delicious and big portions. Tasty and fresh I can't say no more"}
{"text":"I didn't know anything about Tunisian food entering Habbouz but I left knowing that I like from this place. Seriously - go to the restaurant. The service is wonderful and, for my fellow Localists, it's a mom and pop operation where the Mrs makes the meals fresh right there on site. This is the kind of restaurant, in this Yelper's humble opinion, that should get community support.  We had the hummus, grilled chicken (I don't recall the menu name), and slata mechouiya. It was all so good. I regret that we only visited to snack because I would have loved to try even more of their menu -- though I definitely will in the future. The chicken was crisp on the outside and so juicy inside. We ended up taking some of the baked goods home as well. One was a little pistachio treat - unlike anything I'd had -- and some baklava, which was flaky and doughy.   Really, I just can't say enough good things. It's right off I-17 with plenty of parking. Bookmark it and hit it up. You'll agree with me."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place. The owner is the best and she now recommends dishes for me based on what she has seen me eat and like. Her mint tea is amazing and the coffee a perfect way to finish off the meal. My favorite is the Lamb Shank. Genuine authentic Arabic food"}
{"text":"This Tunisian restaurant has only been open for two months, and they already have attracted people coming as far as Sedona to try the cuisine. My friend and I saw this place on Yelp decided to stop for a quick dinner. With a casual, parsimonious décor, the small well-lit interior encompassed a row of booths and tables vertically arranged. Behind the glass counter were the colorful overhead menu, and there was a TV to keep everyone entertained.   The Slata Mechouiya ($5.99) appeared like a salsa with several olives stacked on top. The combination of grilled and grounded hot green pepper, tomato, garlic, onion, and olive oil was sensational. The olive oil rounded out the sharp edges, creating depth within the mix of savory and spicy flavors. It was refreshingly addictive, especially when accompanied by their homemade bread. Recommend it.  The star of the evening was the Ajja Merguez ($10.99). It was cooked with home made lamb sausages, harissa, egg, and green pepper. The small pieces of sausages carried full-on wow-factor on the first bite. The harissa added spice to the dish, and the cooked down green pepper was highly addictive, especially with the two sunny-side eggs designed to bring finesse to multitudes of pointed flavors. This is a must get for those searching for enlightenment.   The Couscous Lamb ($12.99) came with generous portions of couscous cooked perfectly to soak up the flavors from the hot green pepper, garbanzo beans, potato, and lamb shank. The portion could easily feed three, and the lamb shank was coming off the bone delicious.   As a hidden gem, the owners took pride in making everything from scratch. Service was warm, down to earth, and we had a great conversation at the end about the cuisine. This is an appropriate place for those looking to try a new cuisine for the first time, and for small groups and families searching for home-style dishes that are made with care. Bold, spicy, and delicious, I can't wait to come back to try the Chicken Tagine, Lamb Shawarma, and Lamb Mechoui."}
{"text":"Wonderfully sweet proprietor and great food. Highly recommended for those that deserve better than the bland \"ethnic\" food from the likes of pita jungle. The lamb is fantastic."}
{"text":"Habbouz Tunisian Cuisine 7816 N. 27th Avenue Phoenix  Sometimes we come across a gem in the rough, and this is Habbouz.  Companion and I arrived for a 5:45 dinner and were promptly seated. The rough part of this restaurant is that it is sparsely decorated and looks more like a little nook than a restaurant. It is located in a strip mall with a number of other ethnic places.  Companion started with a soft drink, and I ordered hot tea. The tea came in a small cup with a number of mint leaves in it. Not being the biggest fan of mint in the world, on a personal level I didn't care for the tea, and it was removed from our bill at the end.  The menu has a fair number of lamb dishes on it. Deciding on what to eat from such a delicious looking menu was difficult, but we both settled on the lamb shank. When places offer lamb shanks I usually order them as cooking them properly takes lots of time and seasoning them properly takes a good hand. With the exception of the lamb shanks which must be cooked in advance, everything else on the menu is cooked upon ordering. While this might take a little extra time, it is well worth it.  In short order, two beautiful plates of lamb shank were placed in front of us. The shank was nestled in a bed of what was perhaps the best couscous I have ever eaten. Also on the plate was a small salad with green olives in it that were wonderful. On the side, was a serviette of sauce to slather on the lamb and couscous. To say that this was delicious would be an understatement. The restaurant uses very little silverware, and gives patrons plastic ware to eat with. In truth, this is the real test of whether the meat is tender or not, as plastic is known for breaking on tough meat.  Touching the meat with the plastic fork resulted in it almost falling off the bone. Rich with flavor it was truly succulent. Some like their couscous dry, and some prefer it with more sauce on it. I ate it both ways and can honestly say it was wonderful either way you ate it. The portions on the plate were so large I was unable to finish the food. Companion took a doggy bag home.  We had an assortment of dessert items including some truly wonderful baklava that again, is made on the premises and was similar, yet different from any I had ever eaten before.  Companion also ordered a second meal just to take home for the next day. I noted that on the menu they sell merguez sausage. For those not familiar with this, it is a lamb sausage that is nice and spicy. Not with heat, but with flavor. It does have a small amount of berber seasoning in it which gives it just a tiny bit of heat. I ordered a portion of it to take home and it was excellent the next day.  Were this food to be served in any fancier place, it would be packed with patrons and would be a top pick for any food critic.  4 stars for friendly, excellent service, wonderful food, and a wonderful experience. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and very flavorful. It is a one woman show that does it all: * Receptionist * Server * Chef * Bus person * Cashier  Doing all the jobs with a warm smile and a sincere appreciation for her customers that comes to the restaurant/home."}
{"text":"Wow. Very glad we chose this restaurant for dinner. The owner is such a friendly person and really wants you to enjoy her food. She helped us choose a dish since neither of us have had Tunisian before. Both of us ended up ordering ajja merguez and green tea with mint for after our meal. Couldn't be happier with the choice! We also got a piece of their homemade baklava which was fantastic. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys trying new things and eating delicious food."}
{"text":"We will be back! We got the chicken schwarma and a sausage plate. Bold flavor,  moist meat,  everything fresh.  The owner\cook is very friendly and obviously very passionate about her food. For the hole in the wall area the place itself is very clean and inviting."}
{"text":"Their menu reads, \"The first and BEST Tunisian food in Phoenix,\" and I couldn't agree more! These are the most friendly people, too. So not only is the food a home run, but so is the service!   I decided to hit Habbouz after the gym. I was starving for something healthy, so I popped open my Yelp app and out came Habbouz in the results. With rave reviews already, I HAD to give it a shot. Also, bear in mind, yesterday was Memorial Day, so I knew it was a gamble whether or not they'd be open, but I took a chance.   The restaurant is in an unassuming little strip mall. Sometimes, these are the best places to find great food, and this certainly was the case. Being Memorial Day, the parking lot was rather empty, so I decided to call first and see if they were open. Lucky for me, they were.   It's a simple place. Clean, but not a lot of flashy decor, which is fine, as long as the food is good, which it was. I had the chicken mechoui; and boy, was it TAAAAAAY-STY! A little on the pricey side, but they give you A LOT for your money. I felt it was a good value since I was able to get two meals out of it. I'd probably have gotten three, but I just couldn't stop eating it! The chicken was so tender and juicy, I couldn't put my fork down.   The owner and chef was so nice. She gave me recommendations on what to try. The only critique I would offer is the menu could be a little more descriptive, since most folks probably have not had authentic Tunisian cuisine before. Other than that, this place is a keeper, and I will be back for sure....with friends!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Everything we had was delicious and the owner/chef/server was so hospitable and kind. I've never had Tunisian food before but this restaurant makes me want to go to Tunisia. Highlights were:  -lamb shank with cous cous: fall off the bone tender -ajja merguez: little sausages in an amazing red sauce -chicken mechoui: moist grilled chicken with some mystery spices   Oh and if the owner recommends something, take her up on it. We were going to get the hummus but she talked us into another appetizer and it might've been the best thing we had. Support this place!"}
{"text":"Wow  I have been to many Arab restaurants, this is a unique one, the only authentic Tunisian food restaurant in Phoenix.  The place is so clean, fresh white walls, and simple menu concept.  The chef is a Tunisian lady so you get a home cooked food just like if you were to visit Tunisia.  Mirgez (Tunisian sausage) is so flavorful, couscous is rich, I recommend to try their Tagin(Tunisian quiche) and their grilled salad.  They only cook with ViRgIn OLIVE OIL which is a hard to find practice at other restaurants.  Warm staff, food is made fresh right there and then with hardly any long wait time.  It felt like I went to someone's house :)  Don't ask me what the name means, I have no clue.  They sell Tunisian sweets also and they also look freshly made there.  This place is spotless clean like you are in someone's house. The level of cleanliness is unbelievable and hard to put in words, wait till you see it."}
{"text":"I went to Habbouz with the International Supper Club, not exactly knowing what 'Tunisian' food would be like. I ended up enjoying it very much! This is a no frills kind of restaurant, but the employees were friendly and helpful. The food is on the expensive side (14 ish $ for a plate), but the portions are quite large. I ordered the lamb with couscous, which was huge! The lamb literally fell off the bone.. it was super tender and tasty. It came with a roasted pepper of sorts and a ton of couscous. I tasted a couple of the other dishes - the kabab (very good, especially with their special salad) and the little sausage dish with the egg on top... now that sauce was incredible!  I asked if I could have that sauce with a different meat (not a huge sausage fan), and they said it wouldn't be a problem. I know what I'm getting next time! I will definitely be back!   PS I had leftovers for 3 more meals... they were not messing around with portions here."}
