{"text":"My first time here, the food was good i enjoyed it. The sushi was delicious. Customer service was nice as well. I would go there again."}
{"text":"Was iffy about coming here but after reading the reviews I decided to go in. The outside looked a little run down but when I walked inside it was like walking into a different building. The staff were nice and  accommodating. The food is sweet and not much variety in flavor. That was to be expected from a review I read however, it was good. The coconut shrimp was really good and also the orange chicken. I also tried the spicy chicken which was good. The crab puffs were very crispy which could be a good thing or bad depending on the person you ask. For me, it was to much of a bit. The desserts did not look that appetizing and a couple of them where not good at all. It's a hit and miss depending on what you get."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last Tuesday for lunch.  It took me a minute to realize some things had changed, like the name and the staff and the position of some of the items.  The new signs are funny, they used the \"i\" from \"city\"and moved it a bit to use it in Asia.  of course the \"i\" is faded and the three new letters are not.

This owner is going to try opening at 10:30 instead of 11:00 like the last one did for the first couple of months.  Getting there right after 11:00 all the trays were full and everything was the proper temp.  I wonder how long they can keep all the trays full with only the dozen or so folks that were eating without having food go bad.  They did have somebody tending the trays almost constantly.  I did notice one of the cake pieces was pretty well dried out but that may be enhanced with the heavy a/c this time of year.  Will have to wait and see how these folks do, the food and the price are right, they just need more customers."}
{"text":"Please avoid this place...the most horrible food ive ever tried and soo expensive! Almost threw up on my way out! Wongs place in tempe is the place to go! Real food!"}
{"text":"No matter how many times this place gets bought out, it remains roughly the same. People are always down for cheap, sugary faux Asian food, so when I review such a place, it's important to look at what makes it different. The WOW factor. I've found that while the selections are relatively small, they are above average quality. No, really, seafood for days. Load up on the coconut shrimp for sure. No regrets. Also, the orange chicken has less sugar and more spice than I'd expect. How is the Panda Express next door still in business? Here are a few more things to try: 

Crab puffs: Actual imitation crab! It's better than just cream cheese, I swear. 

Honey chicken: Legit AF. Gotta love something fresh off a grill

Mongolian grill station: I think this is only if you're dining in. Do it. Worth. 

What's *not* worth, however, is getting anything to go, which has been my vice lately. It costs $10 to do so, about the same as dining in. To make matters worse, they give you a tiny box! It's a ripoff compared to other buffets in the area, so I'm totally knocking off a star. 

Doesn't mean I won't come to stuff my face here again. :-x"}
{"text":"This buffet has a past-its-prime feel about it, and that includes the look and taste of most of the food too.  The front reception/cash register area was dirty and the seating behind it was strewn with dirty and tattered personal items. The carpeting in the dining room was beyond filthy and gave the whole place a decidedly dingy feel. The restaurant seemed to have ample staffing but everyone seemed to be running around looking stressed out and overwhelmed, except the young woman sitting at the hostess station who occasionally dozed off and seemed oblivious to everything going on around her.  The steam table food was the stereotypical Chinese-American style stuff with chicken-everything.  When we arrived at about 12:45, the restaurant was maybe at 20% capacity, yet many of the lunch buffet selections had been depleted and not refilled. Much of the food appeared to be from frozen/prepared products.  I opted for the stuffed crab and the small prawns; those weren't too bad I have to admit.  Overall, no return trip."}
{"text":"Bumping this place up to 5 stars. Came here on a Sunday about 2 pm and ordered takeout. They have takeout for the same price as dine in per box... so it was $10 for a box that to me seemed slightly smaller than most take out places. Filled it up with salmon, coconut salmon, baked catfish, a couple crab puffs, and a little bit of chicken as well as some noodles.  I also put a few pieces of sushi, some banana pudding pie and a mocha cake in there. The fish was pretty good, the shrimp was outstanding, the chicken was pretty good, the crab puffs were pretty good. This time the sushi really delicious and they figured out the dessert issue because the mocha cake actually was delicious and not dried out. The only thing that I can say against this place now would be the fact that it does charge per box as I prefer to keep my hot and cold food separate and the boxes are a little smaller than most places I go to. Most likely I will be back, though most likely will stick to eating in instead of take out. 

Basically all I'm saying is go and fill up on coconut shrimp and banana pudding pie."}
