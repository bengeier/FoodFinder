{"text":"Yum, yum and yum. One of the best I've had in a very long time. This is now the only Indian restaurant I will go to. Chicken tikka masala, paneer makni awesome. Lick your plate good. Can't wait to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome lunch special. It's a wicked feast. I'd move to Scarborough just for this. I got the palak paneer and chicken tikka masala lunch specials with a friend. Had plenty of sides and delicious goo to dip the hot fresh naan in. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The Lamb Korma I ordered was some of the best I've had in Toronto. I was suggested Lamb Vindaloo when I asked for my Lamb Korma extra spicy which was a really insightful suggestion. I loved the Korma though and I think I'll be sticking to it! :D  Thank you!   I will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Went with a couple friends with dietary restrictions (gluten, diary) and the waiter helped us pick various (delicious) dishes. Had six different entrees between four people and everything was so tasty and flavourful. My new favourite restaurant in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the neighbourhood. I have come here on several occasions and I have never had a bad experience. The food is top notch. At lunch they have a number of thali to choose from. Other good dishes include the Goan fish curry, tandoor mixed grill, and chicken vindaloo. I have included a picture of their vegetarian thali."}
{"text":"I was excited to see that an Indian restaurant was moving in to the old Hamish's space. A group of us neighbours went to check it out, and I've been back several times since. So good, my new favourite Indian restaurant, and in walking distance to boot! I've tried the curry shrimp with rice, curry fish with naan, and a paneer dish (don't remember which one). All were awesome. The samosas are good too. There are so many more dishes I want to try. Reasonable prices, friendly attentive service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We ordered a whole tandoori chicken, chicken biryani, aloo gabi and the naan is to die for!  Server was very friendly. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"I was craving indian food today and Lageez satisfied my hunger and then some.  I had the thali with butter chicken and my wife had a thali with chicken korma. There is a lot of food coming your way when you order one thali so be prepared.   I tried both dishes and they were both delicious. The naan was fresh and tasty. The lentils were a bit bland though.  While i was waiting for my meal the server was kind enough to offer a glass of water. To me that simple gesture went a long way."}
{"text":"This place just opened recently, we had to try it. We were so happy we did, the food was amazing! The prices are fair and the food quality and quantity is on point. I am sure there will be a time where it will get super busy here. It's a small little gem that is run well."}
{"text":"Went on a quiet Sunday afternoon and the experience was v nice. We had Tandoori Mixed Grill, Chicken kadhai, they were all flavorful. Their mint green chutney was v fresh n added to the overall taste. Naan was nicely buttered n soft. However the lachcha paratha was bit more crispier to my liking, cud have been less baked.  Overall good meal in Scarborough. They say they are busy on weekends evening, hoping the qualilty of food and service are as good."}
{"text":"Looking for good Indian food close to home and found this place on BlogTO's Best Indian Restaurants. Ordered take out Butter Chicken, vegetable biriyani, Dal Tadka, Onion Bhaji and the butter naan. The sauce for the butter chicken is delicious!  It's velvety and rich and flavourful.  The Dal Tadka was runnier than I was expecting but was well seasoned.  The onion bhaji was crunchy on the outside and dense but soft on the inside.  The naan was chewy and soft with a good tandoor oven toast on them. Portions were large enough to have left overs for another meal. The restaurant looked very clean and quite nicely decorated.  Will have to eat in another day. Our first impression of Lageez is extremely favourable. I no longer have to drive across the city to have great Indian food."}
{"text":"I ate here last Friday with my boyfriend for the second time. We had Vegetable Biryani, Butter Chicken, Lamb Vindaloo, and Samosas. The samosas were a little bland on their own but they had more flavour after putting some chutney on. The Biryani rice was a little too soft but the seasoning was good. I prefer rice that is slightly harder. I liked the butter chicken but there could have been more chicken. My boyfriend ate the lamb which he liked a lot. The service was good but we got the seat near the front door which is drafty and cold in the fall and winter. (One star was deducted for the draft. Half a star was deducted for the too soft rice and half a star for the lack of flavour for the samosa.) I suggest installing a divider or semi wall to reduce the draft coming in every time customers come in or leave. A heavy curtain could also block the draft. We got the table in the back the first time we came which is nice for quiet dates."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great place to get some indian food. Everything from the appetizers to the entrees was very tasty..good sized portions too.  The booze and food is very affordable. .making for a nice dinner out.  Saw lots of people coming in to pick up takeout. ..next time we will try the take out as well"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Best Indian Restaurant in Scarborough!!  Their Naans are shaped like giant tennis racquets!  Small but lovely atmosphere & good wine list. Great place for a small gathering or a date! I also do takeout a lot. They have some incredible lunch specials...they are huge and delicious."}
{"text":"*HALAL* As stated by owner!  A surprise in a dingy plaza...  Lunch special Thali - $11.99 - includes veg Appetizer, chicken tikka, chicken curry, veg curry, rice/salad, Naan AND dessert Gulab Jamun  -- the butter chicken was ACTUALLY good! What a surprise!  Second dish: Chicken Biryani - $12  - was good but not the greatest.   Looks like a shady place from the outside as it's in a random plaza but the Interior is surprisingly nice!!! Check them out on blogTO website as well!   Note: They do serve alcohol in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden  gem in a small plaza at the corner of St.Clair/ Pharmacy. Arrived on a quiet Friday night.  Service was excellent, and food was VERY fresh and flavorful. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Went there with my sisters after reading reviews and this place was good. We order chicken tikka platter (well done and portion size was good, a little bland for us). Chaat papri , decent price of $6 instead of $12 at gerrard India town. Chicken vindaloo was good but had potato pieces along chicken pieces so that was the first but delicious. Naan were fresh. In terms of service, it was little slow because there was only person running around serving all tables. In pictures the restaurant looks big and when you walk in , it starts and finishes no places to put strollers. Overall food was good was good, well made and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm so glad my friend found this place. Their Indian food is exceptionally delicious! We've been here twice already and usually order the lamb vindaloo - incredibly delicious but spiciness does build up! We ordered the paneer tikka masala and the chicken kadai as well which tasted very similiar (paneer was sweeter) so I would recommend not ordering those two sauces at the same time. The goat briyani was really nicely flavoured and slightly spicy.  The service isn't the best because we asked for water a few times and they forgot but I know it's hard when there's only two servers. The restaurant is small so try to come before/after the rush or make reservations. Would definitely return and try their other items."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Stopped here for lunch and ordered the Lamb Thali. The meat was tender and everything tasted fresh."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Just North of St. Clair in a strip plaza on Pharmacy. Outstanding Palak Paneer, amazing lamb rack tikka. The sauces, the biryanis, everything was amazing. The price is more than reasonable too."}
{"text":"I've been here for a sit down dinner with my family once and the 3 of us agreed that we will definitely be coming here again and again. The service is friendly, the food is authentic and the flavours are amazing. Every bite has a great flavour profile. We have been to many Indian restaurants but this place is the real deal. The naan was freshly made, the paneer was perfectly cooked, and all in great portion for the price. Must try!  Update: Double check your receipt if you're ordering online as the prices do not match. When I tried to take this up with the server I was met with sarcasm about my ability to pay. Unfortunately won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"La JEEEZZZ!  At first, I didn't know this was by St Clair and was rather reluctant to go (Note: I was fairly north in the GTA at this time). However, I ended up going anyways as I found it on a list of top South Asian restaurants.  The restaurant is quite small and can probably only hold 30 - 50 persons. The servers were very diligent and were quick to serve me.   I received a crispy, rolled roti-like appetizer that paired with two sauces. One was a spicy green one and the other was a sweet sauce. For my main, I got a curry dish consisting of spinach, garlic, spices and an Indian cheese similar to cottage cheese (paneer). This was thick and creamy.   Overall, I had a pleasant meal and service. There seemed to be a lot of people doing take-out, making me believe that this spot is a local favourite. Only recommendation I have was that there needs to be better ventilation because overtime, it felt very stuffy."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is so good. I went there for lunch had the mango salad and the butter chicken delicious! I absolutely loved it. Prices are great too. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Lageez! What a great lunch experience.  I can't remember the price but I think around $13 you can get a 3 course lunch. I got the spinach saag vegetarian lunch. There was an assortment of things to eat in my tray. Everything was TASTY. The pakora was actually my least favourite thing which is usually my favourite of things...!  The Naan was massive and there was rice too to get you full for the afternoon. We didn't finish the Naan because there was such a generous serving. The Gulab jamun dessert was pretty good too.  I would 100% go back for lunch again. The service was friendly and attentive, nothing more to say."}
{"text":"Quaint restaurant with dimmed lighting, textured walls and dark wood. I enjoyed looking at all the wonderful details that the owners and managers included in all aspects of the dining experience. Very cozy restaurant: a perfect place to bring your significant other for a date.   The host/waiter/interior decorator was very cordial and a wealth of information when it came to the menu and the restaurant. He brought us two pretty blue glasses and a chilled bottle of water. He smiled when I started taking pictures of the table setting and water. He mentioned that he ordered the glassware from Montreal and that the beautifully shaped blue glasses had bubbles intentionally imbedded in it: cool detail.   Complimentary papadum with accompanying cilantro/coriander and tamarind chutneys (dipping sauces) came out next. Made fresh every day, they were deliciously light and crispy.  We ordered the mix appetizer platter. When it came out I noticed the elegantly shaped plate that they came on. I delighted in trying out each savory appetizer and matching it with it's complementary chutney. The only bad thing with the appetizer was that the chicken pakora was overcooked and chewy, but it was still tasty.  The mains were a bit of a wait: but in the meantime, I was able to notice that the beautiful pendant lights above us were very slowly rotating: I was reminded to sit back, relax and enjoy this time with my hubby.   The  fish in the Goan fish curry was cooked perfectly: moist and tender. The chicken in the butter chicken was a little overdone but still delicious. The curries were both delectable (make sure to mix in the white sauce drizzled over the butter chicken, it makes a difference in taste) and I'm glad we had enough naan and rice to soak it all up. At the end of our meal, our server gave us hot towels (like the ones given out on select flights) to wipe off our hands: classy!  Delicious food, pleasing atmosphere and top notch service: yeah, were coming back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   Not only is all the food great, but the whole thali thing.... That's just top notch. Most Indian restaurants I go to near where I live serve every dish individually. So I either need to order tons (which I can't eat all of and is expensive)... Or I order a couple dishes and don't get variety. Which is fine... But it's better as a thali! A thali (I think) is a small platter style of serving.   For me it's the best way to enjoy Indian food because I can have so much variety, with just a small portion of everything. Pakora, Palak paneer, Chicken tikka, naan, some rice, dessert and more... All for like $12 or something.   And it's all phenomenal. It's far from where I live, but I think I'll make excuses to go to that neck of the woods whenever possible just to eat here."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after seeing it reviewed on BlogTO.  Really great food -- we had the Lamb Vindaloo and Palak Paneer.  The garlic naan was on point.  The mango lassi was tasty.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So delicious Indian food. The flavour is strong and special in each dish. I strongly recommend this restaurant if you want to try real Indian food."}
{"text":"A nice surprise.   Food :The food is very good. We tried mostly the veggie options there and it was terrific. The pakoras are yummy and go very well with the corn soup. The mixed veg korma, daaal maakhi, malai kofta is very good. Very tasty as compared to some of the other restaurants I have been to. Ambience: it's  a small place but maintained quite well. I think their focus is mostly on Take Outs but they have settings for people to come and dine.  Service: nice bunch of guys serving. There's a young lad called Sachin who is very prompt and energetic.  Cleanliness:Nice and clean although washrooms are located downstairs - was a problem for my elderly parents.  Differentiator: They also offer you a hand towel after you eat the Indian food. I hope they keep doing that as I loved it. Overall a great place."}
{"text":"I was super excited when I saw a new Indian restaurant had opened where Hamish Fish and Chips used to be on Pharmacy, just north of St. Clair.  My excitement only increased when my neighbours had a chance to try it before I did. He is a former professional chef and she was born and raised in India. They both raved about it, and said it was as good as any food they'd had in India. Although I've never been to India myself, I trust their opinion.  I have eaten a lot of Indian food from a lot of different restaurants, and Lageez is definitely the best Indian food I've ever had. We ordered the mixed vegetable appetizers, butter chicken (of course), chicken Tikka masala, spinach and paneer, naan, and rice. Everything was incredible. We all sat at the table closing our eyes and moaning with every bite. English doesn't have a word for eating past the point of being full just because the food tastes good, but we need one. Because that's how I feel right now.  Please, everyone go to Lageez, because I have now made it my personal mission to make sure this new Indian restaurant stays in business for a very long, long  time to come."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Ordered the butter chicken and Goan fish curry, and it was so yum. The chat papri was good, but it came warm which is different than most chats. We ordered the lamb seek kebab because people said the lamb was good, but no one said which lamb. The seek kebab was dry but still good. Would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food in generous portions at a good price; friendly competent staff; lots of parking. Have dined-in as well as take-out several times. Consistently excellent."}
{"text":"Spectacular Indian food, not sure why it's taken so long to review the restaurant. My 9 an 11 year old children would rather have Indian over pizza so that says so much, and the freshly made Naan is out of this world.  Our family sometimes orders like 10+ Naan when guests come over to use them with dips and such. So happy the owners moved into our neighborhood."}
{"text":"I was surprised by this place because of its food quality, price and taste. I was deterred from entering this place for while because of its not so desirable store front etc. However, they have the best Indian food in Toronto! I tried many places before at Yorkville, Bloor West, downtown etc....  The lunch special wrap is the best!"}
{"text":"Good food!   We had chicken briyani, chicken platter, mango lassi, and pharata.  Size was just right.  The briyani stood out!  Chicken was moist.  Pharata was cold, but tasty.  We will definitely order from this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Cozy place to eat Indian food. We ordered chicken korma and half tandoori chicken. The korma was very rich and the chicken was tender. The tandoori chicken came to our table smoking hot on a sizzling plate; deep smoky flavour. Decently priced and service was good. Washroom was clean, hot water was functional +1.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"As an Indian who has access to delicious homemade Indian food, my standards for Indian food at restaurants are extremely high. And let me tell you, Lageez met my expectations and then some.   We ordered the tandoori grill plate, the tandoori shrimp, the butter chicken, and lamb korma. Everything was excellent. The shrimp in particular was noteworthy - they were huge, juicy, and extremely flavourful! The portion sizes are very generous, and the accompanying naan was fresh and HUGE. Even the regular ol rice was cumin scented and delicious! It's definitely one of the best Indian restaurants in the city and excellent value to boot. I look forward to returning and trying more items on their menu."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Went there looking at Yelp reviews but the food was pathetic. We ordered the chaat papri, mixed chicken platter and hot & sour soup. The chaat was overly sweet and full of brown sweet chutney. The chicken marination had no taste. The hot and sour soup was too bland - we had to add vinegar & chillies to it and then all we could taste was vinegar & chilly. Although the staff was courteous and offered us 10% discount for the next visit - we were not happy to hear that they had been busy the whole day delivering a big order outside and hence, they couldn't live upto our expectations. That is not something customers should have to put up with."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner, without any reservation. Had some veggie appetizer platter and a chicken curry for main course, along with some salad. If this restaurant would be in a more central location, it would probably easily become a top 3 Indian restaurant in Toronto. The quality of food exceeded most of the high rated restaurants downtown, the prices are unbeatable. Even for drinks. Never have I seen a restaurant with a decent selection of wines sold at almost same price in LCBO. They usually double/triple it. Not here.  Service also very good, pretty quick and nice server.  The space is a bit small and cozy and could be a bit more improved in terms of atmosphere (some Indian music maybe rather than music you typically hear when on hold with a service center) and a bit on cleanliness (the menu was having dried up curry on multiple pages, as well as sticky).  But all in all yet to find something better in Toronto if not GTA."}
{"text":"Picked up delicious Indian take out in the most unexpected location!  Lageez at Pharmacy and St. Clair.    The food was delicious and ready on time, prices were quite reasonable, especially considering the quality, and they have hubby's favourite Okra dish, and do it the best of all the places we have tried.  The butter chicken was not too sweet, a relief since so many other places make it too sweet.  The lamb was really tender, my favourite.  After trying take out places in Scarborough, and Gerrard Street, and never finding \"the one\", Lageez is the winner.  Might try dining in next time, but it is great having a reliable place for take out.    Don't let the tiny residential plaza fool you, just walk in and the delicious smell of the food will tell you, that you've arrived!"}
{"text":"Lageez is a little gem in Scarborough for authentic Indian cuisine.   The restaurant is clean, cozy with classy decor. Although it is small but they can accommodate a big group at the back of the dining hall.   Service was quick and polite.   We enjoyed all the dishes we ordered - tandoori sampler, butter chicken and Kadai Lamb. The portion was generous. Food was well use with spices and flavourful.   We will definitely go back for more Indian food."}
{"text":"This place was nothing short of phenomenal. I hadn't had lamb in years, and I was hesitant when I ordered it. The tandoori platter/combo just sounded so delicious. It was such a good call!! The lamb was so tender and the paneer was amazing.  The service was super nice as well. We will be back here asap.   The prices are also super super reasonable!"}
{"text":"DOUBLE CHECK YOUR TOTAL!! We ordered soup, veg samosa, onion bahji, chat papari, tandoori shrimp, mutter paneer, garlic naan and tandoori roti on May 6th. Total was $59.88. When we got to the restaurant to pick up our food total was $10 more than advertised. Worst of all the cashier admitted their online prices have been wrong for two years!!!!! un acceptable. Nothing was done and we were forced to walk away as I only brought $65 in cash. Worst service, wasted gas, time and he would not adjust the price to reflect their online menu."}
{"text":"Ordered through Just Eat. Came on time. Excellent chat papdi, lamb chops and naan! It's the real thing, and likely the best chat I've had in toronto so far. Now I've overeaten"}
{"text":"Good food. Ordered Palak paneer, Aloo gobi! , and daal makhani. Large portions when I ordered takeout and the place looks better on the inside"}
{"text":"Really good Indian food! For a small strip mall location, in somewhat of a run down area, fairly nice restaurant. We had the Butter Chicken, Chicken Biryani and Lamb Vindaloo. All dishes were very good, large portions and prepared fresh. The naan bread was delicious. Gave 4 stars for slow service, there was only one person out front, but there was only one other small table occupied. Still waiter was friendly, just seemed to take excessively long to take order, bring drinks and deliver bill at end. Will go back, leaning to takeout."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Had takeout once, ate in once.  Everything seemed to be made with care, the mulligatawny soup the best I've had, thick as opposed to brothy.  Excellent veggie choices, and reasonably priced.  The service was outstanding both times."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian restaurant with amazing food and service (esp Bala). Must try - chat papri, tandoori mix grill, lamb vindaloo, and tandoor cooked shrimp masala! A true gem in our neighbourhood :D"}
{"text":"Great spot. Had the pakoras to start. Delish. Tried the chicken tikka Marsala and hubs got the goat curry. So good. Food was hot and fresh. Would go back. For two people and no drinks with tip $47."}
{"text":"This place is that good. Food is 5stars. Service is 3 stars....so I gave 4 stars. I am not going give you too many details here but try this place if you want authentic Punjabi food. This is not cheap, but worth it."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for Family day based on yelp reviews. The interior was beautiful, it was like a hidden gem because on the outside it didn't look like much!  We ordered the non-veg mixed appetizer. It came with a samosa, fish, potato and onion cutlet. My most favourite from this platter was the fish! Definetly will be ordering the fish individually as an apetizer next time!  For the main, we wanted to try a bit of everything that looked good. We ordered the chicken bruiyani, butter chicken, chicken vidaloo, butter naan and chicken kabob. The chicken bruiyani and the chicken vidaloo stood out! The chicken bruiyani was very good with the right amount of spice and flavour! The chicken vidaloo had a hint of sour and it was so flavourful. The butter chicken was really good too! Didn't taste too much like tomatoes like in other indisn restaraunts and i loved that! The butter naan was nice and soft and very buttery! Lastly, the chicken kabob was the only item that was a miss today. It was very tough and tasted like sausage, it said it has cottage cheese but I didn't taste it and it was nowhere to be found. The only thing good about it was the presentation. All the portions were plentiful, for the 4 of us we had to take leftovers home for all the dishes!  Lastly for dessert we ordered the pistachio kulfi! This was a nice ending to our heavy fulfilling meal! It had the right amount of sweetness, it was very good! I just don't get why they put so much rose water, not a big fan of rose water! We also had the mango lassie which had a strong flavour of rose watet so it was not a favourite. Overall a great experience with great food and freat customer service as it was packed and there was only on waiter and he did a great job, definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is destined to be a neighbourhood gem. The food is delicious. Freshly made and flavourful. Good quality ingredients. Staff very friendly. We've only tried the takeaway, and looking forward to dining in."}
{"text":"This place is located in a quite neighbourhood. I tried the Papdi chat . It was crunchy, spicy and tangy. Then we got the Chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan . The curry was delicious with the right blend of spices . The service was pretty decent and would  give them a 3.5 ."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times since it opened and everything is top notch; the quality of the food, the serving sizes, and the attentive staff. And the prices are as good as I've seen. I have tried 6 or 7 different appetizers, 3 or 4 kinds of bread and 4 or 5 of the mains. I would rank this as my favourite Indian restaurant and I have eaten at dozens of Indian restaurants in Toronto, Kitchener, Waterloo, Boston, New York, London (Ontario and England) as well a India."}
