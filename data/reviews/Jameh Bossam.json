{"text":"Food is okay.  Service is quite horrible (servers are never there and food serving is really slow). Prices is reasonable compared to other Korean restaurant.  Quite disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"bad serivce...waitresses more interested in drinking and talking to their friends and guys picking them up ...do NOT come to this shit  place...period"}
{"text":"Food - 3.5/5 Service - 2/5  They specialize in Pork Belly.  Pretty good but expensive for what you get.  The 4 of us shared the $80 combo and I personally was not full compared to something I've had similar in price at other Korean establishments.    Decor is nice - very dark but goes with the theme and atmosphere.  Service was slow and had to ask for the same things multiple times.  They also do not serve unlimited banchan (side dishes).  They made an exception to refill us once and it was only for 2 of the side dishes.  Never have I experienced a Korean restaurant that was so tight about this.  The waitress did say that she wished she could give us more but isn't allowed.  Korean restaurants are known for unlimited banchan and their generosity like complimentary dishes on the house so we thought it was weird.  Probably won't return again unless going with a group."}
{"text":"Poor, The worst store ever!!!! Awful customer service. Me and my friend were waiting 2and half hour they made mistakes about customers number list. ), and we didn't get enough feedback!  the waiters just looking at us and didn't much give enough service !!  to laugh music. so I can't communicate with friends and waiters.  food was alright, but that means is 'good' or 'delicious'! worst experience ever. never go back in here! anymore!  we are so disappointed. and I cannot recommend here forever.  If i can give  '  - 0 stars' i would like to do. !!!!!!!! you have to be shame."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem located near Yonge and Sheppard. Such a great environment and different from what I am normally used to when it comes to Korean restaurants.   The bossam is delicious! the pork belly isn't dry at all and it isnt fatty. This is served with lettuce, garlic, onion, kimchi, jalapeno peppers and sauce. If you need more of the ingredients, you can ask for more without extra charge.    I really liked the budae hotpot but I might be bias because I love HOTPOT. This comes with instant noodles, spam (mmmm), enoki mushroom, sausage, and more but I cant remember everything in it right now.   I tried the seafood pancake and it was just mediocre. It comes in a very large portion so if you have a lot of food already, I wouldn't recommend. I would probably just opt out of this regardless, it isn't anything special.   They have a good variety of beer, sake and soju.   The banana soju was AMAZING. I will order this every time i visit. Although, I tend to really like banana flavored stuff. It also comes in a peach flavor that is a good too. Bad part? it is only 4% alcohol haha  This place a little pricier than your typical Korean restaurant but I would still recommend this place for a casual night out!"}
{"text":"This place is super busy. It's quite a shame me being Korean and all. I'm quite convinced that the owner of this establishment limits their staff for how many refills of side dishes can be served. The main dish bossam comes with some pickled cabbage. The pork to cabbage ratio does not consist of a great experience. Had to ask 3 times for a cabbage. Observed the staff, they're more than capable, I can only conclude that the ownership has limited the typical Korean expectations of refills of side dishes. I've been very encouraged by recent investments that have been unprecedented in Korean restaurants, but the short changing of service representing my culture has been a disappointing at this establishment. I'm personally very sad, we've come so far but just an arms length short."}
{"text":"Jameh is the newest Korean drinking spot in North York. It is basically a sojubang / pork belly restaurant.  If you are looking for a party atmosphere with nice lighting and lots of noise, this is the place. Eating here made me feel as though I was transported to Sinsa-dong. :-)"}
{"text":"Liked the rice cakes and kimchi seafood pancake a lot. Food is very tasty! Even the side dishes were delicious"}
{"text":"4 stars for the rice cakes :D   Recommended by a friend, I decided to try this place on a Friday night with my boyfriend. Around 6pm it was pretty empty but shortly after, it got busy and the restaurant was filled. Menu was not posted online so I took a couple of photos (Check out the photos).   We decided on ordering the Cheesy Spicy Rice Cakes (15.99$) and the Pork Hock (M) (17.99$).  Loved the rice cakes! It was just the right amount of spice and the rice cakes were cooked perfectly. This has to be one of the best spicy rice cakes I've had in awhile.   Pork Hock (M), I've never tried before but we decided to try it out. The ingredients were fresh and the romaine lettuce was crisp/fresh as well. It was tasty and I especially loved the combination of the garlic and jalape√±o peppers.   Overall, price wise I think it's more expensive than a typical Korean restaurant but it's worth it. Service is average and when it gets busy it's hard to get their attention. Beer selection is limited for draft but they have a decent choice of beer in bottles.   I would come back and try out the other dishes as they had a variety of food to choose from."}
{"text":"Jameh Bossam is delicious! It's a bit on the costly side but it's so so good! The servers aren't very attentive but they are helpful and nice once you get their attention.   Their spicy dishes are a bit too spicy for my liking but I love the bossam . We tend to always get combo A or B & it comes with army soup & delicious seafood pancake.   Bonus: they now have grape flavoured soju! It tastes like candy heaven. *caution* doesn't taste like alcohol & can be dangerous haha!"}
{"text":"Hidden little gem on spring garden!  Was bat hopping with some friends and hopped from finch to shepherd..   Decided to walk into this street and this was the only place open..  But the place was packed with lots of ppl having fun! Lots of cute single Korean girls too!  Beer menu was great!! Even had local brewer beers and sake and soju on the menu..  We didn't have any food, but the place smelled great!  Would definitely come back for dinner next week! Already made plans with the waitress..  All the staff were really friendly and we are not Korean."}
{"text":"Food was decent.  Just way overpriced for what you get.  Decorated like its trying to be hip.  Older people needed to use the flashlight app to see the menu as the coolness of the venue interferes light bulbs being fully lit .  For some reason the lights would occasionally dim and become brighter and back and forth at random times.  Super annoying."}
{"text":"Love the place, they are known for their bossam and it does live up to the standard. I always have to ask for more lettuce and sauce because they go so well with the steamed pork belly. I do prefer the pork belly than the pork hoc because pork hoc is already marinated and i dont think it goes well with the dipping sauce. But it still tastes amazing by itself. Side dishes here are a plus but i believe they don't do refill. Besides bossam, their kimchi jjigae is freakin good. Broth is not watery, their kimchi is brined enough so it feels like they put cheese inside the soup which they don't. Because it has that fermented/aged taste. Atmosphere is nice, warm cozy with dim yellow lights, perfect for drinks as well. On a pricier side for the portion but i love to have good meal so i don't mind coming back."}
{"text":"We ordered the Half & Half which consisted of pork hock and bossam (sliced pork belly). It was served atop a bed of lettuce with kimchi, jalapenos, and garlic slices. We also ordered some rice on the side to accompany the meats.  They brought out several small plates of banchan which I always loved eating. Among the side dishes I loved the fried tofu the most. It was still hot and the skin was so crispy.  The meat could be enjoyed as a lettuce wrap dipped in the sauce they provided or simply with some rice. It was a really delicious dish that could somehow be seen as the healthier option to Korean BBQ (my logic: boiled meat is healthier).   Service here was great as the server was really nice and gave us refills on our banchan. I did find it quite difficult to talk with my friend since the music started getting really loud as the evening went on."}
