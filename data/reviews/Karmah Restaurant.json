{"text":"Stop by after hearing there was a new vegan restaurant in the area....it took me a bit since I always feel like I have to stop in Toronto for plant based fast food.    The decor was nice and the owner was lovely.  I was in search of a sweet treat after lunch and I was generously given a tour of what foods they had to offer....my eyes were strictly on the desserts this visit. ...and there will be more visits lol  I settled on a slice of cheesecake because I was explained to that their brownies are their top seller and were sold out...next time!!  The slice will run you around $10  and was pretty small but tasty,  I found it to need a bit of  tartnes for my taste buds like drizzle or something on top would have been nice other then a slice of strawberry.  All in all it was a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"After trying a few vegan places in the suburbs, I stopped by to grab a quick dinner the other night, I have to say the selection of salads (that remind me of a small/medium salad size) were pretty expensive (10-13 dollars) concidering their size and content (half lettuce or rice).  I opted for their hot dish which was a chili.  Nothing I couldn't make at home myself.  The price tag was a little easier to digest at 6.99 for a small bowl.  I wanted to finish with a slice of cheesecake but the $8.99 price tag deterred me. I think if the food was worth the price I wouldn't mind paying this, but I just found this too expensive for what I got (and what my friends god, we went home and made more food because we were still hungry after)."}
{"text":"Had some chai latte and a parfait which was a pleasant surprise since I haven't had dairy free parfaits before!   I first thought the parfait would be too sweet but surprisingly, the dark chocolate flavoured chia and coconut whip were not as sweet as I thought and it was perfect! Really love this location.   My mother had a cheesecake with some apples and nuts and whipped coconut cream on top. She loved it and finished the whole thing which she rarely does. So it's a good sign lol.  Overall I do agree with the price being a bit more than regular typical cakes or parfaits but considering the healthy ingredients I don't mind coming back here again!  The decor is nice and very relaxing.  very friendly staff as well!  Looking forward to trying their vegan pizza next time :)"}
{"text":"They had run out of food at 3PM....the owner was a little cold and not as apologetic as she should have been for having an open restaurant with no food. At that point, it wasn't even a restaurant, it was more of a room with seating and an empty fridge."}
