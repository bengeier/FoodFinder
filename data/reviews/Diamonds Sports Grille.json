{"text":"Hey Diamonds here is a clue I would think most of your customers are baseball fans let alone cubbie fans .. so why would you be understaffed durning the World Series. ? Thank God for the waitress who was useless and slower then hell for passing off our table to another waiter. 4 thumbs down to her.. not sure how she forgot to put my order in for dinner when 20 feet from kitchen. Hell we had to flag down another one for drinks too. 4 thumbs up for Pepe? If I'm saying his name right. The guy hustled like crazy to serve our table 12 not to mention a few more tables in our area. He even took time out to chat as he worked. 
Gotta be honest if we had the first waitress any longer we were getting ready to walk. Hats off to him. 
Will we be back for tomorrow nights game  I doubt it and that party should be close to 15 of us from Chicago ... 
poor management .. you think  they would be staffed to handle"}
{"text":"We have been going to this sports bar on Sundays for 2 yrs and have always been VERY impressed with our waiter, Epi. He is attentive and has the drive & hustle of any football player that's up on the screen. Apart from the tortilla  chips, which lack salt, the food is great...our compliments to the cook!
Now we've learned that Epi has been given far fewer tables & might be going, but not by his choice.  Football is our 1st reason for coming to Diamonds, Epi is the 2nd.  We hope that management will reconsider and listen to their customers. Those that we've spoken to, as well as the bartender, agree that Epi is an asset and it would be a shame if he left. There are plenty of sports bars with good food, but it's hard to find really good waiters like Epi."}
{"text":"First time here. Met my wife and some friends. The waitress was rude and told us we couldn't split checks. I went to the bar to get my drinks for that reason. Not impressed overall."}
{"text":"Horrible service to start. After sitting for a half hour  I had to get up and walk over to kitchen area to ask a server if I should leave. We had a party of 6 who were hungry and wanted to have some drinks to watch the game. There was no apology for the delay. The menu was limited the waitress failed to write down the order and had to come back twice to get the orders correctly. 
I had been to this place years back when it was Steve and Harrys and it was great.
The food and service were poor but there was a decent classic rock band playing."}
{"text":"I would never go to this place. Service sucks. Bartender has the personality of a piece of wood. Outdoor area isn't dog friendly, because the manager said so! I would go to a Circle K and buy beer before going in this dump again."}
{"text":"This place is my Cheers (young people look it up)! I work in the area and stop by 3-4 times a week.  The food is better then average bar food and the drink prices are downright awesome!  The staff is very friendly and works hard to make your experience enjoyable! There are also 15 large flat screens making this a great place to watch any game!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch football on Sunday.  Ordered a Patty Melt and it was delicious. Food was very fresh and fries were crispy ie just perfect. Watched the Grey Cup from Canada.  Had fun and would go back . Staff was attentive and friendly checking our table often"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 12 years.  6 of them as Diamond. This is the cleanest, most sanitary, place I've been to in my life!!!"}
{"text":"The waitresses have been super friendly but the bartender Britney needs to be fired. She yells at customers and takes any request as an inconvenience.  Customer service is not in her wheel house. Trying to get a change of channel is like parting the red sea.  Please help!!!"}
{"text":"If you are staying at the Marriott, this is the only bar/grill within walking distance.  The cost of food and beer is 50% less than the hotel restaurant.  They have five beers on tap, twelve big screen TV, excellent wings, kids menu (kids at the bar) and good service.  We did not experience the poor customer service that other patrons experienced.  They treated us well.  We gave them a three star because of what we saw at the end of our night - Buckeye vs Ducks half time.  A waitress (not out waitress) allowed a patron who was 20 years older to kiss her shoulders and arm.  She ended her shifts and headed out as the man followed her like a puppy.  It looked like a transaction was about to happen.  We finished the game at the hotel."}
{"text":"The food is well below average, service is ok. Been here many times (only because it's across from the Marriott) only fun is the owner on the place gets blasted at the end of the bar and makes a fool out of himself"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch one day while riding around.  Atmosphere is great and our waitress was sassy, sarcastic and full of pi$$ and vinegar....we loved her!  Lots of TV's.  I had the hot wings.  They were real good.  Not very spicy but they were still good.  My wife had a cheese burger and fries.  She said the fries were good but the burger looked and tasted like a pre-pressed frozen patty and was somewhat tasteless.  My friend had the chili burger.  He said that it was ok.  Nothing real special.  I would go back but just not order the burgers."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly and prices are very good. Plus it is a Cubs bar!! Watched a couple of the playoff games there as well as part of the world series. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Okay place for a late drink social.  Right across from Marriott Hotel and within walking distance within Downtown Mesa.  This is the first and only sports bar I visited that sells Arizona Lotteries, very unique."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It has good TVs and nice, fast bartenders.  Food is average bar fare.  But the best part is that they have the AZ Lottery!  I love love love being able to play scratchers at the bar."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. Onion rings are especially good. Try the classic burger!"}
{"text":"March 4 2016. Home opener for spring game for Cubs spring training. Emy was bartender and my server. Always new what I wanted and they even had a free shuttle to game. Had the honey hot wings and they were good. Excellent service and very much would recommend!"}
{"text":"By 11am this place was packed today.  People drinking and eating breakfast like I have never seen.  The place is small and clean but it gets really noisy.   the seating is pretty spartan.

My friend had the BLT which the waitress said was \"awesome\" and he really liked it.  I had the burger which was decent.  The fries a cripsy (frozen fries obviously).  The iced tea tasted mostly of tap water.  

The place was understaffed this morning by the staff, which was older, was also spunky.  they were funny and did a good job.  The place seems to have busses running to spring training games."}
{"text":"Bartenders can pour one hell of a drink! Friday fish fry and if there's a hockey game being played, it's on the tv. Love this bar"}
{"text":"Service sucks bartender was more worried about the ole peebag she must have been dating. Girl had a cold with service like she had they would have been better off sending her home"}
{"text":"We've been coming to Diamonds for years, even before it was Diamonds, for spring training and have always had good service, good food and a great time.  It's right across the street from the Marriott where we stay.

They have a free shuttle to Cubs spring training games.  We have met people from all over the country, some who have become our friends because we all come to spring training at the same time.

With all the TVs it's a fun place to watch NCAA basketball tournament."}
{"text":"RACIST BAR!!! DO NOT COME HERE!!! My family was in town for a wedding. We are staying at the Marriott and decided to check out this bar across the street. The service sucked! The \"Bartender\" had the worst attitude! Apparently her creep boyfriend was sitting next to me at the bar and that POS started spewing racist comments to me. The staff had the audacity to kick us out. Racist patrons and racist staff! Despicable!"}
{"text":"Great place to go. The food is great as well is the service that the employees provide even the owner is involved and loves to help. I have been to many sports bars, but this by far is the best. They have so many Tvs there isn't a bad seat to sit in , and the environment is very friendly. You could take your girl friend, go out with the guys or simply go by yourself and make a new friend. Highly recommended this place."}
{"text":"We ate here twice- it is right across the street from the Marriott, so it is very convenient. It's very, very loud in the bar, but you can eat outside and it was very pleasant in the evening. Beer is their specialty- I ordered a margarita which was made with orange juice - it simply wasn't a margarita. The fish and chips, shrimp basket, and burgers are good: no complaints. The service was good and pleasant. If you like burgers, fries, and beer - this is the place."}
{"text":"Service has improved!  Better selection of IPAs and Pale Ales on tap now.  Bartender really terrific and did not care how slow I was with selecting my beer.  Had the grilled wings which were fried and then grilled and too dry.  Stick with the burger next time.  Someone next to me had a fried steak and enjoyed it - I did not know they even fried steaks.  Good local crowd.  Pub food with friendly service."}
{"text":"Oddly enough, it was a negative Yelp review that drew me to Diamond's in the first place (a review I see is no longer on Yelp). But after putting up with crappy service just to get the Sourdough burger I love, the argument with a man who was either the GM or the owner about whether a service dog could come in his bar was the last straw. 

I'm not sure why he thinks he can refuse service to someone coming in with a service dog, but that was the last straw for me. 

I will miss the Sourdough Burger, but trust me when I suggest you find a nicer place and ask them to make a Sourdough burger (on sourdough bread with grilled onions and cheese)."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I have ever experienced!  Seated ourselves at the high tops near the bar and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  The bartender noticed us walk in and sit down but did not bother to tell their what seemed to be, only waitress that new customers came in.  About 15-20 min of waiting, another 2 parties walked in.  The waitress acknowledged them and said she would be right with them.  As she was taking the menu's to them, I stopped her and politely asked for a menu and she said it was for the other table.  Politely again, I told her that we came into the establishment about 15 min before they did.  She asked me in a rude tone, \"well how do I know you are telling the truth?  You could have waved at me\".  I told her I assumed the bartender would have notified her and I wasn't aware she was the waitress because I didn't see her on the floor and when I did see her she did not have a name tag or apron, I thought she was a customer.  She says \"well when did you figure out I was the waitress?\"  I said \"when I heard you tell the other table you would be right with them\".  Her next words were \"well what do you want to drink?\"  I told her \"a simple 'I'm sorry' would have sufficed and she was the rudest and most unprofessional waitress I have ever encountered\".  She huffed and puffed and walked away as I grabbed my belongings and walked out.  I will never set foot in there again!"}
{"text":"What is this place, a supper club? Looks like a bar for regulars. Only had a couple drinks, didn't try the food. Im sure theres some type of fish fry here."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here for both lunch and dinner. To be honest, we didn't have high expectations for this place. As we understood it, it was just a dive bar. We were pleasantly surprised by our experience. We've been a few times now, and each time we've had Ariah as our server. Great server. She is incredibly attentive and is genuine when asking how everything is. The food has been really good every time. (LOVE the fajitas.) And the atmosphere is fun too. (We've been during sports games.) 
Also, kudos to the whole staff. As a former and current restaurant employee, we pay attention to service and what staff is doing when we are out to eat. Every time we've been we notice the staff working as a team running food, bussing tables... and the cooks always look like they're busting their ass. This has quickly become a favorite place of ours. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I visited this bar after a concert on Wednesday night, at mesa amphitheatre. We walked in browsed the menu saw that they had nachos and asked the bartender if they had chicken nachos, she said yes. So we ordered the chicken nachos. When the nachos came I ate a few bites and noticed there was beef on the nachos. When the bartender walked by I asked if they were chicken nachos and she responded \"they're chicken\" and walked away. So I looked again at my nachos and decided I would take some of the beef off and put it on a little side plate so I could show her it was beef. When I showed her she very very rudely explained that all the nachos came with chili and then they add chicken. When she looked at my plate she even commented that there wasn't much chicken, actually she could only point out one piece. She briskly walked away like she could give a shit less that we weren't satisfied with our food. Mind you, I've been a bartender and a server for 15 years so seeing another hospitality professional being so grossly disrespectful and rude blew my mind! I have never in my life witnessed anything like this! I was completely disgusted!! 

So I pushed my plate to the front of the bar and told her I didn't want the nachos. She grabbed the nachos off the bar and told me \"that's fine, you need to pay your tab and get out\". At this point I've eaten maybe 5 bites of these nachos. So I look at her and tell her I'm not paying for nachos I didn't eat. Then she says \"you almost ate them all\". I am fuming at this point! I cannot believe a grown woman is acting like this!! She walks past me again and I have the tab in my hand and she rips it out of my hand and says \"just get out\" then she says \"I'm calling the cops\". Go right ahead lady call the whole squad!!! At this point I'm flabbergasted at how this chick is handling a guest complaint! Are you serious? Calling the cops?? So the cops come ask me what happens I tell them and they tell me I'm free to go! What a joke this chick is! I've never been here before but from this experience I don't think I'll ever be back and I'd encourage everyone to steer clear!"}
{"text":"Have to complain that I couldn't get food at 10pm on a Thursday or Friday night, after work that kept me late. The place, right across the street from my hotel, had plenty of business, especially Friday night, and I'd imagine they could sell food of some sort if they wanted to."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I am a regular at this location....but with reason, the service is great and the food is better than most for bar food, they do have a flair when it comes to customer service, the employees are fantastic."}
{"text":"No Mexicans in here! 
Don't go here if you're Mexican, they don't like that; at least according to the barman that yield that at us on 1/14/17.
\"We don't let Mexicans in here\" she said after she shutter off the bar and the jukebox without any \"last-call heads up and  we complained about it."}
{"text":"Not sure why people rip this place. It is a cool little place with a good vibe. I am not sure I understand the whole Chicago in the desert, but it works. Antoinette, the bartender, was amazing, fast and attentive. It is obvious She is well received as a locals' favorite, so that is cool too. Great prices drinks and food for the Mesa area. We saw this place on the way to the Marriott. 

The Texas burger was fantastic. Green chilies on toast as a bun is a cool touch. The chips and cheese were cool too. Simple. Chips, melted cheese, side of salsa. Exactly as stated. No extra crap, just what we ordered. 

As we went to grab a late dinner at the Marriott and saw their prices for similar fare, it was an easy choice to walk across the street. Not to mention, we stood in the doorway of the Marriott restaurant for at leader minutes waiting to be seated and no one even addressed us. Easy choice to hit the sports bar instead. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I needed a quick, late dinner while staying at the Marriott across the street. This was a good choice - decent menu, and fairly good beer selection. I didn't sample any entrees, but the chicken tenders and salad were fine. Just what you'd expect at a sports bar. The service was friendly, though not all that attentive - even though I was sitting at the bar. I didn't expect a whole lot, so I wasn't disappointed. I'd give it another try on a future visit."}
{"text":"Our book club meets here monthly and Eppie takes such good care of us! He remembers our standing orders, saves our table & just generally makes us feel glad to be there! The food is consistently yummy. The best thing is we can sit and talk and laugh and nobody gives us a disapproving stare."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new sports bar to watch the Pro Bowl so we yelped and found Diamonds. The reviews were so so but we went ahead and went there.  There must have been about 35 people in place. It has very nice decor.  There was one waitress working. She promptly took our order for a dozen wings 6 hot and 6 medium.  She didn't write anything  down When our order came in all 12 were in one basket. The wings tasted the same so we figured she gave us 12 medium wings. Later we ordered a steak sandwich and burger. She didn't write anything down 
When I got my order I got a steak salad. I complained about it and she said she heard steak salad even though my companion also heard steak sandwich 
No Mas Diamond sports grille."}
{"text":"I am from out of State. My in-laws swear the all you can eat fish n chips is to die for. Wasn't impressed. They had little taste and over fried a few times. The coleslaw was ok."}
{"text":"Twice the bartender was petting a dog and never washed her hands. I quickly lost my appetite."}
{"text":"Excellent place to catch a game! We stumbled upon this gem looking for a Vikings Game and have made it our regular Sunday stop. Staff always is great and food is above average for a sports bar. Large portions great price."}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for. Good selection of cheap beers. Haven't tried the food yet."}
{"text":"The rudest server and bartender I have have come across in my life!! Only leaving one star so I can post this. Management needs to step up and get control of these rude girls."}
{"text":"Fine place to check in after a Cubs spring training game."}
{"text":"Very nice and a very sporty feel. We went 4 times this week and I enjoyed 3 of my 4 meals. the first meal was gross due to the awful dressing for my salad. However the fried steak, corn beef and cabbage and hot ham and cheese was amazing and the wait staff was great. The drinks were cold and I would love to go again."}
{"text":"Went in here with my son for a bite to eat after attending an event at the Mesa Centennial Hall. Sat there for 10 minutes and no one served us. Walked out."}
{"text":"Great drinks and good atmosphere.. watch the National championship game there.. Food was ok pretty much bar food..."}
{"text":"Terrible service and the nasty mouth pregnant waitress with belly hanging out and dressed very sloppy, unappealing.  Inappropriate to work with public.  Management needs to re think about staffing needs when there's a concert, or other happenings around area."}
{"text":"Wings are well sauced and crispy (rare these days). The onion rings are pretty good and the potato skins are massive, more like half potatoes. Only downfall is the limited drink selection. 

So many TVs, awesome place to watch multiple college/NFL games. Sit at a table with Eppie as your waiter and I promise you'll be taken care of! He's awesome!!"}
{"text":"This place does what it says!  It's a great local place with pretty fabulous food (for a bar) prices beers and cocktails.

I've been coming here for years. Whenever I stay at the Marriott, it is my go-to lunch place and a fun place to hang out for beers in the evening.  

One of the things I love about this place is the staff. The girls are super friendly and attentive, and it's easy to strike up a conversation! All in all, this is a chill Sports Bar.

So give the Diamonds Sports Grille a try the next time you're in the area. You're sure to have a fun time!"}
{"text":"What a friendly place! I came in on a Saturday evening, with mediocre expectations...it's a sports bar, a dime a dozen. But Diamonds, well that's a different story. First, I was greeted with a genuine smile from very friendly bartender, Antoinette. The spinach artichoke dip was ordered along with a tasty cider. Oh my! Let me tell you about the dip. It was THE BEST I've had in a long time. I travel weekly for work and my go to app is this on any menu...so you might refer to me as SpinachArtichoke dip connoisseur ;)  The homemade dip was full of diced artichokes and chopped spinach and just the right amount of cheese. Icing on the cake was garlic toast served with this appetizer. Lovely! The crowd was a mix of ages and 'types' which in my opinion gave the bar a low key vibe. Diamondbacks were on the big screens. But most people were there to enjoy the company. This is my new hangout :-)"}
{"text":"Overall this place is a plane Jane 3 stars... I had the western burger (see attached photo). I asked for medium, it was very much over that. Fries were a little over seasoned but still OK. Service was god (once she got to me).

Reasons it is not less, a lot of TV's, close to my hotel at the Marriott, good price (food plus a coke and tip was like 15$). I would probably come back if I HAD to, but would try somewhere else first if I had a car in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible service, not enough staff to keep up, not enough glasses to serve beer.  Had to drink out of a plastic cup. new guy trying to service the whole bar while titsmcgee helped only one table.  Only able to get one drink in an hour....then to make matters worse the scraggly a hole behind the bar kept busting out the emergency exit to get more beer.  He got mad because we closed the door after him not knowing he was the help, thought he was just another pissed off patron waiting an hour on a refill.  Never ever going back...stay away."}
{"text":"We just went here for the first time to see the Red Sox play on our anniversary.  They were very friendly, turned the game on and got us a speaker to hear the game when we got there decked out in our Red Sox gear.  The food was fine, the service was good.  Friendly atmosphere.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This place is horrible stayed at the Marriott right next to this place and we were getting ready to come in with a party of 20 and they turned off the music and locked the doors on us at 11:30 p.m. when they CLEARLY saw me and my wife walking up to the front door. The hours of operation clearly state that they're open untill 2 o'clock am on Saturdays. A major inconvenience for all of my friends and family here for a wedding since they ubered there only to have to turn around. Who operates a business like that?

Follow up: went to a nearby dive bar and the patrons there were telling us that this is something they do all of the time. You have a responsibility to the public and when we look it up on Yelp or Google and it says that you're open and people make plans order cabs Ubers Etc you need to have your doors open. Otherwise shut the doors for good and let somebody else operate a business the way it's supposed to be. There is something called truth in advertising and the fact that it is posted on the window at the front door and all over online is something that should hold you accountable. The fact that they would knowingly lock the doors with two people standing outside getting ready to walk in while waiting for the rest of our family and friends to get there is about as ridiculous as it gets. It was pretty apparent in their minds they didn't want to have the business open for just two people but they should have been open for another two and a half hours and they had no idea what was about to come in. Could have been a good night for you guys or at least a whole lot better than it had been. Rude, unprofessional, and should be an emberassment to the owner."}
{"text":"This place has a very nice atmosphere will lots of courteous waitresses. I would definitely suggest this place if you are staying at the Marriott next door, Service was prompt the food was hot and the beer was cold, go to Jesse for good service."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! I sat at the bar at least 8 mins before I actually asked for a menu. Server walked by me 3 times offering drinks to everyone else. I order half of pitcher and I don't get a cup literally till 10 mins later!!! I asked for mild wings and a basket of fries and 15 mins later I finally got but, i got plane wings! I asked for sauce on the side and never got got it!!! Never coming back here at!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! I Love the bartender tonight she was a doll. She was very sweet and attentive. What I admired the most is that she was even polite to the douce bags who gave her a hard time.The food was great and the beers where ice cold, Ill definately be back."}
