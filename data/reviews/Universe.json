{"text":"Got a delivery order in the hopes of finding Montreal style pizza in Calgary. This was not the place for that at all in spite of the owners being from Montreal. The crust was great but the sauce was awful and had a strange taste. The cheese was like pizza hut cheese(yuck I dont even think that's real cheese. Will never order the pizza again. The poutine however was spot on. Best Montreal poutine I've had in Calgary in 14 years of my search."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place was so empty for weekend brunch. The food portions were huge and delicious and we had good service. I will go back!"}
{"text":"I remember when this place opened. It was easy to get a seat. Now its a bit tricky. Their great food and fast friendly service has made them a huge success. They never disappoint. Thank you Universe for giving me a glorious afternoon nap :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend told me a new brunch place opened up near him, so on a Sunday, we were hoping since it just opened it wouldn't  be too busy.  We walked into Universe and were the only ones there. It's odd because it has the most sparse interior. Chairs, tables, light and white walls. We were greeted by a very friendly server and sat down. The menu looks very similar to Cora's, as far as choices and presentation. Needless to say, both my bf and I were pleasantly surprised by this odd little place. I had the \"Ménage a Trois\" which cost $15 and could have fed two. It consisted of 2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast, hash browns, a giant crepe, 4 pieces of bacon and about 2 cups of fruit ( good stuff like strawberries, pineapple, blueberries, kiwi eye. . .) with a side of custard to dip it in. It was all delicious and yes I ate ALL of it by myself.  My bf had the eggs Benedict which came with a generous side of hash browns and fruit as well. Will I be coming back? Heck yah. It probably won't be long before they reduce their portion sizes, so I will be taking advantage of it as long as I can. They also offer a lunch and dinner menu, which I didn't get to look at, but would definitely consider next time. . . If I'm not tempted to order the fat ass breakfast again and again and again. . ."}
{"text":"BEST BRUNCH PLACE EVER with people who genuinely care about their customers!! This is the second time we've been at this restaurant and the experience continues to be exceptional. The food is delicious with very generous portion sizes. And the service is phenomenal. We took our little one there and we've been to many restaurants but this is the first time our server, the owner's daughter, took the time to wipe down the highchair before bringing it over for us. Not only that, she was kind enough to share some of her son's toys for our daughter to play with and brought her some complimentary fruit before we ordered. Their thoughtfulness and attention to their customers really shined through. A great place run by a fantastic family who really cares about the people and their food! We will definitely be going back. :)"}
{"text":"Great little spot! Massive portions, excellent coffee. It would have been great if they had vegan options, but there were plenty of vegetarian menu items. Hubby got the breakfast poutine (whoa. Massive) and I got French toast with fruit. The custard was a little runny, but still good. No waiting line, and our food came fairly quickly. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Tried their Nutella pizza with strawberries and banana. Taste good, but I wish I would have known the dough is fried. I've had it elsewhere were it's baked like a pizza and I'd prefer it that way. Really nice presentation though."}
{"text":"Just ate at Universe and enjoyed it.  It was my first time eating here and it will not be my last.  I asked the owner to prepare his best dish to which he responded by preparing a beautiful tender lamb shank meal. The lamb was so tender that I could eat it easily with just a fork.   The portion for lunch was just perfect.  I am not leaving hungry at all.  The service was very friendly.  The waitress is a very friendly, genuine Mexican.   A pleasureable experience."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for brunch and really enjoyed my experience. The server we had was friendly and efficient. She was attentive whenever our coffee was low and came to refill quickly. The food was good for the price as you are given giant portion sizes! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery from Universe a few times now, and it is definitely a place that will feed you well for a great price! We have yet to be disappointed by the food, having sampled the snails au gratin, pikilia for 2, yogurt, garlic & cucumber dip, red caviar dip (dips are served with warm, soft pita), Caesar salad, Greek salad and their Universe burger. First thing to be aware of is portion size. Their universe burger costs $14, but comes piled with an inch of Montreal style smoked meat on top of the homemade patty and is served with a full sized salad as well as a generous portion of fries. It either feeds two people, or one average person for 2 meals! The owners (who delivered the food) are delightful and from all accounts we look forward to experiencing their brunch at the restaurant. You will want to taste this food, but make sure you bring your appetite!!! They will FEED you."}
{"text":"The owner is a great lady, so sweet and polite and the food is amazing! Dine in or take out is always a great experience!   Everything we eat here is delicious. My boyfriend always enjoy it and absolutely love the poutine so much she recognizes my voice when I order, haha.  We also have had breakfast there and she is on point with this as well.  Plus she actually knows what a poutine is in this city. :) Excellent cheese curds and the gravy is oh so good. Plus you can get it with Montreal smoked meat on top, très bon.   Great care, time, attentiveness and awesome ingredients make this the best poutine in Calgary and the best restaurant to eat on 17th ave! :)"}
{"text":"Saw this place before, walked in.  Empty at the time I went, but I like that.  Had the Simulant 11, ham and eggs.  Eggs are free run and have a great colour and taste!  The side of fruit was awesome, fresh, visually appealing with a nice variety.  I haven't had a banana  in over a year!  $11 + 3 coffee  it is a good deal.  The Misses will like the 4 egg omelettes!!!  I usually don't pay attention, but music selection was nice.  Wait staff and cooks, friendly!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"TAKE OUT REVIEW ONLY!! I don't write reviews until I've tried somewhere thrice.   The first was through Skip The Dishes...HIGHLY Unadvisable as all bread or breaded items will be soggy and drivers don't hold bags appropriately. Decided against this approach ASAP.  Second attempt was calling in order for delivery:  Everything was amazing and fresh!!!  Burger and fries came in cardboard containers(the best for food!!!!)    Third Attempt was pickup on Friday before the rush. Then my burger and fries were soggy as hell and so gross I didn't eat any of it. It was so gross to see and touch that my friends and family are shocked I even tried to eat it. Contained hot food in paper backed tinfoil and styrofoam. Didn't The World disown STYROFOAM I'm the freaking 90's?  I don't know if I'll ever go in this place but I won't be ordering out from here Despite it's all encompassing menu"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their brunch on the weekends. The Montreal smoked meat is pretty darn close to stuff you get in Montreal. The hollandaise is delicious and the portions are really big. I am so glad we tried this place and we will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Reading the yelp reviews I had high hopes.  Finding a family owned restaraunt with great food is one of the best experiences ever.  My hopes began to quickly erode when I first opened the door.  First the atmosphere: The atmosphere is remenecisent of a typical Vietnamese restaraunt that you would find in a strip mall, rectangular with a bar in one corner.  As the front door opens the front of the restaraunt gets cold. Smell, tables and chairs also reminded me of this.  In the corner sat people who I believe to be the owners. They would move from the dining room to the kitchen while wearing winter jackets between cigarettes outside.  We dined on a Wednesday night and there were 6 other people in the restaraunt outside the staff.  Service: The waitress was attentive and I belive she's likely the reason for many of the regulars coming in. Although the waitress seemed eager to please I don't recall her coming around to ask if everything was to our liking (as it was not).  Food: I had the French onion soup and my partner had the calamari to start.  The French onion soup was 4/10. It's not that it was bad per se, but I have had better from a pack from costco.  The calamari was your typical from a frozen bag variety, which was over cooked and quite rubbery.  Might had been the bottom of the bag.   For mains, I had the Spaghetti and meatballs and my partner had a fetuchinni carbonara with a side of their garlic cheese toast (3 massive slices of toasted bread coated in garlic butter and cheese)  The Spaghetti was from a box (which isn't necessarily horrible) and was overcooked to somewhat mushy.  The sauce was a pale comparison to catelli meat sauce from a can. The meat balls were the best part and maybe a 6/10.  For the fetuchinni, the sauce was described as 'greasy' and within 10 minutes had congealed to a solid lump in the bowl.  On the plus, I can say that the portion sizes were humongous but 90% went to waste.  The cheese garlic toast was ok (5/10), however there was something oddly tangy flavored under the cheese.  The garlic toast was probably the highlight of the meal if I had to choose one.  Menu: There was certainly a very wide selection of dishes to choose from, almost too many.  Choices are all over the map from chicken skewers, pizza, submarine sandwiches, montreal smoked meat, seafood, steak and so on.  Lowdown: I will not return. If you are still reading this and do decide to go, I would recommend taking a chance with one of the more authentic Montreal style dishes as  they may do these better.  Our bill total for 2 with no alcohol was just over $70 (including tip).  Happy hunting."}
{"text":"The service was probably the best part, the manager working is absolutely so sweet and kind. The portion sizes are seriously the greatest, almost no matter what you order you'll be full and happy!"}
{"text":"This place completely caught me by surprise.  I was not a fan of the original business that was here prior (some pizza joint), and therefore I didn't think to come poke my head in and sample the food fare.  The more I drove by and walked by, the more curious I became as I was watching the clientele slowly grow, and the presentation of the restaurant to become more inviting.  While the interior is sparse, I think they are just getting settled and I have already detected \"roots being set\" in their new home on busy 17th avenue.   I brought my girlfriend in to try the menu which was pretty appealing to me.  I ordered the MTL Smoked Meat, and OH EM GEE, the serving was a small mountain of meat that literally melted in my mouth.  Sorry hun, no sharing has no become the mantra in my head.    We had appies, the snails with garlic mushrooms, and the spinach feta pie, both were also to die for.  I had to order bread to soak up the delectable sauces.  This place is no joke.    Now for the finale, the dessert.  We had the creme brûlée.  Holy $#!%  The candy top was delicate and flamed to perfection.  The centre was NOT over the top sweet, so you can literally dive in bite after bite (we used our finger to get at the ridges of the dish, waste not want not!).  It was at this point that I was having a fork duel with my gf over the last of it.    And in case I didn't mention, the staff, similar to your aunt and uncle and cousins that you actually like and treat you with real love (which you taste clearly in the food).  Servings : HUGE Taste : Amazing Service : ON THE BALL    I am dieing to go back and try EVERYTHING.  A MUST TRY."}
{"text":"They serve Phil and Sebastion's coffee. The food was great, the staff were friendly. The coffee mug was too small, the coffee would get cold too quick. They have uptown pub/bar style decor, I wish they had more cozy and homey type of decor so people can feel more warmth with their amazing food."}
{"text":"Chose to eat at this spot instead of Cibo or Phil's that are in the same area... it's a smaller restaurant, but don't let that fool you! The servers are really friendly here, prompt on coffee refills, and clearing table which I appreciated. I wanted a basic breakfast so I ordered the classic eggs benny, and he ordered the benny with Montreal smoked meat. I thought the menu prices were a bit much, but when the food hit the table, the portion size was really large and generous. The food came out looking fresh (especially the fruit, this is how I judge a good brunch spot, often the fruit is precut the day before and doesn't look or taste good) the hollandaise was tasty and not too heavy, hash were just how I liked them, crispy! I don't eat bread so the server noticed I left the English muffin on my plate upon clearing and informed me that I can ask for it on tomato instead for next time. I appreciated her suggestion. I would highly recommend this place! A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, the portion are very generous. Very friendly staff and terrific food for breakfast, lunch or dinner. One of the best kept secrets of Calgary."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and huge portions of farm fresh food satisfying every palette from all day breakfasts, pizzas, pasta and sandwiches. Oh yeah, they'll deliver breakfast, too."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a few times now and each time the food was good. Poutine's are done well, burgers were also good. Their cheesecake is amazing! Will definitely continue to order from them."}
{"text":"The food was okay, when I went staff was missing one person and made a order was a problem. I ate undecided breakfast, and eggs were in different temperature of meat."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in town !! Good ambiance Delicious breakfast  Very good food  Lots of varieties"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure Universe is called universe because they have everything on their menu. Eat ALL the things!!!  They're a classy looking, modern-styled rather minimalist loungey looking spot with a really nice lady working there serving diner breakfast, steaks, shrimp, chicken, pasta dishes, pizza, Montreal smoked meat, poutine... the menu goes on and on but it's all really standard. I hate to say it, but it reminded of a less inspired Denny's menu. Had I been cruising along the Trans-Canada and come across Universe as the one place to eat in a hundred kilometres, the menu would have made sense to me and I would have welcomed it with arms wide open. But in such a densely packed area along 17th Ave, I was left uncertain what would make me choose Universe over any of the other places along the strip.   I got the Menage a Trois breakfast to go and was happy I had someone to share it with because it was definitely enough for two people. It was big, but yet again, I thought it was entirely standard. Eggs, hashbrowns, some run of the mill ham slices, breakfast sausages, bacon and some mixed fruit. It was exactly what I would expect and would have enjoyed at a highway-side diner.  But in a busy, downtown area I just feel like if you want breakfast, there are better breakfast spots, if you want smoked meat, there are better smoked meat spots, if you want steak... it just goes on and on.  You're AOK, Universe, but I had trouble understanding just what it is that you want to do."}
{"text":"Couldn't love Universe more. The service is excellent and the food is even better. The menu is very impressive with lots of selection for breakfast/brunch, lunch and dinner. We've eaten here regularly since they opened and have never been disappointed--as delicious and generous as the portions appear in the menu, they are even more beautiful and huge in person.   My favorite order is the breakfast Ménage a trois--two eggs, sausage or bacon, and a french crepe with custard, served with potatoes, fruit and toast. I usual say no to the toast because it's such a large portion. And always impeccable! And the eggs--so beautiful; golden orange and rich in flavor.  Can't stop gushing about Universe. I've taken everyone to this place, including parents and inlaws and the consensus is, more-or-less, \"Like Cora but better!\"  I've never been to Cora but I don't need to to know Universe is amazing.   Their pizza is tasty, but this isn't primarily a pizza joint so if you're looking for something on the level of most pizzerias in town, Universe's pizza is yummy, but will be a bit disappointing. The burgers, though, are fantastic! Huge and homemade with so much for sides I always take half the meal home. For &12. I love this place and will continue to frequent it often."}
{"text":"I hate to say it... it's a bust. Was trying to get into Galaxie but the wait was too long and had a bit of a timeline to keep. Menu had pictures, in all my past experiences this is a red flag. Portion sizes were large, I didn't finish my plate and I didn't feel good afterwards. Service was slow but friendly, seems family run. Strange feel to it also, tries to come off upscale and had sports 50 worst and best plays of the year on the TV. I just didn't have a great experience but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try it for yourself it could have been an off day. I'm not from Calgary but I do pass through a few times a year. Better breakfast spots to hit up IMO."}
{"text":"I have been there numerous times and I order different things and the food always taste amazing! It is a must go to whenever down in Calgary"}
{"text":"OH MY WORD this place is amazing!  The portion sizes are huge and the food is delicious.  Calgary people if you have not been here you are most definitely missing out.  The staff are friendly and so delightful.  You will get the whole package here with customer service, food, portion and price.  One will feel it is worth the experience.  This is a MUST try...do not wait as this is a gem of a place."}
{"text":"I had an amazing first experience here. The staff was friendly and the food was absolutely delicious. The portions were huge and we had a great time. Nothing like mimosa and eggs Benny to start the week! AAA will come again"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Had my first experience here on the weekend for a friends birthday brunch. Loved that I could make a reservation a day before and get in for a table of 6. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the food, large portions and beautiful plates filled with deliciousness. Our service was 5 stars and the kicker was they found out it was my friends birthday, brought her a lovely cheesecake and played Happy Birthday over their speaker system. Hands down best place I've been to in a long time. Have already recommended and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"this is breakfast poutine, included sausage, bacon, cheese curd... lots of the hollandaise sauce; size portion is huge and just only $13, one person cant finish, i took the half dish to back home."}
{"text":"I'm sorry , I have a problem with this place! I always dive into the food before taking a picture!  Good food , big portions, and great value for money. I have been there 3 times so far, the Montreal Smoked meat sandwich was lovely, the French toast is very very nice, I've had different versions of the egg , and I have always enjoyed it. The service is great , welcoming , and accommodating if you need to change things in your order . This place is a gem , I will be back again , and again."}
{"text":"Universe staff is extremely friendly and personable. The food is typical Montreal food with smoke meat in a whole lot of things. Their menu is quite vast. It's more of a comfort food kind of place and a relaxed place with a lot of French Canadians which I think reminds a lot of their home. As a guy that spent 10 months in Montreal I quite enjoyed it.  If you're an organic all salad type this may not be the place for you lol."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food!!!  Sometimes you just have to ask the universe ... and it delivers!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from this restaurant though \"skip the dishes\"! Fantastic food and arrived hot. Definitely will be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"My friends and I go here weekly, the staff is great, food never disappoints. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Being new to the area, I decided to continue my quest for another great breakfast place. The decor/ambience here is nothing fancy at all, however the service and portions are great. Reasonably priced and a breakfast that does not dissapoint to get you through the day."}
{"text":"To be honest this review should be a zero star because I wasn't even able to taste the food. The service was horrible. I'm generally a very patient person especially when it's busy at a restaurant. However, when my girlfriend and I had waited for over 70 minutes after ordering (about 10 minutes to order) to learn that our food was given to another table and that our orders weren't re-entered and would have to be out in again we walked out.   Put table numbers on your tables if you guys can't keep orders straight. It's a bit unprofessional to have waitresses wondering around asking who ordered the Undecided."}
{"text":"Love love love this place ! Montreal owners brought all the classic Montreal dishes to one restaurant! If your from MTL you'll reminisce once you see all your favourites on one menu just had the breakfast and although there are a lot of options on 17th  for breakfast this is a nice change from the pretentious restaurants around. Think homey style restaurant. you really get a bang for your buck at this place a lot of good quality food at a decent price! Can't wait to try the dinner here I'll make sure to bring an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Service was great, very friendly environment. The waitresses were very sweet and kind. The portions are huge for a decent price. The hash browns were too salty but other than that, it was great. I would eat here again"}
