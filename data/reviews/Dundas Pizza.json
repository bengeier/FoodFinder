{"text":"I moved to the Junction a month ago, and this is my \"go to\" place for pizza.  For $3, you get an enormous slice, cut in half.  Slices are loaded with pepperoni and a thick layer of cheese.  The crust is delicious.  I'll often come right at 11:00am to get the freshest slice possible as that's when it's freshly made.  I've gone for a slice at least once a week since January... this is a delicious problem! =)"}
{"text":"A winnah!  After reading the positive reviews on Chowhound, I had to try this place out.  I was looking for a Montreal-style pizza in Toronto.  A tall order in a town where some eateries still have the guts to use mozzarella cheese on top of gravy 'n fries and call it a poutine.  *shudder*

Anyhow, back to the pizza.  Walked in, ordered two X-large pizzas for $30, one a classic \"all dressed\" (pepperoni, shrooms, and green peppers) and a vegetarian (tomatoes, shrooms, green peppers, olives and onions.)  I made sure to ask the guy to put the cheese on top of the toppings a la Montrealaise.  Cheese was loaded on and the result was golden cheesy goodness that covered the toppings completely.

The result was a juicy pizza that was a close to my favourite pizzeria (Gigi's of Pte Claire west island of Montreal) and heads and tails above any pizza I've had in Toronto.  This place is strictly a take out place and there's no seating."}
{"text":"Great little independent shop. It's a high school hang out during the day. Doesn't have long hours, so it is not good for a satiating late-night snack: it would be long closed by that point. Good but not great pizza. However, if you want just a slice, it's basically the place to go to in the West Junction area along Dundas Street.

The atmosphere can be described as \"a dive\", with one table for eating, making  this strictly a take out food place. Good service, and good prices for the size of pizza you get. 

A better tasting pizza slice can be had at King Slice on Bloor Street, but that's almost 3 km away. So for the price and convenience, Dundas Pizza is your only option in the area.

It does accept debit, but charges a fee if the order is below $20. Most slices are under $4. It also serves chicken wings and kebobs as well."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings.  Buy weight alone, the best deal in TO.  Spring rolls are better than most Thai take out places"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for Dundas Pizza, I'd be a really hungry and broke guy. I honestly don't know how the owner makes any money with the amount of toppings he puts on a slice. For $2.75 you get a pepperoni slice with a nice, fat, greasy crust and a generous thick gooey layer of cheese. For $3.50 you can have a slice of heaven AKA the Hawaiian slice. Averages four entire strips of bacon, an even thicker layer of cheese (must be close to a centimeter!), that thick doughy greasy crust, a layer of salamis underneath (double stacked) and a generous amount of pineapple. Or the Deluxe which has the same salami layer (It even overlaps and coats the entire bottom), before ascending to a fruit basket full of fresh veg (tomatoes and green peppers still juicy by the time it's served) and a thick thick layer of cheese. All slices are a quarter of a large pizza, if you want to order a pizza just ask for four slices. YOU WILL BARELY BE ABLE TO FINISH A HAWAIIAN SLICE! On the real, I've been able to comfortably feed me and my girlfriend with these slices. He doesn't skimp on anything! And all the pizza is fresh baked and has that excellent homemade taste. There's three or four other pizza places within a 5 minute walk, but none of them can hold a candle to Dundas. Admittedly, it is a style thing... I love greasy, thick crust, deep dish pizza and if you prefer wafer-thin crispy ristorante-style pizza, you will HATE Dundas Pizza. It's the polar opposite from Vesuvios' thin \"gourmet\" pizza. However, if you're all for thick, filling, heavy, luxuriously bohemian slabs of pork swimming in thick gooey cheese, this is your diamond in the rough. The chicken wings are some of the fattest I've ever encountered but usually not that fresh. The garlic breadsticks are incredibly fresh and delicious, fully worth the $1.25 he's asking for them. Definitely my favorite pizza joint in Toronto."}
{"text":"Do not try this location. I sent a complaint three months ago to the head office regarding my order which was placed two hours before my arrival to found that the order is not ready yet besides i have to drive 20 minutes  to that location specifically for Halal pepperoni. No action taken
Today is the second time in 6 weeks to get almost burned pizza. First time we complained while dinning in and we had to wait another 20 minutes to get one we can eat. 
Today we had the same situation, burned and hard dough.
For sure the level of the store became so poor.
Not only the pizza but also the cleanliness of the workers.

{"text":"I am a fan of Chicago style (aka \"deep dish\") pizza.  Sadly in the west part of Toronto there are very limited if any options of this style of pizza.

A quick search for \"deep dish pizza\" in Toronto landed me on the reviews for this place. I should have called in advance to confirm this yet I didn't and  decided to give it a try as I was in the neighbourhood. They do not offer deep dish style pizza.

To keep it short and sweet the pros:
This is a place that indeed will provide you with great value for your money. The portions (if you buy slices) are very generous.
Toppings are abundant no matter if you are a walk-in customer or a call ahead one.
Cheese as stated by Steve C. is always lavishly spread \"on top\" unless you specifically ask otherwise.
Does it beat ANY of the \"plastic\" chains/franchises in town? Hands down.  Will this be the best tasting pizza you will have in your life? Most certainly not.  Overall taste and quality I give an 8 in a scale of 10.

The few cons:
If you are looking for deep dish pizza/Chicago style, you will be disappointed!
They do not offer delivery, only pick up.
Parking on Dundas is limited. If you think you scored a rock star spot at the door, be careful: It is always available because it is a fire hydrant area and police hides on the little side street @ Starbucks and waits for you to walk in to pick up your pizza bounty to ticket you.
They only accepted forms of payment are cash or debit/interact."}
{"text":"Best spring rolls I ever had, pizza is very generous with toppings , prices very cheap ."}
{"text":"The pizza was like frozen boxed pizza and the chicken was old.  I wanted to like this place because it is close to home and seemed like a good deal.  It is a no deal kind of place.  I do not recommend."}
{"text":"This small take out pizza joint in the Junction area turns out some okay pie.  

You can call in ahead of time to place an order for pick up, but we just drop in and take a large pizza of whatever's available - pepperoni, deluxe, Hawaiian or a combo of slices to make up a large.

Large pizzas priced under $15 and takes a few minutes to be ready.  It beats waiting around for the Pizza Pizza guy to show up at the door with a lukewarm pizza."}
