{"text":"Looking for a spot to have brunch in Marda Loop, but the Belmont was packed. Was surprised to find F and B serving brunch. We were greeted and seated immediately upon entering. Nice window seats.   Ordered coffees - odd to not order a cocktail,  however the cocktail menu have a nice variety of brunchy drinks. Ordered a cinnamon swirl french toast and my babe ordered eggs benny. Meals came out promptly and were excellent. Didn't get to taste the eggs benny as they were ferociously inhaled by my evidently starving angel. Cinnamon f.t. was very nice and the thick cut bacon was delicious. Great spot to bring family as well."}
{"text":"While the atmosphere is typical of a sports bar, the food is much better than you'd expect. I also appreciate how well this restaurant livens up the street space, and has some great patio tables.   We come here often, and have always enjoyed our entrees. The veggie burger in particular is delicious. The yam fries were a little undercooked last time though."}
{"text":"Average upscale bar/pub. Not good for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"I went there after work with a friend for a few drinks... We sat down at a table, and waited for someone to stop by and drop off a menu or take our drink orders. We waited.... And waited... Tried to make eye contact with a waitress... I considered the hand movements to wave down a 747, but then... Finally, after 17 minutes, yes 17 MINUTES a perky waitress came over and asked what we wanted to order...when I told her we didn't even have a menu yet, she went and got them for us.. But that took another 3-4 minutes... Finally, she brought them over and said she would be back in a few minutes... I asked her to wait (fearing the next time I saw her I would be dead of thurst), and she took the menu out of my hands, and pointed to what they had for beers. Of course, I thanked her, we each ordered a drink and left for another pub where we would get a drink and service worthy of the expensive menu. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Alright. So when you sit down and the table next to you is clearly inebriated once you hear them making fun of you for all being on your phones (as momentarily we were all checking into Yelp, loti) as if you can't hear them, but then ironically they all get on their phones - inside you end up fuming.  Knowing that, like in the movie \"Frozen\" I should just let it go, admittedly so, it was hard for me to do that UNTIL my first bite of what turned out to be a very palatable fish 'n chips order happened.  When I moved back to Calgary two years ago, I always seemed to be disappointed when I ordered Fish' n Chips at various establishments. But here - I was not! Always a good idea to ask the staff themselves how they feel about a particular dish you are thinking of ordering, our server (who had a very positive way about her) spoke highly of it and you could see the excitement in her eyes as she described it's beer batter. So I was sold.  Served with coleslaw and fries - the coleslaw I didn't care for as for some reason it had fennel in it and that overpowered the simple ingredients which I could tell made it a good coleslaw minus the fennel. But, maybe others will like it for those of you that favour the black licorice taste. The fries though... golden deliciousness! Super crispy on the outside and cooked just right on the inside. I wanted to eat more, but refrained as I knew I could not finish the second piece of fish (two per serving) and knew I had better save some fries to go with it again the next day.  So speaking of the next day... Here comes the test. Will it be just as good as it was fresh, the night before??? Low and behold, it was! Oh yummy!  Someone else's review said that the food is better than you'd expect for a pub. I concurr. Plus, though the staff must be exhausted if you're choosing to dine here when it is late at night, they don't show it. Not even a little bit.  A late night hunger lead us to this place and glad they were still open because now I know I will be back."}
{"text":"I wasn't able to try out any of the beers during my first visit to Fergus & Bix, but I sure loaded up on the food. They offer a pretty decent modern American menu with all the standard kinds of dishes you would find at your local Joey's or Milestones. The great thing about places like these is that there's usually something on the menu for everyone. However, the menu wasn't new and exciting. Luckily, I knew what I was craving, and they had it on the menu: steak and mashed potatoes.  The steak came with a side of carrots and green beans (boring) as well as a delicious side of mashed potatoes - I wish they gave me more. My friend ordered a bunch of wontons and an ahi tuna appetizer. She seemed to love them, and I was thoroughly satisfied with my steak and sides.  I think what really made the night were two things: the chocolate cake with the most amazing white chocolate raspberry ice cream, and the elevator. Yes. Fergus & Bix has an elevator. It takes you upstairs to the washroom, and down to the parkade. if you're looking for a nicer place to hang out and have a beer, this is a great place to do it.  Just a tip: I ended up parking on the street because I totally missed the parkade entrance. I was looking for an unsightly concrete structure, but the parking is actually underground."}
{"text":"Fergus and Bix was terrible.   It is extremely over-priced in terms of food (chopped flat iron steak with potato and asparagus for 24$)- and not as good as the chains it aspires to be like (The Keg, Kelsey's, Moxie's).  My friend ordered a pizza (they were priced at 18$) and asked for a substitution and said it would be extra to downgrade from Italian sausage to plain pepperoni because all the pizzas are pre-made. What does that mean? They are frozen? They are all pre-made at the start of the day? It's not delivery, it's delissio? The pizza tasted like it.   Beer selection was expansive enough and not horribly priced, so that was a positive. But I would say: although the food is palatable...the prices it are not. You feel cheated."}
{"text":"This is a nice spot. Great selection of beers. Servers know their stuff and are good at making recommendations as to what to try, beer wise. They are attentive without being over bearing which is awesome.  Good ambience - gets a little loud but not so much you can't talk/hear. Nice mix of tables and booths.  The only weird thing is the location of the washrooms - up a couple of flights of stairs.   I'd come back here for sure - it's a great neighborhood spot. Parking is a bit of a pain but there is a fair bit of street parking nearby."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Marda Loop area.........pub food.....but really good pub food......"}
{"text":"Decent trendy pub-like/sports bar spot in Marda Loop with comfy seats and low lights.  Clean, well-staffed and televisioned, Fergus & Bix has the kind of little-bit-of-everything menu you'd expect from a Canadian sports-type bar that includes some pizzas, some sandwiches, some burgers, some wings and dips with a few wildcards like Asian lettuce wraps and blackened chicken thrown in for good measure.   Although the menu seems 'boring' the flavours are nice and the ingredients fresh.  Beers on tap are, again, what you'd expect with a couple hard-to-find brews.  A jewel in the cap of Fergus & Bix would be their wine and appy Wednesday, where a glass of rouge and a snack is $10, also, the Marda Loop location has dedicated unground parking, which is much needed in this busy community.   Overall, Fergus & Bix is decent; it's everything you'd expect from a chain-type pubish place with well done middle-of-the-road food and drink.   T."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend stopped in here while we were checking out Marda gras on Sunday.   The Patio was huge and it was a warm day so we wanted to chill outside.   As was expected the patio was full, but we managed to find a table right inside but all the doors were open so it was like being on the patio without being in the Sun. I ordered the father's office burger and she ordered a salad of some kind. We all know that salad don't deserve a mansion in a yelp review. We ordered our food about 15 minutes after getting to the restaurant, however it took almost 45 minutes to come out. I guess this is to be expected during a street event like this. When I looked at the burger and fries, I was immediately saddened. I ordered a double order of fries but there weren't that many on the plate.  they also appeared to be store bought frozen fries. Maybe I'm wrong, but there was absolutely nothing special about them. Now let's get to the burger because I know that's what you've all been waiting for. All I can say about the burger is that it was amazing. I judge a pub by how well they make a burger and even though the fries were a big let down, the burger was delicious. I don't really have any fancy words to describe what it tastes like as I ate it other than it tasted like a delicious burger followed by a few disappointing fries, followed by an amazing bite of burger. All in all this place was pretty tasty and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The second star is for the competent service and the reasonable beer selection. But my food was terrible. I had the \"Dad's office burger\" or something similarly-named. It was greatly overcooked and SALTY. Not in the reasonable range -- I love salty things -- but way too salty. Salty enough to mess-up my physiology for over a day!  I had an A&W burger two days later and looked at the nutritional information to estimate the sodium content for comparison. I estimate my burger at the Fergus & Bix had around 4000 mg of sodium. As in, would you like some meat with your salt. Atrocious."}
{"text":"Not sure if my review is really worth it, as I had one drink and left. I've been to this place many times through it's ever changing faces.   This time in particular I was here for a friends surprise party, so we had the entire upstairs rented out, which was nice. Had our on server and so forth.   Nice little patio area on the balcony and there is an elevator to get upstairs. Although I'm sure stairs would be faster. Not much to say I had a mojito, which was good, bu no food. Not really in my neck of the woods, but I would for sure check it out again."}
{"text":"Great friendly service ... beet salad is too die for. Easy underground parking."}
{"text":"Our family (with extended family and friends) was attending a post-wedding party in  the private function room upstairs.   Parking was a bit of a challenge today since the underground parking was closed due to an electrical problem.  Although the brunch menu listed at least 4 types of eggs Benedict, yogurt sundae, breakfast pizza, B.E.L. CH (bacon, eggs, lettuce, cheese,  panini), I thought that the menu was quite limited.  I would have liked to have seen some appetizers (e.g. wings, calamari) or side dishes (sweet potato fries, salads, soups).  There were also no desserts listed on the menu (maybe there was a separate menu, but we didn't ask).   Our two servers were pleasant, attentive and efficient.   In the midst of about thirty   noisy guests, they came frequently to check on our tables.  My teapot was always full of hot water! My eggs Benedict with smoked salmon was cooked perfectly; the kitchen was very generous with the portions of smoked salmon!  My hash browns were nice and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside and my fruit cup (slices of orange, strawberries, pineapple, blackberry and raspberries) was as fresh as you can get it (in December).  Overall, we had a very pleasant experience.  I would like to come back and try the fish and chips!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot in Marda Loop.  The Fergus & Bix burger is out of this world. The atmosphere is lively but upscale. Owner was the originator of Original Joes. Good food, good service, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is probably our favourite neighborhood pub. A good menu but I can't speak to everything as I tend to stick to my favourites. Decent beer selection but they could shake it up once in a while. The staff is usually pretty good but it seems like they have quite a bit of turnover and it can be really random. The last time we went it felt like the host was on his first day on the job and in way over his head. Expect to wait for a table if you show up at any time that's even remotely popular and don't have a reservation."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great drinks, I haven't had a single thing here that wasn't good. The ambiance is great and an awesome place for a first date or 18th birthday dinner"}
{"text":"Service was great and very attentive!  I shared the nachos with my friend with pulled pork and extra sour cream. We saw the extra cheese option and didn't think we would need it because usually a normal amount of cheese is good for us, but when we got our plate we realized why that was there. There was a minimal amount of cheese on them, and it seems like they jump at any opportunity to charge you for things that should be already priced in your dish. Like guacamole! It was $4 to add it to the nachos!  Our other two friends enjoyed their plates and we ended up sharing dessert. Not anything amazing... The key lime pie was too green, very fake looking which threw us off a lot. The chocolate cake tasted ok as well. Overall the food was decent due to our choice in dishes. I feel like there are a bunch of tasty hamburgers and other options on the menu that have a lot more to offer than cheese-less nachos. But again, the service and atmosphere were amazing!"}
{"text":"Have been here few times on different occasions and with different group of people; food is good, cannot rate it as outstanding though; huge portions that you can share; even the brunch items are huge and it can easily serve 2 people; they have great selection of beer too; they only allow minors on weekends for brunch, other than that you cannot take your children there. Service has been OK, nothing outstanding but at least it has always been the same, which is good. Ambience is good; if you go during summer or on some sunny warm days they have their Patio open. Great location, a little bit busy parking lot but overall good experience at all times."}
{"text":"We didn't have very good service from our waitress when we dropped by mid afternoon for lunch during the Marda Gras Festival. That, tables who arrived & ordered after us receiving their food before us, and the restaurant couldn't seem to get our kids order of buttered noodles right....well it really didn't leave a good first impression.  What did however was the food. Hubs had the fish & chips and it was seriously delicious. A contender in the fish & chips market I'd say. I had the Asian Lettuce Wraps which were also very good.  Nice selection of beverages. We enjoyed trying a Three Flight Sampler and in turn some new beers.  I get restaurants are super busy during Festivals but that's no excuse to not provide top quality service especially since you want to impress and entice new paying customers to come back.  The food alone would bring us back for a second try. Without kids."}
{"text":"Great customer service goes a long way. When the manager (Ali) remembers you, and when the server goes out of her way to make sure you have a good time, you go from 4-stars, to 5-stars! Congratulations Bix & Fergus!"}
{"text":"I was only here for a quick drink late on a Friday night, but I was impressed!!  Its about time this area opened a fresh, new space, and Fergus & Bix does not disappoint. Love the underground parking. LOVE the patio. Interior is classy, comfortable, and modern. Loved the upstairs area where you can host private events! My drink was delicious and the server was quick, attentive, and friendly. My one complaint would be that the bathrooms are rather drab, definitely not matching up to the decor of the restaurant. But that's minor, as they were clean and well stocked.  I'm really looking forward to returning here for more drinks and food!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night during the first snowfall of the season, so this could totally have had an effect on the experience.   I heard about this place through a classmate. My friend came in from Vancouver and we wanted to have a really nice meal. I appreciated the underground parking because my car still had snow on it and paid $3 for 3 hours (on a Sunday). When we first came in we were greeted by the bartender and were not sure if we waited to be seated or seated ourselves, some clarification would have been nice, but he said sit wherever. The space is really nice looking. My friend and I ordered lots of water, a beer each and split an appetizer and a pasta dish and finished with a dessert. All of them were super delicious! Our waitress came around often enough that it wasn't annoying but enough so we never had to ask for refills on our water. My friend was impressed and so was I. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Cool place! It's almost gastro pub?? Maybe?? Well that's how I felt anyway! I was happy to come here to visit an old friend and listen to his med school war stories and whimsical tales of adventure ! This was really the perfect setting to do that with our group  I didn't eat anything here, just got a couple of pints of my favorite drink, wild rose velvet fog. I was very pleased to see it on the menu along with a rather great selection of other local beer.  I would certainly like to come back here at some point and try the food. It seemed a lot more gourmet than average which could be good or bad ... Next time, I'll l give the menu a good test and let yelp know. One other thing I liked about this place was the crowd. No rowdy patrons here, mostly nicely dressed and mature adults who just want cool space to hang out at. The service was great here nothing bad to say! Come try it out! It's a fun little hangout point!"}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant many times before,  where the service and food was fabulous.  This evening was an exception.  The food was good,  but so disappointed in how our waitress and shift manager dealt with inadequacy on their part. I ordered the malbec and decided I wanted another,  well I was advised that they ran out.  I wanted to know what they had I lieu of that wine. My waitress advised me they had no other malbec by the glass,  but I could order a bottle. I was with a group of friends that were all either drinking white wine or beer. I told her I wanted a glass and she said they didn't have anything but the bottle.  At this point I was getting annoyed as they didn't offer any resolution.  I wanted malbec by the glass which was on the menu.  So she brought a couple samples I chose another wine. Well I got my bill and at this point they decided to charge me for 3 glasses.  I spoke with the \"manager on duty\" he proceeding to tell me not to yell at his waitress and that he wasn't going to charge me the price of the wine I wanted for my second glass but the price that was on the menu. So for one a restaurant doesn't have something they should offer you something of comparable quality for the same price. Two you don't tell your customers off and insult them with false accusations.  Yes I'm livid and super disappointed in the service and attitude of the staff here. Going forward I will be having my events elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food is better than \"average\" pub fare however, it's not the best/creative at all. I like it for watching games and having a brew or two, and it's close to my house.   Good TV, good Bar area, clean place. Line ups can get annoying.   Oh, the bathroom is on the 3rd floor - try not to get too hammo'd there."}
{"text":"Headlined as a Restaurant and Beer Market, F&B does not disappoint on either front. Walking in, you get the feeling it might be something akin to an Earl's with its decor, lighting and music choices, but at its heart this restaurant is content to serve up solid grub and offer dozens of Canadian beer choices. Alley Kat, Wild Rose, Canmore - plenty of local breweries contribute to the impressive beer list, and the price for a pint is reasonable compared to other restaurants that would charge much higher for local flavor.  My Fergus & Bix burger was a monster, a hand-packed half-pound slab of ground goodness on a sesame bun with the usual burger fixings; I added cheddar for some flavor that really cut. You get a wide selection of sides: fries, Yukon gold potatoes, three different veggie options including ceasar salad, and - seemingly just for fun - edamame. As a frequent consumer of said beans, I had to give them a try, and they were quite well done: shelled, with a generous sprinkling of sea salt. My friends got the smoked applewood sliders to start and liked them so much they ordered it twice more. I had a morsel and was sold: smoked applewood cheddar and bell pepper relish on a tiny burger is close to heaven.  This recently opened Marda Loop location is in a prime spot with a private parking lot and street space; it was not overly busy for a Friday night during a Flames game. It was a good atmosphere, plenty of opportunities to catch up and chat for a few hours while coming down with a severe case of Ninentdo Butt. Our waitress was also quite pleasant, and joyfully tolerant of Kenny M's compulsive shredding of paper coasters. This seems to be a winning choice in Marda Loop for late-night eats and hanging out."}
{"text":"Great food, with healthy options,  and great service. The atmosphere is awesome, especially on the patio :)"}
