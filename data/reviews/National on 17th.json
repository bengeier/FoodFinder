{"text":"Don't make a reservation. Don't even fucking dress up. And for fuck sakes, do not wait in their line. Roll in this bitch like you are Johnny Depp (you know, greasy hair, sunglasses inside, sans deodorant) and head straight to the bar, it is fucking huge. 

Park your gigantic ass at the bar and order pickled eggs, scotch eggs or their in-house gorgeously made pickles. The menu is a smorgasbord of yummy food and their beer selection is an alcoholics wet dream. You'll rack up quite a bill (but you are rolling like Depp, remember?) but then again, just sucker a date into paying so who gives a crap.

Five fucking stars for doing to eggs what KISS did to the women of the 70's, or something. Keep up the good work. *John-hug"}
{"text":"loud but good music; amazing tap list for beer. not the most sophisticated place, but if you're thirsting for a beer other than the industrial options, and you're willing to brave the youth there to binge, then it's worth it."}
{"text":"Ah National - I still remember how excited we were to find out a craft beer bar was opening just a block & a half away. Then I remember the acute disappointment we felt when we discovered that knowledgeable beer fans were not National's target market. Who is National on 17th's target customer? Well, let's just say that the real reason Melrose Cafe had to close was that, surprisingly, there is not an infinite supply of douche bags on the Red Mile, & Melrose couldn't survive on National's leftovers. 

But anyway, let's just skip over the early days of finding NO vegetarian meals on the menu (and finding nothing that wasn't a saturated fat bomb), the times we ran dry for ages without service, the times the staff knew nothing about the beers on tap, & even the time we thought would give them one more try & ended up with poutine without curds (& then when they finally brought me proper poutine when my partner was almost finished his meal, they ended up charging me twice!)

Yes, I've decided to forget all that because almost a year after what we thought would be our final visit, my partner & I started chatting with a guy at the Ship one night who commiserated with us on our bad National experiences, then said he was their new manager. 

Jason & I really love craft beer, & apparently you have to be absolutely appalling for us to never return. We decided to give National one more try. 

Good news! It has improved, somewhat. I haven't had a serious service issue in 2014, although we did run dry a few times (but nothing severe). 

Food has improved for vegetarians. The mac & cheese is very yummy, and is so large I had to take half home with me. The menu does vary, though, so you never know how many vegetarian offerings will be available.  

Last visit I had something called the \"GLORY BOWL\" described as \"tofu, pea shoots, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, tahini dressing, brown rice\". I asked the server if there were other vegetables in there (as that sounded a bit lean) & she assured me there were others, & mentioned carrots. So I ordered. But what she didn't mention was beets. I detest beets, as I am not fond of the taste of dirt. (I know the proper foody phrase is \"earthy\" but c'mon, dirt is dirt) 

If you are going to add beets to a dish, you need to mention it! Diners need to know that if they want to stir their food to blend the flavours, one dirt-tasting ingredient is going to bleed all over the rest of the meal in the colour of bad '80s lipstick. You can't just surprise them with that! Still, the tahini sauce was not bad - you might like this if you like beets. 

The beer is still excellent. The on screen menu done as a train station schedule is interesting but hard to read & often not accurate; I usually just stick to the paper menus. Those screens change to tvs during live sporting events. Currently they only serve North American craft brews - limits them somewhat, but on the other hand you don't catch them padding their numbers with crappy beers from anywhere (looking at you, Craft Beer Market). National on 17th wins my award for best lengthy tap list in the city at the moment. 

Accessibility - yes, although the main seating is long picnic tables which I honestly find difficult to navigate with a cane. There are also tables with free standing chairs which would definitely work best for wheelchairs. Bathrooms are out the hall on the main floor & I believe they are wheelchair accessible (will check & update next time I visit)

Good patio around the corner of 17th Ave & 5th St SW. They also have heaters for cooler nights. Shaw Open is available for Shaw customers; otherwise there is no wifi. 

I am putting this on my Vegetarian Friendly in the Beltline List for now but I may have to remove it depending on how the menu changes in the future. I may also have to update this review to more stars if my 2014 experience continues, but at the moment I am still wary after being burned so many times."}
{"text":"It was all good till my main meal came out and then it made a re-appearance later that night.

I'm all for food but when food makes me sick I'm not a happy lady. I'm still giving it a 3 because I did have fun up until I bit into my still beating burger. It tasted raw it smelled raw and it was barely warm. Oh and it was turkey not typically something you get food poisoning from but hey cross contamination mixed with lack of being cooked through I'm going with the burger.

We did get wings, jalapeno poppers and deep fried pickles but as everyone in my group shared and I was the only person who got sick. (lucky me!) So, my vote is on the burger. Anyway enough about the stupid burger. Beer selection was meh. I was really hoping for some different beers on the menu but it came pretty standard and then it was missing some beer essential players. So okay I'm picky... but really I couldn't get Guinness (BOO ON YOU)

Deep fried pickles were amazing! Actually the starters were all really good.
That's all I can remember. I had fun, then I didn't, then I went home, then I was sick. Cool."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this establishment out and left very disappointed. It was very busy with all indoor seating full. The patio was open so we sat there and waited and waited and waited and waited. No greeting, no server, no busser to clear the dirty table. As I looked to see if I was missing something, a couple girls sat at the next table informed us we had to order at the bar. There was no service on the patio. So my friend and I went to the bar leaving our ladies to hold the table. After waiting a good 15 min to order a drink and not even being acknowledged by the bar staff, we said screw it and left.

Easily wasted 45 min here and got nothing out of it. Went next door to the Ship and got a table, got beers and lunch all inside an hour.

I guess I will likely give National a try again but WOW what a let down! !"}
{"text":"So, the first thing I thought to myself when seeing there was a beer hall opening up next to the Ship was, 'that's stupid', they can;t compete with the Ship. Then I realized that's not the case at all. It's a great idea. They'll get the overflow from the Ship, especially with a patio on a busy spot of the 17th Ave. strip. After I went and visited, I decided that I'd go to national regardless, because thus far, it can hold it's own.

I can't help but compare it to it's old incarnation, the Mercury, which was too dark. National opened up the place by putting windown from ceiling to floor, which let's in a lot of light. It has communal picnic table seating, which encourages strangers to talk to each other, which is another thing I enjoy, and cool chandeliers hanging from above.

The server was prompt to take our drink and food orders, and was extremely friendly. 
I had the Pulled Chicken sandwich ($14) with srichacha mayo and pickles. Amazing! The only thing I didn't like was that there's no side, and it costs $3-5 for a tiny portion of salad that took 4 bites to eat. I need more greens. My sister had the quarter chicken dinner that came with potatoes and a small salad ($14), and again, amazing. 
My friend and his gf shared the prezel bread ($*) that came with a mustard dipping sauce and a creamy chesse (we think) type dip, both quite good. However, thw absolute best dish was the Lobster Poutine ($16)that they let me try. This was the best poutine I have ever had. I'm definitely oredering next time. We all finished off with the deep fried Mars bar and vanilla gelato ($8). It's served cut into small pieces and with a custard dip to use for both the Mars bar and the ice cream. One serving was sweet and satisfying enough for the four of us.

All in all this was a great experience, and though the prices are slightly more expensive than regular pub food, it's worth it. They had a creative menu that wasn't the same old - same old. I'll be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Been here a few times & I've always found it consistently good. The location is great: on the corner of 17th & 5th with a wrap-around patio. The food is good, even if it is a little pricey (they have daily specials too). Service was OK,  not bad, just not amazing. Their beer selection is large & the bar itself is very nice. I'd go again, if the service had been a bit better I'd even give this place a 4 or 5."}
{"text":"My sister beat me to reviewing The National first. So Ill just say, it will definately be up there in the running with all the new eateries on 17th Ave. 
The service was great. It was very busy on the Thursday early evening, and very loud, so not a \"first date\" kind of place. All types of clientel, from the buisness suits to the casual, shorts and tattoos crowd. 
The food was excellent. The four of us had only one complaint, that the pretzel bread ordered was a bit small for all the mustard and beer cheese provided.
Even if you dont get a table outside on the patio, being indoors is just as nice, due to the large floor to ceiling windows that are opened up when its sunny out. 
National also serves up a huge beer list ( as its a beer hall), plus a few selections of wines and spirits. 
Cant wait to go back and try more eats!"}
{"text":"Review : 3.8(ish)

The overall restaurant is fine. Service can take a while depending on the crowd. Patio has it toughest because the bussers and wait staff tend to it second after the crowd inside. The beer selection is alright. Decent selection. The menu can be a bit pricey, and depending on what you order, you may be a bit disappointed in the portions. But their daily specials are often great. Tuesdays it's oysters, and Wednesdays it's $5 for a pound of wings (~8-10 wings). 

Fair warning: do not drop in during a game/right before a game. You will most likely not find a seat, even though it's a communal restaurant (because all of the tables are already reserved or are preoccupied by other people.) The only real gripe I could have with this place is how long it took our food to get to the table and getting the staff's attention. I realise that they do indeed have other people to get to, so maybe having more staff on waiting tables would be nice. 

As for the 25 & over rule for the weekends, It is indeed illegal to discriminate anyone in Canada based off of their age. But it's also understandable to the restaurant owners. People under 25 can get out of sorts when in a bar, I'm not implying that people over 25 are immune to the effects alcohol has on their ability to make decisions, but I wouldn't want a 20 something trying to start a fight or trying to impress their friends by being a menace in my bar. I've never had to deal with this, though I am under 25, so I can't confirm whether or not this age discrimination is true or not. Perhaps they only turn away groups of men that look like they would pose a hazard for other bar patrons."}
{"text":"Brutal. Heat wasn't working and it was close to 0 inside and -20 outside. Out of items on the menu and 18% gratuity added to the bill automatically for a birthday party. This place sucks"}
{"text":"Communal seating in the land of douche bag and baggets? Yeah...no thanks! Walked out of this place and went next door to the ship."}
{"text":"Met my Dad and sis at National for dinner on Sunday evening. We got there at 5 pm and the patio and indoor area were both very busy. Just as we sat down inside, a big storm started and everyone from the patio had to come inside. Luckily we had our seats already! At this point, I think the indoor area was completely full. 

I tried the Chicken Club Sandwich and the Tree Blonde Lager. I love the variety of the drink menu and the options on drink sizes. The chicken sandwich was good, but I'm not a fan of ciabatta buns and the meat was a bit dry. Considering all of the other options on the menu, I probably wouldn't order it again until I've tried some of the other items. The deep fried jalapenos are calling my name ... 

The service was great and the food came out pretty quickly, even though they seemed to be at capacity. I love the look and atmosphere of the restaurant, but we all agreed that it would be too loud for mom to enjoy."}
{"text":"One of the best patios in Calgary for people watching! The servers are super cool and the beer selection is great."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I really do. 

But the service sucks. 

I could deal with the pricey menu if the service was passable. The food is delicious, the beer list is impressive, and the mixed drinks (especially their Pimm's cup) are fantastic. Not to mention their location is primo.

I've been here a number of times and not once can I say I have received adequate service. This most recent experience prompted me to write this review. The waitress more or less ignored half of our party, and the number of times she came to our table were few and far between. On top of that, they had the audacity to include a 19% or 20% gratuity on our bill without any indication prior to ordering. This pretty much guarantees that I will not return. If an auto-gratuity is going to be required, at least give service that is worthy of that much money."}
{"text":"If the walls of this place could speak they would yell \"Douche bags ahoy!\" Then peel themselves off the building and join you at the Ship next door.

The National is everything I hate about Toronto condensed and magnified through that distorted mirror image of a business trying to appeal to a crowd that doesn't live there.

Let's look at the facts;

- Decent selection of beer but the \"stock ticker\" style board is a pain in the ass to read because of how often it changes.

- Music so loud and bad that I honestly can't remember what was playing because my brain is trying to spare me from the painful memories.

- Rude/indifferent wait staff that weren't really concerned with a table of ten for some even though we drank (possibly too much) and ordered food.

- More Affliction t-shirts than a UFC fight in Vegas.

- Tiny bathrooms for a place that looks like it has a capacity of well over 200.

- Mediocre food with mismatched pricing. Pub food should be cheap, unless it's bad. This place had the double wammy; bland food that was too expensive.

Conclusion;
The good people of Calgary need a better beer hall. The expectation has been set so low that the National comes off as attractive."}
{"text":"Replacing the old, dark, once very popular Mercury Lounge, National brings in a bright, inviting new space to 17th Ave. This beer hall boasts a variety of seating arrangements with beautiful interior finishings. I was impressed with the way they made use of the space. They have lots of bar seating, group tables, and communal bench seating in the middle with numbers etched in each spot so that the wait staff knows where the food order goes. They have a decent variety of beers on the menu. I couldn't try many since I had to work the next morning, but I'll definitely come back because they have an eclectic list. The beer menu is organized by draughts and bottles, and then types such as \"crisp and clean,\" and \"red and hoppy,\" to steer non-beer connoisseurs in the right direction. Of course, they have options for non-beer drinkers too such as litre sized mason jars full of cocktails. Among the lists of beers, they have Rotational Selections which are written on the chalk boards and, obviously, rotated. I tried a Rotational Selection - the Rogue Irish Lager. It wasn't awesome... kind of tasted like feet. But that's okay, because there are probably better beers on the menu! You also get to pick the sizes: 14 oz, 20oz, Steins, and Flights.

They also offer salty snacks, a raw bar, sharing plates, burgers and sandwiches, a sweet menu, etc. It seems like a lot, but it wasn't an overwhelming menu. It felt like a decent selection without being redundant. I ordered the 2 bite corn dogs. They were made with yummy smokies and served with mustard and some kind of mayo dip (I think). It was delicious! I think three mini corn dogs was probably too much, but it would have been perfect to share with two other friends.

I had a great first experience. Since it's only a few blocks away from my new place and owned by a friend's cousin, I'll definitely be there a lot. Unfortunately, I can't give it a 5 stars yet because they need to earn it, but I am very happy to give it a solid 4 star rating! Yay, National!"}
{"text":"I went here for their NYE party and was extremely disappointed. For $50 I spent most of the night in a nearly empty bar with music that was deafening so I couldn't even carry a conversation with my friends. They served free food which was good, and had beer samples. But nothing else promised was there.

I was there with 6 people at a table and we were constantly passed by, when hats were given out, and more to my dismay when they were giving out champagne for the countdown. They walked right by ignoring is and gave us nothing, although our servers were constantly preoccupied by their own friends and boyfriends. They forgot to pay attention to the clients who paid $50 to be there.

To top the night off, after 10 they began letting people in for regular cover charge, so they received everything we did and we paid 5X the amount. 

Not impressed."}
{"text":"It is next to the ship and anchor.  Why would you go to to the National?? Well if the lineup at the ship is too long then ok , go to the national otherwise, what we're you thinking!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for brunch last week.  There's been lots of hype about this place, so I thought I should finally check it out.  
Now, they don't exactly have a brunch menu, they have 4 all day breakfast choices. When I asked if they had a brunch menu the hostess said yes, but then the waitress said not really.  Anyway, they do have a brunch special on the weekends I guess, but on that day it was stuffed french toast which I can't have because of gluten.  Ah well.

Pros:
Clean place, nice decor. Great atmosphere inside and an awesome patio outside.
Alright menu, beer selection alright
Service was ok

Cons:
No gluten free options (food or beer)
Beer prices expensive 
Food prices relatively expensive
Breakfast was nothing special - eggs not fully cooked, but the hashbrowns were good
Coffee press expensive - ordered 2 coffees, then looked at menu and realized their only option was a $5 press. Cancelled one of the coffees, I'm not paying $10 bucks for 2 coffees.  Was a little curious as to why she didn't mention it was a press and that we could have shared that amount of coffee.

I might go again, maybe I need to experience this place in the evening or something.  Or maybe I just came at a bad time of the day... I don't know.  I wasn't entirely turned off from the place, but I am in no rush to go back."}
{"text":"I'm giving only one star because of the service. Food and beer was great but the server Molly was not good at all. Not attentive at all, walking away before all questions were answered, not checking in on how we were doing, etc.. We took initial orders at 2:57 and she gave us a nasty look because we asked for the happy hour prices which are from 3-6. Maybe this was a one off thing but my first experience here wasn't pleasant."}
{"text":"I went to 17th ave this afternoon with a friend with the intent of trying out a place we have never been to before. We came across The National. Great atmosphere with big windows and rustic decor. A very enjoyable place to people watch. 

I ordered a beer and their burger and we shared a poutine. 

They had a ton of beers which seemed to be a great selection. I am not a beer person but I was hoping to have a Richards White but they didnt have it. But our waitress had a great recommendation for me anyway! 

Their burger was fine but in all honesty nothing special or memorable except for the big price tag of $13, not including any extras like cheese or bacon. The waitress asked how we wanted our burger cooked and we had it medium well and it was cooked wonderfully. They do grind their meat fresh, however this was not enough to deliver an incredible burger. In fact the tomatoes were cut too thick and for some reason I couldn't seem to bite through the lettuce, which was really weird! I kept yanking the whole lettuce out of the bun with every bite. Annoying!! 2.5 stars for the burger! 

For $10 you can buy their really incredibly delicious poutine! YUM. The cheese and the gravy was fab and not too salty but flavorful and it looked as though there was some finely ground pepper on it, but I didn't really taste pepper. I give the poutine 5 stars! Yum! the best poutine I've had in Calgary so far!"}
{"text":"I went here with my sister on a sunday afternoon. It was pretty busy, but we were greeted and seated promptly. 

We started with a beer each, I got the huckleberry and I don't remember what she got because mine was incredible. I ordered the lobster poutine, which was very impressive. Big pieces of actual lobster, and a cream sauce. Could have used a little more garlic and lemon, but it was still amazing. 

My sister got the porchetta sandwich, (sorry for poor spelling, I don't feel like googling it) and it was delicious. The french fries were also delicious. 

The service was amazing. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went this afternoon with two friends. Ordered food, and ONE HOUR later server comes by to say \"The kitchen is busy, it'll be coming soon\". Fifteen minutes later she comes by to say the same thing. We ask her to check how long it will be and she goes, comes back, and says \"At least another half hour\". We got up and left. Awful, never again."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio today & had a great experience! Loved the fact that the picnic tables are community so you can grab a seat at the end of any table & still feel comfortable. Service was fast & friendly with lots of advice on how to modify the menu to your liking. Would consider this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Badass lobster poutine and a freakin dope beer list. Great vibes in this place"}
{"text":"I've been to National a few times. I've eaten food/consumed beer inside, outside and have also attended a private event.

I have mixed feelings about the community seats. As other reviewers have said, don't try to have a private conversation. Because people will be listening. It is one thing being a pair at one end of the table with another pair at the end. But when 3 or more try to join your table...well I'm not sure how I feel about that.

The beer selection is pretty great. Something for everyone and then some. The wine selection is fairly ample for a pub too, although I haven't tried it to know the quality.

Which brings us to the food. Burgers (beef as well as the turkey) are great although on both occasions the bun has fallen apart before I was halfway through. They have great flavour and are cooked really well. I also like that you have the option of a healthy side green salad or fries, depending on how calorie conscious you are being. I've had a few of their appies as well...good but nothing stand out.

Service...pretty attentive but not overly friendly. They seem really rushed all the time, like they are short staffed.

I do like the wrap around patio although 17th Ave traffic can sometimes drown out conversation. With all the windows, it can get quite warm on the inside on a sunny day (even in the cooler weather)."}
{"text":"I preface this by saying I have only gone here once in the evening,  and I think it was a Wednesday. Mostly,  I go there for boozy brunch on weekends. For that,  it is awesome. I love how the space has so many windows to let it the sunlight,  and their beer selection is pretty good. I went there for oysters once, and that was also fun- not sure if I'd want to brave it on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"In an effort to take over Calgary with interesting bars and restaurants, the owners of Model Milk give us National.

Complete with popcorn for your table, tatter tots with Franks Red hot dipping sauce, floor to ceiling windows with views of 17th Ave and long picnic tables forcing you to mingle with strangers, National is a pub rethought, and I like it.

National is loud, clangy, huge and crowded with a beer menu that is extensive, sourcing all their brew as locally as possible, and their food menu impressive featuring great salads mixed with old-fashioned bar favorites like pickled eggs and nuts and all-day breakfast. 

Although the beer and food selection is striking, they neglected to put as much love into the cocktails and wine lists, leaving the occasional beer drinker a bit lost. I wish I could give National 3.75 stars, since this stumble only deserves 0.25 marks off a four-star review; but alas, it cannot be overlooked.

I don't think I will be a bar-fly on the wall at this place since I like a little more selection for drinking and I only occasionally like to be accosted by strangers in a pub; But when I am looking for beer, I like the beer selection at National, the crowd it attracts, the location it sits in and the food on the offer, so I think I'll make a habit of going to here, sometimes.

{"text":"Went here for a drink while waiting for a reservation somewhere else. I love the high ceilings. Had a long Island iced tea, it was good. Prices are average, what you'd expect. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by National which I visited on a Monday evening. I had a Mill Street Cobblestone stout and the Prime Rib sandwich. I also shared the chicken pot pie.

I really enjoyed the Cobblestone. It was my first time trying it and it is on par with my favourite beer Boddingtons. The Prime Rib was great as it came with hot mustard with arugula inside. I love a sandwhich that makes me almost cry and give me arugula as a treat. The Chicken pot pie was excellent though hardy. I would suggest not biting into it right away though because it was very hot when we received it. Burned my tongue a bit. 

I really love the space that the National has developed. Save one white pillar in the middle everything is open here with communal seating in the middle. The large screen with airport-style of beer display behind the bar make it possible to not need to open your menu. It is fitting that this place be next door to the ship because really they are opposites. Though sometimes I prefer a place with more nooks and crannies, the national is place where I could spend a lot of money. Loved my experience!"}
{"text":"Checked out National on 17th Ave for the first time on St. Patrick's Day. We called only a couple hours ahead and made a reservation for 8 and they fit us in no problem. Our server was great and even though she was run off her feet, she still made an effort to chat with us whenever she swung by our table.

Beer selection was impressive and they had a wonderful organic lager on special, rather than the usual Bud or Bud Light.

I ordered the Glory Bowl, perfectly cooked veggies and large pieces of tofu. However, it was a tad pricey for the serving size, which is why I don't give National a full five stars. 

Will definitely return, maybe on half priced appies night!"}

Today on such a nice sunny day I went down to National on 17th the patio was very busy but there was not one person inside.  I decided to sit at a bench in side and 15 mins past almost 20 mins and no one person came over to see was I having any drinks or Lunch. After leaving the place I called to let them know how crap it feels that as a customer you no longer matter.  I spoke to TJ an owner / manager he seemed very nice and assured me in 5 years this has never happened.  Now in the past I have been a big fan of National and have been there many times but now there is so many places to choose from."}

I do the first and second on my first trip here.
Being an out-of-towner this was a fun place to enjoy a cold beverage while chatting with a co-worker and getting to feel like I was out in it, and a part of the town.  This feels like a hardcore local spot and I am glad it's so inviting at the same time.

The beer selection was great, and we even got our table neighbors extra fries that they mysteriously had show up at their table, and more mysteriously decided to give to us!  Yes!

Next time I'm on the 'Red Mile' I'll want to come back for sure."}
{"text":"This location is much smaller compared to the one on 10th.

They have a great beer selection. This is a great place to start the night off. It's not so great if you feel like dancing or hanging out for a while since there's not much sitting space, and not much else to do other than watching a game on TV.

The servers were pretty good considering how busy the place is.

Overall, a decent bar."}

The atmosphere was very loud and our service was just ok."}
{"text":"My sister told me about \"buck a shuck\" at National so my boyfriend and I decided to come check it out. 
Uhm, yum!! Not only is it $1 per oyster, it's also happy hour on beer. 
I have to say that we went a bit crazy on the oysters. Oysters were the one thing I was craving in my pregnancy (and probably one of the biggest things you're not allowed to eat) so I was slurpin back oysters like there was no tomorrow. I was impressed, pretty good oysters!! 
My boyfriend tried the fried chicken as well, he enjoyed it and ended up ordering more. Not bad for fried chicken (doesn't come close to Jollibee for those who have had that delicious chicken goodness). 
Onto the beer. Sooooooooo good. Again, I haven't enjoyed a beer for 9 months, so I was just happy to be drinking a cool beer on a hot summer day. Great variety, great selection, and everything on tap. 

I'll be back for the buck a shuck!"}

I live across the street so was stoked to find a new watering hole that wasn't the ship...that place is growing tiredsome to me. It's super trendy, the decor is great, floor to ceiling windows lots of light, great ambiance. 

The server we had (I want to say Amber??) she was awesome, she had a little cheat sheet with the beers that helped her describe over 100 of them. She was friendly and personable. The only thing she didn't mention (which I noticed on other people's reviews this wasn't an issue) she didn't ask us how we wanted our burger done and assumed med rare...eeeekk!! I like my steak that way but prefer my burgers well done. When I brought it up to her she did explain they grind their meat in house and offered to remake it (she genuinely wanted me to have a good burger rather than roll her eyes and be upset about it)...I hate taking food back but in this case I just couldn't eat a raw burger. I almost lost my appetite but glad I didn't because the burger was AWESOME!! However...the price tag was about $17 after I added bacon and cheese with no side...ouch!

The beer is amazing...great selection and lot of things to try if you are a beer enthusiast...they have sample platters (great presentation) for the beer if you'd like to try a few. Again the beer is about $8.5/pint a bit pricey in my mind and I live on 17th ave. I'd say it's like Wurst and Craft combined...I\"ll go to National here and there, but it's steep prices don't enable me to be a regular there :("}
{"text":"Good selection but could use some more stouts and porters.  They had some weak beer and would be better of serving more craft brews."}
{"text":"Great special. Can be very busy on a nice day on the weekend. All the food has been good so far. Beer specials are good too b"}
{"text":"National was the chosen spot last Saturday for some birthday shenanigans. Thank goodness we got here by 8pm because there was already a lineup forming at the door! Craziness!!

We found a spot at the benches and squeezed 6 of us into a 4-person spot and reassured the troubled-looking waiter that \"we'll be fiiiine!\". Cozy is good, right? But soon our group grew and the group at the table next to us left, so we gradually expanded and took over both spots. This was probably a good thing because most of the people in my party were partaking in some kind of unofficial alcohol olympics, and would very likely scare off innocent leisure-drinkers if they found themselves in our proximity. 

I liked the menu! The food list was big and varied, and looked delicious. The beer list was even bigger! Too bad I was the DD for that evening or I would have tried several of them! 

The place is modern, fresh and energetic, yet still keeping the 'beer hall' feel. Absolutely loved the huge windows and slim white brick walls with slim chalkboards with beers listed on them. NICE work on the decor! The patio is also huge! It wraps all the way around 17th ave and 5th St! 

The service was decent, nothing to complain about! 

National is all in all a fun place. I would go back and try more of their beers. And split the 'Deep fried Mars bar' with said birthday boy because although I promised that to him at the beginning of our meal, it was all quickly lost in a frenzy of Steamwhistle, He'Brew, St Ambroise, Jamesons, Jaeger and pickle juice."}
{"text":"Scotch eggs. The moment I heard that National had scotch eggs, with soft yolks, I knew that this place was worth checking out. Right next to the Ship & Anchor, National is yet another jewel in the crown for Calgary's famous strip. So what sets National apart from other bars and eateries on 17th Avenue? 

How about the food? The first thing I noticed when I first heard of this place was that the Scotch eggs were served hot with a soft yolk. By simply changing this one detail, the whole experience of eating a Scotch egg is transformed. Simplicity, common sense and imagination take a traditionally common food item, which is normally eaten cold with a hard boiled egg and transform it into something extraordinary and pleasurable.

It was also a pleasant surprise to learn that the burgers at National are made with house ground beef, which is hand chopped. This extra step in quality not only ensures the freshness of the finished product, but also gives the diner a rare opportunity, or should I say 'medium rare'. Yes, it's not often that you can order a burger these days that's medium rare, but here you can, and I can honestly say it's been too long. 

The 'thrice-cooked' fries are crisp and fresh, delicately salted and very good on their own. The fact that they are 'thrice cooked' is awesome considering that many places don't even cook their fries twice.

The Roasted Chicken Club was a very generous serving of very flavourful white and dark meat in a ciabatta bun, topped with a spicy sriracha mayo, cheese and sliced pickle. The mayo has a nice, but not too overwhelming kick that complements the taste of the meat. If you're not a burger fan, this one is definitely a good alternative. If you have a light appetite, it's perfect for sharing.

Also a nice notable detail in both sandwiches was the immense quarter slice of dill pickle. I love pickles on the side and these are nice and big.

The drink selection here is very good, featuring a vast menu of beers, local and beyond. Cocktails, I didn't have the opportunity to sample on this visit, but seemed to be popular as well. 

The space is large, open concept with lots of seating, including a large amount of communal tables in the center of the space, perfect for people watching. If you want to catch the game, there are a line of TVs lining the length of the huge bar. Decor is rustic, but clean and contemporary. I find that it's comfortable, inviting and the perfect place to chill out.

Next time you're in the neighbourhood, be sure to check out National, try a Scotch egg and have a great time."}
{"text":"Best beer happy hour period. A REAL pint - 20oz - for $5. Great patio and people watching. How can you go wrong. Only issue is they don't play sports."}
{"text":"Busy on a Saturday night, but Sabz and her crew of nutty Québécois (and me!) were able to squeeze in and drink National dry. I'm sorry if you were unable to find National on Sunday morning, because we DRANK IT.

Oh, and FYI, the menu on their website is out of date. They actually *do* have a veggie burger on their menu and it's delicious! Crumbly and messy; I wound up eating it with a fork and knife, but that didn't take away from it's flavor. 

The music that they play on Saturday nights reminds me of my iPod!"}

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

National is a fairly new beer hall that opened up next to The Ship and Anchor on 17th Ave. It is always packed on the weekend so I was glad my friends and I found a couple of seats along their oyster bar. As the concept of 'beer hall' suggests, National has long communal (picnic-like) tables for customers, or you can grab a seat at their beautiful bar where display boards rotate through their beers on tap. It's very spacious inside and they have an equally large open patio. 

National has over 36 bottles and 70 different draught beers including Pale & Dark Ales, Lagers, and Hoppy ones. I was a little disappointed by the selection because they were all North American microbrews and a pint was considerably expensive compared to other places: $6/14 oz; $8.50/20oz; $14/Stein; $15/Flight. A bottle can run up to $15 for 650ml to $30 for those with a higher alcohol content. 

My friends and I opted to share a 1L 'Strawberry Lemonade' cocktail ($15) with vodka, strawberry, and homemade lemonade. If you love girly drinks, this is the one to get because it was refreshing and deliciously lemony. 

Their menu is reminiscent of a gastropub with gourmet items including oysters; ($3) in-house made salty snacks like spiced nuts and pickled eggs; ($9-$14) appetizers like mussels, beef tartare, and pretzels; ($18) pot pies; ($10-$16) duck and lobster poutines; ($15) prime rib and porchetta sandwiches; ($13) hamburgers, and unique desserts like a deep fried mars bar! They even serve a whole roasted pig for parties if you order ahead.

My friends and I tried their 'Traditional Poutine' ($10) which was very disappointing. The fries were soggy, the chicken gravy was bland, and there wasn't enough cheese curds. However, the 'Key Lime Cheesecake' ($8) with honey comb and raspberry sorbet made up for it. The cheesecake had the right amount of tartness, a nice thin graham cracker crust, and a buttery texture. In general, their food is presented beautifully with care on rustic wooden cutting boards. 

I also had the advantage of sitting next to the oyster bar and kitchen so I saw a lot of the snacks being prepared and food come out. I suggest avoiding the salty snacks portion of the menu since they give you a very small portion and there wasn't anything unique about them. For anyone who is interested, the popcorn is you usual popcorn from a machine and you only get two pickled eggs (four halves) per order.

My overall experience at National was just OK. It didn't really live up to the hype and I would have preferred to see a wider range of import drafts. Nonetheless, if you haven't checked out National yet, I suggest you drop by on a slower night. The atmosphere is lively and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I was here during the World Cup matches. The place was packed and they still made room for us just in time to watch the match. The food was delicious and the drinks were equally as good."}
{"text":"This location is not up to the standards of the others in the city. We've been here twice, and that's enough. One thing I will never understand is a server who forgets about a table who has no beer. Beer is a great way to drive revenue at your pub, hence most servers come by before you're even done. This one forgot about us for lengths at a time, on a day where it was very quiet in the restaurant. 

We had a few friends who ordered food. Two were forgotten, one got the wrong order, and the other was charged for something complete different than what they received. One of the two that never got their food (1 hour wait) just cancelled, the other said she'd still take it but just bring it to go as we wanted to just leave. Of course, it was not brought to-go. At this point the situation was just funny. More of a cringey nightmare than anything.

In summary: Forgot orders, brought the wrong orders, ignored requests, overcharged, forgot about the table, and then still wanted to point out to us that \"that doesn't cover the tip\". Right. Not going back here. Extremely poor management. 

We should all demand more out of our pubs!"}
{"text":"I should have came here first before going to the National on 10th street and then my review won't be so biased.

This place is still worth the visit. The patio is nice and large and right on 17th. The food is delicious. The beer list? lacking compared to the new National on 10th. 

Came here to grab some lunch during the weekend. It was nice how busy it felt and the people watching was great."}
{"text":"READER BEWARE: I am probably going to offend most people with this review, but if I were to describe National in one word, it would be WEIRD!

Just a random night out with a couple friends, started at Rose and Crown to watch our buddies band play, then someone said there was duck perogies at National, so we headed there. It was duck poutine, not perogies and they wouldn't serve us food anyways, as we got there just before 11, but by the time our server got to us it was 11:03 and they stopped serving food at 11. Are you kidding me?! I can see if we popped in at 11:30, but we were there before 11. Anywho. 

We're sitting enjoying our drink and noticing the crowd. It feels like we're at the Met on Stephen Ave. The new corporate watering hole with a side of hipsters, hippies and I'm not even sure what else. Oh and to the guy passed out, probably puking under the table next to us, GO HOME!!! You're wearing a wedding band and you're still in your work clothes. Get a grip. It's Thursday night. 

So after a drink, we got out of there and the general consensus is to not add that to the top 10 list, not even the top 20."}
{"text":"Beer - Great
Service - Okay
Steak Sandwich - Awful

Decided to grab a beer and a bite at National before one of the Flames preseason games. Came in during their shift change (5:30-6ish), so they only had one girl serving the entire place. She brought us our beer, and said our actual server would be starting 'shortly'. It was a while before we could flag our new server down to refill our pints and take our food order. Once we had her attention however, she did a good job.

DO NOT ORDER THE STEAK SANDWICH. 

I know not to expect A+++ AMAZING PRIME beef when I order a steak sandwich, but I do expect it to be edible and cooked properly. This was neither. I ordered medium rare, it came out looking like ahi tuna. The steak had long stringy gristly things throughout and I couldn't cut through them. I  asked the server if I could get another one, and she was very apologetic and said a whole new plate would be on its way. Once the new steak arrived, I cut into it to see that it was very, very well done. 0/2 on the steaks. 

My advice, stick to the drinks and appetizers if you're going to eat here. Pretty hard to screw up popcorn."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the beers they had on tap! I have celiac so I can't drink them but they did have some ciders on tap. I had their chicken wings and tater tots and it was a perfect bar snack to have!  I went on wing night and for 5 bucks you do get a lot. I had the sweet chili flavour and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Came in for a pre-game drink and light dinner, and we weren't disappointed. While the menu is a bit pricey, the Sunday specials made it well within reason (half-price apps and $6 pints). 

Beer selection was massive - about 100 on tap - and the two dishes we had were great. The traditional poutine was one of the best we've ever had, and very rich. The sliders were also fantastic, and I'd highly recommend that combo to anyone. 

Service was good too, and I'd return for sure."}
{"text":"I like you National. We began our night on a rough note as I stood in line for 15 minutes impatiently tapping my foot. Yeah I know you are the hottest thing on 17th Ave but soon enough, something hotter will come along and you'll be teasing me  and whatever joe shmoe that comes within your proximity. In fact I came by myself so when I say \"I'm here to join a group of friends that have saved a spot for me\" and when one of them comes up to let you know...let me in!

Finally when I walked in I get why everyone wants to flock to this place. It has a different vibe than any beer hall in the city. They have a great selection and I'd love to talk about the different beers I tried, but Sabz's BF Chris made sure I remembered very little of that night :/

Still I do remember snippets. Our waitress was super awesome.
Despite having a small selection of spirits and liquor, they were able to put together strange shots for us. I kept having to gargle this weird mix of Jamesons and Jaeger and they even managed to put together a whiskey shot chased with pickle juice for our crew.

I didn't' get a chance to try their food because it seems that at around 10pm, the kitchen closes. 

There is a friendly vibe to this place. The large tables make it easy to huddle with your friends and ignore society but give you the option of turning around and making friendly conversation with a stranger. At the end of the night more people stand around the bar area where one could take a bar stroll towards and randomly spark conversations.

Drunk enough I like to pull out a classic conversation starter:

\"HEY GUYS WOAH BIG GULPS HUH? WELL SEE YOU LATER!\""}
{"text":"Some cool unique drinks with a fun laid back atmosphere, service can be a little spotty when they get busy but overall pretty fun place to grab drinks."}
{"text":"Easily the best bar so far in Calgary. The concept is awesome. Love that train ticker with the beer selection. It's simply a memorable place. Not sure what the crowd is like on the weekends, but it seems like a mix of suits and locals. Haven't tried the food, but it's only a matter of time."}
{"text":"The great Calgarian Beer Hall! It's places like National that have helped turn beer geekyness into total awesomeness and changed the whole vibe around what it means to go out in Calgary. National is styley enough that you won't feel out of place if you're still donning your power tie from the that international deal you closed like a boss earlier that day and are now pounding back pints with with your colleagues. And it's casual enough that you'll still feel at home in a pair of jeans and your best ironic moustache.

I gotta say, I'm a pretty big fan of the picnic table style seating that National is known for. You just get a little more interaction with the people around you. Believe it or not, 9 times out of 10 your neighbours will turn out to be pretty decent humans and you'll wind up making some new beer friends, even if only for the next hour. At the very least you go, \"Excuse me, is anyone sitting here?\" and they go \"No, go ahead.\" Crack. That little bit of ice is broken.

The beer selection is... I believe the correct term is \"off the heezy\", possibly \"hizzle\", I'm not sure, but it's really really good. It's broken up by category so you can go with a type you love and then go to town. And if you REALLY want to go to town, they've got \"Session Sundays.\" $6.50 20oz pints of EVERYTHING. Village Brewery Blonde? $6.50. Rogue IPA? $6.50. Bud lite? GET OUT.

Scotch Egg - This is a wonderful piece of beer hall food I happened upon last night. It's a soft boiled egg coated in in sausage and breading and then deep fried for $5. It's a great little one person snack for when you get the munchies. It's also a pretty good conversation starter. People can't fight the mystique of the scotch egg. They'll ask you about it with a slightly jealous curiosity and it's not big enough that you'll feel obligated to share with your friends."}
{"text":"Chic atmosphere, great for hipsters. Little tvs (thank god; why is it ever bar in Calgary needs to have these massive loud intrusive TVs?) good food and excellent craft drinks. I only wish prices were more reasonable. Still worth it."}
{"text":"I am only reviewing from my one super lame experience at National, be forewarned.

But for reals, we arrived on a Wednesday night and no one was at the door to greet us. We were finally seated at a giant table that we \"shared\" with someone else and waited 20 minutes for a server to attend to us, and after trying all we could to flag someone, we just left. 

The hostess now at the door didn't even acknowledge us as we left."}
{"text":"Very lively during happy hour. I love the patio spot facing sunset. Best place to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"I've been to National on 17th a couple of times, and frankly am underwhelmed.  In theory, National has the potential to be a great spot.  

For me, a great pub needs the following:

1) Ample seating and no lines - National 17th does not have this - it is a pretty small space, and you are packed into picnic-style tables surrounded by randoms (note: do not try to have a private conversation at this pub).

2) Good music to get the party started, but not so loud that you can't hear yourself think and need to scream at your date/friends - National 17th does not have this.  The last time I went, I ended up TEXTING my date so we could have a conversation.  Thankfully the date was not a total bomb and we are still together almost 9 months later (note: I have not been back to National since this date).

3) Great beer and pub food selection - Check!  National does have an awesome beer menu and yummy pub snacks.

I think the 17th Ave location is on the small side for the crowd it draws in, so I'm very interested in checking out the 10th Ave location to see if it has more capacity."}
{"text":"On our first night in Calgary, we decided to head up to  17th Avenue in downtown.  This pocket of the neighborhood is known for its patio bars and restaurants, so there were plenty of places to choose from.  Eventually the crowd and patio at NATIONAL made us choose this resturant.  Inside, the ambience is is interesting; long wooden patio style table with attached benches all around, long bar counters, electonic billboard menus of all their beers on tap, open concept, dim lighting, etc.  Its truly a one of a kind, and I see why this place can draw many patrons.
Since we ate earlier my coworker and I settled for their local draught and shared their Lamb Sausage pizza.  When this dish came out, though it had a gamey type of smell it tasted awesome! ingredients used was quite unique; tzatziki sauce, mint, topped off with zuchinni strings.  
Overall we both took a chance on this dish, and it paid off! the presentation was bang-on! our server was great! the ambience is great.
National is definitely a hotspot on 17th avenue...but if you're looking for coziness, or a nice quiet place to eat, this should not be your venue of choice, but great place overall if you're with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Hit up the National if you want great beer and decent food at an average price.

The National is a quite loud beer hall with big long bench style seating as well as a few smaller tables with chairs. We started out our meal with the jalapeno fritters and the soft pretzels. The jalapeno fritters came with 5 medium sized fritters with a side of dip. I really enjoyed the fritters as the separation between with the fritter flavor and the jalapeno flavors were obvious and still worked well together. I enjoyed the soft pretzel more, however, as I will always be a huge fan of soft pretzels. The pretzels at the national were about the size of my palm and were slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was salted quite well and served with some type of butter that I found to be quite good. The pickles and pickled onions that were served alongside the pretzels were nice as well.

Next up were the main courses. I ordered the prime rib. The first impression I had was awe at the size of the portion of meat I received. The beef slab was served on top of a bed of potatoes, carrots, and beets. There was also a large Yorkshire pudding on the plate. I was disappointed that there was no gravy with the dish, so I would suggest ordering that. Also I was surprised at how cold my meat had gotten by the time it was served to me. If you're going to serve that size of prime rib, please look into getting better/more spicy horseradish! The Yorkshire would have been better with gravy and the vegetables were good. Overall the meal was still above average but you have to pay for that serving size. I also enjoyed the drinks I was served and we received good service all night, about the level you would expect. 

Overall, the National is good place to grab some beers or dinner if you don't mind the noise and select menu."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place. It was waaay better when it first opened. They used to have the best fish tacos in the city. Super fresh and not deep fried. But recently was back there and the fish tacos are now battered and fried :( I also don't like that the cocktails come in these teenie tiny minuscule cups. The wine portions are pretty brutal for a $12 glass of cab. If you love beer and burgers, this place would be right up your alley."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service wasn't. Our waitress was never around and took forever to bring out our drinks and the restaurant wasn't even busy. She also charged us for 4 alcoholic drinks, so they were expensive, that we didn't order. On top of that, she put an automatic tip onto our bill without telling any of us. We would have been fine with it if she had warned us about it, but it felt like a bit of a con because we got bad service and were forced to unknowingly tip 15%. Some of us realized too late that she had put the automatic tip on, so they tipped her on top of it, unfortunately.  
The food was really good though. I had the 3 mini burgers and a side of salad and was very happy with it."}
{"text":"I just didn't like it here, the space was uncomfortable. I like the community seating but i felt that it was a bit contrived here.  Maybe because the rest of the place is so pristine, overall not what i look for in a restaurant/bar/wannabe-brewhaus.

Beer list is good"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick dinner and drinks on a friday night. 

First patio session of the season on a warm evening! Great beer selection and the 4 of us ended up splitting the Lobster Poutine, Duck nuggets and one of the pizzas. 

Friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"Sunny Saturday on the patio!

Excellent beer selection. Love the nibblies! We had deep fried pickles, and tater tots to complement our Rogue beers. Delish. I also had a small clam chowder, which was creamy and yum, but a bit thin for my liking. I love a chunky chowder. The food that was coming out around us looked delicious, albeit a bit pricey for the portions.

Our server was pretty good, wait time was fine. Thought the patio was a bit cramped though. We sat at a two-top, and you had to sit sideways to eat. Meh. Next time we will sit inside, cause it looked fabulous and open. Beautiful decor."}
{"text":"I'm a total Fan! This place has a GREAT atmosphere, easy to meet people and the Staff is the absolute BEST! LOVE THEM! Make sure to try the Poutine, Oysters on Tuesdays or if you're hungover the breaky is YUM too~"}
{"text":"I come to the National on average 1-2x/week between 17ave, 10ave, and Stephen Ave.
We tend to frequent 17 ave ONLY based on location. 
The service is generally a 3 star, sometimes worse. In the summer the service use to be pretty good but since then their 2 best servers have jumped ship.
On Jan 30th I was here with friends for happy hour, my boyfriend had placed an order in to get 1 more beer on happy hour pricing. When the bill came it was billed at the regular $8.50 price, not a big deal, right? Think again. He showed the error to our server and asked for it to the HH price as it was ordered prior to 6pm, she said word for word \"Maybe if you ask me nicely\"  (Who says that!?) You may think that she was joking, nope. She just stared him down until he asked again if it could be changed or if he needed to speak to the Manager. She stormed off, returned with the revised bill and he kindly and quietly suggested to her that she could have handled that situation better to which she replied 'Yeah, well so could have you\" in a very rude tone. Our entire table was in awe at her rudeness and mind you we only had 3 beers each so no one by any means was drunk or belligerent. 
We have also had servers argue when we once in a while receive an under carbed beer that needs to be returned. 
I would give the National 17 ave a 5 star based on their daily 3-6 happy hour special and for selection of beers (which are unfortunately more local vs American, but I get the margin conversation, I get it) but due to the rudeness of the staff this drops to a 3."}
{"text":"We visited here not too long ago and went out with our cousins and friends for a bit of Sunday Funday action. Foodwise we ordered several dishes - and everything I ate had really good presentation. To drink, I ordered a moscow mule which was made really well. 

Overall, I had a blast. What I didn't like was the staff - though our server/waitress was fine and nice enough. We asked several waitresses a question about wifi and they were dismissive and not really helpful. Had the staff just been overall more helpful I would have rated this higher because this is a great spot to hang out at otherwise."}
{"text":"Went there mid week for a bite after work.  Luckily I was there for the $1 oyster night. The bar was not busy so the service was fast and efficient. The bartender really pointed me in the right beer direction. It is nice to have some samples before you commit to a pint. I also ordered the burger.  It was clear that the beef was fresh. I really enjoyed it. All in all the service and food were excellent."}
{"text":"Hit up National on a busy, jam packed Friday night. Place is huge and they have long communal tables for people to eat and meet each other. They also have a ping pong table and two foosball tables in the back! For free - WHAT.

Anyways, I met up with my sis and a few of her friends and they ordered a couple things:

- Fish tacos ($16) - grilled fish with cabbage, pico de gallo, coleslaw and fries. These were fresh and my sis really liked everything.
- Traditional poutine ($10) - comes with chicken gravy dips and fresh curds on your poutine. I'm not a big poutine fan but they were your average poutine you get in good 'ol Alberta.
- National cobb salad ($16) - crab (fake crab that is), bacon, egg, avocado, radish, tomato and blue cheese dressing. So the story is we actually ordered  roaster beet  and arugula salad but our waitress brought out the wrong one. Place was way too busy so we didn't get it changed (first mistake). The salad was BAD. Blue cheese dressing was overpowering and worst of all, it was smothered in so much dressing that it made the salad unbearable to eat. Yuck, yuck, yuck.

So lesson learned - don't get the salad, stick with the tacos looked good. I cleraly took one for the team by eating that salad. Stick to drinking here and I think you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Great place to visit and have beer and pub food.
They have big long tables, so you will be sharing the table with more people but that might be actually a good opportunity to make new friends.
They have inside and outdoor seating, whatever you feel more comfortable with.
There is a big beer variety, the server will be able to suggest something good for your taste.
I also learned they have buck-a-shuck on Tuesdays, so I'll be going to check them out :)"}
{"text":"I can only attest to the beer since we got there too late and the kitchen was closed.  They have an AMAZING beer selection...  Being from California, this was the kind of bar I was looking for - selection!  We ended up sitting next to a girl at the bar that worked there and she was there just having fun...  She was SO helpful and let us to the right beers to try on their \"flight\" (sample paddle).  
If I ever get back to Calgary, I'm coming here again.  I'm actually trying to get over there before leaving in a couple of days.  
CHEERS to National!!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer, excellent venue, big place and suitable for bigger groups, usually crowded, happening and loud. All this make an excellent pub!"}
{"text":"I am classically disappointed with the situation of this bar. The feeling is a pub that is fun for the successful, but in order to maintain this status, they disallow hats or torn jeans or other unacceptable clothing. Generally I wouldn't have any issues with this, but you have to see the precident they are trying to set when you first enter!  I laughed out loud when I saw the door staff wearing jeans and a hoodie, telling the guy in front of me in line that his factory-torn True Religion Jeans were not allowed in.

They have a fantastic bar selection and lots on tap. Too bad the staff have an issue over what you wear. I wore a hat on my visit as I was going on the patio, however that is not allowed.  The idea of a hat is to protect from the sun, and not to reflect your affluence."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of colleagues who happens to be in town from Vancouver. I ordered  their dry pop and the roasted chicken. I loved the roasted chicken it has a nice smoking taste to it. Not to mention the best part is the gravy. Its very unique. $19 get you half a chicken with salad and fries. The fries are not bad. I had left over and interestingly, the chicken taste even better next day.

The atmosphere here is nice. It is a pub and can be quite loud. 

Service is ok. You run out of water and it takes them awhile to notice it. Beer and alcohol selection is lengthy. Only issue is that there are not a lot of selection for non-alcoholic drinks.

Overall, I like this place. Great to meet up with friends here."}
{"text":"Don't order the fish and chips, the fish was mushy and the chips were sub par.  My husbands pepperoni and mushroom flatbread was greasy. Beer and selection was good. It is a blue collar style of pub with fair prices but with all the places to go in Calgary I doubt that we will give it a return visit."}
{"text":"I had been itching to try this place since it opened, and then i found out they had mini corn dogs, and popcorn on the menu and i was sold. Went on a Wednesday night at 6:30, and it was super packed, but they were able to squeeze us in at the oyster bar, which i honestly didn't mind at all.
 
I ordered the Cesar Salad ( corn dogs will be on my cheat weekends- because i will be coming back!)- Salad was delicious, but FULL of garlic, so if you re going out later and don't want to be stinky, pass on this one. There were huge shavings of parm cheese, and giant chunks of bacon. My GF ordered 3 oysters and our server was nice enough to bring her an extra one for free. She said the oysters were delicious and very fresh tasting. 

Also ordered a few vodka waters, and they were served in mason jars! I LOVE MASON JARS! haha.

The people here were 25-35 crowd, seemed like young professionals. I really liked it, and love their menu options, but our server was very slow, ( so slow to the point where we had to flag him on several occasions) so i do need to knock it down 1 star for that reason."}
{"text":"Great happy hour (3-6). Met a gf for drinks Monday during happy hour. We enjoyed the discounted tacos and I had a fabulous margarita blended drink that was on special for $7 normally $13. Def recommend the patio. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Alright, National. You're up for review! 

National is... well, kind of weird. But I like it. What do I think is weird about it? When you have menu items like corn dogs and tater tots on the menu alongside your fancy-pants beer selection, frankly, I find that a little weird. But I like your two bite corn dogs, so, I'm not complaining. Just calling you a little out of the ordinary. Maybe that's why we're getting along so far. 

The other \"out-of-the-ordinary\" menu items I'm on board with:
- beer cheese and pretzel bread
- duck poutine
- fried mars bar

I like your big windows and your patio, though we need to add at least another kilometre worth of patio space in this city in general. Whenever a place has a good sunny spot, it's bound to be packed no matter what! 

I also like that you've got the beer menu printed at each table. Though you've got the big beer board up behind the bar, it's hard to see that far when you're sitting across the room (or maybe it's time for me to go see an optometrist!). So good thinking on having it at the tables for us!

Some people say your food and beer are a bit expensive for what they're getting. I don't find you out of price line with other spots in town. 

Now... about that private party room in the back?!?

Things to consider: Most tables are long bench seating. Expect to share!

Specials: Tuesdays, $1 oysters!"}
{"text":"Like their snack-y items.  where can u find corn dogs, raw oysters, scotch egg, and lobster/duck poutine?! hehe.
Cool little ticker type  menu boards
picnic table / mess hall set up.
Crowded, loud, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Home of the best damn beer guzzling happy hour in this city... with real 20 oz pints- something that is near to extinction in Calgary sadly."}
{"text":"Lunch with a buddy, dam good food and conversation. Love to come back at night....... Date night, looks like it hops"}
{"text":"Brutal:
Great location, great facility, clean bathroom.

The service was the worst I've had in years, maybe ever. It took 90 minutes from the time I entered the establishment to the time I left. I had a ceasar salad and a water.
How...?  How...?   How...?   Could this order take over 60 minutes to prepare. Most establishments want to turn over the table and get the next customer.

The salad itself was wilted and on par with fast food quality which is OK for 8 bucks, but not for 18.00.

I won't return until I've heard there is a change of management."}
{"text":"All Aboard!! Jump on the bandwagon and pony up to the bar on the National Express. This train of draft and debauchery is departing 7 days a week - and is always a good time! 

From raucous good convos with complete strangers you meet at the German style beerhall tables, to the glorious patio, this place has got it all. So take a gander at the flickering list of brews on the numerous boards, order some tasty treats like the tater-tots, duck nuggets or beer cheese spread & pretzel bread, and prepare to have a grand 'ol time! 

I can't wait to pop in for a Buck-A-Shuck night next time (I believe that's on Tuesday)."}
{"text":"came here 2x with the bf for drinks - he LOVES this place b/c the atmosphere is pumping...always super busy! we came once in the summer and it looked like a huge party! so many people outside on the patio it was great!
the 2nd time we sat at the bar, again super packed but too cold to sit outside. i loved the beer signs that look like train stations (see pic) along the bar - super cool! he ordered oysters and we were quite close to the area where they prepare the oysters - ladies there is a mighty fineee looking gentleman that works at the oyster stations good too look at while waiting lol
my bf said the oysters were fresh and tastey! will def come back for drinks, can't wait for summer patio season too!"}
{"text":"The National beer hall brand has expanded significantly in the last couple of years in the city serving good quality food and drinks. This is my go to place for $1 oysters, however, recently the quality of the oysters and the shucking haven't been the greatest. But when you are paying $1 I don't really expect them to offer the world to me. Still, they offer east and west with all the accoutrements with a LARGE selection of beers, ciders, IPA etc.

Definitely a good place to hit up with friends and people watch on 17th"}
{"text":"Went to National with a girlfriend last night after our hot yoga session. The place was very busy for a Tuesday night. The server was prompt and took our drink orders right away. I was very impressed with my Cesar that was garnished with a cheddar cheese cube, a shrimp, a slice of pickle, AND a celery stalk. The drink was a bit strong (may have been the IPA they add in), but how can you complain when you have that much garnish. 

My friend and I shared oysters (Min. order of 6 at $3/oyster), shrimp (Min. order of 6 at $2/shrimp), and the mussels & frites. All of the food was exceptional, and we were pleasantly surprised with the extra oysters and shrimp that the kitchen had thrown in. The pricing of the menu is a bit more expensive than some other pubs, but overall when it comes to good seafood that is around the price you pay in Calgary. 

I will definitely be back to try some of the fantastic beers they have on tap, as well as some other items on the menu. I feel as though this could become a new favorite amongst me and my friends."}
{"text":"Gave them another shot, and the overall experience was really dissatisfying. May as well as not come back!"}
{"text":"I did lots and lots of research on where I should go while visiting Calgary. National did not come up on any of those lists. I passed by National while walking around 17th, and thought it was as great space. I decided to give it a try. I walked in and was blown away by the German Style, open table/space concept. They had TONS of beers on tap with some tv screens displaying what beers they had and where they were from. 

I sat at the bar, and the breakfast poutine was highly recommended by someone sitting next to me. Glad I ordered it! It had great vegetables, tater tots, cheese curds and some really good gravy, all topped with a fried egg. it was very very good! The only thing that it was lacking (and this is just a personal preference of mine) was some spicy. Luckily, they had tons of hot sauces to choose from!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place to eat and drink. Had the chicken burger which was really good. Service was ok. Wasn't a big fan of the cafeteria style seating but we had our own table which was nice. Overall a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Had a bite to eat, with the Bootcamp Breakfast Club Team, on the patio this afternoon, after the X-Warrior competition at the Saddledome. Courteous staff, wide selection of beer, great selection of food and outstanding service during a very busy time of day. Our meals were all delivered at the same time. Salads were fresh, meats were well done, the fries and potato fritters were delicious. The only critique were the Clive burgers. The patties were dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"Too expensive!  And closed on Mondays!

My waitress actually screwed up my beer order.  My friend got my beer and I got his.  And she would not replace my good scotch beer.  Although she would give me a sampler of the original beer I had ordered, she would not replace my beer!

This bar is brighter than the ship, but the food is about 40% higher at the National than at the Ship and higher than Sal's across the street (however, if Sal's is charging cover, the food  probably costs the same.)

I'm not likely to go back, except to buy just that Scotch beer on the menu for $9.   But that's probably it."}
{"text":"Ehh.

I can see why this place has a low rating.  The servers seemed depressed and so did the food.  The mixed drinks were awful.  We had the Oysters and were asked if we wanted west coast or east coast. Not too descriptive, but went with it.  We ordered West Coast and they did not taste like any west coast oysters I have ever had.  Won't be a next time for this place. So many places to try!!!"}
{"text":"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.

I went to the new National pub with some ex-coworkers for lunch. It's right beside the Ship & Anchor, which I thought was a pretty bold move. But as another reviewer pointed out, the Ship is always full so might as well be there to capitalize on those extra people and carve out a name for yourself.

The best of times:
- The space is just beautiful. It's got floor to ceiling windows and wraps around the corner onto 5 St. Tons of light. There is a nice large outdoor wrap around patio, with south and west exposure. There is a long wraparound bar on the inside, as well as big communal seating in the middle. It sort of reminds me of Wurst, except upstairs and with natural light. It's very inviting. The decor is kind of farmhouse-chic, it reminds me of the restaurant Farm. There is a large oyster bar which caught my eye.

- The beer menu is extensive and delicious, with a large number of rotating seasonal beers. 

- I had the Pulled Maple Hill Chicken sandwich with a side-order of fries. It was very tasty, on fresh ciabatta. Good flavour. The menu didn't look overwhelming and had a number of appealing options.

The worst of times:
- The service was *really* bad. I will grant that there were about 10 of us, so I guess it can be hard to coordinate that logistically. My beer didn't come out for a good 20 mins. Lunch didn't come out for close to an hour.

- The waitress messed up our bills, putting some of my items on another person's bill. This is despite the numbers carved into the table, so the wait staff knows who ordered what.

- Very expensive. My pulled chicken sandwich was $14, and only comes with the sandwich. To get fries with the sandwich, I had to pay $3 for a tiny side of fries in a cup. $17 is just too much for that. The beer was expensive too, 8.5 for an imperial pint. These are in unfortunate contrast to the Ship, where both the food and the beer are reasonably priced and delicious.

I'm hoping National can iron out some of these kinks because I really liked the space. I'm definitely going to give it another shot."}
{"text":"I thought I would update my review, as this particular National - on 17th avenue has now continually disappointed in regards to service, quality, and staff.

We love the National chains throughout Calgary, and go to all of them frequently for their great weekly deals, $5 happy hour, and great menu.   This location seriously has some issues with staff and quality control it seems, as the past 3 visits have all been terrible.

Our most recent trip, our server knew absolutely nothing about the beer selections - how do you hire someone at a beer market who has no knowledge of beer!?   Whatever, we made our choices and then our friends ordered food and appetizers.  The appys came out promptly.   We then waited almost an hour for the entree.  Clearly there was some disconnect between the server and the kitchen, or the server forgot to enter the entrees.  Something went wrong either way.  We got a quick apology and the server did remove the entree from the bill.  However, when it did arrive there were multiple hairs in the food!!!!   

Our 3 hour visit to this National, the server barely asked us how we were, was extremely abrupt, and we basically had to flag her down to get a new beer.  Frequently she'd miss 1 of us at the table and then walk away leaving that person without a beer until she decided to show up again.   

I decided I wanted to order a dessert, and asked for the fiasco gelato cookie dish.  The menu doesn't really explain what it is, but my impression it was gelato with cookies, or some kind of ice cream sandwich.  A few minutes later a guy walks over and plops a big bowl of ice cream down without saying ANYTHING.   Definitely didn't match the description on the menu and no one even bothered to communicate with us.  Had our server said they were out of cookies I'd have definitely not ordered it, but was now expected to eat this makeshift dessert...

I will definitely be going back to other National locations, but am now avoiding this one, as there is a clear disconnect between customer, server, and quality that patrons have come to expect from the National brand."}
