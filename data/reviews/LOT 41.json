{"text":"Good food, slow service.  I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality of food here since most hotel restaurants are typically sub par.  The menu offer a wide variety of dishes and the food is delicious.  There are plenty of seating in this restaurant - bar, lounge, or table.  You can pick your own table but the arrival time of a waiter/waitress is up to chance.  Char Siu $22 - I enjoyed this pork belly and duck confit dish. It comes with mashed potatoes and maple butter glaze which produced a nice sweet and savory combination.  It also comes with pita and hummus, which makes a nice appetizer.  Artisan Beet Salad $15 - Delicious salad and not dominated by beets.  The yogurt dressing is very good and not overly sweet.  Diamond Lil's Star cocktail $12 - This coconut rum + lychee liqueur + lychee juice + lemon juice is delicious and not too sweet nor strong.  Restaurant is located inside the Delta Marriott airport hotel.  ....| \      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,       .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _     ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

{"text":"Probably the best offering at the hotel.  Very nice space , good place to gather after  meetings and they keep it from feeling like a hotel restaurant.   Food seemed to be prepared with pride and staff was attentive.   Try the hummus."}
{"text":"The only thing that had any taste to it was the beer. Overpriced to eat boiled tasteless food. Not impressive when you're hangry."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Super slow and forgetful staff. Rude management. Extremely overpriced drinks ($7.5 for a shot of Baileys. According to management \"liquor is harder to make\" so they HAVE to charge more) and the food was not only expensive but very poor. Overall bad experience."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food came out very fast. Decor is comfortable and modern. I ordered the Thai shrimp. It came with some of the best homemade hummus. It did not have cauliflower which I was excited about but the asparagus and broccoli was cooked perfectly and everything was well seasoned. Will definitely continue to eat there during my stays in Toronto."}
