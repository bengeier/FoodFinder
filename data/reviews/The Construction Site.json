{"text":"One word: SALT  Yes, it's a neat concept: grilled cheese sandwich shop. Yes, they claim to have excellent aged cheddar cheese. And yes, excellent location.  But no thank you, I won't be paying anybody 6 bucks for a grilled cheese sandwich. They're not THAT good. But what really turned me off was their special soup of the day: Lobster Bisque. It sounded very enticing but boy did I ever regret getting the soup. The Lobster Bisque was a fishy smelling soup consisting of cream, some sort of sea food and SALT. There was so much salt in this soup, it would crystallize if served cold.   I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, especially children and the elderly and anyone with blood pressure issues.   P.S. did I mention SALT?"}
{"text":"I love love love cheese and thought this place was just ok. The grilled cheese and (rosemary?) chips were pretty good, but not so good that it was worth all the salt and fat. And as other reviewers have mentioned, really pricey. And it was incredibly slow. I stopped here on my way to an appointment on a Saturday and only two people were ahead of me but I still ended up waiting 10 mins. For a grilled cheese."}
{"text":"As my profile states - \"will run for grilled cheese sandwiches\", I definitely couldn't pass up the chance to try this place out as I walked by it today.   Love the fact that there's a resto in my area dedicated to grilled cheese sandwiches. For that concept alone, it's automatically starts at 3 stars in my books.   For my first foray into The Construction Site (and there will be more forays in the future, believe you me), I decided on The Classic (Aged Cheddar between two slices of French white bread). After all, how can you truly judge a grilled cheese sandwich if not in its purest, nakedest form... melted cheese and buttered bread.   Long and short, it was deliciously tasty... this is where the 4th star makes its appearance. The cheese was perfectly and evenly melted all over. The buttered slices of bread toasted crisply giving a satisfying crunch with every bite (though, I was left wishing the bread was a tad thicker in slicing... I love me some crisp crunch with the soft underbelly of bread fluff).   The accompanying chips were good. Not spectacular. Rosemary-flavoured rippled chips, more or less, but literally chips (think thick cut Ruffles potato chips, not the British sense of fish and chips). A tad on the frequently-wiping-fingers-on-the-napkin side of oily but you could see the pieces of rosemary mingling amongst the chips classing it up a bit.  Would've been nice to see a salad substitute option without having to pay an additional $5 for a caprese salad. Sometimes it's just a side salad kind of day.  Oh, and an additional note for hot sauce lovers... it looked like they had green and red tabasco sauce on hand... which is weak sauce (yes - pun intended) when it comes to hot sauces but does the job in a pinch when a little more heat is desired for dipping grilled cheeses.  All in all, a delicious lunch of my favourite sandwich of all time. I will be returning to try out some of the other options on the menu but sometimes, all a girl wants is a decent grilled cheese and somebody else to make it for her. The Construction Site fulfills that need."}
{"text":"ALERT - Yonge/Eglinton location CLOSED in September.  They have another location at Sherway Gardens.  Very tasty macaroni & cheese filled grilled cheese if you get the chance to try it."}
{"text":"I love coming here on my lunch brake. The staff is always friendly and the food Delicious. They recently added 5-cheese Maccaroni & Cheese to their menu. I wasn't a fan of the new item however."}
{"text":"This place has the most imaginative menu.  They actually let customers design there own item from scratch to host as the featured sandwich which keeps the menu always fresh.  The ingredients are first class and the interior is always clean and well organized.  They take there sandwich making seriously and obviously have a passion for it."}
{"text":"Went there for a grilled cheese sandwich and was astonished at the prices... I mean, it's grilled cheese with chips as a side.  Don't get me wrong, the food was pretty decent but when I compared to another grilled cheese place that I 've been to, it's overpriced."}
{"text":"There's just something that doesn't make sense to me about having to pay $10+ for cheese and two pieces of toast.  What can go wrong with a grilled cheese sandwich? Nothing! The side salad didn't make me feel better about how much I spent either, especially because it was soggy.   What can I say about the service?  * Very Slow  * Unhelpful Server, and did I mention unfriendly as well?   My experience could have been botched by the fact it was a lunch-rush period, but even if the service was better, I think I'd rather grille my own sandwiches at home."}
{"text":"Today I found myself saying \"to hell with my diet\" (after only 6 days). But then again with a gourmet grilled cheese shop steps from where I was working, wouldn't you say the same thing? Yes, yes you would.... And you in the back who said you wouldn't, two things a) shut your judgmental hole and stop pretending you don't like yourself a grilled cheese, b) Have you not seen their menu? smarten up junior this is grilled cheese  Smack down now laid!   This used to be a shopsys or something and while it still has a similar layout this is not the same old boring sandwich shop, this is slabs of colon clogging comforting cheesey cuisine. CHEESE dammit. CHEESE!  I'm actually shocked that with how busy Yonge and Eglington is by day, that this spot isn't topping out on reviews. It's a convenient location and very cool when you walk in.   Today I ordered one of the specials: Miss Piggy. Which if this was a woman I would bed her and make her my wife MEOW! Seriously not even Kermit could turn down this saucy swine!   I mean pulled pork on a panini Bianca, grilled with 3 types of cheese (cheddar, Brie AND Swiss) SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!! SERIOUSLY!! And what's more to add coronary to the end of this foodgasm, TCS makes their own ruffle potatoe chips in house and fills this sandwich with a layer. Just because they can. EF-you mere mortal, less awesome sandwiches.   Now before I get too much more excited I should add that you can have your sandwich, err excuse me, you can your sex with either chips or salad. I decided on pairing my cheese sex with salad (a boys gotta keep to his diet a little). Points for using mixed greens and not just iceberg or romaine.   The cherry on top was their speciality dipping sauce, is it ketchup? Is it Thai dressing? BBQ sauce? Who cares its friggin delicious!   I paired that with a Boylan Ginger Ale. Delicious!   Spots for Needs improvement? Umm maybe ask to have the pulled pork warmed up a bit before added to the sandwich and guys I know it's gourmet but $14 and change for grilled cheese and a sodie pap? Come on..... Cam..... Caaaaammmm ( russel peters reference)!  I'm happy, in full, Miss Piggy and I have decided to go public with our beastiality relationship. Until next time,......  Keep calm and Cheese on!"}
{"text":"The service was good and friendly, but when I was there it was rather busy and there was only one girl trying to take orders and prepare food as well. So, as a result, the sandwich that I ordered took quite a while to get. Obviously I don't blame the single employee that was working as fast as she could but the establishment needs more people working. I'm assuming they thought it would be a slow time when I was there but that's when things get busy, when you least expect it. As for the food.... It was good and fresh and well made. I can't really go on a tangent about how amazing it was because I just wasn't blown away by it, but there was definitely nothing wrong with it. Perhaps I expected more for the amount they charge for sandwiches. All in all it was a descent experience and good food. I would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Caution: Carb Overload Ahead!  I would not have found out about this place had it not been for a 5 AM opening shift I agreed to take at the Starbucks nearby. Thank goodness that I did though :)  There was no way was I passing on the Funghi Swiss, which came with truffled oyster mushrooms. As an added bonus, I redeemed the Foursquare special, which gave me a double decked upsize (and proved to be more than I can handle)! There was nothing too overpowering with the grilled cheese, which is how I like it. It was an even spread of oyster mushrooms, with the subtlety of the truffle oil, packed between the chewy goodness of the Swiss cheese. The accompanying chutney dip and rosemary chips (resembling Ruffles) added a nice touch as well.  For about $10, I'd say the price is fair. I like their idea of the \"feature\" which allows customers to a create a new item on the menu, with the best item replacing the lowest selling item next month. With that said, the menu could use a couple more staple items or offer a create-your-own option.  I'd definitely come back though. I'd love to try the S'more!"}
{"text":"Very Friendly Service, I enjoyed the mac n cheese grilled cheese, but it was not as filling as I was expecting, which is probably a good thing.  The potato chips are fantastic!  I really enjoy this place and will be back to try some other menu items.  And they have awesome soda"}
{"text":"I had the Fungi and the S'more sandwiches. Both sandwiches were delicious. The service was friendly. I highly recommend you try a grilled cheese at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Too pricey, not that tasty. $13 for a mediocre grille cheese sandwich, ok chips and a tiny bottle of coke.  I may possibly go back but not any time soon."}
{"text":"Excellent location right at Yonge and Eglinton. I love the idea of a place that does one thing, but does it really really well. Unfortunately The Contruction Site isn't one of those places. The restaurant feels a bit too 'fast food chain' and doesn't feel like that much effort went into it. I wouldn't mind that if the sandwiches didn't start at about 6 dollars for a grilled cheese sandwich without taxes which IMO is waaayyyyy too steep for what is basically two slices of bread with cheese in the middle that is heated up. I ordered mine with tomatoes (a dollar extra)  in it which was a big mistake. The tomatoes took a longer time to cool down than the cheese in the sandwich and some bits of it were disintegrating (probably from being pressed while being grilled) I would expect them to use better quality cheese for the price and was a bit dissapointed with how it tasted. All sandwiches are served with chips or a salad. The chips are apparently 'home made' but they didn't taste too different from something that came out of a box. This brings me to my final complaint - the box that it is served in (even if you're not getting take out) had a slight wierd carboard like smell to it. Now coming to the good part - the service is great and the staff was very patient with me. They also have free wifi and offers if you check in on foursquare. There you have it - my compliment sandwich for The Contruction Site."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I was excited to try the breakfast grilled cheese. (How could you go wrong?) I ordered it with tomato and without bacon. It was delicious, and it came with rosemary chips that were also pretty great. The star, however, was the nibbler. The idea: gotta make room for egg in a breakfast grilled cheese, so they carve a hole out of it and crack the egg into that; but they keep the carved out bit and grill it on its own into a flat and crispy, cheesy bonus. So, so good!  On my last visit, I planned to try the Cha Cha Cha--because I love avocado and havarti--but, when I saw the special, I couldn't resist. Prime rib, caramelized onions, aged cheddar, horseradish? I had to try it before it was gone, just in case it wouldn't be back for a while. Just awesome! Cha Cha Cha next time...I promise.  I wasn't adventurous enough to try the haggis special (it was a one-day only opportunity for Robbie Burns Day)! I'll try to come back on holidays that have food within my (picky) comfort zone... ;)  Overall, it's a cool idea and there's nothing like it around here. The menu keeps changing, which is nice because it responds to what customers are liking. Plus you can tweet music requests at them."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this new grilled cheese place right by yonge n eglinton I had the funghi, which is $9.00 for the sandwich and is served with a side of their rosemary chips (all sandwiches except the S'more are served with their chips) This sandwich was really nice; cheese was perfectly melted, the crusted parmesan added SO much flavour (a nice salty, garlicy parmesan taste)... I didn't need any sauce or dip.. it had a lot of flavoured and was drizzled with balsamic My boyfriend had the reuben, which was also really tasty.. they give a mustard to dip it in and it goes really well...  I love the different breads and cheese and we both enjoyed our sandwiches quite a bit The only thing is that it is a bit pricey... i mean $9.00 for just a grilled cheese?  *Not sure if their site has any prices but they range from $5.50 from a single \"classic: aged chedder\" to $9.50 for the Maple Walnut* I do know they will be regularly changing their menu so prices might change They also offer 2 soup options...1 daily special and 1 that is their take on tomato soup They have a caprese salad as well for $5 I'll definitely come back in a few weeks and see what new sandwiches they have"}
{"text":"Hello Comfort food!   This place is going to be totally bad for my health! :P   Apparently this place has been around for 3 weeks but I only noticed it now.  I tried the Classic today which was sooooo good.  They make these sandwiches to perfection.   All sandwiches come with some chips on the side and without a drink mine came to roughly $6.  The other adventurous sandwiches are roughly $10. I HAVE to go back and try this Smores one ... It just sounds divine!  They have limited seating which kinda sucks because then you are stuck taking it to go and with winter around the corner, you can't sit out in the sun.   At the end of the I think $6 for a grilled cheese is a bit much because it's around $3 to actually make?  But you can't argue that this is a great sandwich with friendly chatter from the staff and fresh (and sometimes healthy) ingredients going into your creation.  Give it a try -  You can't say no to comfort food :D"}
{"text":"Absolutely brilliant.  The headquarters for the company I work for is in the building, however the parent company is based in San Francisco. Down the street from our office there is the American Grilled Cheese kitchen, which I thought for some time was the pinnacle of Grilled cheese perfection.  Turns out I was wrong. It's right here in Toronto.  I came by at about 2pm, after the long lines, and am happy that I did. Things seemed to have calmed down, and while there was some confusion about what I was ordering (really need to teach their team what chutney is and how it's made!), I had an all day breakfast with bacon that simply blew my mind.  The sandwich itself had just the right amount of oil/butter. I think people not used to *true* panini grilled sandwiches might find it \"greasy\", but they're comparing it to their home grilled cheese, not the awesomeness coming out of a grill.  The cheese was excellent. Sharp, aged cheddar is key, and it hit the mark, perfectly. The bacon had some great flavour to it. While I'd even suggest slightly stronger flavouring to offset the sharp cheese, that's more a personal preference thing than anything else. Really? It was excellent as-is.  But I think what amazed me the most was how well they captured that west-coast San-Francisco vibe in the restaurant itself. I think honestly that it will take a bit of getting used to for Torontonians - but as someone who visits both coasts regularly, I have to say without question that their product, presentation, and modern appeal are *exactly* what interest me in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I stopped at The Construction Site en route to a meeting in the burbs for one one of their epic grilled cheese sandwiches I've been hearing so much about, and I was not disappointed. Is this place good? You better brie-leave it. Shucks, that pun was no gouda.   I went for The Sheeva. This is macaroni and cheese inside of a grilled cheese. What? You read that right. It was a-ok, perhaps a bit bland for me. I would have enjoyed some sharper flavours in the cheese sauce inside the sandwich, but I perked it up with some hot sauce. My friends both had the Ruben grilled cheese, and I think they won the ordering round this time. Really nice meat served with some seriously banging Dijon.   They've done a great job of making this place comfortable with the indoor picnic tables, while staying true to their name. I'll definitely be back when I'm next at Yonge and Eg, and I think I'll go for their spiciest sandwich.   PEPPER POINTS: For even putting cheese in their side salads. A true cheese-athon of a meal."}
