{"text":"Had my first dinner at Fortune recently. Great flavor spin on tacos (had haddock, chicken and pork), Kale salad was delicious, and the grits, ah yes, much better than grits I've had in South Carolina and Tenn. Great food for great prices. I just moved from Mexico to Montreal so I know Tacos. Fortune's Tacos are a unique spin a el Norte. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As a USian transplant to Montreal, I often find that my palate craves a bit of Tex-Mex, Fonda, or indeed any variety of south-of-the-even-souther-border flavor. Montreal's stable of restos that dependably serve up bold Latino flavor is growing, but it's still not that long. Fortune, which might be most accurately called a taco bar, fills a major gap in our fair city's food pantheon.  Flat out, Fortune's offerings boast some of the very highest dollar-for-flavor ratios in the whole city (Au Pied de cochon and Toqué! notwithstanding). If it's generally true that great flavor may be delicate, but not timid, it's particularly true of the basic Tex-Mex flavor profile. Lime, cilantro, and chili require a supremely self-confident hand to harmonize their strengths. The chefs at Fortune have this confidence in spades--as well as the talent to wear it well. Seriously, Fortune's tacos actually achieve that highly-coveted and almost-mythical state of so-delicious-it's-hard-to-slow-down-long-enough-to-really-taste-it. They offer pork, chicken, fish, shrimp, cauliflower, and hominy tacos, and they're _all_ top notch. If unicorns existed, unicorn steak tacos would taste only _marginally_ better than these.  Speaking of unicorns, perhaps my fanciful analogy explains the huge red-neon horseshoe that hangs over the dining tables at Fortune. Then again, perhaps not. (Unicorns have cloven hoofs, don't they?) The horseshoe is the resto's logo, and yes, of course I get that horseshoes hung on the wall bring good \"fortune.\" I see the connection, just not the obvious leap to a slightly lurid glowing red horseshoe, though I'm willing to be persuaded that it symbolizes both Fortune's torrid love affair with big flavor and the good fortune that we the eaters of Montreal enjoy as a result.  In addition to the city's most flavorful tacos, Fortune also serves excellent salads, all of which make fine sideshows to the main event. The menu even manages to remind you, rather waggishly, that you're still in Quebec by including a section of guédilles--hotdog buns stuffed with with anything but hotdog. I haven't tasted any of these yet, but they read, smell, and look pretty damn appetizing. Even with all this, though, the food menu is a mere half-page--a model of focus and clarity.  As for libations, Fortune also offers cocktails, a few of which are originals. Their interpretations of classics--like the Margarita--are entirely competent. (That's actually saying a lot, given the swill that most Montreal bars serve under that name.) Fortune's original cocktails, while not quite as scrumptious as their tacos, are just as ambitious flavor-wise. My wife and I have tried a few, and they've been not only well-balanced and loaded with flavor, but--and this is the sign a superior potion--pleasing from first sip to last.  Fortune's storefront is a little hard to find (on the west side of St-Laurent just north of Beaubien), as their sign and overall decor are understated almost to the level of being spartan. The ambiance is therefore a bit idiosyncratic. The energy of the two-lady crew that staffs the place has been, when I've been there, thoroughly professional and polished. The furniture and table settings, however, are bare bones, while the art on the walls (think large photos/renderings of arrays of gorgeous wigs and a glowing red horseshoe) is... quixotic. I actually like the ambiance, but it's challenging to imagine how it might come across to someone else. I suppose the only thing for it is for you head over there, scarf one or two of Montreal's tastiest tacos, sip a pleasingly piquant cocktail, and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, my boyfriend ordered both chicken and cauliflower tacos and said the veggie one was even better than the meat one! Ice cream sandwich to die for."}
{"text":"Totally delicious.  We loved the complex flavours and the fresh healthy ingredients.  Great service and cosy atmosphere.  We will be back soon.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice and the tacos are actually quite good, however kinda overpriced (4.50 minimum for a single taco...) and the service is slow.  We also had a pork guedille, which is a much smaller version of a Bahn Mi for double the price. If you're into Mexican and in Little Italy however this is a decent option. However, I ordered for home delivery through foodora and I live literally a block from the restaurant. When I received my order (after a long wait) everything was cold and all the tacos we're on top of each other. This cause all the fillings to all blend together, making a gigantic single messy taco. I expect that if a restaurant in this price range decides to deliver food, it should try to package it in a way that it remains warm and that each piece remains intact. This really gave my friend and I a negative image of this restaurant. Definitely a fail"}
{"text":"Great first impression of this small but welcoming taco joint. Had three tacos (pork special, chicken, and fish) all were quite tasty, and a shrimp and grits appetizer that was tasty and cheesy with just the right amount of spice and crunch from the chicherons. Good selection of local and imported beers and the key lime pie was a nice finishing touch. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sampled a few of their tacos, guédilles, drinks and desserts. All-in-all, quite good! The tacos average about $5 each but come with two shells and a decent amount of toppings, so we were able to split each order into two easily without them being too skimpy. I actually preferred the guédille (tried the pork one) to the tacos but both were quite good. We had a seasonal pumpkin taco which had no dairy and frankly didn't really need it. It was pretty flavourful and had a pumpkin seed salsa which seemed pretty original.  The desserts were good, but out of the three (we sampled a bunch between all of us) one really stood out which was the ice cream sandwich.   Cocktails were quite nice as was the atmosphere. It is pretty small in there so if you're looking for some intimacy, maybe not the place to go. We were seated at the bar and had a plethora of take-away customers standing beside and behind us. Service was a weeeee bit slow but the food made up for it. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Un très petit resto qui propose une courte mais délicieuse liste de tacos et quelques autres spécialités texanes ou mexicaines. Les tacos sont de petites tailles, il vous en faudra donc environ 3 pour vous rassasier mais ils sont très bien garnis. A essayer absolument: crevettes & grits. Assez différent, c'est un petit plat rempli de saveurs. Le tout accompagné d'une bonne Michelada! Le Resto n'a pas de climatisation et manque d'aération, préparez-vous a avoir chaud et sentir la bouffe, peut-être un meilleur choix en saison plus fraîche. Service courtois, un peu lent selon l'achalandage, mais on prend le temps de donner de bons conseils."}
{"text":"I really like their food - the tacos are great and hit the spot. BUT... the service was often cold, at the beginning the food was good so I'd come back, I wanted to love this place as I live close-by. I brought a few friends here on different occasions, and each time we remarked at how weird the service was and I'd feel bad for taking them there -  i.e. getting asked if we want the bill every 5 minutes even if we're not done eating, walking in and being asked right away if we're there for take-out, blank stares as we approach the counter even if I'm greeting them with a smile (and I've seen them several times - I started going once or twice a week by myself after work for a bite and a book - they know who I am!).  The one male server is nice, but the rest... they look like they hate you for being in their restaurant. My partner started to refuse to go there because of the behaviour. I've given up on it, which is a shame since it would be great to eat their food again!"}
{"text":"my wife loved this place so much that she wanted to write the review:  \"Great food and nice atmosphere! The tacos were phenomenal! We tried the chicken, shrimp fish and cauliflower, all with their own unique flavour palettes. So delicious and easily shareable.  Also tried the \"shrimp and grits\" which was truly delectable! Two write corn grit patties with amazing cheesiness with shrimp and coriander.... very good!  Only down side was that they did not have their own home made hot sauce, but no matter!\""}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood. Warm, friendly athmosphere, amazing service and the food is awesome. There are many hot sauces to choose from, which I always love. Try the shrimp and grits."}
{"text":"This place is cute and small. The staff are exceedingly friendly and accommodating. The menu is really interesting and their specials are pretty inventive!  That said, the tacos we ordered were fine but nothing extraordinary. For drinks, my date got the Kentucky Maid and I got the Hibiscus Buck.  His was refreshing and tasty. Mine was WAY too sour- it totally overshadowed the rest of the flavours meant to be in there.    We ordered the brownie and lime tart for dessert. The lime tart was super nice. If you go, definitely order it. But DO NOT order the brownie. We were really sceptical when we read that it came with a chipotle sauce but were willing to trust in the chef's choice of mixing these two flavours together. This was a mistake. It is not good. Thankfully our awesome waitress was on the ball, sensed the issue and took care of it!  There are a lot of taco places in Mtl. If you're around it's worth checking out but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here again."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you are allergic to seafood! The waiter told me they use a lot of fish in their sauces  and even the non-fish options are NOT SAFE!"}
{"text":"Favourite place in rosemont petit patrie for quick, affordable food. It's vegetarian friendly which is great and the food is always consistently good. Have the shrimp and grits as they are always amazing. Have a margarita they are sweet, salty and addictive."}
{"text":"Très bon petit restaurant, tout y est bon, frais et bien assaisonné.  Mention spéciale pour les guédilles et la tarte au citron.  Le rapport qualité/prix est vraiment très bien. J'y retourne régulièrement avec plaisir."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch all the time  The tacos are amazing, so fresh and flavourful. It's also very affordable. The service is slightly lacking in my opinion but still not bad at all. I would recommend the fish tacos and porc tacos."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here! I sat at the bar with the funny cool women making the food and serving it up. I had two tacos, one spicy cauliflower vegetarian and one chicken roasted beer. Both had this awesome homemade pickled cabbage on top, both were double homemade fresh tortillas piled high. $9 for the two and it made a filling lunch. There are a couple cool cocktails and beers here and it's a tiny well lit room that seems like it would be fun to hang out in the evening. And they have square now so credit is kosher."}
{"text":"Vraiment chouette comme \" fast food \".  Produits au menu de qualité et personnel relax et cool.  Délicieux la guédille aux crevettes épicées et le grit.  Trendy et le fun!  Plusieurs cocktails créatifs au menu également. Belle soirée entre amis! Prix raisonnables."}
{"text":"I really liked it.  Everything was flavorful, fresh, and thoughtful.  We had a variant of shrimp taco that was their daily special.  The tortilla was very corny, as it should have been.  We also had 2 quedilles, 1 crab, and one shrimp.  The buns were soft, light, buttery, and toasted nicely, and the fillings each had a lot of flavor.  The peas in the crab quedille were a nice and very welcomed touch.  We also had the shrimp n grits.  It was excellent - buttery, shrimpy, a little spicy, and just grity enough without being too grity.  The lime tart was extremely good.  It was a very pleasant experience, and we would definitely come again - and will!."}
{"text":"Si vous êtes à la recherche de bons tacos dans le quartier, c'est ici qu'il faut venir. Avec un menu du jour , on y retrouve son compte. Un peu dispendieux pour la quantité mais c'est l'endroit idéal afin de commander plusieurs sortes et splitter le bill entre amis."}
{"text":"Came in during my long walk up Saint Laurent this weekend to warm up and have a light lunch. I had two tacos, one spicy cauliflower vegetarian and one fish taco. 9$ all in, and I left feeling fulfilled; I think to get full from here though, you'd need to drop quite a few dollars to make it happen. I really liked sitting at the bar and chatting with the ladies running the place, but there's a nice table if you come in with a group and the drink list had some nice Mexican beers and cocktails on it too."}
