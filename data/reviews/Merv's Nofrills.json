{"text":"Love Merv's because it's a rare combination of really low prices, a clean store (newly constructed) and helpful staff. We were there during dollar days and they had extra staff on to deal with the rush, from restocking to checkout. If only all stores had the foresight to do this!In fact you will see Merv himself roaming to store too. Not as large as No Frills stores back in Ontario, but better than local competitors and had most everything we shop for."}
{"text":"Nofrills on 17th Ave the staff is not friendly at all . I dont think the Hiring Manager understands in Diversity Hiring. 70% of customers are non white and yet their Staff is all White, and if this does not change we should boycott going to this store!!!!"}
{"text":"No frill is great.  It is like a mini-Superstore.  Obviously the selection of products is not as great as a Superstore but you get similar value on most products as the bigger Superstore.  Things that are on their weekly flyer are often priced better than their Superstore brother."}
