{"text":"the food is Ok, but service is terrible.  We have four  people and would like to sit together. When we arrived there is one table for four where the guests there is about to finish. This stupid waiter asked for our number and promised he  would call us when the table is available.  15 mins there's no call and we went back only to found a new group of guests out of nowhere have taken the table.  To be honestly we are totally understanding if the waiter simply forgot to call us. But   when we ask him why some new ones have gotten the table when it was available and he never called us. here's his response, \"I said I'll call you when it's available, it's not available now.\"  Well, I guess if you are  reading this review, you know now why the 1star."}
{"text":"Shabu shabu was a great experience, it was very fun and delicious. My daughter and son and I tried the seafood, ribeye and chicken shabu shabu. The vegetables were fresh and crisp. The meet and seafood were similarly fresh.   The waiter was knowledgeable and friendly but not obstructive.   In all we rate it 5 out of 5 Star Wars !"}
{"text":"Soooo cheap and delicious. I pick the spicy broth with vegetables and that leaves me very satisfied. It also comes with a dessert."}
{"text":"Un restaurant de fondue japonaise en plein coeur du quartier chinois. L'endroit n'est pas visible de l'extérieur mais l'intérieur est à la fois conviviale et esthétique. De charmantes serveuses vous apportent assiettes de viandes et légumes avec votre bouillon personnel qui reste toujours chaud!  L'essayer c'est l'adopter :)"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh & clean. You'll order a soup(broth) & a plate of meat.  Don't forget to use dipping sauce in the small cup in front of you. It elevates the flavour. Don't expect Chinese, Mongolian fondue either. Japanese version is different."}
{"text":"Excellent Shabu Shabu of a quality you normally only find in Japan. Highly recommended! The staff is very helpful and explains everything so that even people who never had Shabu Shabu before will enjoy every minute in this unique restaurant."}
{"text":"Where I come from, while having a shabu shabu you might as well drop your wallet into the pot so expensive is the experience.  Hanashima hits the spot on all fronts.   Firstly, it is a very informal setting and elegantly minimalistic. High stools, a long counter and an individual burner for each guest are really all it takes for shabu shabu, no bells and whistles added.  Secondly, it is incredibly well-priced and they make a perceptible effort to keep their prices down. In the two and more years I've been a patron, the prices haven't changed by a digit.  Recession bit them too, so today instead of ice cream PLUS iced coffee for dessert, you get one or the other. Additionally, if before prices included tax, today the tax is extra. It is still a bargain.  Thirdly, the service is efficient, polite, cheerful and fast. I would go to Hanashima just to have the waitress smile at me.  Fourthly, the menu is simple but the meal is filling and involves a variety of courses. The extra sides you can order make the customisations almost endless.  Even ethnic food sceptics appreciate the straightforwardness of Hanashima's approach and the sheer quality of their food. I've seen it happen first-hand.  Other reviewers mentioned another website that lists Hanashima (restomontreal). After reading the reviews on Yelp, heading over there for the vouchers can actually offset the sales taxes (10%). (I hope this doesn't breach Yelp's terms).  Hanashima is a spot to keep in your books due to its perfection and its location. In the heart of Chinatown, it is close to great Chinese bakeries where you can get an extra dessert and bubble tea.  I also recommend Hanashima for a cheap and no-strings-attached date, or for post-important-introductions dinners. The counter seating doesn't require guests to stare at each other for the meal's duration, the crowd, decor and food provide great converation starters and the gentle broth's bubbling fills in the necessary moments of silence.  A relaxed meal in an unusual setting without the pressure of it being too unusual. Vegetarians are catered for with the huge veggie combo, meat-eaters are spoilt for choice, seafood lovers will delight in the seafood combo and everyone will have a great time at an excellent price.  Get the regular portions, splurge because here you can!  Reserve whenever you go: I saw it fill up pretty fast on both weekday (sometimes) and weekend nights (always)."}

{"text":"This is more of a 3-4 stars place...but I will give them the bump up to 4. I had the vegetable plate and added some shrimp. The presentation of the food was great, the spicy broth was not too spicy, but had some flavor. I wish they gave us a little more instruction on the cooking order of the food, but we figured it out. The quality of the vegetables and the shrimp was great. I saw other plates with beef and pork and they all looked like good sized portions. I would go back again when in Montreal."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a couple of years now, and I am happy that we did.  This is only my second Shabu Shabu experience, so I do not claim to be any sort of expert.  You can order either a small or a large here.  I recommend a small for one person or a large for two people to share.    My husband ordered the traditional broth with beef, because he wanted to try shabu in the traditional way it is supposed to be served.  Well, he regretted it because it was completely flavorless.  The \"broth\" was water with one piece of dried seaweed in it.  I ordered the \"spicy\" broth, which was not authentic Japanese, but quite tasty.  It reminded me of Korean spicy tang soup- and was just the right amount of spicy-ness.  They also pass around a condiment tray with different toppings like green onion, hot pepper powder, and ground radish- I recommend using one of not all of these for flavor in the broth.  Mine became a yummy Korean spicy stew (Soon Dubu Jigae) before the night was over.  You are served a large tray of mixed vegetables and tofu to put into the soup.  The beef was tender and had great flavor, but the cut of pork used tasted just like Holiday Ham, which did not go well with the flavor of the soup.  Maybe it would go better with some mashed potatoes and a side of cranberry sauce.  The meal also comes with two sauces; one a ponzu type and one a peanut/sesame type sauce.  I liked the ponzu more because the strength of the sauce held up well against the strong meat flavors.  Rice and a complimentary dessert are also served."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time here with my friend! And boy that was a good meal. Japanese comfort food par excellence! I order the B combo of lamb. The soup was light and comforting on a rainy and cold night! What i like about this place is the they give you a nice presented place of veggi will a bit of everything (carrot,daikon, broccoli, spinach, cabbage, seaweed, mushroom, tofu, bok choy, udon). The house sauce is so yummy with rice will definitively come back during the winter time"}
{"text":"Definitely a unique dining experience. We enjoyed it. The wait staff is open to requests, so if your broth isn't boiling, you can ask them to increase the heat. If you want to try another option or get more noodles, ask. Good food and easy to find options for vegetarians."}
{"text":"First time at an authentic hot pot restaurant and was semi satisfied. The experience is definitely fun, but the food is just okay. I had the spicy broth because most people claim that the traditional and chicken broths are too bland (definitely agree.. Fiance's chicken broth tasted like nothing). We both had the beef and had to order a side order of beef on top of that as well as two sides of mushroom. This was because the restaurant wouldn't accommodate our request of switching out the rice and noodles for salad or extra veggies.. So it was not very filling. Overall, a cool experience, but won't be returning. 3 stars for cleanliness, price, and concept. If you want food that tastes great, this is not the place for you..."}
{"text":"Chez Kagayaki, on peut déguster du boeuf, de l'agneau, du porc, du poulet ou encore des fruits de mer dans un choix de trois bouillons : poulet, traditionnel ou épicé. Pour ma part, j'ai essayé le boeuf trempé (pas plus de 20 secondes!) dans le bouillon épicé, et j'ai adoré la tendreté et le goût de la viande.  L'assiette de viande vient avec une généreuse portion de légumes incluant du chou chinois, des épinards, des carottes, du navet, des champignons enoki mais aussi du tofu, des nouilles udon et du riz collant. Il y a aussi des algues wakamé en entrée (qui ont un goût trop marin pour moi)."}
{"text":"I love saying the word Shabu Shabu, so here goes:  the place is a quiet respite from most of the other Chinatown restos. Most people are seated at the counter and we basically cook our own food in the broth.  I'm not an expert, but i get the impression this food is very healthy, lots of vegetables and not too much meat. It's a fun experience but the traditional broth i chose lacked flavor and i would recommend to talk to the waiter and ask for suggestions.  I have been to a Mongolian hot pot in the same area and that one was too spicy.  I would not mind going back and trying more, the prices are more than fair considering the effort put into this setup"}
{"text":"Hard to find if you are not looking at the numbers on the buildings for the address and then still hard to find. A bit stark/cold feeling atmosphere. I'm not sure why all the high ratings except if maybe when people eat in a novel way they lose sight of what they are actually getting for their money. Service was pleasant and reasonably attentive. The veggie plate looks impressive the way they arrange about $0.75 cost worth of veggies. And for $15 to $20 total you get maybe 2 ounces of meat but it's cut so thin it looks like a decent portion. Only one ponzu dipping sauce but that might be what's traditional I'm no shabu expert. So you'll just have to fill up on cabbage, broth and rice! I would have to spend about $30 here to get the protein I'd get at a $9 teriyaki joint. Still, it Is unique to cook your own food. But in my opinion this place is a very poor value for the amount of protein you get.  Borderline scammish .   I'd rather hit Pho Bac 97 for half the price and just as if not more meat, more filling and the broth actually tastes rich. Only difference is they dump your meat in for you right before they serve it. But if you want to pay double to have a burner in front of you so you can dump your own meat in, be my guest. Or their sucker rather.  You might see other reviews saying something to the effect of \"the experience was fun\"  but to me dropping $25 and being hungry 20 minutes later isn't fun."}
{"text":"Back to shabu shabu ( A Japanese kind of fondu) Improved my technique and I now have a greater appreciation of this style of food Very healthy and very tasty  Hint: Meat 15 seconds Radish, carrots, brocoli and cabagge 3-5 min (I suggest more than less) All others 1 min  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Shabu shabu. Boiled meat. Boiled vegetables. Really...would you even do this at home? Flavorless."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of fondue, in terms of making it myself or going somewhere to get it. I was hoping Hanashima would change my idea that good hot pot in Montreal is really not possible. Honestly, this place doesn't do it for me. I came for the first time with my boyfriend awhile back and we ordered I believe the regular broth with just vegetables, no meat.  The broth was flavorless and bland, and the vegetables were very little on a rectangular plate. It was very expensive for what was given. I think it was an extra 5 or 6 dollars for more vegetables...which is strange because vegetables shouldn't be that expensive. The only decent dish we ordered was the salad, but even that was given in such a small portion. I prefer Mongolian in terms of broth/soup base. They have more flavor and taste. Service was ok, but food did not live up to my standards."}
{"text":"This place was interesting. The service was a little slow and the food was good but nothing amazing. My favorite part was the coffee float that came with the lunch."}
{"text":"ok spot for lunch - the whole 'fondue' thing is interesting, and service is good"}
{"text":"A regular haunt of ours for special date nights and celebrations. The perfect winter meal, although you come home smelling a bit like soup. We just tried the new menu--outstanding! Try the new Sukiyaki broth--it was so flavorful and really comforting. I kept making yummy noises with every spoonful until my husband had to try it. They serve it with a raw egg as an additional  dipping sauce, which isn't my thing, so I just cooked the egg in the broth the further enhance the soup (sort of like egg drop soup, which I guess is not Japanese, but hey.) Still thinking about it and wondering when I can go again.  New side dishes to dunk in as well. We had the Korean rice cakes and the fish balls. I would order more fish balls next time, if possible. And new noodle choices and meat options as well. The long awaited chicken was okay, but the lamb and beef were the star proteins. Next time I'll order the two different cuts of beef (which is a new option) and the lamb.  Be aware that you get less broth than before, but who can finish it, anyway? Also you do get charged $1.00 for ordering extra rice, when it used to be free. The new chocolate ice cream covered in rice cake was yummy, but too frozen, so the ice cream was a bit hard and not as creamy as I would have liked.  Overall, the new changes were great and the whole experience was a ton of fun, as usual. Arigato, Chef Kagayaki! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been there for a long time. I loved this place for it's table d'hôte. You get a good yummy portion for a decent price.   I came back lately and I have to say that it feels different, of course. I was surprised to find corn and tomato in the vegs plate or the spinach instead of the wakame, but I think it's still worth going back!  The waitresses are friendly and will answer your questions the best they can. The place kept its big 'U' table - I like this feature of the restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Went sunday for brunch with boyfriend and was not disspointed! Didnt know thus restaurant existed until searching for food on yelp. Got the lamb bruch for myself and boyfriend got the angus AAA one with extra meat platter. Loved the matcha latte and the cofee with ice crean. Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere and the service was great. Spicy broth with vegetables was pretty good! Chocolate dessert at the end was perfect"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Shabu Shabu places I've been to. The spicy broth that I had was delicious. Tthe options for vegetarian food were not bad. I had vegetables, mushrooms, and noodles. The decor and environment were relaxed and nice. When I went it was very snowy outside, so the shabu shabu really hit the spot. There were very few other people so we did not have a problem with the service."}
{"text":"This place does great shabu shabu. It just turns out I'm not that crazy about this dish. I'm giving them 4 stars anyway because I still like it and gladly tag along when friends want to eat here.  It's a little bit difficult to locate the restaurant from the street since there is no obvious sign and the entrance is up some narrow stairs. From the outside the place doesn't look all that, but once you're inside it's really nice and clean.  About the broth choices: the traditional one is almost like water, chicken has a very mild taste (I add tons of green onions and shichimi \"seven flavor chili pepper\") and finally the spicy one is the most flavorful. The combos come with a pickled vegetables appetizer, steamed rice, dipping sauces and dessert. Both times I was there my friends asked the waitress for the sesame sauce so I don't know if they bring it if you don't. It goes great with the meat so definitely ask for it! I also recommend the dumplings as a nice meat addition to your platter."}
{"text":"Went here because I really love shabu shabu and wanted to see how it compared to the ones in LA and its not as weird to sit alone when you're doing a bar style restaurant.   It was kind of hard to find the place because it was upstairs, It took me a while to find it especially because It was my first time in Montreal.   I came in and it was fairly slow, but I did see there were multiple reserved signs around me. I ordered the beef.  Their ponzu sauce tasted a little diffferent, I can't seem to put my finger on it, there was something lipstickey about it, if that makes sense.   The beef was a little too thick and didn't have the \"melt in your mouth\" aspect that I'm used to.  The service was decent, and the server was somewhat friendly.   What was also pretty nice, was that there was dessert that came with the meal.   pretty much-- this place didn't exactly wow me, nor did it completely disappoint me.   \"EHH\""}
{"text":"Asked not to stay if the 2yr with us was going to be loud.  At that point the child had not said a word, but we were warned we better take him outside if he gets \"loud\".  We decided not to stay. The place was not even close to full. Won't be back."}
{"text":"INADMISSIBLE. On a fait une réservation à 19h30, à 20h10 on avait toujours pas de table. Ils nous ont fait assoire puis finalement nous ont demandé de  nous relever car il y  avait un groupe!"}
{"text":"Hot pot is hot pot, which is always good and this place is no exception. The food was just as good as any other hot pot place I have visited.  The staff here, however, are not very friendly, nor helpful. Our waitress asked us to order almost as soon as we sat down. We told her we needed to look at the menu and she didn't even answer- she just walked away. At the end of our meal, after receiving the bill, we put the credit card down and waited... and waited... about 20 minutes. In hind sight, we could have asked or flagged down the waitress but it seemed she was avoiding us all together. We finally saw others pay at the little stand and got up to pay also, after wasting time just sitting there and no one telling us to go pay at the stand. SO THERE'S A GOOD TIP!  Atmosphere: It was kind of creepy how quiet the place was. There were about 5 other patrons, but no one talked and if they did, it was a whisper. We were here on a Saturday afternoon (around 5pm) so it was just unusual.  The food was a bit pricey, but that's to be expected with hot pot. Nothing new there."}
{"text":"I thought the prices were a bit high, but the dinner was pretty delicious.  Despite almost the entire restaurant being booked for what appeared to be a wedding party, the staff was pretty attentive.  We needed some hand-holding as well wen it came to the menu, so their patience was appreciated.  Great food, nice service, but a bit pricey.  We would go back though!"}
{"text":"This place was great! My first experience in a Shabu Shabu type restaurant! I had the beef/veggie combo which was excellent, but I think the next time the meat will be enough. Very good quality food, and people were really nice.  You each have your own pot of broth, and your meat cooks in less then 15 seconds! Very cool restaurant. I will be going back soon"}
{"text":"Mmmm...shabu shabu!  It had been a year since I had shabu shabu and boy did I miss it.  Ugh, sad face, since I had to go to Montreal to get it.  I kind of wish I could move to Montreal, if only Canada would have me!  Anyway.  The place was on top of their game.  It wasn't too crowded, the food came out fast and the meat was fresh and delicious.  I went with the traditional broth and my boyfriend got the spicy.  The traditional was great but I kind of liked the spicy more. I also love the counter environment.  Price wise I don't think it was too bad.  All I know is after we were done eating I was in a food coma.  I kind of remember leaving and walking, a lot.  After the food had settled, maybe an hour or two later, I was good to go.    Shabu Shabu places tend to run the same lines in regards to menu items.  Where they differ is service and decor.  Hanashima, has both my friends.  Next time I'm in Montreal I will make the trip back in."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my wife and 3yr old boy right after the lunch crowd-1:30ish. Place was clean and the staff was friendly (albeit small). We had the lunch special which is basically less meat and veg. -9.95ish  Spicy broth tasted good, but not necessarily spicy..more like flavorful.   Good for us to get our jones for shabu, shabu,... But does not compare to Boston area etc."}
{"text":"This is one of the very few places that serves Shabu Shabu in Montreal. As much as I anticipated to have some nice Japanese hot pot in a still cold March, this place is not what I have expected it to be.  It was on a Sunday night when I went to dine in this restaurant, with around only 6 people currently eating around the round table of hot pots, excluding me and my friend. As it turned out to be, selections were very limited as there were only 3 flavors for the broth, and only two dipping sauces (soy sauce and peanut butter sauce). The dipping sauces were underwhelming as it did not mesh with the veggies/meat fairly well. I ordered the spicy broth as people stated that it's more flavorful while my friend ordered the chicken broth. I find that the spicy broth was also bland along with the chicken broth....the broth only had pepper powder mixed so it tasted similar to that.  On top of the burn to such a delicate Japanese style meal, service was VERY slow; it took them over 20 minutes to bring a cold pot of broth to us, and we had to wait an extra 5 minutes for it to be heated. The meat slices were way too thin for me to enjoy such delicacy either. If this place wants a second chance, I would be anticipating for a variety of broth and dipping sauces and faster service considering that there were only 6 people dining and it took them that long to give me the meal. +1 star because we got mango ice cream for free."}
{"text":"La cuisine japonaise, si on exclut les tempuras, est sans doute une des plus saines qui soit, et peut-être explique-t-elle la longévité extraordinaire de ce peuple qui ne l'est pas moins.  On en a un bon exemple avec ce restaurant.  Abandondance de légumes (dont certains que je n'avais jamais vu en-dehors du Japon, comme la racine de lotus), et une absence presque totale de gras ou d'huile.  J'y suis allé un midi, et la portion était convenable pour ce moment de la journée (et pour 10$, c'était vraiment parfait).  Je suis sorti satisfait, mais léger.  Les saveurs étaient tout à fait typiques de ce que j'avais goûté au Japon et ça m'a fait chaud au coeur de les retrouver à si bas prix en plein coeur du centre-ville."}
{"text":"I needed to add this business to this website for 2 reasons: 1, it's awesome and authentical. 2: My friend believes restomontreal.ca is a better restaurant review website than Yelp. So as I prefer Yelp and wanted to proove him wrong, I needed to add that business.  One of the issue I got with Japanese cuisine in Montreal it's that it's mostly marginalize in Sushi and Crazy Chef mumbling funny stuff and doing a flame while cooking your shrimps. I went to 2 great Japanese restaurant in my life and one of them is Mikado and the other one is Hanashima.   Mikado would be more in the Modern New Japanese cuisine style with some really talented chef and Hanashima would be more into the Traditional Japanese Cuisine. Now, I'm not an expert, but my friend is really into Japanese stuff and knows more about it. From what I understand, Traditional Japanese cuisine focuses on the taste and quality of the food.   The menu is quite simple. The restaurant is welcoming and it kind of feel like a bar with the exception that it's japanese fondue restaurant!  You have 3 choices of broth. Chicken, Neutral (algae) and Spicy (which I was told is really spicy). Then you choose your sides. Vegetarian will be happy to find some great vegetable and meat lover will be happy to find their meat too. It's one of the most healthy meal you can have: Boiled in a great broth, with sides of rice and soya sauce and peanut sauce, this meal is so simple, yet so good and CHEAP, that it's worth a 5Stars.  Alcool + Shrimps + Meat plates and Veggie plates, + Chicken Broth with Tip cost me 40-45$. Plan at least 1-2 hours for your meal."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Located in Chinatown, this is an affordable and enjoyable experience. If you haven't tried Shabu Shabu before, you don't know what you're missing. The variety will mean everyone is pleased and you will leave happy and full. The lunch and dinner combos are flexible and customizable.please give it a try. The staff will guide you through your first shabu shabu experience."}
{"text":"Shabu Shabu aka Japanese fondue has a home in Montreal!  This is  actually a really fun place to eat at. Seating is around a horse-shoe shaped counter/bar  which takes up the whole restaurant. You have a choice of broths (spicy or traditional) and you choose which kinds of meats and veggies you'd like. You're also given a bowl of rice on the side. You \"cook\" the thinly sliced meat in your broth   a la fondue style along with the veggies.  Everything is super fresh and super healthy. You can overeat all you want here and don't have to feel bad about it afterwards at all! It's a great cheap date spot!"}
{"text":"Food was good but portions are conservative and service was really slow. I think they might have been down a server that evening and it was quite busy but it took about half an hour before someone served us tea and took our order."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant almost every week end for the past few years and I can't get tired of it !! The food is so good, the place is very clean and the owner very nice. You can mix the broth for more flavors. Also try the japanese soda called ramune, very good !"}
{"text":"Solid shabu shabu. Wish they had some leaner beef. Make sure to get the spicy broth"}
{"text":"Such a fun place! Playing with your food :) Especially in groups!   Everyone have their own individual hot pot so no worries of losing your piece of food and for it getting it picked by someone else ;)  They serve the hotpot with a seaweed salad and a marinated cucumber at the beginning.  They also include a soya sauce as well as very yummy sesame sauce. You can choose either a vegetable, a meat or a seafood platter.  The two latter includes a large vegetable platter with interesting choices such as chinese radishes, udon noodles, bok choi, several types of mushrooms, etc.  If you choose the vegetable option, you will only have a larger vegetable platter than others.  You are also allowed two bowls of rice (most people dont know it!) There is a certain order in which you should add your ingredient in order to optimize your experience and not find yourself with overcooked or undercooked items.  As for the broth, I strongly recommend the spicy one since I find the others quite bland.  They also have a seasoning wheel you can ask where you can add green onions, chili powder or radish puree. Finally, a dessert is included!  Affordable, healthy an fun way to enjoy a meal between friends :)"}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés deux fois jusqu'à présent. Pour le côté nourriture, il y a beaucoup de choix quand même.  J'ai pris le repas du soir table d'hôte. Cela inclus un choix de nouilles, petites salade coréenne, riz, choix de viandes, choix de bouillon, thé à volonté, choix de dessert, choix d'accompagnement ainsi que légumes.  J'ai toujours aimé à date. Je prends toujours le bouillon épicé, le tout avec du boeuf (j'ai essayé les deux variété, je suis moins fan du rib-eye, plus de nerfs/gras mais c'est ce style de coupe de viande qui est ainsi). Je n'ai pas essaé les nouilles, le riz ni les desserts étend donnée mon régime (kéto) stricte. Par contre, les légumes avec la viande cuite dans le bouillon, excellent. Comme accompagnement, j'ai pris les meat balls la 2e fois (la 1ère fois il n'y en avait plus alors j'ai pris du tofu que j'ai donnée à ma copine).  Ma copine aussi est venu avec moi les deux fois. Elle a essayé le bouillon terriyaki. Elle a vraiment bien aimé. Suivant le même régime que moi, elle a donc les même restrictions. Donc comme accompagnement, elle a pris le tofu (qu'elle aime de toute façon).  Le choix d'accompagnement est tout de même grand, il y a 4 ou 6 bouillons différents, 3-4 desserts et plusieurs choix de drink. On peut prendre en table d'hôte ou simplement commander à la carte. La table d'hôte du soir reste très avantageuse pour le prix (20-25$). J'ai vu qu'il y a un autre menu pour le midi mais je n'ai pas eu la chance encore de le goûter.  Le point en moins est pour le service. La 1ère fois, j'y suis allé pendant le festival Otakuthon au palais des congrès. Nous avons été servi et manger en 1h30, ce qui est excellent pour une fondu. La 2e fois que j'y suis allé, nous sommes arrivés autour de 19h30 et nous sommes sortit vers 22h45. Nous avons attendu pendant 45 minutes pour avoir une place (il y en avait plusieurs de disponible mais non nettoyé) et un coup assit, 30 minutes pour prendre la commande, le bouillon est arrivé environ 25 minutes plus tard mais sans allumé le feu, et le reste est arrivé dans les 30-45 minutes suivantes.  Je ne blâme pas le staff, ils étaient 3 pour tout faire, ce qui inclus prendre les commandes, ramasser, amener les commandes, préparer les plats dans la cuisine, accueillir les nouveaux, leurs assignés une place, faire les factures, effectué les paiements, expliqué le fonctionnement du restaurant... Bref, c'était des cuisinier/caissier/placier/serveuse.  Je vais y retourné c'est sûr, espérons simplement que le management aura été améliorer rendu là."}
{"text":"Super resto de shabu shabu (fondue japonaise) en plein quartier chinois. Le midi on peut manger pour vraiment pas cher un set complet soupe miso, plat avec riz, glace et thé vert chaud pour une dizaine de dollars. C'est très bon et les saveurs sont vraiment japonaises. C'est un plat de saisons froides mais pour ma part je suis capable d'en manger toute l'année.   La déco est épurée avec un comptoir en \"U\", ce qui est sympa mais pas pratique quand on est en groupe. Devant chaque personne il y a un petit réchaud pour faire bouillir sa viande et ses légumes dans un bouillon épicé où à l'algue kombu (n'ayez crainte, c'est très bon) . Il y a également les habituelles sauces ponzu et goma (sésame) pour tremper les légumes et la viande. Miam !   C'est sain, c'est bon et c'est pas cher et c'est vraiment proche de ce qu'on peut gouter au Japon. C'est une opportunité de s'essayer à un plat familial japonais, alors ne passez pas à côté !   Et si vous poussez un peu votre curiosité, je vous conseil l'acool de prune \"umeshu\" c'est délicieux !"}
