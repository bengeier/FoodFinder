{"text":"Discovered this newly opened restaurant and I was very glad that I did! They advertise that they offer Mongolian food, but they also have some northern Chinese items as well. My experience was already off to a good start when they gave me complimentary corn and egg white soup along with bread sticks (fried with a sweet taste), and both of which were pretty enjoyable, especially since they were free ;) We ordered a beef pancake which I really enjoyed b/c it was overflowing with juices. We also got the stewed beef ribs and bread. The bread tasted awesome with the sauce, and for some reason the beef had a taste of lamb with it. Not sure if this was intentional, or simply b/c they cook both meets in the same wok. Regardless I personally enjoyed the dish BUT for those who don't like lamb I may have to caution you against it.  Service was also very polite, which is not common among chinese establishments, but I'm happy that it exists here.   They also have special menu combos for large groups which I intend on trying out with the family soon!! I am also happy to see a Mongolian restaurant that does not involve a grill/bbq. Very welcome addition to the Chinese food scene in the GTA and adds some much needed variation!  Minor point of irritation: Very cumbersome seats. Very hard to pull out the heavy seats from the table, especially on the carpet that they have."}
{"text":"I really can't stand this restaurant any longer, I have given them three chances to redeemed themselves and I left completely disappointed in the quality of food.  I surely, will not be returning. The portions are tiny and ridiculously over priced, even for a 'fancy' over decorated theatre."}
{"text":"The best way to describe my lunch at Li's would be the equivalent of being on a mild-mannered roller coaster.   That moment when you see the ride,  anticipating the conquer:  Li's posts their menu on the restaurant window, revealing an extensive list of dishes from northern China and Mongolia. $5-8 lunch specials from the land of lamb and carb heaven? You had me at Mongolian lamb pancake. Upon stepping in, you will find a fancy decor for an Asian place, upholstered chairs and wait staff dressed in traditional Malaysian clothing. Ookay okay.   That first tease of a downhill:  We went on a weekend. They don't offer the lunch specials as advertised outside on the weekend. Drat. Should have read the fine print, the devil is in the details.   That slightly bigger second bump:  The downside of a very diverse menu was the labouring process that ordering food-for-two turned into. Think a large hard cover book binded with 15+ pages of ambiguous categories, lost in translation English titles, and blown-up photos of the dishes. The latter just aggravates our growling stomachs even more.   The climb:   Service is pretty good for an Asian restaurant, waiter speaks enough English to provide us with some recommendations that we agree on. The anticipation grows as we wait for their most popular dishes, Stewed Beef Ribs with Bread and Mongolian Lamb Pancakes, to arrive.   The climax:  The Stewed Beef Ribs with Bread. Beef is well marinated and has that chewy-but-not-too-soft texture. The bread is not your traditional \"mantou\", but slightly deep fried \"mantou\" folded in layers.  The drop: The highly anticipated Mongolian Pancakes. Not a bad dish overall, but I think my expectations were set really high because of the exotic sounding \"Mongolian\" prefix in the title. They're just ordinary green onion pancakes with lamb instead of the usual beef. Pancake was on the thicker side so ratio of pancake to meat was not ideal.  To conclude: I would recommend this place if you're already in First Markham Place, and craving the Asian version of comfort food. And bring more friends, so you can try out more things on the menu, since each dish is not cheap at $18-20. Or with your Markham-nese parents, who will foot the bill."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and this was one of the better Chinese restaurants I have been to. Decor is better than most Asian restaurants and the menu is quite large in size and offerings.  The menu has images for most of the items being sold which is great if you not familiar with the dishes. Some images may be stock images since the image on the menu and what you actually end up with on your plate can vary sometimes but nothing that the taste of the food cannot overcome.  The sauces are very flavourful compared to most other restaurants and tastes fresher.  Will definitely visit here again to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"I came here with my fiancé for lunch and I was wow'd by the decor. It was done tastefully and it was clean! The two waitresses was very pleasant and nice, which was an eye opener.  We ordered their $6.99 lunch special of cumin lamb and sweet and sour fish filet. The portions were generous and it came with soup and 2 cold appetizers. The soup was quite good, not your typical watered down soup, it had plentiful diced wintermelon, seaweed and pieces of diced pork. The tofu appetizer had a nice sesame oil flavour and the cabbage had a nice Szechuan pepper taste!  My fiancé had the cumin lamb tho he enjoyed it but he said he had better elsewhere, meanwhile I did enjoy his cumin lamb (not too oily). As for my sweet and sour fish, it was really really good! The sauce was just right and the filet are lightly battered and crispy, and not oily at all.  We will definitely come back to try out their other items!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my lunch experience at Li's House 1988.   The lunch menu is quite extensive with entree, noodles, dim sum and more. We ordered a few items to share so we can have a taste of what they offers before we come back for dinner.  ????? ($7.99) Mongolian Lamb Noodle Soup - tasted homemade in a bad way ??? ($4.50) Steamed Soup Dumpling - doughy and heavy Veggie Pancake ($2.50) - hardly have any filling ???? ($2.50) Red Bean Pancake   I found most of the dish we ordered were mediocre at best.   The waitress though looks cute in her Mongolian costume but I care more about how the food taste.  I doubt I would be back any time soon...."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant, especially all lamb dishes. Because Inner Mongolia is famous for lamb meat and  dishes."}
{"text":"Coming here for the second time I found it just OK compared to the first time where we ordered lots of lamb.  We mainly ordered veggies this time around. Next time I will make sure I order lamb their specialty."}
