{"text":"The show was pretty decent but I found the two overly flamboyant homosexual characters to be pretty offensive. It is 2015 and no longer acceptable to portray gay people this way. 

The service was dismal. Honestly, I think it was the worst service I have ever had. We booked three tables for my office Christmas party. First, neither host/hostess could find our reservation, although I easily found it on their sheet and pointed it out to them. Next, we sat down and ordered drinks right away but they didn't arrive until we were well into our second course over 30 minutes later. When we mentioned the long wait, we were advised to order our second round of drinks now if we wanted to see them by the main course so we did. That round of drinks arrived promptly which resulted in everyone having two full drinks in front of them. 

The server insisted that we begin to order food as soon as our first table was all seated, even though I asked if we could wait until our whole party had arrived. This is basic etiquette! As a result we all had soup in front of us as the others were arriving and mine was ice cold by the time I was able to actually eat it because as the host of the event, I had to get up and greet everybody and distribute drink tickets as they arrived. 

The tables were so close together that you must sit with your stomach literally touching the table (I am not an overweight person) and the servers still cannot get in behind your chair to serve you. All night we were continually asked to pass food and drinks down to the end of the table. By the time my plate reached me about five people's thumbs had dipped into my food. Then we had to bus each other's messy plates afterward as well. The chairs are also very uncomfortable, especially for the length of time you are sitting.

At the beginning of the night the server asked if there were any dietary restrictions and I let him know I was vegetarian. He kindly brought me a tomato basil soup but then brought out a salad with bacon on it. Main course was vegetarian lasagna with vegetables. The vegetables were greasy, the lasagna was salty and everything was ice cold.  

At the end of the night we would have loved to sit and talk for a while but the bus staff came and asked us to begin bussing our own table (passing every dirty dish and glass down to the end). She then dropped several glasses which broke on the table and she asked us all to leave so she could clean it. We were literally kicked out 3 minutes after the show ended.

I understand why they demand gratuities be paid in full at the time of purchase because none of these people would ever see a tip otherwise. I am embarrassed I recommended this place for our company Christmas party and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Last night was my first ever visit to Jubilations, yes, a little embarassing considering I'm a block away. And I loved it!

The show we saw was 'Greased', so yes, a Grease theme, but with some Albertan twists to the fun story. We heard some of the classic Grease songs, with some other popular ones from the time. The cast was funny, entertaining, and made the visit by staying in character the whole time.

The whole evening is fun! You definitely aren't bored between acts, and in total they probably had about 15 audience members participate. Even we did! and we got some free drinks for making slight fools of ourselves. 

At our table, we had 3 of the 4 main course options and all were received very well. All of the food was delicious! 

I will for sure be returning for the next show (I think it starts in November) and will probably buy one of the ticket packs as it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Loved the show...funny and good singing/dancing..food was good..went with a group of 5. If you have a chance to go to any show? Go"}
{"text":"Actors usually make a living as waiters, but at Jubilations they get to do it all. Some of the characters from the play take your order and stay in character the whole time. (Which explained why our food at one of the plays took so long -- our waiter was dressed as a Canada Post employee).
But the play -- no matter which one -- is always entertaining and a good time. The food was great (although not much of a selection) and everyone seemed to be having a laugh. The food comes out in courses, sometimes up to an hour between. But the entertainment grabs your attention. A play and dinner at Jubilations usually takes three hours, but the time flies."}
{"text":"We arrived on time and were pleasantly greeted to the cast opening the doors which much enthusiasm and energy. It was a wonderful way to start off our evening with our children and friends.

We were escorted to our table which I was not expecting to be such great seats as it was up in the corner on the third level, but the seats were perfect!  As we were at the railing our children had a  unconstructed view. Thanks  Box Offfice for recommending that spot.

I have gone to Jubilations many times and have enjoyed the performance and the servers, but this time was one of my favorites. The servers were so enjoyable. My children were laughing and trying to come up with ways to stump the servers with questions about the universe. In a world of so much technology which my children ages 14, 11, and 8 readily buy into and are always bored without the iPod - we're kept entertained and engaged the whole time. Not once was I asked \"can I play on your phone\". My youngest was upset when the lights came on after the first act because he thought it was over. He is always wanting to go home early, but not this evening.

The soup and main course were great - I had the prime rib and once my oldest tried it he wanted more.  The salad in my opinion could have been better and the desert was good. As it was a little late for my children to eat they were still hungry after the soup, salad and buns, so we asked if we could have more buns and they brought out more which made the kids happy. My poor daughter ordered the chocolate cake which I do not usually like and it was really good. She ended up having to share with everyone. I really liked the non alcoholic special drink they had and how it was presented. The glasses had bubbles which made the kids feel special. At one point my son had asked the server for more crackers well he was given a whole basket full and he did his best to eat them all - it was so funny.

The performance was great. The actors got into their characters on and off the stage which added to the evening. The story line was not complicated and enjoyable for all ages. I did not have to answer a lot of questions.  We noticed the drawings on the wall represented parts of the story and my children were constantly waiting for the scenes with the drawings to come into the show and I found I too was waiting.  The kids were so thrilled when they noticed the drawings come into the show.  This added to our evening by keeping us all engaged in the whole experience. My evening was so much more enjoyable because my children were kept entertained. At one point in the show there was a comical passionate scene, the clown waiter was waiting for it an covered my youngest sons eyes - we all were laughing. It was the little things that the severs did that turned a nice evening into a memorable event for our Anniversary. 

I am so glad we decided to spend our Anniversary this way. My husband and I were able to get up and dance on stage to a romantic song with all the other couples to celebrate our special day. I strongly recommend Jubilations for all ages as it is fun for all."}
{"text":"I went to Jubilations for the first time with my cousin to see Sherlock Holmes and it was pretty awesome.

We had a server who played a character named Handy Hank and he was hilarious. I'm not sure if they were playing actual characters or their own made up one though, but I definitely saw a guy dressed up as Fred from Scooby Doo! 

The actors and actresses were really good, especially their singing. They were a joy to watch and were funny. The thing though was that the whole event lasted about 5 hours long! By the end I was getting restless, fidgety, and wanting the play to end soon. 

What I really didn't enjoy was the food. The salad dressing tasted like a weird mixture of medicine and fruit juice. My cousin had the fish and rice - both of which were overcooked. Her portions were skimpy as well.
I had the steak. It was bland and definitely needed salt. 
Dessert was great though. Mmmm, chocolate cake... 

All in all a great time, just don't expect much from the food."}
{"text":"My family have lived in the area for years and always make a point of going to each Jubilations show when it comes out.  Over the last 4-5 years the shows have been consistently good and the food even more so. 

 We used to go here because it was close to our home but we now go for the truly wonderful food.  The cooks seem to take so much care in their food and presentation.  Each show we look forward to what we will find on the menu and have yet to be disappointed.  The only negative thing I can think of to say about the food is that over the years it has no doubt been responsible for at least part of the fact that some of my clothes seem to be getting tighter.

 The shows themselves are almost always very funny and the singing in them is generally topnotch.  Our servers are usually playing a character while they work and waiting to see what our waiter is playing is one of our favorite parts of the night."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and this is always a go to on girls night out.  It's nice to be entertained while having dinner as well.  The show we watched was very funny and the food is always great."}
{"text":"Job well done to the cast and crew! I was going to leave a 4 star because there was some confusion with the bills and took forever to pay...but a 5 was more fitting because the entire experience was above average.

The biggest difference I noticed from previous visits...is that the staff have been trained to provide exceptional customer service. Their sense of urgency to correct issues, the servers checking to ensure food and drinks were perfect...and if not...they would fix immediately. I definitely felt they went out of the way to ensure we have an exceptional experience. Whether we needed more food, more sauce, or drinks....they were prepared to do whatever it took.

Additionally, the show was great and well organized with appropriate breaks and entertainment.  

I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Last weekend I went and checked out \"Luck Be A Lady\" at Jubilations Dinner Theatre. I had never been and I will be the first to tell you that Jubilations is now my favourite theatre in town. 

From the moment we walked in, I was impressed. Their theatre is beautiful, way better than Stage West if you ask me, and their cast & crew are wonderful! What I especially loved is that the moment you step foot inside, you're transported into a realm in which EVERYONE is part of the production. From the usher who takes you to your table, to your server, to the guy who pours your drinks; Everyone is in character. 

Now let's get to the food. Excellent. I have a bit of a strict eating regiment, so we called ahead and the chef made me a meal based on specific ingredients that I can eat! SO considerate! Plus with soup, salad, an entree and dessert, there's no chance you're going to leave this place even remotely hungry. 

The production was excellent, the theatre was beautiful, the staff was professional, the cast & crew were magnificient, the meal was delicious, and the entire evening was one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"I can't stress enough that you shouldn't go here if you're just looking for a nice date night. My partner and I went out just the two of us and once we arrived were surprised to find that all the tables are long and meant for up to 6 people so if you're a couple then you'll be squished into a long table with 4 other strangers. It's definitely a place meant for families, work gatherings, and big friend groups.

The show itself was fun, funny, and upbeat.  The actors were all young and talented, and the theater production was great.  

My only complaint aside from the tables would be the servers, specifically the girl that served me and my partner.  They all were entertaining and did their own little characters to try and liven up the experience and I appreciate that but its obvious that they want you to buy alcohol to earn extra cash and tips and I completely understand why (since I myself don't earn a large wage and live paycheck to paycheck). Me and my partner aren't drinkers unfortunately so we just got coffee and were taken aback by the sudden cold hostility from our server. She treated us poorly for the rest of the evening and truly tainted some of the evening for me.

Overall it was a nice new experience but again I definitely wouldn't recommend couples coming here unless you're with a big group. And for all those who aren't big drinkers I warn you that you may not get the best server experience."}
{"text":"Now lets be honest, these dinner theatres are not my jam. 
But my sister and lady love it, so I go fairly often. Now, Gentleman, I dont dislike going, the drinks are good, the food good, and the performance is usually pretty entertaining, but this isnt really for me. I go, a lot, because of people in my life. So because of that, only 4 stars, and of the 5 or 6 ive been to in my life I can say this one is good!
And everybody really does give it their all so thats important as well."}
{"text":"First time here. The mushroom soup was delicious, the salad was very good with cranberries and almonds, the chicken Kiev was absolutely out of this world. My son would have gladly had seconds. I really enjoyed the vegetables with the chicken. The roasted potatoes were a bit dry and the desserts (strawberry rhubarb pie and chocolate fudge pecan caramel cake) were average.....nothing to write home about. Great job with service! Couldn't ask for better. The show was very well done. A wonderful evening all around."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Went with my wife and parents last weekend and was blown away! It was our first time and I can assure you we are already planning our next visit! The food was great (we splurged for the prime rib) and the veggies were cooked very well (although I don't think they used any seasoning on them which is just personal preference, so I can't bag them out about that). 

The performance was awesome! The best live theatre performance I've been to. The script was very well done, and being a fan of both the artist and the movie being portrayed really paid off but my wife isn't a fan of either and she loved the show just as much as i did! 

We will definitely be back for a full night of fun and entertainment!"}
{"text":"My friends and I sometimes go here depending on what they are offering.   Often in themed costumes of our own, study up on some songs and it's all really quite fun. 

The shows are usually musical parodies and the plays don't have amazing scripts but if you love the original they are spoofing you'll have a good time.  The actors are not unionized so they tend to be a little less experienced than the ones you'll see in Stage West (which they will be unable to work at).  Eventually these guys may join the union and go into bigger productions so generally they tend to be quite young -  fresh out of school and maybe  the top of their drama clubs or something.   Production value is still pretty high quality.

The food is acceptable but not delicious - there are vegetarian options which is nice.   The drinks are steep.   Overall it's about what you'd expect for a dinner and a play and if the show that's running is right for you then it's a great evening out. 

TIP: after the show, stop in at aussie rules right next door to add a little extra something to the night."}
{"text":"I love jubilation So much good food good people and that Chico guys really funny. I always have the best times there and tickets to jubilations always the best wedding gifts last birthday gifts."}
{"text":"Fantastic Family Outing!
Our family has attended the last 9 shows at Jubilations and we have never been disappointed!
We started going when my daughter was 10 and she loved everything - the excellent singing, the hilarious wait staff, the great kids menu, and that she got to stay up late!
No where else will you find a team of people working harder to entertain you than at Jubilations. Your server is in character the whole time, and participates in the live show in between bringing you your four course dinner! 
They are efficient, everything is well thought out, and boy can they sing! Always a great selection of classic rock, modern hits, and any other song that fits the current theme.
Birthdays and anniversaries are always acknowledged at Jubilations too, so it's a great place to celebrate with family where everyone will have a great time."}
{"text":"I've been to Jubilations many times over the years, but after the last show I attended, I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.

My friends and I decided to see the F.R.I.E.N.D.S Reunion show, as we're all big 'Friends' fans. We showed up at 6PM when doors open, and were seated in the far corner at the back - quite possibly the worst seats in the house - but not a big deal, we were there to enjoy each others company and the show. Our server was uncomfortably awkward, to the point where we weren't sure if it was her character or just HER. Drink orders were placed and soon we were taken through the menu and told we would be served both appetizers instead of having to choose one - wonderful! More food is always good news to us.

The soup and salad was decent, no complaints at all. We placed our entree order and the first act was underway. The performers were young, but they certainly could sing. However, the acting was painful at times, and the storyline was ALL over the place. There were a few laughs, but mostly it was a lot of \"WTF?\" looks between us, and after what seemed like hours, we were served our entrees. 

Between us, we ordered the Chicken, Salmon, and Beef dishes. The food was mediocre - not great, but decent enough to fill you up. The fact they are able to feed everyone a hot meal is impressive in itself. My problem was with the timing. Between acts, there was WAY too long of a wait. After eating our meals, we waited an additional 30 minutes to start the next act. Cue more bad acting, an unfunny script, but decent singing voices to at least keep us awake. Dessert break. Once again left waiting ages. Last act seemed to drag on, I was literally sitting with my eyes closed at one point. When it finally ended, we paid our bill and I checked the time - it was almost 11PM. 5 hours of my life that I will never get back.

We had a good time due to the company we were with, but I wont be seeing a show here again. In my opinion, it's way too expensive for the quality of food (plus we paid an additional $50 for drinks) and the production quality is amateur. There is no reason a show of this calibre should go on for FIVE HOURS and by the end of it I just wanted to get the hell out of there. Never again."}
{"text":"Since moving to Calgary about 8 years ago, I have always wanted to go to jubilations. I had heard good things, and that it was a really fun group experience. So when trying to think of something fun and new to do with our friends, we looked into it. Once we found out they were doing a \"friends reunion\" we all decided to go, because we all loved the show \"friends\" growing up. So we figured it would be a fun Friday night activity, better than the regular dinner night out.

On the website it gives NO information on how long the shows run, it just says seating times between 6:15-6:45. We arrived at 6:30. We didn't get out of there until 11 pm!! It was horrible!!! Honestly, I will never ever go back because of how awkward the whole experience was. 

The servers aka the \"additional cast\" are just creepy, not funny. At one point one of the girls came to pick up finished dinner plate- she commented on how I must like a lot of meat (I ordered the prime rib- very fatty), then started to lift the giant chunks of fat left over with a fork, and hovering above the plate, and making the same comment about loving meat to the point where the fat chunks almost fell into my lap? Wtf are you doing chick? In the show there was a part where \"Joey\" is running around in his boxers, this same girl was running after him trying to look up his boxers, and then afterwards ran around yelling \"I SAW IT!!! I SAW IT!!\" And then ran up to me and yelled that she saw his dick and it looked like Mount Everest. There were children there, it was beyond inappropriate. This isn't funny, it's just annoying. There were many many more awkward points with the servers, but it would take too long to explain them all. 

The food was not good, soup too salty to eat, salad was about 6 lettuce leaves, a couple bacon bits, 4 croutons on the side and a little cup of dressing on the side. The beef was ok, and the cake was ok. Drinks were over priced and they messed ours up several times. 

The show had a few funny parts, but honestly there is no reason in the world there needed to be such long breaks in between, and the show was just drawn out, with a lot of parts that made nooo sense at all, and related nothing to friends either. 

At 10:00 we were begging to leave, but it really does feel like you're held hostage. We wanted to try to leave and clear up our bill for the drinks but were told we had to wait for the manager in the additional actors crew to spilt up our bill first. We didn't get to leave until 11 pm. My god what amateur show needs to be 4 1/2 hours long? Our legs were cramping up, it was sheer torture to be honest.

All in all this was about $100 each person, go spend your money else where people, not worth it! I'm giving 2 stars because if the servers weren't \"acting\" the experience could be better, as well as if they shortened it all up to about 2 hours, it could have been fun. But with the way things went, I feel legit ripped off. There is no reason to charge this amount for what we got."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this venue.  It was fantastic.  Our dinner was hot, tasty, and very enjoyable.  I had the Prime Rib.  The portion was huge, and I ate it  all.  Enough to feed a small country.
The show was over the top great.  I complimented all the actor's after the show.  I hope I get a chance to come back again, and again.  Wish we had this kind of a place in our city."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up for   \"GhostBusted\" , SOOOO entertaining!
Loved the 80's music and many of them were ones I know and could sing along to! :)
Food was pretty good.  Our table ordered 2 chicken parms, 1 salmon, and 1 prime rib and the prime rib wins!!! It was soooo tender! :)  Definitely the best choice of the night.
All meals are served with soup (beef barley), salad (Cesar with dressing on side), and a bread & butter basket for the table.

There was singing, dancing, and comedy!! All the singing is done live and they sound good.  It was also funny and we were laughing throughout the whole show.  All the actors and servers work so hard and definitely made the show enjoyable.  They even stay in character when the lights are on during meal times.  It is semi-interactive and they intermingle through the isles but nothing that would embarrass you.

GhostBusted plays till Feb 9 2013! So goooo get your tickets!

When you arrive at 6:15-6:40, they serve you the soup and salad. Then the play/musical starts. Entrees are served in the first break, and Dessert in the second break.  

Coat check = $2
It is in the same building as \"Aussie Rules\", and they share the same foyer, and bathrooms off the foyer.
I believe there are coupons in the entertainment book which lower the cost from $65, to $50."}
{"text":"Jubilations deserves a star upgrade because of the time and consideration taken to provide some outstanding customer service.

I was treated to a night at Jubilations this week by a client of mine and she has significant dietary restrictions for medical reasons.  A week prior to our reservation, the chef called my client to discuss her needs.  She must have a liquid diet and told the chef to use her imagination.  The night of our reservation, we received top notch treatment.  Our server noted that we were exceptional guests and she would do her best to cater to my client's needs, which she did.  

For those who are familiar with the meal protocol, you know you are served soup, salad, the main course and desert.  The chef tried to emulate the standard meal options for my client via blended items and also made a solid effort to create a respectable presentation.  My client was served soup broth, then blended fruit with a hint of cayenne to replace the salad as starters.  Her main course consisted of three separate hot, blended servings presented in a variety of glasses.  One was pureed carrots, another pureed potatoes and the third was some sort of spicy tomato soup.  Desert was this awesome looking mocha milkshake with a mint leaf.  My client was absolutely beaming with gratitude and we certainly felt exclusive.  I know she doesn't receive treatment like this very often so this evening was very special for her and I was so thrilled to be there.  The staff truly were amazing.

I must add that the food was better than I remember or maybe there have been improvements.  The carrot cake was in fact the best I've ever had.  I was skeptical about how much I'd enjoy the show, as it wouldn't have been my choice.  However, within 20 minutes I was sold and by the end, I thought the show was fantastic, as every show I've seen in the past."}
{"text":"The Jubilations is an interesting bit of home grown musical dinner theatre.  Comprised of a talented group of actor-servers who double as performers and waiters and waitresses, they perform original material musicals as the crowd enjoys a decent meal and drinks.  It's fun, definately amusing and always quite entertaining.

The shows rotate every few months, and very often seem to be inspired with what happens to be the popular zeitgeist of the day, be it a crime show, Glee, rock n' roll and what not.  While admittedly not ready for Broadway, I've found the shows to be original and clever.

Dinner is basically a standard 3 course with a salad, choice of entree and dessert, with beverages and alcoholic drinks extra.  All the while, you have the performers/servers stay in character the entire time, and it's quite cute to watch them interact with the crowd.  I found my prime rib to be excellent, and had no complaints at all.  Most importantly, it was a good balance for the amount of food, just enough to be comfortably full.  

Overall, it's something I look forward to try again, and highly recommend it.  Sometimes Costco offers a discounted event at the Jubilations as well around Xmas time.

{"text":"It was very good... Super funny place!! You laugh since the beginning to the end!! .. The food is ok ... The main thing is to have fun!! Food is just a compliment... So, don't expect the best food in town, but be prepared to have fun and laugh..."}
{"text":"It had probably been a decade since my first visit to Jubilations. My wife and I got some tickets from a friend who couldn't go and we saw the Star Wars show.

The show was great. It was funny, a small amount of interaction from the crowd, and well executed for the size of the room. The food was only ok though. I get that they have to make everything for everyone at the same time and try to feed everyone at the same time, between breaks in the show, but my prime rib was a little on the cool side, despite being served on a warm plate. It was also disappointing to see that they serve the prime rib medium instead of medium-rare like most restaurants. The drinks were delicious though and the pony jug went down fast.

Great job to the cast and crew for a fun show and great service."}
{"text":"Awesome time!!First visit for company Christmas party..had lots of fun with just the right amount of social time in between acts! Saw Buddy Holly show,Even got called up stage which was hilarious!! Thanks \"Cornelius\".will definitely go again with friend and family."}
{"text":"Jubilations really is all around good fun.  It's a great evening for dates, friends and families.

First of all you get a show.  Now, the shows are usually a parody of something... Pirates of the Great Saskatchewan, Best of 'Friends', Thank-You Elvis Presley, etc.  They are always a comedy and always full of laughs.  Not only do the actors and show keep you entertained, but so do the waiters, greeters and announcers.  Everyone is in character and themed to the performance that is going on.  It really is a hoot!

The menu is a little different too.  With each performance change, so does the menu.  You start off with soup, then get a salad and your choice of main course and desert.  They always offer beef, chicken, fish and a vegetarian dish, so there will always be something everyone will like.  The food isn't gourmet-style food, but it's good and fills the hole in your tummy.  Everything is included in the ticket price, with the exception of alcoholic beverages... those cost extra, but aren't too extreme.

The sets and music are always extreme and very elaborate.  I've been astounded each time I've gone at the lengths that Jubilations takes to ensure the atmosphere is up to par.  I love that every worker in the theatre is in character.  It really makes it an enjoyable, and laughable experience.

The productions are always family-friendly so you won't have to worry about exposing children to anything too scarring, but they also have hidden innuendos that only grown-ups will pick up on.  It really is a great time for everyone.

The tickets may be a little expensive, but you're getting three and a half hours of entertainment and food.  It's definitely worth it to check out a show because once you do, you'll want to go back time and time again!"}
