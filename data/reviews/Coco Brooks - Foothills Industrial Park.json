{"text":"Try another location this one wouldn't serve us at 7:45 because they close at 8, I should have driven to the the 32nd one won't be going to this one again"}
{"text":"They have gone down hill in the last year. Pasta a coworker just ordered is DRY and NO sauce and she ordered the chicken fettuccine.  Another coworker ordered the donair calzone and said it was disgusting,  nothing like their description in the menu and they do not use real donair meat."}
{"text":"Regular (wheat crust) and gluten free! Eat in/take out hot or take frozen. So fantastic.  Recommend both eating in and taking home frozen for another time.  For gluten free, Coco Brooks uses Kinnikinnick gluten free crust. Now here's the trick - if you order frozen gluten free pizzas to take home, and they don't come in a foil tray - your server grabbed the wrong ones.   Buy X pizzas, get one free - usually cheese or cinnamon! Celiacs rejoice. Sadly the gluten free cinnamon dessert pizza isn't available for take and make. but you can have it hot right then and there! Who says you can't start with dessert?!   Strawberry banana smoothie is great - my favourite, and I don't really like smoothies! And only $2.75, what a steal! Filled with real fruit, real taste. Cool and refreshing on a hot day. Quick grab when in need of something good for you.   Many creative and tasty flavour pizza combos. I like most everything I can have from their gluten free menu.   Healthy options too.  Sandwiches, salads, carrot sticks & apple slices. Fruit & dessert snacks too.  Even take & bake cookies.   I had an error with my frozen & hot & fresh order, was given the non-gluten free pizzas - which I noticed when I got home, and they resolved it, apologized, and made it right.  I am *always* impressed with their superior level of customer service.  Berni was fantastic.  Very involved in the community, many tasty fundraisers start here.  They are an exemplary corporate and community citizen. I wish more companies would be half as involved as Coco Brooks are, we'd all be better off."}
{"text":"Recently they catered Pinnovate's 1st birthday party and their pizza was so good!  They had cheese, ham and pineapple, turkey pepperoni which is what I will be eating from now on and a BBQ chicken pizza which was also very good.  I like that they are independtly owned and local.  Will definitely be going back :)"}
{"text":"I went in to get a pizza and smoothie at lunch thinking it would be quick. The girl who served me seemed extremely inconvenienced that I was there. I asked for my smoothie and she looked at me as if it was the dumbest question I could ask because they didn't have smoothies although they show advertisements and everything to make me think they did. I then ordered my pizza and when she handed it to me she just shoved it in my hand and walked away without even looking at me.  Wouldn't recommend this place to many people."}
{"text":"Wow, great little pizzas.    Try the Ala mo wana (hawaiian) or the bdc.  mmm...getting hungry for pizza now."}
{"text":"The staff are not very good at answering the phones, almost always put on hold for 5 minutes. They really just seem like none of them give a shit. Pizza is ok, gone a bit downhill in the past year."}
