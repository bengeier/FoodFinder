{"text":"This place is straight out of 1985 in some ways, but that is part of its charm.  The food is decent and the salad bar that comes with every meal is very well equipped, including pepperoni bread.  The house wine goes well with most food, and carafes are inexpensive.  Cleveland-comfort-food -city!  We are starting to make this place a tradition when we are in town visiting family."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in several years. Mainly because the food was not great and it was getting on in the years.   BUT after the remodel and a shake up on the menu. And I believe a change in management. I have been here twice and the Food is much better than you would find in a chain. Wait staff is very at attentive and friendly.  Good for just about any occasion."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and great service. The ciabatta tolls are delicious with the homemade premier sauce. A significant amount of authentic options that are delicious: pasta, shrimp, steak, chicken and ravioli. Can't wait to return with my family."}
{"text":"We live in the Detroit area and met Lori at the Fabulous food show this last November. She talked us into trying the sauces. Being Italian it is rare we like any sauce but our own.  Tried it and loved the Premier brand.  Bought 4 to take home and since I travel to Parma for work I have since bought a case to bring home.  It is great for anything you need pasta sauce for. Lasagna, veal and chicken parm etc."}
{"text":"We catered a family event for 90 people on 12/12/2015 and it went without a hitch. The broasted chicken and roast beef were delicious. The sides (au gratin potatoes and steamed veggies) were also very good.  The salad was plentiful.  And the food arrived on time and was hot.   We wanted to ensure there was enough food so we actually ordered a few more portions, but that was unnecessary.  There would've been more than enough for all, plus.   Everything was great and the value for the dollar was fantastic.  We'd use Stancato's again without reservation."}
{"text":"...We had the pleasure of dining at Stancatco's Saturdays 7 May at about 4:30 PM. My girlfriend & I were surprised how crowed it was already. We were able to get the last table, actually it was a booth, cause they now had a 15 minute wait for those with out reservations.    Once seated our server, McKinsey, explained the specials , their components & how it was prepared. When asked if they had Bruschetta, McKinsey went back to the kitchen to ask if had it. To my surprise they didn't. An Italian Family Restaurant that doesn't have Bruschetta ???  Oh Well    Fortunately we had Very Enjoyable Entree's  My Lady had the Pork Chop with Fontina Cheese wrapped in Prosciutto with Balsamic Glaze. & Au Gratin Potatoes. Pork Chop was HUGE, Tender, Juicy. Cheese melted just right enveloped in crispy prosciutto with that tasty balsamic glaze. The potatoes were moist, very cheesy, & al dente A Definite 5 Out of Five    I had the Chicken Marsala that I was Very Very Impressed with.  My chicken plump, not pounded to Hell, flat. Seasoned well. Appreciate the fresh mushrooms. Had just the right amount of Marsala Wine in the sauce. DELICIOUS My Spaghetti with Garlic & Olive Oil was the best I had in a Very Long Time. I Loved the amount of Garlic in my pasta my girlfriend's eye's were watering. ROOKIE.    ANOTHER 5 Out of FIVE. We were very Pleased with our meal & service. McKinsey did a MARVELOUS Job. We were impressed to hear that she is a recent hire & showed such experience & knowledge of your system & style.    We will be back because of food & device, maybe you will consider adding Bruschetta to the menu."}
{"text":"I absolutely love stancatos ! The staff is so friendly and accommodating . & the food is just to die for . I order here often from The pronto menu & attend many of their special buffets for the holidays . I'm always satisfied and I can't get enough ! I wish I could pick a favorite . From the mussels to the meatballs , to the Alfredo sauce and of course the ciabatta garlic rolls ! Definitely recommend ! Also they have an absolutely amazing Italian buffet every Sunday as well as during the week . And you can always order any or those items from their menu any day of the week. You can either dine in or order out ! Love love love stancatos !"}
{"text":"Excellent service and above excellent food. I had fresh fruit served in my salad and the chicken parm was great!"}
{"text":"I was craving the famous Stancato's salad bar the other day, so I convinced my family to take the drive out to Parma. We knew nothing about the huge renovation project, so we were definitely surprised when we pulled up, but we were reassured by the \"open during renovation\" sign so we went in. One of us made a comment like, \"welcome to Beruit, how may I help you\" as we walked in, hoping that it was just the building's exterior was under renovation.    When we got inside we were saddened to see that the whole dining area, INCLUDING THE SALAD BAR, was gone...gutted and awaiting a complete makeover!  We strolled into the bar area, saw a fun and crowded group, but were about to head out, in search of a full dining experience, when the bartender (who we later found out was the owner) came flying out from behind the bar to clean off a table and welcome us.  I am certain that he has seen initial reactions like ours many times in the recent past, and he knew exactly how to help us! I mentioned that we were looking forward to the salad bar and he assured us that they would make us \"delicious salads\" with our entrees!  He told us that, despite all of the work out front, the kitchen was intact and we'd get the same great food that we loved.  Wow, was he ever right!  Our server was absolutely delightful and the meals were fantastic. The owner had been right about the salads, as they allowed us each to pick from their many great salad choices (mine had strawberries and almonds) to compliment our meals.  Personally, I had been looking forward to the many great breads on the salad bar, so I was overjoyed when our server brought us an abundant tray of delicious heated and seasoned rolls, with a fantastic red sauce for dipping!  We could not have been more satisfied with any part of our dining experience! Even the other servers who ran our food were completely attentive! They filled our drinks and completely pre-bussed our table, instead of just dropping the food and running, as has become so common elsewhere lately.  The entrees (Chicken Scallopine, Lasagna and Ravioli) were fantastic and the portions were large (I just finished my leftovers for lunch!).  We will definitely be back soon, and we highly advise you to give this place a chance during renovation, because they deserve it.  My only regret from that night was that I didn't get a chance to shake the owner's hand and thank him for convincing us to stay!"}
{"text":"My family was at Stancato's on opening day in 1971. Sadly, the food went from good to disappointing over the years, and a lot of people in the area quit going. But I had a gift certificate from them via the Welcome Wagon when I moved back to Cleveland last year, and I was amazed at the amazing dinner I had. Wow! I got the roast pork marsala as a takeout order and split it with my mother. It was so tender, and the sauce was bright and tasty. The seasonal salad was a mix of summertime flavors -- so fresh too. The green beans were cooked just right, still firm and green. I'm not doing the meal justice in my description. Each dish was fresh and flavorful.   Suffice it to say that my family started going to Stancatos again after years of skipping it. I encourage others to give it a try again if they haven't lately."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. I don't often dine i  hut i get carryout quite a bit! I miss the old crew they had working a couple years ago in the carryout, they were a great group of girls, but as they grew up and went on to bigger and better things they have been replaced with a good and friendly crew. The carry out is ready in 10-15 minutes, i never had to wait. Stancatos has the vest pizza in town! The Tuscan spinach and artichoke pizza in particular was amazing! Not only is the pizza great but every entre is fantastic! I strongly recommend the portobello raviolis and the eggplant rustica!  Keep up the good work stancatos! Ill definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place and the buffet is always great.  Great wedding soup, house dressing, and it's really great when they bring out a fresh pizza for the buffet.  Great buffet great family"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Stancato's for your next party or event.We had a family reunion with 75 people and ordered Stancato's.They delivered on time.The food was hot and simply delicious! So many compliments on the chicken paprikash,baked chicken,penne with alfredo,cavatelli with cheese sauce and meatballs!We will definitely use them in the future!"}
{"text":"Went last night with 6 other adults. The atmosphere is lovely and our server was very attentive but not overbearing but I and my parents were disappointed with our meals.  All our meals came with salads. We all had the sunshine salad but for me there was way too much dressing and it did not taste homemade. (I should have asked) I had the eggplant rustica and the eggplant tasted like it had been fried hours before and then reheated. I was given one side. No sauce ( should have read the description more closely) so all in all a boring dish. My Mom had the almond crusted cod which came with one side and the piece of fish was about 4 inches by 2 inches and the flavor was ok. My Dad had a chicken dish with spinach and cheese and he said it was good but a very small portion. To be fair my other friends enjoyed their pork chops and scallops but I won't be back. I will stick with D'Agneses in Broadview Heights."}
{"text":"We had the steak romano--this is perhaps the best steak experience we've had in a restaurant! The Mediterranean house salad was en pointe and the overall experience was superb!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about their service and tasty food. Prior to my visit, I contacted them to find out if they had any gluten-free options as I ha e Celiac. Lori Stancato was quick and thorough with her responses to my concerns, giving me plenty of options to try. I had the Giuseppe Filletto with Autumn Harvest salad and gluten free penne w/ garlic butter sauce. Amazing!! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went for Easter buffet. Was seated in a timely fashion. It was moderately busy for the time of day. Really picked up as time went by. Took a little while for server to come and take drink order. Atmosphere is very nice. We were seated in a large booth for a family of 6 very comfortable and clean.  The buffet had a good selection of dishes. The only vegetables on it were two salads and spinach cream sauce. The ham was sliced off a tube. The baked cod was very good!  All in all, it was good. Would return."}
{"text":"C minus Italian food. Everything is cooked with sub-par ingredients and lots of oil and fat instead of spices and herbs.  If you like greasy TV-dinner quality Italian food this place is for you, but if you like fresh authentic flavorful Italian food steer clear!"}
{"text":"Gross food! 80's decor. Why are people eating at this place?!?"}
{"text":"Great daily lunch buffet for $9.99.  Many items to choose from leaving you overfilled, like their pasta shells.  I've been coming here for 40 years and although I live in Dallas now., when I come back to Big Cle I make time for Stancotto's.  Renovated and nice!   Garlic rolls are good."}
{"text":"Love love love Stancatos. My fiance orders something different each time but I live for the scallops and risotto. Knocked off one star because sometimes the risotto is under but if their consistency improves, I will gladly increase rating!"}
{"text":"After tasting the sauces at the Cleveland Home and Garden Show, a lady at the booth told us to check out their restaurant after the show.  We did!  Had a group of 6.  I have to say it was a very delicious meal.  The waitress was awesome as well as the other staff members.  Made us feel like family.  Our group enjoyed the meal very much.  From salad to the amazing cannoli!  Coming from Catawba Island, it's quite a drive.  But I'm sure we will make the trip back again!!  LOVED IT."}
{"text":"We rented a party room upstairs for a baby shower. We bought catering and accommodations for 45 guest. Only 42 guests actually attended and one guest did not eat.  I asked the one guest that did not eat if they wanted their dinner to go, since we already paid for 45 meals. She said yes. I made a to-go plate for my guest. I also made 3-more to-go plates since we paid for 45 and technically only served 42.  When we paid our final bill we were charged for 45 meals and 4-more meals because we took 4 to-goes. (Total 49 meals) We tried to explain that we paid for 45 and only served 41, entitling us to 4 more meals that are already paid for.  Stancato's response was \"it is an all you can eat buffet and doesn't entitle you to to-go meals\". The manager did not try to understand that we paid for the meals already and only focused on her idea that we were trying to take food we didn't pay for.  Too bad, we paid for 49 meals (only received 45) and unfortunately will never return to Stancato's.   On an appositive, the room was very nice, our two young servers were hustling and the food was good. Parking was close, restrooms were clean and we still wish them well.   They overcharged us $80 and were very arrogant about it. They don't want or need my business. Goodbye."}
{"text":"Do you like Italian food..........Then you must go here.  Had the Lunch Buffet and it was AWESOME.  It was hot it was good and it was a good price.  Keeping this review short and sweet because I am now a fan of Stancato's.    Two Thumbs up and a huge smile from this guy right here!!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried their Pronto Pick Up service for the first time last weekend and was really disappointed.  The experience wasn't completely terrible, but they had set a high bar with their catering service always being flawless.  The order wasn't ready at the requested time.  They forgot one of our items, and we had to drive 30 minutes round trip to go back for it (my kid would have had a meltdown without his promised pizza, so just saying \"forget it\" wasn't really a good option).  They didn't offer to take it off our bill or give us anything extra to make up for their mistake.  There were no napkins or utensils included or offered at pick-up (at least my husband said he didn't see any).    The food was still good, and I think the prices are fair.  The service on the catering side has always been fantastic, so I'll give them another shot."}
{"text":"The clambake is awesome! Excellent choices along with the clams. Atmosphere is great and service was excellent. I will definitely be back to try more excellent food."}
{"text":"I always want to like this place. It's beautiful and comfortable,  just not very tasty. Always have to season the food...... the buffet is a GREAT idea..... but still always hoping it tastes better than it does."}
{"text":"Anyone who lives in the area knows Stancatos. The longevity of their business is a testament to their success. They produce a quality product year after year. The food is always good. They have a wide selection of dishes. We stopped there yesterday for the Sunday buffet. The quality and selection for $14.00 was great. The staff was friendly and prompt.  You just can't go wrong with Stancatos!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Very cozy environment and the food was delicious!   I plan to use the catering services for my daughters baby shower!"}
{"text":"We use Stancatos a lot for work catering. The orders are always correct and on time. Their sheet pizzas are thick and doughy.  I like their house balsamic. I keep a bottle at work.   I guess this one is short and to the point!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We ordered from their off premise catering menu for an event in Aurora. This was for a baby shower for 70 people, so we needed a lot of food. The price per person was perfect, the catering staff was super friendly and easy to talk to on the phone, and everything was delivered piping hot and absolutely as ordered. The food was amazing - their Italian marinated chicken is delicious! And the garlic sticks are amazing! Stancato's is a Cleveland gem."}
{"text":"Discovered this italian restaurant a few months ago and I think it's worth the trip to try out.  Their portions are generous and reasonably priced.  Their bread is delicious and their sauce is the perfect compliment with it.  Calamari is something I recommend and their service is good.  Pasta is cooked very well, though the dishes I've had so far has A LOT of butter/oil.  But maybe that's why it tastes good.  Haven't had any of their deserts but I'll be sure to try it one day."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect. Impeccable service and delicious appetizers and entrees. Don't forget the tiramasu. 1st time visitor, will be back."}
{"text":"Drove an hour for a banquet here so I can't comment on their regular food. The service was great and the food, for banquet food was probably the best I've had. The green beans almondine was hot, flavorful, and crisp/tender. Not the usually mushy veggies you get. The pizza had a nice crust and the sauce was not overly sweet. Again, not the norm. The salad was nothing too out of the ordinary but the veggies were fresh, crisp and not watery. Our chicken Marsala, beef tips and potatoes were also hot and tasty.  Bartender was very friendly. A good time was had by all and I would make that drive again!"}
{"text":"We recently held an anniversary party in one of their banquet rooms.  I cannot express how easy they made this event planning for us.  From the very first phone call through paying the check, they were incredibly nice to work with and so helpful.  I highly recommend them for any event you might have.    Stancato's has been a family favorite for many years.  We continue to have them cater parties and get together's.  Their food is delicious and there is variety of options.  We will continue to use Stancato's for their quality food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Stancatos is the best. My Family Love It I love it the Pizza is always amazing. You can not go wrong eating at Stancatos. Did I mention the prices were super low and the staff was on top of there game. I def recomend people try out Stancatos."}
{"text":"My first clue about this place should have been why is the entire restaurant full of senior citizens on a Tuesday night?  Food was mediocre at best, borderline poor.  Bread/pizza by the salad bar was cold.  Salad bar was good but it's kind of hard to mess that up (in America anyway).  My angel hair pasta dish was kind of gross.  Servers were very cute but I'd take a fat, hairy middle aged server with good food over a pretty young thing that serves crap.  I think I had catering from this place at work back when I lived in CLEvage and I remember it tasting much better..."}
{"text":"My girlfriend went with her family for Easter brunch told me she would not go back due to being misled on the high pricing that did not even include a desert or drink.  The service was terrible with checks so mixed up.  The food was good but not at the cost of over $30 per person with tax and gratuity will they return."}
{"text":"Stancato's is a well-known Italian restaurant and caterer, specializing in Italian classics augmented by many innovative selections, running the gamut from steaks and chops to fish and shellfish creations.  Their plush, Parma location offers comfy booths and roomy tables ideal for leisurely dining, and the adjacent party rooms can accommodate from 20 to 96 guests.   The menu is wide-ranging, with many classic dishes and specialty pizzas. Pasta reigns here, and you can create your own with your choice of five different types of pasta married with six sauce varieties, including vegetarian options.  The menu is so expansive that you could delight in a mere sampling of appetizers, antipasta, or salads.    We have several friends who regularly choose Stancato's to cater family gatherings and celebrations.  The quality and service were exceptional every time.  Highly recommend this longtime favorite."}
{"text":"Stancato's is a Parma staple...it's been around since 1971, serving classic Italian fare. My wife and I dropped our son off at my in-laws and stopped in tonight to enjoy a relaxing kid-free meal and Stancato's delivered.   We arrived around 5:30 and were seated right away and greeted with warm garlic focaccia bread which is to die for and is accompanied by their premier marinara. Our sever Josh showed up shortly after to take our drink orders and answer our questions about items on the menu.   I was in the mood for veal marsala and my wife went with the chicken piccata. $1.99 if you want capers or artichokes with it which IMHO is kind of cheap. But I digress, the meals come with a side salad and you can choose anyone off the menu which is kind of cool. My wife went with the harvest and I opted for the Caesar. The salads were good and definitely above the premixed bagged variety you get at other places. Anyway the food arrived and we were very happy with our meals. The veal in my Marsala was tender and the sauce was a perfect balance of sweet Marsala wine with a hint of salt and plenty of mushrooms. My wife's piccata was cooked perfectly to a nice golden brown and equally delicious. The food coupled with the excellent service really tied the experience together.  We came into this looking for a nice date night and all of our expectations were met or exceeded...thank you Stancato's...you hit it out of the park!"}
{"text":"A new favorite! One of the best places to eat. It had Great service, it was clean, had nice music and was tastefully decorated with black and white photography of Italy. We were served warm and flavorful dinner rolls and a variety of very fresh salad. We ordered the stuffed peppers and the sausage is the best! The stuffed bread, ravioli and linguini were wonderful."}
{"text":"We had reservations for Friday night for Mother's Day.The bread served was hard as a rock. We asked to for soft warm bread and we got it. Following was a fresh salad.   The sausage and pepper pasta dinner barely had sausage or peppers on it.My Dad was dissappointed. The potato encrusted cod was raw.I had two others check to taste it's rawness;It was slimy raw.Stancato's had to recook the fish.Didn't eat the filet after the raw fact, lost  my appetite.  Our dining experience with our waiter and waitresses though  was great.We really appreciate them and their hard workDespite how our  dinner turned out."}
{"text":"Love the Sunday Buffett. Great for family dinner or a special occasion. A bit pricey but great quality food. Wear your stretchy pants to this buffet. Love taking my mom for Mother's Day service is amazing"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with my family. We love your restaurant.  Food is awesome, service is awesome, atmosphere is exactly what i want in an Italian restaurant. Pricing is a little up there but its definetly worth it and you get what you pay for.  I must say last night our server Ben was beyond amazing. He was on top every table he had. Giving top notch service to ever single table. Including 2 that weren't even his. 1 of them was us. He was 1 of the best servers we have ever had. There is no possible way Ben could have made our experience any better he was beyond perfect. That man would make an awesome manager for your establishment in the future. Do not lose that man."}
{"text":"A good restaurant dies a slow death...  THE UP-SIDE:  Way back in the day, I was there as this restaurant opened.  (The Stancato's were neighbors and we would help them when needed.)  At the time - mid-seventies - the place had a much different look and no pretensions what so ever.  Times have changed and so has much of the management.  Given a major facelift in the mid-nineties or so, the place looks a lot different.  Some people prefer this newer look.  Thankfully, the pizza has remained pretty good.  THE DOWN-SIDE:  Along with the newer look and the changing management (the father dying and brothers kicking out brothers, etc) the place began to lose much of its original charm.  In the beginning, the food tasted authentic and the atmosphere felt much the same.  Today, the food tastes just \"okay\" at best, and \"processed\" at worst.  Thankfully, they haven't effed-up the pizza too bad.   In fact, the pizza would be the only real reason to eat at Stancato's.  THE SUM-IT-UP:  Don't go here if you have a choice.  It's not that great.  However, if you're in the area and stuck for a place to go, give it a shot.  Stick with the pizza and you'll be okay.  Just don't go in looking for any \"authentic\" Italian type atmosphere or food - that died years ago, with the Stancato father and the sons that gave a damn."}
{"text":"We always use Stancato's for catering on our commercials and they are fantastic. The staff is always so willing to help with suggestions and orders... plus the food taste great and it's reasonably priced. My favorite go-to Cleveland catering."}
{"text":"When I lived in Cleveland, this was my favorite Italian restaurant. It's locally owned, and they make their own sauce. They were shut down for a while remodeling, and I was having withdrawals. Thankfully, they sell their sauce at the grocery store, so I had a little saving grace. When they did open back up, my fiance and I went, and the remodel was beautiful. The space is larger, and the furnishings are all brand new. Enough about the building, though, let's talk about the food!  Their pizza is out of this world good! I moved to Georgia for the weather, but if I ever return to Cleveland, it will be for Stancato's pizza. When my parents visited Cleveland, we would always go here for the food. Their pasta dishes are pretty good size, and also quite delicious. I have not found this quality of Italian food anywhere else I have lived. I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch on our way to an appointment.  Place was packed, alot of people drinking beer and wine, seemed like a cool atmosphere and nice hostess and waiter.  Both recommended the lunch buffet and since we were in a hurry seemed perfect.  My boyfriend and I took a quick look at it and opted to do the buffet. On a weekday, late lunch, big mistake.  Food was not even warm, Alfredo sauce tasted spoiled, it was very inconsistent.  Some pluses were the stuffed mushrooms, I basically ate those for my lunch, and the salad was decent.  I do know from hearing from a regular while paying out that their Sunday buffet is amazing.  So we will likely give it another shot when we are in the area on a Sunday."}
{"text":"We have been there twice now and have not been dissapointed. Mother's Day buffet was great! We ate in the lounge last Friday and the Italian sausage & peppers that the waiter recommended was delicioso!"}
{"text":"Our family used to always go here for the buffet. Everyone agrees that the food is never hot. It is always just lukewarm, which makes me nervous as far as bacteria etc. and salmonella. I recently went for the lunch buffet to give it another try. They took away the big salad bar, which is a huge loss in my opinion. And again, the food was good but hardly warm. Borderline cold.  We have complained to the waitress in the past and even requested they warm up our plates for us, but this is something I would think is a requirement of all restaurants. To keep the food at the proper and safe temperature at all times.  It is a shame since the food choices are pretty good. CHicken, pasta, pizza, soup, fish (fried and broiled) pirogis, potatoes and vegetables."}
{"text":"For the money stancatos is a very consistent restaurant. I feel that their pizza is their staple.  Try the margarita pizza or the stuffed hot pepper pizza yum!!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge Italian foodie because of all the cheese and carbs, but on occasion I will slip in a known and loved spot to get a little Italian love.  Stepped in here and was first of all, surprised by the Happy Hour...cause y'all know I LOVE SOME HAPPY HOURS, Their menu actually offers a 6 Jumbo shrimp cocktail for $3.00!  Did ya hear that...not $6.00... $3.00! Incredible...where can you get 6 fresh shrimp for .50 each?  They also offer a daily HH deal, the best being... 1/2 off apps 4p-close (Mon only) must be their slow day, 1/2 off small pizza (Tues), Pick 1 of 3 Italian Classics for $9.00 (Wed) and $6.00 Martinis all day Saturday. They also have ever a lounge menu that is a better price than the main dining menu, but it isn't that expensive...moderately priced.  My last tidbit is the Brushetta... is ridiculously yummy.  All it is ... a pizza bread topped with freshly crushed tomatoes, olive oil, garlic and basil...but oh my goodness was it tummy pleasing!  Just don't wear a belt those days..."}
{"text":"Way too many choices on menu.  Since this was a group effort there were a couple different dishes sampled.  of course, being Italian restaurant the parts and sauces are home made.   the pasta dishes come with salad and entrees come with salad and side pasta dish.   the stuffed shells came with simple marinara sauce and meatballs off sausage were an add on item. the shells had nice seasoning with cheese. the gnocchi pepperanata was potato gnocchi, roasted red pepper sauce, and sausage with a couple slivers of zucchini thrown in. really nice dish mid sauce blended well with gnocchi.  eggplant parm was nicely cooked served with marinara sauce and that came wIth side of risotto. Again flavor was good. servings were plenty to take home too.   Only problem is they have coupons is entertainment book and the our town all around books they will not honor a coupon they paid for any more. If you went thru their remodeling with them I hope you used it then. It's not a good thing to drive half hour and they change a $15 coupon to worthless. It seems like a restaurant that overextended itself and can't afford their operations."}
{"text":"Visited Stancato's while in town on business, and was extremely impressed with the atmosphere and homemade Italian food. A great business meeting place. A must visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Stancato's for years. For me, you never know what you are going to get here. My most recent visit I had a lemon chicken dish. When it got to my table it looked like a frozen chicken breast that was defrosted in the microwave then grilled quickly. The chicken was very dry but the pool of lemon \"sauce\" it was swimming in helped that out.   In the past I've been there for the buffett and it was great. I ate a little bit of everything and it was all good. We also order their sheet pizzas and roasted chicken for family parties and it's always great. Other then the bad experience with the lemon chicken off the menu I've always been happy with the place.  They are under construction now which is much needed. We will be there again to check it out when its done."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Jim P's review.  Drove here from Mentor, based on flashy brochure and self promotion.  Soon discovered, as has happened in Little Italy to so many formerly gr8 restaurants, that 3rd and 4th generations usually let things go beyond what those that came b4 them would ever let happen.  We went for the Sunday buffet and found every single item to be barely room temperature.  Even the florentine soup was cold.  The food was not that impressive...I've actually had better at the Olive Garden.  And at  13.99 per person, thought it should be a shade above franchise- type restaurants.  Our waitress was polite, but somewhat aloof.  Asked her if she would check to see if we could get a couple items ala carte to take to our daughter.  She just said no, without ever even asking management.  She apparently wanted to make that decision herself.  We just didn't need side dishes and salads, but no, I guess that was comparable to accomplishing a moon mission, so it didn't happen.  They won't see us again, that's for sure.  Too bad, cause they sure make a nice brochure...."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!! We had plenty to eat from the buffet!  Absolutely would visit here again!"}
{"text":"Had a great hot pepper pizza. Went with my Italian girlfriend and mother, they said it's their favorite place to eat their native food & they \"are always here\". Service was good, had enough food for leftover lunch tomorrow. Good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We used Stancato's catering for a party we had at our home.  Everything was perfect.  The order was accurate and ready on time.  The penne pasta with red sauce and the chicken tenders were a big hit.  People were asking about where they can buy the food. Customer service was good too, everyone was super nice and efficient.   We will definately use Stancato's for any future parties."}
{"text":"I went to stancatos for my birthday last night and the food was delicious and everything was perfect. They have the best fish fry ever! They also sang to me and gave me ice cream and gave me a free bottle of sauce for my birthday which was super nice of them. :)"}
{"text":"Was just there recently for the first time and we had a private room upstairs for a work dinner. They served chicken parm that was the best I've had in a restaurant. Also, the rolls they gave us were outstanding! The only downside was the bar area upstairs. I knew it was \"cash only\" and that we'd have to buy our own drinks for this dinner...but it really was CASH ONLY, meaning no credit cards. I thought that was pretty strange. Hubby & I ended up walking back gown to order our drinks at the main bar so we could use our card."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I feel about my first experience at Stancato's.  I've been wanting to visit for many years it's just a little out of the way.  So I finally made it there with a friend for a late lunch.  We were seated promptly and our server greeted us quickly.  Our drinks were always filled and the food was good.  But overall the whole experience was- for lack of a better word- weird.  We felt rushed and unwelcome from the start.  Almost like the attentive service was a bid to get us on our way even though we said we were in no hurry, just a couple of regular suburbanite women out to lunch on our day off.  The salad was served quickly after ordering and it was beautiful and delicious but it wasn't 3 minutes later the server came and said our meals would be out in a moment.  I was barely half finished with the salad at that point.  As promised, the main dishes were served about 30 seconds later and I had to push my half eaten salad to the side.  My ravioli dish was tasty but only lukewarm.  It was edible so I didn't complain but it also should not have been served at that temperature.  Again, it was only a very short time after being served our meal the server came back at regular intervals of 3 minutes to ask if we needed anything and if we were ready for our dishes to be taken... while we had barely set the fork down!  It felt very rushed and unwelcoming.  I made the mistake of asking for dessert and he read the list so quickly with no descriptions of the items that I honestly had to idea what the items were and had to ask him to repeat them, which he did in the same manner.  I finally settled on something and asked if it was cake or ice cream (read as \"chocolate mocha\").  He said cake... I was disappointed upon it's arrival that it was not cake but cheesecake.   Anyway, I'm not sure what the issue was as it was not crowded nor did they inform us that they closed at a certain time after lunch hours.  It certainly is not listed that way on the door or website.  Eventually the manager came to ask us to leave because they needed to make way for the dinner crowd- It was 230pm!  I'm not sure I'm willing to give it a second chance just because for the price you pay a customer should not only get good food but also a great experience."}
{"text":"I would like to like Stancato's more.  It seems to have a good following of patrons.  Decent atmosphere. Pretty good Salad/soup bar.  Dinner/Entrée-wise Nothing really overwhelms me here.  Cuisine usually tastes like it is heated up frozen entrees.  I think for me to like it more the food quality really needs to improve.  Good location close to where I live, but my palate is left wanting more.  I've eaten here both as a meat eater and aspiring vegetarian.  Nothing really jumps out.  I will say I have had the Sunday buffet once...the buffett food did seem to be better than the menu entree items.  I wish both left me satisfied."}
{"text":"Have been here twice in the last few months. We used to come for the Sunday buffet only, but the last two times we have ordered off the menu. Best Eggplant Parm I have ever had. If you are lucky enough to have Trent as your waiter, then your service will be excellent too. We had him once and did not the next time and it wasn't the same.  Nice atmosphere, good food"}
{"text":"I love Stancoto's. I've grown up eating at the restaurant and taking out their pizza. The upgrades to the restaurant are beautiful and it really helped them improve the overall feel to the restaurant. Lately we have been disappointed with the carry out service. They are taking upwards of 3-5 minutes to answer the phone. The phone line says \"your call is being transferred\" and it will just ring and ring. A few times I have waited so long I have just given up. They need to improve this service. That being said, the pizza never disappoints and the bar menu is such a great bargain. Hoping they can improve their takeout service soon."}
{"text":"Great buffet. Friendly staff. Very gluten free accommodating.   Went here today and had the buffet. It was really yummy and had a ton of options. Upon asking the server if it had anything gluten free he went in back and came back with a whole list of things for me that I could and could not have. He even informed me that I could do the buffet and request a side of gluten free pasta to use with the sauces and such in the buffet. They had a lot of gf options on the menu as well including pasta and I believe I even saw pizza on there.  The interior was really nice as well. Great atmosphere for a family outing.   Not a single drawback I could find.   Overall, this was one of my favorite Sunday lunches in a while."}
{"text":"I don't know how exactly I can put into words how amazing our experience was here. From the second we sat down, Ben was our waiter and was so welcoming and friendly. We ordered drinks and an app straight away and they came so quickly! It wasn't 5 minutes before our app came out. We had the calamari dressed in a Basil cream sauce. They had to be using the most fresh basil because we didn't even need that marinara sauce, it was perfect without!  Salads and dinner followed at the most perfect timing. He had the tasty Tuesday and I the almond cod-- my goodness- not a ounce was wasted-- the entire meal was impeccable. Full of flavor, perfect proportions and reasonable prices. But I must say our waiter Ben made the experience. He was so kind and efficient- didn't overly bother us- came around at just the right times- available without overbearing. Good service goes such a long way these days. I can't understand how anyone could say anything negative about this place. We truly cannot wait to return and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I was here last and the place has changed for the worse. The rolls are good but the rest was not good. I ordered chicken parmigiana. It was just fair. The risotto was inedible. The rice was so over cooked you couldn't tell there was rice in it. It was all mushy. My wife got a steak and it was so undercooked we had to send it back. The salad had sugared almonds that had way too much sugar on them. The food took more than 30 minutes to come out. I won't  be back."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. A very friendly welcoming place to have a delicious yet reasonably priced Italian dinner. A beautiful, peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. We enjoyed perfect service from Leslie and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Locally owned and operated exquisite, authentic Italian cuisine. And above all else remarkable hospitality!  We stopped in last night and enjoyed our time in the bar area, service was top notch and fast.  I devoured the Portobello Mushroom Ravioli in white Cream Sauce and a side of Calamari  I have been here a few times.  I make it a destination stop when I am doing business in the Cleveland Area.  I would probably weigh in over 500 lbs if I lived near by.    When I spend my hard earned dollars in this restaurant  I gain more than just satisfying my hunger. I leave having experienced authentic flavors, warm sincere hospitality and an honest sense of gratitude from the entire staff.  I also love the fact that when I was done with my meal, the owner stopped by our table, greeted us and asked how everything was and if he could get us anything else.....Now that is truly amazing and hard to come by."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the chicken parm and friendly service. I heard they are remodeling since my visit which was some time ago. Putting this on my list to check out again!"}
{"text":"My grandparents really like this place so I've come here a few times with them. I have to say, it's not really the best place I've eaten Italian but it's A-OK in my book. The lunch buffet is good and a pretty good deal. There's a salad bar with pizza and another buffet with pasta (6 different pasta sauces), chicken, veggies, all kinds of choices. On Friday's they have pierogies which I'm a huge fan of.  We also came here one year for Thanksgiving dinner. Most of our family wasn't going to be home for Thanksgiving and my mom didn't feel like cooking so we came here for the buffet. It was actually really good, we all left stuffed.. I told my mom she should roll me outta there, ha ha.   Anyways, don't come here expecting a gourmet meal. The food is good but not awesome. Their salad dressings however, are awesome. So if you're looking for a place to eat lunch with coworkers one day, Stancato's is cheap, has variety and will satisfy your pasta craving."}
{"text":"Me and the wife hit thr lunch buffet, 5 or 6 times a year.  It is always good.  We love the variety of salads.  They have raised the price a little bit but 2 people can eat well for 25 bucks."}
{"text":"While I've never actually eaten at the restaurant I have gotten take-out quite often! To me, the pizza isn't anything outstanding, but it's decent and I've never had a bad pie.  The reason I gave Stancato's four stars is because they have recently started selling gluten free pizza! Anyone who is on a gluten-free diet knows how difficult it is to find good Italian take-out anywhere in the area. It's great that there is now another place that we can go to for some pizza! I was pretty impressed with the pizza and would definitely try it again! The only suggestion I would have is to make sure they cook your pizza a little bit longer because the rice crust can tend to be soggy, which is pretty typical for this type of pizza.   I would definitely recommend Stancato's gluten-free pizza to anyone living a gluten-free lifestyle!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal or bad service ever! Perry the owner does a excellent job keeping it authentic Italian. Reasonable prices and a great atmosphere. Perfect for any occasion: a business meeting, a date, a birthday, or just an appetizer and a drink."}
{"text":"Growing up in Parma, we frequented Stancato's often.  Most of the time eating from the buffet, which from my memory was pretty good. It's been some time since I've been here and we are considering them for our off site catering needs for our upcoming wedding so thought it would be a good idea to check things out.  We went on a Tuesday night and decided to sit in the lounge. The bar was completely crowded, which from our perception seemed like a very local group, it reminded us of the feeling we have at our go to spot, so we felt comfortable right away. We sat at a high top table in the lounge and immediately were greeted by our waiter, Ben!  Let me just say, even if the food was terrible, he made the experience five stars! The food was very tasty though! We ordered very small, just a bowl of cavatelli with a meatball, again we were just trying to get an idea of their cooking. Ben brought us out hot garlic rolls which were delicious and even replenished them once we devoured them. The pasta was cooked well, the sauce was up to par to me, an Italian girl who can cook a good sauce and the meatball was okay. Throughout the whole small meal, we had a few drinks and Ben never had us waiting or wondering where he was. He was on point, polite and just all around one of the best servers we've ever come across. We spoke briefly to him about our wedding and he surprised us with a bowl of Spumoni to finish our meal. It was chocolate, cherry and pistachio and they were fabulous! We will absolutely return, one for the top notch service and two to give some other dishes a try!"}
{"text":"This review may not be fair as we had the food catered, and did not dine in.  We had a sausage lasagna, sheet pizza, wings, roasted chicken and some salads.  The lasagna was ok, nothing above average.  I've had much better and I am a lasagna lover.  The pizza was heavy on the sauce and hardly had any cheese.  Again, I've had better.  The chicken was pretty good.  Based solely on this experience (which was my only time having their food) I would not order from here again nor go there."}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy Stancatos. I always root for local businesses. The restaurant decor is absolutely adorable. It looks recently renovated and is warm and inviting. Our server Matt was phenomenal-polite, attentive and knowledgeable. We began our meals by sharing an appetizer-stuffed mushrooms. The sausage was the right amount of spicy and the dish was delicious.  The salad course was ok, something you could have at any restaurant. I ordered chicken parmesan.  While my chicken was ok, it was nothing to write home about. I ordered fettuccine alfredo as my side dish and I thought it was terrible. The taste was odd and I only ate 2 bites. I did really enjoy my tiramisu dessert but I'm sure it was not homemade. I do want to add that I appreciated the Yelp coupon that gave me $10 off an order of $40 or more!  Overall, I was very disappointed with Stancatos and don't anticipate going again any time soon!"}
{"text":"Being newer to the area I had never been to, heard of or used Stancatos prior to this experience. Knowing I would soon be hosting my partners 40th birthday party and not wanting to spend it in the kitchen I decided to have it catered so I let my fingers do the internet searching. I found Stancatos online after an exhaustive search for local caterers and decided on them based on five factors 1. wide variety of food choices 2. prices 3. local family owned business 4. delivery option and 5. access to all of their information on the internet.    My breakdown: 1. Food Choices:  They had everything I was looking for in a summer BBQ.  Ribs, chicken, corn on the cob, cole slaw and a nice salad.  Everyone at the party RAVED about the food.  Everything was amazing! The crowd was partial to the ribs, chicken and especially the baked beans.  Truly, I have never had better baked beans...smokey, thick, juicy..perfect!  2.  Price: I am convinced I could not have spent less for 17 people by buying the groceries myself for this meal...plus I would have missed the party altogether from being stuck in the kitchen.  Tray after tray after tray! Leftovers for the next day and more in the freezer. 3. Locally owned/operated: Needs little explanation, I think.  I always prefer local anything. 4. Delivery: For a little extra they deliver everything.  My delivery time was 2:30pm and they were here at 2:28pm!!  Simple drop off and the guests could begin eating! 5. www.stancatos.com :   EVERYTHING you need to know, do, etc.  Other companies lost my business from the start because they didn't even have a website.  From start to finish using Stancatos was easy, the staff extremely friendly and the food was better than my guests and I could have hoped for.  Most importantly, the birthday girl loved her party and her day and was impressed that I had it catered and that the food was so awesome!  Thanks Stancatos.  You really took the stress out of my prep and provided pure joy to everyone here."}
{"text":"Visited this location for a baby shower and I was pretty impressed. I didn't know this place even existed before having to attend an event here. Upon walking in, I was greeted by a hostess which pointed me in the right direction. Up the stairs, and second event room to the right. The room was fairly large with a large round table in the front for gifts and then an even bigger oval table for the guests.   The decor in the event room was nice but a little dated. I liked that there was a separate bar area. The food was good, I would return only for the salad and bread. You can't really mess up green beans or potatoes. The roast beef was ok, a little under cooked and the chicken was good.   The event went smoothly however I thought it was a little tacky when the server went up to the event host and told her that she needs to get moving on the evening because she only had the room reserved for 2 hours. I understand that the server needed to make the host aware but she could have done it in a more private manner. Also, when the bill came it was a little tacky how it was handled.   All in all, it was a great event. I would return for dinner and possibly even have an event here. However I would make it noted that I would not want the server to make such comments in front of my guests."}
{"text":"We went to Stancato's for dinner last night and we had a great time!  We did a fundraiser with Stancato's where they donated a portion of our meal proceeds to charity.    I started off with a Killians beer, my wife had a glass of white wine, and the kids had water. We were accompanied by my cousin and her boyfriend as well. The waitress was excellent! She was friendly and very attentive - perfect!   The food was also great. I ordered chicken Scallopini as I have never tried this dish before. It was two chicken breasts sautéed with peppers, mushrooms and onions. It's simmered with a premier and Marsala sauce blend. The chicken was tender. I could cut through my chicken with a fork! It was excellent! I loved every bite of it and I didn't have any left to take home. It was that good! My meal included a large salad and unlimited bread, which were also good. I ordered a side of steamed broccoli, which had just a tad too much salt.  My daughter had chicken Alfredo, which was tasty. My cousin had chicken Piccata, which is lightly battered, sautéed chicken topped with lemon wine sauce. She opted for capers for $1.50 more. I tasted it, but the whole white wine and lemon sauce flavor isn't my thing. It was good, but I like Marsala, mushroom, and earthy flavors better.  The meal, conversation, service, and overall experience were excellent. We will be back for more when we're in the mood for Italian."}
{"text":"I have been back to Staccatos since they have reopened and the service has been great every time. I absolutely love the food. Our server Trent was the bomb the last time we were in; he was a younger guy and had a great sense of humor and made our experience great when we were in. I ahve sat in the bar, outside on the patio, and the dining area and all are great experiences. Can't go wrong with the genoviese gnochhi or spaghetti and meatballs. :)"}
{"text":"Been frequenting this place since the 70's--has been a family treasure. Beautiful remodel job recently--Tuscan decor though still contemporary in design.  But, please update the World War II music. Yes, Sinatra is always great, but the Lennon Sisters and Bomb group music is so dated it could drive away customers, unless you're the Senior Citizen plus group.  The Sunday buffet is unfortunately more limited than it used to be. The fantastic salad bar is now gone and replaced by one wilted overdressed salad. Buffet table is smaller, fewer choices, and, today, every meat (chicken, pork) and seafood (baked cod) was dry and overdone.  Pizza and pasta sauces still delicious, thank goodness.  Ten dollar glass of Pinot Noir was very good, but small pour looked to be about only 3 oz.  Ginger ale: flat, flat, flat.  Hope the food and drink soon improves as did already the design."}
{"text":"I love their catering menu and food!   We order it at work all the time.  The chicken parmigiana sandwich, cavatelli pasta and salad with pecans is so good!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. They cattor too. They got 3 party rooms for special occasions. Great food. Above average service. Long love staccato"}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed all of the changes Stancato's has made over the last couple of years.   The menu has plenty of selections and all have been delicious.   Try the Autumn Harvest salad with your dinner!   So good!   Also,  ordering food for catering was super easy online.  They called back to confirm my order quickly, they had it ready to pick up on time the next day,  and even called me the following day to make sure everything went well.  Everyone enjoyed the food at my dinner party.   Their meatballs, green beans with almonds and penne pasta were a big hit.   And everyone loved the huge bowl of Autumn Harvest salad.   Have I mentioned that salad is tasty?  ;)  Great job,  Stancato's.   We'll continue to visit!"}
{"text":"I called in a catering order for a holiday party. The food was delivered on time by a very courteous lady. It was hot and well prepared. Delicious. I will definitely be using them for future events."}
{"text":"I have been treated to numerous corporate catered lunches from Stancato's throughout the years. I would always wait until the tables cleared out and vulture on any remaining pieces of food to bring home. I was especially fond of their own bottled Italian dressing which I would save for my lame salads made at home. Last week a coworker suggested we head to Stancato's for the lunch buffet. It was outstanding. Salad, pizza, meatballs, sausage, potatoes, pasta, beef pot roast, chicken breast and a breaded chicken dish were all things that I ate. I felt unstoppable that day. Do not miss the lunch buffet. It is better than Kumo down the way."}
{"text":"For the Easter buffet a large group of family went to Stancatos, especially for the good price. The tables were tight, difficult to get out of some seats.the waitress was a bit overwhelmed, there should have been extra help to remove dirty dishes, and to check on refills( which were not included in price).           About the food, it was wonderful! Fresh plates of 2 different salads, the new full plates came out before old ones were empty. They were so fresh! Wedding soup, was good, the fish was so good, not overlooked. Nice thick pieces, no fishy smell at all. Ravioli was just a little overdone, but it is difficult to keep hot at buffet. That just happens. They also had ham, different pastas and sauces. The buffet was constantly being being wiped clean. Have been going to Stancatos for many years. Have never had a bad meal! They are consistently good. We don't live in Parma anymore, but this place is so worth the trip."}
{"text":"Best family holiday dinner ever .The buffet was amazing well stocked and cleanest buffet ever. Never ran out of anything ( and place was packed) not a drop of anything out of place !! I loved the pizza, Italian pot roast, roasted root vegetables, cheese potatoes,sausage and peppers and pasta with Alfredo sauce. Our server brought out some warm crusty  garlic rolls that were divine . The rest of our table ordered off the menu that offered a nice variety and service was quick. We wish we saved room for desert lol!! Only negative was the salad in the buffet had nuts in it so I was not able to enjoy salad with my meal but trust me that alone does not stop me from a 5 star review. Our server was prompt polite and attentive and did a great job taking good care of us. I have eaten here many times over the past 20 years and held special family parties etc...this time I and was in town for the holidays my first visit since I moved away  ...There were 9 of us and it was seriously best meal I've ever had here and I love the remodel . I plan to visit again next time I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"The staff was very accomodating got the buffett ready fast so we could get to meeting food was delicous"}
{"text":"Their food in general is -ok-. But when i come into town, the first place i want to go for lunch is the Stancatos lunch buffet. They have everything! A great salad bar (yummy house dressing), (2) types of Delicious soups, pizzas breads, and many~many choices of entrees. You will not be disappointed if you go to their lunch buffet! If you go for a dinner, you may be disappointed from their high prices and not so friendly service."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was good. Appetizers pretty over priced. Not really worth it. $9 for 2 planks of fried mozzarella? $9 for 3 long skinny peppers partially stuffed with sausage? Pass. Fill up on the delicious fresh baked rolls.Loved the harvest salad. The Alfredo sauce was good. Risotto was creamy and tasty, great texture. My son loved his Italian pork chop but complained a bit about it being little salty. chicken parmigiana was great! Crispy and flat to perfection. Great place. I'm sure we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch unaware of the buffet.  $10.99 for the buffet plus $2.75 for a beverage which always amazes me since you can get an entire 2 ltr. Bottle for a buck.....but it is the going price.  The food, to me, was just that....food.  I'd say mediocre at best.  Nothing tremendous or that would stand out.  The pork and gnocchi was quite unpleasant to look at.  It was kind of shredded and all mixed together and reminded me of a hairball to be honest.  I felt the food was over salted.  I want to taste food...not salt.  Probably won't hurry to go back, but that's just me."}
{"text":"Went in to try this place out at 8 pm on a Saturday.  No cars in the parking lot, nobody to greet us when we walked in.  The place seemed deserted. Mourned around and left. Very weird."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food buffet.  Amazing and delicious choices.  Loved the pizza, soup and salad bars--the crab bisque was the best with chucks of meat.  Also, fried fish. Large friendly place.  Good service.  Tiramisu dessert was the best I've ever had.  Recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times while traveling in to see family. I've had the lunch buffet, the gnocci dinner, and a holiday buffet and each time was just delightful. The food has always been full of flavor, fulling and overall a good experience."}
{"text":"We have been loyal customers to Stancato's for years.  Not because the food is especially gourmet, but because it's pretty neutral, tastes decent and can feed a large group. We typically utilized it for backyard parties when we know our guests would get drunk enough to appreciate the overwhelming amount of grease and lard in the pizza and wings.    We placed a large order for delivery this past Sunday for my niece's baptism.  After time elapsed beyond the scheduled delivery, we called and inquired as to where the food was.  We were told that our order was in fact put down for pick-up.  This wasn't really a surprise, because we made multiple confirmation calls that were not returned.  An hour later, the food was begrudgingly delivered by the archetypical awkward teen who wanted nothing to do with customer service.  Hey buddy, you're the vanguard of your company right now, show some couth.  A conversation with LORI STANCATO herself yielded the blame being placed on my sister and telling her that our order wasn't important enough to be delivered on time and that people should \"expect to wait.\"  She belittled the guests, accused my sister (7 months pregnant - don't F with that) of lying about what time the food got there, and blamed her for the mistake about the delivery.  My sister didn't sign the credit card slip and they charged her card ANYWAY.  WTF?!  What kind of militant state does Stancato's live in that they think they are above authority?  Total ego.    This woman is a miscreant and a terrible business owner.  The inept clueless high school dropouts running the counter are completely useless.  The food is marginal at best.  Take your business elsewhere.  If I could personally see to the failure of this place, I would readily subscribe to a life of sadism."}
