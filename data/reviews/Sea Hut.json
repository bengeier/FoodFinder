{"text":"We are visiting family from Virginia, and found this great place in Monroe. I ordered the Catfish, and it was delicious. Try it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Can't believe we just FOUND the Sea Hut (we live only a mile away).  We stopped in for lunch today.  Crab cake sandwich was the best I ever had and my husband said his fried oyster sandwich was to die for.  Rosie and Anthony are so friendly, you felt like a regular!   We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Sea Hut is one of the best kept secrets in the Charlotte & Monroe, NC area! Chef Anthony & Mrs Rose are some good people. I don't know where to start because everything is delicious, from the catfish, to the croaker, to the crab cakes, even all the way down to the fried okra and hush puppies!!! Oh and the fried cheesecake and strawberry pie will make you hurt yourself! You will not be disappointed, so do yourself a favor and get by Sea Hut! Peace"}
{"text":"I went to lunch here with my son and teen grandchildren. It was my first visit but definitely won't be my last.   We had the black bass, flounder and porgies between us and granddaughter had the wings. I hated for the meal to end. I have to say it was the best. And those hushpuppies !  They came out looking like onion rings. Sweet and crunchy as if cornbread met funnel cake and produced an offspring.   So bummed we didn't take pictures to post because you would head on over there as soon as you saw them. But don't fret, I'll be sure to snap a few my next visit.   The waitress was the best I've ever had. She explained everything and was very attentive without being that type that interrupts your meal and conversation. Friendly yet very down to business. Loved it!    It had been a long time since I had black bass. It was crunchy, delicious and super fresh.   I hope to get back there before I leave town. I visit Charlotte regularly so I'll be working my way through the menu if I can ever not order the black bass."}
{"text":"Rose and Chef Anthony are good people. Their friendliness and good conversation was delightful. Very warm and welcoming. We were supper excited for the clam strips and we weren't disappointed! Also, we ordered the crab cakes and fried oysters which were also quite delicious. We bought a gallon their homemade drink the \"Uptown\", which is unsweetened  tea and lemonade mixed. Some would call it the Arnold Palmer but I like the \"Uptown\" much better . We will definitely frequent the Sea Hut!! Oh yeah!!"}
{"text":"The Bassa and hush puppies are wonderful! Take out is great but eat in for the great R&B music. Plus, the owner is the nicest man you will ever meet!  Don't let the exterior fool you, there is amazing seafood waiting just inside the door.  Everyone knows that the south is famous for deep fat frying, but the owner of the Sea Hut has it down to a science.  This is a must-try for anyone who loves southern fried sea food.  Take out is available, but if you can eat in its worth it if Anthony has the tunes going!"}
{"text":"A little gem in downtown Monroe. The food and service were excellent.  We had the fried shrimp plate and broiled scallop plate. Both meals were fresh and cooked to perfection.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Best seafood restaurant!!!! Hands down the best! Food is delicious and fresh, everything is fried to order. The owners are the employees, so you get an excellent customer service, the owners are very friendly,  they take the time to explain and answer every questions you have. I will be coming back soon!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"It's okay. You'd expect food to be greasy from a little hole in the wall, but this was all just *extra* greasy. The flavor was fine, pretty bland. Im not sure that the onion rings had real onion in them - just all breading."}
{"text":"Seafood is great! Love the basa! Chicken wings remind me of home ;-)"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner from the Sea Hut & I don't even know where to begin because EVERYTHING was perfect!  We ordered the double fried combo with jumbo shrimp, basa fish (first time I've ever even heard of it & it was AMAZING), french fries, fried okra, & an extra side of Lou's spicy slaw.  The portions were generous & the food was fried crispy to perfection . Even the sweet tea here is done right, just the right amount of sweet!  The owner took our order and was so funny & friendly, the entire atmosphere was very comfy & inviting.  If you are in the area this is IT, very affordable, quality, made to order food!   (P.S.-- if you're a sanitation score freak like myself, you'll be pleased to know they have a very high score )"}
{"text":"Food was great! Home cooked seafood and sides that were great. The owner was a super nice guy who even made a crab cake sandwich for me and it wasn't a menu item. The foods good, but we would go back just because the owner is such a great guy. You don't find many business owners who take so much pride in their food, business and hang out and chat with customers anymore. Highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner, we had three shrimp plates and a chicken wing plate. All were fresh, served hot and very tasty!  Best fried shrimp I've had in awhile. Country restaurant, dishes served on disposable plates, and limited seating available."}
{"text":"Wonderful, friendly atmosphere!!  Best hush puppies ever!  Great food and made to order!"}
{"text":"Fried shrimp was delicious!  Perfectly battered and fried.  Owners are supremely welcoming and nice.  So many options.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Been passing this place for years and after reading reviews decided to give it a try. Boy are we glad we did. The personable service was great. The sanitation grade was excellent (I always look at that). And the food was outstanding. Never had Basa before but after Rosey talked us into it We don't think I will ever eat flounder again. The portion size was very generous. The hush puppies are wonderful.  Both owners are serving and make you feel very welcome and appreciated as customers. We WILL be back. Have a feeling we will be on first name basis before to long.  If you ever find yourself in Monroe this is a definant must."}
{"text":"Was visiting relatives in area & my Dad mentioned he wondered how this place was. Instead of playing the \"I don't care, what do you want to eat\" game, we decided to give it a shot. Grateful we did. Had some of the best fried flounder ever. Wasn't over cooked, tasted fresh & wasn't greasy like some places. Just simple good flounder the way it should be. Service made us feel like we were visiting friends for dinner. Hoping to visit again soon."}
{"text":"We stopped here after leaving Treehouse Vineyards and omg! The food was so fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this place if you're a seafood lover. The owners are so sweet and definitely give you that southern hospitality."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came to visit Sea Hut after the Stone Table was unable to serve us.  It couldn't have been a better reason to stop by this quaint Seafood Giant.  The owners are amazing and the food was EVEN BETTER! My fiancé had the shrimp and grit s and a pound of crab legs and I had the Crab cake sandwich.  The prices were great and we loved the atmosphere.  Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Searched Yelp for a place to eat nearby and found the Fish Hut. Had great reviews and lots of them so we gave it a try. 1st impression? Smelled really clean. Not even a hint of fish. In fact, if you told all they served was lemon, I would've believed you! The food was great. Def recommend the Basa!! The owner is a doll. Very helpful selecting the right type of fish. I'm going to try the gator next time. We'll back for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to get some good fried seafood cooked to your liking...and Anthony is the best ever."}
{"text":"Great little gem in Monroe. Amazingly friendly. Huge portions and some of the best fried shrimp I have ever had. Disappointed that they were out of oysters but still an enjoyable meal big portions low price."}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service but their blue crabs doing the prime season were not good. They really need to have a conversation with their supplier. I was truly disappointed about not being able to eat the crab but wasting money. I gave a 3 because the customer service is wonderful."}
{"text":"Super nice people and fantastic food. That's a combination that's hard to beat. It was my first time trying Basa fish..I'll order that again. Chef Anthony prepared the fried oysters perfectly. Not over cooked or too much breading. Loved them. My wife had shrimp and croaker and said it was great. Hard to beat this place. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review to lower a star. The food is great, but the lady at the front counter is consistently rude to myself and my friends. I sensed a bit a rudeness the first time I ordered over the phone- I asked what were the mixed vegetables and she replied, \"ma'am its a mixture of vegetables\" I brushed it off. But the last time I ate there I was with 2 friends, we ate there and while we were talking (and not too loud) she proceeded to turn the volume on the tv all of the way up. We each looked at each other in confusion, we could not hear the each other talk from across the table. Things like this have happened often when I eat here and my friends said they get the same response. I would imagine it would begin to effect business."}
{"text":"Chef Anthony will spend 20 minutes telling you about their menu, which is large. There are always unique specials like 'gator tail or Argentinian Pink Shrimp. Freshly made to order so don't expect it to be a quick flash fry. Everything is made with love and attention to detail."}
{"text":"Great place and great people. I ordered the fried shrimp. I simply love seeing these types of businesses thrive. This couple take a great pride in their business and their food. The place is very clean and the food is good. My first time in there they took the time to explain the menu. They are very nice humble people and I will continue to patronize their business."}
