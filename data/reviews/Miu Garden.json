{"text":"This place is ridiculous. We reserved a table for 7pm but we didn't get our table until an hour later. The service is terrible and the food tasted so-so."}
{"text":"Went here for dim sum on a Wednesday. It's one of the few places that still use push carts but it's mostly food that doesn't need to be made fresh (like desserts and deep fried stuff).   The food was really average. However, we did get the green onion pancake and that was awful. I think they made it with cornstarch and not flour because it was very smooth and hard...  The service was okay for the food we ordered, but we ordered some cheung fun to go and it took them like an hour to make it! It was literally one order of beef cheung fun! And the employee kept brushing us off whenever we asked her if it was done.   Also, the push cart ladies were pretty pushy with the food and there was one employee who specifically went around to each table, trying to sell dried seafood products..."}
{"text":"Old school Dim Sum cart charms aside we were expecting higher quality food than can be found in your typical Dundas & Spadina area Dim Sum restaurants but it was not even on par with those and some dishes were downright awful tasting. The restaurant itself is worn out and dirty. There are many better DS restaurants in Markham IMO.  We won't be visiting ever again."}
{"text":"Came for dim sum at noon on a Sunday and surprisingly I didn't have to wait in line!  This is the first dim sum place that I have seen where they provide both push carts and give you a piece of paper to write down what you want, interesting.  We ended up ordering most things from push carts until we wanted to finish up with things that we didn't see and ordered off the paper menu.  Service was good, people took our plates in a timely manner and our pots of tea/hot water were filled up quickly.  Do note that they do push their dim sum on you, but be firm when you say no and you are good to go.  The pricing is all sizes for one price.  The rate changes depending on what time you arrive, I think it was 7-9, 9-11, 11-1 were all increasing in prices but I forget offhand by how much.  I wouldn't go out of the way to come here, but it is a good option if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but totally covered in sauces which have way too much cornstarch.  Food is very hard to eat with the thick sauces.  Its very very loud because of the low ceilings.  The decor and furniture are still the same from decades ago. Not sure why there was a line up for this place."}
{"text":"Well, the SO used to visit this location in market village years ago with his family. It was something else at the time. We decided to check out Miu Garden for Saturday afternoon dimsum.  First off, it was packed. Like PACKED. But we managed to score a less than desirable spot in a back corner. We had to franticly flag down the (adorable) cart ladies, to grab some eats. They didn't speak English so we just took what we thought looked good. Food overall was ok, but nothing special. Really greasy.   Other than the cart ladies, the service was sketchy. We fealt REALLY uncomfortable the entire time, there was a strange vibe. I was the only non-asian in the place, sure.. but we were getting what felt like too many strange looks. Not worth it for the mediocre food.   Not a fan, won' t return."}
{"text":"A few of my friends have been raving about Miu Garden for dim sum, but I only just had the chance to experience it this past Saturday.  My only regret - not having discovered it sooner!  We got there around 1:30 p.m. which means each dim sum plate is only $2.30 (it's even cheaper on weekdays).  The restaurant was bustling with activity by the push-cart ladies.  Starving, and with much anticipation, we ordered our usual dim sum fare, and all the dishes indeed were delicious.   Particularly exceptional dishes were:  the tripe (possibly the best tripe I've had in a dim sum place) chicken feet tofu dessert congee curry cuttle fish  We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here and were astonished (in a good way) by the bill.  thumbs up by our group of 5."}
{"text":"Wow. All the food was excellent at the wedding I went to yesterday. Service was fast and somewhat friendly. Bathroom was utterly disgusting but I heard the women's was clean. Doesn't matter because the food more than makes up for it. Took me a while to figure out that the restaurant was inside market village after driving around for a bit. If you don't care about decor, you will feel right at home here. There are deceiving 90s glass blocks with lights behind them that give the impression that it's perpetually daytime so when we left at 10pm we were surprised to see that it was dark outside. Wine was horrible but what do you expect... I was thrilled to have c plus and grape crush for the first time in years! And to top it all off, they sell dog clothes near the entrance."}
{"text":"********* 3.5 STARS********   I lost my Dim Sum virginity to Miu Garden, and I don't regret it :)  We came here on a weekday at 10:00 am and it was already really busy and loud!   This place serves traditional dim sum in push carts driven by persistent and charming ladies :) The atmosphere is loud, fun, and hectic. And I was told that it gets even louder and busier on weekends, which is pretty hard to imagine.   Everything I ate was tasty, including the chicken feet which were a first for me. Gelatinous, saucy, and totally yummy! The dumplings were ok, but the skin on the shrimp dumpling stuck to the plate and came apart when you picked it up. The pork buns were good and sticky, and the curry squid was lightly curried and garlicky. All in all, I enjoyed everything I ate but nothing was AMAZING.   Everything is super cheap ($2.00/dish) and so after all we ate, we ended up paying like $20.00 something dollars for all four of us, which was amazing! I don't think I've ever eaten this many dishes for such little money. Tea was FREE, and service was fast. If you are new to dim sum like me, Watch Out For The Carts! They will take you out if you don't get out of the way.   Definitely worth coming here for tasty and cheap dim sum in an authentic and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"On a nostalgic trip, I thought that I should come here for dim sum one more time before it goes for good. Located inside the soon to be demolished Market Village, this restaurant is now the sole surviving dimsum place since its competitor Ginger & Onion has closed shop.  Arriving 10 am on a weekday, I found the place to be almost full. Contrary to accounts of unfriendly servers, I found their service the same as you would find in other traditional dim sum places in the GTA.  You have the choice to order off a paper order form or wait for carts to come around.  As I wasn't sure how frequently the carts come around, I ordered off the paper form.  About 25% of the dishes arrived lukewarm.  I think it was because they took it off a cart without reheating it first, even if that cart had been out doing rounds already for a while.  The other 75% of dishes which arrived hot were good.  Portion sizes were ok.  Prices are good -  $2.50 per dish, from opening till 11 am.  As a bonus, tea is free!"}
{"text":"The food was decent. Went on a friday morning so it was all old folks. We ordered 10 things and got the pretty quickly. The staff was not really friendly, but then again they are super busy so i guess they are not meant to be. They have all the usual items ypu would see at a dim sum place. The bill came to be about 30 after tax. We couldnt eat all ten. Took back two boxes in doggie bags. Anywayz, i think its a good price for good food."}
{"text":"I usually don't write a negative review.  But this time if I can give zero stars I will.  Food is cold, and any frozen dim sum I could buy from supermarket is way much better than their dim sum.  I left after 10 minutes."}
{"text":"My husbands favourite place for dim sum because the price is right and he loves how they make their chicken feet. Because we come here so often for dim sum, the ladies who pushes the carts filled with hot steamy food would always recognize us. They would always say hi with a smile because that's just how often we go.  NEW OWNERS They have switched owners for quite some time. Not sure how many years it has been. The previous owners kept the restaurant classy where you order dim sum through paper. You'd always be guaranteed the dishes you want. However, the new owners uses the concept of food carts now. They have a hidden private room where people can sit inside where it's more quiet. The big con is, the food carts don't always make it to that room and people from the main room would have taken all the food already. You'd be waiting for a long time before food comes in. Not a good spot to eat. Just remember to eat in the main room - closer to the kitchen is best.  PRICE The cost of dim sum there is super affordable. Weekend price is still close to nothing compared to the fancy dim sum places.  HYGIENE Not the cleanest place to eat. Because the restaurant is located inside the mall (Market Village), it feels very stuffy and oily inside. Theres no air circulation. The bathrooms are dead dirty and women would urinate in mid air so you'd see urine being sprayed all over the seat. They'd have the pushing cart ladies clean up the toilets. These are people who serves the food on your table. I sure hope they clean their hands after the cleaning!  STAFF I find that the owner doesn't care much for their staff. I'd always hear the cart ladies gossip and they'd be gossiping about other staff members. Their secret spot to gossip is in the private room. They definitely don't work well together as a team. I personally only like the hostess (2 ladies with short hair) and 1 pushing cart lady who has quite the humour.   FOOD The food tastes great. They serve the crab claws during dim sum. And noticed that the crab claw balls don't have the claws in them anymore. It's just a crab balls now.  Suggestion: - Renovate the entire restaurant  - New carpet - New chairs - Staff encouragement from owners; keep the place positive - Hire a janitor rather than using your waitress to clean the bathrooms"}
{"text":"Weekday dim sum.  As it is in the Market Place shopping center there is abundant lot parking.  They have average restaurant decor, nothing memorable.    They bring the dim sum in carts or you can order something from the menu. The dim sum cart ladies are friendly & quick. Prices are very reasonable.    We ordered 6 dim sum plates none were bad, just not memorable. Miu Garden seems just fine for average dim sum. If you want gourmet dim sum I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Miu Garden in Market Village is packed every time.  It is still the old style with the cart where you see everyone fighting for the food.  Bad idea coming here as you need to flag down the lady or have them trying to upsell you there items.  This place is really really cheap and you can tell that by the way the restaurant is run.  It is quite dirty and seating is uncomfortable as you have other people's chair right against you.  Parking is a mess always at Market VIllage/Pacific so I try not to come here that often.  Rating:  Service: 2/5 Food Quality: 3/5 Comfort 1/5 Decor  2/5 Value: 4/5 Parking: 2/5"}
{"text":"- came here for dim sum - average joint, but totally serviceable. - nice thing is that they only had 2 \"sizes\" of dim sum. regular and special.... was surprised they didn't do the small, med, large, special thing like most places.  - found it odd that they also sold dried mushrooms and other goods along the side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The place looks old and a bit rundown?Don't let the look fool you...their food is pretty good. Service is pretty nice if you don't get loud and be bossy or cocky (common sense). The waiters are polite but busy all over, have a bit of patient and you will have a great time. For food look at my pictures =)"}
{"text":"The service is hit or miss when you want order food and not just grab it off a cart and said food will take quite a while prepare. Better off just eating off what carts have going around! Everything here was so CHEAP with pretty DECENT QUALITY food if not better.  You have to really use your eyes in a dim sum environment and pick which dish is the best out of the bunch. It's like playing cards; if you got a bad hand you gotta wait for the next round to draw better cards.  Luckily my table scored a few freshly made dishes and the taste, temperature, texture were pretty on point and ITS CHEAP. It literally can't get better than that.  NOTE: Ask for extra sauce if you can!  I recommend this place if you're at pmall for a quick dimsum grab, but I'm sure there are better places around Markham for this trade."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some coworkers for some cheap dim sum.  It's $2.40 a dish for all sizes during prime time lunch hour and drops to $1.98 at 1:30.  I think I saw before 11 am there were additional discounts as well.    There were push carts but they also gave us the option to order off a tick sheet.  The service here was really really slow - although typical for a Chinese restaurant.  I should clarify that the food came quickly, but if you needed your tea pot refilled or needed a take out box and the bill, we waited forever and had to ask 3 different servers before it was finally done.    Food itself was average but everything came out hot.    What I thought was weird about this restaurant was the servers were pushing around a cart selling dried goods.  I don't know what they were but it's the stuff my grandma buys to make Chinese soup."}
{"text":"This place is not bad, I'd rather goto ginger and onion that's in pacific mall area. The servers are rude here, they fling your plates, utensils and food on the table, then runaway like you have leprosy. The food is ok on some days and not on others. what irks me most is if you manage to get seated before 11am for example 10:50am they will mark it as 11:01 and charge you more per plate. I still go once in a while if I don't like waiting for ginger and onion or feel like I need to be abused."}
{"text":"Being inside the Market Village and near the food court, this place is always super busy on weekends, especially for dim sum.   This place gets high marks for having fresh good, wide selection of dim sum dishes from the very traditional like har gau, siu mai, chicken feet, rice rolls, pork feet stewed with ginger in sugary rice vinegar (I know it sounds \"strange\", but an acquired taste) to some new inventions. Amazingly low prices - they charge the same price per dish regardless of the size; the price is slightly cheaper on weekdays vs. weekends, and a further discount applied if you go off peak hours i.e. before 11am or after 1:30pm.   Service is ok - fast and efficient, but don't expect them to be chatty with you because everyone is literally running and busy.   Not a good place to go if you are looking for ambiance. But hey, that is not the strength of most Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"This has become my family's new favourite place for dim sum, which is kind of a big deal.  My favourite thing about this place is that they still have the push carts! What is fast becoming a dying tradition still lives strong here. Please note, the push carts are put away around 2-2:30pm, after which you need to order from a dim sum menu. At this time, it takes longer to get your food, though it's piping hot when it arrives.  The food itself is very good, nothing really stuck out but I thoroughly enjoyed it. $55 for 7 people including a beer for my out-of-place husband.  While we were leaving, my parents noted that they were setting up for a birthday party and a baby shower, so this place might be good for banquets.  Of course, parking is a nightmare and there was a huge lineup when we got there at 2pm, but we were seated quickly."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner was sorely disappointed. Mui Garden's offers a decent variety of dishes, but they were greasy and low quality. For the same price, there are plenty of other better options in the area."}
{"text":"It might have been a one-of experience but the day we came here, the dim sum was generally crappy. With Chinese dishes, there are so many variations that restaurants are bound to do some things good and some bad at some point. I felt Miu Garden had more bad than good compared with other similar restaurants. The quality of the pot rice was terrible. The rice did not \"absorb\" any taste and the texture of the chicken was bad. The shrimp rice rolls had a slightly soggy texture. Some \"simple\" dishes can't be screwed up but they seemed to have screwed up. The fried fish skin had far too much salt. There wasn't anything gross or inedible. Nearly all the dim sum dishes were subpar.  The prices are on the low side. This is one of those cases where I seemed to have gotten what I paid for. They even have fried noodles/rice for $4.99 but I imagine the quality wouldn't be very good.  I like how they have the push carts and you can also place orders individually.  One funny thing is that the owner seems to be running for Councillor. He has his poster and name (Miu) in the restaurant. If you're going to make crappy food, I'm not voting for you (not that I live in that area). I don't think I will come again even if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Came here during the week of Chinese New Years for dinner with my family.  It is located inside of Market Village.  The restaurant prior to Miu Garden was actually nice and higher end.  Miu Garden would've been the eunuch compared to the last establishment that was housed here.  Perhaps the most embarassing and tacky ritual practised at Miu Garden is the soliciting of luxury dried goods (shiitake mushrooms, conpoy etcetera).  No, they did not just let solicitors sneak their way in - this is I guess what you would call a \"side business\" of the restaurant.  The last thing I want to happen, is for my meal to be interrupted with bags of shiitake mushrooms invading my dining space.  I do not consider myself to be a savvy business women at all, but to me, anything that interferes with my core business (in this case, a restaurant) is bad for business.  We ordered a set menu for our table of 9.  For $168 we got served the following dishes:  Chinese \"Charcuterie\" Platter:  Consisting of jellyfish, duck, and char siu pork.  I am usually a stickler for dining etiquette but I actually spat out the so-called \"char siu pork.\"  Whatever it was, it was not char siu.  Fish Maw Soup:  Nothing too stellar, wasn't particularly flavourful.  Basa Fillet with \"Trees\":  This was a dish of fish that was served with gigantic stems of Chinese broccoli (hence the nickname trees).  It was extremely greasy and oily and whatever benefit of eating vegetables was probably destroyed.  Chinese \"Fried\" Chicken:  These usually are served with a colourful accompaniment of \"shrimp chips.\"  While the chicken itself was pretty decent, the shrimp chips were stale.  Yuck!  Yeung Chow Fried Rice:  The blandest I've ever had.  Yi Mein:  One of the better dishes of the night.  Not too oily and not bland like I've had at other restaurants.  There wasn't much shiitake though that is usually thinly sliced and mixed into the dish.   Ginger & Scallion Lobster:  Mostly shell, very little meat.  Rip off!  Honey Spare Ribs:  Pretty good.  Rivals some Korean restaurants' Kalbi.  My aunt found it a little too sweet though.  Shrimp, Celery & Snap Beans Stir Fry: Again, swimming in oil.  Not very flavourful either.    Bok Choy & Shiitake Mushrooms in an Enoki Mushroom & Conpoy Sauce: This was the most flavourful dish of the evening, but again quite oily.  Desserts for me were the most enjoyable part of the evening.  Aside from the standard Red Bean Soup, we were also served Honey Pound Cake & Almond Cookies.  I also noted that one of the dishes was dirty.  I will NOT be coming back to Miu Garden any time soon.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"Ah...old school dim sum..push carts..ladies yelling the food names in Chinese and if you have a non Asian friend, they show you what it is with some weird explanation...so  har gow is \"shrimp wrapped balls\" as opposed to \"shrimp dumplings\" lol.    Before 11 (or 11:30) and after 1:30 is one price for everything. LOVE IT!  They have your typical rice noodles, rice, har gow and siu mai, but being Chinese and all, I have to get the best value, so I wait the shrimp stuffed crab claws.    I have to admit, I've kind of fallen a bit out of love with these, but when my dad was still alive, he would always order them for a special occasion, so I feel like I have to order these to honour his memory.  But don't get me wrong, for the price, they are very good.    However, get here early or else it gets packed, but I think this is one of the better value dim sum places in Markham.  Oh yeah, parking is a nightmare on weekends."}
{"text":"Went here for good old Sunday dim sum. I did not enjoy the food and I was disgusted by the service. Employees here are rude   The food was slightly bland and some dishes were not fresh."}
{"text":"It's everything you can imagine for a Chinese restaurant.  The elegant dramatic decor, the busy staff doing MARATHONS and most of the restaurant blocked off for a 50th anniversary banquet celebration but no dance floor available which can be a good thing for the 2 left footers.  Food is A-OK priced and tasty, however the complimentary SOUP is pretty much salted water.  Portions did disappoint a little but then who asked us to come to a traditional Chinese restaurant in Market Village?  We got something that resembled a Sweet&Sour Shrimp Balls which was something I enjoyed with an interesting TEXTURE that is similar to the Fake-Lobster Balls sold at Chinese grocery markets except it is make with whole shrimps rolled into a ball shape.  The Crispy Fried Chicken has a nice thin crisp skin and flavoured as good as I've had anywhere else.  The whole plate was scattered full of Shrimp CHIPS more than usual which my believe is to do two purposes, to hide the lack of Chicken and to add to the plating appeal.  We had a vegetable dish that had Bok Choy, Shitake Mushroom and Sea Cucumber and OMG those Sea Cucumber was the size, color and shape of a Rats Penis.  It was FUNNY as one of the managers came by to sell some FRESH Sea Cucumbers to patrons for $20.00 which were actually worth the value while I stare at ours looking like Rat droppings.  With all this said, I would still consider coming back.  Especially when I paid my portion of $10.00 tax/tip INCLUDED for the whole dinner with a group of 9 regular consumers."}
{"text":"I've came here for dinner numerous times with family and relatives. Like many places it can be difficult to get a table on the weekends.   Their menu is very basic, nothing unique or out of the ordinary in comparison to other 'jau lau' (Chinese dinner-type) restaurants. They have really affordable set meals with a good selection of dishes to choose from. The food can be hit or miss; a good example is the crispy chicken which seems to be always different every time I visit... but generally the dishes are good.  As someone previously mentioned in the reviews they seem to be running some sort of side business selling luxury dried goods (sea cucumber, mushrooms etc.) They'll come interrupt your table asking if you would like to buy their dried items at a 'discount' price. The items are legit but their persuasive tone can be quite annoying when you decline to buy.  Overall this restaurant is a good place for a Chinese dinner, but don't expect to be wowed by the food. Generally you get what you pay for at this joint."}
{"text":"This review is for their dinner and not dim sum.   I'm giving this place 4 stars because the food we had was good (maybe because of the msg?) and with 8 ppl and 10 dishes (peking duck and lobster for example), it came to about $160 (tax and tip included).  Pretty good value!  I did get thirsty afterwards and it was greasy so you can tell it isn't entirely healthy.     I came here on a Tuesday night at around 7pm and the place was almost empty.  There were about 4 - 5 other groups but then the mall was practically empty as well.    People looking for a cheap Chinese meal should check this place out.  It isn't the perfect but for its price, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Unless you're desperately craving Dim Sum while in Market Village, you should probably avoid this place.  Miu Garden's overall quality is subpar and too inconsistent for me to recommend. While their prices are rather cheap, you should spend a bit more money and go elsewhere for a better experience.   Miu Garden is a hybrid cart/paper ordering style for dim sum. All the fried goods are on the carts while everything that is steamed is brought to you. I must say that is rather odd but anyways, long story short, the fried stuff is decent and the steamed stuff.. not so much.   Fried food sampled were the taro dumplings, crab claw, shrimps, eggplants/tofu. All were relatively warm/hot and tasted adequate. The only positive thing about this place are the cheap crab claws which everyone seemed to be grabbing by the plates. However the steamed items were terrible. I've haven't had worse chicken feet (one of my favorites) or curry cuttlefish before. It tasted bland, old, and just funky.   We called for the bill with a few items left to avoid any further disappointment. The bill was super cheap as we paid a weekday price of 2.70 per plate (peak noon price). There's also early bird pricing and post peak prices."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. Don't know how they are still in business. They even messed up lobster, the lobster meat was not fresh as it was mushy. We ordered 8 dishes and they were so carelessly prepared that I found small chopped bones in dishes that did not contain meat. I will not be returning and regret that they took my money!"}
{"text":"Sadly after coming here for dinner on two separate occasions, I don't think I'll be back in the near future. Their prices are still very economical, but the quality of their food is terrible. Huge globs of fat in their pork chops, consistently cold tea, thick and salty sauce on food. That alone could have justified a 3-star, but their atrocious service really knocks down another star. From the very start of the meal we were rushed, even though there were only 2 other tables eating dinner, and less than half the restaurant was full.  We were seated for a total of 1.5 hours, which in my opinion, is not that long for a simple dinner when going out, in fact I'd say 1.5 hours is very reasonable. However, when the soup came and after each of us had a bowl, they came by _twice_ and asked if we wanted seconds, or if they should just take it away. Both when we had received 3 out of 4 of our dishes and when we still had plenty of food on the table, they asked if we wanted takeout containers and the bill - we didn't even have all our food yet and we were still eating and talking. When clearing up our dishes, we asked about what desserts came with the meal set and the waitress just smirked a bit and rattled off the options. The bill came without us asking for it, and before we had even received our dessert soup, \"tong sui\", and some cookies/jello.  When paying the bill we decided to tip 10% even though we found the service to be very poor. After paying in cash and receiving the change, we left the change alone, since we were giving 10% tip, but a waitress walked by, flipped open our bill to take a look at our change and remarked that we should tip more. We put down $1 more and walked away, but the fact that you would openly request more tips when we had already given you 10% for atrocious service and a poor quality of food is appalling.   We definitely will not be returning any time soon. But I guess if you're looking simply at price, and don't care if the food quality is not on par and if you don't care at all about terrible service and tipping far more than they deserve, then Miu Garden could be a choice."}
{"text":"My first thought of when coming to Market Village was .....uh oh...Parking...lol.  Thankfully my family decided to come here on a weeknight. Smart Move!  Near the MKV foodcourt, MIU Garden is right across.  Just outside the entrance, they've got posted menu suggestions, especially for those that come in groups, which is great, rather than sitting down on to only realize this is your place to indulge in.  Our family took a meal for 6 and added three more items. On our table we had their: -chinese broccoli with seafood -beef with thousand island sauce -snow pea tip with garlic sauce -steamed fish -Cantonese fried noodle with assorted meat and seafood -House soup -Roasted chicken with chips ..................and something else..i forgot lol..  overall the food is pretty good, portions were a lot, please was reasonably clean, well priced and the service was efficient. There really isnt anything special about this plac, other than that they've got selection, food is GOOD, and its affordable."}
{"text":"Today I came here with my friends for dim sum and we were very disappointed. First of all they charged us $0.60 per person for tea ..... and all of y'all that eat dim sum regularly know that that's a giant red flag. I honestly think that's such a cheap tactic to get more money from their customers, I mean what's next??? Am I going to have to pay a rental fee for using chopsticks too???  As for the food, all of the dim sum items were very low quality. They were either stale, hard, or had a weird texture/consistency like they were leftovers that had been reheated. Perhaps it's because we went in on a weekday but that's still unacceptable. I'd be better off ordering dimsum at a grocery store tbh  Also when we ordered deep fried shrimp wontons, they served us mayo with it that was crusting and dried up around the sides like it was old .... gross. Plus the fried dough in the zhaliang (??) was very tough and stale so I'm almost certain that it was a leftover that was refried.  TLDR; LOW QUALITY DIM SUM. DON'T COME HERE UNLESS YOU'RE DESPERATE."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum on a weekday. Prices per plate were $2.60. Not including special items.   They do have the carts rolling around but it's not your traditional dim sum items. It only contained fried items like taro rolls, spring rolls, soft tofu pudding, crab claws etc.  You would need to order steamed or rice items from the list they provide you.   Tea costs 0.60 cents per person as well.  Dim sum came out SUPER SLOW. And some dishes were not piping hot or fresh tasting as well.  We sat at the restaurant for over 2 hours waiting for 6 items on the list we choose. Of those 2 didn't come and we gave up and got the bill.  I would personally not come here again. I did come a long time ago. Which by memory was definately a much better experience in terms of food quality.   Now not so much. Maybe they do better for dinner service as it is still open."}
{"text":"Came here last month, it was nothing too special. They have traditional push carts as well as a paper menu for people to order specific dim sum dishes that they want. The environment is pretty loud and very crammed all around. You'll typically see a line huge line up as the entrance area is relatively small compared to other restaurants.  Although push carts are very traditional for the dim sum setting, it gets annoying when you sit there for a while but the dishes that you want never appear. This is where the paper menu comes in handy!   Food quality wasn't anything special. You might as well stay in downtown Chinatown for other dim sum restaurants. Staff members are very rude and slow. I asked for a few glasses of ice water when we got seated, but the waitress didn't bring them to my table until as were at least half way into our meal. We also ordered a few items on the paper menu but that also took a while to come, so we called a waitress to ask her to help us follow up on it. Let me just say that she was NOT sincere towards us, AT ALL! It looked like we were bothering her just by asking her to check up on our food. I understand that they are busy, but at least be a little nicer to us, and we will be more willing to put up with the longer wait time.   Visited the restaurant again today, on a Sunday noon for dim sum. The waitress today has definitely set the bar for the restaurant. The ULTIMATE worst that they can be. I went today with big group of people, including my grandma and many other relatives. My table was very crowded with the table next to us but it was still do-able. One waitress came over and specifically SAID that she will be moving the table over to create more space for others. Alright, I'm willing to cooperate, that's not a problem. Except, she can't be any more RUDE and PATHETIC. She told everyone at my table to get up so she can move the table. The most important thing is, one of my relatives, which was an old granny, her leg isn't at the best state, so she took a little longer to get up and move. But, BEFORE she even fully got up, the waitress already used SO much force to pull the table top over which COMPLETELY knocked down my relative. We were ALL startled, and the granny was on the floor whimpering in pain still on her chair. No matter HOW busy they are, it does not mean that the waitress and just knock over people to get her job done.   In the end, we had to call for an ambulance to get the granny into the hospital. The restaurant agreed to take care of all charges, whether its the table from our food or for the medical expenses. We kept yelling at the waitress for her horrible service and behaviour. It caused a huge chaos. After the incident, we didn't even bother to finish our food and we all left. With this kind of service, you can count on it for me and my family to NEVER come back to this restaurant.   FYI: If you are looking/expecting for some form of \"nice\" service. Don't even bother with this place. It. Is. NOT WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Miu garden is far from anything new, but has a feeling of a traditional Chinese restaurant.  First walking in, it's not the cleanest or most elegant restaurant. The servers are not the friendliess, especially if it's a new customer. With that being said though, I've been here a number of times and my family just LOVES it. They're familiar with the restaurant, the traditional style, the people there as well.  For someone who's around the area, I would say there are much better places to explore.  However, Mui Garden has its charm - it is relatively cheap (a meal for 4 would be under $40 with left overs) and great to host for traditional Chinese families.  Fave dish here would actually the soup they give at the beginning. Everything else is pretyy mediocre, but hey, your wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"Food is Great! Portions are great and for a decent price!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place being great for dinner as they have all kinds of specials at night.  Well we came here for dim sum and boy was it a let down.  First of all, I was expecting to get somewhat decent service since it's a sit down, push cart dim sum restaurant.  Was I ever wrong, it would take a few different people asking for water and an extra plate and bowl.  Worst of all, the servers there don't even care, they spent much of their time talking.  Now the food wasn't anything to write home about it.  The dim sum wasn't the best and not up to all the hype we heard from other people that had been there.  Your better off going somewhere else other than this He** hole"}
{"text":"Crab shrimp ball - nice and crispy, good solid inside Har goe, shrimp dumpling - nice shrimp, wrapper is kinda gooey but shrmp is well flavored Sui mai, prok sumpling - nice texture, proper density, good flavor Salt and pepper calamari Pork ribs w rice - pork is a bit stick to bone but it comes off w work and tastes good though Shrimp egg rol - mushy lacks flavor and outside is not crispy Dough fritter rice crepe too dense and chewy and not crispy Shrimp and scallop dumpling, 1 scallop two shrimp in each dumpling, strong dog/nine veggie taste, not sure the english name of this herb Beef rice crepe good dense meat w good subtle flavor, Fish rice crepe wow what a fail, nowhere near as good as lst time, stingy overcooked small pieces of fish, last time this was the best, this time its a ltet down. Shrimp rice crepe standard Mango puree turnover, like bbq pork turnivers um, never cook mango.... Its way to dense for something that should be flaky  Seems to be the same service wise and same manager or owner is there. The prices are now ten cents more than my last post so on the plus side it is not much of an increase in price!"}
{"text":"This review is for a dim sum lunch on weekend.  Miu's Garden is the only indoor restaurant at Market Village Mall that serves dim sum.  What it has going for it are the convenient location and the low prices.  The dim sum were subpar during my visit.  The fried dim sum items tasted good; the steamed ones were average; the braised ones were pretty bad, mainly because they were still hard to the bite.  Some of the meat was past its prime and tasted slight spoiled.    Kindly note that if you visit during the time where there are push carts, what you order on the dim sum ordering sheet takes a long time to arrive.  If you are hungry, you get the food faster from the push carts.  However, har gor, siu mai, steamed beef balls, and shrimp rice rolls are often not in any push cart.  You have better change getting them through the ordering sheet."}
{"text":"Had dim sum with the parents. Its one of those few places left that still use the push carts. I thought I was the only one looking for push carts but glad to see others looking for the old school carts like me. It just gives the whole experience a better feel when its push cart style. The food itself is pretty standard and nothing really worth mentioning that stood out. The push cart ladies are really aggressive when trying to sell the food and what I really found weird was that they even tried to sell food ingredients  to take home like dried mushrooms. That was definitely a first and unexpected. I mean, if they're going to be selling stuff like that then whats to stop them from selling clothes, shoes and watches. Service was fast and many dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"Came into this place expecting the usual Chinese restaurant mantra: great price for decent food but was pleasantly surprised.  Pros: Lots of set meals to choose from Food is above average for prices  Cons: Fish dishes come out slow  Like I said, we were looking for a place for dinner that would offer decent food for a good price.  Miu Garden gets the good price part down normally.  However, the food was much better than to be expected.  I really enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  Miu garden offers a ton of set meals that patrons here mostly order from what I could tell.  They have set meals for different sizes of parties.  Set meals come out to about $8-$10 per dish depending on what the dishes are.  There's also the option of choosing your own dishes along with the usual half chicken and steamed fish.  You pick up to 4 accompanying sides to your liking. Dinner for 4 here will run just over $10 a person.     All meals here come with free soup and dessert.  You will have to order rice which comes at $1.50 a bowl.  We ordered the pick your dishes meal so along with the half chicken and steamed fish, we got the salt and pepper pork chop and a mushroom and bok choi veggie dish. The chicken comes out first and was fairly decent.  The pork chops and veggies come out next almost simultaneously.  I loved the pork chop here.  It was spicy, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  It was the perfect combination and easily one of the best salt and pepper pork chops in the city.  I grew up on that dish and it's one of my favs so it's great when it's done right!  The steamed fish comes out last.  It didn't come until more than midway into our meal.  The problem here is that steamed fish takes a set amount of time to make.  You can't really cut corners to save time.  If every table is ordering it, you will definitely fall behind if you don't have a crazy amount of steamers for the fish.  The fish though itself, was done superbly well!!  I was very impressed.  The fish was steamed just right, not overdone at all.  I couldn't believe I was having this in a set dinner honestly.  Staff and service here are also pretty good.  Everyone was nice and friendly.  It can get rather busy here but they get to everyone within a good amount of time.    Miu garden was a very pleasant surprise.  I came in with normal expectations and they were exceeded on almost every count.  I've only come for dim sum in the past, but now I know I'll be coming for dinner a lot more in the future."}
{"text":"The first few times I cam here, I did not like this place. However, I kept on going back because my parents like this place and it's close to where I live.  The four stars I rewarded this restaurant is mainly for their dim sum. I'm not a fan of their dinner menu because I find it a bit boring and it doesn't taste awesome.  Depending on what time you come here for dim sum, the quality of the dim sum varies. I think the food sucks early in the morning because there's not much variety. However, come during the lunch rush and I think the food is great. There are so many things to try and they sell stuff that other dim sum restaurants don't sell like egg pudding (which I actually don't even love but I just order it because not many dim sum restaurants sell it).  I don't have any issues with the service here. The place is quite big and it's clean. It can get annoying when one of the employees walk around trying to sell Chinese delicacy to us to make at home. Other than that, I really enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Have enjoyed dinner here many times in this restaurant at Market Village mall. Dishes were classic Cantonese, and we had on this occasion the jellyfish/charcuterie platter, deep fried fish tail, lobster, fish maw with vegetables, sharkfin soup, mushroom and broccoli, scallops/chicken/chinese celery, red bean soup, sesame cakes. We did buy the fish maw from the side business, be careful because you have to cook it soon - we didn't realize some of the bags had water in it, so the fish maw went bad before we could finish it."}
{"text":"I come  here with my parents. The price is cheap.  Food is sometimes hot, some time warm.  Cleanliness of this restaurant is questionable.  Washrooms are stay away condition.  If you want to have cheap dim sum, then come here.  If you want a clean environment, with good hot dim sum all the time, go elsewhere.  A few times I have found things in my dim sum.  Overall 2 stars."}
{"text":"This place has got to be my favorite place for Dim Sum these days. Seems like all the places i used to frequent have all gone.  This place definitely has a good varied choice of items Probably due to the large clientele they know that it will not go to waste I've never had problems with the service And although most cart pushers don't speak English there's always one that does and helps them out.  The best part is after being stuffed like a Beijing duck the bill comes to $21 for 7 items!!! Can't beat that anywhere!"}
{"text":"Had not been to Miu's for a long time - we were doing some shopping in the area, and decided to go in.  It was ok, not fantastic, but ok.  Decor-wise, it reminded me a lot of some of the upstairs restaurants on the side streets of Tsim-sha-Tsui in Kowloon.  The foong-jow really disappointed me.  I have had better.  The beef balls were well-seasoned.  The fish ball dumpling soup was the star of the show.  The wrappers on the vegetarian yum cha were too thick.  But:   ambience-wise, it was a good experience.  The hostess was pleasant and the ladies with the trolleys, very helpful.  I agree with Alina M. on here - for a simple dim-sum fix, it is good."}
{"text":"Food ok. Nothing spectacular but not bad. didn't expect the plates to be clean but it was pretty dirty. and the washrooms were dirty too. It was all clogged I couldn't even use it."}
{"text":"Been here many times for dinner.   Can't comment much on the dinner, it taste OK, but nothing special.  We ordered the 8 course meal cause its cheap.  Of course it doesn't come with everything you want though because they gave you a discount.  Went there for dim sum, pretty fast service.  For the the price, you can't complain, its 2.10 for all the items during the weekdays rather than 4 dollars you would pay for a large at another restaurant which is way too expensive.  Service was there when i needed it.  Push carts came with some food, but you mainly order from the order sheet.    Food was OK, but I'll admit that it doesn't taste as good as the more expensive restaurants.  But you can't complain, when your playing almost double for more quality.  Good place for people with a budget.  Not so much if your trying to impress your date or your parents."}
{"text":"Must try: Taro Cake (the triangle)  We haven't been here in a while and I'm not sure if the quality has gone downhill, if my dim sum standards have gone up, or it's an off day, but we were left overall unsatisfied with the food.   General themes: 1. The shrimp is not succulent or fresh. And really, what's dim sum without good shrimp? It's in 80% of the dishes. 2. Dishes were way too salty. (1) Turnip Cake is good for its mild taste with the occasional zing from the meat or dried shrimp bits, don't ruin that with sodium overload. Same goes for (2) Crab Balls...  3. Dishes that used to be good no longer is. The (3) Steamed Rice with Sparerib barely had spareribs and the nonexistent spareribs barely had any meat on them. The (4) Durian Pastry was crumbled and sad looking. Worst was the (5) Custard and Egg Yolk Bun... the bun was hard and grey instead of fluffy and white, it's dense like it didn't rise properly and the inside was separating (egg yolk and sugary syrup). Ughhh disappointment.  4. Some dishes are just what the random... These might just be our mistake in ordering, so take with grain of salt. (6) Deep Fried Salad Shrimp Roll does not work, period.   Good thing there are plenty of dim sum places to go around. Will maybe drop by if in the area, will not make effort to come again.   WYWH"}
{"text":"Came here just because Sam's congee had a long lineup.   Dim sum quality is subpar. Food had a weird taste and color. It is first time I would give up the food because I am afraid of eating some chemical that will harm my body.   I would never return again."}
{"text":"My friend and I were hesitant to go here because we were afraid none of the people who work here spoke fluent english. Although, as we entered, a polite, nice lady who was fluent in English welcomed us, seated us, and gave us an English checklist menu. The ambience was very loud as usual for Dim Sum restaurants in the morning. The checklist menu offered plenty of food options which my friend and I liked such as Siu Mai, Steamed Rice Noodle, Chicken Feet, and more. They also provided us with complimentary tea. All of our food came within a decent amount of time. The quality of the food was okay, it definitely didn't taste as if it was premium quality, it was just okay. Miu Garden provides special and affordable prices every morning which was good.   Overall, Miu Garden is not the best Dim Sum restaurant I have been to, but it was basically decent and a good place to eat in the morning if you are secluded within Market Village or Pacific Mall area."}
{"text":"We went here for dim sum the day after we arrived in Toronto. I was psyched and looking forward to trying dim sum in Canada. This place didn't disappoint. There were many varieties that I don't get to try in NJ. Everything was fresh and hot.  The 2 things I didn't care for was the dim sum cart ladies were VERY pushy. They really try and get you to try all their stuff on their carts. You have to be insistent and say no thanks. Otherwise, before you know it, the dim sum will be on your table. Another thing I didn't care for was the restaurant trying to sell their dried goods to you. I mean, those things should be sold in a supermarket, not in a restaurant! Will still return when in the area!"}
{"text":"Dim sum quality was very good. I came from New York City where dim sum is pretty good and this place was comparable and better in some ways. Price was very good. Ordered around 15 plates and the price was 36 Canadian dollars. Shrimps were a good size in the rice rolls, and taste was good. No complaints here. They still use carts for certain items, but most of the items had to be ordered with the sheet. Some items took longer than others."}
{"text":"Came here around 1pm on a Monday. Pretty busy but luckily didn't have to wait for a table. It's $2.70 for all dim sum and $0.60 for tea per person.   They advertised their crab claw dim sum outside their restaurant so we decided to give it a try. Not bad. It's really a big ball of shrimp around a small crab claw. It comes with a small dish of vinegar,which helped to bring it the flavor...I found it kind of bland to eat it on its own.   Curry octopus was tender but not spicy and didn't have much curry flavour but I find that's how it is usually made at most dim sum places.  My bf ate all the shrimp dumplings and rice noodle with BBQ pork so his verdict on them was \"it was alright\" lol   Steamed rice was a little dry and the beef is the same consistency as the beef balls you would typically have at dim sum restaurants. It's almost like a firm beef paste? Doesn't taste much like beef to be honest.   Deep fried dough in rice noodle was ok. Good that the deep fried dough stick wasn't stale, so the bread was still soft.   Overall, not bad. Standard dim sum restaurant. Would return if I'm craving dim sum and at market village."}
{"text":"My quest for traditional dim sum places with push carts continues...  Miu Garden is one of the traditonal dim sum restaurants that has dim sum served from push carts. I have to tell you the ladies here are so aggressive when trying to make you order from them. They willing to tell your friend how handsome he looks and flirts/compliments him in order to make a sale... Or they will try dumping them on your table.. and the secret is telling them No No No!  They offer dim sum specials the whole day, and if you pay before 11 AM no charge for tea. Their dim sum is One price $2.10 for all sizes and even cheaper for afternoon tea. Their dim sums portions are all pretty big like mega size Hai Gow..  but they do compensate the quality over the quantity. Especially someone was complaining that they put the mushroom stems in their Siu Mai which is a No No.  Miu Garden does have the feel of a traditional restaurants when everyone talks at the top of their voices thus result in  a noisy and lively eating environment. The services are not that bad. We don't even need to wait for our bills, the waiter has a chart and tell us exactly how much our meals cost in 10 sec when I called him over!  All our fellow yelpers were happy when the bills come up to be $6.50 per person tax and tips in!"}
{"text":"I've found a few favourites at this place so far... the combo with the steamed fish, chicken, and 2 dishes of your choice is best complemented with snow pea leaves w/ garlic and the cashews, shrimps and vegetables dish. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Came for dim sum on an early Saturday and just got in before the lines started.  A not very large dim sum place in Market Village.  They were having a special while we were in town, with all dim sum only costing 2.50 on wkends (and lower still on wkdays).  Dim sum came off rolling food carts, and there seemed to be a reasonably decent variety available.  We had the pig's blood (excellent), spinach in broth (very good), seafood dumpling in soup (very good), steamed beef rice rolls (very good), beef tripe and offal with turnip (so-so).  Overall, seems a solid spot for dim sum, with a really great price tag."}
