{"text":"We stopped in for lunch after a round of golf and were very happy.  I had the Blue Burger.  Good size and good flavor.  It went well with a cold beer.  She had the Taco salad and said it had a good flavor and the cool side felt good after a hot day in the sun.  The place was very clean and the staff was friendly.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went to rochesters the other day it was a beautiful hot day was wanting to sit on the patio overlooking the beautiful golf course it was closed due to a special function which was fine my boyfriend and I and our 2friends who have never been there sat in the bar area got our drinks thinking about getting an appetizer I went and got menus apparently the bartender was too busy (doing nothing) she finally came over to us told her we were just looking we were fine we figured if it takes her this long to get to us how long would we have to wait for appetizer it wasn't busy at all inside there staff is a bunch of wall learners which it always has been it reminds me of being in high school again my friend and I needed to go to restroom (he was already told the patio closed) I saw an old coworker was saying hello the owner Jamie in walking by said patio closed I don't know where you going but patio closed not only did she rudely interrupt but I turned to her and said I'm going to the bathroom so I get back to the table I just wanted to suck down my beer and leave the place was pretty warm inside as well they didn't even have ceiling fans on heaven forbid so needless to say our friends were not impressed which I can't blame them but here I bragged of the place and I was embarrassed for even taking them there lesson learned that won't happen again"}
{"text":"We have been here several times because it is convenient. Tonight was not a good experience. I ordered coconut shrimp which were good. However it came with a baked potato way passed it's prime and some vegetables which were indistinguishable. They may have been zucchini in another life. My husband ordered the prime rib. It was so salty he didn't bother taking leftovers home."}
{"text":"Two Fish Fry Friday's dining on the patio in the same month.  Service was very extremely poor each time.  Server is young, untrained, inexperienced, disorganized and rude.  Doesn't have a clue about customer service, no organizational skills or communication skills.  Hopefully she'll be long gone before you have to be served by her.  We've moved on - too many great places in this community."}
{"text":"We have a home in Fountain of the Sun where another Rochester's is located. They're currently closed for the summer. Went to the original location and it also is fantastic!! You can't find a better fish fry!! All of their food, at either location, is fresh and wonderful!! Service is excellent as well!!"}
{"text":"I went to Rochesters today but didn't go in because handicap parking is very bad unless you can walk a good distance or climb stairs.  This business is for healthy golfers or golf carts only.  If you are driving a golf cart parking is convient.  This is wrong.  Rochesters need to fix this."}
{"text":"Sweet little hidden gem. Not the least bit pretentious, just good food and good service at great prices!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came into Rochester's to watch football on a Sunday with my fiance and had a blast. Their hot wings has become a must have for me every Sunday. It is pretty incredible how so many restaurants and bars actually mess up this great American classic. I asked the waitress to add a little bit of kick to my wings and what did I get in return? These wings came out blazing! Just hot enough that it wasn't over the top and still enjoyable. Most importantly, I judge wings by how crispy they are, yet still tender in the middle. What ever they toss their wings in is a sure treat; amazing flavor for anyone who loves wings. Try them with your favorite beer (mine is Stella). All in all, the food was great, prompt and courteous service, and won't put a hole in your wallet. Definitely one of my favorite places for great food and beer."}
{"text":"Always fantastic food! Always a huge portion. Never had a bad bite of anything here. Daily specials so check their menu! Great and cheap!!"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of a 55+ community, Rochester's is open to the public. There is indoor/outdoor seating with golf course views. There is a bar, tv's, ample seating and a large room to host a party or larger groups. We stopped in on a Saturday morning, we were greeted with big hello's and smiles. The place was empty except for a few guys in there enjoying their morning cup of joe. Our waitress took our drink order and gave us ample time to review the menu. I decided on 2 eggs, toast, and home fries. I ordered my eggs over hard, whole wheat toast, and oj. The orange came out in a large glass, which surprised me as most places give small glasses. A short time after ordering, our food was delivered piping hot to our table. My eggs were cooked perfectly, the home fries were crispy and mixed with peppers and onions, and my toast was toasted to a perfect shade of brown. The portions are big, so either come starving or be prepared to go home with a doggie bag. Rochester's did not disappoint, and you can count on me being a return customer!"}
{"text":"Great lunch!  First time we've been here.  had the best BLT sandwich ever!  My other half had the French Dip Roast Beef sandwich  & Chicken Rice soup.  His food was great also as was the service.  Definitely will come back again. We stopped at Rochester's  to see what the place was like and what kind of food they have because our favorite karaoke entertainers will be starting their karaoke venue here this week. The dinner menu looks good, so we're looking forward to coming back here weekly on karaoke night.  This place makes it on our favorite lunch spots list!"}
{"text":"Came in for Wednesday night karaoke with a group of friends! Place was packed and very busy! Waitress was super nice! Great night had tons of fun and the food was AMAZING! We had the whiskey wings and my friend had a chef salad that was exceptional! Great place with great fun and lots of dancing! Very impressed will be back!!! See you next Wednesday!"}
{"text":"We hit this place at 345 on a friday , fully intending to assault the friday fish fry. I hadnt eaten all day and was ready!!! We got here early enough and the place LOADED up at 4pm like a flood gate opened. I ordered a side salad and it was good... a mistake but good salad.  The chowder was thick and rich and loaded with clams. The fish promptly arrived as we reveled in the crowds of people. It was hot appealing, better than the pictures, our tea was filled frequently. The fries were good but not needed the planks of fish were generous portions of flaky even coated tempura goodness. We will be back... after lent"}
{"text":"I came in on a Thursday evening. There was karaoke going on so the place was packed. I sat at the bar. I ordered the Famous Rochester's Bogie Burger. This is a deluxe? version of the regular bogie burger. This one comes with bacon, melted cheese, tomato, lettuce, onion, and special sauce. It was on an artisan bun. I enjoyed every bite. The fries were ok, but the burger was the highlight of the meal. I will be back for another very soon."}
{"text":"We've eaten there on many Friday fish fry's and it has always been great. You get clam chowder with your meal in place of a salad and I truly love salads, but don't miss it, as they have the best clam chowder I've ever had. The fish is great too! Two pieces fill me & my husband, so AUCE is not necessary. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Typical clubhouse food. Bunker burger was ok-little over cooked, making it on the dry side.  Sweet potato fries are thick and flavorful-can actually taste the sweet potato. Beer could have been colder for a 100 degree day though."}
