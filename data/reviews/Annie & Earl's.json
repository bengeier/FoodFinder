{"text":"Service was slow, one waitress seemed overwhelmed n loudly expressed it to customers, placing blame. Some customers also had long wait times before bing greeted n order taken. Food was OK not great"}
{"text":"Annie and Earl's is a place I'm happy to support. They're clearly family owned, the folks that work there are friendly, their prices are low, and their food is decent quality.  It's a great low-frills diner. Definitely fits in the greasy spoon category - greasier than Superior Restaurant (a plus), less greasy than Steve's Lunch (as if it were possible to be as greasy as Steve's), better food and price than Shay's next door (but equally greasy)."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place after reading all the good reviews on it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The customer service is very lacking - I went at about noon on a weekday and there was only one other customer waiting. After taking my order take-out order, the servers stood around talking. All I ordered was a Joe's Belly Buster (eggs, french toast, potatoes, and sausage) - I waited 30 minutes before I asked one of the workers if my order was done. I ended up waiting another 10 minutes before my order was done - turns out they forgot to make my order. The person, who got there before me, waited even longer for theirs - turns out that they forgot to make his order too...when there are only 2 customers there. The food was passable but nothing spectacular for the wait and the sausage was gross. On top of that, all their prices have gone up, so if you are looking at their menu online, you might want to double check to see what the real price is. I'll stick to my usual place that is also off St. Clair Ave - The Fifth Wheel."}
{"text":"From the second my friend and I walked in we were greeted warmly. Our waitress was so kind and attentive. I had read reviews for this place and everyone seemed to be suggesting pancakes so I had to taste myself. THEY WERE EXCELLENT! Everything was so tasty and affordable. The inside is super cute too!   Cage free eggs They buy from local farmers  I definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Cleveland, a business acquaintance suggested that we meet for breakfast here. I arrived and this place is truly no frills - so initially I was hesitant, but it was pretty full and I was trusting his judgement.   We sat down and immediately were greeted by the friendliest waitress. We were seriously debating what to get and decided on two dishes to share.   The prices here are very cheap, especially considering the amount and quality of food. I would definitely return here and would recommend anyone passing through this area, who enjoys a good old school diner to stop here."}
{"text":"We had a long layover in Cleveland and drove from the airport to eat here!  It was well worth it.   Annette our waitress was friendly, had us laughing and was very patient with us explaining the menu.   Ms. Annie (Lois) came out to give a shout to us. She was very nice and told me where I could shop.   Now for the food- Fantastic!  Real down home cooking. Just like your. Mama and grandma made.   Hugh portions. Large pancake was delis! Home fries the bomb. Cheese omelette just the right amount of cheese.   If I ever comeback to Cleveland. I'm coming here to eat!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. I was there for a business meeting this morning.  The place was incredibly clean and the staff was ever so friendly. The pancakes were delicious. The waitress bragged about the made from scratch product. It is well worth it.  I would suggest everyone to go."}
{"text":"The pancakes are very good and the food is made from scratch. These aren't out the box pancakes and the difference in taste is very noticable. Had the pancake starter combo with scrambled eggs, and substituted meat for home fries potatoes. The only thing keeping my rating from being a 5 star was the their orange juice game. Pancakes on fleek orange juice on bleak.  Here's a hint either do fresh squeezed OJ or Simply. Try this hidden gem out. Prices and food are great."}
{"text":"I  love a nicely sized piece of fresh, crispy fish! Mom & I enjoyed our fish-n-grits breakfast...The pancakes---flavorful & fluffy--NOT your average diner pancake! There's love in that recipe The friendly customer service and tasty, filling breakfast will keep us coming back Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST pancakes I have ever had anywhere, and I consider myself a world traveler.  The coffee is great too.  Everything is made from scratch and is about half the price of your chain breakfast places."}
{"text":"Fluffiest pancakes I've ever had! Great service and great cool atmosphere! The Belly Buster is definitely a belly buster but a solid hearty meal!"}
{"text":"Best food on our entire trip! The staff was very friendly and welcoming. We definitely found a local hotspot! The pancakes are AMAZING as well as the salmon cakes. Highly recommend to anyone who wants a \"home cooked\" breakfast. If we are ever back in Cleveland, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Pancakes are the foundation of any nutritious breakfast. I read something somewhere on the internet that says that. I think. Anyway that doesn't matter. Sometimes i just need some pancakes.   When i get a hold of a place that gives me the pancakes i need when I need them I  take notice. Their pancakes are more than amazing. Something beyond your regular standard pancake. Place is cozy. Service is friendly and great. Price is nice. For me though it all came down to those pancakes. These pancakes may bring world peace to these troubling times.   Everyone needs to start their morning here."}
{"text":"Very good food especially the fish and scrambled eggs with cheese it's delicious...try it out small but great food! I will go back to try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"Pancakes. Get them.   I'm not even a pancake person. I don't ever order them- keep my breakfast savory, please. Not here! The pancakes are incredible. I had so many crispy edges- daaaang. Also, the syrup is NOT watery stuff. Nope! Full flavah.  My eggs were delicious as well! Much better than most diners. Sausage patties are scrumptious.  The price is also right- $6 gets you a huge meal and coffee. Service is wonderful- we got tons of coffee refills and everyone is really friendly.  Only cons? Took awhile for our meal and not many others were there. I would go here when time isn't tight."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on our way home to Toronto on a Wednesday morning. This is a down home greasy spoon that does breakfast right.  We were kindly greeted by the staff and seated ourselves.  We had hot coffees ready as we checked out the menu.  My wife opted for the fried green tomato  breakfast and I had the pancake breakfast.  The meals came with eggs (we took them scrambled) and bacon or sausage. The eggs were amazing cooked just right not under done or over done. My wife's tomatoes were great, better than we had a fancy spot in Louisville. The pancakes were amazing. 3 fluffy made from scratch pancakes that were golden brown. Try these.  The sausage was also surprisingly good.  Not sure if they were homemade or not. The best part the meal came in under $15! Check this place out the food is high quality, portions are huge, and prices are great."}
{"text":"Being in Cleveland for a business trip, I longed for sweet Ohio soul cooking that reminded me on my grandma. Annie and Earl's was a slam dunk. My uber driver gave me the recommendation and I am so thankful! The ambiance was of a typical pancake house but one that your auntie and uncle own. The staff was very friendly. The restaurant is huge with plenty of seating. The food was phenomenal. I had pancakes, eggs, bacon, and a salmon cake. The salmon cake was so juicy, and fresh. Many restaurants do not make their food scratch. At Annie and Earl's they make everything fresh and high quality.  I also had a coffee, which had a cinnamon base. The best part is my entire meal came up to just over $10. Yes $10!! It's very inexpensive. Affordable food, with a spectacular dining experience. If you are in the Cleveland area, you have to give Annie's and Earl's a try. Forget the other brunch places, this is a true gem! ( Not sure why it says they are closed during the weekends, not true)"}
