{"text":"I had the traditional galette and a cinnamon bun.  It was soooo good. I definitely recommend this place and will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Best Nutella crepe and coffee! Everything I've had here is so fancy and delicious. The gentleman here have great accents and warm smiles."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great croissants. Really good quiche. Coffee is fresh and tastes like the beans are not old and stale. Almond croissants are notably good.  No icky goo in the middle like some places. Great ambience.  While the decor is sparse, the feeling is very comfortable and relaxing while you enjoy your treat here.  Count me as a regular."}
{"text":"Great  coffee and pastries. My fav its the nutella brioche. I tried the croissant and the mushroom quiche. Just delicious. If you like something sweet and sour try the lemon tart."}
{"text":"The quiche is fabulously creamy with a wonderful crust. If eating in, it is served with a perfect salad and vinaigrette. In addition to the amazing French pastries and croissant, they serve La Calombe coffee which people might recognize from the tv show Dangerous Grounds. This is truly a bit of France in our back yard."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, one of the founders of this new French cafe is a former chef at Wynn.  And you can see from the pastry selections that he has brought that high-end gourmet feel to this quaint off-strip cafe.  The interior is plain and simple -- doesn't really look like what you might think a french cafe would look like.  But that's not so important because the food offerings are exactly what you would expect.  Other reviewers have already praised the cinnamon roll...and there are plenty of other intriguing delicacies beyond the usual french cafe fare (nutella brioche anyone?).  The cafe also has a small selection of macaroons although I'll wait until I see the more unusual flavors I prefer to eat such as bubble gum and cotton candy (hopefully they will be adding more over time).  But what has kept me coming back to this little cafe are the crepes.   While the crepe menu is a little on the limited side, the taste and texture of the crepe is exactly what you would expect to experience in a french cafe.  Have had the classic nutella and whip cream, nutella and pineapple, caramel and butter, and the vanilla and pineapple (with coconut ice cream).  The presentation (which is a little different than other crepe places) is to fold the round sides of the crepe over so that the entire crepe is more of a square with the sauce sprayed on the top (along with fruit if you order one with fruit) and then the whipped cream sprayed on top in a line (and it is real whip cream too...not Redi-whip).  While the cafe's location near Ft. Apache and Spring Mountain is a little unusual (not where you would expect such a cafe to be located), it's more convenient for me than to go to the strip (especially with every casino beginning to charge locals parking :(   Overall, I would recommend Cafe Briezh to anybody I know who craves authentic, gourmet french pastries and crepes."}
{"text":"I am french and i know wath is a good croissant ,good crepes ,and quality pastry . I CAN TELL YOU CAFE BREIZ IS VERY VERY GOOD . I dont know the management but big bravo . I will be a regular for sur."}
{"text":"Two words: Mouth. Gasm. Best pain chocolat I've ever had. Almond croissant is bomb, coffee on point. Will become local phenomenon. Go here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  An authentic French bakery and cafe, this place has the best croissants, crepes, pastries and coffee in town.  When you walk in you're immediately entranced by the wonderful smells of all the baked goods, and the decor of the cafe is so bright and airy and inviting.  I never write reviews, but I just felt compelled to write about this great new place.   We had the galette with mushrooms, goat cheese and bacon, the crepe with Nutella and bananas, the Quiche with salmon and broccoli, a Croissant, an Apple Turnover and a Chocolate Croissant... all were absolutely delicious.  If we could've eaten more we would have.  We loved it so much we bought some macarons and a lemon tart to bring home.  And the coffees were fantastic too, not like the weak or bitter coffee you typically get everywhere else!  Everything we had was so tasty, and to top it all off their customer service was just terrific too.  Now we just can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing !!! Amazing!!! Amazing!! Had a crepe with buttered caramel and apples...decadent...delicious with a freshly made cappuccino. They spent a good amount of time just making the cappuccino but worth the wait and perfectly made. And the crepe with caramel butter . We will be back asap. Next time...tiramisu or the Nutella brioche. Made by real French bakers."}
{"text":"My foodie husband, two growing sons (13 and 12), and I love Cafe Breizh!  Frenchmen Chef Pierre and Chef Jerome and their delightful Café Breizh are a welcome addition to the Summerlin-area.  Chef Pierre, a former Executive Pastry Chef at the Wynn and Encore resort hotels on the Las Vegas Strip, has brought his culinary passion to the suburbs.  The ethnically-diverse, surrounding neighborhoods and nearby Summerlin villages provide a steady stream of loyal customers such as my family.  Since the French cafe's opening, we have thoroughly enjoyed as follows (the quality has been consistent): every type of quiche offered and accompanying side salad; the traditional galette; ham and cheese croissant; croissant; pain chocolate; nutella brioche; cinnamon roll; tiramisu; every flavor of macaron; chocolate chip cookie; oatmeal raisin cookie; coffee by La Colombe; and hot chocolate.  I'll be getting a crepe next time I go there.  For that upcoming special occasion, I plan to order one of their custom-made, elegant cakes.  Before having kids, my husband and I backpacked in Europe to include France.  Café Breizh's food and beverage is as good as it gets, if not better -- simply excellent.  My boys thoroughly enjoy watching Chef Jerome make galettes and crepes for customers.  This small, non-chain business has earned my family's support so much that we have highly recommended our family and friends to pay a visit to the café."}
{"text":"Delicious! This really is reminiscent of a bakery in France. The pastries taste of the highest quality made by chefs. The prices are decent for what you get especially when you see what other bakeries and cafes charge.  100% recommend!"}
{"text":"The Quiche Lorraine was really yummy & cafe hit the spot. There were even two men speaking in French so that was a bonus!"}
{"text":"In town for a women's hockey tournament close by and wandered in here for some pre game coffee. To my delight and surprise this clean and elegant pastry shop had exceptional imported french coffee and a tantalizing display of beautifully crafted pastry. I ordered the cinnamon roll and shared it with my husband. We almost cried it tasted so good!! We came back here 2 more times over the course of our trip trying as many of the pastries as possible and nothing we had was short of incredible. Thank you for sharing your skill and passion, Chef! We will see you again next year!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a late morning coffee and there were plenty of freshly baked goods. We travel frequently and search out good bakeries wherever we go. This one ranks among the best French style bakeries. The warmed almond croissant and cinnamon roll were excellent, crispy, buttery and not too sweet. Our stop here was well worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We stopped in on our way to Red Rocks. We both had Galettes, mine was Le Tradition, hers La Norveginne. Both were excellent. Perfectly cooked and amazing flavor. We got a blueberry muffin and a strawberry to go and ate them after our hike. Again, perfect.  The service was outstanding and this is a place I wished was in my home area! It is the kind of place I will tell my friends to make a point of visiting when they are in Las Vegas! The locals are lucky to have this wonderful cafe."}
{"text":"This is exactly what Las Vegas needs!!! More small cafes and independently owned restaurants!! This was so fantastic and great service as well. The almond croissant, crepes, galette, croissant sandwich, cinnamon roll, were all wonderful!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing little bakery. Had the ham and cheese croissant! It was delicious and flakey. Ordered 2 to go pastries as well, both were great. I would absolutely return."}
{"text":"Back again! (actually, we stop here several times when we're in town) This trip, we brought my sister and her family and now, they are fans. We always try to have something different when we are here. This trip, we had the Ham & Cheese Croissant, Tiramisu, Napoleon, Crepe (Nutella with bananas) and Croque Monsieur. As always, absolutely marvelous!"}
{"text":"Cafe Breizh is such a perfect breakfast spot to have so close to home. The menu options are curated to offer a smaller but well rounded selection of French pastries and other breakfast staples. I have tried the traditional galette, pain chocolat, nutella brioche, nutella and banana crepe, and a few bites of my cousin's caramel butter crepe. Honestly everything is delicious! There is nothing I wouldn't get again! As for the coffee the cappuccinos and au laits are both fantastic. I really enjoy coming here on the weekends as a special treat."}
{"text":"Cafe Breizh looked interesting and I lived nearby so I thought I'd give it a try today. I walked in and wasn't greeted by the gentlemen, I had some eye contact but nothing friendly. I walked to the front to look at what they had to offer. I was excited to try the quiche, they had salmon quiche, mushroom and spinach quiche, and another one that looked good as well. I was waiting for the lady in front of me to finish her transaction and then 3 asian ladies came in at this moment. They were greeted with a hello and a smile. So it was at this moment I felt a little jaded. Also those three asian ladies didn't consider I was in line and walked past me to the register to get the man's attention. The man looks at me and I nod at him to get his attention because I wanted to just eat some quiche, man! They ladies talk before he walks over to me and he starts taking their order first.   So, I'll try Cafe Breizh another time. Perhaps.  Tl;Dr: Didn't acknowledge me, let others order before me, I just left. Food looked good, decor is simple but cute."}
{"text":"Croque Madame! One of the best I've ever had! Yellow yolk running over the golden crusty béchamel. Beautiful!! Beautiful pastries, I had to try a variety to take home. What a French jewel hiding near the Dollar Store. Have to be back to try the crepes to go along with my hot cappuccino."}
{"text":"Can you say hellllllllo! Or shall I say bon jour! This place is very simple and fresh with styling and simple menu. From the delicious water, coffee, can I say wow to the croque madame! So delicious!! This makes me want to fly to France, I'm booking my ticket now! Ok maybe not but wishful thinking... definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"We came late so a lot of the best goodies were gone. Even so, the service was outstanding and the goodies we did get were delicious! The chocolate croissants are massive and basically twice the size of what you would get anywhere else for the same price! I can't wait to come back earlier so I can try out some of the items we missed!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop recently. Love their lemon tart, chocolate croissant the most. Their hazelnut cappuccino is pretty good also. Definitely recommend this shop for everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing! I lived in Europe for years these pastries remind me of my time there. Croissants are fantastic & I must say the blueberry muffin like inna class of its own, perfectly balanced not too sweet, loaded with fresh berries & the top oh me oh my!"}
{"text":"Delicious pastries and excellent capuchinos! Plus authentically French baker....how can it get better?"}
{"text":"I Had a great experience at Cafe Breizh, the food here is amazing, as soon as you walk in the establishment you are well greeted by the staff, this time Sam made me feel I was at home and took the time to go over the pastries and crepes showing me pictures of the dishes, I highly recommend the apple caramel crepes and the lemon tart the best. I will definitely recommend to my family, friends, and anyone that really wants to have a delicious French desserts."}
{"text":"Saturday morning breakfast after reading their reviews and been told the owner was a former pastry chef on the strip we decided to give this bakery a go.  their menu was simple and enticing with all the French basics like croissants and crepes and quiche. Food  is pricey and honestly I was not that impress after having a quiche Loraine and I ham and cheese croissant with some taste like crystal light lemonade requested some ice but never got it ;( I mostly sure I will not be coming back..."}
{"text":"Delicious croissants. Crepes also  great.  Reasonably priced. Friendly staff.  I think I've  tried just about everything and no complaints."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, and sparklingly clean. The prices are reasonable, and like other reviews say, their cinnamon rolls are incredible.  The quiche Lorraine was the best I've ever had, nice and light, not too heavy at all.  The menu is simple but each offering is perfectly executed, service was quick and pleasant. This will be in our regular breakfast spot rotation!"}
{"text":"Everything here from the quiche to the galettes to the crepes to the coffee is excellent. Recommended."}
{"text":"Galettes and baked goods are consistently outstanding."}
{"text":"currently my favorite galette place in town. Supper close to my house. Clean and quiet."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled, It's plain from the outside but when you walk in it is a very modern and clean look. The food is great and cheap. I always get the ham and cheese croissant but you can't go wrong with anything they serve. Super flaky and worth the visit. Not set in the best location but definitely a place worth the stop"}
{"text":"Got myself a cappuccino and mushroom and spinach quiche. This is heavenly. Melts in your mouth. I feel like a rich Beverly hill lady without having to dress up but still enjoy the food and environment. Coming back to try different food. Made fresh every morning"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious pastries and desserts. Come here for breakfast or brunch and leave happy. :) The cafe is also super cute and a great place to chat and drink coffee or even study. I recommend the almond croissant, Nutella brioche, or cinnamon roll. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say how the food was bc it looked good but the guy behind the cash register took the persons order in front of us and rolled his eyes and walked away from us.  After waiting several minutes 3 people behind the counter never acknowledged us.  It's sad because I will never recommend them to my friends.  I am in shock to be treated so poorly.  Bad business plan to have crappy customer service."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time & im very impressed. Good food for good price & the location is off in a quiet corner. Staff is very welcoming"}
{"text":"Café Breizh is home to America's best authentic French croissant. And thanks to Pierre and Jérôme, the genial young Brittany natives who own this wonderful bakery and make every delicacy themselves by hand, Café Breizh offers the finest pastries in Las Vegas, as well. French butter is used for their superb creations, and even the crepes--a Breton specialty--are made with a proper French griddle.  It is clear that Pierre and Jérôme have professional integrity. Dedicated to traditional methods of fabrication, they use time-honored artisanal techniques and understand that the finest ingredients yield noble results. Pastries at Café Breizh are at once light, delicate and deeply satisfying, the best I have eaten in the States. But their croissant is most impressive of all. So often this ubiquitous crescent roll translates into a lump of vaguely stratified dough...: at Café Breizh genuine French croissant is an absolute poem; dozens of light, flaky layers with a rich buttery smell in perfectly browned crackly shells, works of extraordinary skill that only a true French master baker could generate.  My husband and I learned of this new \"patisserie\" from our friend Jacques, a charming French fellow who knows how to live well. Jacques explained that Pierre and Jérôme had been employed at the luxurious Wynn Resort, before deciding to take control of their own destiny. Finally, to valorize the architecturally beautiful pastries neatly arranged under a glass-top counter, Café Breizh is tastefully decorated in fresh, clean whites, which act as a frame for the elegant display. I am very much looking forward to coffee and croissant there in the morning--most highly recommended in every sense!"}
{"text":"Took me back to Paris.  I loved everything about this place.   Food.  Service.  Atmosphere.   I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC!  Beautiful, elegant, sophisticated yet approachable.  So much so, that it almost doesn't belong in the strip mall it's in.  All I can say is GO THERE.  You will be pleasantly surprised and not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite little French shops!     As soon as you enter you are greeted with the warm sweet and savory aromas this cute place has to offer.    Do try their Ham and Cheese Croissant, the Apple Turnover, Chocolate Ganache topped Brownie, Cinnamon Roll, and Crepes.  They have a great variety of savory and sweet.  You can also ask to have your pastries warmed up in the oven!  Oh and don't forget a cup of their delicious coffee or cappuccino.    I want so badly to give them 5+ stars but my only objection is the service and the seating.  we have been coming here since they opened and the experience has since change.  We would order and sit down and your order would be brought out to your table.  Now the only thing they deliver are specialty dishes.   So they call out for coffees, teas and pastries, well the problem with this is there are no names taken so if 5 different tables ordered similar items guess what kind of confusion this causes.  And they also don't tell you they will call out your order so probably not the best system for newcomers.  I have a feeling it's a staffing issue but there are still ways around this, perhaps ask for a name to call out.   The seating is another novelty in this place so be prepared to wait and wait or enjoy your items standing up.   Overall still my favorite French shop, i just hope they can find a more efficient way to provide better service."}
{"text":"This French bakery is truly authentic.  The owner is a true French man with a strong accent. The selection of baked goods is on display and looks amazing. The French macaroons and the tarts are my favorite. Everything i have tried here so far does not disappoint.  Today I had the quiche and it is the best i have ever tried. I highly recommend this delicious bakery."}
{"text":"Ok - this place has crazy good food.  Backpacked in France and this is the good stuff.  Kids want mcd' s for breakfast - no way - \"let's try a new place\".  Just opened in December.  $50 later and multiple trips to the register - quiche is amazing - we had three. Ham and cheese croissant also amazing - we had two of those. ChocolAte croissant- very good. Tiramisu- very good. Salad with the quiche - amazing. Coffee very good - best hot chocolate we have ever had.  We still have to try the crepes!!!!!  Between cafe breizh and baguette cafe my French casual needs are met - life is so good for a foodie in vegas"}
{"text":"Hands down best crepes! Authentic, with sweet and savory ones. Must try at least once! Definitely going back for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, very clean cafe. Nothing overly sweet but tasted amazing. Nice for a quick stop to eat or a little pick me up dessert."}
{"text":"A cute establishment in the West side in a strip mall. The cafe is spotless and modern, the coffee superb (including brewed decaf), and the pastries are to expire for. They serve both sweet and savory crepes (the latter made from traditional French buckwheat) ... all made to order.  Things I didn't like: This place epitomizes unpretentiousness as there's NO decor whatsoever! The few tables and chairs are arranged haphazardly. The beige walls lack decorations, theme, art, etc. consequently there is no ambiance or anything to look at. Additionally the bare walls, ceiling material and flooring all reflect sound. The place is noisy! All conversations reverberate annoyingly.  All that being said, the emporium has huge potential!"}
{"text":"Loved the food! The helpings are huge compared to other places, and the service is wonderful. I would tell anyone to eat breakfast or lunch here."}
{"text":"You know when you're craving something so bad and when you finally get it, you're totally let down. That's me right now.  Came back for the Nutella/strawberry crepe and it wasn't good at all. It was cold. Are they supposed to be cold? Maybe that's traditional? The last time I got it, it was perfect! Not HOT but deff not COLD! This one was legit cold. So cold that the Nutella didn't get a little Melty/creamy. Just cold Nutella on a cold crepe."}
{"text":"Stopped for brunch and totally enjoyed the savory galettes. Then had a great Napoleon. Good spot. Clean and modern."}
{"text":"Space: It has very cute seats and it's very open. There are many seats for people who want to enjoy a nice treat.   Service: Their staff is SO FRIENDLY!! I think they have two head chiefs (one for crepes and one for pastries) and I loved coming here when I came to visit that I stopped by multiple times and even came back to get treats to bring back home.  Price: It is pretty average for pastries. About $5 ish each and less than $10 for crepes depending on the type you get.   Food:  soo delicious! their pastries are not too sweet and have a very nice taste and texture. each dessert looks like It was nicely plated and their interior is so cute!   Notes:  So so so good! Come here to get a friendly staff and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Will never be back.   Terrible and bad service.   Don't waste your money when there are way better bakeries in Vegas."}
{"text":"Thank you to the staff for making great food and mocha. This is my new favorite breakfast spot! It's worth the drive then head up to Red Rock via Charleston. They have these hams and cheese croissants that is soooo savory. The croissant is super flaky and the cheese they put on the croissant adds a crispy topping. I could eat a dozen of these but they are a huge portion. We just tried their cocoa powder covered brownie and my husband won't share. If you are looking for a bakery and cafe this is the place. Everything made there, none packaged."}
{"text":"Strawberry tarte was good, but for $5+ it was a really small slice. Brizh crepe with apples and ice cream was amazing. Would go back just for that. $10 and filled with lots of apple slices, butter, and delicious vanilla ice cream. Wish the scoop of ice cream was very small."}
{"text":"I think I've died and gone to heaven!!! Absolutely the most delicious place in Vegas.  Almond croissants....warm just out of the oven...the BEST!!! Lemon curd crepe...with REAL homemade whipped cream....way better than those I've had in Paris.  If I could give this place a million stars I would.   Service was pleasant...place was simple & clean."}
{"text":"This place deserves more than just 5 stars...it's delicious!! They have a large variety of amazing looking pastries that are unique and scrumptious. And their crepes are out of this world. I got the salmon veggies & chive crepe, and my fiancé got the bacon mushroom & goat cheese crepe. You can tell they use quality ingredients...makes them super tasty & light. Coffee is good too. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"The Cafe Breizh's croissant reminds me exactly of the taste of croissants from Paris. The layers, taste of the butter, crispiness, and density are all perfect!! I also tried Almond croissant. The freshly toasted almonds make the croissant so delicious because of its nutty flavor. However, the Brioche is a little dry. But, the Nutella top and chocolate balls makes for a good combination. I wish I could just take everything to go from here!"}
{"text":"Incredible croissants and muffin (5 stars) but the people don't know how to work their expresso machine (0 stars). So I gave up and just got brewed coffee. I'm in no way a coffee snob but they are really gonna have to figure out how use the machine. The guy couldn't get the expresso holder mounted on to the machine and tried holding it while it brewed resulting in a cup of brown water.......wow!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Pierre and his amazing employees serving up amazing pastries and coffee.. By far the best Cinnamon Rolls and Crossiant that melt in your mouth literally, you have your choice several different flavors. I have never had an Apple turnover that was this good. Definitely highly recommended establishment. Very warm setting and very friendly staff. Literally changed my morning routine. Thank you......"}
{"text":"This place was very aesthetically pleasing. I love how all their pastries are beautifully displayed! The lemon tart was my favorite. I had a vegetarian Crepe and it was kind of bland, it was an unusual filling combination for a savory crêpe, but I thought I would give it a try anyway! It was cooked carrots, celery, and turnips with a tomato reduction. My boyfriend also got the bacon, mushrooms, and goats cheese Crepe and the bacon looked like microwave bacon. I might still go back for another pastry or to try a sweet Crepe though!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Came here this lovely valentine's afternoon with my husband. We ordered a Nutella crepe and a cinnamon roll. Both were yummy and perfect. As we were about to leave one of the chefs came out and served us a slice of strawberry shortcake....no charge. It was the perfect gesture to our short celebration.  Definitely come check them out. Let's keep it local!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious stuff! I haven't tried it all yet, but it sure is my goal, I want to try every item in this cafe. There napoleon is delicious, the serving size is pretty generous, and the cappuccinos are great! Perfect for a quick snack, or even if you're hungry, they got sandwiches and lots of other stuff. Highly recommended if you're into pastry. A+++"}
{"text":"Coffee was disappointing. Latte tasted like water; no coffee smell or taste whatsoever. Came back twice and there was no difference."}
{"text":"This place has the best crepes  I have ever tasted. I I have tried crepes all  over town such as Jean Philippe , tasty crepes even  beats the  French bakery on Sahara!!! I love how The crêpe is thin and that it's not substituted for the other ingredients!!! Their coffee is  pretty strong( I love COFEEE) so this was very important to me!!! . I will definitely be coming back with friends!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the strawberry Nutella crepes. It was delicious, I thought the crepe was a little on the thin side compared to how much toppings where on it. However it was still delicious and I would definitely come back to try again. They had many cute little pastries up in the display."}
{"text":"This place was awful! We ordered an almond croissant, but never received it. Eventually when I went back up there to see what happened to the pastry, they informed me that they had sold their last one and there weren't anymore, but they could bake more which would take half an hour. No thank you. Also, when we received our coffees they were cold!! Don't bother with this place!!"}
{"text":"Best pastry/coffee shop in the Summerlin area. The cinnamon roll is the best...period.  And the croissants are amazing."}
{"text":"Visited for an afternoon snack.  Lots of French possibilities.  Seems authentic.  After a period of deliberation, we chose a savoury option.  Went for the Galette - la tradition with salad.  Cappuccino was in order as well.  Nice little place.  Has wifi - just ask at the front."}
{"text":"I just noticed this place since it is real close to my house. Their ham and cheese croissant are delicious and crispy on top. Next I'm going to try their crepes , if it's anything like the croissants it will be delicious too. It wasn't too expensive either, I will surely try them again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good croissants and pastries, this will be the place! The apple turnovers are sooooo good. They're flaky yet dense with filling. And yes, those are the right color in croissants , not pale af! Their quiches are sooo light and flavorful. You can definitely taste high quality ingredients that they use. Their galettes are super good, cheesy yet not overwhelming. Oh and don't forget to try their iced cafe latte, try with hazelnut syrup Overall, it's a good experience including the service. MUST TRY!!!! and again and again..."}
{"text":"Amazing. Cutest interior design. Kind and talented chef. Best chocolate croissant ever. They'll even warm it up for you which makes it even better. Yummy drink options. I love the sanpellegrino limonata. And the potato leek soup is WOW. Loved every bite including the bread. Big fan of this adorable tasty French cafe."}
{"text":"I don't know what else to say other than EXCEPTIONAL!!!! You can't go wrong with anything you order here."}
{"text":"I have surprised myself by becoming a regular here! I'm not big on sweet pastries but Cafe Breizh has me hooked. From the much-hyped cinnamon roll to the made-to-order crepes and galettes, CB caters to those who eat with their eyes first ...and/or post their food on social media.  SAVORY: The ham and cheese croissant is a treasure, and one I've happily shared with a couple of friends. The salmon and broccoli quiche is a favorite to take and bake at home for later consumption with a salad. The galettes are perfectly cooked and I prefer the mushroom-goat cheese over the salmon-veggie version.   SWEET: Their tarts are beautiful, but the lemon ones are especially tart so it went unfinished at our table. The chocolate chip cookies are perfection with melty chips and a perfect just-baked finish! The cinnamon roll is a take on your traditional flavors but with different ratio of crunchy and spongy bits.   The quality is quickly evident on a visit, but there are a few areas upon which I hope to see improvement as they settle in: the dine-in service can at times be forgetful, but they're wonderful at following up once they're aware of an issue and the interior is a bit plain and cold but they seem to be adding to it bit by bit. I also wish their coffee was a bit better, as I've found it weak on more than one visit. These are admittedly minor things that don't prevent one from being able to enjoy Pierre Gatel's culinary creations."}
{"text":"Quiche & salad made a lovely lunch at a good price. The beautiful pastries lured me back = amazing. The crepes smelled so good I'll be back for them next."}
{"text":"Just a simple casual place for French pastries, a light lunch along with some gourmet coffee. I loved the simplicity of the place. My husband had the chicken bacon sandwich, which was simply beautiful and delicious. Chicken, tomatoes, lettuce in this delicious sauce. I ordered the croque madame which was a ham sandwich with sauce along with gruyere cheese topped with an egg. Omg just delicious!  You place your order and they give you a number for your table. The chef himself brings the food out to you. For dessert we had the cinnamon roll that comes nice and warm for you. Simply delicious is all I can say."}
{"text":"My second visit followed a belated Mothers' Day lunch. My mother-in-law loves her some France. Given that she's been engrossed in preparing for  a trip to France in the fall, I thought pastry and croissants would be the perfect fit.   Sure enough, she selected - and later devoured - a beautiful pan au chocolat.   My husband ordered a slice of cheesecake; repeating his choice from our first visit.   I intended to have another one of those glorious chocolate chip cookies. And I did order one. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that there were still almond croissants in the case. So I got one of those, too. And a plain croissant. And a lemon tart.   Yes, I know. I can't control myself. I'm like Ash Ketchum in a Pokemon store when it comes to pastry cases.  Surprise (not really): everyone loved everything. All three croissants were excellent, even considering they were purchased mid-day. The layers, flakiness, and crunch were exceptional. While the almond croissant was definitely one of the best I've had in town, I always seek more almond flavor.   The chocolate chip cookie didn't have as much chocolate as the first one, but it was still, texture-wise, right up my alley.   When I gather a bit more cash and manage to avoid sweets  and carbs for a bit, I'll be back."}
{"text":"As much as I wanted this place to live completely up to it's hype, it sadly did not. In regards to their food and it's presentation everything was satisfactory but their service is what fell short. In my perspective when I go out to eat I am not only paying for the food itself but for the customer service as well and the price of the food did not match up to the service provided. To be specific I went to Cafe Breizh with two friends and was the first to order, although I was first I was given my food last. Usually this doesn't bother me but it did this time because what I ordered was exactly similar to what my friends had ordered and there was no explanation given as to why this happened. In order to make up for this disservice I was given a free pastry but I am still heavily disappointed and I don't feel a free pastry completely makes up for this as it should have been avoided in the first place. I do believe they can only improve from situations like mine and I truly hope they do so as I did enjoy every other part of my experience."}
{"text":"So glad this place opened!   It's next to my chiropractic office and I get to grab a coffee in the morning with their delicious almond croissant!  So good."}
{"text":"The best! I went there twice in a one day. Love pasties over there. Wish I live around there..."}
{"text":"Spectacular pastries. I love almond croissants and I've tried a lot of almond croissants around town. The texture of Cafe Breizh's almond croissant puts everyone else in shame. Warm, flaky, crunchy outside and perfectly soft inside. It's the ultimate almond croissant. Only drawback is the almond flavor is not as obvious as others. I also tried their cinnamon roll. It is perfect! Napoleon is also good but I've had better. The other two just set the standard too high"}
{"text":"Very cute little cafe! The have a lot of delicious looking pastries displayed and the restaurant is adorable inside. I stopped by after the gym looking for a quick bite. I got the \"la tradition\" galeites which is like a savory crepe. Reminded me of a crepe I had when I was in Europe. :)"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices. Homemade bakery items & entrees. Very clean. Limited seating.  Tried the Napoleon for $6 and it was delicious. All of the quiches looked amazing & I am already planning to go back & try one."}
{"text":"Everything I had here was amazing and delicious. From the coffee to the bakery goods, each item was rich with flavor and those ham and cheese croissants just blew me away. I simply can't wait to try the crepes and galettes next time I visit."}
{"text":"Bar none best one! Taste perfection for yourself. This is French food at it's finest. Keeps me coming back. Couldn't be more grateful for great food outside The Strip."}
{"text":"I honestly can say that this place is the REAL DEAL.. for me forget others!  Everything is so delicious and French Authentic.. the owners are both from France, Specifically from Brittany, France.  This region in France is known for \"Crêpes (sweet) and galettes (savory) are traditional Breton foods\"   (excerpt: http://www.francetravelplanner.com/go/brittany/food_drink/index.html).  Try their Almond Croisant.. omgsh.. heaven..  Their quiche \"Cest Manifique\" and all for a price that is worth it and fair.  Congrats Cafe Breizh!  You made me a believer and a fan!"}
{"text":"This is such a quaint adorable place, I LOVED it. The Nutella brioche is the best and their coffee is perfect. I've also tried the croque monsieur, quiche Lorraine, Nutella crepe, and pain au chocolate (which was just ok to me). I can't wait to come back for coffee and a Nutella brioche!!"}
{"text":"OMFG holy shit this place is so good. Lucky me, a friend bought me a chocolate croissant (they call it pain de chocolat here) and a coffee to pay me back for a favor. Wow THE BEST I've ever had. Everyone at work watched me devour it and looked at it with super jealous stares. No I did not share and no I did not offer. I had to go back a few days later, and in the last two days I've been there twice. =D  The Almond Croissant is even better if you can believe it. They sell out of these sometimes. We got the last one today! But if you don't like sweets too much, stick with the chocolate croissant. The whole inside isn't all chocolate so you get some bites of sweet and some bites of butterly flakey richness. They really are the flakiest croissants I've ever seen and they are so airy and light it's basically eating air, so don't worry about the calories or your waistline. I sure as hell am not!  I'll probably be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Fab cinnamon roll, like everyone else has said. they have a very attentive staff. Very happy I stopped in :)  Crepes are amazing too!"}
{"text":"Wow I have never seen anything like what just happened to me and my BF here just now. We ordered food we're waiting for it to be made then they sold the bread to make our sandwich to someone else and then as that person left they called us up to say sorry they don't have any bread for us. Worst part they did not care or anything, terrible run business and one of the owners stood by making a crepe while this all happened and did not say a word."}
{"text":"My favorite just around the corner from my house. By far the best French cafe in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I came in for first time and tried almond croissant! It tasted great! Very clean inside and good customer service. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Best place ever for crepes! Everything is made from scratch, fresh. Delicious!   Salmon crepes is whoa ! The ham and cheese croisant is orgasmic!   This place is now on top of my list and it's really a must must go in Vegas. Everyone will love it !"}
{"text":"I've only had their cinnamon rolls but they are sooooooo good!!! Flaky and very light. The man who helped me was one of the owners he has as very thick French accent super friendly."}
{"text":"I can't even explain to you how good the pastry is at this bakery. A true display of craft and skill. Literally the best chocolate croissant I have ever had in my life. Warm, gooey, buttery goodness.  You have to eat here. You have to taste this mans magic. It's that good. Seriously."}
{"text":"I had the Capresse and it was amazing! The bread is amazing and it just tasted fresh. I also had the apple turnover to take home and it was really good also! I will definitely be going back, often."}
{"text":"Wonderful French Cafe! The real deal, beautiful and superbly baked goods, friendly staff in a charming little cafe atmosphere. Had the quiche, perfect. Took some pastries home because they look so perfect it's impossible not to. Once you see these beautiful mini works of art, you'll have an entirely new definition of pastry. Must try. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The dining area setup does not look to be the most comfortable for dine-in, but I was doing take out so no problem. My wife said the spinach quiche was very good. I have no opinion on the quiche, but I can definitely say that the apple turnover was beyond delicious. The pastry was flaky and flavorful and had the perfect bit of crispness. The pastry was so good it didn't even need the apple filling, but it was there and added a wonderful flavor to the perfect pastry. I'm glad I don't live closer because if I did I would stop by every morning. The woman who waited on us was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"LOCATION: at a nothing-special strip mall, the Lakes area INSIDE: cold and uninviting, nothing on the walls.   About 7 small, very basic, 2-seater tables, white plastic patio chairs.  FOOD: I tried the La Tradition galette, it was tasty and filling. But, at $9, I don't feel it was worth it.    The experience and the setting is not on par with the pricing. I would prefer La Belle Terre for its ambience and better pricing.  I don't see myself coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"The pastries are ungodly delicious, the galettes are wholly satisfying, and the coffee is La Columbe. I've been here few times, but am only now getting around to writing a review. I ordered a cafe latte and an apple turnover earlier today. The latte is perfect and needs no sugar. I ate the entire apple turnover with my eyes closed. It was so good, I couldn't focus on anything other than the pastry (which also didn't last long either!) Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Looking for a place in LV where you know the owner cares about the details.   Love the vibe.  Food was excellent."}
{"text":"100%  authentique patisserie...  so happy to have stumbled upon! cant wait to try more!"}
{"text":"This place is exquisite. Completely unassuming in a sort of dingy strip mall area in the southwest. Absolutely hidden gem. I love going there for breakfast/lunch. I have been stuck on the same thing each time I've been because it's THAT good, but my companions have branched out and have never been disappointed. So here's what we've had: Croque Madame- grilled ham and cheese that's been dunked in béchamel prior to grilling and then some how there's a perfect magical egg on top. Oh and more cheese. LEGIT. Norwegian Galette- buckwheat crepe with roasted veggies, AMAZING smoked salmon, lemon, and the most delicious herb chive cream. SO EFFIN AMAZING. Peanut Butter Banana Crepe- the crepes are laid flat and then the filling ( in this case delicious peanut butter, gorgeous scallops of banana, and the tastiest crunchy candied peanuts) is laid out beautifully and the round edges folded up to make almost a picture frame. I always take pastries and a baguette when I leave, and they have all been phenomenal. Also the staff is very sweet and attentive. Fantastic place. Delicious food."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical when i walked in and it was kind of empty and quiet, but couldn't resist trying something after checking out the array of beautiful pastries in the display. After splitting a Croque Madame and a Nutella Brioche with a friend I am sold! The brioche was fresh and flaky. The wonderful lady in the front told me they bake it in house. It was perfectly sweet, which for me was not nearly as sweet as it looked. The Croque Madame took longer to cook up, but when it came it was warm with browned, gooey Gruyere cheese all over it.   The food was beyond delicious and I can't wait to come back and get a crepe! The staff was beyond nice and the coffee was some of the best I've had. Highly recommended!  And listening to the hot French chef explain the menu is a big plus."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's usually quiet and the food is always up to par. Real authentic French bakery style. The owner is a Top chef but even though he is new at having his own business he's already doing things right. You can tell the pastries are beautifully crafted and the flavors are amazing. I've been waiting for a place like this for so long and finally it's here right in the neighborhood!! Apparently there will be a nice expansion to the menu once they are comfortable that the system is running smoothly. I like owner operated businesses because you know the quality and consistency won't decline and things will keep getting better. I'm looking forward to many more lunches here. I recommend the #1 galette it's my favorite. I like them all but find myself returning to the #1 most of the time. All the pastries are excellent and every person that I've brought here was impressed. I've noticed some reviews people complained that the place was cold looking well it's a modern style place. When your going for a lunch and spending 10-12 bucks  don't judge the place like your going to a steak house spending 50 per head. Some people have no empathy and never had a business they just don't understand that Rome wasn't built in a day. It's the potential you need to envision."}
{"text":"Best croissants ever!!!! I love the atmosphere of this cafe.  I feel like I stepped in to a cafe in France.  Great food,  coffee, and people! I love the croissant Ham&cheese and the chocolate croissant."}
{"text":"Delicious,l food, beautiful location fit for a wedding, kind and helpful staff, a must return."}
{"text":"You have got to be kidding me with what just happened. I went in there and ordered a sandwich and a crepe, while I was sitting there waiting for them to be made someone one else came in and asked about buying the bread they had available. They had a few minute discussion and then eventually she packed up the bread and sold it to him. As soon as he left she called me up and said sorry I don't have any more bread to make your sandwich with. I asked her how that was possible since someone just walked in and she sold him all their bread, she said sorry but clearly could not have cared less.  I live close by and am French so I liked this place even tho is a bit expensive. After this experience I will never be back. To top it off one of the two owners was standing right there while this all happened and did not say anything or apologize and also seemed like he could care less."}
{"text":"La tradition galette - really tasty, ham (can taste the good quality not like cheap deli meat) delicious cheese and egg made to order Croissant - very moist and chewy but would recommend you ask them to warm it up Opened on July 4th"}
{"text":"I want to be able to give this place a great review. Unfortunately I have been hear and left more times than I have gotten something. The one time I made a purchase, the beautifully presented cinnamon roll turned out to be incredibly dry but flavorful.   The space itself is sparse and feels a bit cold. Despite passing by here regularly, it also took me a minute to find because their sign inexplicably is not lit at night and they do not have any clear open sign. The first time I finally found it was in the evening and I ended up not going in because they did appear to be open despite the lights inside being on (no one was visible inside). Same story the next time I went by, but decided to check and the person running it immediately came out from the back when I walked in the door.  On two subsequent visits during the day, I received less the positive customer service and ended up walking out both times without making my intended purchases. Both times I was not acknowledge at all when I first walked in. The first time there were two people working and both were busy doing things despite the place not being very busy. After standing around for a bit, one of the employees said he would be with me in a second as he walked by. Once I saw him starting to work on building some espresso drink after passing me repeatedly, I finally just left. The second time that same employee was clearly grabbing good to deliver to a table, so I waited until he had delivered the food thinking he would assist me when done. Instead he again kept walking past me and said be with you in a second during one of the passes as I had experienced the first time. When additional customers came in, it still did not seem to prompt any interest in stopping to assist me. In this visit, they must have had a very busy day as well since they only had a fraction of the normal options. Realizing I still was not going to be served again, I left.   I desperately want to give this place a chance because everything looks tasty, but it's hard we I have been barely acknowledged as a customer twice."}
{"text":"First timers!!! The almond croissant was AMAZING! The crock monsieur was a little soggy, but still great.   The reason I'm only giving 3 stars is for the service and cheeky upswell.   We walked in, we're greeted right away and ordered. We order the almond croissant, crock monsieur and a coffee. She asked if we would like the croissant warmed up, ouuu yes! Sounds delicious! She also asked if we wanted a salad with the crock monsieur. I asked if it came with it and she said no, by its only $1.50, so I said sure. We went and sat outside and waited there... my husband finally went it to see if we could just grab the coffee and it was just sitting on the counter, along with our \"warm\" croissant. Well, our coffee was not hot and the croissant was not warm. Anyways, my husband goes back in to ask for 2 forks so we could share our croissant. She only gave him one set of utensils and said she would bring the other with the crock monsieur... why?! I don't know. She brings out our salad and crock monsieur with the other set of utensils. The salad is literally romaine lettuce with some type of mayo dressing. Definitely not a delicious salad, also just felt like that was a cheeky move to upswell me this so called salad."}
{"text":"Love it and highly recommended!  Great customer service amazing pastries, cookies and other sweets...  I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I would recommend this to anyone who likes French Crepes and French Pastry very clean and the food is excellent"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place I have tried the crepes, croissants, and the quiche and they are all delicious.  Everything is so fresh and the croissants literally melt in your mouth.  This is my second time coming here and every time I am in Las Vegas I stop in.  My suggestion is go early not late because the selection is slim toward the evening.  Prices are appropriate for the quality of food you are getting.   The salmon broccoli quiche is amazing and the peanut butter crepe with bananas YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"The crepe was delish. It was made and prepared not in a hurry so it really looks good as it tastes. Place was clean and gorgeous I took some pastries to go tooo and they were great"}
{"text":"Wow!  Sit down when you eat the cinnamon rolls or your legs will go weak from the cloud-like fluffiness of the pastry. Buttery, cinnamon-nie, light, and warm from the oven. My friends had the almond croissant and the ever so simple and fabulous \"plain\" croissant. Went perfect with their latte and cappuccino.   An amazing find!"}
{"text":"The Napaleon is one of the best to try here. It's excellent and the coffee is pretty good as well. I really like this place"}
{"text":"Really nice and clean place as a bakery.  Fast service and food was so fresh and tasty. Sandwich was very Rich in flavor.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I haven't had the pleasure of partaking in their beautiful looking crepes just yet, but I'm a big fan of their chocolate chip cookies! They taste like what I thought the chocolate chip cookies at Milk Bar would taste like (not a knock at all on Milk Bar, but their concrete cookie was just not my cup of tea, but I do love their other ones!). My husband is a big fan of their chocolate croissants (Pain au Chocolat), which he paired with vanilla ice cream at home.   The space itself is pretty immaculate and kept clean at all hours. They can run out of a few select items, so get there early if you can. I was actually referred to this cafe by another Las Vegas gem, Chef John of Soho, who knows about great customer service and high quality food. This isn't exactly an area where chic French bakery comes to mind (trust me, I used to live in the apartments across the street where we shared walls with a Jersey Shore-esque couple with a tumultuous relationship, filled with drug deals, loud sex, and restraining orders), but this place is another Vegas standout that is worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have to agree with one of the previous reviews when he said don't walk, run... better yet, drive because it's faster. I've never been to France, but I have eaten at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant at the Paris Hotel on the Las Vegas strip. Just like I could taste the difference there, you will definitely be able to taste the difference in the care they've put into making their pastries at this café. I could taste every ingredient. There were no artificial tasting flavors. They were soft and freshly made, not stale. Simple, yet amazing flavors when you bite into them. My new favorite!"}
{"text":"My experience was just that an experience. This place is new and you can tell while your there. The service is a little slow because they are working out their kinds but there products more than make up for it.   I treated my mother out to a coffee and some sweets because I'm a good son (jk). I ordered the #3 gallete (sp?) had asked if I could get it with any other cheese because I really don't like goat cheese after the cashier ran back 3 times to ask the chef he allowed it and it was literally amazing. There's something about gruyere and not many places using it that really makes it so good when you get it,   My mother ordered a macchiato and to her dismay she received a real macchiato and not what Starbucks brands as a sugary death trap. She was a little upset until I explained to her it was correct and she should have asked if it was American style. But she really enjoyed the flavor and just wished there was more beverage. I told her next time to get a cappuccino dry. She also got the ham and cheese croissant and it made up for all the issues with her drink.   The only cons I noticed were the tables being kind of on top of each other so if it was actually packed you would have no privacy.  The other major con was they have no real cups that we saw. I hate drinking out of paper and plastic if I'm staying. It's not classy and it's actually cheaper to rewash cups.   All in all I have my eyes on that tiramisu.   Someone tell me if it's as good as it looks.   Update: the blueberry muffin looked a lot better than it tasted. It was too mushy on the inside and the blueberries were too sour. It's like they didn't get good ones. Also the plastic wrapper was fused to it so I had to like scraps out the bottom. But it looked so pretty."}
{"text":"My go-to Parisian brunch place: clean, bright and the pastries/galettes were delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic French bakery.  My wife ate her way through Paris and said this food was just like it was there, a taste of Paris in Vegas.  The crossaint cinnamon rolls were delectable. And the vegetarienne gallette was savory and delicious.  The cafe mocha was not too sweet with a hint of chocolate the was not overbearing.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants the French bakery experience in the Nevada desert."}
{"text":"I am blown away! Speechless! This is the best bakery I have ever seen in my life. The best desserts and crepes in town."}
{"text":"AMAZINGGG!!! The food is sooo bomb. I honestly want to try everything on the menu. We got a few pastries to-go that I haven't tried yet, but the La Norvegienne was tasty! The salmon tasted smoked but is baked all the way through and the chives cream melted in my mouth.   The service we received was very lovely. I didn't get his name but the person who helped taught us about the different ingredients that made the savory and sweet crepe different. He seemed like he was proud of everything they served there. He was also very attentive and served us, even though it's more of a self serve kind of place.   Definitely would recommend this place. Although it is a little bit on the expensive side, I would like to come back very soon!"}
{"text":"This cafe is amazing!! A must if you enjoy French coffee, pastries & crepes. The two chefs are kind & obviously love what they do. Their croissants are on par with du Pain et des Idees in Paris."}
{"text":"Excellent Croissants and pastries. It provides a clean and warm atmosphere. They gotta fix the open refrigerator though. It makes a loud noise when it reboots."}
{"text":"Cafe was spacious. Greeted by this lovely lady. Pastries was yummy. Did not get the chance to view anything else. Was in a hurry. Next time perhaps."}
{"text":"Cafe Breizh has an assortment of gluten free pastries but mainly known for their savory and sweet crepes.  I have tried their caramel latte and gluten free cinnamon roll. Unfortunately, the cinnamon roll was cold and hard to cut into. But I did enjoy the caramel latte very much.   The employees were quite pleasant and quick to doing my order as well. I asked how the crepes were and the lovely employee named Alexis explained that the crepes were folded like a large square and quite delicious. I figured that I would order one on my next visit because it looked like too much for me to finish on my own.  I do find that this cafe is fairly quiet and probably a good place to get some studying done. The simple, white clean lines of the interior complimented the cafe's theme and products."}
{"text":"Baguettes and various pastry are the best in town IMO. Their buckwheat gallette with bacon, goat cheese and mushrooms is a treasure.   It can get a little crazy on weekends but it's literally only because people just stay to sit and eat forever : ) True French spot! But that's easily fixed by arriving early for breakfast as they open ah 7!   I've loved everything I've ordered and I'm excited to eat their baguettes every weekend til I die."}
{"text":"WOW! Very impressed ! Everything not only looks amazing but it also tastes exactly as it should ! Believe me, i have some experience with French pastry (i am French). Pick anything, quiche, crepes, coffee and any danish and you will know what pastries taste like in France ! Service is quick and team is really kind. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND QUALITY , hope you open a location in Henderson soon....Thank you !"}
{"text":"We were on our way to check out Red Rock Canyon and wanted to have breakfast away from the strip.  Hopped on Yelp and came across this little hidden gem of a restaurant.  We walked into the location and our eyes were greeted with a wonderful selection of pastries and treats.  The menu board had a great selection of breakfast items and we had the omelette.  Fantastic taste, fresh ingredients and didn't taste eggy.  I would highly recommend this location if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"C'est magnifique! I had the spinach mushroom quiche with a side salad and Macchiato...Oh la la! I've been to many French cafes in town and this by far is the best quiche I've had!  Of course, couldn't resist la patisserie to go. The Apple pie, cinnamon roll, almond croissant and pain au chocolat? Omgggg Divine. I want it all!  Finally got to try a can of La Colombo cold pressed vanilla Draft latte. Didn't realize it was lactose free. Now I want a case of it. I'm a coffee 'snob', so seeing The Gibraltar and Cortado on the cafe menu made this place extra special. Had the Gibraltar to go last time I was here. When I ordered my Macchiato the other week, the nice gentleman kindly noted how he makes it, the traditional way. I said perfect, I don't like coffee at Starbucks. lol   Dine in or take out, Online orders available for delivery or pick up too. There goes my diet!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Stopped here on our way from RedRock to San Diego. The food was unbelievably good.  The croissants were fantastic. What a gem. I can hardly wait to go back. Everything is freshly made. The fruits were fresh. Please move to San Diego. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Cafe Breizh is amazing. We visited on the way out of Vegas for breakfast and couldn't be happier with the choice. The galettes were exactly what we needed, and their oatmeal raisin cookie was the perfect snack.  In addition to the food being a great start to the day, the staff was really helpful, and walked us through the differences between galettes and crepes, and made fantastic recommendations."}
{"text":"It's a great place to come and grab a cup of coffee or simply discuss business upon colleagues, study upon your work or school related time with a delicious Omelettes from thier menu, furthermore this place has the closure you've been wondering about this whole time. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Second time visiting this cafe and love it!! I had a savory crepe once and an other time a sweet one. Best croissant in town! Excellent cafe! French music playing. A must in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I went in on Mothers day. They have so many french pastries to choose from I couldn't decide what to get. Since it was lunch time I figured I get a Waldorf salad sandwich for my \"real food\" before the dessert. OMG! AMAAAAAZING! It was so good I was eating fast because I didn't want my husband to keep picking off my plate \"to taste a little bit\" I asked him if he wanted his own but of course he said no. Lol The chicken, the grapes,the walnuts, on a bed of lettuce just chillen on a fluffy cloud of croissant. May I say more? For dessert, I had a croissant which I loved and an almond croissant which I loved even more. They also gave me a Rose as a gift for mother's day. That made my day. And my tummy happy!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little cafe! The owners are so kind and the food is fantastic! What a great little gem in our neck of the woods! I tried the crepe with roasted pineapple and also purchased some almond croissants! To die for! It takes alot for me not to go in everyday and eat here! Yummy! Please lets keep this beautiful little place open! Keep going!"}
{"text":"This place is a beautiful new addition to the southwest area. I truly enjoyed my visit. The staff is friendly and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Love love LOVED this cute little place! I enjoyed the salmon & broccoli quiche, lemon tart, and blueberry muffin and I definitely want to go back for more. Two of my friends who accompanied me had the croque madame and that was amazing as well ( I swiped a piece of theirs!). Highly recommended for brunch or just to stop by and grab a pastry or two... or three!"}
{"text":"While the food here is actually delicious,  I have to give 2 stars because the service is quite poor.  During this last visit,  I thought it would be a quick in and out considering all I wanted was a warmed up croissant.  Had I known it was going to take 20 minutes, I would have left and gone somewhere else.  They are either just really slow or understaffed and for what I have to pay for simple pastries, I would expect better service.  By the time I got my \"warmed up\" croissant, it was cold."}
{"text":"We love this Cafe!! The best ever sweets  Brownie and eclaire beyond of everything! Our favorites)) And birthday cake for our Little One was amazing!!"}
{"text":"I just discovered this cafe today. Their pastries are divine. It reminds me of places that I have been to in Europe. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Cafe Breizh is a small cafe with a limited non bakery menu. During our visit there was only one person taking orders which added to the wait time. We ordered a plain croissant and the La Norvegienne Galette. After placing the order at the counter we received a number and seated ourselves. Seating comfort could be improved with cushioned chairs.  The Gallette was delivered after a short wait but not the croissant which I thought was strange since the Galette was made to order and the croissant was off the shelf and not even warmed up. After several minutes I returned to the counter and asked about the croissant and was told it would be right out. I don't if they forgot or what?  The croissant was good but nothing special. However, the Galette with smoked salmon, sauteed vegetables (carrots, onions and celery) topped with creme chive was delicious. The salmon was juicy and nicely smoked and the vegetables were tender. I would award four stars if the service was improved."}
{"text":"My initial reaction when I saw them bring out the crepes was HOLY CREPE! The crepes here are freakin humongous!   I tried both the sweet and savory ones. My wife got the traditional galette with egg, ham, and cheese. The presentation was unbelievable! It almost looked like a starfish from the ventral point of view (sorry for that biology remark). It has a really strong taste to it. I don't know if it's the ham or the cheese or a combination of both, but even my wife said it reminded her of cat food (not that she's ever tasted cat food lol but in reference to its smell). I got the nutella crepe with strawberries. It was, hands down, the best crepe I've ever had. I liked how it wasn't too soft/soggy, and it had a nice touch of crispy to it. And drizzled with nutella, how can you go wrong?   We also tried their blueberry muffin and chocolate chip cookie. The muffin was shaped like a mushroom with a ridiculously large head, but I liked how crisp it was. The cookie was also really tasty. I enjoyed the generous amount of dark chocolate chunks and just how soft it was.   I've never really been a huge fan of crepes but thank you to my wife for bringing me here and introducing me to this place. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"From the outside you don't think much of it until you walk in and the sweet smell of pastries and assorted treats hit your nose. The clean white simplistic setting helps to draw your eyes to these colorful macaroons, tarts that's are truly gorgeous and taste devine. Then as your eye continues to look you see pastries that are mesmerizing you don't want to touch due to how perfect they look so delicate but most importantly the taste is everything you would want in something so simple as a croissant which is light, buttery, and flakey. I highly recommend trying it out! Coffee does not lack at all if you enjoy a great cup of java. The prices are more than reasonable for the quality of food as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful pastries, I mean amazing!  And crepes are delicious too.  Staff is extremely friendly, and the ambiance -- stellar!  We sat outside in the dog friendly patio with our pups, listening to French music and with flowers on our table.  It felt like we were back in France. Almond croissant is a must, and the Nutella brioche is on my list for next time.  It looked so yummy!  Definitely will be regulars here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Very clean interior and beautiful displays of pastries. Service was quick for fresh parties but took about 15 minutes for my galette. I'm not complaining as I know they're making it as ordered, but if you're in a time crunch I might just get a pastry and bounce. I went with the traditional galette which came with turkey ham egg and an over easy egg. Huge portion. Although the crepe was very thin it was a perfect portion size for lunch. Tasty and authentic. Just the look of it alone was enough for a 5 star review as the preparation was obviously on point. I sat outside but they also have about 10 tables inside to enjoy lunch. There were only about 2 or 3 groups eating at noon during the week so I hope they get more business as they have some great food here. Will be coming back for the pastries and coffee for sure in the future."}
{"text":"Actually i tried couple of things.All of them were amazing.But i love Lorainne.You need to try for sure.Visit one time and you will love it.And the service was excellent.Everything fresh and healthy.Great job guys"}
{"text":"This was our 1st time here,  20 mins drive, but food was very tasty and everyone was super friendly.. plus... fresh whipped cream!! we will  definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So I've been in a lot of French bakery in Vegas and I can tell this one is actually the BEST ONE in town! The pastries and the croissants are the best ones I ever had, they're exactly the same as the one you can find in a really good bakery in France!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best crepe place I've tried so far in Las Vegas.   I think Cafe Breizh (pronunciation... help me out?? ) only opened recently because what used to be in its place was Three Kings Hookah lounge, if I remember correctly.  They have savory crepes, sweet crepes, and a nice variety of bakery goods!  Super tasty!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Hidden gem.  You guys have to come and try this place.  Everything we ordered was beyond delicious.  And everyone who came in and dined in, everything they ordered .... every plate that came out of their black swinging doors... was a beauty. Not only a beauty but also looked delicious.  I cannot wait to come back.  I wanted to stay all day and try everything.  Everything is fresh, made to order.     We ordered:  Croque Madame:  Toast, gruyere, bechamel, ham, and egg.  Almond croissant: layers upon layers of delicately almond filled goodness.   Nutella brioche : light and airy brioche with Nutella attractively smothered on top with tiny dainty Krispy chocolate balls decorated on top.   Cortado: 2 espresso shots with a little frothed milk.   Option to have it sweetened and flavored.   I chose Vanilla.    I felt like I was in France. Never been (^-^)/ but I sure felt like I was there.  I cannot wait to come back... I think I said that already but .... butttttttt seriously.  So good.  I will be returning to pick up a few treats for our office.   * Also, bathrooms are clean"}
{"text":"Amazing place. A little bit of France in Spring Valley. How lucky are we you opened up. Pastries are fantastic as is everything else. Staff friendly and kind"}
{"text":"Cafe Breizh is far and away the best bakery I've experienced in Las Vegas.  It is one of the better bakeries I've experienced anywhere actually.    Everything I've tried is exceptionally good.  Amazing croissants and cinnamon rolls.  Fabulous almond croissants.  The pain au chocolate is quite good.  The pastry desserts and macarons are incredible.  You really can't go wrong here.  The crepes and quiches are also worth a visit.  The croque monsieur is my favorite of the savory items.  As far as drinks, they brew La Colombe coffee & espresso here.  Their coffee is excellent-- Cafe Breizh is a solid coffee destination.  The small space is really bright, warm, and inviting.  There is a little patio space in addition to the dining room area.  My one complaint is the service.  The cashiers here are unpolished and can be unprofessional at times.  For example, today I had to repeat my order three times to the cashier and then a fourth time several minutes later to the person who boxed up my pastries.  Cafe Breizh is a must visit-- definitely a Las Vegas food and coffee destination."}
{"text":"Delicious pastry and coffee selection."}
{"text":"An adorable - hidden posh little treasure!!!  Very small and tucked away in a tiny strip mall off Ft Apache!  Crepes are plenty and delish!    Staff are friendly & service was fast!  Downside:  location... this is not in a nice neighborhood.  Fantastic little idea & great hopes for this little business they just need a better location to really grow."}
{"text":"You won't find more beautiful, artistic, well crafted pastries anywhere off the Strip. The pain chocolat is a work of art with its twisting dough wrapped around itself so perfectly, creating a delicate shell that cracked under the slightest pressure. Their cinnamon roll might be the most refined one in town. Its crisp, thin exterior and chewy interior combine perfectly with each bite. You really can't go wrong with any of their items... the chocolate chip cookie, almond croissant, pumpkin cheesecake, raspberry tart... their all good and prices are more than reasonable. While their selection may not be as diverse as other bakeries, I can only imagine that the menu will expand as they find their footing."}
{"text":"This is the best pastry cafe in town hands down. From the blueberry muffins ( my fave) to the ham and cheese croissants to the crepes ........   & fruit tarts everything is amazing! The ambiance is very simple & clean, the staff is super nice what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place is a heaven I went on the weekend and I purchased the napoleon and a french baguette and pain au chocolat . They were so good ! I highly recommended this place to people who love french pastries like me .  PS: I hope the chef start make some pistachio rolls"}
{"text":"Holy Cow!!!!! Hands down the best French bakery I have ever been to and I have been to quite a few. We have tried almost everything on the menu and in the case and everything has been amazing. The cinnamon roll and the blueberry muffin are my favorite and the croissants are perfection.. staff is very helpful and attentive.. very clean and simple set up absolutely LOVE it!! I will be forced to do extra workouts to keep coming to this place but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Come here for an authentic taste of Brittany!  The partners/owner are both born in Brittany, or Breizh as it is known in the local Breton language. Their specialty addition to the project is the authentic Bretagne galettes.  My friend and I came here around 2.45pm today. We noticed the place is airy, spotless, and bright with some seatings outside. We love the french music. I feel like I stepped in to a cafe in France.   This is an order at the register, then seat yourself kinda place. The French gentleman/chef is welcoming and friendly.   My friend ordered Nutella Crepe which was very delicious and I got the Breizh, also tasty and very sweet. The presentation were beautiful. Also, I tried the Almond croissants which was buttery and flaky, and perfectly glazed and  the Blueberry muffin was loaded with blueberries.  The price has gone up from what I saw online. Just a little pricey for me but worth it."}
{"text":"A real masterpiece if you are looking for a little bit of Paris in Vegas. Cafe Breizh brings authentic French classics from pastries to crepes, croissants to sandwiches and some amazing French bread. Staff are very friendly and the Chef/Owner was very helpful in choosing a variety of French classics for our first time there. Try the quiche, it's delicious"}
{"text":"Cafe Briezh is the latest of off-strip French Patisseries to open in the Vegas Valley. Chef owner Pierre Gatel formerly of Wynn and Jerome Marchand are putting out some of the tastiest bites in town!  You can instantly notice the skill, passion, and details in each item they offer, and you most definitely can taste the quality here. No shortcuts, only the best ingredients used, no exceptions.  We ordered a Traditional Galette and a few breakfast pastries to share. The Traditional Galette-Buckwheat Crepe, Ham, Gruyere, and Sunnyside Egg was straight up perfection , the Ham and Cheese Croissant is a MUST, the plain Croissant was simplicity at its finest, the Almond Croissant and Apple Turnover are just as great(if not, better) as the versions being served at Rosalie in the Southwest.  Definitely off to a great start and barely just 2 weeks opened, Cafe Breizh is definitely going to be a frequent stop!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Brought home a little bit of everything for the family and everyone loved it. They're still raving about it as I'm typing. Everything there is made from scratch . Even the coffee is out of this world. 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I had been here several times before and always had a great experience, but my most recent visit changed my mind. I was SO excited to finally try the Nutella brioche, which is usually sold out.  But when I bit into the brioche, no Nutella! I asked the server why, and apparently they ran out of Nutella today and it was a \"brown sugar\" brioche. Why didn't she say anything when I ordered it?! I asked for some jam or butter on the side, and was told it would be extra. The brioche was very dry, I am very disappointed. Not sure if I will be back again."}
{"text":"My wife had a questions for the staff but they didnt seem sure what they're selling. We ordered the banana strawberry nutella crepe. Presentation is good but serving portion leaves a lot to be desired. We may try it again in the future but not too soon."}
{"text":"I ordered a brownie and it was phenomenal. I loved the chocolate he used and it melts in the mouth. The cafe itself was clean and dainty."}
{"text":"I love this place and literally have been here 20+ times. This place is owned by an authentic French pastry chef so you know it's gonna be good. They have a consistent menu which has some really delicious pastries including my favorites the Apple Turnover, Blueberry Muffin, Pain au Chocolate, and Chocolate Eclair.   Their drinks are quality and I've had their savory salmon crepe one time which was good.  One thing I would change is to add more seating outdoors since it's usually pretty limited. Another thing I would add is to include some seasonal menu items or add some new pastries to the menu. I have a nut allergy and would love to try the brownie but they only serve it with nuts."}
{"text":"Great attention to detail. Taste is spot on. Meticulously prepared. Comprable to those fancy strip bakeries... maybe even  better."}
{"text":"This cafe has the best French pastries I have ever had in Vegas. I absolutely loved the pain au chocolat, it tasted just like it did when I was in France. The atmosphere over all is great, there is French music and a cute dining area. I will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"So let me first say that my veggie crepe tasted better than it looked- I was concerned when it came w tiny cubes of carrots & celery. It was delicious; but I probably wouldn't order it again -  mostly because crepes are pretty fattening & I would rather have them for dessert.   Dessert crêpe was scrumptious- caramel, an ice cream to die for, whipped cream, apples! YUM! Their coffee latte is delicious and they do have almond milk as an option, which I appreciate. I had an almond croissant and honestly I took one bite and didn't want anymore - it wasn't great. My friend liked it- I have tasted way better.  It is definitely a place worth trying out for the pastries and desserts. They have quiche, which my friend said was great - I try not to eat eggs - for the terrible way that we treat chickens at farms.   I asked for lemon for my water and they almost didn't give it to me (saying we don't do that here) and then bringing me very paper thin slices even though my friend got big wedges of lemon for her fish. Not a great customer service moment- the food isn't cheap!  Do try it! Especially the dessert crepe!"}
{"text":"The hardest part about coming here was trying not too order everything under the glass.  Real French food.  Amazing, I will be back very soon, maybe for lunch today."}
{"text":"Words can't even begin to describe how yummy this place is. It is on the expensive side but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Came in after a night of drinking. The quiche and blueberry muffin hit the spot. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is my favorite French pastry cafe.  Everything is so fresh and tasty.  I can't wait to come back next week."}
{"text":"My anticipated first visit was delightful, I ordered a ham and cheese croissant and an apple turn over.. when I got home I bit into my ham and cheese and to a wonderful mistake they gave me a chocolate croissant! (My initial craving when I went in) Like a ACTUAL chocolate croissant they stuffed the inside with gooey chocolate and the outside was flaky and buttery.. most places drizzle chocolate on top and expect you not care.. thanks for the delicious pastries"}
{"text":"The pastries are work of art here, for me the best pastries in Vegas. The only thing I would suggest to warm up the ambiance with some \"French touch\" paintings on the wall."}
{"text":"Nice cozy cafe with quality food. This place is very cute and is a nice place to stop by. I had the tiramisu and the cake was very moist with a light frosting. My boyfriend had the apple turnover and it was very warm and flaky. To drink we had the cappuccino which was very nice the froth was nice and thick and the coffee wasn't too strong. I'd definitely come here for breakfast or a small dessert."}
{"text":"Amazing new French bakery recently opened in my neighborhood. Authentic down to the French pastry chef owners.  I have not tried the crepes yet but the pastries are amazing. I plan to get through their whole menu over the Summer."}
{"text":"Their pastries and sweets are high quality and delicate. Especially their croissant is the best one in Vegas in my opinion!!! Flavorful and moist inside and delicate and thin layers of outside are best combination. If you take it out to home, toasts it in a toaster before eating. It makes you feel heaven."}
{"text":"Hands down the best croissants I've had in the US, let alone Vegas!!! Baguettes are phenomenal too and just $2.50.. also highly recommend their hot chocolate, it's just the perfect amount of cocoa, sweet, and creaminess  Everything else looks really good too, and i am looking forward to trying everything on the menu, that is, the day i can say no to their ! This cafe is as authentic French as it can get, with just the right amount of items on the menu to keep everything quality controlled and excellent! It's a gem of a café in Vegas, and totally worth driving to the other side of town for!"}
{"text":"I didn't think this place could get any better but, today, it happened. I stopped in to grab an apple turnover for dessert (one of the few things I haven't tried yet) and saw beautiful baguettes in the background that I hadn't seen before. I knew I had to try one at the very first glance. The pastry chef said they began to make them this week so lucky me! I just sliced into it and it is scrumptious! It's a perfect French baguette. I love this place even more now."}
{"text":"Stopped by & picked up a tiramisu- chocolate chip cookie & a blueberry muffin... so so yummy!!"}
{"text":"I stopped at Cafe Breizh for the first time and it was OK, not A-OK.  It had been a bookmark for quite awhile and Saturday morning seemed like a good time.  I was ready to order and got out two words when the young woman taking my order interrupted and said she was sorry but she'd be right back.It took her five minutes--perhaps longer--before she came back to the take my order.  During the time, she was packing take out boxes and I waited.  I ordered a galette, the Chevrotine and a cappuccino for eating there and a Nutella brioche to take out.  She gave me a table sign with a number so they would know where to bring the breakfast.  Then I waited.  It was between 20 and 25 minutes before my galette was brought to the table.  By then I was a bit irritated for the wait.  There were a number of staff there but they just couldn't do the take out orders and the in house orders in a timely fashion.    The galette arrived and I still had not received my coffee.  Then I realized it was get your own from the counter when they placed it on the glass and call your name.  You need to develop a teacher's voice so people can hear you.  I retrieved my cappuccino and was finally ready to begin what turned into a frustrating breakfast.  The galette was made with mushrooms, bacon, and goat cheese.  It was OK.  I would have preferred the bacon to be in smaller pieces than whole slices but it was OK.  I brought the Nutella brioche home and had it later.  This was a one and done experience for me.  The service is so slow and the price point for the three items was high."}
{"text":"Excellent croissants, superbes crepes like in Britany France, fluffy apple turnovers. Nice, warm welcome Clean and spacious  Not to be missed"}
{"text":"Very nice cafe. The cakes look and taste amazing. Their coffee taste great.  \" La Colombe \" is the brand of the coffee. I highly recommend to try the crepes as well . Both owner are very friendly and welcoming \" Pierre & Jerome \". Definitely a place to try and come back !!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious crepes and the owner was so nice and patient explaining all of the items they offer to my mom!"}
{"text":"Portion size is unreal, food was made fresh and delicious.   Add this to your Vegas favorites."}
{"text":"Pastries are fine.  Ham & cheese croissant is excellent. Crepes leave a lot to be desired. The galettes are oily and not well filled. I won't return for crepes or galettes."}
{"text":"Update: came back the next day for a blueberry muffin and ham & cheese crossiant . The muffin was the best ive ever had."}
{"text":"Very cute cafe! I got chocolate croissant. I think they had best croissant in Vegas.  I have to try hum and cheese croissant next time"}
{"text":"I was really hoping for a great experience here.  I'm extremely disappointed to report that just the opposite was the case. Upon walking it to this small establishment, you are greeted with white walls, white table and chairs and a bright interior.   We ordered coffee and each had a pastry.  The pastry was very good as was the coffee.   As we sat at the table, we quickly noticed that every white chair, including those that we were sitting on was filthy!  The tile floor looked like it's never been cleaned since this place opened, one year ago.  It had huge amounts of food on the floor including wet food that fell off of the diners plates.  It was truly disgusting!  I then noticed that every empty table top was clearly dirty and each had its own scattered food debris.  The clothing of the cashier and other visible worker, once white, was clearly in need of washing.  The white walls were totally scuffed and very dirty both at the counter as well as the entire interior of this filthy, poorly managed and poorly maintained food establishment. Even the counter where you pick up your food had coffee rings on it and was not clean.  The place was not busy and the help, if propertly trained, should have been cleaning and maintaining the business.  It shows that they are not interesed or caring about keeping the place clean. They have a small outside dining area; yes, this too was filthy and shows lack of total cleanliness throughout. This is too bad because the food is very good but the disgusting filth will make sure I won't return.  I'm surprised that the Board of Health has not shut this place down! Can't wait to see them featured on \"Dirty Dining\". It's just a matter of time. This is a clear example of an excellent chef and baker that does not have a clue or propertly trained staff, as to how to operate a restaurant! If this is the filth that the customer can see in the front of the house, I can't imagine the disaster in the kitchen.  I don't want to know.  I won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"Been there couple times but last night was Mardi Gras and a special occasion to taste the crêpes from a special French bakery. Special event organize by a magazine and the crepes were excellent. The also have a vegetarian crepe. Always have a great time there. I mostly buy for my friend since I am a Vegan an do not eat any dairy."}
{"text":"Had the lemon crepes and they were light airy and delicious, best I've had in vegas for sure. I have also tried the quiches of which the salmon and broccoli is my favorite. Dining in is the best option here as I have tried take out and the process by which they do take out seemed slightly disorganized. All in all it's a cool quaint  casual spot for an informal good meal. Made me feel like I was back in Paris. Love the fact that it's local and close to my residence. Will definitely be back to try all the vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I was shopping at the adjacent Dollar Tree and saw the review of this place and decided to check it out. I originally planned to grab a coffee to go but once I got an eyeful of those yummy pastries, I couldn't leave without also buying a chocolate chip cookie. This little bakery looks like it was transplanted directly from the streets of Paris. Its white color scheme and appealing treat display is as pretty as their food is tasty. I purchased a cappuccino to go and a chocolate chip cookie, and both were of a very high quality. There were a few savory items that looked really good so I'll come back when it's time to blow my low carb diet (again)."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!  Their quiche and crepes are so good. I even love their pastries. I even adore their packaging. Little things like that make me smile.  The only flaw I saw was that only some of the staff workers needed to work fast because the traffic is constant.  I should of asked the guys name, but he had glasses. He is such an awesome worker. He's attentive and fast. He knows what he's doing!  Overall, I highly recommend this cute lil French breakfast and brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Things I ordered: -Croissant with egg, ham and cheese -macarons: brown(salted caramel) and red (raspberry) -lemon tarte -caesar salad -passion fruit ice tea -hot mocha Total came out to be $35   We chose this place because it is literally in walking distance from my house. There is free wifi and a patio as well. This place is very nice both exterior and interior. It is usually pretty empty so it's perfect for a study date as well. There are plenty of seats but they are more of couple seats than a big table. Im sure you can move the tables around. Im sure it is also pet-friendly since there is a patio. Everything is freshly made as well.    The croissant was delicious. I've never had such delicious and fluffy egg. It had a nice crunch to it as well and super soft on the inside.   The salad was very fresh. I'm not a fan of salad but I enjoyed taking a bite into their salad.   Hands down, I think this place has won me with macarons. The macarons are not incredibly sweet at all. It has the perfect amount of sugar to it. The salted caramel is my favorite! Reminds me of my favorite beverly hills macarons all the way in California. I only wish they had more variety of flavors. I believe there's only 5 or 6 right now. Hopefully this business picks up and gets busier so that they can start expanding their menu.   Lemon tarte was my least favorite. I actually think it was just too sour for me and I a couldn't handle it. I wish it was just a little bit more sugary or a lot less sour. Who knows? Maybe I am just not use to the taste of lemon tarte?   The hot mocha wasn't for me but mybrother said he loved it! I tried it but it was too bitter. Im not a coffee fan though.    The passion fruit was also just an okay drink. I thought it was going to taste like starbucks or coffeebean passion fruit. Its actually just passionfruit tea with no sugar or anything different to make it taste different. I would still order it when I'm thirsty since it does taste fresh and not made 10 days ago like most places.   There's also a water station in the back for those who don't want to spend on drinks.   Overall, I rate this place 5/5. It's very quiet and relax. Perfect for study dates. Perfect for brunch or breakfast as well. The food is amazing although some stuff still need improvement. The location is kinda hidden but perfect for me since it's in walking distance. And the customer service is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"How do you spell perfection? C-A-F-E B-R-E-I-Z-H C-I-N-N-A-M-O-N R-O-L-L.  And to think that I didn't even grab one on my first visit...   Cafe Breizh is a new French cafe open from breakfast until early at night. Initial rave reviews had me excited about both their savory delights and their sweet treats. Although I would've otherwise had to drive clear across town from Henderson for them, I was getting carb-wasted at another place already and decided to drop by. They're in a relatively empty plaza on Fort Apache closer to small side street Cherokee than to large cross street Spring Mountain. I ended up making a return trip later in the week to pick up a couple more items, which are all mentioned below.  The interior is very spacious, with a simple glass display running in a straight line from the wall to the register. You can watch them make crepes and galettes behind another glass barrier on the other side of the register, or you can just find a table in the relatively modest seating area, which will doubtless become crowded when they get more popular.  La Traditional Galette ($9) - first bite, owing to Nelson Q's review. First and last impression: the buckwheat batter was a bit too salty. Still, it's a crispy crepe with just a little bit of chewiness inside. I'm sure I've been sheltered in terms of ham, but the thinly sliced meat on this galette had great flavor and was textured like actual meat. The cheese was delicious, and the only fault with the egg yolk in the center is that it was a little small.  Ham and Cheese Croissant ($4) - indeed the earthly delight that others have raved about. Delicious, flaky croissant topped with a truly crunchy crust of cheese, and an air pocket inside that holds the same delightful ham as in the galette. It was a struggle to force myself not to eat the second half. I ended up briefly popping the remainder in the oven, and while the flavor didn't change, the warmth was very welcome.  Quiche ($5.50) - huge slices of savory egg custard heaven. Both varieties have a thick layer of silky, eggy deliciousness crowned by a beautiful golden-brown top, and the crumbly crust gives the perfect textural counterpoint. The Lorraine has a bottom layer of cheese and cubes of their excellent ham, and the Salmon & Broccoli has smoky flaky salmon with soft broccoli florets. These are more satisfying to me than the Ham and Cheese Croissants - just make sure they're heated up if they've just come out of the cold display case. (Yes, I actually ate some cold quiche at first.)  Croissant ($3) - a taller but not-so-long form that also contains an airy interior. I've seen this shape but once before, so at least you can enjoy the visual novelty. It has a great buttery crust, but the flavor wasn't as memorable as the best in town. Perhaps I'll have to taste it again on a completely empty stomach.  Almond Croissant ($3.75) - almond paste is similar to what you'll find in almond croissants, but because they decided to load the interior with wet almond paste, the bottom of the croissant becomes unusually wet. Otherwise, the flavor is fine and the non-moist bits of croissant are nicely crispy.  Apple Turnover ($3.50) - one of the best turnovers that I've had, but not one of the best apple pastries. I loved the buttery, flaky pastry that seems to have had a sweet glaze brushed on top to help achieve sweet, deep golden-brown crust. However, although the apple interior had great flavor, but too much of it was pureed almost to the point of being apple sauce. I want large chunks of juicy apple.  Chocolate Chip Cookie ($2.25) - generous amount of darker chocolate embedded throughout the cookie. Better than the chocolate chip cookie that I had at another French bakery (which might not even be offered there anymore). However, I'm not a fan of this style in general. I strongly prefer the ones with that distinctive flavor that I assume comes baking it until brown (but still keeping the interior soft).  Blueberry Muffin ($3.50) - tons of blueberries in the base, which is actually the minority of the pastry. The muffin top is absurdly huge, and it's a crispy and crumbly treat that doesn't feel too heavy like Costco muffins do. A great option overall.  Cinnamon Roll ($3.50) - the star of this place in terms of sweets, with an addictively sweet crunchy caramelized crust giving way to a spongy interior and great cinnamon flavor throughout. I did bill it as perfect, but I actually want even more of that crust. Maybe cutting the roll instead of simply pulling the spiral apart would help to even out the crust distribution. This ain't your run-of-the-mill grocery store or mall cinnamon roll.  Cafe Breizh is an excellent place for savories and offers at least one superstar sweet pastry. I look forward to trying their tarts and freshly cooked sweet crepes the next time that I make the cross-town trek. Minor disappointments aside, this is a great new French bakery that neighborhood locals should feel very happy to have."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a weekend since I couldn't handle the hotel breakfast food offered. Parking was no issue.  As I approached the counter there was a large selection of baked goods to pick from along with a board on the wall of their cooked to ordered items.   All the fresh baked items looked so yummy, not to mention the menu items made my choice difficult. I finally selected the berry crepe, omelet & potatoes and a Nutella croissant. Everything was delicious - great quality, freshnest and a perfect amount for two.  Only con here is what to order. I would definitely recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"I stopped by Cafe Breizh to pick up some treats for a friend's birthday this morning , it was nice that they open early.  I have to say these are the best  pastries I've had in Vegas in 20 years! Everyone asked where I got the delicious pastries.  I never knew pastries could melt in your mouth.  Definitely divine!   I'm going back to try out the Ham & cheese croissant and quiche !"}
{"text":"Longest wait to get an overpriced iced coffee I have ever endured. Granted there was only one person working the counter but she didn't even acknowledge me for the first 5 mins standing there. After waiting I finally sat back down and was about ready to leave and tell her to forget my order when she tells me she's getting to work on my coffee another 10 mins goes by and I go up to the counter to pay and she's almost done. I gave her a five and told her to keep the rest unsure as to how long it would be for her to make change. The \"iced coffee\" was more like ice with about 2 sips of coffee. And even though they were open till 7pm they had almost nothing in their bakery display aside from some oatmeal cookies and a cinnamon roll that looked as though it'd been out there for hours. I will not return which is sad I recommended this place to a friend in which to meet because I was excited to try it based on reviews. Huge disappointment both customer service and product wise."}
{"text":"Wonderful and fresh pastries, croissants and more.  I had the best almond croissant since visiting Paris.  Ordered the cafe mocha, perfect blend.  The apple tarts are super flaky and not too sweet.   I can not wait to try more items.  The crepes look amazing, next time I visit.  Prices are comparable to any bakery but the quality is extremely beautiful.  Will be visiting often."}
{"text":"Pastries are so delicious and the place is clean! This place is simple and smells like fresh butter!"}
{"text":"I heard of this place from a friend a few days ago, as they just opened at the start of this month. Cafe Breizh's menu is comprised of pastries, savory/sweet crepes, and an array of beverages (that range from coffees, teas, and even hot chocolate)!  They claim to have an authentic taste of Brittany, France in all its crispy glory. I say this because a lot of their inventory that I've tried tends to have a soft but crispy aftertaste. I can understand the idea though, since Brittany (or Bretagne, if you want to be French-y) specializes in crêperie restaurants.   I ordered their La Norvegienne savory crepe, tiramisu, and cinnamon roll. My friend ordered La Chevrotine savory crepe and an apple turnover. The crepes were minimalistic, soft but crispy; I liked how buttery the smoked salmon was as well as their sautéed veggies in the center blended well with the cream chive (even the onions were subtle in taste). I definitely recommend the La Norvegienne as its consistent in taste on my second visit there!   I also ordered their hot chocolate, which was very light in flavor, but wasn't overtly sweet. Their cinnamon roll was crunchy, but the interior was soft and slightly fluffy. The tiramisu was creamy and was nonetheless a light eat.   Most of their sweets I noticed thus far weren't sickeningly sweet, which I liked. I also bought their macarons (raspberry & pistachio) to bring with me to work, and even hours after the flavors were still intact, neither sweet nor too nutty but soft and tasty in every bite!  Please note that they are open from 7am-7pm daily, tucked away near the middle of the plaza at the corner of Fort Apache & Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Everything I've had here from the sandwiches to the pastries has been superb.   Trust me and try the apple turnover."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on Saturday morning and it was so cute inside and the pastries/coffee was delicious. This place is conveniently located near my house and I pass by it all the time so I was dying to try it out once they opened. I had the cinnamon roll and a coffee. The prices weren't bad. The coffee was delicious. I am a big coffee fan. The cinnamon roll was warm and flaky and taste like it was made from scratch. My wife ordered a Nutella crepe and the tiramisu. I didn't try the crepe, but the portion was huge. The tiramisu was delicious. One of the best I've tasted. I would totally recommend this cute little spot and I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"My first time here was this morning for breakfast. I had a ham and cheese croissant, which was huge, flakey, rich and delicious, accompanied by a nice size French coffee. Everything was great. Everything was so good this morning that I actually had to go back later in the afternoon and pick up more goodies. they're open 7 days a week until 7 p.m. which is amazing."}
{"text":"Great spot for some amazing pastries and coffee. The croissants were delicious and the cinnamon bun is one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"A great little gem hidden away in a strip mall. Coffee is excellent and their almond croissant was devine. My only regret is that they are on the other side of town from where I live and I won't be able to frequent as much as I'd like."}
{"text":"A great little cafe! The food is delicious and the restaurant is simple and bright. I will definitely be coming back, because everything on the menu looked as good as the food I ordered. The coffee was lovely too!"}
{"text":"This little Parisian breakfast/brunch place is a gem! The La Tradition galette with turkey, eggs, and cheese was delicious! Follow that with an almond croissant (ask them to warm it up) and let it all set with an earl grey tea! Absolutely delightful! Just fair warning, the coffee here is strong!"}
{"text":"I visited the place for the first time today and I am delighted! I tried the croissant, the almond croissant and the chocolate brioche (I believe that was the right name). Everything was amazingly delicious! The service was great as well. There are limited pastries options but they are fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this gem. It's a cute cozy place hidden off Fort Apache. I wanted to pick up some treats for my family who were visiting - everything was made to perfection. I can't get enough of the almond croissant ! This place offers pastries, crepes, and tarts - so much more. I had to get at least one of each to try with the fam and let's just say, everyone loved each dessert. Omg their chocolate little cake was chocolate heaven!! If you love chocolate, this is a must! It"}
{"text":"Tried Cafe Breizh yesterday and was not disappointed! I had the Traditional Gallette with ham, cheese, and an egg. It was delicious! I also brought home a Quiche Loraine, Apple Turnover, a Ham and Cheese croissant , and an Almond croissant. All of them were Amazing!"}
{"text":"This cafe is amazing.  I have eaten there several times in the past month.  I can not get over the flakiness of the croissants. The crepes are heavenly.  I highly the tropical crepe with roasted pineapple."}
{"text":"Excellent french pastries here with the star of the show being the apple turnover. Perfect balance of flaky crust with non-canned apple fruit filling. BRAVO for keeping a warm oven on when they offer to warm up your pastry. One too many times have diners/cafes used a microwave to heat up pastries and ruin them! This place knows exactly what they're doing. One small negative was the very friendly guy helping me behind the register was wearing a rather soiled white hat... small negative for a wonderful addition to the Vegas pastry scene."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the most delicious pastries I have ever eaten - very fresh and seems like high quality ingredients.  For sure better than any other bakery I have tried locally.  Got a wide assortment and everything was excellent.  Prices are a little high for me.  Coffee was so-so - maybe consider partnering with a local roaster?  It was slammed in there when we came in this Sunday morning, no chairs inside or outside free, so had to get it to go.  Wanted to try a crepe but maybe next time."}
{"text":"What a treasure find! I accidentally stumbled upon  Cafe Breizh only to discover the cutest French bakery ever. The young cashier was knowledgeable and sweet. The display was packed with gorgeous French pastries and the smell of delicious fresh baked goodness! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Review based on pick-up cake order!  On January 2nd, I pre-ordered a Galette des Rois after doing some Yelp research for French bakeries. Cafe Breizh was the only one! So I emailed Pierre and put in an order for 1 Galette des Rois!  It cost me 30$ but it was enough for 6 people. It was flaky, buttery, and almond-y goodness :) I enjoyed every bite and was happy to see how they included a gold paper crown for the lucky person who found the feve (a little donkey). Very high quality galette and I would order it again.   When I went to pick up the cake, the place was empty so I didn't have to worry about waiting in line. The place is very clean, bright, spacious, and modestly decorated. There is a long glass display where their pastries entice you. The man who helped me with my order was kind and polite.  I'd recommend coming here for authentic French bakery experience!"}
{"text":"Love it...I stopped here on my way to work and bought a few chocolate croissants and regular croissants. They were so delicious. My coworkers and I liked them very much."}
{"text":"On entering this small bakery I heard a chorus of \"Monsieur Westie\" emanating from the pastry display case which included the most eye appealing croissants and other pastries I have ever found in Las Vegas. I was sorely tempted by those little voices, but I chose La Chevrotine gallete - chevre, mushroom and bacon that was a bit dry. My wife's sugar deficiency was (temporarily) satisfied by the Breizh crepe - caramel, butter, baked apple and whipped cream that brought a smile to her face and a vow to return. Though the restaurant no longer participates in restaurant.com, chef/owner Pierre Gatel allowed me to use one."}
{"text":"The deserts were perfect not to sweet it had the right amount of sweet and savory taste to them. I will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Oh snap! After being in Paris a few months ago this was a happy surprise to find! And WOW the pastries are fluffy and delicious! Don't walk, run over and get yourself a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"Excellent, top notch service and then the food! Love the simple and clean decor. I'm all for the minimalist look anyways. The star here is the chef and his passion for making serious brunch goodness. First off, if you could resist the jewelry display of freshly made French pastries you can treat yourself to ( what I recommend ) La Traditional Galette. You could pick ham or turkey and I picked turkey. Honestly, I just figured these were savory crepe options, but what came.out were like pieces of art! The portion was huge and I opted for a side salad which was neatly placed to the corner of the Galette. The salad was perfectly dressed with a light dressing and provided a nice crunch element with the soft and warm turkey cheese crepe. They offer coffee, espresso, cappuccino, and latte, but the canned latte in a fridge off to the left caught my eye. It was a draft latte, which was explained to me do not shake the can and the foam will rise to the top like a latte. Chef even gave me a chilled glass with ice to pour over to fully enjoy this canned latte. How thoughtful! The place had a lot of people picking up pastries and coffee to go as well as prepped salads the chef just put in the fridge. He was cooking, prepping, greeting people, and even cleaning up the tables. He had one girl at the register who helped out too, but he was not too good to roll up his sleeves and help keep the place tidy and running smooth. Wow! I was surprisingly full after my meal and really wanted to try the chocolate brioche and the Napoleon, but I know I will be back even though it is out my way. This place is worth the drive and the prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite eateries are French cafes. I love its casual chic environment and they have all of my favorite foods! Every one is a little different and what I love about Cafe Breizh is their strong offerings of galettes, quiches, and phenomenal pastries.   I've had their Croissant, Almond Croissant, Pain au Chocolat, Ham and Cheese Croissant, Strawberry Tart, and Nutella Brioche. The croissants are A M A Z I N G. Flaky, buttery, heavenly goodness. All of the pastries are great, however, I did not care for the Nutella Brioche; the bread was a tad dry and its overall flavor was shrug-worthy.   The Galettes ($9-$12) are fabulous as well! I've really enjoyed La Norvgienne (salmon with beautiful sautéed vegetables and crème) and La Chevrotine (crispy bacon, goat cheese, and mushroom).   I tried the Salmon and Broccoli Quiche on my first visit and it was just okay. The eggs weren't very creamy and it had very little flavor. However, the Mushroom Spinach Gouda Quiche was phenomenal on my most recent trip! The eggs were custard-y and the flavor was wonderful. Quiches: $5.50.  A new addition to the savory menu is the Croque Monsieur and Croque Madame ($11). We opted for the egg version (Madame) and were very pleased with the dish. Delicious!!  An update since my first visit in March is the salad (chopped Romaine lettuce tossed in housemade vinaigrette) is no longer included with their savory dishes; it is an extra $1.50 per dish. Boo!  This is easily one of the best French bakeries in town and I love finding reasons to stop in, especially for a meal."}
{"text":"I really really love here!  Here has real french crepes and Galette:) If I'm living close here,It'd be so dangerous!! Because all food is sooooo delicious! I can't pass over. Phew!! Anyway, I'd like to stop by here anytime when I've chance!!That's how much I love it."}
{"text":"Amazing croissants, very soft, very tasty,  Best croissants in the town. I am going to go there very often.  They have delicious coffees.I think everything's is very delicious over there."}
{"text":"Everything is yummy. Croissants is so original France, ham and cheese croissant, yummy!   crepes refresh made per order! Coffee is bold and full of flavor. Cinnamon roll has more layers than Cinnabon can offer. One of must try item!"}
{"text":"Best blueberry muffins ! Baguette's are the best in town! Crepes are second to none! Cafe Breizh is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Very clean and quaint little French cafe.  We had the mushroom, goat cheese, and bacon galette and the strawberry and nutella crepe. Both were delicious! Very authentic flavors and not too heavy.  The chef, Pierre Gatel was a great host and very accomodating."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great pastries, coffee and service! I have cravings for the almond croissants. They are light fluffy and flavorful."}
{"text":"The Café Breizh is pretty new and the 702Shifters usually starts the ride from here most of Sundays.  The Chef bakes fresh pasties and you can smell it when you get there early.  The pasties are bomb!  Coffee is excellent too.  The best coffee shop in Vegas so far for me.  My recommendation is have large sun cover outside seating so that we can enjoy our coffee without the sun beating now on us.  Also more tables and chairs are needed outside."}
{"text":"Today Joy and I had lunch at Cafe Breizh. We were pleasantly surprised by the French treats, cold and hot sandwiches, salads and crepes. Their food was delicious and fresh. We split a tuna on a baguette a blueberry muffin and two cups of coffee. $15.00 bucks. Surprised how busy it got for a for a new French Cafe. Close to home too. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a sweet little place - as far as I can tell just opened and the locals are on it!  Both sweet & savory crepes - I had the Salmon Crepe - lovely - smoked salmon, veggies, cremé.  That along with my double café latte - excellent.  Come by - I hear the bakery items are to die for but was too satisfied this time to try them.  Really lovely staff/owners."}
{"text":"I'm from Paris and i hate the sweetness level in every American cake. But here when i tried their pain au chocolat, i know i might find a good authentic French bakery. Everything's perfect even their hot chocolate. Ambiance is nice with true French classic song not US Fm with ton of recent rap music :(. I just wish they could do Pain au raisin, my morning breakfast when i were student in French.  5 star for sure !"}
{"text":"A great new French bakery. This place is the real deal. I still dream about that almond croissant..."}
{"text":"At first glance, I thought I may have entered a fake \"Disney-esque\" Main Street USA or Epcot Center cafe due to the very clean, open and sterile environment.  I have seen a lot more pastry choices at nearby French bakeries at lower prices, but decided to stay. The pumpkin cheesecake with an egg shaped dollop of whipped cream, see photo, was very good. Not too sweet and just enough richness, way better than anything at Cheesecake Factory. The la Colome Coffee is very good as Cafe Breizh is the only store in Las Vegas to offer it. The person working the counter was not well versed in the products.  When asked about the topping on the cheescake was cheese or whipped cream, she didn't know.  I told her later that I figured out what it was...a poached egg!  She believed me!"}
{"text":"Kind of a strange shopping  center for this little gem. They would put some of the higher cost pastry cafe that's on the strip an major hotel to shame. They only reason they didn't get the 5 stars was the service was a bit slow and it wasn't even crowded. All that said, it's a must go."}
{"text":"I'll preface this with the detail that I didn't realize it was 10min before they open and this is rating is solely based on owners attitude to his employees. The pastries looked like art and decadent to be honest.   I came in and the employee said I would need to wait 10 min for the missing items which was fine I just walked in early. The owner gave a confused and irritated look to the super sweet counter employee. Then the owner stood up straight while puffing up his chest and said \"he's just an employee\" (like a pompous jerky to make his employee feel small) \"I'm the owner you can order anything you want\". It made me upset for the employee, I was embarrassed for this poor kid. The owner deserved a karate chop to the neck it was in such bad taste.   I made my order the super nice kid went to back to retrieve the items from the back and the tough guy owner comes out saying it's not ready. I couldn't hold back and said \"but you're the owner you just said I can order anything and this nice employee was wrong, you're the owner right, you don't know.\" I continued to explain how the way he spoke to his employee was terrible and he shouldn't treat people that way. I also told him to give his employees wind beneath their wings and loving nudges instead. Then I left, I couldn't give him any money. Poor kid has to deal with random people all day he doesn't need to be belittled too. Upsets me when ownership treats their employees like that. Didn't see a tip jar for the kid either, maybe just on cash register."}
{"text":"My new favorite pastries place now!!! The place just opened up for about 3 months. A little small but cute though. This is My 2nd time here. I've tried the ham and cheese croissant, blueberry muffin, Apple turnover, and the almond croissant. Everything I had was delicious!! I like to eat there better since they actually warm up the pastries for you. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Went today for my 1st time.  The young lady at the counter was friendly and knowledgeable.   I ordered a decaf cafe au lait. It was perfect.  My husband ordered a delicious blueberry muffin.  About to leave, I could not resist buying a baguette. We have been snacking on it all day. He just took a bite and said 'this is really good bread, what's in it?'. I told him it was just normal bread, but good, fresh, quality ingredients make a huge difference.  I'm looking forward to going back to try a crepe."}
{"text":"Everything we have had here as been wonderful, their crepes are amazing. Pastries limited but no matter what you get, you will be happy with your choice. Wonderful customer service. They make you feel comfortable. As you watch them prepare your crepe it is like watching perfection at work. Beautiful and mouth watering presentation."}
{"text":"Cafe Breizh by far is my favorite place for delectable sweets!  In my opinion, you can not compare their unbelievable desserts with any other cafes in Las Vegas! My favorites are their lemon tarts, raspberry tarts, napoleons, strawberry shortcakes, brioche, & of course their melt in your mouth Macaroons! That's why it was an easy decision to order my daughter's Birthday cake from here.   Pierre personally took my order and asked me detailed questions what type of cake I wanted and the design.  The Cake turned out so Beautiful and met all my expectations. Pierre made sure all the details were perfect! I ordered their white cake with this melt in your mouth white cream/white chocolate filling. The cake transformed me to a Parisian Cafe in Paris.    My Birthday Girl's eyes lit up when she saw her gorgeous blue cake and all the guests couldn't stop talking about the beautiful design and the taste of it being just perfect European Sweetness.  Thank you Pierre for an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Amazing croissant and bakery. The chicken ranch sandwich was amazing, bread was on point. Glad I finally went in. Great little spot for breakfast /lunch. Nice vibe"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious . Hands down the best quiche I've ever eaten . What an awesome find!"}
{"text":"It's an open, brightly lit dining room.  The staff was friendly and the food was served in a timely manner.  The presentation of the food was very good.  I think there was a miscommunication on the order and I did not receive an egg as part of the galette even though she asked and I specified how I wanted the egg cooked.  The crepe was buckwheat.  I'm not sure why; I don't recall that being a part of the description of what I ordered.  Besides the lack of egg and a buckwheat crepe, it was good.  The lemonade was good (advertised as homemade).  The prices are a tad high considering what I received.  I was the only person in the dining area.  There were approximately five customers who came and went with carry out orders while I was there dining.  Overall, it was still a nice experience and I might be back in the future to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"To its credit (and enjoyment) Las Vegas has seen its share of new French bakeries, (La Belle Terra, etc) but Cafe Breizh is my new hands-down favorite. Opened just this month I can say, having been to quite a few in country, that this is the real deal. They're galettes and crepês are simply to die for. And their pastries are the work of a true connoisseur. Located in a otherwise nondescript strip mall on S Fort Apache this place is certain to become a favorite on anyone's list who appreciates the fine arts of French baking. The dining room is simple but small though they have poured a patio stretching out into the parking lot which will no doubt be packed come spring/summer. A must for pastry hounds...  Update: today I tried the Briezh crepe with caramel butter and apple. Extraordinary! Also had my first pain chocolate here. I've had these all over France but without question this one was the lightest, most flaky and crisp one ever. Oh, and scrumptiously chocolaty. Marvel below at the chevrontine, mushrooms, gruyere, bacon...if I close my eyes I'm transported back to Northern France..."}
{"text":"Great crepes, sweet pastry is soft. I tried their Lorraine quiche, not a big fan, smelt n taste fishy for some reason. Its a cute place."}
{"text":"Quiche.   I have either been eating bad quiche my whole life or everyone else is doing it wrong because their version is to die for.  It is just SO good.  Oh my gawd, orgasm in the mouth-worthy good!  It's ridiculous smooth, silky and rich...and just plain delicious!! I now crave quiche...well, at least their version only!  They have three kinds - Lorraine (Gruyere and ham); Mushroom, Spinach and Gouda; and Salmon and Broccoli.  My favorite of the three is the Lorraine, but I'll be more than happy to eat the other two should my first choice be sold out.  (I always call ahead because they do tend to sell out of these yummy things!)  Their galettes are also something to also write home about.  First off, their galette is a Breton galette, from the Brittany region of France.  So, it's actually more like a crepe or pancake made from buckwheat flour.  There is something just delicious about the actual batter they use!  I love it.  They have four variations - La Tradition (egg, cheese, ham or turkey); La Vegetarienne (celery, carrot, turnip, and tomato reduction; La Chevrotine (mushroom, goat cheese and bacon); and La Norvgienne (sautéed vegetables, salmon, and cream chive).  My favorite is the La Norvgienne.  Their sweet crepes are also yummy too.  They have a lot of various pastries displayed and are popular, but I come only for the quiche and galettes.  The few downsides would be there isn't a whole lot of seating.  There are some tables outside if you can bear the heat.  Service can be great, depending on which waitress you get.  (The water containers always need to be refilled.)  Usually the staff brings the food to our table.  However, I noticed with coffees and pastries, some will just call out your order and hope you eventually come to the counter and get it yourself. Nonetheless, these will not deter me from getting the most delicious quiches and galettes in town. (The Little Guy and Little Gal love coming here because they devour it all up!)"}
{"text":"This place has the potential of being a 5 star place. The food is absolutely delectable. Everything I've ordered has been phenomenal. The ambience is awesome, super clean and inviting. You walk in and your eyes grow 10xs the size at their array of delicious looking pastries, cookies and croissants and everything we've tried has lived up to their look.   The problem here is the customer service. The girls are really sweet but their ability to juggle even just two sets of customers is not there. They don't acknowledge more than one customer at a time (not even a be with you in a moment) and ordering takes forever. My husband literally stood there for 8 minutes waiting to ask for a set of silverware. We didn't even ask for a to go bag because we knew it would take about 10 mins if we had to stand in line again.  We'll definitely be back because the food is totally worth it but it's hard not to scowl at the service!   This has become one of my favorite neighborhood spots and I don't want it to leave just because service will keep them from excelling."}
{"text":"Amazing french bakery cafe. By far, the most tastiest crepe I ate in the U.S. The pastries are delicious.  A taste of France. We also ate quish that was good. The prices are reasonable.  If you are visiting Vegas, you must visit this place!!!"}
{"text":"Loved our crepes and Coffee. Alexis made our crepes with extreme care and detail. I had the baked apple and caramel, the apples were fresh and super sweet tasting. You must give this awesome bakery a try ....Ask for Alexis to make your crepes :)"}
{"text":"Best pastries in our area of the city.  Quality ingredients and great execution.  They even know to tell you detailed reheating instructions if you're getting pastries to go.  Can't go wrong with this place.  Had a great savory crepe and apple turnover.  The turnover's pastry was super flaky and tender with just the right amount of crispness on the outside.  Tasty filling.  Crepe had mushrooms, goat cheese, and bacon.  Delicious."}
{"text":"I love the quiche! They were busy and messed our order up for to go items as well as dine in items, everything was good none the less."}
{"text":"Another great place to fulfill my quiche craving. They have croissants, crepes (savory & sweet), macaroons... so much I want to try I need to get back in soon!"}
{"text":"What a lovely find to come across with my girlfriend after Pilates. The two French chefs and the lovely young lady at the counter were as appealing as the tempting breads and pastries behind the glass.   The space was light and airy....perfect to sip espresso and chat over a nutella brioche. There is patio seating with unbrellas but the full sun of the Vegas summer heat made outdoor seating a good choice at this time of year. My hopes is that a little greenery (potted topiaries or trees) would add to the ambiance and comfort.   The espresso and spinach and gouda quiche i had was perfection. The green salad you can add for $1.50 was generously portioned and nicely dressed.   My girlfriend had the galette with mushroom, bacon and spinach. We definitely will be back again, with friends."}
{"text":"I had no idea what the hell a galatte was when I came here. Actually I'm still not 100% sure what it is, but all I know is that it tastes good. Take the risk my friend.   Came here for brunch with the sister,  don't see too many good french places off the strip. No one wants to go down to the strip. That's the dark side.  Small little cafe, but they had a large assortment of pastries and crepes. And these crepe like things called galattes, which i guess  could be compared to an omelette pancake. Staff was friendly and the pricing isn't too bad.  The only thing I could of gone without, is the sight of all the middleaged women coming in their ill fitted yoga pants. That's Spring Valley for you."}
{"text":"WOW!!! This place is the best! We came in for breakfast. I had the #1 i think it was egg, ham and cheese. Hubby had #4 it was with salmon cant remember the name. We were expecting sandwiches but they came out with crepes! Im not much of a crepe eater because I've never had one i actually liked but wow!! It was amazing!! It was super fresh and super good. Hubby's salmon was divine! Probably the best and most fresh salmon we have had. We couldn't get enough so we also ordered a ham and cheese croissant which was also delicious. The orange juice was tasty too!! Everything was fresh and just tasted absolutely amazing. They also had really yummy looking pastries out that looked like they were just baked but we didn't have room for more food. We will defiantly be coming back! The place is super clean and the simplicity is perfect. So glad this place opened right by our house!"}
{"text":"Super cute little cafe great for breakfast or brunch. They have sandwiches and omelette as well as delicious pastries! They're known for the 'ham and cheese croissant' so make sure to try that when you go. They make crepes in front of you which was pretty cool to see as well. They have a very bright and neat decor and it's a great date spot for some coffee and breakfast.   I tried the bacon omelette with ham and cheese croissant and it was delicious    They also have a outside seating available FYI."}
{"text":"New French pastry cafe. They also have crepess and galettes (look it up if you don't know). I tried the cinnamon roll, chocolate croissant, and apple turnover. All were very fresh and amazing. My favorite was the croissant. Coffee was also on point. Would highly recommend. Very reasonable prices, clean and great service."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  It's sorta on my way to work and sorta close to home so I sorta find myself sorta going out of my way to get there amazing espresso drinks.  I love me a good iced latte and this place does them right! They don't taste burnt and are always on point.  I've tried the food and loved my crepe!!  They are prepared fresh while you wait.  Each pastry I've tried has been excellent!    The service is great! Since I've been coming here it's been the same staff which is great!  No turnover at a restaurant rarely happens.  I walk in and now the servers ask \"the usual\"?  How awesome is that?  My order isn't simple as I like half caffeine and half vanilla with 2% milk.  They always get it right!!    Finally someplace sorta close to where I frequent!!  I say, give this place a shot!  You will definitely find yourself going outta your way just to come here.  They are off Ft. apache and Twain on the NW side of the street (right hand side as you drive on Ft apache going towards Flamingo.  It's before Twain :-)"}
{"text":"Very good pastry and \"galette des rois\" Love the brocolis salmon quiche  Little cold place need to be more attractive but really good food"}
{"text":"Items Selected: La Colombe Americano Ham and Cheese Croissant Almond Croissant Cinnamon Roll Blueberry Muffin Raspberry Tart Oatmeal Raisin Cookie Chocolate Chip Cookie Apple Turnover  Opened at the onset of December and featuring the work of Strip-veteran Pierre Gatel plus his partner Jerome Marchand, Café Breizh adds one more French Bakery to the growing half-dozen in the West Valley with longer hours than most and a some unexpected surprises including Coffee from La Colombe plus the offering of French Crepes.  Located on South Fort Apache, the interior featuring sleek design and clean white lines though the area surrounding it seems most well-known for a Dollar Store and Little Caesars, patrons of Café Breizh are invited to dine on a wide diversity of items both sweet and savory at one of the restaurant's indoor tables or a soon-to-be-built patio while the ramp-up process in the kitchen is already underway.  Said to have been a longtime dream for Chef Gatel, his birth and training both in Northern France before bringing his skills overseas where classic recipes were featured at Wynn and Encore for over a decade, it is with wide eyes that most will take in the beautiful creations stored behind glass as more items bake in the kitchen to replete daily choices from seven in the morning until seven in the evening.  Eventually opting for a half-dozen plus one pastries, Pierre tacking on an Americano plus one more after a visit to the kitchen that is still a bit disorganized but assuredly up-and-running with plenty of room to grow, first bites of a Ham and Cheese Croissant glistening beneath a shattering shell of Cheddar quickly gave notice that the team knows its stuff, the separated layers soft and delicate despite being filled with sliced Pork and easily one of Las Vegas best savory breakfast items, on-Strip or off.  Moving on to sweeter things, even the Chef's already-known description of a 'traditional' Almond Croissant not enough to convince me that the one at Café Breizh isn't soggy and overly slathered with Frangipane - though my 9-year old dining companion admittedly liked it a lot - far better textures were found in a tightly wound Cinnamon Roll only rivaled by CRAFTkitchen locally for balance of crunch and springy center without rendering the edges dried-out.  Serving an admirable Blueberry Muffin, the shallow-welled baking pan making it almost 80% 'top' with fresh Blueberries throughout, Pierre's Raspberry Tart offers a lot of good Fruit atop a Shortbread-style crust though the filling beneath is a little underwhelming, his Turnover far better as a result of making the inside from freshly sliced Fuji Apples without too much sugar and just a hint of salt.  Rounding out the morning with two Cookies, the better of the two a toss-up as each features a crisp rim and nearly Pudding-soft center, Chef Gatel states that the secret to his Chocolate Chip is allowing the chunks of Dark Chocolate to melt slightly before mixing them into the batter while the Oatmeal is just a matter of using good ingredients, something that a look at his walk-in and prep-table makes quite evident for all of his creations.  ****Already off to a good start and a welcome addition to an area that certainly needs it, Café Breizh is the sort of place that will be interesting to watch and revisit over time, Chef Gatel and his partner clearly possessing a lot of skill as well as passion with a kitchen more than capable of doing more should the community demand it."}
{"text":"Quiches, salads, croissants OH MY!  Cafe Breizh offers doughy delights and exceptionally crafted coffee drinks.   Macaroons- check.  Authentic- check:) Succulent galettes freshly made in front of you (I opt for the one with mushrooms & bacon).  Pastries here are clearly prepared with dedication.   For example, that brownie!!!  I've deemed this brownie as the best brownie ever.  Rich dark chocolate with walnuts:)   As soon as I enter I cannot miss those stunning creations.  Yes, they are edible.  I know, I know they look too good to eat.  Go ahead order one for that coffee and be sure to order some additional creations for home.  Yes- they have boxes for enjoying them at home or gifting them!    It's not easy in deciding, so I don't.   I simply return and order another for later:)"}
{"text":"All locals and non-locals should try this place! Their food was amazing and staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. I'm speechless with their food... Definitely, will be one of my favorite coffee shops!"}
{"text":"Love the Gibraltar coffee, chocolate croissant and lemon crepe. The tables inside are quite small though."}
{"text":"Just happened to be driving by and stopped to check this place out. I figured since it was Friday I would bring a few treats in for the office to share. The young kid behind the counter was really friendly and helped recommend some stuff to try and a man who I assumed was the chef/owner came out and told me about the items I was selecting also. It was a little pricey but absolutely did not disappoint. The lemon tart was delicious as was the apple turnover and I practically swooned over the cinnamon roll. Cannot wait to come back and am anxious to spread the word about this little gem."}
{"text":"Merci Chef Pierre Gatel et Jerome Marchand pour les pâtisseries délicieuses! Thank you Chef Perrier and Jerome Marchand for the delicious pastries! From the moment you walk into this spacious and modern French cafe. Your greeted by a wonderful staff. It was a pleasure to have the Chefs serve us and made sure that everything was good. We notice that a good portion of the customers were speaking French and it reminded me the many cafes that I frequent when I visited Paris in 2012. It assured us that this place is going to be very popular.  Onto the delicious pastries, everything we had was simply amazing! From the fresh croissants to the apple turnover and the pumpkin cheesecake was wonderful. Another favorite is the Almond croissant and Cinnamon roll, were on point along with the French macaroons. However, I didn't get the chance to try any of their Crepes and Galettes. We did a get chance to enjoy the delicious Salmon & Broccoli Quiche. Highly recommend, it was full of flavor and not bland or salty. The quiche was consistent and the flaky crust was delicious. After visiting this cafe twice in one month. I have decided that this is definitely going to be one of my favorite French cafe for me.  2017 Yelp Review #6"}
{"text":"Cafe Breizh is a fantastic bakery to go to if you're looking for light French faire or have a craving for sweets. I've been here twice and have tried their crepes, quiche, and a couple of baked goods such as the almond croissant and cinnamon roll.   The staff is always kind and knowledgeable of the items available that day. They're always great at recommending pairings for savory and sweet if you can't quite decide what you want.   Like any other hole in the wall, Cafe Breizh should be recognized for the apparent care in their food which  shines through in the meticulously created flavors experienced in every dish."}
{"text":"The BEST French café west of Paris, France!  I am a vegetarian () so my faves do not involve meat. HOWEVER, the Niçoise salad made me eat tuna again! The Caprese is \"to-die-for!\"  My favorite \"shopping location\" for authentic French café experience."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect example of everything that is great about Yelp. After spending a few days eating at chains and not-so-great Vegas dining establishments I really wanted to try something different: Fresh, clean, and local. A French Creperie/Bakery? I'm so there! With over 100 reviews and four and a half stars you're almost guaranteed to love it.  My friends and I arrived shortly after they opened on a Wednesday (The Fourth of July, in fact!). They had a glorious assortment of pastries and desserts on display. GLORIOUS. Fruit tarts, macarons, plain and almond croissants, pain au chocolat, Nutella brioche, apple turnovers, cinnamon rolls, tiramisu, brownies, cookies, etc etc. They also had some savory items: quiches, chicken salad croissants, and beautiful golden crusty baguettes.   We all stood in awe for a moment before getting down to business. First, we wanted to try the galettes (basically savory crepes made with buckwheat batter), and through some terrible error we managed to order the same one (terrible only because I would have liked to try the others): La Chevrotine with mushroom, goat cheese, and bacon. After ordering the owner and chef came out and made them in front of us! He is truly from France which just added to the charm of the whole experience. He talked to us a bit, and was even kind enough to offer to delay making our sweet crepe until after we'd finished our galettes (we declined because we were impatient, and stuffing our faces with all the food needed to happen immediately). Both the galettes and crepes look large, and they are quite filling, but the batter is very thin, and the toppings are not overwhelming, so unless you're not very hungry don't do yourself the disservice of sharing with someone. La Chevrotine was fantastic. The goat cheese was excellent quality, mild, but still tasty, and the mushrooms were perfectly sautéed. I opted to include the side salad which they serve on top of your galette (it did get a little warm on the bottom, which would be my only complaint about anything, but it was still wonderful). The salad consists of chopped romaine, and is lightly dressed with a simple vinaigrette. I would definitely recommend including the salad as it is a nice balance to the richness of the galette (although make no mistake, they are not too heavy). We shared the Nutella crepe with strawberries. The strawberry slices were arranged so beautifully, the whipped cream was freshly made, and the sprinkle of chocolate crunchies was the perfect touch.   We then ordered several items to take home. Descriptions in brief: Tiramisu: They taped it down in the box to prevent it from spilling, and it was a fabulous tiramisu. I especially loved the marscapone layers. Instead of ladyfingers it featured thin round cookies. Apple turnover: Possibly the flakiest pastry I've ever had. Filling was excellent and not too sweet. I reheated it in the oven at 360 degrees for a few minutes, and it was so perfect. Cinnamon roll: Reheated as above. Firm dough, but not tough. Not too cinnamon-ey either! Nutella Brioche: Brioche is one of my favorite types of bread. This was soooo soft, rich and flavorful (and huge!). It just had a thin layer of nutella over the top, so if you don't want anything terribly sweet this would be a good choice Brownie: It included walnuts, was very moist, and was stunningly frosted with a thick chocolate ganache. The chocolate was rich and of high quality.  The girl working the cash register was lovely. Very patient and friendly, and while they have self-serve water available in a dispenser, she offered us ice without our asking. Prices are reasonable: Averaging about $10 for galettes, $8 for crepes, and maybe $3 for pastries.  The interior is open, light, and bright, with windows spanning the entire front. There is seating for about fifteen inside, and also a small dining area outside.  They are about 15 minutes away from the Strip. We were on our way home, so it was no biggie, but I would encourage anyone in Vegas to visit, even if it is a bit out of their way. My friends and I all agreed that we will make a point of dining here whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best French pastries in Las Vegas. So fresh and flakey you can taste the love that is put into each item. I had the apple turnover and it was so delicious. Today I had a blueberry muffin so light and delicious and loaded with fresh blueberries. If you want an excellent pastry and cup of coffee you must try this new cafe."}
{"text":"This has recently become one of our favorite places for lunch. I reccomend anything on the menu,its delicious.  Service is spot on and the prices are reasonable. Its hard to find a good breakfast place worth coming back for but the breakfast quiche is all by itself. Kudos to the chef."}
{"text":"Wonderful little French place.  Closest thing to authentic French food in town.   In addition to my regular order, I always get a couple freshly baked baguettes to go.   The only thing I would caution is that it takes a while to get your order, so if you are in a hurry, you shouldn't go, as you will definitely be frustrated."}
{"text":"Definitely a 5-Star bakery and the best part of it is, it's located off the strip! Yay!  As a local, I hate dealing with the traffic and the crowds on the strip  and now I don't have to! There are a variety of freshly baked pastries to choose from and trust me that is not an easy task because everything looks so delicious! And it is! So far, I've tried the cinnamon roll, chocolate croissant, almond croissant, apple turnover and chocolate chip cookies! And that was only on my first visit! They have a little cafe, which I will most definitely have to check out now that I discovered this gem! I almost forgot they have an assortment of macrons, too! If you love French pastries, or bakeries in general, you should definitely CHECK. IT. OUT."}
{"text":"Good morning to my belly!! I was looking for a local hole in the wall spot to eat and I made a U-Turn for this little French inspired gem! As I walked in the environment was light, clean and simplistic. The employee was very friendly and busy taking care of the little things. The pastry display was very inviting there were many fresh colorful flaky and powdered options. I ordered the #1 La Traditional which is a ham/egg/cheese crepe. The flavor and texture made for a perfect savory breakfast. I could not stop there. I had to try something sweet!! I followed up breakfast with a lemon crepe treat...WOW! I love crepes and this was light lemony and tasted like it was made from scratch... which it probably was but it just tasted like home and filled me with delight! Thank you Cafe Breizh for a great morning meal!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Spent a few weeks in France and I enjoyed the authenticity and taste here way more!  Gotta try it."}
{"text":"My husband and two boys went to find this bakery after hearing good things and we really enjoyed our pastries and crêpe.  The coffee was satisfactory but both my husband and I prefer having coffee in a real cup. I know it sounds like something small but when you're spending the money to have a coffee out I would like it to have the atmosphere to go along with it."}
{"text":"Delicious  Got a few pastry and quiche items when. Rely opened in February , quiche was still raw after addtl baking but delish Took my French bestie here for americano and pastry and she was very impressed at the quality of the pastry and authenticity"}
{"text":"Excellent first visit! This hot and new business instantly became a bookmark after reading other Yelp reviews that mentioned the cinnamon roll.  I love cinnamon anything, but put it in a roll and I have to check it out.   Walking in, you are greeted with a view of the glass cases that show off the lovely pastries offered here, including the cinnamon rolls.  One of the chefs was making a crépe so the smells wafting through the air were delicious.  A friendly staff member took our order and we grabbed seats at a table for two.  Seating was almost all taken with customers enjoying their food.  One couple informed us that they are regulars, the husband from France and his wife from Brazil, I think.  She told us that her husband loves this place and that it's authentic French food, so we knew that this stamp of approval was a sign of good things to come. Sure enough, our order of the cinnamon roll, apple turnover, the nutella with strawberries and banana crépe, and the La Chevrotine galette with bacon, mushrooms, and goat cheese arrived and everything was beautiful not to mention delectable!  Breizh means \"Brittany\" and if this is the cuisine from that area of France, I want to go.  For now, just come to Cafe Breizh and try their cuisine for yourselves.  Friendly service and fabulous food await."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here have been amazing! BUT they never seem to get the Almond Croissant right. I've gotten it twice already and every time its been doughy in the center like its not baked all the way through. It's still good but I wish the texture was more flaky then it would be perfect! The sandwich is delicious and I love their Americanos. Great quality on everything they serve."}
{"text":"Husband, baby, and I went to this bakery. We felt unwelcome because neither employee up in the front greeted us. The place looked undecorated with white walls and furniture, and gave us a feeling of loneliness. The chairs were light and flimsy. Our baby leaned back and fell backwards on to the floor. There were no baby chairs. None of the employees asked if she was ok. Everyone just went on with their eating, and chatting and ignored us. This made us feel even more awkward. The bakery items were just ok."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  The food is very intentionally-designed and well-made.  Their sweet crepes are delicious.  Their bakery goods are wonderful.  My parents both had the savory galettes and loved them.  The coffee is great, too."}
{"text":"Picked up my friend marwah, she wanted to come here! This new French cafe is extremely neat and clean! The bakery is really cute, displaying all their pastries. I ordered the crepes with bacon, Mahra ordered the salmon crepe, an apple turnover and cinnamon roll! The pastries are all crispy and flakey, and I loved them! The crepes were all crispy as well! I like that, more savory that way. I can see myself coming back here to try all the pastries that have to sell!"}
{"text":"Missing Paris? Why yes I am! This little French Patisserie kept popping up in my Yelp feed calling my name and although this cafe was not along the Seine I was excited to check it out.  I arrived and there was just three people inside including myself which gave me the opportunity to interact with Chef Pierre. He recommended I try one of the Buckwheat Galette and I am so glad I did. I chose the vegetarian version which included celery, carrots and turnips. I had the pleasure of watching him create this artistic dish. When it was ready, he walked it over and served me. I was very impressed with his personal service and the care he took in making my dish. The Galette tasted fresh and the vegetables had the right amount of crunch. I enjoyed a cup of green tea and  enjoyed each bite!   As I sat there looking around, I noticed the simplistic and clean interior which I just loved. Minimal decor in the dining area and the showcases are not crammed full of pastries. There are just the right amount and it is looks classy. The location of the cafe is in a strip mall but stands out from the surrounding businesses.   A few moments after I begun to eat, the place filled up fast. I noticed croissants being served along with a very mouth watering quiche that I plan to try next time. Although, I was very full from consuming the Galette, I was wishing I had a little more room left to try the cinnamon roll. There is yet another reason to return. Merci' Chef Pierre, I will see you again soon!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Everything was so cute inside - white and clean and very good detailing. I felt so \"coffee shoppy\" and chic. They have lots of French options, so if you've ever meant to explore basic French lunch cuisine, this is the perfect adorable place to go. It's really far from where I live, but I definitely see myself coming back a lot!"}
{"text":"Tried their croissants and baguette...spectacular.  Presentation of croissant, flakiness, and flavor is perfection!  Also tried the baguette...crusty on outside and soft and chewy at the same time. Had some with a good soup, made a good meal even better!  Thank you Cafe Breizh for bringing your talents to the area!"}
{"text":"Their pain chocolat is very, very good. I hesitate to say perfection because I don't know what perfection would be, but it is quite good. The galettes, which are like a savory crepe but in a different batter, are also delicious. There's seating and wifi, too."}
{"text":"The best croissants and cinnamon rolls! There's really nothing at this fresh, airy bakery that isn't delicious!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and very high Mark's for their classic French patisserie.  They have the best authentic chocolate eclairs I have had, which rival or exceed what you will find in some of the best patisserie in Paris, France!"}
{"text":"This is a quaint and lovely place to sit and have coffee or tea. I stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon for a cappuccino and to try their chocolate chip cookie.  The cappuccino was delicious and designed with a heart on top. The cookie was so soft and perfectly flavored. I give it a 5/5 for both. The place is small but didn't feel crowded. I would definitely return again ."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their croissants but unfortunately, every time (the past 3 times) I've gotten real bad stomach aches. I've ordered their ham and cheese croissant and he pain chocolate. I think they should check their ingredients and preparation. Two stars because they are yummy. But I can't keep going there to get sick!"}
{"text":"HOLY-CRACKA-MOLY. Hands down the best crepe spot in Vegas. I love the texture and the flavor of their sweet crepe batter. I've had the nutella twice, and also the apple brown sugar. I'm a chocolate fan, so of course I am going to keep going back for the nutella.  That muffin tho. Just take one look, and you know it's legit. Muffin top action is to the max, just how I like it. IT's ALLLLL TOP, BABY!!!!  I'm a huge croissant fan, and it wasn't my favorite. I have yet to try their almond croissant. That one's also a HEAD TURNER.   GET IN MAH BELLYYYYYYYY."}
{"text":"Pierre is a wonderful pastry chef. The selection Is small but what they do here is amazing. The macaroons are light, moist and full of flavor. The croissants are flaky and you can taste the butter. They do not skimp out on the ingredients.  Next time I have to try the crepes, they look amazing. Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"I have not had perfect French quiche since I traveled to France years ago.  This brought back some great memories. All of the pastries looked delicious and we will be back to try them soon.  Counter service restaurant.  I think it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Very clean, great food! My friend and I ordered their $8 crepes and a blueberry muffin. The crepes are a very good size, fill up a whole plate and the muffin was amazing! I'm confident that anything you buy here will be worth it."}
{"text":"Everything we tried, savory and sweet crepes, quiche were amazing. The lemon crepe us unlike anything I have ever tried. The quiche was cooked perfectly. We will be back. And they carry Boylan sodas!!!!!  Nice clean restaurant!"}
{"text":"I suppose coming back 4 times in 4 days is probably a pretty good sign I liked this place.  We were on the hunt for pain chocolat and we were told this was the best place to get it.  Unfortunately they were sold out of pain chocolat at 1pm on Saturday, but I still walked out with an almond croissant which was delicious.  We came back the next day at noon and successfully purchased the pain chocolat!  The staff very helpfully wrote the reheating instructions on our takeout bag and the recommendations were spot on.   Next two times we came back for french baguettes.  We also got a napoleon which was also yummy with a delicious burnt sugar crunch.  A testament of how much better the baguettes are here is that I was \"forced\" due to time to get a baguette from the local Sprouts, I couldn't finish the baguette.   I only wish these guys were closer!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Every time I find a place that's great, I feel bad because then I know I will: 1) Spend more money; 2) Very possibly, gain unnecessary amount of weight; 3) Probably eat something I am intolerant to and give me some sort of reaction; 4) ALL WILL BE WELL WORTH!  Cafe Breizh is one of those places. The ambience is open, clean and uncluttered, without feeling sterile. The place is a gem! I could easily eat 5 croissants by myself. Yikes!"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes and croissants. We had the bacon and goat cheese crepe with a almond croissant and it was incredibly tasty and flavorful. We also had teas from their selection and they were also very good, although their true specialty is coffees."}
{"text":"After 8 months coming here regularly I just have good things to say about everything. I've never tried something that I didn't like and talking to the chef I understand why: everything is housemade, handmade with the finest ingredients, non-GMO. Simply delicious! It's french boulangerie/patissetie/creperie at its best!! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a well made pastry light, fluffy with high quality ingredients this is your place. Worlds away from the grotesque \"Dunkin Doughnuts\" type bakery.  This little gem of a place is exquisite and all so divine. I've been here twice and I'm never disappointed.  The butter is imported from France and the ingredients are all high quality. If you're like me and you love sweets but can't have them due to the discomfort after eating them this is your place. It reminds me of being in Europe where the pastries melt in your mouth.  I certainly will return.  5 starts effortlessly"}
{"text":"LE PETITE PATISSERIE! C'EST TRES MAGNIFIQUE!! Easily the BEST croissant ive ever had! The exact quantity of flakiness, perfectly glazed and delicious! I walked in today and the owners and customer was speaking French; for a second i got to pretend that i was in Paris. To the idiot who complained below: because you weren't assertive isnt thier fault. The quality of the food is amazing so come back and give them a try. I MORE than encourage all to come. This patisserie deserves so much!!"}
{"text":"This Cafe is really good. I felt so comfortable while walking in and customer service was very friendly. The pastries looked so amazing and delicious. Enjoy your breakfast or brunch with family and friends. They offer huge fresh made and baked crepes, croissants and cakes with a variety of coffee options from classic coffee to cappuccino and latte or teas and fruit juices. While enjoying my drinks, French music was running in the background and making a perfect feel of vacation and relaxation. Today I just ordered an iced latte and hot latte. Both were creamy and perfect. It's very clean and interior design is cute. Outdoor seating area is also provided. This definitely wasn't my last visit."}
{"text":"Welcome to France in Las Vegas! Puts all those croissants on the Strip to shame. I don't like Waldorf salad but I bought the sandwich just because it looked good and I really enjoyed it. Huge portion sizes, full coffee bar and plenty to choose from on the menu. A bit pricey. They have crepes, pastries, quiches, breakfast and lunch sandwiches. I can appreciate the hard work that goes into this place because you can see it.   Personally, I didn't like the choice of cheese for the cheesecake. It was not enjoyable and I rarely meet a cheesecake I don't like. Or maybe I didn't enjoy it because there was a short, brown hair baked into my slice (my hair is black). C'est la vie!"}
{"text":"Love this place  Everything is good and authentic  You don't have to go to France to enjoy French food just come to Breizh and you will have French food in Vegas."}
{"text":"My husband and I just enjoyed a savory and sweet crepe. Both were awesome! We are slowly eating our way through their menu. We were even offered to try a treat that will be offered in September. I do not want to give away the surprise, however I will say it is like heaven on earth.  This place has me screaming praises for the meals and pastries all the way home. I am already  looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I thought I would try out this new cafe and I am very happy I did! The interior is clean, minimal, and lovely. The menu was a little confusing for me as I'm not sure what the items were but the Chef showed me photos of all the sandwiches, etc. I ordered a latte with almond milk and it was good..the only way it could have been better is with a different almond milk company such as Califia Farms. Espresso was smooth and even a little chocolately flavored (maybe?). While I was in a woman returned complaining about her to-go coffee. Not sure what her issue was...maybe she's used to Starbucks? Thy accidentally didn't ring up a pastry I ordered and offered it to me for free. There may be a few kinks in service but the food was awesome and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is sooo nice. Its clean, the pastries are delicious!. We ordered nutella brioche, pain au chocolate, and the chocolate chip cookie and everything was not dissapoint!. I wish they have chocolate cake :)"}
{"text":"This is the best place in the city for Croissants and pastries! The product Pierre produces here is incredible! I doubt I'll be able to eat Croissants from anywhere else now!!! Be back soon!"}
