{"text":"OPA! What can I say I'm a Gal who loves her greek food... don't tell my Italian in-laws that. I went to Broken plate for the first time in Kensington a couple years ago now. Not going to lie I like this venue better. Aspen has better parking and much more space in general.

Had the lamb swords. They were amazing. Cooked exactly how I wanted it cooked Medium rare and portions were perfect. Of course it was on the expensive side however I don't often eat lamb and when I do I want it done right.

The lamb was very good in-fact if it was my first time eating it I would be hooked. However it wasn't and I was still super impressed. Our server was on her first day working and she was so great. I had some wine also recommended by our server and it was also very good. (it was a white wine... the name escapes me already) My mom dropped half her plate on the floor (don't ask how) and they whipped her up a new meal in no time and at no charge which I thought was very nice touch. Considering she made a mess! haha

Next time I will be back to break a plate for my birthday! OPA!"}
{"text":"I have only ever been to the location in Crowfoot, and I thought the food was really, really lacking. The cuisine was supposedly Greek, but there was a large assortment of things like ravioli on the menu. I've been told the Kensington restaurant is a totally different experience, and I hope to go there someday. Really though, if you want Greek food, go to Pegasus."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite places to go for dinner...last time we went my risotto was raw and they were trying to tell us it was al dente.  For the expense of the meal we won't be returning.  Really unfortunate, we loved this restaurant but it appears growth of the company killed the quality."}
{"text":"This one's a keeper in my little black book of go to restaurants! We dined at the Willow Park Village location and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, the friendly service and especially the food. Our meal started with the hummus and the eggplant and zucchini chips. Excellent beginning to the meal! From there we moved on to moussaka, the Mediterranean pasta dish with chicken, and the Alexander chicken sword. Tasty and enjoyable! 

Reservations highly recommended on weekends!"}
{"text":"Broken Plate came recommended by a Greek chef I met one night and my girlfriend heard they literally broke plates on Friday night at the restaurant. That wasn't true; the part about the breaking of the plates. Turns out they only do that for birthdays and other special occasions and Friday just doesn't cut it.
But the Greek chef was right. It is fantastic Greek cuisine in a well-decorated, nicely set-up restaurant. The place has a touch of class to it and the service was adequate. We waited a little long for the entree, but when it showed up, it was terrific. I had the Alexander Sword (beef souvlaki) and my girlfriend had hummus and dolmates. The beef was cooked and seasoned to perfection and served on a sword that was quickly removed by the waitress. The rice was moist and the grilled potatoes were perfect. There is something fantastic about tzaiki sauce on flame grilled meat.....
My girlfriend thought the dolmates were decent, but that the pita bread tasted like store-bought stuff. The prices were a little inflated as well, but all in all, it was a great meal and I'll be back again. And next time, I think I'll break a plate just for the hell of it."}
{"text":"This was a real let-down.

I had reservations for dinner tonight at 7:30.  We arrived a bit early, and the place seemed to be very chaotic.  We were seated at our table around 7:40, and within sixty seconds were asked for our drink order.  Give us time to read the menu!

We quickly skimmed things over and settled on drinks, a shared appy and two entrees.  While we waited complimentary rolls arrived.  At a Greek restaurant wouldn't pita bread be appropriate?  The buns we were served were very sweet and sugary, and would be better served with jam for breakfast.  Our cocktails arrived next, in teeny-tiny little glasses that were mostly full of ice.  A few sips later we were done.

And then we sat.  And then we sat some more.  Food seemed slow to leave the kitchen for everyone, not just our table.  Forty minutes after we ordered our spanakopita arrived- two little parcels of spinach and feta at a steep nine dollars.  It was decent, but not great, and not a good value.  We then waited another twenty minutes for our entrees to arrive.  I had the vegetarian trio, of which the restaurant should be ashamed.  It had two tiny portabello caps topped with spinach and feta (I'm not even convinced that was the cap of a portabello, it was so small), served with three TINY peppers, each stuffed with no more than a single tablespoon of plain rice, and a few roasted potato wedges on the side (I will say the potatoes were nicely crispy).  For fifteen dollars, any kitchen should be able to make a decent-sized vegetarian entree that includes quality ingredients (like actual-sized mushroom caps, and rice with some flavour!) and that is simply a larger portion.  It was a sorry excuse for a meal.  My friend ordered the skewer of beef, cooked medium.  It came out rare.  Not even medium-rare.  And the menu's \"market vegetables\" included (out of season) summer squash and bok choy.  How do you say bok choy in Greek?  And what makes out-of-season vegetables \"market\"?  

I'm giving this restaurant two stars because, while our meal was terrible and service was appallingly slow, it's nice to have a Greek restaurant in the area.  They could get a really good thing going here, but it's going to require more integrity in the kitchen and organization in the front of house.  Until I hear things have improved, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Decor was really hard to look at... especially with so many tables, crowds, and really dim lighting so I paid no attention to that.

Servers are really great people, they are humorous and really do tend to your every need!

Food was fantastic, I thought the food sizing was fair... small-medium sized bowls really fill a person up. I shared a Ionized Seafood pasta (I think that's what it was called) with my boyfriend, and we were both stuffed. However, the prices should not be so expensive, so I took off one star for that. As a group we got the flaming cheese... that was a cool show but honestly the cheese portion you get is very small, it resembles a piece of cheese pizza, but the small size is reasonable, since it is cheese!

Overall, a good Greek restaurant to go to if you want great food, and have some extra money to spend. And yes, they do break plates, you will usually hear tons of plates breaking on the plate-breaking days. If you want to break one, bring someone who is celebrating their birthday, or have a special occasion to announce. They give you fancy plates to break!"}
{"text":"Authentic Greek food, great atmosphere, service was top notch. We will be going back again and again. Opa!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our family dinner here.  My kids are just starting to appreciate food outside of the chicken nugget world so we took them to Broken Plate.  The food was excellent and my kids are now calamari fans.  Only downside, which I mentioned to our server (who was very attentive and helpful), were the holes in the upholstery where we were seated.  A very big hole where my husband sat!  I mentioned that this should be fixed and our waitress agreed.  She said basically that the corporate bureaucracy was holding up the repairs.  C'mon Broken Plate, get it fixed.  It is the first impression the diner has!"}
{"text":"I had some dalmates and moussaka last thursday and very sick the day after
Anyone like me?"}
{"text":"I had the calamari salad - I wasn't sure how it would turn out (fried calamari and salad dressing - soggy mess?) but it was absolutely delicious! The calamari were perfectly cooked and the ingredients tasted very fresh. The service was good, too.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner with family and friends. The service was good and the waiters made us feel looked after.  We were a large group and had an appetizer sampler to start and 2 of the fried cheese. The cheese was salty and delicious, from the platters the dolmathes and spanakopita were my favorites. I was really looking forward to the calamari but it ended up being rubbery/chewey. for my main I had a pasta dish with olives, tomatos, and feta (I can't remember what the name of the dish was). It hit the spot, and the price was right (it was likely the cheapest main, coming in at about $18). For dessert, I endulged in baklava. It was not to sweet but a bit \"gummy\" and difficult to cut. 

Overall, the food is good but a bit on the pricey side but it was great for a special occasion. I wished they had a house wine, the cheapest bottle was in the high 30's would have been nice if they had a house red and white to offer at a more resonable price. I might come back for another group event but not likely somewhere I would choose to go on a date.

Bonus - We were there on Saturday night so a few of the staff put on a show, dancing and breaking plates. Not the best entertainment I have seen in a Greek joint but hey, at least people were into it. They also let the birthday guest break a plate and that was a great bonus for our group."}
{"text":"It pains me to do this because of my roots, but my last visit at Broken Plate was just awful. The inside is kind of nice because it has a little bit of that cheesy charactured Greek look mixed with a modern clean look. You have the minimalist Parthanon-detailed columns throughout the restaurant, a Bouzouki above the bar and of course the fake white chimney where plates are broken throughout the night whilst the bellowing of \"Opa!\" is shouted. It's cute and endearing, but really stereotypical. 

That being said the space is very open and clean and it looks like a modern restaurant. So I thought it was a good balance. It is, however, very nosy inside. Not to mention the latest in Greek pop they play isn't exactly ... well what's the word ... good. I found there were more families there than couples so just know that it might be difficult to have an intimate conversation inside.

It took our server about 15 - 20 mins to take our drink orders after giving us menus. I can't say I have ever had that happen to me in my 5 years in Calgary. It's serving 101 to at least follow up with the table shortly to see if they want anything to drink. This was very strange and also a prelude of what was to come.

We had the Mussels Mediterraneo ($13) for an appetizer. And we ordered the Halibut ($26) and Lamb shoulder ($28). The mussels were pretty good. Had a tomoto based sauce with it which was decent. And then we waited for the main course. And waited. And waited. And waited. 

In fact, during this time nobody came by to see if we were ok. I was engaged with conversation with my friend so I didn't really notice until about 45 mins went by. Finally, a busser, not our waiter, came by to take our plates and ask us if everything was alright. I thought the main course was coming and the place was really busy so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and stated \"fine.\" So I continued conversing with my friend. Finally just over an hour passed and I finally got the waiters attention after several attempts. He told us that he messed up our order in the sequence they keep for the kitchen. ....\"What?\" I ejected. 1.5 hours later we were enjoying the meal. [insert sarcasm here]

I have never been to a restaurant in Calgary that has ever served me my main course an hour and a half from the order. Even if the entire kitchen was quadriplegic I don't think it would take that long. 

I guess I should feel some sympathy, but honestly it isn't rocket science here. My friend nor I were impressed and it led to a very uneasy relationship between us in the server for the rest of the night. His brilliant plan was to give us complimentary baklava at the end of it all. Yeah, totally made me feel better about it.

I am not a scholar in the ways of the server, but my guess would be great communication is part of the job. An awareness of how your table is doing is probably another. He had no idea about our situation. He never communicated with us for an hour and a half about our meal. In fact, I had to get his attention. 

The food was ok. However, I couldn't enjoy it at this point. For the price I paid both monetary and in time I might as well of cooked my own Greek food at home. You would be hard pressed to find me at Broken Plate ever again."}
{"text":"I just wrapped from a late lunch at The Broken Plate in Kensington and it's official -  I *LOVE* this place.

The service was excellent, the atmosphere was perfect and the food was delicious.

I'm a Tzatziki girl and I was very impressed with their version of it. Their vegetarian Pita Souvlaki was equally delicious, as was their Crema Brule.

The whole afternoon/evening felt like an adventure inside one of my all-time favourite flicks: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding.\"

Our server mentioned that on Friday and Saturday nights the staff dance and break plates, so you'd best be believin' that I'll be making a second appearance to get my 'OPA' on ;)"}
{"text":"This has to be my favourite Greek dining spot. It's friendly and easily accessible with plenty of parking near by. Not to mention that the calamari and lamb dishes are easily the best in the city. I don't know what the chef does to make these dishes so awesome but he sure knows his stuff. For anyone who loves Greek, and anyone on the search for calamari that isn't rubbery or lamb that isn't gamy, sauces and dips that just snap with flavour, and fresh crisp inventive vegetables and sides, this place is a must experience!!"}
{"text":"Since I can't figure out how to reply to you, Ric, I will do it as a preamble to my review: I appreciate innovation. In fact, there used to be a mediterannean restaurant on Edmonton trail that created truly updated fare...what many restaurants in Europe (as well as North America) are doing now...NOT cliche rehashes of traditional Greek Dishes. Innovation is not what you are doing my friend. I appreciate innovation, not mediocrity. Nice try at spin!

Original Review:

I have eaten more than my share of Greek Food, in many restaurants and Greek homes. It pains me when a Greek restaurant dishes up cliche after cliche in order to satisfy what they think a Western palatte will tolerate. I have also had my fill of \"opas\" and broken plates. I ask all my Greek friends if this is truly a Greek thing, and they all say that it is a show for the tourists, and that no one broke plates when they were growing up (at least not on purpose). When you see what has been coming out of restaurants in Greece in recent years, one can see how the cuisine is evolving.

Not here though. The dishes have not changed much from what has been served to \"Canadians\" in pseudo-Greek restaurants for the past 40 years. Some of the appetizers are quite good (dips etc.) so I will not give this restaurant a 1, but I would like to see more truly authentic (traditional and modern) dishes on their menu. When the restaurant first opened, there was a fantastic dish with shrimp and feta - flavourful! It was quickly dropped from the menu and replaced by something buttery and mediocre. This restaurant also decided to go the franchise route and opened up too many locations too quickly. The quality dropped.

I have gone three times, and will never go back...unless the restaurant reinvents itself. I challenge the Broken Plate to bring true Greek cuisine to Caglary and offer a few more contemporary dishes as well."}
{"text":"Just got here as Yelp says they are open, they are not open on Mondays... Will definitely come back I  love Greek food. 
So dissapointed... Will put 3 stars just for now will do a review, next time!"}
{"text":"\"OPAAAAA!\" they announce before a plate crashes down and shatters. Everyone cheers and claps...Truly is \"Smashingly Greek\"
Just a usual night at Broken Plate... With their large portions and enthusiastic staff, this place has a very celebratory vibe, making it a great place to toast accomplishments, birthdays, or just have great food and be merry. 

Their trilogy of dips (Tzadziki, Hummus, and Kopanisto) served with pita bread, compliment each other nicely. The Kopanisto in particular is a tastebud party, made from grilled red peppers and feta cheese. Can't go wrong with spanakopita either, and the Zeus' stuffed chicken is a meal fit for a king/queen... or a God/Godess?

Definitely DEFINITELY order Saganaki. They bring out a plate with a hunk of enticing cheese, then the waiter throws some brandy on it, and lights it on fire! It's so epic, and tastes unreal once the flames disappear.

There are food options for people of all; vegetarian, gluten-free, carnivores, etc. Such a great place to celebrate and have a fun dinner!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, excellent ambiance, great food.  Fantastic establishment.

We had lamb souvlaki and pork ribs.  Both amazing dishes - all the food on our plates were great.

A little bit on the pricey side, but good value for your dollar."}
{"text":"RESTAURANT CLOSED!!
What's going on with Broken Plate? Kensington closed, now Aspen Landing is finito. I don't understand...this place was always busy and the food was great.
Are the other locations closed too?
Bad management? money issues? Regardless of cause, it's a real shame. They had the best moussaka and calamari bar none. :-("}
{"text":"Easily the best Greek food in Calgary!

If you enjoy Greek food, then the Broken Plate is for you. Traditional Greek food paired with some delicious wines leads to an awesome night. We started off with the saganaki as well as a sampler plate. Saganaki is one of my favorite dishes and the one we were served did not disappoint! The meal I had following that was chicken stuffed with spinach and feta. It was also quite good.

If you enjoy Greek, get to the Broken Plate ASAP!"}
{"text":"Not sure whats up with all of the bad reviews! I actually had a great experience here last night. I've driven by MANY times as I live right up the road, but have never had the chance to eat here. After a frustrating flat tire debacle in the parking lot, my mom and I decided to duck inside for wine and dinner. We ordered the platter of appetizers and I later ordered a sword platter for my boyfriend (who joined us after changing said tire). Everything was awesome, the calamari on our platter was definitely the highlight, and the spanakopita was a close second. My boyfriend really enjoyed his meal and his lamb was cooked perfectly. Our waiter was great, attentive without being annoying, and the place was very quiet, so slow service was NOT an issue. I would not hesitate to eat here again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the years and it just keeps getting ... worse!!

If you like your food soaked in butter and oil you will like this.
We felt like we needed to squeeze the yuck out of our bodies when we left.

The rice literally smelled like cigarette smoke.
I'm sure it was the combo of spices but it was repulsive.
Mentioned it to waiter who went to kitchen and came back and admitted I was right.
He had never noticed that before.
Not a big deal, but weird eh! GaG!

I have always liked the Kensington location so I don't know why this location is so bad?!

Staff were nice and friendly.
Good service.
Son broke a plate for his birthday.

With the food so bad, it's tough to swallow the prices.

Overall, it is now on the Never Again list.
Unfortunate :-("}
{"text":"Came here about 2 weeks ago with another couple who raved about the Kensington location. Here is what I think of the Ranchlands location...n-OPA!

When you first step in, it seems like a decent place but boy was I wrong.  First off, our table was right next to the plate braking corner, that's right a corner, by the waiters station at the bar with glass everywhere and it couldn't possibly be safe to have shards all over the ground where the bar and our table was.  You would think there would be a designated place to smash dishes, like Mykonos?

Whatever, our waiter was a total tool.  Think Carson Kressley, but with less jazz and a try-hard personality (his lisp btw, was way over-kill).  He was totally sucking ass to the table next to ours and barely checking up on us, sorry, scratch that...asked us repeatedly if we wanted to drink (some people at our table did not drink booze, others didn't want wine till their meal arrived).  

We ordered a \"Greek\" salad, and our companions ordered the spanakopita.  Both were mediocre at best.  For a Greek salad, there were hardly any kalamata olives or feta and I didn't see a single herb in the mix, also the veg were pre-cut and stored in the fridge, a total no-no with tomatoes and onions, they turn to a wet mush and their texture is ruined (you could get away with this for cucumbers and peppers, working in a restaurant in the past taught me that).  The spanakopita was bland and nothing to rave about.  We thought the flaming saganaki looked cool so we ordered that too, total rip-off for $13.00, tiny portion, hardly enough for 4 adults.  And don't count on eating that cheese with bread!  We got one basket of 5 slices of stale French loaf!  No more bread came out the rest of the night, and no pita either...Greek, right?

Our mains took about an hour to come out after the starters and those were also just ok.  The beef skewers did not taste marinated only lightly salted with olive oil but the cut was decent.  Our friends ordered the chicken and it was bone-dry.  My beef was overcooked and my husbands was rare, we swapped plates.  I liked that they provided a little ramekin of tatzaki it helped out the meat (little being the key word here).  The potatoes were fantastic, the rice was tasteless and the veg, well, put it this way, bok choy, zucchini, asparagus and carrots, were lightly pan fried with zero herbs, or GARLIC, in fact I tasted no garlic in any of the starters or mains and this is supposedly Greek cuisine? Okaaaay.

I didn't make a stink about the lacklustre meal or service, I just will not be going back.   Lesson learned; you want to get a decent Greek fix, you are better off going to Opa!  Oh, and we weren't offered any plates to break either. I probably would have smashed mine over Carson's head.  n-OPA!"}
