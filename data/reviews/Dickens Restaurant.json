{"text":"Like Jennifer K's review, I too was a breakfast/lunch regular customer at Rural for a steady 8 years. Staff is the same, and they've upgraded their interior finishes but what disappointed me the most is the dish I have always ordered is no longer available.   So what to expect: slight price increases, a different, almost smaller menu selection, tighter eating space (since they only own half the original rural restaurant size now), and because of that a short wait time since there are still customers that like eating there and it gets full.  For me, I mentioned earlier that I 'was' a regular because I am definitely not going back to Dickens.  So if there's anyone that knows another place that has a similar menu to the old Rural, please post and let me know!"}
{"text":"At first I thought...Dickens moved here??? Turns out it's a different Dickens completely unrelated to the former branches in Midland/Finch and Richmond Hill.  Anyway I went for dinner, had the dinner for two plus a dinner for one specials. Comes with New England Clam Chowder soup...which was anything but chowder. Very diluted taste too...  The dinner for two came with baked crab shells and two steaks. The crab shells and one of the steaks were actually quite good. The second steak, however, was overcooked. The dinner for one was ox tail in red wine sauce with fettuccine. Not bad...heavy portions though. The red wine sauce could have a bit more taste, but that's about it.  Iced coffee/milk tea mix tasted good. Iced lemon tea was too bitter...not sweet enough.  Dessert was a fruit medley, with cantaloupe, blueberries, grapes, oranges, etc.  Overall I would rate this a 2.5/5, however I gave it a 3 as the waitresses were very attentive of us and asked us to give our honest opinions on the strengths and weaknesses of the food and how to improve. That's what I call good customer service, and for that they get a 3/5."}
{"text":"One day it is Rural Restaurant http://www.yelp.ca/biz/rural-restaurant-scarborough?fsid=TUoKueIKfpmnj8QDN4z5Wg... Now it is Dickens Restaurant.  I am not really sure how this location is related to the other Dickens up at Richmond Hill... But the staffs are still the same one from Rural Restaurant... The decoration is similar, the restaurant is just half the old restaurant. Menu is different for sure, as there are less choices for Afternoon Tea at a slightly higher pricing...  Butter/Condensed Milk Toast and Coffee/Tea ($2.50) is definitely not a bad price..but only when your toast has hardly any Condensed Milk and your drink is small and taste lurk warm?   Service is the same Hong Kong Style Cafe norm...   I don't know... I might have to look for other options...  Though now they are opening late till 9 pm everyday and serves breakfast from 7:30 am...  Just maybe... I maybe back...."}
