{"text":"This is the most authentic a Yemeni food could get. The rice is favorable and the meat is tender. The Mandi is the best and to die for. The goat is also delicious. Huge portions so make sure you're hungry as each plate is a feast! 

The prices are super reasonable and the owners are humble people who come to your table and serve you. Hall on the wall place with a memorable experience. Must try!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've missed this until today!  I make pretty good rice but theirs is the best I've ever had. Basmanti, each grain separate and exquisitely flavorful with subtle spices.  I don't usually think of rice as the star of the meal, but this rice is amazing.  The hummus was lovely and the baba ghanoush the best I've ever had. Again, perfectly balanced delicate spices.  I had the gyro plate and look forward to the goat, the lamb and the biryani.  Can hardly wait to visit again!  Oh, and the staff are very warm and friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite Middle Eastern restaurant in Tempe with great customer service."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. First and foremost--this place was very dirty. Carpets desperately needed to be vacuumed between customers. Desperately need to get the carpets professionally cleaned as well. Found hair on the tables. People also felt free to walk across tables on the ground since their shoes were off. Second, food was good but half of the meat (lamb mandi) was all fat. Rice did not seem fresh. We went on a Friday night so everything should have been on point. We definitely wont go back. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Great food!  Fun atmosphere!  We will definitely be back!  Try the gyros and the goat mandi!  Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I cannot stress how excellent the food is here!  I got the goat rice and it's one of the best goat rices that I've had.  The goat itself was tender, flavorful, and fell right off the bone.  The rice was very flavorful and didn't get old.  The sauces were just the right amount of spiciness and flavor to add to the dish without becoming overwhelming.  I'm seriously champing at the bit to go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time yesterday, loved chicken mandi and fahsa, they also offer a variety of Arabic beverages"}
{"text":"Greek delivered to the door, for that they get 3 stars. Food was not very good, the gyro meat did not appear to be shaved off the spit, rather Prepackaged like something out of a grocery store."}
{"text":"Great food !!! 

the lamp is delicious. 

The best middleeasren food in Tempe ..
I recommend it to everyone ... Perfect , clean , awesome staff ,and friendly ... 


LOve it sooo much"}
{"text":"The only thing that I ever get here is the goat, lamb mendi or a combo of both. The lamb is amazing, it simply falls off the bone. I will probably try other things on the menu but for now I'm content. I recommend anyone that like lamb or goat to give this place a try. I've made this regular stop every couple weeks."}
{"text":"This place has goat on rice the same way they serve it in the Middle East and they don't waste ice by putting it in your water this place is very authentic"}
{"text":"If you like baba ghanoush then you will LOVE this one! Best baba I have ever had! From the texture to the subtle seasoning then right into the little bits of garlic...Yummmmmm! Definately on my favorite places list."}
{"text":"Isn't it great when you find food from Yemen all the way in the valley? I sure felt glad! 
Having lived in Dubai all my life, I grew up fond of this kind of food, Mandi, Mathbi, Madfoon, Bukhari, etc. Yemeni and Saudi food in Dubai was and still is very popular and is known for delicious taste, huge portions, and very reasonable (sometimes even cheap) prices. 
We were referred to this restaurant by a family member. Not sure how she found out about it bcz she never tried it so far but we, my husband and I, decided to give it a shot and head there. We arrived at around 12:45pm. We expected to find some people when we walked in but it was empty. Not a problem. The first thing that I would say is probably the only major negative in this place is the smell. My husband was about to take me some where else bcz I was getting uncomfortable. As you walk in, you are hit with a strong smell of cleaning chemicals that do not smell good at all. I am not sure what the reason is but I decided to just ignore the smell and order and go in as soon as possible bcz the smell was mostly only at the entrance. 
I ordered the goat mandi and my husband ordered the lamb with rice dish. We were asked to pick a seat either on the table or in the traditional Arabic section and they would bring out the food. We also were offered to get our drinks from the fridge. 
We decided to sit in the Arabic Jalsa area since there was no one there. The food came out in a reasonable time - about 10 min and it looked great. The meat was in the center of the dish with some browned onions on top, both dishes looked very inviting. The food was served with a lime wedge, some cucumber yogurt and a green chili sauce on the side. We dug in and the food was delicious! I was so glad at that point that my husband did not insist on making us leave and that I was able to survive the entrance and try this good food. The meat was delicious and very tender and the rice was cooked to perfection. Portion size as always in these restaurants was just right. Having not had breakfast, I finished my dish and of course my husband did too. 
After eating this great meal we left feeling drowsy lool, a typical feeling after you have such a good big rice meal  
We paid at the entrance just before we left and the price was $39 for 2 dishes and 2 drinks. Slightly on the expensive side but not too bad. 
I hope they will find a solution for the smell in this place because the food and the service are so good, it would be a shame if ppl decide not to come in because of that."}
{"text":"Best Falafel in town. 

The chef said he grids it himself in house. The flavor, was robust and full of garlic. The peta bread and romaine lettuce in the pita were nothing special the sprinkling of aleppo pepper was a nice touch. 

The first thing you will notice when you walk in for lunch is 1. an amazing aroma of spices 2. a pile of cushions from dinner, don't worry they are open 3. a empty counter (don't worry they are making food and will get to you)

I can not wait to go back and try other dishes, which will be hard as the alure of the falafel is making my mouth water and filling my dreams as I write thing"}
{"text":"It was delicious - super flavorful! I had the goat meat with rice and salad delivered to my office. Everyone was jealous!"}
{"text":"The portion size and selection on the menu are stellar! So is the service and general environment of the place. Goat mandi to biryani to salad, everything is worth trying!"}
{"text":"The food is Ok, but overpriced for the portion they provide. The service is not good at all. No napkin, No water. And we have to ask for forks and spoons to eat our food! Remember to bring ur own napkin and water if you want to try this place!"}
{"text":"I passed by this restaurant going to college and decided to give it a try as I saw it was Halal. I went in and the young lady at the counter was really sweet and had such a welcoming smile. It was my first time eating Yemen cuisine and it was really yummy and flavorful. Much better than other Middle Eastern restaurants in the area. It was pricey but the portions are good. I really really loved the Boneless Chicken Entree! The chicken was so flavorful and cooked really tenderly. Went again the next day to get it again. It was take-out both times so I don't know much about the service. But I would definitely recommend it to everyone. It is in such a small hidden restaurant, it needs more recognition!!!"}
{"text":"The meat here is the best in Tempe area. One of the places that serves the original Arabic food. Would recommend the lamb meat."}
{"text":"Aww YS! I love how Tempe is growing to be a community of different backgrounds and cultures, and no greater manifestation of this can be shown by the food that is offered here. I had never had cuisine from Yemen before so I was excited to go on a food journey and try some dishes. The restaurant itself is very nondescript and the overhead signage simply says \"Restaurant\". The name of the restaurant is plastered on the front glass walls and on a sidewalk sign though. 

The interior is similarly nondescript, with tables and booths in the front although there does look to be a nice area in the back where people can sit on cushions and eat on a low table. The menu offers various Middle Eastern dishes you will find at other restaurants such as falafel and shawarma but also has a few unique offerings you won't find elsewhere in Tempe. After finding out that  fahsa/salteh (Lamb stew) was the national dish of Yemen, I knew I needed to try it out!

It arrived scorchingly? hot, so I needed to wait a bit for it to cool down before trying any. I ended up trying a few bites of falafel, hummus and rice from my husband's plate while I waited. I found the to be hummus smooth and creamy, the falafel crisp on the outside with a good texture and flavor on the inside, and the rice to be soft and well seasoned. The stew was so good; I can see why it would be called the national dish! It was bold and spicy, yet had a comforting homey feel to it from the slow cooked, soft lamb to the thick rustic broth. It was served with some pieces of pita. 

Note that they don't seem to offer any glasses of water. All the water is by the bottle in 2 drink cases to each side of the counter. There is also a selection of American and Middle Eastern sodas to choose from. When I asked if they offered cups of water the cashier said they did but when the server dropped off our food and I asked for a cup of water he brought me a bottle of water. 

Our server also neglected to give us any silverware for our meal which I had to remind him to provide to us. Service in general was genial though and we were checked up on as needed. 

That lamb stew was so good I'd definitely be back to try more Yemen style cuisine. In my opinion, definitely say Yes to YS!"}
{"text":"As we were up in the Phoenix area for the day, Mom and I decided to check out some of the cuisine offered there that was not as available down South here in Tucson.  We stumbled across the postings for this place, and as we had never had Yemeni food before, we thought that it would be ideal.  YS Restaurant is located on the Northeast corner of Rural Road and University Drive in Tempe, Arizona, right near Arizona State University.  There is a parking lot on that corner behind the buildings that line the intersection of Rural and University that abuts the restaurant entrance.

Having read the previous Yelp reviews, we knew the drill for this establishment.  On our way in, we snagged menus off the counter before seating ourselves at a booth.  There was an area in the front of the restaurant where one could sit on the floor on cushions in the traditional Arab-style, but we really didn't feel like being that authentic.  Drinks were in two refrigerated cabinets, and I walked over and picked out soft drinks for the two of us.

When the very nice and helpful young lady who was behind the counter came over to take our order, we were ready.  She asked if we had any questions about the food, but we had already made up our minds.  Mom decided to have the Lamb Shank, and I went for the Goat Meat.  The entrees were ready very quickly, and she brought them right out to us.

Goat is a rich and slightly unctuous meat, a bit like Oxtail, with bones like the latter for which one has to watch out.  Here it is served on a generous bed of Yemeni-seasoned Basmati rice with two sauces, an Arab form of Tzatziki and a chili-spiced hot sauce.  It flavour was simply delicious.  Mom was equally pleased with her Lamb Shank.  It was falling-off the bone, and she noted that it was some of the tenderest lamb that she had ever tasted.  When we talked to the young woman again after the meal, when she was, also, kind enough to snap a photo of both of us, she told us that the lamb was cooked for three to four hours and that some of the spices for the rice were imported all the way from Yemen itself.

All in all, our first experience with Yemeni food was a great one.  This feeling seems to have been shared with the Middle Easterners who were eating there, too, who appeared to be enjoying their meals whilst dining in the Arab manner.  We were especially pleased that the proportions of the delicious rice and the meat were enough to merit bringing some home in a doggie-box in order that we could have another meal later.  If you live or are visiting up in the Phoenix area, YS Restaurant is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"One of the best yummy Mediterranean foods I have ever tried in Arizona , special lamb mandy"}
{"text":"It was a really good experience. All the Indians will like it for sure. Food tasted really good especially the rice which tasted similar to biryani. Chicken tasted really tender, soft and tasty. Most importantly the cost is so reasonable. I would definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Love this place. One of best Arabic food restaurant in the area. And the owners are so nice. Highly recommended. Try the lamb"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 5 for lunch and we were the only table with people. The service was definitely sub-par. The owner seemed surprised when we came in. Maybe white women aren't expected to be interested in Yemeni food. The food was good and everybody was happy with it (we mainly ordered chicken shawarma, which was good but a little dry. I dipped it in the hummus (which was FABULOUS). Would love to have tried the lamb or the fish, but they are seriously expensive and since they group was buying me lunch I didn't want to make them go that high!

Their drinks were limited to bottled drinks and it sounded like they weren't really set up for normal business yet. No iced tea (except Arizona tea in bottles). 

Most disturbing: I don't know what they cleaned the floor with; it looked clean but every step your shoes stuck to it a bit. Also, there's a serious safety hazard (a broken floor outlet) which needs to be fixed before somebody breaks an ankle."}
{"text":"Superb. I wonder how did I miss this restaurant these many days. Would definitely come back here. Friendly staff. On demand spicy food. Highlight was the sitting arrangement. You can sit down on cushions with handrests by your sides. Best place to be if you are in a mood of Mediterranean. We had chicken kebab platter. Totally satisfying. :)"}
