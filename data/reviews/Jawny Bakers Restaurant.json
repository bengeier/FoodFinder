{"text":"Food is ok but not that great.  Nice patio and the servers are friendly and attentive.  Prices are ok but I'd rather go to The Keg for steak as the quality of beef is much better and worth the extra few $."}
{"text":"Nice place,  warm and inviting.  We sat on the outdoor patio which overlooks a ravine.  The servers were friendly but slow in coming to our table to check if we needed anything else.  They served complimentary rolls which was nice, the food was good.  I had the chicken parm.  Food is fresh which was nice over the usual frozen, the menu is too big and a bit confusing jumping all over the place and it's definitely over priced.   Overall liked it but not likely to repeat due to slow service and overpriced menu."}
{"text":"Best Eggs Benedict in Toronto. Only available on weekends from 11:30am to 3:00pm. Delicious! The hollandaise is homemade, rich and velvety. I like to get an order of sausage on the side ( proper breakfast bangers).  This is a family run business that pays attention to detail. I've never noticed a blemish on a slice of lemon or orange garnish and was not surprised to find out that the produce is hand picked by the patriarch. A great find and a hidden gem well worth the drive from any part of the city."}
{"text":"I.lOVE.THIS.PLACE... just wanted to start with that. I live walking distance from this place, I pass it everyday. Last night my boyfriend and I just after 11pm decided to try it. It wasn't too busy but that's fine with us. We took a seat in the lounge area and the menu seemed a bit expensive but we ordered anyway. Since it was late we shared the full rack of ribs with fries, and vegetable sides. While we waited we received delicious warm ciabatta buns with whipped butter. The paper funnel that it was in just charmed me. It had names of many East York local streets on it, I just loved that attention to detail. The service and ambiance was nice. The food was amazing! My boyfriend doesn't like to eat out a lot and is a picky eater.. but he was raving about even the mushrooms and vegetables being amazing, the sweet potato fries. We wanted to save some food for tomorrow, but no, impossible! We couldn't stop eating it, that's how good it was. Everything was fast and fresh. To top the great food and service, we got a gift certificate for for our next visit! I'm done.. I was knocked out, going back soon ...."}
{"text":"Since my son was born we haven't gone out to dinner too much with him. But this week we had a relative in town and we decided to go out for a casual dinner in our hood. A few of the dads in the hood recommended JB's.  I have driven past this place 100 times and not once did I think \"hey that looks like a great place to eat\". Appearances can be deceiving. The food quality was great. I had an amazing Lobster Cob salad and the rest of my party really enjoyed their meals.   Right on the menu they claim to be one of the best kid friendly restaurants (recommended in Today's Parent magazine). JB's had a kids menu with the normal items you would see in Jack Astors etc.   The great part was it was Friday night and the place was loaded with kids, so you didn't feel guilty when something spilled on the floor, or your child was squealing at high pitch intervals.   I would have given the place 5 stars but the service was a little off, a few things were forgotten when ordered and had to be asked for again.   JB's also had a nice patio out back and the most important....Guinness on tap!   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went here for my moms bday this past Tuesday. I got something on their specials menu called a choi mei bowl or something. A fusion of noodles and salad with beef, crispy onion straws and nuts with a nice Asian sauce. This all came in a nacho like bowl that was edible. The presentation was cool and the food tasted good. My mom got a steak salad with blue cheese that she's had there before and liked. Apparently something bothered her this time around and was in the bathroom all night. I also got a creme brule... I know I should not have expected much but ... DO NOT get the creme brule. Horrible. Anyways. Service was good, the waitress was super helpful. Didn't even charge me for my horrible creme brule or my moms bday pie. The manager came around at one point and we tried to joke around with him.... No smile whatsoever. Apparently he's like that every time. Not cool. But other than that I liked it. Cozy environment too"}
{"text":"I go here regularly with family or friends. Always have a good time! Great food, great service, nice atmosphere, family oriented. Love the place!"}
{"text":"This place has been around a long time and I moved back to the area a few years ago. I first came here over 15 years ago and from what I remembered it was ok. Well take us to 2016 and Jawnys is not ok.   I came in here and ordered the Jawny burger.and fries. Usually if you name a menu item after your restaurant that should be your signature dish. Well if that was their best item than don't bother.   This tasted like a frozen Presidents Choice angus burger with toppings. Don't get me wrong the PC burger is really good for a premade burger. But when you are charging $18.50!!! for this burger I don't think I'm out of line for expecting a freshly ground burger.   The Harbord Room downtown has arguably the best restaurant burger in Toronto. It is a freshly ground dry aged beef burger for $19 and guess what? This burger is named after the restaurant as well. But in this case the burger lives up to the name.   So it's Jawnys frozen burger for $18.50 or splurge the extra 50 cents and get the best burger in Toronto.   I would have given Jawnys a one. But the service was very good. It's a nice local restaurant with a good family atmosphere. But the quality of food for the price does not add up.  Topham Grill and Ginger Man are both within a 5 min drive and offer much better food and value. That does not bode well for the future of Jawnys."}
{"text":"We went with a friend and the meal was ok - lots of other happy people though.  My main complaint is that everything was super-salty, I couldn't finish mine and tried the other two dishes, also terribly salty. A steak; chicken wings; jambalaya.   Just a heads up to people who have hypertension or renal disease, maybe you can ask for it to be less salty but it didn't occur to me that any cook would ever salt to that degree in the first place."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Food is always so damn good. I love the little lounge/bar area they have - makes me feel classy! :)"}
{"text":"Being that we are fortunate enough to have close access to all the unique dining experiences that living in Toronto brings, dining at the commercial big-box joints are not our thing.  I admit I am a food snob, and I've been known to say that the big-box joints employ 'cooks' not 'chefs' and the food certainly reflects that in those places. For a while we avoided JB's because we thought it was looked a little too 'Boston-Pizza-ish'.  Then a neighbour of ours had nothing but compliments to say, so we ventured in...and we were not disappointed! The service is fantastic, and while the size of the resto and menu appear similar to those big-box types, the food is all homemade, well executed and just DAMN TASTY! Kobe meatloaf, ribs, burgers were all a hit with our family!"}
{"text":"Great place, great patio. Food is good and service exceptional."}
{"text":"Our family use to eat at this restaurant quite regularly but this was the first time we ate here this year. The waitress was terrific but the food was very disappointing.  We ordered nachos, wings, burgers.  Everything we ordered was overcooked. Our nachos chips were actually burnt when they arrived. The wings are usually great but this time they we overcooked and dry. We will have to find another family restaurant because this dinner was a waste of our money."}
{"text":"This restaurant is family oriented and the meals are very tasty. A tad on the pricey side, but I always recommend this place to everyone in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, the first my mom got a bonus so she took us all out for dinner. We all had steak, mine was fine as was my boyfriends but her steak was ice cold and had to be sent back. The did apologize and got her a new plate, do not remember however if we received any discount because of this. Second time I went was for brunch, I had an omelette, it was HUGE and good in the tum. We went with a few other ladies, one of which said it was \"ok\" but I think she's just a food snob. Third time me and my boyfriend went we both loved our dinners, I had the mushroom and swiss burger and we shared the B.B.Q. Chicken Salad, this by far was the best thing I've eaten here. However, I am an all time lover of salad and it really hit the spot. Service is good most of the time, the server we had for brunch was great, really mellow guy, good to joke with. If you go there's no doubt you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner last night after driving by the place for years.  Very pleasantly surprised.  Excellent and friendly service, good food.  Varied menu that hits all the high points. We sat in the bar area and really liked the vibe.  Nice ambiance.  Next time we want to sit beside the fireplace. Great attention to detail and you get the feeling everyone  there really cares that you are enjoying yourself.  We tried the steak salad and a thin crust chicken pizza.  Both were very tasty and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My first time there was last night with my buddy Konst. He lives in the area and swears by their wings.   When I walked in I was immediately impressed with the decor of the place and organization of the staff. It's nothing fancy but it looked great.   We sat at the bar area and ordered some drinks (Guinness on tap, check!). We chatted for a bit and orders some hot wings with sweet potato fries. I wish I brought my camera because the presentation of the food was very appealing.   Both the fries and wings were really tasty. The wings were a good size, not too big like the ones you get in Buffalo or at some sports bars. The location is a bit out of the way, but if you live in the east end of Toronto, it is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is where I go for business meeting with my partner. The ambience at the perfect. Nice place to grab a beer and some good food."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this once great family restaurant. They lost the plot somewhere opting to cut corners to save money at the expense of taste, quality and overall value. An indication of client indignation is the emptiness of the place since they ratcheted down the flavours at this once favourite East York diner. Their once famous fajitas are now flavourless rubber chunks of chicken with brown avocados pretending to be guacamole and what happened to the amazing bread they served with every meal ? They now charge for slices of old french loaf smothered in an oily concoction reminiscent of the 1950s garlic bread. This is not just a one time visit. I have been trying to give it \"another chance\" for a year now after my wife and many Neigbours swore it off long ago. No I did love you JB's but almost all of your food has changed. I can't explain it other than your cutting corners and the only thing it's achieving is an echo in your once wonderful place. I will miss you, but it's time to say goodbye."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we come here during the summer and sit on the patio. Tucked in the back by the ravine, it was a great place to have a few drinks (although as dusk hit, we were eaten by mosquitos and retreated to the comfy booths inside).  I went back recently to try more food. Really liked having such choice from the gluten free menu... opted for the bacon wrapped scallops to start. Thought the scallops were a tad overcooked. The chicken and shrimp linguini was good; gluten free pasta was cooked the way I like it. There was a bit too much oil in the pesto, but it was very tasty.  I'll definitely go back to try some more items off the menu. Bonus points for free parking in the back, and the lovely fireplace that kept us warm. It has real cozy atmosphere to it."}
{"text":"I don't know, I was really looking forward to Jawny Bakers. The menu looked good, it has lot parking in the back, it was close-by, but it just didn't work.  The service was good, our server was a young lady who was courteous and prompt. Ordered a blue cheese pasta and chicken madeira. The pasta was very heavy and the chicken was kind of dry and lacked flavour. I wish there were more onions cause those were great!   Anyway, maybe we'll try it again, maybe not. I wish it was better cause it looks great. The bill came to $46 for just the two entrees ..which we didn't really enjoy."}
{"text":"I'd actually give this place a 3.5 if I could.   Drove by here dozens, if not hundreds of times when I lived in East York several years ago.  For some reason, since I couldn't see much through the windows, I wrongly assumed it was a dark, bland, blah kind of dingy place.  I was wrong.  It's a nice, cozy, warm atmosphere...woody decor, with a good-sized bar on your left when you come in, a small fireplace, and actual natural light coming in.  Maybe 20 tables in total?  But I didn't go in the back to see.  The visit where I finally tried it was on a hot Canada Day for lunch with friends who live in the neighborhood, and they recommended it after having been here many times.  Otherwise, it probably wouldn't have crossed my mind.  I think we were the first group to arrive around 11am (technically we were aiming for brunch, but since it was a holiday, only part of their brunch menu was available.)  The host/server who greeted us right away was very friendly.  I wanted to try the Mediterranean version of Eggs benny on the brunch menu, but he mentioned that there was no hollandaise sauce prepared that day, so I scratched that option.  One of my friends wanted the home fries, but those weren't available either, so we weren't off to the best start in terms of choice.  But I ended up ordering the Grilled Vegetable Sandwich (Grilled Zucchini, Roasted Red Pepper, Hummus, Red Onion, Goat Cheese with Tomato, Garden Greens, Pesto Mayonnaise on Naan).  GIANT with lots of flavor, a bit messy to eat, but I don't see the price on the online menu for it.  Free bread served warm & fresh out of the oven with butter.  Two of the guys in our group ordered burgers, and I forget which ones unfortunately, but both were happy with their choices.  Another vegetarian in our group had a customized salad because she doesn't enjoy a lot of food items, so asked for a plate of various things, which they made without issue, and she enjoyed.  Her only complaint was the mimosa she ordered to drink, didn't seem very bubbly, more like orange juice and wine.  The menu here overall is quite bit and I would go back anytime to try something else."}
{"text":"WHAT HAPPENED?!?!?!  The food used to be sooo good.  The prices reasonable.  I moved and came back after 2 years and WHOA!   Bad food and outrageous prices!!! Spoke to some people and they all said the same thing. JB's went downhill big time. So sad.  Was such a great place  a few years ago."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant a few times because it is a so-called \"family restaurant \". Took my two small children here for lunch. My son had a meltdown and while I was dealing with him, the rude manager came over and told us to keep it down because people were trying to enjoy their lunch. Instead of understanding that sometimes kids cry and parents are doing the best they can to deal with it, he came over to shame us. So very surprised that this \"family friendly\" establishment would treat customers this way. I will definitely not be going back there."}
{"text":"Service is bizarre. Ordered food and after waiting ten minutes stopped my server and asked where it was only to be told that she had been asked to wait to punch it in because the kitchen was backed up."}
{"text":"My wife and 2 young daughters went here on Friday evening. The service is always good and kid friendly. On this trip, our pizza came out very over done and they replaced it without us even having to ask. If you are looking for a family friendly restaurant with good food, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Ouch! After years of decent food, this place has really taken a nose dive.  Was there a recent management change?  Not sure, but it ain't the same place any more.  Tonight the chicken wings were the smallest wings I ever, ever had.  They were the size of the last two digits of my pinky finger.  The were small enough to scream \"Clearly, no one ever orders these a second time.\"  They were ordered hot but they arrived with sweet bbq sauce that had no trace of heat.  My caesar was similarly bland and tasted as if they've started watering down the clamato juice.  Ribs were a bit bland but nicely cooked.  Pizza was tough.  It wasn't just the crust that was tough, the cheese itself was also tough.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing they've found a way to use really cheap cheese to match the rest of the meal.   Bread was offered but never arrived.  Mashed potatoes were served without butter.  The most recent menu has fewer vegetarian options than ever .  We counted one pasta dish, 0/5 salads, no burgers. So if you have a vegetarian in your party, this place is not the option it used to be.  Another big turn off - they've changed their wait staff outfits for the slutty skirt and deep cleavage look.  At an after-work pub, I love a flash of cleavage with my pint. But at this family restaurant with kids at many tables, it just feels weird and the women just look uncomfortable.   Goodbye Jawny Bakers.  I will miss having a nice family restaurant in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"A neighbourhood pub, which has apparently been around for sometime and a mainstay of the area. The place is quite large, a unique layout, and the decor is nice - almost gives the feel of a Keg-type steakhouse, but with a lot of natural light.  The menu however is right on par with a typical neighbourhood restaurant. In fact, you'd swear you were in a chain restaurant, though I'm fairly sure this is the only Jawny Bakers out there. There's not too much interesting on the menu, and it's your fairly standard: soup, sandwich, pasta, ribs... type food. Perhaps they know their client base, and this is what they want, but to me, this felt like a menu I'd see 15+ years ago. Moreover, the taste is a bit like that too, since clearly not everything is prepared in house - the burger being from a frozen patty for example.  It's not to say the food is poor, but it's just ok. That, along with pretty good service, cheap lunch specials, and nice ambience makes it's it a pretty good experience - but nothing beyond that."}
{"text":"- love the patio that overlooks a pretty ravine - yummy food"}
{"text":"Visited Jawny Bakers again last night and was pleasantly surprised to find they now have the option to order gluten free pasta or sandwich bread. Awesome!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine lives close by and has always passed on it considering from the outside it looks like just another pub. We were instantly impressed by the decor and ambiance. The staff was immediately amiable.  The menu was also a very pleasant surprise. Not verbose but containing a good selection a rung or two above pub fair. I was also surprised by the gluten-free section.  My friend has a deathly allergy to nearly all fruits and veg, and eating out for him is incredibly hard, but the staff were far more attentive to his needs than I or he have ever seen anywhere else.  The pot pie was quite good but needs tweaking. Their Alfredo sauce was top-tier, their milkshakes were very good and their tea selection was surprisingly varied.  This is a definite resto to return to."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for my birthday dinner before knife throwing. It's nice restaurant in the East York area. They were very accommodating for my party size and even let us use their private party room despite not having the required number of people for it. They had a rack of ribs special with a side for $20 so everyone decided to order that. We got the Jack Daniels sauced ribs and it was pretty good. There was a good amount of meat on the ribs and it was a good portion. Overall, it was a nice dining experience. Staff were friendly and they have a pretty decent dinner menu. Would definitely recommend if you happen to be around the O'Connor/Danforth area."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant my now husband took me too.  He has been going to jawny's since he was a teenager. We always enjoy sitting in the bar area. I have to say the food is great my faves include the Bombay chicken curry and there wood oven baked pizzas. But they truly have something for everyone. The atmosphere is great! I will continue to go there as much as I can as long as I live in there east end."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. Beats franchise ones like Kelsey's or Boston pizza any day. I had the pizza which was thin and tasty and my husband had the ribs and wing combo which was also very good and portion was huge. And they have carlsberg on tap! Excellent restaurant if you have kids since they have a special kids section that families can sit in. I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"The staff were extremely wonderful. I came with a group of business associates on Saturday evening. We were greeted and seated right away. We never waited more than a minute to get our drinks and the food was delivered promptly. I had the Malibu chicken sandwich. Huge portion. It was cooked to perfection. I wouldn't have changed a thing. It was that good. The sweet potato fries were a perfect accompaniment.   I also enjoyed the dining room. It was casual but chic.  We felt comfortable to stay for a good hour, and not rushed in any way. I would come back if I'm ever back in the neighborhood. Excellent service, food, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is average at best, prices are reasonable.   We went there last night and ordered Nachos as an app and pizza as out main. The pizza came out and was luke warm, the dough was dry and tasteless. The nachos were your standard nachos but I found the guacamole to be very bland.   The service was quite good and everyone agreed the desserts were quote good."}
{"text":"If I lived in Toronto I would eat here a lot. Not only is it unique among restaurants in my experience in the extensive gluten-free menu, but they also offer draft cider. And the food is great, across the board. The entire place looks comfortable, and the deck looks great - I'm sure it's a fantastic place to hang in the summertime."}
{"text":"Jawny's has unfortunately jumped the shark. Used to be you could justify their premium prices (easily the highest priced restaurant for quite a few blocks) with their fantastic food. Doesn't seem to be the case anymore. My last couple visits have been pretty mediocre.  The most recent...chicken parmigiana swimming in a bowl of grease and spaghetti with canned sauce (my palette is by no means refined so the fact I could tell it was from a can should say something).  This spot always fit a sort of midway point between a sports bar and fine dining. Just a little bit more upscale than Boston Pizza or Kelsey's while still feeling casual enough. But it's definitely lost it's luster. The writing is definitely on the wall as Saturday evening they weren't even half full. Unfortunate as they have one of the best patios in the city. Hopefully they pull up out of this nosedive.   Service though, I must say, is always excellent. Too bad they don't have a good kitchen to back them up anymore. Enjoy a drink on the patio but don't expect much from the food."}
{"text":"We wanted a tasty lunch with the kids in tow,  and were pleasantly surprised when we got here. We weren't relegated to the usual junk fed to kids in family restaurants. Even my ginger beef crunch salad was the talk of the table and delicious. Tons of high quality beer on tap, great diversity in the menu, and even the kids food was top notch. Loved that my kids' grilled cheese sandwiches were made of quality multi-grain bread and real cheese. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had the TO Burger and a side of Caesar salad.  Most underwhelming burger ever. Thought it was a freesbie between two pieces of stale bread.   Two stars was for the covered patio that backs into a tree-lined ravine.  Might be good location for beer and fries but not real food."}
{"text":"Went to this place with a group for lunch today. There was an extremely large and loud group also there, so they were nice enough to allow us to sit in the unused private room.  We ordered a number of appetizers which were good, but nothing stood out. The bread was delicious.  I had the barbecue chicken salad which was good and one of the healthier options - so I splurged on apple crisp for dessert. The apple crisp was warm and served with high quality vanilla ice cream.  Overall a good meal, good service, excellent company."}
{"text":"We came here for winterlicious, and loved the place for its warm decor (fireplace especially) and yummy food. The winterlicious menu desserts were not the best for me, because I can't eat heavy cream in creme brulee or cold ice cream. By adding 2.50, I switched my dessert to apple crisp, which is delicious. Just the right amount of tart and sweet.   The coconut shrimp for appetizer is my favourite out of the meal. Nothing beats deep fried anything! The maple glazed salmon with market vegetable are very sweet. The regular menu looks great too. A lot of tables around us didn't come for winterlicious, and just came for the regular menu, which is what I will do next time!"}
{"text":"Came here once for brunch and the food was pretty awesome.  It's also known to be really child-friendly with a decent kids menu.  It was perfect for our group since we had around 10 in total and some kids with us.  The service was prompt and when the server forgot to punch in a soup, she had one packed up for her to-go and didn't charge us.  I had the french toast and it was rich but delicious with sweet and savoury.  Reason why it's 4/5 is the pricing.  Seems a bit high for the area."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place a few times.  The food is great and the staff are great.  One time I had a not so great experience, but they went above and beyond to correct it which really showed me they are a high class place and care about their customers.  Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times throughout the years.  the food is great from pastas to burgers.  I am only slightly dissapointed with the take out sizes, appears to be half the amount of the dine in sizes.  The food only fills half the take out containers.  Love their calamari they cooked it perfectly crispy outside and tender inside.  They have raised their price over the years but i guess thats expected with rising costs.  I still enjoy the deck at the back occassionally, makes you feel like you are not in the city with all the trees and greenery."}
{"text":"I have just come home from Lunch at Jawny Bakers. I have been there multiple times, thinking every time, that it could not have been as bad as I'm remembering it.   Today I had a burger and coffee. My boyfriend had an Olga's omelette ( sun dried tomatos, mushrooms, feta cheese and spinach). On paper the food sounds good enough to justify the price. The restaurant has curries, goat cheese, spices and other quality ingredients but quality ingredients is only half of what makes good food good.   My burger was made with quality ground beef but was not seasoned in anyway. Nobody bothered to put even a pinch of salt into the meat before overcooking the shit out of it. The \"cheddar and mozzarella cheese blend\" had no flavour whatsoever and the bun was dry.   My boyfriend ate a small portion of his omelette (I've never seen him not finish a meal). Despite it's checklist of delicious ingredients he called it \"dry and tasteless.\" .   Both of us did like the fries. And were satisfied with the coffee which was like any diner coffee except at twice the cost.   Our bill was 36 dollars before tip by the time we were done. It was hard to dish out for such a mediocre experience.   Also be prepared to be served by several different servers per visit, and while my boyfriend, my Dad and I have all had a hard time putting our finger on it, all of us have agreed the waiters consistently give off an overwhelming feeling of insincerity. Probably part of their training to act a certain way towards customers.  Decor is fine, though the place's acoustics make it so that you can often hear everyone in the restaurant's voice over your own.   Anyway , don't go there. For half the price, go to a cheap diner with less fancy ingredients, made flavourful by a chef that understands how to fry an egg."}
{"text":"Love this place, been coming here for years! Great food! Love their Bombay Chicken Curry!"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious food here! Had the calamari and cheese sticks for appetizers and the west coast burger. The calamari was perfect, lightly battered and fried, and it tastes really good with the sauce. Cheese sticks were gooey and stringy on the inside and crispy on the outside, well done! My burger was tasty, albeit a bit messy because it fell apart as it was stuffed with many ingredients. The fries that came with it were crispy and salty, very good without any condiments. The burger and fries were pretty filling together, for $17. Overall a great place to have a meal for special occasions."}
{"text":"The menu is regular bar food with an extra gourmet flair. Sandwiches, burgers, salads, steak, pastas and even lobster. The wine and beer selection is great. The import beer list boasts the classics plus some new favourites like Chimay.  I had the Chicken Tandoori sandwich which was served in a Greek pita with mango salsa, tzatziki, and crispy onion ($16.85). The the cut of chicken was generous in size and it was quite tasty.  The main attraction is their patio. Possibly one of the best patios I have seen in the city. It sits high above the Don Valley Ravine, with the tall trees and their thick foliage giving the illusion of being in an exotic rainforest. The modest patio tables are set far apart for more privacy. It is a perfect spot for a romantic dinner for two.The lanterns add a nice cottage feel to the whole experience.    It's also worth mentioning that they are very kid friendly and offer a wide variety of gluten-free options."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks like a typical franchise restaurant.  The selection just doesn't do it for me and the prices really turn me off.  I can go to a Kelsey's, Casey's or Firkin for better selection and prices.  If you are in the area and are hungry, I suppose it will do.  I would recommend going a little further east to Eglinton Square where there are more restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Jawny Bakers Restaurant is a decent neighbourhood pub.  The deco is cozy and simple. Love the fireplace and all these TVs. Unsecured Wifi makes me happy while eating my lunch here!  There is a lunch combo special till 3 pm from $11 or so. Chilli with a side Caesar ($12) I found it on the pricier side for what I got. The chili is a little too salty for my taste. I did enjoy the warm bread with the whipped butter!  A relatively good selection of beer on tap includes Mill Street. I almost want to order a pint with my lunch.....  Free parking and a nice patio overlooking the ravine....  I would be back for a drink during patio season."}
{"text":"Ordered the Jawny's burger. Not what I thought it would be. The lettuce was chewy, probably GMO. They had sweet pickles on it which was ok but I do prefer the sour ones. There wasn't much taste to the burger itself, very bland.   The staff was nice but the service was slow. Didn't offer me water nor remembered I wanted more sauce with my burger. But friendly none the less."}
