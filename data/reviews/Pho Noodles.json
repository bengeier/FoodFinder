{"text":"What a gem! Small restaurant but very charming. Service was excellent. Our waitress was kind and food came out quickly. Pho was delicious. Vegetables were fresh, broth was tasty, and rice noodles were delicious. I also ordered the egg rolls. I will definitely be coming back again.  Prices were great too."}
{"text":"Best Pho broth I've tasted in a long time! My dinner companion ordered Pho with tripe and tendon. While my Bun was very good, I was jealous of her choice the rest of the night. The portions are massive, the prices are awesome, and I'll totally be back soon to get a bowl of that rich layered broth for myself! This place is at least on par with Da Vang and Pho Than. What a great little mom and pop joint! Time and money well spent, people!"}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie pho and the veggie bahn mi sandwich (delivered by postmates). The sandwich was on awesome crispy and chewy bread, the tofu was cooked perfectly, and the toppings were awesome with enough sauce so that it was not dry. The soup was incredibly flavorful, I could taste all the spices, particularly star anise. The soup came with a huge takeout box filled with tons of glass noodles, lime, veggies, and a small amount of the two pho sauces. It is a ton of food. Tastes so, so good. Love that they open at 9am. I'll definitely order from here again, SOON."}
{"text":"Love the pho broth here.  Very fragrant and profile than local competition (pho Thanh, da Vang). The staff here is super sweet and I like the change in space (smaller and cozier vs Pho Thanh's ever growing space)"}
{"text":"I'm so excited to have a noodle place open up within walking distance of my apartment. I've only had take-out so far but the restaurant is clean, the service is super friendly, and the prices are very reasonable.  The broth they make for the pho is so delicious and flavorful, I sip it on its own when no one is looking. The beef is very tender and soft, and the noodles are perfect. I've also tried their avocado smoothie and while it could have been blended better (had a couple chunks stick in my straw) it had great flavor and was not too sweet.  My roommate and I love walking to local restaurants and this is definitely one we will be coming back to."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service, so friendly, and really tasty good quality food! The people are so kind and made our first visit a great one. I love that it is a family owned business! Food was great!"}
{"text":"Lol ordered a drink didn't have it.......so we got Thai ice tea.....ordered banh mi they didn't have it lol but they had no issue charging us for drinks after having literally nothing we ordered and they waited forever after the drinks to let us know they didn't have anything we ordered. And then they awkwardly try to sell us on other items that we didn't ask for lol we really wanted to love this place. Lol kind of tacky"}
{"text":"The food there is still great, but their service is horrible. Went there tonight to get food and waited 10 minutes to get a menu. Asked for water four times and never got it. Asked for them to clean the table and it never happened. This all would have been fine if the people next to us who had come in ten minutes after us had not already gotten food. Before we got water. We left out of frustration."}
{"text":"BBQ Pulled Pork Sando is legit, and $4. Get two. I am not much of a noodle lover but my special lady friend said the Pho is as good as she has had. Laid back, seems family run. Will be back for further research."}
{"text":"First visit at Pho Noodles and it was great food. It is self seating and the staff are very attentive to your dining experience. Ever since I lived in the Pacific NW, I have always been looking for a great Pho and when I find one, I gotta tell the world.  If you are looking fo authentic Pho, this is the place. The portions are perfect and the prices are fair. I ordered the Beef, shrimp and cluck pho and enjoyed all the flavors except for the chicken. The chicken was a little chalky but, still going to give it 5 stars. I will be back pho sho!!!"}
{"text":"Great Pho.  Good Bahn Mi.  I would eat here every day if I ate out that much!  I just wish they had hot Vietnamese coffee on the menu and then this place would be perfect."}
{"text":"Quick, efficient service and generous portions with  reasonable prices. I drove by this place and decided to give it a try because I was craving noodle soup. I ordered the chicken and shrimp pho to go and it was ready in 5 minutes. When I unpacked the broth and ingredients at home, I was impressed by the huge container of broth and the heaps of chicken. Although there were only 4 pieces shrimp, everything tasted fresh and delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a quick, tasty and affordable Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner on a cold night, initially wanting to get some Pho to go.  We arrived within 30 minutes of the restaurant closing (sorry), and didn't want to be a pain. Well, they were very friendly and accommodating. We ended up dining in, and getting appetizers and drinks, plus they offered to pack up our leftover soup to go.  Very happy this place is so close to home. Will definitely be going back for good food, service and prices!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Ordered the Pho beef combo and grilled pork spring rolls. Both was excellent! Service was great!"}
{"text":"First time here and overall it was a great experience. I was seated and my order was taken right away. Ordered #52 and a side of shrimp and pork spring rolls. Spring rolls were ok, pork tasted undercooked but the main entree (#52) was amazing! The entire mix of it all was delicious down to the sauce. Definitely would eat here again."}
{"text":"Long wait on a rainy day but the food was amazing. And affordable. Owner apologized for wait. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've been craving Pho fo two weeks and decided to try this place since Pho Thanh is closed for a friggin WHOLE month for Chinese New Year!!! Really glad I did, because Pho Noodles really hit the spot.  The staff seem nice and courteous and for a Wednesday, it was pretty packed at around 6pm.   Started off with a couple spring rolls which were delicious and not too greasy.  For my main meal I had the 22. Pho Tai Nam / Rice Noodles with Rare Steak, Well Diced Flank, Tendon, Tripe, Meatballs. Luckily there was some Sriracha and sliced jalapenos included, though I could have used more. The spicier the better.  The only thing preventing a 5 star review was the 58. Taro - Fresh Boba Slushy. The boba was still hard and it just didn't taste good. I'll stick with SNOW or Bosa for Boba drinks I guess."}
{"text":"I love the pho there and the bun Bo hue beef spicy noodles the place  is clean and the service  very good. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Clean, fast and nice server! I'm glad to have a pho place near my area had a shrimp beef and chicken pho and the portion was huge couldn't finish the whole thing flavor was great and prices where about average! Was served pretty fast so overall great experience and I will be back!"}
{"text":"There's only a small handful of authentic Vietnamese places that do Pho right...this place is one of them. The broth is the perfect balance of savory flavors and the portions are just right.   Ordered the Spring rolls too which was just as delicious. The prices are very reasonable and the woman there (probably the owner) is gracious.  Perfect location because it's next to Safeway, so you can get your grocery shopping and dinner done at the same time!"}
{"text":"My favorite Pho joint in Phoenix.  They even have a Keto Pho Thai with no noodles but broccoli and bok choy and other veggies.  So delicious and you won't miss the noodles.  Very friendly and accomadating.  Go check it out."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place! SSSOOO delish! Tastiest broth ever, service above and beyond. Clean restaurant. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple and easy- BEST PHO in The Central Phoenix area. Clean restaurant- friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I can't stop drinking the soup! This is one of the best pho restaurants I've tried in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The only things that would make Pho Noodles any better is the ability to order an ice cold Tsing Tao to go along with this delicious Pho. Tucked away in a crappy little strip center on the northeast corner of 7th Ave and Osborn, this spot has become THE vietnamese spot for all central Phoenix residents. With the underwhelming return of Rice Paper, which is not only 10x more expensive than Pho Noodles, but 10x worse (see my review) Pho Noodles uses the perfect sized noodles in their Pho, they have amazing fresh spring rolls, and is 100% legit. Not a word of english is spoken in this restaurant, which i love, it is always busy, and the prices are great. We ordered takeout the other night, 3 chicken pho, 4 spring rolls, 1 fried roll was about $35.....At rice paper it is $14 for 1 average bowl of pho....I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I go here at least twice a week for the pho. Service is great, food is amazing, and at a really good price. I can spend 11dollars and leave there with a full belly that lasts half the day. Staff is speedy with your food and drinks, always have a smile on their face, and remember your face the next time they see you. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm vietnamese so when i  crave vietnamese food, I'm looking for authentic food. This place is quite authentic.  Food was great.  Prices were similar to other places but the restaurant was much nicer and cleaner.  Service was excellent which is not normal at other vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"Yay! Finally a great, authentic pho restaurant that's clean, friendly, and extremely affordable!   First of all, although there are a myriad of Vietnamese options in the Phoenix area, it's refreshing to find a new restaurant that has a friendly, warm, welcoming staff as well as a nice, clean interior. A lot of the pho \"go-tos\" around the downtown area are in old, shabby buildings (sometimes with no air conditioning) and are sometimes staffed by waiters who seem impatient or unfriendly. Not here! We felt welcomed and comfortable the whole time, which makes Pho Noodles a diamond in the rough.  As for the food--wow! It's some of the best pho I've tried in the valley (and I've had a lot)! Authentic pho, with a deep, hearty, extremely flavorful broth, good portions of tender meat, and springy, tasty noodles: it was just right! All of their ingredients seem fresh and care is put into their food. I absolutely recommend, and this will be one of my regular spots to get pho now! Can't wait to try their other Vietnamese dishes, too!  (My only slight complaint is that the Vietnamese iced coffee tasted a little too sweet and syrupy, but that could just be preference!) Kudos to you, Pho Noodles!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian pho here is the perfect vehicle for the noodles and whathaveyou! Would recommend to people who like eating at good restaurants."}
{"text":"Oh yes this is awesome food and it's proven by the all the people that go there during dinner and the weekends. The Pho bowls and Thai tea are really good and l am getting hungry just typing this."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It's a great addition to the neighborhood. Food was fresh and staff were very friendly. My only recommendation would be to consider scaling back the menu, or maybe highlight 10-12 of the most popular dishes for customers not familiar with Pho - the current menu is really overwhelming."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food at super reasonable price with great service. New fave. Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Was in town visiting from Cali and craving Pho. A local recommended this place and I went for it.  I had to come back two times. The first, I requested a table for one 30 minutes before closing and the gentleman said they rather not serve me anymore since they were closing soon.  He wasn't rude or anything but his response took me by surprise. The place wasn't busy at all.   I came back the next day since I was craving but got to-go. The trip didn't take long but when I was back the broth was cold.  There wasn't any jalapeño as I've seen in their pictures. They hadn't included the spicy sauce as well.   The broth was good which is typically what most Pho places miss, but just the lack of service is the reason for the 3 stars. I wish I wouldn't have had to take two trips just to satisfy my craving."}
{"text":"A whole section of vegetarian options! The rice noodle soup with tofu and vegetables was a hit! I'll be going back for this dish soon!"}
{"text":"So tasty! This was my first time here. My regular Pho joint is closed on Tuesdays so my friend & I decided to give this a try. I thought it was delicious, she was not as impressed. The broth was very flavorful on its own, which I loved! The noodles were classic & there was a lot of them! We also got an order of the Vietnamese Egg Rolls which were good. The restaurant is small but very clean & more modern looking than a lot of local noodle places. I would definitely come back! In fact, I'm thinking it would make for a great weeknight dinner to go!"}
{"text":"Spring rolls are some of the best I've had, and Pho is really good, but some of the other stuff is a little uneven.  I ordered grilled pork patties, and what I got looked a lot like Spam (but oddly enough, not really bad)  ... service is often haphazard and slow, and while everyone is very friendly and polite, English skills vary by family member, so it's key to speak clearly to make sure you are being understood."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this is some of the most delicious pho I think I've had. Got the plain Jane pho ga and it was so good. The portion is huuuge for the size too! 8$ for a massive bowl! Everything is well priced and it's a very clean restaurant. I will be returning!!!"}
{"text":"This was a hidden gem right by my office! I had no idea it was there. Honestly, the pho is great. But what is even better was how nice everyone was. The door was held open for me. A nice man greeted me when I walked inside and the cashier was very nice as well. I will go here much more often now that It's just around the corner!"}
{"text":"The weather, the family , the friends makes this cozy place a great and perfect combination for PHO. The tasteful and delicious pho soups and Bbq pork sandwich satisfying. I look forward to returning to what is now one of my favorite places !!! Happy New Year!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. I went once for lunch and once for dinner. The beef on the Vietnamese sandwich had the consistency of rubber bands. The spring rolls are exceptional. The lemongrass chicken was bland, and a beef/noodle/vegetable dish was mostly flavorless noodles. Service is friendly and efficient. The lighting is florescent and harsh, and the place can feel loud and cramped when it's busy."}
{"text":"Food is excellent & prices are reasonable. Service is friendly & fast. I see why they are so popular. Good vegetarian options too!"}
{"text":"Pho Noodles is the first place I've found in Arizona who has food that reminds me of home, Little Saigon in Southern California. Their soup is spot on and the brooth is not too salty, but its chalk full of flavor. If you are in the mood for Vietnamese and are in the area, Pho Noodles is delicious and affordable. A big bowl of soup is $7! You can't even get a McDonald's meal with 7 bucks any more. Highly recommend you stopping by!!"}
{"text":"the absolute best vegan pho anywhere.  seriously - and the owner is extremely nice.  stellar service, chill atmosphere.   I've found my spot!"}
{"text":"My family frequented here for months and when they got our order wrong last night they wouldn't budge. We ordered 2 pho with just veggies and we received 2 cold orders with a ton of tofu. (All orders are usually hot-- been coming here for months.) When I pointed this out I was blamed for the mistake (even though we've been successfully ordering take out from here for months) and was basically yelled at about all their business expenses, and accused of calling the boy who worked there a liar. I'm just a friendly lady who's been coming here ordering almost weekly, holding a baby- seriously? If she'd have just remade the order - even for half price - we would keep coming almost weekly like we have been. I'm all about finding a happy, fair option. But now I don't see myself returning. That was wild."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices!!! Very nice employee team but could use a bit more help during peak hours."}
{"text":"I love this place.  So far everything I've tried has been delicious. So glad to have them in the neighborhood.  If I had to say something besides praise all I would add is that I wish they had a non pork crispy egg roll but that's just based on my personal dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho spots - always friendly and fast service, amazing pho (my favorites are the pho tai chin [#23] or pho Tom, ga, tai [#29]) and the shrimp and pork spring rolls [#2] are always a must"}
{"text":"If you're looking for that a Pho fix in your life, this place can cure it. It's definitely above average, but not the best I've had, but better than most. It's a popping place for lunch but service is still quick. Appetizers came out quickly followed shortly after by a big bowl of hot Pho. Price is on par with most place and generous portion sized bowls."}
{"text":"Just had an awesome early lunch of pho with rare beef and a banh mi. The pho had an incredible broth with deep rich flavors.  The banh mi was on crunchy bread as it should be, with grilled pork. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"as everyone said before... \"SO EXCITED FOR A PHO PLACE SO CLOSE TO MY HOUSE!\"  we came in and had the rolls which were deep fried and tasty.  the filling was delicious and packed full of flavor.   i ordered the pho bowl with meatballs and flank. the bowl came out piping hot and the aromatics filled my senses. the first initial taste (without adding any condiments) was excellent! the broth was exactly what i wanted, the perfect comfort pho flavor of broth.   highly recommended for the price and the flavor.   my only real criticism would be the service.  they were extremely friendly however not very attentive with checking up on the table and dropping our check. i'm sure those kinks will be ironed out as they get more time under their belt.   we will be definitely back for more bowls."}
{"text":"I was a fan of this place until yesterday. My friend and I both got bad diarrhea right after eating this place.. it's unfortunate that I lost one of my go to place."}
{"text":"** More like a 3.5 **   I'm not from the area so my standards for pho/viet food are probably higher. It's not bad for the area, but to me it's a 3.5 flat.   Broth was on the saltier side - indicating MSG and not enough time cooking the actual broth. It's probably the way they cater to all the customers.. this place was popping at 4pm and plenty walked in for to-go orders. We also ordered the grilled pork rice.. more like steak version, with bone and not traditional grilled pork plate I'm used to.   This place is decent but I'd explore the other pho places too."}
{"text":"Pho Noodles has become my latest addiction. They are quick, friendly, affordable, and scrumptious. What else does one need? I regularly get #22 or #25 because I LOVE tripe. Call me crazy, but it's a texture thing. Unlike similar Vietnamese restaurants in the area, they don't skimp on the ingredients that make pho fun to eat. They also have mean vegetarian pho options and they load in the bok choy. Plenty of parking available as well, which is just the icing on the cake. 5 stars from me!!"}
{"text":"Best Pho!   Pho here is delicious and I love the spring rolls! The restaurant is small and clean and the people are always nice!  We go here regularly and will keep going back for more!!"}
{"text":"Friendly place with amazing food!  I will definitely go back!! Don't debate on this place, just go.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho in town. The service is always awesome as well. Everything tastes incredibly fresh."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC!!!!! It was super busy and yet the food came out so fast!!!!! Our waiter was so friendly. I wish I had caught his name to compliment him directly but I missed it. I have had a lot of Pho in the valley and a lot of it is disappointing. I can say with full vigor that this is some of the best Pho in Arizona!  Their hot tea is also lovely. They use full, loose leaf tea leaves. Most places will give you a cheap bag, but this was beautiful! For 2 big bowls of Pho (with a lot of meat), a spring roll appetizer, and 2 drinks came out to around $22! If you like Pho, go here!!!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this little gem. The pho is tasty and affordable. Always good service. I do not recommend the tea because it tasted like unfiltered water."}
{"text":"Im pretty impressed with this little place. There are many places where you can get two entrees and two appetizers for under $20. Now, we did receive a 10% discount but that's only a few bucks in savings (appreciative of the discount though).   The shrimp spring rolls were light and delicious. I don't like peanut sauce so I dipped them in tamari and ponzu.  The egg rolls were very good! I'm not a big egg roll because their usually greasy and heavy, but these are light and full of flavor.   My husband and I both ordered the #24 which is Pho with steak. The broth is bold and has a refreshing ginger taste. The steak is good, but was under seasoned. With the cilantro, Thai basil, scallions, chili paste and broth, the lack of flavoring in the steak is most certainly not a deal breaker.   Right now, they are offering 10% of the entire bill.   If you haven't tried this place and are looking for a yummy, inexpensive meal check this place out and support a local business."}
{"text":"Bummer having to write this review, but we feel it's necessary. We are pho-fanatics & eat it everywhere we travel. We're by no means pho-snobs, though, and appreciate different variations. This pho was boring, there wasn't much meat, and the tendon (my favorite cut in most bowls) was rock hard & tasteless. The bean sprouts were questionably fresh. The shrimp/pork spring rolls came out & the stench of the not-too-fresh shrimp was strong enough to smell from the other side of the table. Lastly, the hot tea came out, was lukewarm, and the water they used was not clean tasting. Now, the staff was friendly, and the service was okay, so we hate to slam the place. Just wouldn't recommend this restaurant at all, and wish the Yelp reviews had swayed us to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Their pork sausage spring rolls (Nem Nuong Cuon) have crunchy wonton in them. Which I love! It's hard to find that in the valley. Very common thing to do when ordering at Vietnamese restaurants in the OC (Vietnamese Culinary Mecca). So it was a pleasant surprise when I took my first bite.  Even though I'm Vietnamese, I'm not a big fan of pho. I was hoping they would have a large menu outside of Com (broken rice), Banh Mi, and noodle soups outside of Pho, like Bun Bo Hue, Bun Rieu, or Mi. No biggie because their broth was delicious and they are a new restaurant. I had talked to one of the employees about the menu expansion. They seek to do so in the future, so I'm excited.  I would definitely come back here again with my Vietnamese folks for lunch or with friends when seeking a hangover remedy.. Haha. It's nice that they are open on Tuesday's because Pho Thanh and Da Vang would be closed. For whatever reason I crave Vietnamese food when they're not open.  Thanks Pho Noodles!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We didn't realize the hours, so we ordered take out. The entire restaurant was full even after closing time. They seemed a little short staffed but the servers ran around with urgency. When we asked for how long the wait the man said, Plan on it taking awhile. I wasn't too impressed with that response but we weren't in any hurry. I understand it's easy to get flustered under pressure.  We ordered the seafood pho and shrimp egg rolls and it was amazing! Great flavor, great proportions. Definitely will be back to enjoy a sit down dinner there."}
{"text":"Pho Noodles is a welcome addition to the midtown/Melrose area. Although the area does not have a shortage of other Asian restaurants, people in the area usually had to go farther into the west side or to north Phoenix to get good Vietnamese food. This restaurant is cozy, very clean, and conveniently located in the commercial complex at the northeast corner of 7th Avenue and Osborn. The staff is friendly and the food is inexpensive and really good. The other reviewers have already discussed how good their pho is, so let me just mention that I love their crispy banh xeo, which is a must-try for people who want something a bit different from the usual noodle or rice dishes. And their Vietnamese rolls are really good, especially the ones with tofu and vegetables - the ingredients are really fresh and the rice-paper wrapper is tender and not rubbery, unlike in some Vietnamese eateries."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!  Clean, friendly, priced right, large portions, and lightning fast.  I work just down the road and have 30 minutes for lunch, I was in and out and back to work before time expired.  I love Vietnamese food and have visited many locations, this is one I will always go back to.  Would I recommend Pho Noodles, yes, to everyone I know!  Go here, you won't be disappointed.  Tip......go early, by the time I departed every chair had a butt."}
{"text":"Fair not great. Ordered the Banh Mi sandwich with pork but it had processed sliced meat on it similar to subway. No flavor. The Saigon pancake was deep fried and covered in grease. Greasy and no Flavor The Pho was ok. Will not return. Disappointed  Wish we could recommend"}
{"text":"I was never a fan of pho, being a ramen addict myself. However, Pho Noodles is our go to place  when my boyfriend is having a pho craving which is pretty frequently. I love that it's so affordable. I don't ever guilty about eating out when I eat here. The service is always great and their pho is delicious. The broth is tasty and and flavorful, the noodles are cooked perfectly and the meat is tender. I have yet to try the other items in their menu like the sandwiches and the rice dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho, noodles were perfectly cooked and broth was tasty. Small place, but fast service."}
{"text":"This is an older review that happened weeks ago and forgot to upload. Called in an order and was told 15-20 min which is the normal wait time. I go there 20 minutes later and had to wait more. The total wait time for the food was over an hour.  No explanation or apologies. Well one apology after I received my food. This isn't the first time their service was less to be desired. They just need more waiters/waitresses. I haven't been back since. I'd rather drive a little further to get better service."}
{"text":"*Update 9/3/17* I came back after the owner told me they worked out a few 'kinks' with the staff- and I'm leaving happy! They have a new server, Armando- who is great and the food is on par to match. They have actually updated the menu, and now have pork meatball fresh rolls with the crunchy piece in the middle, and I'm loving the Saigon crepe (which isn't a new addition but tasted extra good today!! Try out this place if you like good prices and Vietnamese food     So I've been here 5+ times and would rate them 3.5 stars. The pho is good but not the best, large portions and inexpensive- as pho should be! Love the spring rolls here and you get 2 for under $3. Mainly, my husband and I come here because you get your food really fast and it is inexpensive! The egg rolls are small but cooked fresh and also inexpensive. The sandwiches are $4 and although more bread than meat, the bread is fresh baked and very tasty. My pet peeve is the service here. All the younger Vietnamese(?) staff are very friendly and attentive, but there is one taller, older non-Asian gentleman that works there, and whenever he is working you can just tell everyone else working there feels uncomfortable. He is rude to guests and has consistently got my or husbands, or other patron's order wrong and doesn't admit his wrong, apologize or adjust the bill. When he is working, I will no longer go back in there. His lack of customer service and rude attitude ruins the dtphx neighborhood pho place!!"}
{"text":"Eaten here about 5-6 times and each time has been absolutely delicious. My wife is a vegetarian and loves their veggie pho. The service is adequate and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Super clean, super fast and super delicious! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Avoid this place.  The food was good, but it was the worst service I have had in the last twenty years.  The food took 40 minutes to come out, and he brought out only one plate at a time.  The waiter completely forgot one of the orders even after we repeatedly asked about it.  He also forgot one of the drinks.  At the end he tried to overcharge me on the check by more than ten dollars."}
{"text":"Decided to re-rate this restaurant after not coming here for awhile. It's probably been about 6 or more months since my boyfriend and I ate here. But they have definitely improved on their services. This was the main issue we stopped coming. Before we waited about 30 minutes to even order our food and another hour to get our food. I am not sure what they changed to be able to get their fast service back. Overall, the food is delicious, but they could provide more of the garnishes. I just asked for more. Great place and I'm glad it has improved!"}
{"text":"Good tasty flavorful pho broth!  Spring rolls are tasty too  definitely coming back! Nice and clean."}
{"text":"Like the inside and atmosphere much more than pho thanh on camelback. The pho noodle soup I tried had excellent broth and flavor. The amount of pho noodle could have been a little heavier but otherwise I have no complaints on their pho. My wife and I tried their banh mi though, and it was sorely lacking. Just below par. If you stick to the namesake dish, you're in the clear!"}
{"text":"Pho Noodles was the second place I  tried  in Phoenix  during  our visit.. Our first was Pho Thanh.. I had the shrimp  pho and took a Bahn Mi to go.. Pho was just ok and the sandwich  went in the garbage. Very dry and tasteless.. Really not  crazy about either  place, so will probably look  elsewhere next time we visit my  son."}
{"text":"Great addition to the 7th avenue neighborhood.  The Two of us ate - spring rolls and two dinners - cost was 20 bucks with tip and the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Pho Noodles shortly after it opened and it has been my go-to Vietnamese restaurant locally. I usually get the shrimp pho - the broth is delicious and the shrimp are not overcooked. Friends and family have tried a variety of other menu items and there hasn't been a single complaint. I've heard raves about the eggrolls and the bun xiao . I've also ordered the boba - they can make any smoothie dairy-free, for those of us who are lactose-intolerant :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the Pho Chay (vegan with tofu, rice noodles and veges). Absolutely delicious!! Everything tasted fresh and the service was perfect!  Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"First time at Pho Noodles the other day. Good thing we got there early for lunch because by the time noon hit, the tables were full of people. This is a smaller place with a handful of 2-4 person tables. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was squeaky clean.  We ordered quickly, food also was delivered quickly, and the portions are huge! On that note, prices are very reasonable but everything was extremely tasty especially the beef!  Enjoyed the Shrimp Spring Roll and #29 Rice Noodles with Chicken, Shrimp and beef.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Pho Noodles.  I just landed in Phoenix and what better way to start my busy day is to find a great Vietnamese restaurant.  I got there around 10am and it was nice that they open so early.  The place had about 10 tables and it was fairly clean.  I ordered the following:  Beef, tripe and tendon pho ($7): awesome!!! the savory soup was tasty (not overpowering of star anise) with lots of meat and noodle.    Grilled porkball spring roll ($3.25): it came with two pieces filled with crispy egg roll skin, lettuce, pickled carrots, rice noodles and sliced porkball.    I will definitely keep this place bookmarked on my profile."}
{"text":"Favorite Vietnamese place in the PHX area. You can't go wrong with any of the menu items...their spring rolls are particularly tempting. Inexpensive and the service is always quick and friendly. This place has become a staple in the usual weekly take out spots I hit."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, good veggie options. Ordered the Veggie Pho, love that it had baby bok choy and broccoli. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Place is so freaking good! Reminds me of going to places in cali they even have bahn mi sandwiches mmmm"}
{"text":"First they get a lot of credit for being so close to my home. But the food speaks for itself I've been eating pho for 10 years and this place is as good as all the rest. Clean area friendly staff felt like I was a regular after the first time. They also serve bahn mi , I have not tried theirs yet but that is wonderful that they have both options."}
{"text":"Thai tea not to sweet, which usually they make very sweet, i love it. The service is on it l, I was very nicely greeted. Very clean environment perfect hole in the wall... i ordered to go and they put it together"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating this food im on a mission to try new foods from around the world that i wont be able to try in there native country i enjoyed it but cant be a judge if it was good or not till i try it again may be from another restaurant . Thank for the water and courteous service and the help with your menu."}
{"text":"We came for pho soup, very happy we did, greeted by a friendly host. The place is very clean, the food excellent, the soup I order had 6 big shrimps, was very flavorful and only $6.95."}
{"text":"Great broth in the pho! Fresh food! Simple family owned and run place. They have a constant stream of patriotism no which is awesome!"}
{"text":"First time we tried the Pho noodles here. I got take out. Service was nice, while ordering and while I was waiting, but I got home and there was hardly any meat in the Pho. Most places we go have lots of meat. We order #22 .The soup was very good, but very disappointed at the little amount of meats that were provided. Not sure if we will go back."}
{"text":"Only good thing about this place is the broth, and that wasn't even that good.... the meatballs were full of cartilage, the chicken was tough and dry! And they only give you two egg rolls in one ord"}
{"text":"I want to go back!!! It was soooo good the vegetarian pho omg the vegetarian pho is a must!"}
{"text":"The food here is good, but the service is horrendous.  I have given this place chance after chance, but they continue to be so lackluster in their customer service that it is almost laughable. Sitting for over ten minutes when you first come in without even being acknowledged is simply unacceptable."}
{"text":"The workers in the back cooking. Be a good idea to start wearing hair nets. Found a long black hair in my food in my noodles .  Last time I order Pho soup.  Another black hair. That was my experience."}
{"text":"Not the best pho.  Not the worst.  It's decent.  I ordered pho tai gan sach bo vien (pho with rare beef, tendon, tripe, beef meatballs).  They got the order wrong and added in beef brisket too.  I asked for glass of water, no ice.  Same lady I gave the order to brought it out with a glass totally filled with ice.  They do give you really small portions of meat in the pho so the meat is all gone with a lot of noodle left.  When I ordered an extra beef meatballs (bo vien) on the side, the kitchen had forgotten to make the order and I did not get it until after I finished my pho, after I reminded them.  Also it was one beef meatball sliced into 4 pieces and they charged me $2 for it.  lol.  Talk about being overcharged here for small portions of meat.  Other than that, the quality of the meat in the pho was good.  The staff here consistently have problems getting the order right even though they are nice.  Be warned."}
{"text":"One of the BEST places to get pho!!! The owner is so nice and amazing, she actually cooks the pho herself everyday! My boyfriend and I go at least once a week! When it's busy it's definitely worth the wait    #25 is my boyfriends favorite XL!"}
{"text":"Easily the best Pho in Phoenix and my favorite place to eat pho. Their broth has always been on point, delicious and flavorful. Get the pho with everything on it and order their spring rolls! Also the staff is very kind."}
{"text":"Updating my old review. The food is good and I actually think their Thai tea is one of the best I've tried in the area, but never I repeat NEVER do take out. They will tell you over the phone that your order will be ready in 10-15 minutes you will get there and you will have to wait an additional 20-30 minutes. One time I had to wait 1 hour for my take out order! The employees just kept telling me \"5 more minutes is coming out\" I was furious and even told them to cancel it after I saw they kept serving people who came after me. At the end, they figured out they lost my order ticket! Did they give me a discount or apology ? No, I wish. Today I order take out again (you think I would of learn my lesson) I get there at the time it should of been ready. I pay and then they say that my iced tai tea is not ready and they make me wait 30 minutes for the tea!!!! Can you believe it, the service is ridiculously outrageous And unorganized. The food is good but today they have lost my business and I'll never recommend this place to anyone. I gave them several chances thinking it was a one time hiccup but noooo they just suck at service."}
{"text":"Not the best pho I've ever had, but the best I've had in the Valley. This is our go-to spot when we want Vietnamese. Some nights it is better than others, but it's always good.  I'm also a big fan of the broken rice with pork chop. The rice is perfectly cooked, the pork chop is generous, tender and well seasoned and the veggies are always fresh.  The bahn xeo is good, but always takes a while to make. Even if you order as an appetizer, it comes out after the pho.  One star gets knocked off for the service - it's always haphazard. I've never seen the same wait staff more than once and the service is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"My go to for authentic delicious Pho. I normally order Pha Ga. Other restaurants Pho Ga has abnormally dry chicken, but not Pho Noodles. Their chicken is tender and moist, and their broth is insanely delicious. Their staff is very friendly, accommodating, immensely quick and the restaurant itself is very clean. I only have one complaint; I wish they would have some music playing. It doesn't have to be loud, but I think it would create a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pho'ntastic! My sister stalked this place until they finally opened their doors and I'm so glad she did. The prices are very reasonable, if not a little cheaper than their local competitors and the place is bright, clean, and inviting. This little family run spot has some of the best pho broth I've had. The spices come through without being overpowering and of course all the add-ins are there for you to make it just the way you like. They have a very nice selection of other food options as well, including fried or soft noodle bowls, appetizers, and Vietnamese, Thai, and Boba drinks. Portion sizes are really BIG, so plan on taking home leftovers or sharing unless you don't mind leaving behind a lot of goodness.  The service is amazingly fast and friendly. They are attentive without hovering which is always a hard balance to strike. I highly recommend this place if you are in the neighborhood and they offer take-out if you would rather eat at home.  I will adjust stars after a few more visits but this place is on its way to a Pho'nomenal five stars if they keep this up!!"}
{"text":"I thought it was alright. Da Vang is still my number one choice for Pho. I ordered Pho Tai and the broth is off to me somehow. The springroll was loaded with old cabbage and it threw me off. The peanut sauce was weird too. Maybe I was having a bad day.  However the service is nice and professional-not necessary for a Pho place in my opinion. I like to be in and out quick like at Pho Thanh and Da Vang.  The portion is big which justify the price.  I do have a critique on the atmosphere and the lightning. When i was there it was sad. Maybe I was alone and it had been raining that day and I was lonely. Play some music and open the window cause I can hear all the chatter around me.  I will be back another time to give it another swing.   BTW water should comes with the menu every time. Bam bam bam. I like Da Vang and Pho Thanh cause they go this rather going."}
{"text":"This was the first time I visited Pho Noodles, and it will probably be the last. This review is based more on the customer service than the quality of the food. Tonight, not only were we served with Pho Noodles, we were witnesses to disorderly conduct that took place in the kitchen. This is a small restaurant, so when a disturbance occurs in the kitchen, you can hear all of its glory. An older woman was screaming at an older man in the kitchen. We also heard several thuds coming from the kitchen. A concerned customer opened the swinging door to stop the disturbance to see a man trapped against a wall being screamed at by an angry woman who appeared to be the owner. The customer who had two small children with him asked the screaming woman to stop her screaming. This angered the woman, and she began approaching the customer as if she was going to assault him. The customer threatened to call the police, and the poor server at the counter begged him not to call the police. It was the most awkward restaurant experience I have ever encountered. I'm not sure what the argument entailed between the man and the woman in the kitchen, but it was certainly not the time or place for the argument to occur in front of at least 15 seated customers."}
{"text":"Clean. We were welcomed and sat. Ordered got our food quick.  Egg rolls with pork are really good but small for the price.  Chicken soup and beef pho was extremely flavorful.  We are happy we tried this place. We will come again."}
{"text":"As a big fanatic of pho I have tried virtually all the local haunts and while some miss the mark Pho Noodles makes a decent bowl of soup!  Generally, the soup here is consistent, with a flavor profile that leans toward a heavier anise (?? Perhaps a bit heavier on the five spice?? Cannot pinpoint the exact flavor!) which is, to me, their uniqueness. I like their Thai Tea and Boba drink offerings as well. Looking forward to trying more of their menu. NOTE: I am compelled to offer some knowledge to those who claim to enjoy Pho, but appear to have no idea how it is made! I see a number of \"low star\" reviews by those who have ordered Pho to go and are confused and put off by the meat being \"raw\".  I urge you to search for an authentic Pho recipe! You will be surprised to discover virtually all of the soup is prepared with raw beef, placed in a bowl with cold noodles and the veggies.  The hot broth is then poured in the bowl heating the veggies and noodles and poaching or \"cooking\" the beef right in the bowl! (Please adjust all unfair reviews!! ;o) Thanks for listening!"}
{"text":"this place is not very good.  first off the service is slow and unresponsive.  i dont want to have to adk for something multiple times.  second the pho broth is overloaded with cinnamon.  if you want pho done right in this area go to pho thanh."}
{"text":"We found this place from Yelp. Excellent food. Nice services. Great price! We are very happy!"}
{"text":"Charming little strip mall restaurant. Young staff, attentive service.  Pho was good. The broth was pleasingly sweeter and a bit more spiced than the local competitors. Spring rolls were good.   Nothing glaring, but two, errr make that three main exceptions to (what I'd guess and have heard are relatives) the competition.  1.) no garlic chili paste (my ultimate favorite condiment). Yes they have sambal oelek. They have Sriracha. But not the dried chili flakes and chopped roasted garlic in oil. The dark, savory, spicy and sweet paste that makes my meal.  2.) compared to their local competition, the prices are higher. I won't speculate but there are numerous likely reasons for this.  3.) every time I go pho, I pleasantly have nearly half my bowl for the next day. I noticed that here, versus the traditional competition that typically after refrigeration, there is a noticeable coagulation of the broth. Which means, high quality bone broth...the basis in pho. Quite unfortunately that was not the case here which leads me to believe that more sugar and spice does not equal the pho is nice...  I'd return, but it's not my first or even second choice."}
{"text":"Visited Pho Noodles for lunch with a coworker recently. Our first time here. Coworker got the bun cha gio thit nuong which she liked.  Being viet I always try the pho to see if the restaurant is good or not. The pho was ok. A bit salty.  Not the best pho I've ever had but not the worse either.  There's some good pho on 19th and Missouri at Da Vang if you want to drive a little further and cheaper too. We also had the tofu spring rolls which were good. I would say this place is decent. Maybe go back and try something else.   Oh...we ordered the condensed ice coffee and dang, so small. Would have been good if it came in bigger container.  Anyways, service was quick and staff friendly."}
{"text":"If you like authentic Pho  I highly recommend this place. It is comparable to Davang, however I do think the broth and quality of food is slightly better"}
{"text":"The food was good and tasty. The order took a little longer than anticipated but it was the day before Thanksgiving and I am sure everybody was out eating instead of cooking."}
{"text":"I come here a couple times a week.  I always order the #6 Eggrolls and the #31 chicken pho.  Great customer service and very fast!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Pho Noodles because it came up in a Yelp recommendation. I skimmed through the photos and the Pork Banh Mi stood out. I wasn't very hungry so I ordered this and a side of spring rolls. It was very fresh and delicious. I look forward to trying other items."}
{"text":"Medium sized restaurant, not big, but not hole-in-the-wall small either. Atmosphere is great. Great place to dine out with friends and/or family.  My husband and I ordered the beef pho noodle soup and absolutely loved them. We eat pho pretty often, so we criticize to ourselves how well the recipe is from each restaurant we try and this one had it spot on. Reasonably priced as well, less than $10 per bowl, which is exceptional. Owner or manager is very nice and ready to answer any question you have. If we're ever in the area again, we'll definitely come back here."}
{"text":"The server is so nice here! The food is amazing. It's not the same as what I am use to from Texas, but it's really good. I had the Pho Ga which is number 31, pho with chicken. My boyfriend had the number 29. That had chicken, beef, and shrimp!"}
{"text":"If you look at my check in history you will see that I'm quite partial to another Pho restaurant in PHX.  It was hard for me to try some place new, but I did.  Glad to say that I'm HAPPY I did. Food was great!  Spring rolls were fresh, egg rolls delicious, pho so flavorful.  To top it off I was actually thanked for my business.  It is that last sentence that will have me returning to Pho Noodles.   Many good wishes for your success Pho Noodles, and I \"thank you\" also."}
{"text":"Finally a Pho place close to home! If you're looking for a variety of dishes at a decent price, then this is your place. The broth is so delicious ( you can judge a good pho place by its broth) The staff is super friendly and the restaurant is very clean. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The broth i just opened and sipped was all OIL.  I almost threw up. It stayed on my upper lip like petroleum.  Super disappointed because they are so close to my house.  The spring rolls I had were ok and maybe they are good with other dishes but for me, NEVER again."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about pho but I completely fell in love with this small restaurant ! I always get the pho shrimp. Amazing taste and staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Came in here based on the reviews alone! Get number 29. It is the pho with beef chicken and shrimp it is delicious! The broth is amazing! Do get the sampler appetizer. The shrimp rolls,calamari garlic wings and pork roll are delicious. The service is a bit slow... but worth the wait, this place gets very very busy. They do takeout. They accept credit cards. Each dish is a about $7-8."}
{"text":"Very good pho. I dropped in for a carryout order and was served very quickly and politely. Next time, I will use the menu they gave me to order ahead. And I think I'll always get takeout, since the dining area is clean but pretty basic."}
{"text":"Pretty good not my personal fav but close 2nd. Nice part is u actually have a waiter but some of the service is still lacking (my friend said she was double charged for coffee), some food was missing garnishes, coffee in plastic cup instead of brewed at table...etc. Its also slightly more expensive than where i normally go n the presentation of food not quite as nice."}
{"text":"As a vegan, its pretty hard to find decent vegan food. This restaurant has the best tofu vegetable pho I've ever had. I really think this is a very vegan friendly restaurant. Also, although  they were very busy at the time I went, the servers were attentive and very nice."}
{"text":"Great food hit my Vietnamese fix! Beef brisket pho, bbq beef sandwich is my go-to combo here!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pho, I had the #29. The egg rolls were very tasty too. The staff was super friendly.  Nice clean addition to our Midtown neighborhood"}
{"text":"Before Pho Noodles i used to go to Pho Thanh. Pho Than is a bit cheaper, but only by a few cents-$1. Pho Noodles does have a smaller space but it's not cramped. They have better customer service. The staff actually smiled and they didn't make me feel rushed to order.   I ordered #24 and it was very savory. The steak had flavor and the broth was also very good."}
{"text":"Very small place with tasty food. Their pho was amazing, I enjoyed the meatball pho very much. Service was top notch and fast, we were welcomed and also checked upon constantly if we needed anything else. The only minor issue I have is seating, we were there and there was only on table left and was so close to the door and blocked it in a way, and blocked customers from leaving from one side of the isle and had to go all the way around to leave. Hopefully next time I go I can get a bette place as I enjoyed the service, the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! To my Tum...Tum... Today was my first time in and I am Pho Crazy about this place. The small menu has a variety of many options to choose from. If your a vegetarian, seafood or meat eater you will find something here. Today I ordered the Chicken Soup and my friend ordered Teriyaki Chicken. My soup was served fast while pipping hot. Had all the vegetable fixins with it. The broth was amazingly flavored. I dipped my fork into my friends platter and let's say I am ordering that when I come back. The sauce on the Teriyaki Chicken has a hint of something to give it a nice kick.   Price point was perfect for every budget. My soup was $6.95 and my friends order was part of the lunch special for $9.95. Which included rice and steamed veggies that came with the Teriyaki Chicken.   The staff was very welcoming and friendly. Service with a big smile."}
{"text":"Never disappointed! Veggie options, my man loves the pho here. There really isn't anything you order here that isn't wonderful. The atmosphere is pretty usual for a small restaurant like this but it's quaint and clean. The service is out of this world. I mean every time we come they remember us, our order and always serve with a smile. Super quick. I can't say enough about this place. You have got to try it. We have tried many places but nothing has topped this place! Come and try and you'll leave with a smile and will love the service! Most everyone that comes in is a regular. You've gotta come!"}
{"text":"Great tasting veggie pho. We ordered the extra large and it came with a bunch of noodles and veggies. The tofu spring roll was okay, but seemed kinda soggy, I'll probably pass on that next time."}
{"text":"Love love this place! We are regulars at this place. They always have customers so you know it's good. They have delicious vegetarian/vegan options! The food taste very authentic and home cooked. veggie pho its flavorful and filling. I also love the crispy tofu with rice. But my personal favorite is the teriyaki tofu and veggies with rice! Yummmm. I haven't had anything besides the vegetarian options but the other stuff looks good as well. My family loves this place too, which is awesome. I highly recommend this place. It's very clean and simple. And the owner is so sweet! She calls us the \"tofu family\" she's so sweet and always makes sure we love our food. If you're around the area defiantly go try the food there! :)"}
{"text":"This local Vietnamese Noodle restaurant has become popular in our neighborhood since it opened. The food is excellent, creatively done and better than in other such places, the service is good, the quantities are very large and the prices are very reasonable.   We have been there twice around lunch time but the hours are early to late. We will be there tonight with a friend. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Decent food, but terrible service. We came here because the pho restaurants we normally go to in downtown were closed, but my experience at Pho Noodles did not live up to my expectations.    For starters, they did not know how to seat people (they seated a party of 2 at a 4-person table when there was a 2-person table open, so that larger parties were unable to be seated). Plus, they small restaurant with no waiting area, so people have to wait basically hovering over people while they eat. Also, as I was having dinner, there was a line of people waiting for their \"To Go\" food and almost all of the customers had to wait 25+ minutes to receive their food, constantly reminding them that they were waiting for carry out orders.   Food-wise, the BBQ pork Banh mi lacked meat and I could mainly taste bread. Their Pho Tai was good, but nothing stellar. And their boba was a little over cooked, so it didn't have that chewy consistency that boba normally has.   Overall, we had to wait a very long time to be seated and then again to order and then receive food. I wouldn't have a huge issue with this if the meal seemed worth it, but I wasn't very impressed by what we received. I don't plan to return here the next time I am craving a warm bowl of pho."}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the best pho i have ever eaten and the spring rolls are to die for...will continue to go back here when im in the area."}
{"text":"So not worth it. Spring rolls were good but thats about it. Meat in the pho was skimpy and for a to go order the meat wasnt cooked at all. Will not be back ever I have had better Pho from other places."}
{"text":"Just had take-out! Wow! So good. We live very close and this will probably be out new favorite! Thanks for opening in the neighborhood! We needed and great lil' place like this. We'll be back and often!"}
{"text":"Out of the way Restaurant in a small shopping strip mall.  Order d the vegetarian pho. Veggie broth! Banh mi sandwich was delicious with tofu. Huge servings.  Excellent service.   Pleasant meal.   Recommended."}
{"text":"My first time here and I'm a little disappointed. I ordered the Chicken curry and the lady persisted to tell me that it was light meat when it's obviously not, then when I told her I didn't want it and wanted to reorder she said no?   My Mom ordered the chicken pho ga and the white eat was white and tender. The chicken in the curry was fatty and veiny and dark meat. Had to wonder if it was chicken livers. Gross"}
{"text":"This place is nothing fancy, but who cares when the food is good! FINALLY, a good sized bowl of pho for a reasonable price! Oh and the service is friendly and fast! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Totally slow. We waited over 45 minutes for soup? Asked multiple times for staff to check on our order and nothing came out. Service is awful!!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a corner shopping center this place was a well kept secret the last year or so.  Fresh crisp vegetables, a robust flavorful broth cooked for hours, and hand made noodles in each pho! The time & quality this place puts into their dishes shows when they come out to greet & serve you.  Don't just take THE DUKE'S word for it or maybe you can. Absolutely delish!   Top Picks: #1 #13 BBQ Pork #23"}
{"text":"The pho is delicious i had to sip all my soup. The taro drink is perfectly sweet. The service can improve. We can easily tell this is a family own business and the 2 young servers still have alot of experience to gain.   Service and communication is key.  We ran out of water and never got refills or asked if everything was okay but notice other customers were getting better service.   I'll give them another go. Hope its better this time"}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot. The staff seems a little out of it sometimes though lol but that's ok. As long as the food is good. What I thought of the food...the Banh Mi needed more vietnamese mayo and less lemongrass, aside from that the thit nuong was cooked well. The bread had a nice crunch, but also soft/fluffy. The ca phe sau da was on point. I have been back a few times for it already. It was delicious. The price was also perfect!   I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner a couple months ago, just a week after they had opened. The service was wonderful and the food was delicious. We ordered the egg rolls and the chicken noodles soup. It was so good...so flavorful...so filling! I don't often find myself eating vietnamese food, but when I do, I am quite satisfied."}
{"text":"Brought a new friend in with us to try our favorite new Pho place! He ordered the seafood Pho, I ordered the #29 combo and spring rolls. My boyfriend ordered the BBQ beef bahn mi and the house fried rice. My friend was very pleased with his dish, the seafood ball things was a little odd but he still enjoyed it. My Pho was phenomenal and the spring rolls are always tasty. I prefer the BBQ pork to the BBQ beef but it was still very good and my boyfriend loved the fried rice. This place was slammed at 7:30 on a Thursday night be service was still good, food came quick and hot, and we all loved our dishes."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Pho place in Phoenix. The chicken pho is amazing -- the broth is as good as it gets. The shrimp rice rolls are perfect. Whenever I start to feel like I'm getting a cold, I head straight to Pho Noodles and double down on the broth. The service is great and the staff is most kind."}
{"text":"The food was GREAT and nice friendly atmosphere! You'll Love it! Alot of neighborhood locals who couldn't say enough wonderful things about Pho Noodle. They're RIGHT!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so I love this place and have always dined in..But today I ordered take out for the first time and come to find the meat included in my pho noodles was raw and uncooked?! The hell?! Is this how it's always served to go? Needless to say I will never order take-out for lunch again!"}
{"text":"Oh sweet PHO goodness... Finally a great Vietnamese restaurant in the area without going further into the west valley.    Small place, but very clean and staff was very friendly.  My GF loves the vegetarian options and loved that the Veggie Pho even came with actual veggie broth.    I ordered the beef pho and it was outstanding.  The broth had depth and was extremely flavorful.  Could easily order a cup of this and drink it from a mug.    I will easily be coming back here for my Pho over DaVang."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have a Pho spot within walking distance of my house.   The place is small so you can sometimes expect a rush, but it is work the wait.   The grilled pork bahn mi was delicious and filling and only 4 bucks (whoohoo)!  The soups have all  been flavourful, spicy and generous in the serving size. I had them both as dine in and carry out and the quality stayed the same.  The service has always been excellent. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I don't know why since e first moved here there were some people that we've met up here in Scottsdale saying there was no good restaurant in the desert to eat PHO. So I've been kinda bummed because we love eating PHO and having to find this place is a gem. Thanks to Yelp we said \"Let's just chance it and try it out for ourselves!\" and you know what, it was really good.  I love the egg rolls it was a small dish but, it was delicious...I love eating it with all the fixings it's so delicious and I love their pho. The customer service though is mehh we had to waive someone down for water service and our check. But, the food here is delicious"}
{"text":"This place is always clean and the staff is super friendly!  We have been here now 5-6 times and the food is always on point, we have not tried everything yet as I can't seem to get past the Pho and Bun's to try other items on the menu.  If you are craving some Pho, then you need to head here and give it a try, I dont think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have to preface this review by stating that I work in Downtown Phoenix, and its been a struggle to find a solid, tasty, quick, relatively close pho place over the past three years. Me and a coworker had a monstrous craving for pho, and I decided I'd ask the Yelp Gods for help finding somewhere to go.  I'm not sure how I missed this place before. I'm not sure how long they've been open. I'm not sure how my life ever felt complete without coming here once a week for some grub.  It's a relatively small spot with a few 2 and 4 person tables. The staff greets you and helps you find a seat immediately, which is surprising given how busy they are during the lunch hour. When it comes to pho, I generally know what I want (easy rare pho, which is #23 at Pho Noodles, and some thai tea) and they are always quick to ask what I want. You know whats crazy, though? They're even quicker to bring out your food, which is fantastic when you're on a one hour lunch break and have to rush back to the office for a meeting.  I suppose I should talk more about the food? The pho is ridiculously good. It's hard to explain, because its not necessarily the *best* pho I've ever had, but it's exactly what I'm looking for, at the perfect price point, and the perfect location.  When me and my pho-loving homegurl coworker leave, our bill is about $22 for two bowls and two teas. Doesn't get much better than that."}
{"text":"The service here is generally very good, except that when I gets very full they appear understaffed and I could take a little while. Everyone is very courteous, the food is solid, the beef pho is absolutely wonderful.If one is in the area and has a little time to relax and wait I can be a perfect place for lunch."}
{"text":"So tasty!  The spring rolls were fresh and delicious.  The Pho had a rich and fragrant broth - great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place has absolutely the best Pho I've had in Phoenix. I went to college where they had a pho places everywhere but out here they are hard to come by. To date this is one of the tastiest places I've been to. The portions are good and the flavors are great. I did order a Thai tea with boba, the flavor of the tea was bland but the bobba was perfect. I would 100% recommend this place"}
{"text":"We are from San Diego, and this place was our first place to have food in AZ. This is a nice restaurant. Fast services and very delicious food. My boy friend is a picky people, but he loved Pho in here. He said this place has the best Pho compare to San Diego. Also, cheap price."}
{"text":"This is the best pho I have had since I started eating pho. I have been to several pho restaurants around the Valley; Tempe, Mesa and Glendale- and this is hands down the best of the bunch- and those other phos were very good-  The pho ga is rich and has pulled chicken breast, not the typical over boiled sliced chicken. The spring rolls are also fantastic and their house fried rice is full of buttery flavor and veggies. My fave!"}
{"text":"Pho-king great service. Had my order taken and brought out right away, and was promptly served any thing requested. The food itself was the exact kind of Pho-king food I was looking for! Will be making Pho Noodle my regular pho-king spot for sure."}
{"text":"Great pho at a great price! And very quick! 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Ordered to go.. vegetarian and ga Pho.  The broth had far to much Anise.  But the kicker was..when we opened the pho ga, there was no chicken.  We also got an order of egg roll that were so small it took one bite to eat.  Won't go back"}
{"text":"Nothing was left on the table by the time we had finished. Leaning back in his chair, my husband said,\"That was everything I wanted.\" My response was, \"That's what she said\". Seriously though, we will return weekly. Really great Pho. Excellent spring rolls with a peanut sauce I've never tasted before. Thai Tea balanced the salt of the Pho. It was perfect and we will return to try everything on the menu. Thank you for bringing this goodness into our neighborhood. So happy about that! Pho Noodles!"}
{"text":"I go here pretty often. They always get my order right. The owner is very friendly as well. It's a great hangout spot for me and my friends. But it is very compact. There was this one incident where the waiter said I could sit where ever I want. So I sat at a table where I felt comfortable. But the owner told me to move even when I said it's okay. But I ended up moving where he told me to. The sun was glaring in my face. I just felt as if I didn't need to be bother when I was already settled in. I will still go here though. :)"}
{"text":"I love Pho and ate it weekly until I became a vegetarian. It is really difficult to find a great veggie pho and I finally found it! Pho noodles has the best veggie pho I have ever eaten! The broth is amazing and they fill it to the brim with fresh veggies. My husband who is an omni ordered the beef and he too thought it was the best pho he has ever eaten! This place is a must try! Also we had excellent service which is always a treat when the food is this great!"}
{"text":"Very good.  The broth was very rich.  I haven't had broth this good in the valley.  It's almost comparable to Viet Noodle Bar in Vegas.  The tendon and the rare beef were both tender and had a lot of flavor.    The pork/shrimp spring rolls were fresh and sticky.  Just like I like them.    Huge portions.  Friendly service.  And the A/C works!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but I've been disappointed both times. Maybe it's because I got togo?   The good: Grilled pork in banh mi had good flavors.  The bad: Bread was cold and not toasted enough, I work off thomas and central so it should be warm still by the time I get back to the office.  Mayonnaise is a poor substitute for pate. No jalapenos in the sandwich (a staple in banh mi). Vietnamese iced coffee had creamer in it (almost blasphemy).  I will say, the pho was relatively good from what I can remember so stick to their soup based and rice dishes.  Overall, probably won't come back. Too much against and not enough for from my experience."}
{"text":"Very good! It was very clean and the food was yummy and fresh! They have lots of different items so you don't just have to get Pho."}
{"text":"I love this place. My favorite dish to order is the Salt and Pepper Tofu. The tofu is lightly battered tossed in jalapenos and onions and served with white rice and veggies. The egg rolls are also a delight. If your in the area definatly give this place a try."}
{"text":"It was OK....it could of been better honestly but I rather go to my regular spot called egg roll at avondale and dysart!"}
{"text":"It's cheap decent pho.. it's a small place with friendly staff.. The only thing I can say negatively about this place is that they got my spring roll order mixed up.. it's not Pho Thanh but this place wasn't bad.."}
{"text":"Closest pho place near central. I love coming here for the chicken pho, the broth is perfect. The spring rolls come in orders of two with the peanut sauce which is also very yummy. The place itself is very small, but very clean and the staff is always very nice."}
{"text":"Today was my 2nd time coming here. The first time here actually wAs my first time experiencing pho! I love it! This place is super cute and clean, has super friendly and attentive servers. The food is fresh! Today, I tried their Thai tea. So delicious."}
{"text":"The pacing of food delivery is critical to the satisfaction of an entire table.  Food should come out as a Table and not individually. This restaurant failed to make the dining experience pleasant.  I will not be returning.   The food once it was delivered was good."}
{"text":"The meals I've had here were the closest to what my mother would have made at home and/or what I grew up on when the family went out to eat. The com thit nuong (grilled pork with rice) is spot on; takes me back when I was a little kid and making my mom order that for me. The pork is tender and flavorful. The nuoc mam (fish sauce with sugar, garlic, chili, and lime) was perfect and complimented the pork well. The pork and shrimp spring rolls are authentic; novice, non-Vietnamese patrons may think the spring rolls itself are kind of bland, which they're supposed to be. The pork and shrimp are usually boiled in water. That's it. The spring roll is supposed to have a subtle, yet fresh flavor. The stronger, bolder flavored peanut sauce is what brings it all together. Even the decor is what I'd find in my grandmas house. Pretty legit. Will come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic find in the Phoenix area.  Was a highly rated place via Yelp and did not disappoint.  Place was packed on a Sunday afternoon.  Quite possibly the best place of fried rice I have had while living in Arizona.  The chicken had a nice coating of curry flavored seasoning which added a nice element to the dish.  Will be back very soon to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"We moved down to Phoenix from Seattle and this is the best Pho I have had since moving. I really like the broth, the rare beef is great! The brisket was too fatty for me though. Overall, awesome though"}
{"text":"Glad we have pho in walking distance! Clean restaurant, friendly service, great food (big portions for a low price). We'll be visiting again"}
{"text":"The server was sweet, the food came out timely, hot and was delicious. Forgot a few things but was quick to fix the issue. Really enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. I would recommend Pho Noodles to friends and family."}
{"text":"Just left this place and was very disappointed. The pho was okay. Asked for filet pho got regular beef. Asked for lemon in my water got a dry lime sliver. The spring rolls were filled with bag lettuce and the crepe was super greasy.  Guess I'll be going back to Pho Than :/"}
{"text":"Tonight we went and tried this new place out it, was delicious. We ordered appetizers spring rolls with shrimp,  pork Vietnamese egg rolls with pork and vegetables. For dinner my husband got a house stir-fried noodle dish that had vegetables, shrimp, beef & chicken.  I felt like Pho so I ordered #22 Noodle with rare steak flank, tenderloin, tripe & meat balls. I'll be completely honest with you regarding the pho it had the best broth I've ever had. I've tried several places around the valley that have high ratings for authentic pho and this place beat them all. We also enjoyed a Thai tea with boba it was the perfect accompaniment to complete our meal. The owners of the restaurant are very kind,  courteous and genuinely appreciated our business. Right now they have a grand opening special 10% off your bill. Go try them out today and I know you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing! Been 3 times in less than 2 weeks! only reason it is that low is because I was out of town! I had it for lunch and I would again for dinner!"}
{"text":"Love! Fantastic pho and bahn mi and GREAT prices! Four stars because I think I can find better, TBD."}
{"text":"Best Pho and vegetarian options in the area, next level customer service as well as food."}
{"text":"This is a cute hidden place in downtown Phoenix. Great atmosphere. The pho is yummy yet not the absolute best I've had due to smaller serving size. However, if you're looking for a decent bowl of pho for super low price, definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very low key unassuming place in a strip mall. I always walked by it on my way to Safeway and noticed the steady stream of customers. This led me to try it and I was very happy I stopped in! The pho is amazing and the service is too. I really love how the food is the centerpiece. There's no frills but the food speaks for itself!"}
{"text":"It's all about quality over quantity here. Awesome service too. This is our new Pho spot and we're so lucky cause it's a 10min walk from our house!!!"}
{"text":"A Hole in the wall that is amazing. Always fresh, and quick. Prices are amazing, but the food is the main reason you go there right?? I love the Chicken Teriyaki... It comes broken down into separate section, and you combine it. SOOO AMAZING!!!   The PHO's are the best in the area. I spent every Sunday going around the area trying other Pho's. They had the best broth hands down!!  Go In! Won't be disappointed....   Marc"}
{"text":"I was surprised to find a place so close downtown that served authentic Vietnamese food. To my delight this food was served very hot, full of flavor, and seems very authentic. Servers are Vietnamese and so is the cuisine. They serve a huge variety of dishes... Mostly phone noodles, many bowls of variety.  For my first visit I opted for stirfried rice noodles. They were very good!"}
{"text":"Discovered this awesome, delicious neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant when my brother was in town and was craving Pho.    Prices are inexpensive, the Pho and Bahn Mi sandwiches are delicious.  Really enjoyed my barbecue pork bahn mi and at $3.5 who can complain about the price.  Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great chicken and shrimp pho soup. I requested spicy but it was not. Ingredients fresh and service very good."}
{"text":"PHONTASTIC!!! There is a reason why this place is completely packed during lunch hour. Nestled inside the north east corner of 7th Ave and Osborn, I was happy to know that a new Pho place opened up closer to my office. As I walk in through the doors, you see every customer enjoying the food they are being served. I am the crazy pho lady who loves her Pho Tai and Pho Noodles makes it to perfection. I have been coming here weekly for the past month and will be coming back weekly!!  Thank you Pho Noodles!"}
{"text":"This was a quick stop for me and my buddy after i went shoe shopping.  We came in and since it was that odd...like 3-4 pm hour where people aren't eating, it was empty and we were the only people there.    I had a bowl of the special combination pho noodles, extra large i believe and it was huge.  It was a lot of food and really good.  We also ordered the spring rolls, but they were only Ok.  The bill was cheap for what we had.    It really had that hole in the wall feel and felt like every other viet restaurant i've been to, so it has a nostalgic feeling even though i've never been there before."}
{"text":"So happy with this new pho spot! The pho broth is delicious and very clean (no fat). I can also recommend their egg rolls. The staff is very kind and the restaurant itself is very clean/tidy. The decor is also cute! The only thing I would say they could improve upon is having some music playing to give the place a little more vocal warmth, as it is very quiet.  Definitely give this place a chance :)"}
{"text":"The best pho I've had in phoenix. Very tasty broth with good noodles. I would have liked more condiments, but no restaurants in Phoenix have enough condiments.   Eat here. It's great!"}
{"text":"Pho-king awesome!  I eat Pho Tai at least once an week during the colder months, my go-to place has been Moto simply because it's close to home, I'm lazy, and I typically do take out on the way home from work.    Pho Noodles opened my eye's to what inferior Pho I have been settling for!!   This place is still not far from home, and the broth is DELICIOUS, the fixings were fresh, and damn, it just tasted soooo much better.  I was definitely settling by not wanting to venture too far west for some of the other authentic options.  Parking was convenient and the place looked clean.  No longer must I settle for subpar Pho!"}
{"text":"Came here during lunch one day with a work friend. I pass by the shop every day on my way to work and finally decided to try it out. Let me start by saying I love Pho and will eat it every chance I get. Morning, Noon, and night so to find a place that is super close to my work is fantastic. I have to say the Pho at this location is GREAT. The broth is very flavorful, the portions are just right, it's fast, and reasonably priced! I might even dub this as my favorite Pho place yet!"}
{"text":"Pho noodles is a good compromise if you're looking for decent Vietnamese food, but you want a newer, cleaner environment in which to get it. The restaurant is a bit more modern than other nearby Vietnamese restautants. They offer a good variety of Vietnamese foods, way more than just pho. Having just visited Vietnam, I wanted to try something I had eaten there and ordered the bun bo hue. It was tasty and spicy. The meat in it was not as good as it was in Vietnam, but the broth was on point. My dining companion had the pho, and it was tasty as well. Next time I visit I want to try the bun xeo, which is something they don't serve everywhere. The prices here  are higher than the older places by a few dollars per dish. I think if I were getting take out, I'd for sure get my fave Vietnamese (da vang), but if I were eating in the restaurant, I would come here."}
{"text":"I'm in town for the week, and was looking for a place nearby with vegetarian options. I found Pho Noodles on Yelp and after reading the reviews was excited to try it.   It didn't disappoint! Delicious cheap food that came out very quick!  I got my veggie and tofu spring rolls in under 5 minutes! My fresh taro smoothie came out soon after and the delicious Veggie Pho less than 10 minutes after my spring rolls. Everything was very authentic and tasty. The restaurant itself was clean and not too packed around 7pm, but with a decent number of people coming in and out. Clearly a popular place, and after eating the delicious food I can see why! I will be back next time I'm craving Pho in Phoenix"}
{"text":"This place is great! Delicious, quick service, cheap and friendly! I keep coming back.   The pho here is sweet and savory at the same time, and the small (huge) costs only $6.95. I keep thinking I should get the kids size but then again, it's that good."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food, the tea was good too. It was nice and calm while I was there and could enjoy the person I was with along with the food. You don't find that often in central Phoenix. Sure they didn't give me a fortune cookie but still a great place."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!!  Talk about a place hidden.  My boyfriend and I stumbled on this Pho place about a year ago and we love it.  Food always tastes fresh and even the vegetables they bring for the Pho is green and fresh.  Definitely a place to visit and enjoy the food, service is awesome too as everyone is attentive and friendly!!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, but they did have an unreasonable waiting time- probably an hour before our food came and it wasn't even that busy. In fact, a few people left because it took so long for their food to come out. In short, quality food but bad waiting time."}
{"text":"They sure cook up a delicious Bahn Mi!  Can't wait to come again for some pho."}
{"text":"These wings are amazing! I got the spicy chicken wings and they were my favorite part of the meal, though they're not that spicy I must say. The sauces on the table help combat that though. The soup that came after complimented my appetizer well and it makes me say that I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Really great service with really great quality food came here with my family twice this week. Can't get enough of Pho especially from this place one of. My new favorite places to go. I recommend anyone who love Vietnamese noodles to come here."}
{"text":"I go here 2 times a week.. need I say more?! Haha!! I just love their veggie pho when I'm feeling vegetarian and I love their shrimp pho when I'm feeling shrimparian haha! Love their broth, Yumm and their Vietnamese coffee it's strong and sweet! Just how I like it!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and an attentive staff. I can't say whether it's the best pho in the city but it's very good and if you're craving some pho or just want some brothy soup you can't go wrong here. Large bowls will be sure to fill up the hungriest person and if not there is a lot more to the menu. I add two big spoonfuls of chilli sauce (is that what it's called?)."}
{"text":"Had a few great dishes here. The veggie pho was tasteful and the chicken bahn mi (not on the menu) was tasty as well. The kids enjoyed the noodles web veggie and tofu as well. The service is a tad lacking but it's likely due to being a new restaurant. Glad this place is in the hood. Good food.   Update:   The experience has lowered my rating. First, they continually mess up our order and then they ran a $60 charge on my CC for a $37 meal. Normally not a problem except that the experience also involved the gentleman who works there disciplining my 4 year old child. If you have children, find a more kid friendly restaurant unless you want the staff to get upset with your kid, for being a kid. This was our last visit here. Time for a new Pho place."}
{"text":"Excellent pho, especially the broth. Rich and flavorful, well balanced. Spring rolls were very good, nicely wrapped and perfect ratio of fillings.   Pretty interior decor, much nicer than some strip mall places.   Convenient location, easy parking.  Unfortunately, the servers lack even basic training. We had to ask (numerous times) for everything - water, a tea refill, sprouts/basil plate that accompanies pho, etc. With practice, they'll improve I am sure. All of the staff was friendly and nice."}
{"text":"First time here. Found this restaurant on yelp. Called to see if they were open on New Year's Day. Vet pleasant lady answered the phone. The restaurant is very nice. The Pho was fantastic. The service and price for 2 meals are fantastic."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Vietnamese food. The Pho is delicious, broth is rich and not watery. I had their combination soup and the portion was good and enough for two to split. The grilled pork Banh Mi was good, different that usual with cucumber and no jalapenos. Next time Inam having them add them for a little kick."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out, so husband and I went  on a rainy weeknight when it seemed like the perfect dish. The food was tasty and affordable and the restaurant was clean. It was pretty busy, so it took awhile for them to take our order even though we were sat at a table right away. Food came out quick and did not disappoint. So glad to have a new yummy spot nearby. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place. Friendly service. Good food. Much cleaner than the other pho places and friendly service. They actually talk to you and see how the meal is. Love close to my home."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times on different days and at different times. They have a consistent flow of customers but I've always been able to get a table. I usually get the egg rolls, pho, and Thai tea. They always have fast service and the food is always tasty.  The service is good and I enjoy stopping in when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Pho is ok. Not bad, not exceptional either. Some days the broth is just right, some days it is totally bland. There's just no consistency to it.   Anyway, my main complaint is about this restaurant's service. It's always slow, no matter what time of day it is. The last time my family and I were there the place was mostly empty, yet it took awhile for someone to hand us a menu. After waiting for a few more minutes the waiter served us glasses of water. All of us took a sip and grimaced at the taste. There was a plasticky taste to it; either they didn't wash the cups properly or the water container. The waiter looked annoyed and incredulous when we told him we wanted another batch. Eventually, with great reluctance, he took our glasses back to the kitchen. We were all taken aback by his attitude. The waiter came back with supposedly new glasses of water, but it tasted the same. Ugh.   I decided after this incident that I'm better off going somewhere else. There are other better pho places in Phoenix, like Da Vang. The food there is always excellent, and the waiters there are quite friendly and won't give you any attitude."}
{"text":"Went on a whim with a co-worker over lunch. Great prices, delicious food, generously portioned. Had chicken beef & shrimp over crispy noodles - tender meats, yummy sauce, veggies just the right amount of crisp. My associate enjoyed his huge, beautifylly presented bowl of pho. The staff was sweet & helpful. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Update:. Returned to try Bon Bo Hue, good, but the soup lacked the congealed pig blood you commonly find in this beef (Bo) soup of Hue city.  The noodles (Bon) were also thinner than I like in this soup, but were still good.  The taste was ok.  3.5 stars for the Bon Bo Hue. ________  The more I eat Ramen, the less I like Pho.  I'm just not sure why that is.  But I was pleasantly surprised to find this Vietnamese restaurant while passing through Midtown.  Conveniently located at Osborn and 7th Ave in the Safeway parking lot. It is easy to get to and there is plenty of parking in this \"Off-Central Ave\" midown location.  This restaruant opened in a hostile environment.  There are no less than 3 very good contenders for the best Pho in Phoenix within about 3-5 miles.  For me, this place has the best tasting broth and the ingredients were fresh and delicious.  The broth had the right complex depth of taste that you get from the long process it takes to make it.  Their broth is A-1!  I had a nice bowl of Pho with everything in it.  I also tried their banh xeo.  I enjoyed both dishes a lot.  The bahn xeo was a little bit greasy, but it was very tasty.   The Bahn xeo is large, I would advise planning on sharing it if you are ordering a main course.  The staff was very gracious when we had an order mix-up.  I appreciated them replacing our spring rolls with eggrolls.   Return Factor: 90%"}
{"text":"YASS PHO YASS! I have been waiting forever for central Phx to have some GOOD pho. I either had to drive to west Phx or Mesa, which is unacceptable! Pho Noodle is a cozy, often jam-packed restaurant with delicious pho, spring rolls and great people. You see all sorts in here because if you make good broth, they will come!! When things get wild in there, service can slow down, but it's worth it. Maybe I'll go tomorrow..."}
{"text":"Really love this place! The food is so great! If you like Pho, I totally recommend this ace."}
