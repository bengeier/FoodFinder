{"text":"We ordered the chicken tikka, dal makhani, chicken korma, and matar paneer - we ordered everything VERY mild and that's just how it came!  We loved everything and recommend this restaurant to anyone! Awesome Indian food!  Helpful and friendly staff!  Terrific atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food.....one of the dish we have to leave after initial tasting. It was so hot that we were offered yogurt.  It may be a bad day for the restaurant. I believe it's over rated."}
{"text":"\"Best curry I've ever had, even back home in India\" - Said my colleague who I took there for lunch last week. 

When a business colleague wanted to take us out, he suggested an Indian place he likes in Burlington. I suggested Coriander Green and the two gentlemen from India that came with us were very impressed.
I'm always impressed but I wouldn't call myself an expert.

I've been a fan since I tried their Butter Chicken at the Midnight Madness downtown years ago.  
I love their Butter Chicken, Chicken Korma and the Onion Bhaji. 
Don't get the CG Special Naan..too rich. Just buttered naan is best for my tastes anyways.
It IS a good dinner date place, but you will smell like curry afterwards... just know that in advance :)"}
{"text":"Great place. Decor was nice, atmosphere was nice. Servers were great! We ordered the samosas which were delicious, butter chicken which was incredible, the Chana Masala  (not the best I've tried but my bf loved it) and we had rice, naan bread, and this other whole wheat layered bread which was awesome too. My bf had 2 Indian beers. After tip and tax it was about $100, a little on the pricier side but for a nice occasion it's ok to spend the money."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try the food after all the great reviews. I ordered chicken curry, chicken biryani and naan. Asked it to be mild. I found the dishes to be very spicy and not flavorful. I understand people can have different definitions for mild and for me the food was super spicy.
But what upset me was the server came to us on his own to ask if the food was fine and we told him that it was spicy.  He offered to take the dishes back to fix them. Then suggested he will get some yogurt instead. To our surprise we were charged for the yogurt which was offered as solution to the spicy food and then we were made to pay for it.
The food is not good and over priced!!!!"}
{"text":"Great find in downtown Oakville. Very nice atmosphere and the food was just fantastic. Some of the best Indian food I have had in a while. Great staff. Very friendly. Highly recommend. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Service not so great but they did make it up to us. Very authentic flavours. Moderate pricing. Great place to take a date. I know because there were so many guys there with dates."}
{"text":"Traveling to Oakville area, I found the place and was able to stop in for a late diner. Very nice atmosphere and staff - and great food. Comparing to other Indian food places, this was an outstanding experience."}
{"text":"Amazing! Just one word is enough. Good service, food and portions. Loved it. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The best lamb curry and buttered chicken in oakville. A must visit"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly , yet , unfortunately food is seriously bad, specially vendalou shrimp , sorry but shrimp was smelly and obviously expired."}
{"text":"Little bit on the pricey side, but the food was very good. My meal came out tepid so I sent it back to get warmed up...and they refilled my vindaloo! That was nice. Oh, there was a tiny bug on the plate of vegetable pakoras which didn't have wings so it crawled from somewhere, although I couldn't say for sure where. 

Very friendly service who warned me how spicy things would be. I laugh at your warnings! Then I cried privately because it was quite spicy...but delicious!"}
{"text":"By far the best Indian restaurant ever! I love how fresh and non greasy everything is. Awesome service and awesome food!

We've since ordered the lamb curry, butter chicken, chicken korma, plain and garlic naan, vegetable pakora and it was just all phenomenal! You have the option to mild, medium or hot spicy... And if you want to be adventurous you can do a mild to medium.... Which I think is just perfect for those who just want a little kick. :) Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is so genuine! The food was absolutely delicious, and every member of the staff wanted to make sure we were enjoying our dining experience. Totally accommodating to vegetarians. We live in the city, but will definitely be making the drive again!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I ordered the madras chicken curry with a stuffed naan and the food exceeded my expectations. The server was very polite and attentive. However, the prices are quite high. For the 4 of us, we ended up paying around $130 just for main courses, a few naans and a couple of beers.  No appetizers or dessert."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday night with gf. Probably best Indian food I've had in a long time. The onion bhaji was so flavourful...butter chicken was recommended and was super tasty. The server also recommended the cg lamb specialty and this was probably the best dish. We ordered the garlic naan, gf liked it while I thought it was just ok. Highly recommended overall!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Indian food! The chicken tells and butter chicken were incredible. Also the vegetable samosa n garlic butter nan bread were fantastic appetizers. Main dishes good enough each for 2 adults. Excellent friendly service to top it up:)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, super comfy chairs, and the aroma is so delicious your mouth will start watering half a block away. Try the house special curry for sure!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about this dining experience.  Tikka masala and another chicken dish in coconut milk. malai?  We're wonderful. Garlic naan lovely. The service was great  we had a stressful day and the music and quietness of the restaurant was just what we needed"}
{"text":"I've probably had take out here 20 times over the years.   The food quality is great and is consistent.  Pickup time is usually 20 mins and that too is consistent.  Rarely if ever have I had to wait.

We love the Coriander Green Lamb Special, and their other curries.  Onion bajji (sp?) dish is also excellent.  

I haven't ever eaten in their dining room, but the ambiance seems good.  I have never seen it packed, but usually there are 5-6 tables seated when I go in.

The staff seem friendly, and always greet me with a smile. 

Martin"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've ever had. A supplier took us out for lunch, and I'm already looking forward to the next time. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is quite frankly the best Indian restaurant I have ever tried.  The atmosphere is nice, upscale compared to many Indian restaurants.  The food is out of this world.  The lamb vindaloo is delicious, but do try the Coriander grill specials.  They are all delicious.  The subtlety of the spices is a delight to the palate and they seem to effortlessly adjust the spice level to taste ( I love spicy, my wife less so).  Do try Coriander Green.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"In a nice location in downtown Oakville. The food was incredible. I ordered Madras chicken and my wife ordered Marsala fish. We also had samosas for an appetizer and you have to order the naan and rice separately. The quality stands out from all of the previous Indian restaurants that I visited before. However, you have to pay a pretty penny to eat there. Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I ever ate and one of the best overall meals I've ever ate, not kidding, it was incredible. Ordered butter chicken, Chana Masala, Vegetable Korma, Palack Ahloo, and garlic naan for 4 of us. Couldn't recommend this place more. We ate in and service was great (it also wasn't a busy Thursday night) but will definitely be doing takeout as well."}
{"text":"Came here with my dad for dinner after work. I ordered the palak paneer and my dad got the chicken korma. Both with garlic naan. Samosas for apps and a mango lassi to share. We finished off with an Indian masala tea. Food was excellent per usual and service was slow and could have been more attentive. It is expensive.... $70 for two people!! This is my favourite Indian restaurant. Would definitely recommend to others"}
{"text":"I took my mom here for a belated Mother's Day lunch on a Saturday afternoon (so it was my non-vegan day).  It is hidden on a side street straight off Lakeshore and I would have never known about this place had it not been for Yelp.

We ordered the lamb curry and butter chicken (both mild) that came with naan and rice.  Both curries were really good and aromatic.  Everything was very fresh and the decor is pretty nice too.  

The only con about this place is that it's slightly more on the pricey side for around $18-$20 per dish.  However, the service is very nice and is close to the lake in Oakville, so it's kind of expected since food is more expensive in this area than downtown.

Verdict: Pretty good for a decent meal and a special occasion."}
{"text":"Ok, I have to confess I am a little of a wimp when it comes to spices so I dread going to Indian restaurants but my wife loves Indian food so now and then I brave the fire for her. Coriander Green is outstanding, not only do they serve some of the most succulent Indian food around, they can turn the heat up and down on demand without losing any of the flavours. I am really not an expert on Indian cuisine, but this is a place that I enjoy going back to and the staff is always so friendly and helpful. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"After experimenting with the Taste of Oakville I recalled seeing Coriander Green on the list, but didn't make it to their restaurant. So as a going way gift my friends took me here for dinner. A nook in the wall just parallel to Lakeshore Road on Church Street, the restaurant is a quant and cozy place to grab some warm delicious Indian food! This was my second Indian restaurant in about 2 weeks, so I was happy to try some more from a different location. The restaurant wasn't too busy, I would say 3 or 4 tables with people, and we were seated near the window by our choosing. The service was a tad slow with only one main server, so although understandable, awkward at times to be left for so long after we had just arrived. Regardless we were taken care of and the waiter helpful for explaining the dishes and ensuring we were not ordering overly spicy food (all of us weaklings went for mild haha). Our dishes were served at the same time, so we were able to enjoy the food together. The Naan was so delicious, some of us ordered plain, and the others garlic and butter. The main dishes were also heartily enjoyed by us all, nice and steaming hot, they paired really well with our warm naan bread. All of us brought home doggy bags with enough for at least 2 or 3 more meals! The restaurant menu wasn't anything too crazy, had buttered chicken (which according to some is  westernized Indian food), so it would have been nice to have some more authentic Indian dishes on the menu instead of your typical western ones. But I suppose not everyone is as adventuresome. Regardless a good restaurant for those wanting to experiment with something a bit more authentic, although I suggest skipping the butter chicken and trying something new, you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and authentic Indian food. Loved the butter chicken and especially the naan. Be warned that when you order it hot, it will be HOT for all of you spice lovers out there. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Normally my review of Indian food would centre around the balance of flavours in my curry and how spicy they were willing to make my vindaloo. However, one dish was so incredibly and unexpectedly delicious it has muddled all memory of other dishes consumed: the VEGETABLE TIKKA appetizer! 

$17 might seem a little much for a starter, but this dish really IS much more than a starter. The sizzling platter of lightly sauced, well spiced seared peppers, onions and paneer is of  fairly massive proportions; if eaten as an app rather than a main it should be shared among the whole table. I am typically more of a rich and saucy kind of girl and this type of BBQ style food is not my thing-- but this is absolutely one of the best things I have ever eaten. So many incredible flavours meet in this simple dish. The mild tang of the cheese, the rich char and spiced sauce,  and the sweet flavours of the onions (slightly caramalized from the heat) and juicy peppers combine to create an absolutely perfect dish. 

Sum up: Restaurant is beautiful. Service is friendly. Prices are high, but the food is very, very good and the portions are large. I'd give it 5 stars if the prices were cheaper or I was richer. 



*Note: this review is based on an experience around 6 months ago."}
{"text":"This Indian restaurant is outstanding. Authentic cuisine with real Indian spice (heat) when requested. Staff are friendly and making excellent recommendations to please your night out. The decor is traditional with pleasant India music playing softly. The food is to die for. I enjoyed the Lamb Boonah (sorry for my spelling) and Tandoori Chicken. What a feast, can feed two easily."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible!!!

We arrived shortly before closing (about half an hour) and were greeted by a very friendly staff who were very courteous. Service was quick and very good and the food was excellent. I had the chicken biryani and my date had the chicken vindalu, medium spice. Definitely a place we'll visit again."}
{"text":"This is the third Indian restaurant we've tried since moving to the area, and it is by far our favourite. We usually go once a week, at least, and it is great whether you eat it there or get it for take-out. My husband gets the Shrimp korma and I like the shahi paneer. The garlic naan is also delicious. They are willing to do a mild version of the food for wimps like me. After the mild version, it gets spicy quickly, but they can also do half mild and half medium. The restaurant is family-owned, so we see the same people there each time, and they are very friendly. If you go on Friday or Saturday night, it is quite busy and the pace of service is a little slower. Any other time, and it's pretty calm and quick service. The portions are also pretty sizeable, so I usually end up with lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Visited while on business, super friendly staff and loved the Matar Paneer. Ambience is dark but cosy. A welcome add to my Oakville experience."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend for lunch today and I was very excited about trying a descent Indian restaurant in Oakville, with great reviews. 

Unfortunately we couldn't wait until the food was ready. We had a roach walking on our table, right on top of the cutlery. I also had a snack cracker with a piece of black hair in it, which was a total turn off. 

We had to cancel the order and leave the place. The manager was apologetic and nice although my friend and I were too disgusted to stay."}
{"text":"The dish I chose was delicious. Butter chicken with garlic Naan. But the server was at first polite but then when asked if I wanted anything else she followed by a response I hope not. 

Could be a weird sense of humor but not going to complain about the food. Just not a welcoming place unfortunately."}
{"text":"What a great spot!

As I continue my tour learning about the excellent restaurants in Oakville (that apparently I have been missing my first year of being a suburbanite), we found Coriander Green! 

This place is a gem - it's an upscale Indian restaurant, with friendly staff and a welcoming atmosphere - as soon as you come in the smells are intoxicating! 

We tried a variety of dishes, accompanied by a Kingfisher beer (which they serve in copper mugs!). Everything was delicious, flavorful and balanced, with one thing really standing out - GARLIC NAAN!

I think this is the best garlic naan I've ever had in my life. I said it. 

While prices are a bit high (from my Toronto point of view), they are really on par with the area. 

I wouldn't hesitate to come back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing signature Coriander Green Fish curry! Fresh wholesome roti and big glass of lassi!

Usually I start with ambiance but food was mesmerizing so I broke my flow. Decor was pretty cosy with dim lights. Reminded me of old fashioned restaurants back home when everything didn't use to be 'in your face'!

Service was impeccable with our host suggesting that we rather order one curry instead of two since it will be enough. I love the honesty. It shouldn't be about selling food right?

Wish we were staying close by. For An evening with ghazals on the rocks. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love the food here!! The staff is lovely and attentive. I had the lamb madras - very flavourful and spiced just right :). Veggie pakoras were also very tasty"}
{"text":"So, I am new to Canada and this was my first meal in Oakville (this is also my first Yelp review in Canada too).  I'm from the UK, so I am used to good Indian food (Chicken Tikka Masala is the most popular dish in the country.)  Based on the Yelp reviews, I was excited to give this place a try as I had been craving Indian food.

I decided to go for my usual chicken tikka masala so I had a comparison (it was actually called Butter Chicken - aka the US name for CTM).  Based on some other reviews stating the spice level was hot, I opted for medium (as I like spicy food but not burn the roof of my mouth off, sweating buckets, while tearing up hot). 

The service was fine, nothing extraordinary as I was taking the food away and the food was ready in about 20 minutes.  In my opinion, it was expensive...$35 for one meal with rice and a naan bread, but maybe I'm just not used to Canadian prices yet (I came here from the US).  Volume wise, there was plenty of food.  I literally halved the portion so I have another meal for tomorrow (although I'm not a massive eater). 

I knew on my first bite I was not impressed.  First of all, there was absolutely NO heat - this was not the medium spice level I was expecting.  The second mouthful confirmed my worst fears that this was not going to cure my Indian food craving. I can only compare it to the feeling when you take a swig of what you expect is a refreshingly cold, fizzy coke and instead you get that warm, flat syrupy nastiness that is a coke that has been left in a hot car for a hour or two.  Yep - that disappointing.  The naan bread was a little soggy and tasted of a little too much cardamom. Did I eat the meal? Yes, I was starving and I'd paid for it.  Would I order from here again? That's a definite and resounding, no!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, this must be one of the better places I've eaten here in Ontario."}
{"text":"This place hadn't lost it's touch! I had the Lamb Vindaloo, Butter chicken, Lamb Briyani, Special Fish Coriander, Garlic Naan and Mango Lassie. Everything is Delicious! I was here 10 months ago and they still have the organic options available.. I don't think the butter chicken was organic, I buy organic meat sometimes and know what organic meat taste like.. maybe it's because I didn't state organic? Either way, the food is Delicious. I love Indian food, I use to eat it often but I got so sick of it, so now I only eat it, once every 2-3 months.. You need to try this place out, the chef knows how to cook!"}
{"text":"I got take out and it was very sub-par. The vegetable dish was okay but nothing special. Basically steamed cauliflower and potatoes covered in sauce. It wasn't even a curry like I thought it was going to be, just a thin layer of sauce. The rice was plain. The coriander green naan had a spice I didn't like and was pretty soggy. I got these 3 things for $28 total. Wayyyy over priced. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The butter chicken was delicious! The server was really understanding and I remember she said to my friend \"are you actually sure you're going for extra spicy!?!?\" I can tell the server cares. The chef came to our table once to see how's it going. I liked that moment. Naan could have less butter, but I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Well, we've just been to an Indian wedding, and have to say that the food, provided by Coriander Green, supervised by Chef Harminder himself, was absolutely fabulous! The most delectable perfectly spiced Shrimp Curry, Butter Chicken, Lamb Rogan Josh, Vegetarian Dishes (Tawa, Malai Kofta) even the rice was excellent! It is no mean feat to create such unique sauce flavours for each and every dish. Top-notch! We would not hesitate to hire them for any similar event, and can't wait to eat at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Everything tasted extremely salty here. Butter chicken was sour and salty and trust me I've had butter chicken many times!! 

They took it back but still you can't really \"fix\" a salty dish unless you start from scratch. The waiter then said its mainly the tomato and yogurt that gives that taste but honestly I could not eat it. The curry could almost be a marinara sauce because of so much tomato tanginess.

Even if it looked like I barely touched it they still charged us full price. Was hoping they would take it off the bill (considering its overpriced...same price for lunch AND dinner) no one else was in the restaurant. Completely empty. Hmm...

Strange because I totally trusted the review here but unfortunately I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food ! My lunch was Palak Paneer and it was very good. Well done dish with butter naan and rice. My colleagues enjoyed their meals and we would definitely come back for more when in town."}
{"text":"I haven't actually been inside of Coriander Green, but I have eaten food from here twice. The first time was from their stand at Midnight Madness in Downtown Oakville, and their butter chicken was SO good, my Husband and I wanted to have it again. So we ordered take-out - two butter chickens with rice. It was a bit pricey - $40.00 - but you get what you pay for at this restaurant. Their butter chicken is SO delicious and has just the right amount of heat, and we got big portions that we couldn't even finish, so got to have as leftovers the next day.

I definitely want to go sit down and eat sometime. Delicious food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled on this place while visiting a friend in Oakville. We had gone downtown to do a big of shopping and we're getting hungry so we decided to give it a try. 

Both the atmosphere and staff were very welcoming. The menu was extensive and they had some very unique, original home recipes. Hint, it relates to the name of the restaurant. 

We enjoyed a wonderful dinner with great service. I live in Alberta, but will definitely go back."}
