{"text":"We decided to try this place after it changed to Denoras.  The Brooklyn style pizza was excellent but very small for the price.  We decided to try the NY pizza tonight and as I sit waiting for the take out, I notice that all of the outdoor tables are very dirty.  You guys need to step it up in the cleanliness area. I'll report back on the round pie"}
{"text":"Tea was stale, sweeteners had been wet and dried into hard clumps that would not dissolve. Chicken Marsala gravy great but chicken tough and no pasta? Pot of mussels and garlic bread were spot on but not enough to warrant a return visit."}
{"text":"I used to go to the former restaurant here called Crust and it was just OK but the new Owner, DeNora's Ristorante, is EXCELLENT!!!

I usually just order Domino's out of desperation but remembered this location and decided to give it a try. The Owner was there and is extremely friendly and interested in her customer's satisfaction and the food was excellent.

I had the Borough thin crust pizza, meatball sliders, fettuccine alfredo, garlic bread and a couple desserts. I have eaten pizza and Italian food all over the Valey and this is hands down the best pizza in Town! I have no recommendation as to how the food could have been any better (a rarity for me) and am anxious to go back!

Let's support this local business and make sure they prosper so we can all continue to enjoy their food for years to come."}
{"text":"I was a semi fan of Crust's before but I absolutely love love love the new menu of Denoras Restaurant! Service was amazing, very informative of new menu items.. love the family neighborhood feel.  A up! Definitely will continue taking my family here!!  FYI pasta dishes are divine!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Denora's late this afternoon for a to-go pizza.  (We use to regularly get take-out \"Rustica\" pizza ($11ish) from previous owner when it was called \"Crust\".)  
We were really hoping to love this place. 
We ordered the Brooklyn thin crust Margherita pizza with meatball. 
We got home and opened the box and we were astounded at how small it was. (and I mean SMALL!) They charged us $22.27. 
I called them to confirm that they hadn't charged us for someone else order.  They said we were charged properly.
I can confirm that we will not return. The pizza was extremely disappointing. Too many other great pizza places nearby to ever go here again."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza spot!  Pepperoni Pizza was delicious and DeNora the owner was really nice.  Will definitely be back again. Give this place a try the next time you're in the mood for Pizza."}
{"text":"Came to this place because a buddy was raving how good the pizza was.  Ordered the chicken and sausage. Was delicious.  Had a few cocktails. Great place. Good atmosphere.  Great night with friends."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the service and the quality of food that they have here. The service was something that I have never experienced before, it was absolutely perfect. The meatballs and pizza was amazing as was their burrata. I will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here shortly after they opened under the new name. I'm not sure if that is what the wait was so long (about 40 minutes from order to food) . The food was average but one thing I had never experienced before is an Italian restaurant that doesn't serve complimentary bread with their entrees. I had to order the garlic bread which was like $7 to have bread on the table."}
{"text":"DeNora's Ristorante is a small Italian Restaurant with a bar and a patio. They offer Italian style dinners, a ravioli of the day and an assortment of pizzas.

I think the sweet spot here are the pizzas........because those garlic knots we tried were absolutely delicious and I noticed other customer's pizza that truly looked amazing.....

What drew me here was the dinner menu. They offered some Italian Dishes you just don't find at most Italian restaurants. In short the dinners we tried did not meet our expectations. I note nothing was horrible but really both dinners weren't served as described. I note I was also wrong not to tell the owner about my dinner but I didn't feel like complaining after my husband complained about his dinner. AGAIN nothing was horrible but both dinners weren't prepared as they should be.

The owner seemed very nice and also was understanding. She even took my husband's dinner off the bill when we asked her not to.

I think the sweet spot here are the pizzas.

 I must rate this restaurant at three stars because I have some reservations. Three stars means A-OK in Yelp and nothing is bad about a positive A-OK...."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood restaurant! Service is super friendly and food is great! Love the muscles and Brooklyn pizza! It just changed ownership and is so hands on! Happy to have a great place to have a nice glass of wine locally! My new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"Great food - Great owners

The Muscles are amazing!!!!!!!!!!

Well done DeNora and Greg

We look forward to many years of amazing food and fun at your restaurant."}
{"text":"This particular place changed owners I believe. You can certainly tell the difference.  Inside does not have that cozy feel anymore, menu is limited compared to what it was.   Found their dishes to be disappointing (certainly not the homemade Italian quality we were looking for).  I miss the old place."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place for mother's day and have a feeling it will get even better.  The owners are clearly committed which is always good to see.  The pizza bread was amazing, the presentation was great. The mussels were spot on.  They only got better as they soaked in the goodness.  We only had pasta dishes which were great.  I can't comment on the pizza but what I saw looked excellent.  Can't wait to visit again and watch this place evolve."}
{"text":"Great location, used to be where a wonderful Italian restaurant used to be. Food is fair at best, service definitely needs improvement and radio station changes every few minutes to include rap music. Owner super nice but female waiter needs some personality."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a family dinner and tried the Brooklyn pizzas. They were great. Thin crust , good sauce and plenty of cheese . The other one was full of meatballs sliced. A new family favorite. Thanks again DeNoRa for a great tasting meal."}
{"text":"This was my family's and my first time dining here. We purchased a Groupon and went there the same day.
The restaurant is small, intimate and cozy. The owner recently bought the restaurant and renamed it. It is family owned and operated. 
We enjoyed our time eating a wonderful family dinner there. The service was great and personable. The food delicious and fresh, some of the best ever in Phoenix. This restaurant is a step ahead of all the other Italian restaurants and a hidden gem that Guy Fieri needs to come check out from the Food Network channel. 
My daughter ordered Chicken Marsala because it's gluten free, prepared and cooked in a separate area. For my sons we ordered a cheese pizza and my husband and I ordered the St James. The St James was loaded with beef sausage, meatballs, red pepper, white onion and mushrooms. 
The chicken Marsala was topped with capers, mushrooms, onions, sun dried tomatoes, and artichoke. 
We found a good restaurant in which we will return to in the near future. I highly recommend everyone give this restaurant a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We ordered the Long Island Grandma and it was excellent! My daughter proclaimed \"This is my new favorite pizza!\" We need to try more items but our first experience was bang on!"}
{"text":"Great rotating menu and very reasonable.  Great service. The place is nice and intimate."}
{"text":"Happy to have a new Italian restaurant in the neighborhood.  Went for dinner on Sunday.  Quiet in the restaurant but friendly, efficient service.  Good pour on the wine.  Burratta salad was excellent - great garlic bread to accompany.  Sausage/rigatoni entr√©e also very good.  Great ratio of tasty sausage to perfectly cooked pasta not drowning in sauce.  A few minor tweaks to the entire meal would make it perfect and the owner was happy to take the feedback.  I'll be interested to try it again in the future."}
{"text":"Always amazing food and service! Denora and Greg are great. Highly recommend De's Shrimp as an appetizer and the chicken Marsala and pizza is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I have been remiss in not writing a review. This is my go-to place when I need to get away and have some great food in a nice relaxing atmosphere. Great food at a great price with great service. What more can you ask for?

This was formerly Crust and in my opinion, this is a great Step Up. :-) you can tell the food is prepared with lots of care and love. I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Best neighborhood Italian restaurant.  The new ownership has amped up the quality of the food and the service is friendly and attentive.  I felt like I was having dinner with family (the ones I like). Great food and vibes.  Happy hour is an awesome deal as well.  Thanks Denora!"}
{"text":"Delicious, I had the shrimp tortellini on special and it was ginormous! So much sauce as I'm not used to as I usually have to ask for extra..My hubby had the ravioli of the day and that was also on point, all homemade. We also ordered the Margarita Pizza just to try, and it was pretty tasty.. I'm from back east and I'm Italian so I know good Italian when I find it!  This is a little gem! I went tonight to 'venture of out the box' because Anthony Bourdain died today who I greatly respected and admired. Trust me, you won't regret trying this place. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Have been a regular here for years and glad to see DeNora & Greg get a shot. We've been twice since they took over and the food and service has only gotten better!!! We are really happy with the menu and as always DeNora makes us feel like family and the food is awesome!!! Highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic!  The beer is cold and the service is great!!  We also order some of the pasta.......OMG.... so good!!"}
{"text":"Just loaded up my whole family to come try this place today after reading all these great reviews - pretty disappointed to find out it's closed for the month when we arrived. It would have been nice to see that on a website or something. Everything I see says it's open today from 3-9pm."}
{"text":"I used to come here when it was Crust. I thought It was good then, I think it's better now! I love the staff and love the food! I had the Brooklyn pizza and the spaghetti meatballs! Yummy"}
{"text":"This place is soooooooo great!! DeNora and Greg and the entire staff are so hospitable. Food is absolutely amazing. You have to have the mussels!! I personally recommend this to all my friends and bring my family here every chance I get. Also - fantastic happy hour special: $20 bottle of wine and a pie!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!!!
Delicious food. Great sevice.
Stopped for our last dinner before flying back to Cincinnati. What a great find."}
{"text":"The Food was amazing ! Some of the best ingredients true Italian food ! The owners are very warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant. The meatballs with the red sauce over pasta is delicious. Their red sauce is light and taste like they made it the same day.

We also had the chicken Parmesan.  It had four pieces of chicken and it was enough to feed more than one person. I ended up taking most of it home.  

I'll be back in a couple weeks to try their homemade pizza."}
{"text":"We stopped in to see what changes the new owners are making.  All to the good.  Friendly, family owned Italian Resultant.  All the items on the menu were favorites of mine and the IPA came out cold.   We tried meatballs and spaghetti (took another night's worth home) and  Fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken.  Both were excellent, but the Alfredo was one of the best I have ever had.  Along with the good service, and realistic prices, one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"This place is a small neighborhood restaurant but clean with good food, service, prices, authenticity and my favorite?  Red wine served at the right temperature!  Ambience is intimate and there is a bar.  Will return."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent atmosphere!  I have been trying new things and they are always so tasty!!  I look forward to running into Denora and Greg as they are most amazing hosts!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"DeNora's food is amazing with even better service! The owners Greg and DeNora made our experience so personable! DeNora offered us a taste of her favorite wine and Greg even brought out some of their famous garlic knots to sample. They sat near our table and talked to us about their family, wine, and the best dishes on the menu. We ordered the Nona's pasta with fresh burrata, spaghetti with meatballs, and the 6 boroughs pizza. Food was fantastic!! The restaurant is quaint and charming with a great local/neighborhood feel. TRUST ME...This place is worth making a trip to!"}
