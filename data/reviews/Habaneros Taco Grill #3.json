{"text":"Pretty much just a nicer less sketchy Roberto's. The food and service are good. Long wait during lunch though."}
{"text":"I have been counting down the days until this new Mexican restaurant opened in my 'hood. As soon as I read that it opened, I made the trip in. 

The service is really great. The staff have been well-trained. They're kind and incredibly fast. My food for 4 was ready within 6 minutes. 

The salsa bar is perfect. There is a smoky option, a citrus-focused option, and a spicy option. I really enjoyed the spicy green salsa. 

As for the food, it was decent. I can't say I was blown away. The quesadilla needed a lot more cheese, and the carne asada needed seasoning. I would eat it again, but it would not be my first choice. Same with the carne asada fries. 

This could be a really great place if they make a few tweaks."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this to open, and although this is our first time coming we love it! It's a great addition to this neighborhood. The staff were all extremely friendly, and the prices were very reasonable. The food was great, I definitely recommend this taco grill!!"}
{"text":"Called in a pick up order. Food was hot and fresh when we picked it up. Must try the Nevada burrito with carne asada."}
{"text":"It was my 1st visit, the food was decent. They have a very extensive menu; I selected the Taco Salad and fries. This place reminds me of Roberto's. . .not a bad experience just not enough wow! I was expecting more spice and seasonings, hence the name Habanernos. Slightly disappointed, maybe you have to request spicy items. However,  I will say, as a bonus; an order of fries is enough for at least 3 people! You definitely get your money's worth for the portion sizes, I am stuffed!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. Do yourself a favor and drive down the street to Roberto's. They have better quality food at a lower price.

I ordered a breakfast burrito and asked to add avocado. They charged me for it but only gave me a thin slice of avocado. The breakfast burrito itself was put together pretty lazily, but more importantly tasted awful."}
{"text":"Really good food. I had the Ground beef chimichanga and it was very flavorful. Awesome customer service as well."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I'm eating at the same place as the rest of these yelp reviews, because the food sucks.

People are friendly enough but the quality of the food is less than desirable. 

This is my second time trying them out after a long awaited opening. My first order was for a Carnitas Torta. The carnitas has zero seasoning and the bread base was literally soaked in liquid (I'm assuming juice from the meat) and soggy falling apart. How you can even call that a Torta is beyond me.

My second visit today the food was just as terrible. Ordered the Chili Rellenos/Cheese Enchilada combo plate. The breading on the CR was spongy and had a slight bite to it, the chili and cheese inside were molten hot, like this was not a freshly made item but something that had been cooked up a day ago and popped in the microwave. Then you get the enchilada which was a plain corn tortilla stuffed with un-melted cheddar cheese. This was all drenched in what tasted like a canned red sauce, topped with cheese and lettuce (which wilted from the heat of the food). 

I was so looking forward to a qsr mexican restaurant in the area, but I was disappointed to get something with such horrible food quality.

After these two experiences I'd rather go to Taco Bell before I'd venture back here."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and excellent fast service! This is authentic food at a great price with lots of choices"}
{"text":"Move over Roberto's!  Habaneros got me like oh emmm for their carniasada nachos!  Roberto's use to be my go to after a late night of drinking.  I always hated all the grease that came with it.  But habaneros not at all greasy!!! The chips has that perfect crunch!  The meats and fillings is super generous!  This could feed like 3-4 people.  But tonight,  it's allllllll mine muahahahahahaha LoL"}
{"text":"I ordered via UBER Eats. Got the Enchilada Plate. The sauce on the Cheese Enchilada was not the best. The Mexican Rice was Ok, but I'm am spoiled having grown up with Authentic Mexican Rice made by my Aunt.

The Carne Asada Taco's were VERY GOOD. I would definitely order them again.
Really deserves Two and a Half Stars.
I would order again ONLY for the Delicious Carne Asada Taco."}
{"text":"Staying here at a nearby hotel. Great fast breakfast stop. Very clean and has a salsa bar. Got a plate of eggs, pico, and guac."}
{"text":"Greatly appreciate the courtesy and light hearted attitude of the cashier. Dealing with a new menu is not easy as a customer. Patience is definitely needed, along with suggestions from someone familiar (ie. the cashier). Colorful and very pictorial field menus make selection of lunch (breakfast options too) options easy. No guessing is needed, unlike some restaurants in the city where the names are not recognizable. Leaving you wishing the whole time if you could ask Alexa \"what does this mean\"? Selected the green chicken chili fries, but only because the cashier sold me on the juices from the green chicken chili sealing into the fries. Her recommendation was valid, and on the fries where there wasn't a mountain of cheese, sour cream, onions, cilantro, and green chicken chili, the juices helped to prevent a mouth full of dry potatoes. The menu and food combinations is so plentiful, I can see spending multiple lunch ones here within the next couple months and never have the same thing twice."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night and got the Tuesday special, chicken tacos. The shells were a little too crispy, but it wasn't terrible. I do like that the restaurant was clean and the cashier spoke immediately upon entering; I'll give them a second chance."}
{"text":"I went in, ordered two tacos without guacamole and waited. I got the tacos in good time and they had guacamole on them. I took them back up and was told they would make me a new order. I sat and watched as order after order that arrived after me was completed. If they don't care, my money doesn't spend there. I got a refund and left."}
{"text":"I remember going to this place when it was Spicy Pickle.  We didn't know it changed to a taco shop, but decided to give it a try.  Ordered a Las Vegas burrito.  It is your standard \"California burrito\" at most other locations.  The burrito was good, pretty much what I expected.  A big burrito filled with meat, fries, cheese, and pico.  Prices are reasonable and portions are filling.  You get good value for your money.  Only complaint was it took a while to get our food.  The lunch rush is pretty brutal and the kitchen isn't really able to handle a lunch rush.  I'd recommend coming early or late and avoiding the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I had been waiting for this place to open.  So I'm trying to watch my figure these days, but I still wanted to try a something.  So today was Monday.  They had ground beef taco's for $1.00 Perfect!  I was going to just get 1 but I decided to get 2.  So while I was waiting for my order, I went over to the salsa bar.  I don't care for the carrots they have, they seem to be soggy, or not raw and marinated.  I like mine raw and marinated.  The Jalapeno's were ok, but......after I put that hot salsa on my taco, (Yes I choose the hot one) Jalapeno's weren't needed!  These taco's were so good!  The meat was seasoned to perfection.  I pushed the other 2 sauces to the side!  But let me tell ya'll!  My mouth was burning for the next 20 min.  It was hot while I was eating it, but once I was done, it seemed like it was getting hotter! and hotter!  I was whistling inward to try and cool off my mouth!  I was drinking ice cold water to try and cool down my mouth!  Even though it was that hot, it was really good!  I would choose that sauce again."}
{"text":"We ordered two burritos, two enchiladas, a taco, and chips and cheese. The California burrito and chicken enchiladas were very good. However, that's where the compliment stops. The chips and cheese were ridiculous. I could have saved money by making my own nachos, then at least I'd have enough cheese. The beef taco was inedible. Overall, not a restaurant we'd try again."}
{"text":"Delivery was super fast.

Smothered french fries were great......so was the Adobada burrito.

Only let-down was I ordered hard shell tacos and the shells were kinda mushy instead of hard.....still tasty though."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait for this place to open and see what the food was like. The name in itself had me anticipating their opening. To my greatest delight the food was great, fresh a complete bang for your taste buds. Friendly staff and great music. Absolutely love this place will make this my go to spot for lunch. Keep up the great service guys. On the corner if Warm Springs and Amigo."}
{"text":"Muy bueno!! (Probably spelled that wrong, I don't speak Spanish). First time here, food was very good and came out fast which is a plus cuz I only have a half out break. Cashier smiled and was very nice(even complimented my nails). Dining room is bright and clean. Prices are excellent!"}
{"text":"Plenty of menu options, decent portions, just not much flavor. Got the rolled tacos combo, tasted decent, chicken was nondescript. Carrots on the salsa bar were mushy, but the salsa verde had good heat. Cashier was friendly and smiling. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but for the area not a bad option."}
{"text":"Hooray for this place finally opening today. It's nice to have a new lunch spot within walking distance of work.

The space is very similar to the previous tenant, so I'm not sure what took them so long. The interior is spacious with plenty of seating.

After a quick scan of their large menu, I went with the Green Chile Fries, which I guess I enjoyed since I ate the whole damn thing. I look forward to trying more of their menu in the coming weeks. Hopefully they stick around for a while.

EDIT: Quick update having visited a couple of times now. My rating should really be a 3. The food is decent. Nothing spectacular, but quick and friendly service and still a convenient work lunch option."}
{"text":"A Tuesday luncheon special of $1 chicken tacos was enough of an incentive for us to dine at this restaurant.  We were expecting street tacos for that price, but what we got was a fried taco shell that included flavorless chicken, iceberg lettuce and crumbled yellow cheese.  The salsas were thin and not particularly good.  There are 2 other Las Vegas locations plus the original in Reno that we will not be visiting."}
{"text":"The place was super busy even though the reviews where average. The door was broken and the wind would take it and slam into the glass. This happened a bunch of times until someone finally put something between the glass and door so the glass wouldn't eventually end up in a million pieces. My friend and I ordered separately. My chile relleno and taco plate took a while, but her breakfast burrito came at least 15 minutes after mine. My taco was pretty greasy, but tasted okay. My chile relleno was still cold inside where the cheese was still a solid slice. The beans and the rice on the side was good. The salsa bar had fresh radishes which I love, but the pickled carrot/jalapeno mixture used cooked carrots which were no longer crunchy. Maybe because it was busy, the place was not cleaned up and people left messes on the tables that no one cleaned. When exiting, they only use one of the doors so now you get to manuever between the line and the glass wall trying to get out where people are coming in for the mad dash at lunch. Sadly we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Move over Roberto's! There's a new $1 Chicken Taco in town."}
{"text":"Got the burrito,meat was bland.
Torta was average 
Customer service below average.
Couldn't get the order right.
Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Lucy is so great.   Every time I come she makes me laugh and always gets me to try new things. I am so happy this place opened so close to my house.   Even my mom is now obsessed with this place.  Lucy just told me I missed her by like 30 min."}
{"text":"The burritos are to die for!!! This place is soooo good that there lunch line is usually 8 people deep, lol, maybe I shouldn't say that but it's true! If you're short on time, come for dinner or take an hour lunch, believe me, you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. I work graveyard shift and thought I would give them a try since they are close and were \"still open\" at 11:15pm.  Well drove over (only a block) and they were closed despite their website stating that they are open late. Guess they lost a customer that never was. Update your site with the correct information!!!!"}
