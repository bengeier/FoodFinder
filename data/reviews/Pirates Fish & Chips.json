{"text":"Places like this should just close down. Horrible food...horrible service...the employee complained because I didn't call in my order for 2 crappy meals. You're better off taking the bun off a fish filet from mcdonalds and eating it with ketchup...nuff said."}
{"text":"If Pirates took over your school cafeteria and gave you a choice to walk the plank or eat their fish & chips, better put on your swim trunks and practice your backstroke.  This was the worst excuse for food I have had in a long time. The fish was square frozen patties that didn't even have a Mrs. Smiths nostalgic taste to them. Instead it reminded me of the movie Soylent Green where the people ate the equivalent of vitamin and protein filled Power Bars. No flavor, no texture, just something to eat because there wasn't anything else. Even their special Pirate Dipping Sauce can only be described as \"red.\"  It's not the end of the world yet, and there are a lot of better tasting things out there to spend your $5 on."}
{"text":"I am in total agreement with Lily A.  This was one of the worst meals we have ever had.  An article in the AZ Republic quoted the owner as saying that this \"food goes down pretty well with the university crowd.\"  God...I hope they spend their money on beer instead.  I think even grade school cafeterias don't serve this kind of dreck anymore. The fomerly frozen, poured-out-of-a-giant-bag fish was about 1/4\" thick and tasteless.  They charge $1.55 for an extra piece.  It's worth maybe 50 cents if you happen to find 2 quarters in your car's ashtray.The small handful of fries was cold, limp and shriveled--maybe the owner can invest in a heat lamp with all the money he is saving on buying cheap, glorified fish sticks. And they charge extra for tartar sauce.  The meal came with 2 red mystery sauces that remained unopened and were dumped in the garbage.  How about giving the customer a choice of 1 sauce and not charging them for it? Decor was drab, tables were dirty and there was food stuck in the cushions of the booth along the wall. Yuk!! I live in the neighborhood and I say never again!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to stop by one of these since I got here, in spite of the fact that they are a fast food chain.  The reason is because I remembered how good their oysters were.  I decided to get the 7 piece fried oysters and chips meal instead of just the 4 piece.  It was a whopping $4.50.  It was 50 cents extra for a 5 oz tarter sauce.  The oysters were as good as I remembered and I was glad I stopped.  The fries were a bit salty but still better than a lot of places.  I will definitely keep this on my must visit when in Arizona list. Menu @ http://www.piratesfishandchips.com/ (4/23/09)"}
{"text":"I can't say if Pirate's Fish and Chips was good or bad because it was so unforgettable which to me means it must not have been very good. I never forget a tasty fried food. I went there a while ago and was just not that impressed.  It was okay but no better than Long John Silver's, which isn't saying much."}
{"text":"Ugh. It's just not very good and the service is lacking.  Go a little further to Pete's Fish & Chips. It is worth it."}
{"text":"Food is absolute garbage. Came out stale and cold. A completely unsuccessful rip-off of Pete's."}
