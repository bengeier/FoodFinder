{"text":"We just had drinks here and watched a game- great service and they even made sure we had the game we wanted showing on TV (really went out of their way).  Reasonably priced drinks."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here for a beer and some lunch.  The atmosphere is friendly and the servers are all really nice.  TONS of beers on tap, and they have a good veggie burger.  Clam chowder is good but i'm not sure if it should be as famous as they claim it is.  Still, a comfortable and reasonable place to go for something to eat and some beers."}
{"text":"As much as I like being out on a patio why go here is beyond me...the service is snobby, really slow and the food is beyond humdrum. The servers have SUCH an attitude!"}
{"text":"I've been here for watch the game France vs Sweden on a TV.
There are two screens which another TV showed the game England vs Ukraine.

Those customers who England supporter were more than France&Sweden's so TV was Mute showing for France vs Sweden game.

I was with my friend,We ordered 2 different plates and wanted to shear these.We asked a server for cut in the middle for each.He served friendly but keeping politely.

My mind was with game so I forgot take meals pictures.I remembered those first name that were KIWI... and Montreal... .I prefer second meal was lighter and easier to eat.Both tastes good! 
I'd like to come back Hemingway's again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for somewhere cheap and casual in the yorkville area, and you don't care if the staff treat you like crap, then Hemingways is perfect for you! Don't expect the same kind of service/quality you will get in most Yorkville restaurants. The food is edible if you're drunk, and the drinks are alright. DO NOT order the chicken fajitas- they are absolutely disgusting. I would recommend the popcorn shrimp and nachos, the only two things I know won't disappoint. The service is sometimes decent although I had a less than pleasant experience with once of their servers recently. I had to send back my meal 3 times because the waitress could not get my order right, which caused a 40 min delay on a burger and salad. Our waitress had serious attitude and sarcasm  and did not even thank us after spending $110! Complained to the manager and he was worse than the server. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Sunday for lunch. The staff was super nice when walking in. We sat on the rooftop patio which is wicked. Excellent choice on a beautiful summer afternoon. I got the traditional club sandwich. It was good and the fries are banging. They have something like 24 beers on tap..something like that. 

It's not by any means an extravagant place, just a local bar/pub but I have to give it 5 stars. Very nice atmosphere, good prices and good food."}
{"text":"Great spot to go for a drink with the boys! The food was amazing, and the service was as great as the atmosphere. I'd highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The covered heated upstairs patio is amazing and in the summer it is even better. The staff are extremely nice and helpful. The have a great assortment of dishes on their menu but the wait time for food could be better. Overall it's a decent spot for a quick lunch or drink."}
{"text":"Located in Yorkville, surprisingly this joint has adequate prices (for the neighbourhood) and overall excellent quality of food. Granted, I only had fish and chips and that did it for me, but wouldn't be surprised to know that other dishes have merit. Some rare brews on tap add to a friendly and cozy environment and if you find yourself wondering around on Bloor on a cold winter's day, don't hesitate to check in and tuck yourself in a dark corner of this place. You'll get a piece of mind. I went there on a date myself around Christmas time and chances are will go back during the summer to check out the patio."}
{"text":"Two words: Eggs Benedict. They do a great job on the brunch. 

Hemingway's has been known for generations as an after work spot for young Bay St. types and kids who grew up in North Toronto. It was also the place you went when you finally turned of age when I was in high school.

It's usually rammed with people for after work drinks, not so busy late night and they have a covered, heated patio that's open year round."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with rooftop bar. Reasonably priced and good service. They even gave away free ciders!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and wanted lunch so we stopped here. Typical pub atmosphere. Our server was sweet and attentive. The corseted bartender chick was annoying and insisted that everyone in the bar here the unfiltered  conversation she was having with her colleagues. Think Torontonian valley girl. STFU already.

The split pea and ham soup was ham broth with a smattering of pea and ham, not the thick deliciousness one would expect. Interesting plum sauce served with my chix fingers.

The heated outdoor seating looked nice, though we did not partake.

Overall, just a \"meh\" experience. There are much better pubs in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is a fun pub for drinks. As a restaurant it's a disaster. The seats are very uncomfortable. The food was horrible. The salmon fillet was burnt, extremely dry and tasted awful. The rice was and veg were unseasoned. The whole dish was a complete disappointment. I returned my dish mostly uneaten (minus the vegetables) and paid my bill in full. I will not be returning. My family managed to finished their meals but were very underwhelmed. The service was quick, and our waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"Ugh.  Terrible service (our waitress dropped our menus on the table while carrying on a conversation with the people at the next table) and the food was awful.  The pizza tasted like something out of a box, and we couldn't bring ourselves to finish the sticky toffee pudding--and it was the dessert our waitress had recommended! I don't want to imagine what the less-favored options taste like.

I hear there are lots of attractive people here during happy hour, so maybe that's what keeps bringing people in the door, but we didn't have any such luck the night we went."}
{"text":"Dissatisfied with the Cumberland Mojito. It's described as having brown sugar and simple syrup; but the drink is tart! It's just not a good mojito :(

Not worth the $9.51 plus tax."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I sometimes wonder why I ever decided to come back here. The food is alright, the service is snobby and slow sometimes, the patio is nice but nothing great, this place can be crowded at times, and there is nothing special about the d√©cor either. The prices are okay and the food portions are good. However, their drinks: cocktails, wine, beer etc are overpriced. 

I don't think I'll be back here again."}
{"text":"The waitress, Victoria, was extremely affectionate and was touching me and my date way too much, sometimes both of us at the same time with her both hands.  We had a good laugh about it, but still felt a bit violated.  Weird.  Oh, and she also wrote XOXOXO on the check!"}
{"text":"There's nothing wrong with Hemingway's, but there's nothing special either. 

I'm mostly just disappointed that it claims to be New Zealander, but doesn't have a single NZ or Aussie beer on the menu. Seriously."}
{"text":"Don't order the butter chicken if you love butter chicken. It is ginger chicken and very disappointing if you enjoy Indian food!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Ordered drinks and food. Our server forgot to place our order on so we didn't get our meal until over an hour later. He didn't once check up on us and it was difficult to flag him down. The sangria is really watered down and taste like fruit juice. Half the pitcher is ice. We let the manager know and he proudly told us it was their best seller and is pre-mixed. They only add fruit. The service wasn't improved after we complained either. Disappointing. Won't return."}
{"text":"Amazing local bar with great selection of beer and an amazing patio. Cool place for the summer!"}
{"text":"Generally speaking this place is halfway decent.. However rude bouncers and management make me not want to return."}
{"text":"Hemingway's was our destination for some after work drinks, and before dinner drinks.  That works right?   A friend and I split a pitcher and shared some fries.  The service was friendly and quite quick.  I loved how busy the patio was with people still in their work clothes, just relaxing on a nice warm summer evening.  It was surprising how despite how busy they were, it wasn't that hard to get a table for 2, and how fast the service was.  Our waiter was quick with the upsells, and managed to get us to upgrade our pitcher of beer, but not so with the fries.  We stuck with the classics.  Had a great time, and would go back."}
{"text":"Booo!!  What used to be a decent, affordable bar in Yorkville is no longer an option for me.  I would go to Hemingways to meet up with fellow cigar smokers after a longday's work.  They no longer allow cigars but it seems they're OK with cigarettes. It's a shame.  Us cigar smokers kept their patio alive during the colder months.   The staff are pretty cool though.  But I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came by here today to just sit in the patio and have some espresso (which is pretty much the only thing in Yorkville we could afford)

It probably seems silly to just focus on espresso in what is a sports bar type place, but it was just delicious! Very sweet with a prominent woody taste. I don't think I've ever had an espresso with as many flavours going on. I'd recommend any coffee nerds/snobs swing by here to try it.

Their desserts looked delicious and the smell of the burgers on offer were definitely tempting. 

The inside was a standard bar/pub layout, different from the fancy glamorous establishments nearby, and the three levels of patio seating looked fantastic - I'd say this place is great fun for a night out.

The staff were absolutely lovely and very genuine. Felt sorry for one of them who got stuck dealing with a flashy Yorkville millionaire type"}
{"text":"Nice location in the heart of Yorkville and a rooftop patio is the only good thing going for Hemingways. The decor inside is a hodgepodge of artifacts & memorabilias. Has the usual array of beer on tap, house wine, and some mediocre wine. 
A great pub for drinks but do not under any circumstance order food from any of the several menus available. 
I ordered the margherita pizza that tasted worse than a frozen pizza. 
The staff, however, are friendly and does their job well."}
{"text":"The food is not the best; but it has an awesome roof top and patio for the summer. Even heaters for those cold winter days.  But overall good bar for a few drinks."}
{"text":"One of my favourite watering holes and interesting crowd especially late in the evenings . It's the most random mix mash of people you'll likely ever find and it's probably one of the few places that I feel like I'm not severely judged for going solo for a pint. 

They recently changed up the menu.. most of the items are the same but they got rid of the veggie platter which being Yorkville..  you would think they would have more healthier options for those who are watching their waistline. The majority of the food is palatable only.. but who's eating anyways?!"}
{"text":"Among Hemingway's, Remy's, and the Pilot, Hemingway's is the weak link. Wouldn't really go here for food. They have an eclectic menu, which it supposedly reflective of New Zealand. I guess I kind of get what they're saying (diverse sources of influence on the cuisine), but it's not exactly promising when jambalaya, butter chicken, fajitas, and pad thai are all on the menu. To no surprise, the food is mediocore.

If you're just going for drinks, it's not bad. Prices are fair for Yorkville. Can be difficult to get a table in the evening, and late enough, can be difficult to get in at all. This place draws a huge crowd. Once it gets busy, the service gets slow as well. 

Okay place if you're going for drinks and manage to get a table. There's better alternatives, though."}
{"text":"Much like Remy's across the street, this is a place to go for the drinks rather than the food.   Good place to go with friends but usually pretty crowded any day of the week throughout the summer."}
{"text":"2nd year in a row I have travelled across the city to avail of the fact that they do US Thanksgiving dinner at Hemingways, only to be disappointed yet again. Last year, they had run out of some bits and pieces of the turkey dinner by 7:30ish, but could just about manage some turkey, this year despite the fact I had made reservations at about 8:30 that morning and arrive 15 mins early, we sat for 20 mins or more before our server took our order, only the have him come back 2 mins later and tell us that they had completely run out of the turkey dinners! Won't bother next year - The Blake House has guaranteed Us Thanksgiving dinners all weekend round and is a nicer setting anyway."}
{"text":"I had a burrito here and it wasn't very good. I was there with three girlfriends and none of us like what we ordered. They seemed to depend a lot on melted cheese to try to make the food good and it didn't work. Fish tacos with melted cheese? No thanks. This food is very expensive considering that it is such poor quality."}
{"text":"Only thing great is the calamari and whatever beer they have on tap"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by Hemingway's. They have a great rooftop patio located in a trendy Yorkville area. 

For the location I thought the price was extremely reasonable. The food is quite common pub fare but everyone at my table was satisfied. I had the fish tacos and fries which I was impressed with. I would visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"After leaving (thank GOODNESS) SNOBVILLE across the street where 1 glass of wine was the cost of a BOTTLE here, (do NOT got to One Restaurant - tinis $20, 1 glass of wine was $56 - yes a GLASS).

Not exactly my speed, {a bit run down}, BUT it was a much better option to visit here where everyone was having a fun time, outside, 2 levels of outdoor patio on a fabby summer evening.  All our dishes were good, so was our server, so overall, for the food and prices, it was a hit, and at least it wasn't out credit card that was!"}
{"text":"I find myself here 3 times in the past month - probably out of convenience of where it's located, the fun dive atmosphere in a ritzy part of town.  The food is decent and the beer is tasty.  I do like the patio - its nicely heated in the winter.  Not too loud, you can still have conversations here.

Also I left my credit card here and they held on to it for me!  Phew!  Thanks Hemingways.

Good place for drinks and convos, don't expect too much out of the food.  I've had the poutine, jerk chicken wrap, salad and it's palateable."}
{"text":"Very cool place. They have a large selection of beers. In my opinion, one of the best beer selections in the city (many of which are on tap). Food is pretty solid also. I would recommend the nachos. 

The servers are friendly, but the bouncers and bartenders can be a bit hostile. Me and my friends are in our early 20s and they always give us the stink eye at the door when getting in. 

Went there for my friends birthday and they ended up cutting him off. While he was well served, he definitely was not over served. We were a large group (20+) and brought a lot of business to the bar. Did not appreciate them cutting off my buddy on his birthday."}
{"text":"Hemmingways has been open forever. The old saying location, location, location is definitely true in this case. Located in the heart of Yorkville it's an excellent bar with a convenient location right on the subway line. But like most places that location is there prime selling point the food here is average at best. I had the pizza and frankly I've had better frozen pizzas. On the positive side the service as always was great, and the beer cold. I'd definitely go back, maybe stop by McDonalds before I go in :)"}
{"text":"It was our first time in Canada and we decided to explore and walk around the city. We came upon this cool place by chance because the restaurant next door did not have any open tables. This place is four levels high including a popular patio. The food was great, I had their turkey burger and local Mill St. Organic beer. This occurred during the women's soccer world cup so they had the games on there numerous tv's. Great vibe and service, we returned one last time before leaving Toronto. Anyone thinking of visiting Toronto should stop by Hemingway's."}
{"text":"I was pretty happy with my experience. It's nice in the summer, decent food, nice patio.
Went on a Saturday night and it was pretty packed..provided it is st. patrick's day weekend, I'm not sure how it would be on other weekends. Regardless, we put our names on a waitlist upstairs and the gentleman came to find us once a spot opened up. That was pretty nice.
Drinks were cheap enough. Server was a little rude."}
{"text":"We went here as a group of 4 and had a great time on the rooftop heated balcony area.

To eat, we had nacho's and buffalo wings with hot sauce on the side. They were great and the beer complimented it well. The selection of beers on tap was good, I had the bone-shaker IPA.

Overall, a good spot to go out for pub type of food and have some drinks."}
{"text":"An incredible bar to grab some after work or late night drinks. They have possibly the best rooftop patio in the city which is open year round and covered and heated in the winter. It's a surprisingly low key place for being right in the heart of Yorkville and attracts a very interesting variety of people."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at the mediocre reviews on here, this is one of my favourite places in town. I've only been to the patio for drinks once, I'm not a big drinker or a fan of bars. Usually I spend my time downstairs in the dining room, which beautifully decorated in rich greens with a hand-painted mural of a prairie setting along one of the back walls. Service is consistently good, and they have the best fish and chips in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very busy and fun. The rooftop patio is amazing. I think they are a little understaffed sometimes.. 2 servers on a full patio is not enough. Food is good and big portion. Their menu really ranges. We got fish and chips and fish tacos. Both really good. Definitely recommend unless you are in a rush."}
{"text":"The beer on tap is never that cold. I first thought it was just the Guinness. Then I tried a few others during other visits and noticed the same thing. The only one I found that seemed as cold as it should be was Canadian."}
{"text":"Great little brunch spot. Nothing too fancy, but a good vibe and good, basic food. Would go back."}
{"text":"All the alcohol served is watered down!! Even scotch on the rocks is diluted. 
Ambience and food are good, but beware of drinks - this place is a rip off."}
{"text":"Came here for our usual Friday night weekly roundup of the crew to go over our work week and meet up. Normally by 10 they say that there isn't room for 7 but a couple went at 9 and managed to snag a table. We were on the third level patio, which was cramped with people however, not obtrusively so.

Some people ordered food at our table which no one seemed to complain about. Our waitress was quick and attentive and we had an overall good experience. For being in Yorkville I expected outrageous prices yet everything seemed to be par for the course in Toronto. 

Overall, I'd go again."}
{"text":"This place has a great reputation. In my opinion, it's a Jackastors in Yorkville. If you like Jackastors then you'll love Hemingways. I mean it's great but I never suggest to go here as an option and only go if my ALL my friends want to go."}
{"text":"Hemingway's is a fun, casual place that serves a decent drink without a lot of hassle.  And the fact that they allow cigar smoking out on their heated patio upstairs was an extra bonus for my cigar loving friends the other night.

It was Winter- yet the heaters kept us warm outside.  Surprising given I am not ever warm outside.  

Service was the only draw back but we solved that issue by going inside and getting our own drinks.

Think of it as your neighborhood pub but without the friendly service you might expect."}
{"text":"Despite my 2-star rating, I do love this place in the summer for drinks on the rooftop patio. Went on Sunday May 25. We had a jug of very refreshing sangria($20.35). It was almost 3 pm and neither of us had had lunch already. My friend had the Out of Bounds chicken salad($13.99): a grilled chicken breast laid on a bed of mixed greens, with sundried cranberries, spiced pecans, feta cheese, tossed in a raspberry vinaigrette. It looked fresh and tasty and, in her opinion, was exactly that, but nothing to write home about. I had the \"Bellair Omelet\"($9.99) which was a veggie and cheese omelette. While it was good, I thought it was just ok, a bit on the bland side. It came with  home fried potatoes that were tasty. i had specifically asked for no toast and when my plate arrived, it had an order of brown toast. I ate it. I like bread but the idea is to have as little as possible and I often skip it when out for brunch. In addition, the supposedly sauteed mushrooms I added for an extra .99 cents tasted and felt as if they came out of a can found at Metro, you know the one sitting next to the cans of creamed corn and green beans. Meh.

Service was very friendly and competent, despite the toast misunderstanding. You sit in one of the nicest bars and patios in Yorkville. However, if you spend $51.21 for brunch for 2 people, it needs a bit more kick and oomph in the food. My advice is go to Hemingway's for drinks and bar snacks, which I plan to do this summer. The brunch? Skip it. There are way better options nearby."}
{"text":"WOWWWWWW! this place gets busy like jack the bear! A nice location in Yorkville with a rooftop patio

Make sure to get early to secure a patio spot in the summer but if you don't like busy places this is not for you. The servers are great and friendly and the food is not bad at all."}
{"text":"This place is decent, but for some reason I can't give it less than five stars. It's comfortable, easy and inexpensive. Need I say  more?

Actually, yes: the patio is pretty dope."}
{"text":"Fat cat not like cults.. So FatCat get very suspicious when he see many people doing similar things at same time, without good reason.. 

Example..  This winter FatCat notice many people wearing jacket called Canada Goose. FatCat not know why. Something fishy going on.  FatCat starting investigation to try to get to bottom of this very soon.. FatCat keep you posted if he discover something sinister..  FatCat notice this especially at trendy/pretentious neighbourhoods like Yorkville - place of Hemmingways. 

Things FatCat like
 - Amazing patio - summer or winter.
 - FatCat eat before but not remember quality of food. Stay tuned. FatCat might update on food later.

Things FatCat not like
 - Sometimes waitresses too snobby - but not always.
 - Not like crowd too much.  FatCat walk out of bar sometimes feeling like he need shower from being around slippery people. Maybe FatCat always go when  after work crowd is there? Not sure.
 - Too many posers in neighborhood just driving around block endlessly in expensive cars. One time FatCat sit outside of bar for one hour to count how many times same expensive car will drive past FatCat.  FatCat lose count. FatCat know..  not Hemmingway fault. But give you idea of kind of people in hood.

SIDE STORY:  FatCat have similar suspicion about another cult few years ago when FatCat see many ladies dressing up feet to look like llama feet (FatCat find out later that ladies wearing boots called uggs - funny name.. Maybe short form for Ugg-leees?  FatCat not want to offend anyone so he not speculate too much)

FatCat get to bottom of llama foot trend and conclude that ladies wearing llama feet not in cult. They just not care about looking good anymore.  Phew!!  No cult that time..  FatCat rest easy.

But FatCat not trust Canada Goose trend.. Not worry yelpers... FatCat investigate and let you know if danger..

UPDATE: FatCat finish investigation of Canada Goose. See bar volo review for FatCat's analysis and conclusion."}
{"text":"A great crowd for after work drinks on the rooftop patio. Good selection of beers and not too pricy (esp for Yorkville). The samosas and curry is recommended in my books -- but to think of it there's nothing I think I've had there that I haven't enjoyed.  The service can be a little hit or miss here - I've had some really great servers and some that leave a little to be desired.

But all in all I will always say yes if someone asks me to go for drinks here..."}
{"text":"A+ for atmosphere & location -  and WHAT a patio!

We traveled to Hemingway's post drink at Bedford for... another drink. Considering it was packed, we had quick service and I can't complain about a pitcher or Rickard's white. They also have a bar menu that's available pretty late - all the usual suspects; potato skins, poutine, sharing platter, blah blah blah. 

It was definitely loud and crowded, but the patio is great (and sufficiently heated/covered in the winter), and there's a cool, energetic, vibe.  People seemed pretty relaxed.. or maybe that was the alcohol?

All in all, a great spot for a drink in Yorkville - more laid-back than other spots and definitely less expensive. If I could give it 4 1/2 stars, I would."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't order anything to eat here.  The food is barely average and the beer selection is your typical mainstream offerings.  This place serves pub food that's not too overpriced for the area.  The servers seem to have too many customers and end up running around too much so service is not a strong point either.  

This is an everybody spot with a big after work following. This is not a bad meeting spot for bigger groups but I wouldn't waste a full evening here.  Hemingway's actually used to attract a nicer crowd a few years ago but I'm not sure what happened. Right now, this is not the type of place I would frequent and would only come back if the choice wasn't mine.  Keep your expectations low if you decide to come here."}
{"text":"The service was a little slow, and the food was a mixed bag. My son really enjoyed the wings, and the burger got good reviews. The beet salad would have been better with candied pecans. In general, fried things (French fries, samosas, etc) seem to be the best bet."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch. Most recently, I had the Kiwi lamb burger/side salad. This place is more about atmosphere and location (and cold beer) over the food, which is just okay."}
{"text":"This is the most pretentious resturant I've ever been to in my whole fucking life.

So we went to see and be seen, as that is what you do in Yorkville (really, thats it...) and the female front staff here are some of the worst people I have ever met in Toronto.
Here's whats wrong with the place...


the 1st issue...
So the hostess would not seat us in the trendy up top patio, neither or deck patio, so she puts us in the corner where nobody can see us.

the 2nd issue... Gold digging staff...
Then a waitress on purpose orders wrong meals for us... we ordered a salad with no cranberries, and she on purpose left them in. And a chicken parmesan.
So after half an hour she brings us a salad WITH cranberries and get this... the \"chicken parmesan\" (if you even wanna call it that) was this... the pasta was fettucini alfredo (cream sauce and all) with the actual seasoned chicken with the red pasta sauce on top of the pasta WHICH DOSEN'T EVEN GO WITH IT!  It soooooo done on purpose.
This waitress was a bitch from hell. She didnt come to ask how how we were doing even once during the whole meal. She was there trying to solicit the rich single men at the bar with her cheap Lindsay Lohan 6126 leggings the whole time, stupid hussy.

I've never, in my whole life, been treated so bad by wait staff at a resturant, EVER.
Maybe the waitress became the inspiration for the movie Chloe, perhaps?"}
{"text":"Great Rooftop patio bar/restaurant!  They also have a cozy indoor seating area downstairs.  Staff is super friendly and fun, good is simple and yummy and it's a great place to check out during the Toronto Film Festival!"}
{"text":"Le Hemingway c'est un peu le bar resto o√π se croisent touristes, jeune hipsters et bobo torontois. J'y vais pour leur superbe terrasse couverte avec chauffage lampadaire en hiver. Grand choix de bi√®res et restauration typique de bar. 
PS : ils servent des escargots √† la demi douzaine et ils sont d√©licieux!!!

Hemingway is that kind of bar where you can meet rich local people having a drink on a saturday night or just tourists passing by and resting from intensive shopping sessions at the bay. I come here for their gigantic patio with stand up heaters during the winter. 
They do have a great choice of beers, food is what you can find in any regular bar.
Tip : they do serve snails by hal a dozen and they are so yumyyyy!!!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and has 3 levels. Cute little outdoor seating and roof top area. Drinks were okay but i think they left half of my martini at the bar. Barely filled half way. Got a few apps that were pretty good. Staff/waitress, plain RUDE and Stuck up. Please don't be in the service industry if you don't know how to be friendly or even pretend to enjoy what YOU decided to do for work. Waitress didn't even thank us after we still gave her a little over 20% tip and pointed that out to her and said you're welcome. Probably embarassed, she eventually came over to thank us. Would probably go back and just get drinks at the bar next time to avoid waitress staff."}
{"text":"I love going to Hemmingway's. I've been there countless times, the food is always good there, the service is mixed but generally have been nice and courteous. I love their fries (both regular and sweet potato), calamari and brunch. It can get busy if you go during peak hours, which might not be worth the wait.  If you are looking for a good place to grab drinks with friends, there aren't many in the Bay/Bloor area (let alone Yorkville), I recommend checking Hemingway's out."}
{"text":"Chicken, Brie sandwhich was decent. The place has a very casual vibe. Good place to have a drink or two if you want to catchup with friends. Rooftop is really nice (that may be the core attraction). Service  is a hit or miss."}
{"text":"Basically: I was wrong. 

I had this preconceived notion that Hemingway's was for the uppity, or those feigning that they belonged in Yorkville's supposed debonair setting. I imagined schmoozy - \"do you come here often\" - mingling along the space between the backlit bar and single, wall-lining leather banquette.

Boy, was I wrong.
The crowd at Hemingway's is actually low-key, and comfortably in the company of friends. Conversations across the patio appeared to be intimate and concentrated around tables on the roof-top, lit by the moon, votives, and a few strings of christmas (?) lights. 
The venue itself is also casual. If there were drunken chaos, the second floor patio treehouse could be mistaken for a grown-up version of \"The Maddy\". Yet, there's a quiet murmur.

That's all I can report on as I too was entrenched in some casual and comfy convo.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Paul was amazing! Service was incredible, his recommendations were on point! He made our first experience at Hemmingways exceptional! TFC Champs 2017! Cheers. Thanks again for a fun filled Saturday!"}
{"text":"High expectations, massive disappointment. C'mon it's Yorkville. Atmosphere was great, nice patios all levels. I got some pasta that looked terrible, felt like they threw something together quick time since it took so long. Guess it was party my fault, if I truly wanted pasta, shoulda went next door to Dimmi..."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now, most recently on a Sunday afternoon and then on a Friday night. On the Sunday, I just got drinks and the service was great, very friendly but not overbearing. The next time I was there on Friday night a week or two later, of course it was busier so we had to wait. It was not too long of a wait (about 20-25 minutes) and they texted us to let us know our table was ready so we didn't have to stand around waiting which was nice. We ordered drinks and Cajun fries which had been recommended to me by two different people so I was expecting them to be really good. When they arrived, they were really not what I expected. Basically just seasoned fries with cheese melted on them. The fries were nice and crispy which was good but they had obviously been prepared and then sat around for a while because they were luke warm and the cheese was completely dried and resolidified.

Overall, not bad. If I went back, I would probably not order food at such a busy time again."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and was really impressed. The service was good and the patio was great. We sat on the second level outside in the sunshine and the menu had a few gluten and dairy free options. I ordered the Paella and it was fantastic!  It tasted amazing and was really filling. It was the perfect dinner for a hot night.

Hemmingway's is also a great venue in the winter. It's a bit more cosy but the drinks are always good. If you're in Yorkville and want to grab a drink or a bite to eat, this is a choice."}
{"text":"In an area filled with expensive restaurants and high end stores sits Hemingways, a casual four storey resto with enough patio space to handle pretty much any event. Whether it's celebrating a birthday or enjoying an after work drink, this place has you covered. 

They have a pretty extensive drink menu which includes beers, wines and cocktails has a little something for everyone - definitely would recommend their red wine sangria! It's the perfect refreshing drink to enjoy on one of their four patios. 

I don't have a bad thing to say about their food. Must try's are the lamb burger, calamari and quesadilla, but you really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. 

The place gets packed quickly with the after work crowd so be prepared to wait if you haven't made reservations. Get over there if you haven't been already and enjoy the summer on their patio with a sangria in your hand, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff & great location in the heart of Yorkville. Reasonably priced for the location and a wide range of beers on tap. Food isn't  bad either. Highly recommended & always buzzing."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype about this place.

Average to below average food, average service, average decor. 

Gross bathrooms that are upstairs.

I am always amazed when the Film Fest is on and you hear that celebs stop in here.  Really?!  Is this the best that they think Toronto has to offer?  I hope not."}
{"text":"I spent the evening at Hemingway's Restaurant with a group of friends. Right off the bat, let me say that this was primarily a casual night out with friends, with a fair amount of drinking, so I'll differ the food review until next time.
Hemingway's is a pretty cool pub, with several floors, and great staff. Our drink of choice for the night was Brickworks Cider. I love cider. The only thing that sullies my love affair with it is that you usually can only have one or two glasses before your mouth becomes a sticky, sugary mess. This is definitely not the case with Brickworks. I appreciate our bartender, Razeen, making the winner suggestion!
The only food that we had was an appetizer of calamari. It came with lemon, and two well pair sauces. One was a creamy tartar sauce, and the other may have been a salsa, but my memory is iffy here.

I could say a lot about the roof-top patio and the rest of the look of the place, but what pleased me the most were the overhead space heaters that they had all over the floor that I was on. I dare you to get some of that heat and a solid cider in you, and tell me that you're not comfortable!

I should also extend a big thanks to the staff, since in my less than careful state, I accidentally left my bag at our table when we left. I was easily able to retrieve it the next day, as they had stored it in their lost and found. God bless them."}
{"text":"Be careful if you are paying cash.  I was with 2 friends,we got a drink each and an appetizer.  We paid our bills in cash.  It was around $14, we all paid with $20.  We all ask for a dollar or two in chargeback .  The server comes back having broken each of our twenties into change of 5 dollar bills and coins...we are totally confused why.  And then  says as my friends were in the washroom that we owed her money.  I asked how much as it look like there was enough there but in the heat of the moment I tossed her a $20.  I totally regret that because it didn't make sense and in my uber pool home,I mentioned it to the other passengers and they noted that they are scammers there... BEWARE"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday to meet up with a friend before my husband and I went to a dinner reservation at a restaurant nearby so we only order drinks. We were there for about 45 minutes and my husband and I each ordered two drinks. I got The Sling and Whiskey Sour. The Whiskey sour was delicious! The sling was good too but nothing to write home about. The food that we saw being taking to the other tables look pretty good, but of course I am not giving ratings based on that. If you are looked for a place with a great cocktail menu this is a good place to consider. There is a lots of seating and the staff was friendly and the service was timely."}
{"text":"When I think of this bar I think of the holy trinity of bars in Yorkville.

Remy's -- The smartest looking one of the bunch although overpriced.
Hemingway's -- Half divey looking with a great patio
The Pilot -- The least pretentious of the three, a bit more divey looking but also with a nice patio.  

So Hemingway is sort of the the mid-point and probably the most used of the three when I do have large get togethers.

Now, I have read some of the other reviews and I simply cannot relate to the \"snobbish\" attitude some of the other Yelpers have gotten in this place. In 9 years going there, no one has ever been snobbish to me. They may be very busy and at worse get a bit distracted but this place gets *packed* but that is different.  

As far as myself, I have spent 99% of the time I have been here on their upstairs patios which are great on a nice summer day. Which reminds me, after their latest renovations they actually build up this canopy setup on the patio which closed them up a bit as they are trying to keep them open for longer in the season. Which in a way makes the place feel more crowded with the (sometime) coverings overhead and metal work. Which is a shame since I liked it more when it was just a \"patio √† la natural.\"  

Their food is a bit above pub average/standards and their brunch is okay. You normally go here when you want to be in a place full of people and feed off the vibe. Also you can't beat the location as the thing is just across the Cumberland exit of the Bay subway station and steps away from the Cumberland 4. So it makes for the  perfect post movie drink locale.

Their indoor second floor is mostly \"meh\" where most of the locals who want to watch a game (hockey, basketball, et al) hang out. And their first floor is where you want to go if you want a bit more peace from the loud patios and where from time to time they will have a guy with a guitar riff some songs away. 

For those saying the place is not that cheap, taking into consideration the thing is in Yorkville, where you can pay $8 for a bottle of beer (at some clubs) then this place is actually cheaper. I mean, it's a pub in the end but they also know where they are located. 

All in all a great, a great if divey looking place to hangout when you want away with some of Yorkville's snobbishness, like the one you can get at say, a place like Amber. But that is for another review."}
{"text":"Good drinks and good times...on the patio.  Whenever I go here, I'm never disappointed but it isn't really my first choice.  The cool part is the year-round patio...that is FOREVER packed.  Their martinis are really decent, especially if you don't like anything too strong but you can get 3 oz and it still tastes like juice.  A decent place for drinks.  This is like the Cheers of Toronto.  For more adventure, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Always a classic. Great options for all, I really appreciate the vegan ones. I got the fajitas without cheese or sour cream, and they were really top notch - flavorful & delicious."}
{"text":"Always and I mean always packed. 
Cant tell just how humungous this place is from the outside but dang! The patio is lovely and large, but its still tough to get seating if youre in a group on a Friday or Saturday on the patio

Great location
Average prices"}
{"text":"went there in early may when it was still a bit chilly. so the patio was covered and thus didn't really impress me. but the place itself is huge and can sit hundreds I think. 
there is a bar upstairs that serves pub appetizers and there are more seating downstairs. 
will have to go there in the summer to get the full feeling of their famous patio=)"}
{"text":"Amazing nachos and yuuuuumy shrimp popcorn!! Great atmosphere and our server was awesome"}
{"text":"Fabulous top deck patio. Never disappoints! Always busy  winter summer no matter.
I always love coming here with my best friend people watch. The bar is great staff are friendly.
And I especially love the owner, Martin."}
{"text":"This place is really nice. I don't know why yelp says it's not good for kids: we've spent a wonderful time here tonight with my son (7 yo) and our friends. The food is really good, fresh and tasty, music choice is a bit out of sync with the interior, but overall it's really good."}
{"text":"I've been to Hemingway's a few times, and I've had great and not-so-good experience. My rating is probably closer to a 3.75. 

Generally the staff are polite and helpful. It can get quite busy on weekends/evenings - especially during the summer. It's has a great vibe and just perfect to hang out with friends. 

The food isn't bad at all, but I think I've mostly been here for drinks and late night bites. I did go for brunch recently, and it was good. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, with home fries on the side. Nothing too special, but it's nice to have a reliable/go-to place in the area."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Hemingway's. Both times I was only there for a drinks.

This time my date ordered a pitcher of Grapefruit Radler for us. Personally into lighter beers and pale ales and this beer was delicious! Like 75% grapefruit juice haha. Absolutely delicious!

The service was nice but they didn't come by frequently. Not that we were in need of frequent attention but the table next to us with a group of 6 seemed to desire it.

We ordered a plate of sweet potato fries to munch on. They weren't the best I've had but pretty good. Nice spicy mayo aioli to go with the fries.

The ladies washroom seems spacious when you enter but the stalls are pretty tight. This can be a dangerous thing in a bar when people with full bladders are trying to squeeze themselves into tiny stalls!!

Other than that, the atmosphere was nice. Casual and a cross between a dive bar and sports bar. All sorts of casual to super well dressed people in there.

We sat on the patio upstairs. It was half to 3/4 of the way full by the time we left. The middle floor seemed totally empty, same with the inside of the bottom floor. Most people seemed to enjoy the patio on the ground floor.

I would go back for the beer, to watch sports, or to enjoy the patio setting. I like that despite being in Yorkville, this place isn't the classiest joint!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something casual amongst all the upscale restaurants in the Yorkville area, this place is your jam. 

If I'm on a mission to sit on the patio, I typically call for a reservation because no matter day/season/time this place is always busy. 

There's nothing spectacular about this place - standard drinks, food, dessert. I've had the sweet potato fries, calamari and grilled salmon. Nothing I'll rave about but nothing I'll complain about.

I find the service is mediocre at best here but I also believe the patrons frequenting this establishment know what they're in for - most people are here to socialize, and as long as their drinks remain full, everyone's pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"I've been here many times with friends. The atmosphere is always so good during the summer.  We normally sit on the patio upstairs. It was pouring rain the last time I went but it was still very enjoyable on the patio when the roof was closed and we were able to hear the raindrops, which I found very nice.

What I've ordered:
1. Beef sandwich: 7.5/10 this was pretty good but not great 
2. Bruschetta with feta: 9/10. I loved this but I couldn't find it on the many when I went last week. 
3. Chicken Pappardelle pasta: 5/10. I really didn't like this. I couldn't even tell what was in the pasta. It was too spicy and the flavored didn't complement each other at all to me. I think there may have been too many spices which overpowered the other parts of the dish such as the parts itself and the meat. I was struggling to finish. I don't recommend this dish.

I'd like to try the fish tacos with fries as my friend recommended it to me when I complained about my chicken pappardelle pasta"}
{"text":"I was a little sad to read all the not so great reviews on this little place as we thoroughly enjoyed our lunch on their upper deck yesterday. We all ordered the grilled chicken, brie and apple sandwich with mango mayo and it was delicious. 

Our waiter was also amazing. He was clearly working hard for his tips and was friendly, accommodating and always checked back at just the right time."}
{"text":"Hemingway's has a good patio for the summer. I have been here now three times and generally enjoy the place. I was a bit annoyed last night, however, as I ordered a virgin mojito and was charged $6 for it. That seemed a little ridiculous, as it was more expensive than one of my friend's cocktails. 

All in all, though, Hemingway's is a fine place to go for drinks. Not the best, but fine."}
{"text":"Toronto is ripe with hopping places to be scene, and Hemingway's is a convenient mix of great food and place to be seen. With an indoor and outdoor section, the atmosphere is good, just pick...
The food was very good, a nice laid back menu, with the picture of a kiwi bird, as part of their logo...a tribute to the owners, from New Zealand.
We did the fish and chips, a couple of the Cumberland burgers, and my salad eating wife tried the grilled salmon salad.  I can say, all the meals were good sized, prepared spot-on, and had solid flavors.
It's tough finding food for teens, adding in allergies, and sometimes the options are limited.  But as for the food, my sons, loved the burger and fish & chips, wife, loves salmon, so everything was a hit.  I like a nice juicy burger with a healthy portion of onion, lettuce, tomato, and pickles, if available...I'm picky about the onions, and these were pretty good, standard white onion.  I'd have to say my favorite onions are Vidalia, perfect mix of sweetness and bite...man, I'm making my mouth water...
Find Hemingway's, then the right atmosphere and the rest will fall into place...enjoy..."}
{"text":"When I say Hemingways you say Yuppies: Hemingways!.... 
No one? really? Alright then...

Yes, Hemingways is a yuppie hangout spot. I think they breed them here, in the back, near the kitchen. There's reason for this, besides it being in the middle of Yorkville it has a great yuppie patio. It's on the third floor so you can always be looking down at people, yuppie style.

They also serve decent yuppie food. Their fried calamari is probably the best I've had in Toronto. Their fries are also delicious, reminiscent of KFC fries done right (you know, with those crunchy bits attached).

The Brunch menu is nothing special however, very plain, very sandwich and breakfast platter oriented. Not creative but nothing to complain about either.  

So why do I like this place? Well... I'm a yuppie. The crowd is yuppie-ish with a dash of student here and there. It's a casual setting for a relaxing night after a long week. Nothing beats a yuppie patio, yuppie beer, and a nice yuppie breeze on a summers day.

HEAT LAMPS ARE HERE FOR THE THE FALL!"}
{"text":"Cool place with an awesome back patio. The drinks are really good, and the food is decent!"}
{"text":"Went to Hemingway's with the work team. I got the Cumberland burger which was really good. I tend to like the burgers in Canada even though they cook them well done. The waitress was nice and the food came pretty quickly but I did not get a refill on my water. Just a personal pet peeve of mine to have to ask for a refill. Food is a little pricey for what it is but since I'm in Canada in may 2017 the exchange rate makes it like 30% off anyways so not bad. Would recommend this place if your looking for a relaxed atmosphere with some pretty good food."}
{"text":"Hemmingway's is fantastic for a beer with friends. We all enjoyed seeing in the New Year at Hemmingways where they had a great band on downstairs. 

The lamb burger is rather tasty, as is the Jambalaya which my friend enjoyed. The food and appetizers are very fairly priced & I would recommend for a casual dinner, nothing formal at all. 

My only issue is the service is slow & often I find the waitresses to be a little cold. It takes the shine off what I think is a unique & pretty cool place in Yorkville."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant has the best calamari in the town.
I often have a pint and an appetizer when I walk by.
The patio is not bad during summer time.
However, there are tons of better bars/restaurants in the near distance."}
{"text":"Ambience is great, but service was very slow, wish they would take service into higher consideration.  I actually had to get up and get utensils for our table."}
{"text":"I liked that, despite the location in swanky Yorkville, this place was pretty chill all-around.  Being near UofT, many bars in the area were kind of annoying and swamped with undergrads, but I really enjoyed going here.  The food isn't bad, either - especially off of the bar menu (which is reasonably priced).  And the location's great - right in the heart of Yorkville.  Somehow, though, in the 2 years I regularly came here, I never made it to the roof!"}
{"text":"BEST Pad Thai I've ever had...I was hesitant to order it because this isn't a Thai restaurant so I wasn't sure if it would be good. I'm so glad I decided to go for it because I still compare all of the Pad Thais I've had since then to this one and it's been TWO years since I had it. Full of meat, full of flavor and just full of goodness in general. If you go for dinner and you like Pad Thai or hell even if you don't... def order it and you'll LOVE it!

Only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because the service was a little slow"}
{"text":"HEATED rooftop patio with a generous crowd to keep you company. Most people seemed really drunk. I wouldn't call Hemingways a \"restaurant\" but they do have sweet potato fries with spicy mayo and they are delicious. The menu consists of standard pub fare. Drinks are reasonably priced, the staff in friendly, and its a good spot to get a late night snack with your drink. It seems like they could benefit from more staff, though, because my server was swamped and I had to find her to get my bill and pay for it."}
{"text":"This was about what I expected.  I came to Hemingway's on a nice Friday night, hoping to sit outside with my group of 4.  Unfortunately we were STARVING and couldn't wait the 45 minutes we were quoted so we sat inside.  Inside was unimpressive, but, it is a pub after all.  They had a very strange menu, like the chef was having an identity crisis.  Definitely not what I expected for an Aussie/New Zealand bar, or a traditional pub.  I ordered the butter chicken, and was told it would be spicy.  When they said that, I felt like it was probably a lie, as, after all, we were at a pub, not at a curry house.  I was right, it was probably the least spicy dish ever.  
Everything else was pretty unmemorable.  One thing to note is that the wine menu is pretty decent, or at least they had some good New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc's."}
{"text":"Great bar bites (Sweet potato fries, etc) and an extensive drinks menu. The drink I usually order has a few modifications to it and while we've had a different server every time, they never get it wrong.

I've been here dozens of times and have received a consistently good quality of service. My only contention is that it is extremely, extremely noisy, but I guess that's just because they're so popular. They have multiple patios, which are open and heated during the winter as well :)

It isn't fabulous, but it's in a great location and the perfect balance between dive and spiffy... perfect for a TGIF drink and catch up session.

Also... love the bathrooms. Always really clean, and there's SO many stalls; nothing infuriates me more than when a place of this size has 2 poorly-tended to stalls."}
{"text":"Local haunt in Yorkville. Much more relaxed and community than other places in the 4 block radius. Great selection of beer. Wine by the glass is good and some solid food in the menu. The calamari is a staple in the neighbourhood and rightly so."}
{"text":"Solid bar. Diverse population as it's not typically priced for the Yorkville area (slightly cheaper). Decent service. Martini's aren't bad. Never had the food. The patio is full of people either smoking or clamoring for a light. People are friendly and like to start up conversations. Single men/women drink up and act like they have something to do until they find someone friendly, and as the night goes on, inch into each others laps. (So also, if you are in need of a chuckle, a great representation of homo sapien pre-mating rituals). 
It's clearly an after-work watering hole for many, the atmosphere isn't pretentious, and the prices are okay. For some reason, this place has the faint vibe of a dive bar."}
{"text":"There was a hair in my fathers burger and all management gave him was a free coke. A coke at a restaurant costs $0.05. That was insulting."}
{"text":"Disappointingly mediocre would about sum it up. 

I can't say I had high expectations for this place, given its rating right here on Yelp, however the last few good reviews and the fact that everyone else in my group wanted to go to this particular restaurant, made me hope for more. 

There was nothing to be excited about, simply because the food is pretty blah - horrible fries (I really have to put emphasis on how horrible they were), and a run of a mill burger (despite a fancy name - Kiwi Lamb Burger). 

Had to wait for a long time to get our bill - doesn't score points in my book, but doesn't affect my star rating. 

The place is cozy, the prices are very un-Yorkville like, so the saving grace of this place could be stopping by for a quick beer. 

Won't repeat if I don't have to."}
{"text":"Casual bar... Always vibrant.. great food...
Their cocktails are not great... but its good if ur heading there for beer or wine"}
{"text":"Patio upstairs is heated! Love it. Service is usually good, no complaints there. The California chicken wrap is amazingggg!"}
{"text":"Two stars says it all. My burger was meh and my wife's wings were overcooked and bland. Plus the Caesars weren't that great either."}
{"text":"Food and drinks aren't anything over the top - just your typical bar food. Atmosphere is very lively. If you're broke and happen to be in Yorkville, Hemingway's is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Spent the afternoon here watching the Rugby World Cup. Attentive staff, great drinks and fantastic fish and chips. Definitely the place to be for sporting events and fully intend on frequenting again!"}
{"text":"I would give an extra star for their events - I was there for a trivia night and it was great! They have special themed cocktails for $9 each. I also love the idea of silent disco that they have on some nights

But solid pub food on any given day, I had the fish tacos. The fish was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside with some good chipotle mayo inside, and fresh tomato salsa. However, the inside also just had bagged shredded cheese and the tortilla was the plain ol ones from the grocery store, so it didnt feel very special. The ceaser salad side was an extra $2 which was alright, I should have opted for the free garden side or their fries (which are the generic costco ones but was still good in all its deep fried goodness) It was a big portion and I was very full after. The jerk chicken burrito that my friend had looked pretty good though. A few of the servers were also lovely and was very friendly! Not somewhere I'd choose immediately when im in the area but if someone suggests it, I wouldn't oppose to hard."}
{"text":"Been here many times for lunch and after work drinks.  My last visited prompted me to make this review.  We sat on the rooftop patio.  Food was decent as usual.  This time there was a surprise in my serviette-wrapped pair of utensils -- a cockroach."}
{"text":"Ahhh, Hemingway's.  What to say, what to say.  I go here about 10x a year.  I work across the street.  It serves as a standby for coworker lunches, after-work drinks and the occasional take out lunch (I like to take out from here in those -20+ temps b/c then I don't have to go far).

I have tried many of the menu items, but as of late, I only ever order the clubhouse sandwich with a side caesar.  I love it b/c it is simple, yet delicious.  A couple of wins on this meal: good caesar, not under-dressed, sandwich is neat and tidy and uniform, the chicken is tasty, the bacon is never undercooked.  The mayo on the side has some sort of crack-cociane in it, truly delicious and addictive.  

What do I dislike about Hemingway's?  Food is relatively uninspired and ho-hum.  The service is either great or terrible, never in between.  Finally, they almost always screw up my take out order and I'm so rushed and dumb that I often forget to check (perhaps the last time it happened will finally be the last time!  I'm not that foolish, I hope).  Nothing worse then getting back to your desk and realizing that the crack-mayo is not included or they gave me fries instead of salad.  For that Hemingway's, you get 3 stars.  

Don't waste your time here AND ALSO don't worry about ending up here.  A true 3-star place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and people. However service was lacking on a Friday night. She poured wine in my beer glass, but missed, and drenched my phone instead. To make up for the spoiled beer and sticky phone, only half a pint was given as compensation. 

In Yorkville I expect better service and Ernest would not be impressed."}
{"text":"Hemingway's is a great Yorkville spot, at moderate Parkdale-ish prices. 

It attracts everyone from frat boys, to lawyers, to pro sports players and celebs, but has a great atmosphere on any given night. In the summer there will be a lineup on Friday and Saturdays. Service can be slow on these nights, so be patient.

I recommend the \"Shotover\". It's the second level, same level as the bathrooms, on the South side. The main patios get ram-jammed most nights, plus the 'Shotover' folk tend to be more chilled out. 

They serve great pub food until 2am, which is a huge bonus. Check it out on a random evening with pals, you won't be disappointed.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Huh? Wha? What is this place? The food, drink, service, ambience + decor is all extremely mediocre but the prices are still high. This reminds me of the places I liked to hang out when I was 19. I will try my darnedest not to get dragged here again by friends."}
{"text":"Love this place! Met some friends - I wasn't hungry but I ordered some sweet potato fries.. So far the best I've had.. and I've had it three times this week! What can I say? I love my sweet potato fries. 

The beer selection was perfect and the service was really good for being so crowded on a Fri night. 

Great place to hang with friends.."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place gets bad reviews. It's still a bit pricy (cheap for yorkville though), a bomb-diggity patio & awesome portions of food. I recommend the curry. 
It's 3 stars, not 4 only because I am a student and its not really in my budget but I still like it and I'll be back for patio fun!"}
{"text":"The only thing that is a positive for this place is that it is huge.  There is a small patio out in front but a really big one upstairs.  Unfortunately to get upstairs you have to walk by a smell that you really can't put your finger on...until you are halfway up the stairs and realize it's a faint urine kinda smell.

This place gets pretty packed - it's open until 2am and really is the only \"cheap\" place to get some food/drinks and watch the game in this area (offskirts of Yorkville).  I had the Boston Clam chowder (it's famous!  on the menu for 35 years!).  Yeah...not so good.  Some of the clams had a gritty texture which meant they weren't cleaned correctly.  Also the soup was bland - i had to add salt/pepper to give it any flavour.

I also had the margherita pizza.  Blah.  I added hot sauce to it and well...still blah.  

Come here for the drinks and the game.  Get food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely amazing.
This is probably the best-priced patio you can find in the city, with the most extensive menu. 
Took my family here for my dad's birthday and they took good care of us. Would highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Whilst I have enjoyed the patio here, the most recent experience stinks and we cannot justify giving any more money to this place. They are advertising they are a Dutch world cup bar, but I won't be watching any more games here.... tiny TVs and simply awful customer service.

We were there to watch the Netherlands game yesterday and the first waitress proceeded to make us settle our bills in the final 10 minutes of the game!! When my girlfriend later mentioned this to the manager as a friendly piece of feedback after he asked how our stay was, he was extremely rude and condescending, immediately replied with \"that is the schedule\" and \"are you trying to tell me how to run my bar?\" and LAUGHED at her for even suggesting this was a wrong thing to do!! If you're playing the game on all TVs for your guests and anticipate a big Dutch crowd, do not interrupt the game, especially at a crucial point!!! Bad planning, and extremely poor customer service, where a simple recognition of the oversight would have done. 

Second waitress then tried to overcharge us for quite a large number of drinks that weren't ours (totally different drinks than what we had), and she was extremely rude and demanded they were ours! I know it was busy, but keeping track of the drinks is the server's job and why we pay the 17% auto gratuity that was added. Don't take customers for fools. 

All in all a terrible place to watch the game with bad attitude from management down. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"It is a great restaurant that provides a premium dining experience without the cost for it. I really loved the food and their patio is awesome."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short: nice cocktails, great atmosphere and location. Service was fast, too. Don't order food unless you're really hungry - nothing of what we tried tasted good. 
I'd come here for drinks."}
{"text":"i dont remember much past the rich lacquered brown of the bar at the front and its brass defenders.  thats the first floor.  i havent read any of the other reviews yet but id bet on all of them mentioning the rooftop patio.

sometimes thats all that it takes for a place to both rise above its neighbours, and outlast the competition.  For hemingways, has been around for a number of years now.  

on a sultry summers night you can feel like your at some club in the tropics (whatever the hell that means).  maybe its just the excitement of being on a rooftop patio.  its all made of wood as you might expect and the bar sits as a rectangle in the centre of the room.

ive only ever come here, (that i can remember) for drinks late at night;  this very much seems like a nice late night hang out for flirts, a cool down for waiters post shift.  even in the winter its still opened though its sealed like a boat or a convertable.  lots of canvas and soft windows.  it completes itself with heated trees and your golden.

for convenience, once youve drank your wallet dry, you can take a mere step or two off the patio and look to the right for the atm.  ah, convenience."}
{"text":"My coworkers hang out at Hemingway's all the time!  It's like their equivalent to Moe's.  I can see why they like that place so much, the prices are reasonable, the restaurant is cool... etc etc.  I loved their pizza from there!  And I didn't have to wait 20 minutes for tap water!"}
{"text":"Many levels, patio on roof with heaters, no live music, prices fair for Yorkville.  Pleasant cordial service by young people, friendly"}
{"text":"A few of my co-workers often mention Hemmingway's as a favorite after-work haunt and I finally went there on a Sunday night for a co-worker's farewell get-together.
There's a spacious patio on the top floor which would look really rad during the day.
Decent drink, I enjoyed all my cocktails and mixers. My Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich did the trick and made my stomach happy but the Onion Rings my guilty pleasure were even more satisfying. And since I was in the mood, I also had the Caramel Brownie Cheesecake which was so rich and decadent that it strongly marked the end of my meal for that night.
I'll definitely come back here for another special occasion :-)"}
{"text":"This is an interesting spot in this area of town.  It's not particularly ritzy or modern or even ridiculously expensive like many of its sit down counter parts.  So this place is popular.

The menu has something for everyone from sandwiches to pasta to nachos and yes, it's the kind of place that serves chicken fingers. 

It's popularity is based on the easy going nature. Patios and always a sports game playing.  So what this place is to people who live in the area is a comfortable, unpretentious spot to eat and be chill. Although there's some patrons that think that works in here....and it makes me giggle. It's basically a pub no need for that.

Food here arrives quickly upon order so you won't have to wait long. Must say the speed was amazing. I'd go here again simply for that reason. I hate waiting when I am starving."}
{"text":"I've been to Hemingway's about three to four times with co-workers during lunch and once for drinks after work, and I have had an equally pleasant experience each time.  Their rooftop patio has a fantastic atmosphere and feels very cozy.  They have a nice retractable roof that can be used when it rains.  

I've tried their burger, their steak, and the jerk chicken wrap and enjoyed all of them very much.  In my opinion, the food quality is on par and met my expectations for sure.  The service has been fairly attentive here each time, and I never felt that the servers were overbearing or not adequately present.  Apparently this place is a hot-spot for celebrities during TIFF.  I will definitely return Hemingway's in the near future for drinks and food!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Long lines and the location can use an update on their decor. Lots of stairs to get to the top floor. 

Other options in the area - not worth waiting in line to get in. 

3.25/5.0"}
{"text":"I would give 4/5 based on the fact that they had an awesome misting system that helped on a very hot day.

Drink prices were average.

My friend had the pad Thai which was great. I had the special (catfish) which was average. Service was 4/5."}
{"text":"The food is a 3 out of 5, and the atmosphere is a 4 during the day, but a 5 in the evenings. Service is alright. The servers aren't very attentive, but they'll get the job done. Their fish tacos are apparently amazing. I've had it once, and I've had better, but they're still delicious. I've also had their chicken sandwich, and their chicken souvlaki - I'd order both again, but I'd stay away from their side salad (leaves were wilted and carrots were really dry and some were squishy..). I'd come here just for their fries and a beer. Their fries are like Costco's. Super crispy and they almost taste like there's some other seasoning on them, because it's not as plain as salt and pepper."}
{"text":"En pause pendant la visite du ROM nous sommes venus le 1er janvier dans cet √©tablissement qui √©tait ouvert.

Une carte orient√© bistrot simple et classique.

Le club sandwich √©tait bon ainsi que les frites qui l'accompagnait tout comme le wrap au poulet-brie-pomme.
Rien de bien extraordinaire mais c'est ce qu'il faut lorsque l'on veut manger rapide et simple.

Le service agr√©able et servis assez rapidement !"}
{"text":"A Yorkville staple for the locals!

I've been a few times and have had great food and even better service. 

Pear salad, pizzas, nachos, sweet potato fries and the cocktails are all great.

It's a causal pub like environment and perfect spot for getting together with friends after work.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hemingways is alright. The food is passable. They have beers and make decent mixed drinks.

But there is nothing terribly special about it.

I live in the area, so I normally pass by on a friday or saturday night and there is a long line. Why would anyone wait in line here?!?!!?

(There are other patios in yorkville)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night. Got seated immediately on their rooftop patio, which is quite nice. The server came to us once when we sat down and got us our drinks; then, he never came back for the next 45 minutes. We were trying so hard to get his attention but it's was like we were non Existent. We even made friends with the couple sitting next to us because we were both trying to get our server's attention, and they told us it's been like this the entire night for them. The food was pretty decent, and it came out quick after we ordered, so no hard feelings there. It was just the lack of attention we received from the server that that left a really bad first impression. Should definitely consider putting more staffs on if they are understaffed. They could probably use some re-training, or perhaps at least learn to apologize for ghosting us for 20-45 minutes throughout the night."}
{"text":"The name of the bar attracted us to stop by last nights. The place was crowded, it is good sign that it is recommended place to go. We only had a drink and it has an excellent ambience, good service and reasonable price. I will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. 

Terrible service, or actually, no service at all. 
According to the waiter, his job is not to offer any water, starters or dessert. His job is not to ask if the food is alright or if i want to order anything else. His job is also not to remove the empty plates that have been sitting on the table for 1.5 hours, no, he has nothing to do with that. 
If I want to pay for the food I finished an hour and a half ago, I have to wave my card/dollar bills to his face so that he gets the message, because asking for the bill didn't signal that I want to pay and get the hell out of there. 

When I order two (2) fish and chips (given that there are 2 people), I expect to get 2 orders of fish and chips. When the waiter brings one order and says \"that's two servings\", it shows he has no idea what's going on, and when he confirms that that plate has 2 servings and yet he charges for 1... that's when you know he wasn't even listening to himself. It's like ordering 2 burgers (for 2 people) and getting 1 single burger and the waiter says \"that's 2 burgers\".... 

I asked him if I could get any service and he was shocked. I said water would have been nice and he looked at me like i was asking for something they didn't serve. 
He said i am the one that has to go to him when I want something. If I wanted to go to some self-service restaurant, I would've gone for fast food. It would've taken me way less time and no expectations. YOUR MEDIOCRE FOOD IS NOT WORTH THIS, HEMINGWAY'S!!!"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for business. Last visit stopped in at Lobby for an upscale night and I was on the hunt for something casual and relaxed. An accidental, but excellent find, was Hemingway's. I had the recommended bar foods and sweet potato fries as well as an assortment of draft beers. 

The staff was friendly, smiling, and made me feel like a local. This scores big points with a constant traveler. The atmosphere was laid back and very casual with an attractive staff. 

I will return during my next visit."}
{"text":"I was there on June 30,2011.  I loved sitting out on the patio.  America doesn't have enough of these kind of places where one can go and sit with friends and enjoy the weather..  This is a comfortable , affordable and fun place.  I ate a ravioli pasta with no cheese. It had asparagus on top and other veggies...  it was nice.  The wine was good.  I  have no complaints.   I miss Toronto and Yorkville!!"}
{"text":"Go for the patio, stay for the lamb burger. 

In a menu that is generally a great big \"good enough\", the lamb burger is simply mind blowing. Covered in goat cheese and mint sauce, it's the only actual reason I have to be in yorkville at any given time. Their fries are pretty decent too, but I wouldn't waste your time with the wings. 

Lamb burger for the win!"}
{"text":"Only went there for drinks but they service was amazing. Laura was a great server and bartender. Very attentive even though the were slammed. I never say with an empty glass. Best service I had the entire trip to Toronto. Well worth the hike up to Yorkville."}
{"text":"I've walked by here many times wondering what this place is about!  Came here with a work colleague to discuss some business and have a meal in a nice enviro!  Firstly the patio upstairs is really loud!  I ordered a Caesar salad and a Panko breaded Basa.  Fish came out with rice and veg that had a very nice flavour!  The panko crusted Basa had a fantastic Mango avocado salsa on top!  Heat lamps were on when we were there and I was trying to figure out how the tent top above the heat lamps does not catch on fire as it was pretty toasty!  In the summer this would be a great place for snacks, a quick dinner or drinks!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! This place has a covered heated patio upstairs that is quite busy all the time! Came on a Thursday evening for drinks and the place was hoping! It was a miserable, rainy day outside, but the patio was still nice.

Service was fast, friendly and consistent. Drinks were kind of watery, but not overly expensive (considering this place is in Yorkville). 

It gets quite loud, so if you're looking for something more intimate, this might not be your place. But I liked the bustling and loud atmosphere."}
{"text":"An old standby favourite. The food is decent, the drinks are very good (the pi√±a colada especially), and the service is hit or miss (some friendly, some not as friendly). This place has quite a following on a weekend night, it gets packed, but there is a lot of seating, and nice outdoor patios."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an affordable place to grab a drink in Yorkville, this is the place. Be warned though...food is ho-hum, service is slow and atmosphere lacks. I also think that if your seeking a summer patio your better off across the lane at Remy's where the people are far more interesting."}
{"text":"This is the go-to place for folks in my office. They have a large covered patio that opens even during winter, though it's still quite cold despite the covers and the heat lamps.

This is your typical bar food joint with a casual vibe and a team of friendly staff. It's everything you expect and a tiny bit more."}
{"text":"When my girls and I feel like having our egos stroked and spending some time outside we go to Hemingway/s.

This Yorkville  bar/restaurant/patio is :
1. Not a place to go to in any season but summer
2. Not a place to go to eat anything other than nachos

The upstairs patio is always busy so ideally Hemingway's is an after work place.  I go there to have drinks on a Thursday or Friday between 6 and 11, that way I get the best of  all worlds  -- a little bit of sun, a little bit of food, and a lot of flirting."}
{"text":"This restaurant does not disappoint. I ordered the Pad Thai, which was labeled for spicy lovers only, and it was absolutely delicious and lived up to its name.  For those who like a little kick in their food, this dish will do.  You get a good amount of food for a decent price, and it taste exquisite.  Not only is the food great, the atmosphere makes it even better.  From the heated patios to the ambient lighting, Hemingway's is a great place to get bar snacks and cocktails with your friends, or order a full meal.  I highly recommend coming here for fun times and great food!"}
{"text":"Lovely place to dine in. We liked it. The patio was closed so sat on the upper floor, which is really good/unique.

There was a variety of food and I ordered lamb curry with white rice,it was moist and tasty and it includes a wide variety of beers.  The server was very knowledgeable about all the beers.

They have day specials too."}
{"text":"I'd give it 2 stars, but the patios are lovely. The food, service, and drinks? Pffff. The clam chowder was tasty, but was entirely butter & cream. The caesar cocktail was the worst I've ever had; more Worchestershire sauce than Clamato. I couldn't even finish it. The kitchen screwed up 2 of our meals (one who asked for fries got salad, one who wanted salad got fries). My appetizer came at the same time as my main. My grilled cheese & bacon sammie was cold and the cheese had re-hardened.  This place is OK if you want a mediocre snack & beer on a patio. Otherwise, pass. Soooo tempted to remove that third star..."}
{"text":"This review is a difficult one. 

How old are you? 

If you're in your young twenties it's a 5/5 star. You've got narrow floors stacked on top each other and more then enough to drink. 

If you're in your thirties you can enjoy from a wide menu and stack drinks without breaking the bank. 

If you're still reading you might be in your forties or more. But you also didn't give up from the enforcement of drinks so it's just a fun time with good food and fast service. 

This also might be the most affordable place to hangout in Yorkville, the HQ of Toronto's mink mile. A huge transformation from the hippie neighbourhood it was during the 60's and 70's."}
{"text":"Tried and true for the last few years, this place is always a good spot - have had almost everything on the menu, but the lamb burger is definitely my number one recommendation.  The apple pie a la mode is amazing for dessert.

One of the best patios in the city, good atmosphere and non-pretentious clientele, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Gord and I had an early supper Saturday at Hemingway's.

We sat on the downstairs patio.

I had chicken wings and fries with medium sauce ... they were okay, not great (eight wings for $11.99).  Gord had fish 'n chips ... I liked his meal better.

The service was sketchy.  A young fella started serving us but kept disappearing.  It took a long time to be able to get our drinks ordered and people who came after us were getting served ahead of us.  Alanna seemed to take over and she was better ... before it was time for her to go home.  At one point, there were four staff standing in the doorway chatting while customers waited to be served."}
{"text":"I love Hemmingway's, but to a degree. My biggest issue is that it is ALWAYS packed when I end up going. 

But the Nachos and Quesadillas a great as most pub fare will be and so is the drinks that the bar provides. They make a decent Gin and Tonic and the beers available will match and accommodate most palates, 

It does get noisy and crowded, but if you do get a chance to sit outside on a summer evening, it is well worth it. It's gorgeous and in the right spot to feel right at home in Toronto."}
{"text":"When I order a steak at a bar, I know exactly what I'm going to get. And I get exactly that every time. So guess what... I didn't order a steak at this bar because I'm not pretentious enough to expect that every steak I eat is to be a prime cut of anti-PETA goodness.  For God's sake, Morton's is right across the Ave if you want steak. 

For bar food however, pretty decent.  Quesadilla was huge, and they had probably the least breaded popcorn shrimp I've ever eaten. Beer selection was good, but for a visitor like me who has no clue of the local brew scene, I had to go through a couple suggestions from the server before I found something I liked. 

Service was slow initially... this seems to be a trend.  After being seated on the patio upstairs, it took our server over nearly ten minutes to take our drink order... though the table of eight guys and one hot chick (a non-representative ratio, but entertaining to watch, nonetheless) at the table next to us who was ordering three shots each at a time was probably just as much to blame. 

Thank you for staying open until your posted hours.  Our plane arrived late and we went to three restaurants who were supposed to be open, only to see chairs on tables."}
{"text":"On a very recent trip back to Toronto, a couple of girlfriends took me out to Hemingway's. I'm pretty easy going when it comes to this city, seeing that I don't know my way around any longer. So, instead, I follow. 

I've been wracking my head for a good excuse to pass my experience off as somewhat decent, but I just can't. There is no excuse at all.

It's a relaxed bar with multiple levels and plenty of seating to house several hockey teams, but I suppose it was a venue I wasn't expecting to see in Yorkville - the snooty and snarky comments can begin/end now.

Beyond the decor, or lack thereof, and general atmosphere, the food was less than desirable. We (when I say we, I mean Angela) ordered off the Snack Menu, which by the way, seemed to have traveled all over the world during an apparent crisis of some sort. From the grilled teriyaki NY strip loin with melted cheddar cheese, butter, sour cream, all stuffed in a baked potato (what the heck?!) to the edamame beans, spring rolls, and samosas, I began to wonder if anyone actually ordered any of this stuff. 

And then I got my answer.. not only did Angela order edamame but she also ordered the samosas! Tragic, really, because even when I could foresee the car crash that was about to happen, she was genuinely disappointed when neither snack tasted all that good. Now mind you, they do have the usual bar fare of chicken fingers, wings, calamari, nachos, etc. but nothing that I could bring myself to eat. 

On a positive note, I thoroughly enjoyed the company. Old friends, old loves. Love not the place, but the company you keep."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with both service and food. I came here on a busy Friday evening. The server we had was named Celine. My friends arrived before me as I was travelling from Mississauga to catch up with them and had ordered/started eating before me. When I got there Celine didn't bother to greet me at all. 10 minutes into sitting down I started frantically waving her down so I can get a glass of water and ordered the jerk chicken burrito. Not only was her attitude extremely rude without apologizing for not attending to me sooner, she looked like she didn't want to be there working. After ordering I asked if there's anyway they can speed it up since my friends were already almost finish, without evening thinking Celine says to me \" well you should have came earlier then.\" The worst customer service I have ever received and the food was COLD. Don't ever come here."}
{"text":"Delicious soup, good cider on tap, nice waitress.  I was recommended this place by a local since it is reasonable and has outdoor seating.  I was not disappointed.  Surprisingly very clean bathrooms! (Downstairs is currently under renovation.)"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot in Yorkville, good place to have a drink and meet new people. It tends to be quite busy at times, yet it is definitely a great spot for affordable drinks in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Foods average but its a great place to stop by for a beer in the summer. Not as pretentious as other Yorkville spots, one of the first places i'd recommend in that neighborhood along with The Pilot."}
{"text":"This Yorkville staple has good beer options, and prices are decent (under $20 for most dishes). It is not unusual to bump into celebrities at this joint. I recommend you make a reservation if coming with a large group. In fact, I came here with a friend after work and had to wait 20 minutes for a table! The patio is packed all year round, and it can feel like a sauna in the winter months. One does not come here for the food, but rather, the company."}
{"text":"I come here for the patio. The food is quite good and the service is friendly enough. It can get expensive but it's Yorkville so..."}
{"text":"We came here for drinks after work.

The 2 stars represent the lethargic, unenthusiastic and blunt service we received from our server. She really has not been taught how to treat customers.

I ordered a pinot noit, from NZ's Oyster Bay winery, which had light fizzy taste! I believe it was also kept refrigerated."}
{"text":"I came on a Wednesday night around 6:30 and got seated almost immediately on their patio. After reading many reviews I was a little worried about how the service was going to be but we never had to even call our server as she kept coming around getting drink and food orders and making sure our food was okay when it was delivered and asking if we wanted another drink when we had finished our first. 

I had the Hemingway's fried chicken and it was a little over cooked. It's not really traditional fried chicken and kind of reminded me of chicken nuggets. The potato salad that they served with it was good though. My friend had the California chicken wrap with a Caesar salad and that was really tasty. 

Overall it was a really good atmosphere. It was crowded and it seemed like everyone was having a nice time. They have a huge patio space. I would go again"}
{"text":"Went there for a quick beer after work with a friend and thought everything was good.  Quick service, decent prices, and our appetizer was also tasty.  It's a really nice place to goto on a warm summer day, as half the restaurant is a patio.  The patio's are mostly covered so even if the weathers not perfect you don't have to worry about getting soaked or it being too windy.  If you want to be a trend setter (or have some privacy), go all the way up to the 3rd floor patio which is almost always empty (until everywhere else fills up of course)."}
{"text":"I think Hemingway needs to re- look at training their hostess. Came here for an after work drink and usually has no problems getting a quick drink in and out. 
But was not happy when the hostess was not polite and when I see so many empty tables around she wouldn't even seat me and my friend for a quick drink at the rooftop patio. Her reason given, \"I'm sorry I cannot seat two people in a four people table, and those are for other customers\" Clearly, it doesn't matter that the tables of four can be separated into a table of two. So I think it's just a poor judgement and decision making. There are more proper ways to handle, probably suggesting the approximate wait times, standing and ordering the drink at the bar ( where seats were clearly available) or even serious the table of four that was available to a table of two). 

Sorry Hemingway you've lost both me and my friend as customers and my default go to pub business now goes to The Pilot."}
{"text":"People get WRECKED here!!

It's such cool a place.  Has fairly average, to below average food, but the prices are reasonable and the ambiance is pure insanity at like 8 pm on a Friday.  Especially in the summers.

While I don't go there as much as I used to, my friends have seen Kelly Hrudy, Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel there....If you're into that sort of thing, that can be cool.

I also find that even though it looks pretty casual inside, people still tend to dress up when they go there.  

Always a good time. 

I've never regretted a night there!"}
{"text":"Hemingway's is a go-to after work drinking hole for business peeps working in the Yorkville area. We typically go here Fridays after work to get the party started. Later on into the evening the people get drunker and uglier.

The patrons are very diverse but definitely NOT what you are expecting in Yorkville. (psss - \"Where did these people COME FROM?!\") You get your scantily clad females, university students, old men, creepy men, old creepy men and your regular 9-5ers.

The pub is owned by a nice kiwi man (New Zealander) and he keeps the prices reasonable which is why this place draws such a crowd. Huge with numerous patios, the biggest and most popular one is on the third floor at the back. 

I always get extremely pissed off because they have some kind of sprinkler system overheard that shoots \"mist\" down over all the tables on the really hot days. WTF? Stop that shit, it ruins my hair-do.

Food is typical uninventive pub crap that comes from a box and is deep fried. Burgers are passable when you are drunk."}
{"text":"This place is a laid back pub surrounded by trendy bars in the fashionable Yorkville neighbourhood.  It's sort of a refreshing change.  The atmosphere is very nice.  There are serveral sections to the pub, but the heart of it is the large rooftop patio.  It's always buzzing with activity.  

The food is just your standard pub fair.  Don't expect fine dining.  You come here for the cold beer, and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch on a Saturday and thoroughly enjoyed the food (burger for my husband, fish and chips / clam chowder for me).   Huge selection of perfectly cold draught beer (Molson = $5.50, Rickerts Red = $6..yum!)  The fish was Halibut and perfectly cooked - crispy and delicious batter, two large pieces and a healthy serving of \"chips\" (Fries) for $13.  Great value for the area...for anywhere actually.  

We were lunching with my 13 year old son and sat outside.  The waitress was kind enough to overlook that he'd brought a sandwich with him that was just purchased at a nearby Deli.  When the smoker's ashes from the balcony above us landed on my husbands lap - twice before he heard us holler up to ask him to stop - the waitress noticed, assured us that the Manager was going there to talk to that group, and then offered us a complimentary dessert to make up for it.  

We were stuffed and declined the dessert, but over-tipped the waitress.  Great atmosphere, clean ladies rooms (downstairs), and excellent people-watching location - - throw in great food and why wouldn't you pop in here??"}
{"text":"They only have 2 kinds of pizzas, but I think they're worth the try. Crowded patio with all sorts of age groups. It's a very cozy place for afternoon drinks on hot summer days and also a hip place to hang out at night. Excellent service and they don't mind splitting the bill."}
{"text":"Great price and great for groups for where it is located.  Great place to come after work and also a nice place to relax and just eat great food. I had their salmon salad and through to their nachos. All good food."}
{"text":"Came to Hemingway's for a late dinner after work. It was pretty quiet, but it's a Monday night so that's kind of expected.

I was greeting very graciously by a number of the staff members before being seated to a table by the front window. 

The server was very attentive and friendly. He brought us our drinks promptly and was very helpful with his menu recommendations. I got the beet and pear salad and my date had the fish and chips. It didn't take too long for our food to arrive and both dishes looked delicious. We both ate our meals really quickly. 

As we were finishing our meals the place seemed to get busier with the later night bar crowd. Seems like a decent place to go for a drink after work as well as for food.

Will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"This review is mainly on the food. 

-Classic Burger: Ok, burger was thick and juicy. Bun was good. Priced very reasonably. 
-Eggs Hemingway (Eggs benny with smoked salmon):This dish was so terrible, I couldn't even finish it. The entire dish was room temp, at best. The egg muffin was of the texture that it was just pulled out of the fridge. The salmon tasted like canned salmon with a barely there smoke flavour. The \"home fries\" looked like potato scraps. I basically ate the eggs and left everything else on the plate. 
-Fish and Chips, substituted with sweet potato fries: The fish was massive. The fish part was really good. The batter was ok, a little on the thick side as it didn't seem thoroughly cooked through. Fries were crispy."}
{"text":"Oh, Hemingway's. Why do I always think every time is going to be different? Probably because you're named after a famous author (you know, that one that I know I have been meaning to/should probably/just haven't been able to get \"into\" yet?) and you're surrounded by the famous Yorkville glamour. Maybe cuz people wear suits to you.

Anyway, if anybody has read my reviews, you would know that food not booze always comes first. And so, this place doesn't usually do it for me. Now, don't get me wrong, the patio is pretty cool and the beer's you know, beer (in a good way), but I have wrongly stumbled in there more than once, STARVING and always leaving ~barely~ less so, and with apparent memory issues (get it?). The Pad Thai I had there last week was okay enough, but my friends found their \"sampler\" platter to be less than satisfying and suffering from lazy presentation. You'd think they'd be on top of that."}
{"text":"Went last night and it was a very poor meal. Chicken in club sandwich was dry. Fries were luke-warm. Combo special ribs were dry and the outside sauce was set, like it has stood for quite awhile, wings were tasty but Cesar salad was wilted. Overall it is a good vibe but the food was much worse than expected.  My advice is to eat elsewhere and pop into this place for a beer."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to walk in here at 8:00 on a Friday night and not find it packed. My group of 8 easily got a table. 

The waitress was there immediately and got our first round order taken. For dinner I went with the gourmet pizza off the snack menu. I really enjoyed it. It was a great blend of ingredients on a perfectly cooked thin crust. I would say the price was a little high, but considering you're in Yorkville, it's pretty reasonable.

The service could have been a little better. It's not that our server was bad, just that she was really busy and seemed like they were short staffed.

Overall a good experience and I'd come back here without question.

Nov. 30-day challenge 41/30"}
{"text":"Ahh Hemingway's is a classic! The atmosphere is fantastic - cozy and not pretentious, the food and drinks are good and not expensive. Their patio is a go-to spot during the spring/summer for drinks and to watch sports. ugh I love this place. I always order the Cajun fries and chicken fingers. Will be a customer here for life."}
{"text":"Nice food - nothing extravagant, but overall pretty good quality.  The service was also friendly and nice.  When it gets a little nicer outside, the patios will certainly be well appreciated.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Hemmingway's gets one star for their outdoor patio. They have a big patio in a great location. If you're waiting for friends, it's a good place to grab a beer and watch well-dressed eye candy (whatever your taste) pass by. It's super close to Bay Station (Cumberland exit) so it's convenient. 

However, the service is awful. I have been here plenty of times and given this place many chances. I always have a miserable server, who expects a high tip, despite a lack of charm or enthusiasm. My last server was bored and looked like she may have been on the verge of suicide. Duh, I know people have bad days, but if you can't fake happiness then don't work in the service industry. She got annoyed when we asked her what was on tap (even though she didn't give us a menu) and she took forever with our drinks. 

Beer isn't cheap and food isn't great. I got:
8oz steak and fries for $18.29. The steak was boring and tasted like a heated TV dinner. 
Beet and pear salad for $12.59. My friend got this and refused to share. It looked delicious and if I ever go back, I would order it. She claimed it was good.
Check out their menu online: It actually has a lot of meals that look like they might be good.    http://www.hemingways.to

Hemmingway's is always busy, which I like. Obviously the crowd is different, depending on the day and time. If you want to party with your friends on a weekend, I would avoid Hemmingway's. It's overpriced and far from other bars and pubs. If you want to come here with coworkers on a Tuesday afternoon, then do it. You can afford one drink and a sandwich on a pretty patio. 

Location:
142 Cumberland Street,  Toronto
(416) 968-2828

Subway: Get off at Bay Station (Bloor line). Take the Cumberland Exit. When you exit the Station, Hemmingway's is just accross the street. Look left and you'll see the patio!"}
{"text":"Hemingway's will never change. And that's a good thing. Decent cocktails, mostly passable service, and apparently they serve food which I don't think I've ever eaten. It's sort of an institution, so I'll keep coming back. I really liked my dirty martini and I REALLY liked how they didn't try to upsell the vodka, a huge plus."}
{"text":"I come here a lot. It's the most casual, chill and reasonably priced place in Yorkville. The drinks are reasonable and good. The menu is diverse and very good quality. The service is usually very good, but it gets packed so sometimes it's hard to get someone's attention. Very good value for prices. It's definitely one of my favourite spots."}
{"text":"Went here for a work event with 25+ people in the Shotover Bar portion. We arrived a bit early, and the bartender was clearly annoyed. The service was mediocre at best. 

My bill was 250.00, given we were a large group I assumed the gratuity is added in as normal is so I added an extra 12.00. The bartender approached my entire table and announced that I only gave her a 4% tip. I was mortified. I was a bartender for many years, I understand tips are a big part of your earnings, but never in my entire life would I do such a thing. 

After I gave her a 40.00 tip since I was shamed into doing so she announced to the whole table it was a mistake, but at this point it was over kill and made the situation equally awkward.  In future if she feels so entitled to a tip perhaps she can approach it with more respect, courtesy and discretion. It was an honest mistake

I will never attend another event here with my team again, very disappointed."}
{"text":"From the outside, one can't tell that the place is actually quite big with 2 floors of sitting area. We were seated in an area with plastic tables and balcony chairs. Definitely not comfortable at all. 

Food - Their famous clam chowder was salty; nothing to be amazed about. Hardly any clams, just chopped up veggies. And the worst was the stale bread that was hard and cold. Yuck!! Not worth the $8 and it shouldn't be in the menu. 
I had the stuffed meatballs with spaghetti and surprisingly it came very hot and it was flavourful. So at least they made me happy on this one. My partner had their daily special of jerk chicken lasagna with Caesar salad. Not a great combination and he didn't enjoyed it as much as my own meal. 

Lastly, the service was slow and confusing for around 30mins to have split bills. Other pub-like places do it automatically or kindly without a fuss. 

Verdict. I wouldn't go back unless I'm invited out to a party again. Food is decent but the atmosphere got very loud - for sitting at a corner table."}
{"text":"Hemmingways for lunch today - great service, value and good food.

Hemmingways is not trying to be something they're not - it's a straight forward restaurant/bar with decent food; some \"basics\" as well as other interesting choices, so really something for everyone. The service was excellent, always love the happy Canadians! 

I had the sweet potato and chick pea curry with mango chutney. Served fresh and hot. Good portion.

Probably a good happy hour/sports in the evening."}
{"text":"I'm the kind of person who will eat every last bite on my plate, even if it's just a garnish. So it's no small thing when I say that I left a good portion of my meal at Hemingway's uneaten.

We arrived at around 11:30 to sample the joint's brunch menu. They had all the usual things but they also had something called a New Zealand Bacon & Egg Pie (bacon, eggs, grated onion and green peas, baked together in a savoury pie). I'm always down to try something different, so this was a no brainer.

On the positive side, the home fries were relatively hot and crispy. But the pie... Oh, that pie. First of all (and worst of all), it wasn't hot. And not only wasn't it hot, it was *cold* in parts. I guess they had some leftover from yesterday and they just leave them at room temperature or something?

The egg inside was overcooked to a degree that was shocking, really. It was easily the rubberiest egg I can recall eating. The \"bacon\" inside there was weird and tasteless, and the pie itself was nothing special. Far worse was this odd taste in there I couldn't quite put my finger on; it tasted like something had gone rotten in there, and it was the reason I stopped eating around halfway through.

I would absolutely never return for the food, but the ambiance was nice and it would appear they have a lot of beer on tap. But that pie. My god, that thing will haunt my dreams in the weeks and months to come."}
{"text":"Booked for turkey meal on american thanksgiving day at 7 pm. Arrived 15 min earlier as restaurant asked majority ppl should arrived to not lose seats. Water served and waited for an hour, expected to have nice turkey meal but around 8:10 pm, restaurant told us they ran out of turkey. I sipped water for an hour for nothing and had to look at the menu to chose dish. Was so hungry, one of friends ordered French fries and I filled my stomach with it. Restaurant recommended chicken meal as a substitute so I went for it because didnot want to bother to waste more time to look at the menu. Meal arrived, Caesar salad - nothing special. Meal - I liked the stuffing only. Chicken with gravy, did not like it so I had it with ketchup. Pumpkin pie - was so so. I cannot give more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"I've been to Hemingway's a few times.  I really like the vibe there.  It has 3 different floors each with it's own mood and theme.  

The patio is also nice, especially when the weather is warmer.  It's not super fancy so if that's what you're looking for this is not the place.  However, for a date, snack or a drink this place is very nice, in a good area and not too expensive"}
{"text":"Decided to go here after work today. My friend and I thought the world cup game was today and we thought we would catch the tail end of it. Clearly when we walked in and noticed it was empty we were mistaken. We decided to stay anyways to catch up and chit chat. I ordered the house red wine which happened to be the Malbec Shiraz. I enjoyed it. It was smooth and easy to go down. I have been to places where that wasn't the case.. We also decided to order 1lbs of hot wings which was nicely accompanied with our choice of fries or salad. We decided to upgrade to a Caesar. The food came shortly after and was tasty. The wings were fully cooked and the salad tasted like it should. 

All in all great stop to hit up after a long hard day at the office. Its nice and local which is always great."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance! We went to the top of the roof top bar and had the perfect weather for it. There was a very nice selection of beers to choose from and there were several TVs easily seen from all of the tables playing the NBA finals. 

We ordered some food because we had just arrived in town and were very hungry and didn't want to venture too far from our hotel. I was quite worried based on the reviews for the food below but it wasn't bad at all! Don't get me wrong, its no high-end restaurant, but its good pub food. I had the lamb burger and it was very nice and tender."}
{"text":"So this is your affordable, standard bar in Yorkville. Great spot to grab drinks during the summer if your looking for a patio. Also in the winter they have two heated patios, one to sit on the other to smoke. Food is good came out on a timely manner and server was informative and pleasant. Have been going here for years and would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great for drinks on the rooftop patio, food is not memorable."}
{"text":"The Calamari is awesome but the Quesadilla is terrible - in fact don't think they even know what Quesadilla is!!! :)"}
{"text":"Friendly place/staff.  Good beer collection.  Will go back.  Their heated patios are great for Spring and Fall weather!"}
{"text":"When you let the world know that you are going to serve turkey dinner on Thanksgiving Day, you better be ready for the consequences.  Which is what Hemingway's didn't quite do.  My suggestions:
1.  Schedule more wait staff.  It took a long time for the server to get to our table to take our orders.
2.  What happened to complimentary bread?  Especially when we have to wait around half an hour for our meals.  I was dying of starvation and had to ask the server for something to tie me over until dinner came.
3.  Have enough turkey!  They ran out of turkey by 730pm when the restaurant was packed with diners.   Poor server had to go around the tables to break the bad news and ask diners to pick something else from the menu.
4.  More gravy please!  Some of us were lucky enough to get the last few plates of turkey dinner.  General agreement was that the portion of food was good, but there needed to be more gravy!  Please!"}
{"text":"While staying in downtown Toronto, I enjoyed my meal at Hemmingway's best. I ordered their Hot and Sour Soup and the Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich. The soup was great and the sandwich was perfectly portioned. Many of my fellow diners ordered the Pad Thai and could not stop raving about it. In addition to the wonderful service, a live cover band started to play at 10 pm."}
{"text":"Hemingway's is great for if you're looking for a very busy youthful bar atmosphere right in the middle of one of the swankiest neighborhoods. The patio is killer and always packed - from the middle of summer to the dead of winter, they manage to keep it very comfortable. I've been here several times and never had a bad experience. Staff is friendly, food is a-okay (not amazing, but perfectly fine for the price/area of town/atmosphere)."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you have low expectations but are wowed by the service. The service is fast, amazing and friendly while the food is awesome. I am very impressed by this place and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, hostess was great, food was great (they have the best fries!) but the waitress was unfriendly at best, more like rude and disinterested. Great patio upstairs. Seating is good, wasn't too crowded. TVs to keep tabs on sports. Lots of Cider choices, which makes me happy. Food was quick, which is always nice. All was great except for the unfriendly waitress. Going to go back to try some of the desserts."}
{"text":"My mothership of bars. Beam me home n

3 trips during my week in Yaletown breaks all my rules. Random acts of drunkenness is required in a city of this size. While I did participate in that scenario, I found Hemingway's home. 

After dinner I passed this way and chilled at the bar for a pint or four. The beer was good but what I experienced was a true, neighborhood pub. Everyone knows your name and genuinely asks how you've been. 

The beer is cold, the fish and chips rock out with their cod out and the scene is young old, hip to hip replacement. Everyone comes and all are welcome. Oh, try the Pad Thai too. 

I'm just happy I could experience it. 
Cheer Hemingway's and I'll see you soon"}
{"text":"Strolling through Yorkville looking for somewhere to have an early dinner.
Stumbled upon Hemingways so I decided to give it a go!

There are 3 different floors to this restaurants, The Main Floor / Dining Room, Second Level Smallest of them all with a Bar with Tv's, and Third Floor Patio that is open all year round, heated and covered.

After surveying the 3 I opted for the main floor, just seemed less busy/crowded than the patio and more interesting than the 2nd floor. The crowd here ranges from grey haired men in suits to young females.

The hostess said we could sit wherever we liked and then she'd come over with the menus. After seating ourselves in the back beside the main floor bar along a comfy banquet our waitress Jose returned with the menus. She asked if we knew what we wanted to drink. We inquired if they had sparkling lemonade (I know most restos dont) however she said they have regular lemonade but she could whip of a sparkling one, we asked if she could add strawberry syrup to it (i know a little demanding) she said they didnt have strawberry syrup but she would add strawberry daiquiri mix to it. Anywhoo when she returned with our Drinks, it totally blew me away, she did such an awesome job it tasted delicious!

We were given two menus one was a snack menu with more informal things like pizza, burgers, and appetizer foods and the other was the main menu with dinner items. I was in the mood for a sandwich but I was totally surprised that the dinner menu had no sandwich section! I believe this is the first time Ive never seen a sandwich list on a bar style resto menu! Therefore I opted to go formal and have a proper dinner, I do love fish and they did have good options so I decided to try that route tonight.

For Apps we decided to try something from the Snacks Menu

Cheddar and Potato Periogies with Fried Onions and Bacon and Sweet Potato Fries. The periogies came out piping hot and slighlty golden brown. I liked that they served chunks of bacon instead of bits and side of cold sour cream, traditional but still delicious. The sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly crispy outside and soft inside and I loved the cajun mayo dipping sauce it was served with.

Mains from the dinner Menu

Rosemary Trout - Fillet of rainbow trout with rosemary herb, served with a cherry tomato relish, fresh vegetables, and vegetable rice.
I've never had rosemary on fish before but it tasted excellent! The fish was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed the tomato relish! The rice was simple but still it went well with the fish.

Butter Chicken - Chunks of chicken in a smooth Indian curry sauce, served with steamed vegetables, rice and mango chutney.
My sister didn't like this...she said it was not spicey at all, did not like the mango chutney, nothing outstanding in this dish...

Finally for Dessert
Mississippi Mud Pie - Mocha ice cream on top of a chocolate oreo crumb curst with hot fudge, sliced almonds, and whipped cream.
When the pie came out I realized it was missing the almonds, I alerted our waitress and she explained that they had ran out of almonds (would have been nice to tell us before serving it) however she offered to bring us some chopped peanuts which I agreed to. The pie was really good and I loved the oreo crumb crust and the addition of peanuts made it even more tastier.

Our red rose tea came out piping hot they way I like it with the tea bag already placed in the pot! Good to go!

Overall I believe this place is better suited for drinks and food from the snacks menu. Come with large groups and head up to the heated patio or a casual drink and an appetizer and this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Always a great choice for casual food in the heart of yorkville. Service can be hit and miss but the location is great with large heated patio and consistent good food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, the service was speedy, and everything was delicious! From the time we ordered our food to the time it arrived was so fast, I was almost annoyed I hadn't enjoyed more of my drink first. The specials seemed great with ribs and wings with a Caesar salad and fries for $13! However we opted for appies and drinks, which was perfect for the rooftop patio. Definitely recommend for a place to stop before a night out, or to enjoy the patio"}
