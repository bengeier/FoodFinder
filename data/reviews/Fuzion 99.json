{"text":"I finally checked this place out, after meaning to for quite a while (I live in the area and walk past it on a regular basis, and I always thought it looked interesting). And I was definitely not disappointed!

Yes, they've got live music on weekends, which may not be too everyone's taste, but the music was good, and we also had the best fajitas I'd ever had. Words are not sufficient for how good the food was! And there seemed to be an infectious spirit of fun and energy there, with everyone loudly applauding and cheering the various performers (it seemed to be an open mike night). Once the live music part of the night had finished, there was dance music, and the dance floor quickly filled up. I couldn't resist dancing, even though the friend I'd gone with was a little too self-conscious for that. 

The staff were really friendly and attentive, and I didn't feel at all out of place despite my friend and I being basically the only two non-Latinos there. All in all, a really fun night, and I'll definitely be back! Can't believe I waited this long to check it out, but I'm glad I finally did."}
{"text":"My dinner at Fuzion 99 was a truly baffling experience. I'm not sure what was colder: the food, the sub-zero conditions, or the look the 4 of us received when we placed our 2 TeamBuys on the table. Since there were tumbleweeds blowing through the restaurant (it was empty but for us), we assumed the food would arrive fairly quickly. And as we sat there shivering in our scarves & mittens, we reassured ourselves with the promise of a hot meal. Not only did the food arrive lukewarm, but the entr√©es were served one by one, with at least 5 minutes in between. It was like a dinner relay, where each person had to finish their meal before the next person could eat. While the food was quite tasty and flavourful, it would have been much better had it been hot. Lastly, I wouldn't go here expecting \"Italian-Latin fusion\", as the website suggests. It's essentially Mexican food, plain and simple. The only Italian flair I witnessed was a wine list."}
{"text":"On  Friday night, we were looking forward to going to La Paisa restuarant which according to google is located at this address and instead, we landed at Fuzion 99. Upon entering, we were greeted by the loud music from the live band and a Spanish poetry read that was in progress. The place is more of a lounge than a restuarant. Nonetheless, we ordered a meal. The chorizo that I ordered was charred black on the outside. I wasn't happy eating burned food on a Friday night. Besides, each item on the menu is abive $13 which is overpriced. The food quality I would rank as barfood and poor. The menu sounds fancy but I don't think the restuarant pulled it off. Besides, although they claim the items on the menu are a fuzion,  they seemed more Mexican than anything. Don't understand why it's called Fuzion 99. Overall, I would say nice ambience for a fun friday night, but the quality of food and the prices don't match."}
