{"text":"The food was good enough. The lunasagna was cold and something short of the amazingness that lasagna usually is, but the salad dressing (earthy like tahini) that came with the side salad made up for it . The veggie burger was a large patty between two slices of bread (versus a normal bun) and was also something short of the amazingness that a burger usually is. This isn't a knock on vegetarian cuisine, but rather saying that there's room for improvement.  It was a great place to sit and chill with an (alcoholic) drink and people watch on a rainy day. I would definitely do it again, and save more room for the sweets in the two fridges up front (chia seeding pudding, cookies, macaroons, juices)."}
{"text":"Worst service that I've had in Charlotte to date! I am a native Charlottean and we pride ourselves on good food and southern hospitality. I have been a patron for almost 2 years and I used to love this place. As the faces of the staff continue to change from vibrant, energetic, and fun to blank faced, talkative bar boys and girls, to \"smoothie NON-makers\" who struggle to remember the recipe ingredients, to \"deer in headlights\" managers, I've watched the quality in regard to customer service go down the tube. I waited for close to 7 minutes and eventually had to ask to be helped after being overlooked by not 1, 2, or 3 workers but a whopping 4 servers. How they happened to miss 1 of 2 customers standing in the front of a practically empty restaurant behooves me! I watched 2 servers laugh and joke at the bar for 5 minutes, so this was apparently more important than taking a freaking juice order (how difficult is that?). After waiting and being overlooked for a couple that walked in much later than me, I left without completing my order. Luna's is overpriced and seriously lacking in the quality of servers and respect for customers. They should take an energy shot and change the name to Luna's dead kitchen. I will obviously not be returning...."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was amazing! The food was outstanding. The service was exemplary. We had the Lunasagna and the pad thai. Truly some of the best vegan food these two well traveled people have ever had."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and I was very excited to go to this restaurant for the first time based on the reviews and was disappointed by the end of my meal. The service was slow, the portions were minuscule and the prices were incomprehensible. I paid $6.50 for three miniature sized cookies. The quality of food was good but some of the other factors of a good restaurant were lacking."}
{"text":"Looks great- like a page out of a loft kitchen in Dwell magazine- but often what looks good may not work for the intended function. As a restaurant, the space was not utilized well- a tiny waiting bench area, a bar counter that takes up more space than it offers in function, a small lounge of two chairs and a sofa that- I guess? is for waiting, that could host tables where customers could eat. It makes for a chaotic entryway where people stand or sit around in confusion. The cold, stylish lines of the renovated-warehouse-chic dining area are not kind to sound: one can't hear their friends across the table because of the clatter of commerce and other customers. The result, you both have to speak louder. Then that bounces around, and everyone has to speak louder- and so it goes. It could be fixed with sound dampeners on the ceiling or walls, which could easily be integrated into the look. It's restaurant 101, really. The food. No complaints, really. I didn't enjoy my lunasagna, but that is more of a personal aversion to limp zucchini, and the red sauce of the sundries tomato base was too strong somehow and didn't blend well with the nut cheese on top. I wasn't alone there, one of my group had the same opinion and couldn't finish his. The bill of my group was much higher than I'd expect, and I wonder if when the hipness wears off people will realize they can make the small portions of raw food at home much cheaper, and in a quiet setting."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic.  Let's get that out of the way.  The server had a beautiful smile and was very quick to bring my beverage: a hot chocolate to die for!  I'd recommend the coconut's milk in this for a creamier experience.  While my meal and the service was above all expectations, all of the raw vegetables in the Living Burrito gave me a rough time later in the day.  Digestive science turned a mere 10 oz of food in to 4 gallons of VERY questionable BM.  The toilet at the Babies R Us that I ran into flushed on it's own due to the sheer volume/force.  There was definitely nothing charming about my Charmin that day.  I'd do it all over again, though.  One of the best restaurants in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Charlotte! Vegan or not, this place is for everyone. Fresh, high quality, organic food never disappoints. Great ambience and friendly staff. Good for a quick meal or takeout."}
{"text":"Not a vegetarian or vegan, but this place does It well! The avocado and hummus on collard greens wrap was fantastic and filling. Fresh food that makes you feel good."}
{"text":"Excellent! Everything sounded great, so very hard to chose. Had the veggie burger with side of broccoli Waldorf salad. Delicious.  If I lived closer I'd eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Perfect delicious and healthy food. They provide mostly raw dishes and superb smoothies and juices. It's the place when you look for taste and health. And the peoplea are so friendly."}
{"text":"Unfortunately i had bad experience there.My family is Vegan/vegetarian and i was very excited to check out that place.  I went there with my sister and 5 years old daughter(she is vegan) So we came into restaurant and it was chilly inside so my daughter said she wanted to sit outside ,we asked waitress if we can sit outside and she seated us outside and hand us menus.So we was ready to order but than to our table came other lady and said sorry but you need to leave from here because it is private party starting here in minute and you cant sit here!!!! We was little bit shocked but anyway went inside .Ordered many dishes because wanted to taste and try as much as we can but all dishes was spicy or with garlic.so my daughter couldnt eat any of these.we asked at least to give us plain bread because she was very very hungry .but in 40 minutes what we stayed there they never brought any bred.so we quickly went to other restaurant .So will never come back there,at least with kids..."}
{"text":"So surprised at how I was treated. No greeting, when I sat down in ordered my food got it and that was it. Didn't come over to check on me. Table  next to me got a lil more interaction. Food was alright , but I won't be coming back.  I started wondering what did I do?"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian but I try to follow the restrictions of Pescatarian.   If you're open to eating raw food, Luna's Living Kitchen is the go to restaurant. I've visited a few vegan restaurants in Charlotte but this place taste a lot more like organic vegan food. So why only 4 stars? To raw for me! I'm not a vegan or vegetarian so I do not crave for the taste of raw food. However my meal was very satisfying. My lunch date enjoyed the food as well. He became a vegetarian 12 years ago so he absolutely love this place!! This was his first time at Luna's as well and he really like the food. We sat outside on the patio, ate lunch and enjoyed sharing dessert.   My meal was the LIVING BURRITO Sunflower seed refried beans, cauliflower rice, salsa verde, pico de gallo, onion, sprouts and cashew sour cream wrapped in a collard leaf. Served with a side of our house hot sauce and a local green salad   Date meal was the VEGGIE BURGER Veggie burger is dressed with onion, tomato served on multigrain bread and and salsa verde.  Accompanied by a local green salad.  BERRY CHEESECAKE delicious!!"}
{"text":"I came here to refresh my memory away from the meat and potatoes scene typically seen in the small towns around here, and I loved my food! I ordered the tomato tart. It had a hearty almond crust that had warm buttery flavor! It was filled with a cashew creme and topped with appropriately dressed greens, and a random slice of mushroom. My only complaint is I was under the impression I ordered a tomato tart? It only had two halved cherry tomatoes? I expected more tomatoes for a tomato tart. Also it did take a long time for my food to get to me. I sat solo at the bar. The manager even came up to me and said it will just be a moment longer. Once I got my food I was ignored by the service, so I couldn't ask about the tomato situation? I have it 4 stars because the food was quality and tasted good, but not 5 stars bc the service was not was I anticipated."}
{"text":"Two of the best veggie burgers, two salads, one happy vegetarian girlfriend.   This is one of Charlotte's jewels. If I could cook like this I would go vegan."}
{"text":"For a definite meat eater..... this place and staff have won me over!!  Had the tomatico tart and could not have been more flavorful!  Definitely repeat!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a meal that satisfies a home cooked meal this is the place to go. You can stuff your face all while you are just eating healthy fresh vegan ingredients!   I got the pad Thai, mock tuna, and a side salad! The pad Thai was spicy but delicious and full of flavor. The mock tuna has the texture of an actual tuna sandwich. It is great in the wrap.   I wish I had gotten a dessert but plan on going back tomorrow to grab one :)"}
{"text":"Literally one of the best meals I've ever had, vegan or otherwise. I ate the humus trio, pad Thai, and Cacao Cacao smoothie... All were exceptional and far exceeded my expectations. Even my meat-loving husband was impressed! I wish there was a location close to us, unfortunately we were just visiting from out of state."}
{"text":"I thought it was time to update my review since Luna's moved to the new location.  To be fair, the first review was also five stars - so that should say enough.   The new spot is open, bright, and fresh.  I love sitting at the communal table and usually have a nice tea and work on my laptop.  It's great knowing that at any moment that I get hungry I have an entire menu of delicious food, smoothies, juices, teas ... and now even coffee, wine, or dessert! Great menu expansions, and trust me you will never guess those desserts are vegan.  Luna's consistently maintains their quality and service and keeps the bar raised high as a vegetarian/vegan option in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Sunday morning music should not be loud and top 40. I enjoy breakfast here but every time the music is not appropriate. Food is good."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the worst experience ever last Friday. Seats and cushions are filthy! Food, old stains, grimy! We waited for a very long time until somebody came to our table and took our order. We waited for even longer until the same person told us our food would arrive very soon. After 50 (FIFTY!) minutes, we just got up and left. This story has an even more interesting part than not trying the food at all, even though we were assured we were going to. When we were at the door, our waitress asked us if we had placed our order... What?! She knew we had and said they were very busy that day. They were busy, like normal lunch hour busy, but we're sure that's not the reason why we didn't get our food after 50 (FIFTY!) minutes."}
{"text":"This place is the best vegan Reaturant in Charlotte. It's clean and fresh always. The staff are cool, and the manager is great. The prices are decent, and so are the drinks ! I like this place haha"}
{"text":"I am a meat-loving, protein-consuming guy. However I am also not afraid to try something new, so I gave Luna's a try for a quick lunch. We were in a hurry and they were fast and efficient. For someone like me they had the mock-versions of mainstream food; I ended up getting a burrito in a leafy green tortilla. Everything was absolutely delicious, their chef really knows flavor and taste. Also tried an awesome dessert and they were making many delicious-looking concoctions in the blenders/juicers as well.  The decor is awesome, reminds me of living in a loft apartment, very industrial-meets-modern and perfect for this type of restaurant. Prices were good as well. So maybe I don't need to eat animals every meal..."}
{"text":"Every single thing we got was amazing. You can taste each ingredient in every food. I got the avocado basil sandwich with a side broccoli waldof salad. The salad was sweet and the sandwich came with an enormous amount of avocado. Its on the pricey side but definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Service was lacking, but I arrived at 12:30. Food was simple and tasty. Avocado sandwich and Waldorf salad with water to drink. Decor was nice and bright."}
{"text":"Doing a special diet right now, so we thought we would try Luna's and I have to say we were not disappointed. The food is fabulous and so fresh. I also ordered coffee, though I was a little reluctant because I'm funny about my cup of Joe. I'm thrilled to say it was so good, I had two cups! Love the atmosphere here and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. It's a little pricey, but if you want good fresh food, it's right on track with others."}
{"text":"Great food. Super fresh and delicious and of course completely plant based. Great ambiance and friendly staff--you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"So, the fire and brimstone burger is truly fire and brimstone. It came with guac, red onions, and a lot of cayenne. My favorite part of the meal was the local greens salad. Everything was so fresh! I love micro greens and the Brazil nut \"pesto\" was a nice touch. Smoothies and lasagna are next on my long list of things to try here. Beautiful, clean, well-lit, modern decor. I'll be back. I'll definitely be back :). And I'll sit outside next time! I didn't realize there was a patio!"}
{"text":"So awesome. Much hipster. I have been here multiple times over the last few months in Charlotte and I've practically tried everything on the menu. Love the fire and brimstone burger - best veggie burger ever. I also enjoy the pad Thai, rawco taco salad and the lunasagna  :)  Try the juices and breakfast chia puddings as well!"}
{"text":"I like veggies and such but this was too raw for me. Pad thai was a slaw of vegetables and did not taste anything like the real kind. It was nice to know i could never be a vegetarian- too expensive, got hungry after an hour, and bland. Not to mention my chai was $8 :(.   If you arent a vegetarian, i dont see any reason to go here for their food."}
{"text":"In a town with no true culinary identity..it seems that every joint gets 4 stars or more. In concept this is a great place with a great \"outdoorsey\" feel with its wide-open, big window, red-brick look and all. But lets face it, a bunch of veggies thrown onto multi- or whole grain bread is hardly something to write home about, and the luna bagel is nothing more than a mushy little morsel impersonating an a actual bagel. The smoothies are most excellent (and pricey)"}
{"text":"This place is VERY vegan, but very good as well. The only down side is it does take quite a while to get your food, but its very good.  Real hipster vibe as well if you're into that."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Very creative vegetarian dishes. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I love this place. Such a positive atmosphere and lovely location. This is one of my favorite places to go for breakfast. The biblical breakfast is exactly that. Biblical. A religious experience. I actually find myself craving Luna's. It is feel good and good for you food."}
{"text":"Food was alright, nothing special enough to bring me back.  At the end of my meal, my waitress mixed up my credit card with someone else's, they were the same card so it is understandable.  When I tried to call to talk to a manager about it, they were always busy and never returned my call.  If they are too busy to talk to customers, I'll take my money to someone that appreciates why they are in business."}
{"text":"Love the veggie burger!  Great service, and it was really busy when I was there!! Great job!!"}
{"text":"Excellence.  First time.  Have to come back for a detailed review.  You can tell I'm excited lol."}
{"text":"OMG! I love this restaurant. They have the best raw food I have ever had. I live in Atlanta and come to Charlotte often, this is a must stop before going home. The food is always fresh and almost too pretty to eat. The Pad Thai had me thinking how I could move to Charlotte just to have it daily. This is my favorite feel good restaurant. Since you are opening more locations please consider Atlanta as an option. See you soon."}
{"text":"Our server Sue was wonderful and so was the food. So fresh and healthy. Finally a good place to eat at in CLT."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, this place was a wonderful find. The food is always tasty, fresh, and filling. I would recommend the manicotti, the Fire & Brimstone burger, and the avocado and basil sandwich. That being said, the service is oftentimes verging on horrendous. The hostess is extremely rude, standoffish, and not at all friendly. She also tends to exaggerate the time needed to get a table. Told us 25 mins and we waited 45. She also asked if my party of four would like to \"split up\" and sit at two separate tables so as to be seated faster. Why would I come to lunch with my family, only to be split up with them? I was very confused by that, even though I think she was trying to help? We also waited well over half an hour for our food. Long story short, I will keep coming back because the food is amazing, but they REALLY need to find better service for their delicious restaurant."}
{"text":"I usually love eating here. But today the issue is mostly service related. they were out of a couple dishes and coconut milk. Server  didn't seem apologetic just suggested something else. I placed an order;20 minutes later no breakfast. Finally one of the girls came from the back and asked what I ordered. The server seemed unconcerned. I asked her if they were short staffed today. She shrugged her shoulders and said they were \"just busy.\" The guy who sat down next to me walked out after 15 minutes of no service. The biggest issue is the indifference. They were slow, out off food, and didn't apologize once.  Not typical but hopefully not a trend. The mellow attitude ok for yoga class but epic fail for serving customers."}
{"text":"Loved the space, and the food! Had the portobello falafel and pad thai. Amazing! Cant wait to go back and try the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"The waiter was really nice. The falafel was terrible though. Smelled weird. Everything else tasted pretty okay"}
{"text":"I came here the other day and for the life of me i cant remember the name of what i ordered.  I highly recomend this place if you are a health nut like my self.  i felt so healthy and had so much energy when i left this place!  I cant wait to come back and want to try everything on the menue!!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice - once for breakfast and once for lunch with friends. Both times the food was delicious, gorgeous and filling. It's a little pricey, but so are the ingredients. Everything is made on site and the restaurant itself is a beauty.  Try this place for a deeply satisfying raw and vegan meal."}
{"text":"Best raw/vegan restaurant I have eaten at. I visit often when in the Charlotte area. Have not been disappointed by anything ordered and service is fast."}
{"text":"The smoothies here are amazing, and the staff is really nice.  Haven't been for dinner or lunch, yet, but everytime im in to grab a smoothie or juice, the food looks really good."}
{"text":"On my usial business trip-induced quest for fiber before my flight back to The Big Crapple, my wife suggested I try Living Kitchen (she now insists she didn't, but that's a reflection on our marriage, not the restaurant).    The restaurant is in what looks like a recently Milenn-trified part of town, you know, where they renovate an old factory or warehouse into what is effectively a post-modern mall where the self-conscious bourgeois hyperenlightened masses can bask in luxury while evading micro-aggressions in a wholesome, nonjudgemental safe space.  I ordered the Fire and Brimstone burger and a beet salad.  Both were pretty good, although way short on the fire for a region so famous for its BBQ.  I am sure many other people have commented on the languid service.  I'm not in the free management consulting industry, but I'll offer my keen insight.  The main reason why the service is as laconic as it is, is because customer service is not part of the conception of the business.    The food, decor and even the customer demographic is finely honed, but as a workplace, the vibe is more a relaxed work environment geared to pleasant working conditions than a passionate dedication to excellence.    Surveying the staff, I could not identify anyone that ancient people used to call a manager.  In any case, if you like \"raw\", nutritious bohemian fare and your time is not that valuable to you, you could do somewhat worse than this ultra-contemporary. Yupstaurant."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Its my favourite. The menu is so unique with a combination of fresh greens and veggies. Never knew raw food tasted so good. A lil pricey though."}
{"text":"I want to give it -ve rating. Just bloody buy some packaged salad, sprouts and add some dressing. You know what forget the dressing too. Now pretend you are a fancy goat and eat it. Bingo!"}
{"text":"amazing food and great service! However I had a hard time finding this place. The address and map are completely wrong here on yelp!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic here! Never been where it has not been up to the same standard every single time. I have a hard time convincing those who aren't vegan to try this place, but trust me you will NOT be disappointed no matter what your food preferences are!"}
{"text":"We travel back and forth from NJ to Fla. and back, and we're delighted to find this gem. We have been here twice and both times we were very pleased with our food, the service and the atmosphere. The Pho was great, sushi delicious, the manicotti and lunasagna were great also, but the sauce appeared cooked. . Some advise, don't order a salad because the entrees come with a salad, and they are heavy handed on the sprouts. All in all- it's wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Delicious raw vegan food!!! In heaven!!!  Must try the sweet potato sushi roll.  It was wonderful."}
{"text":"I love my meat and cheese but this place is great!  Took my boyfriend recently and he is a burger guy so totally not his type of place but he enjoyed the pad Thai.  I got the sprout it out salad which was good.  The chai latte with coconut milk was to die for! So good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Charlotte!  I always feel refreshed and renewed after coming here.  Love the esthetic...modern and contemporary, yet comfortable and tranquil.  Love the light fixtures, artwork, pillows, etc. Staff are always top notch.  It's an oasis.    Lots to choose from on the menu.  A few favorites are the Pad Thai with zucchini and sweet potato noodles and the Avocado Basil sandwich.  The Biblical Breakfast is awesome...artisanal bread topped with peanut butter, almond butter, fig jam, banana...so delicious and satisfying.  I could have that everyday.  Love the drinks too...kale lemonade, smoothies, lavender cappuccino,etc.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It's amazing to see a vegan/raw type restaurant so busy! Even though they were slammed the service was still superb, food came out fresh, fast and eye appealing. Such a creative and delicious menu. Followed my pad Thai (veggie 'noodles', fresh colorful veg, house made almond butter Pad Thai sauce and a spicy sambal sauce (ask for extra if you like spicy!). Followed up with a latte made with Larry's Beans and house pressed coconut milk. They served breakfast as well"}
{"text":"If vegan eating is your thing, this is probably the best of two purists' choices in Charlotte. I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, but I do enjoy a totally guilt free, no concerns about ordering healthy, type of dining experience. Most of the items on the menu are raw, but not all. I ordered a coffee that I just couldn't drink, because of the alternative milk concoction that I had optimistically tried. The waitress was completely understanding and removed it from my bill. Bring your fat wallet. It's not for those on a budget, but the quality is clearly top shelf, local, organic and quite tasty."}
{"text":"Great healthy food with a nice, modern vibe that has a slightly rustic twist. The staff was an absolute delight!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Charlotte for the weekend, we hopped at the chance to visit this restaurant! We ordered the tricolor hummus as our appetizer, both of us really enjoyed the lemon parsley hummus especially, the other two were different but still appetizing. He ordered the mushroom pizza and I ordered the Pad Thai, both were extremely  well made!  The only issue was the service in my opinion. Our server was flirting with a girl most of the time, and would avoid our table most of his rounds, we knew what we wanted and it took about 20 minutes until our server came by to get our order. I was a server for many years so it's easy to recognize these things. Anyways, the food was delicious- the cook was amazing (and she was the only one back there preparing all the meals on a Saturday evening) I would have loved to give this place 5 stars, hopefully on our next visit we can!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Pricey but worth it once in a while. Beautiful space too. I love having a vegan restaurant in South End!"}
{"text":"I visited the Living Kitchen last evening for the first time and the food was great but the service was very bad. We were seated and a woman visited the table with two glasses for water and their water dispenser and left. She disappeared. We sat for a while until we were assisted and the hostess that had seated us asked us if we were ready to order after we sat for quite a while. There were about 4 other tables with patrons and the place was quiet and not busy so I am not sure why the service was so slow. I noticed there were two women at the table across from us that were acting frustrated waiting for their bill and to pay but it appeared the workers present, other than the kitchen chefs that were busy, were just not being productive and not acting like they cared there were customers present that needed assistance. Seemed kind of like a \"kiddie\" place for employees who were not caring about doing a nice job for their employer......"}
{"text":"Note: this is only a review of the Southpark location. I eat at Luna's 2-3 times per week, but am becoming disheartened and frustrated. I don't want to take my business elsewhere so hopefully someone in management will see this!!  While I LOVE the concept of Luna's and want to support their efforts to sell clean, organic food, I believe a few things need to change BADLY:  1. Better management: when more than a quarter of the restaurant is full, the wait staff struggle. It often takes 15-20 minutes before I get water, and another 15 before I can order.   2. I often order over the phone (2-3 times per week), and I usually have to call 2-3 times before someone answers. Every time I give the benefit of the doubt and assume they are busy and can't answer. Not the case.  At all. There was one customer to 4 employees when I walked in!  3. Portions are starting to get skimped on. For $7.50 you can fill the chia pudding beyond a small half cup.   4. I had a screw in my turmeric latte. Yes, a screw! I barely got an apology and then was asked to bring the screw back.  What kind of customer service is that? I'm sorry you have college kids running the place, but someone needs to teach them customer service skills for the price people pay to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Tasteless Overpriced....very overpriced.  Terrible salad dressings collection.   Not sure how you are in businesses!!  I careless for your food, taste, pricing, service,  spices / seasoning used.  Good luck! ( a veggie wrap and a drink...$22.00 ..no thanks )"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!!!! The menu is a bit interesting, but very trendy and healthy. Love the atmosphere and service was decent. Got our food pretty quickly. I recommend to try it out and try something new. Vegans would love it. The total experience is what sold me."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten here and both times I've walked away impressed.  The first time I had lunch and the BBQ sliders were AMAZING.  Today my wife and I enjoyed a Saturday morning breakfast on the brick patio.  The ambiance is awesome with a canopy of trees, lush landscaping and the soft sound of waterfalls.  My wife had the biblical breakfast and it was a huge delicious serving (I helped her finish) and I had the Swiss Bircher Muesli.  My portion was smaller but adequate and full of fruitful flavor.   The coffee is top notch and my wife had the golden milk which tasted like something you'd drink on vacation. Amazing breakfast experience.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Overall, fairly good restaurant. We knew going in that it was a vegan restaurant, but we somehow overlooked the fact that it is also mainly raw - which can be a hard combination for some people (most of the food is cold and doesn't contain wheat). I had the avocado, basil, and tomato sandwich (one of the few items containing wheat) with the Caesar salad, both of which were tasty and satisfying. My husband had the veggie burger and broccoli waldorf. Unfortunately, the burger didn't look like a burger at all since it was served on regular whole grain bread without any of the condiments that normally accompany a burger. It was really just a sandwich.The broccoli waldorf was just ok. The prices of most items were reasonable, but the drinks seemed to be priced very high. The \"fresh\" fruit juices (which we found out were not actually made fresh that day) are $10.   The service was very friendly. Overall, it was a good experience but there just weren't a lot of things that you can really sink your teeth into (which is the main reason we eat out) - it seems more like diet food."}
{"text":"I went with a group of ladies for lunch today and just saying the raw vegan classic burger was a WOW. Trendy, modern, bright and ALIVE, with food to match!"}
{"text":"Very impressed. The food, the atmosphere, the service were all excellent. I will definitely be back to Luna's."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is a Vegan's heaven. It's called living kitchen for a reason. All the food is alive. Barely cooked and it tastes amaizing. The decor is beautiful, the service excellent, the little details are genius. First, they serve water in a cute glass pitcher at room temperature. The menu is simple, but fabulous. I describe it as a Disco Party. Our appetizer was the sweet potato sushi served with a yummy dipping sauce and chopsticks, so cute. I was AMAIZING! Then for entree I had the Pad Thai. A burst of flavors spaghetti style sweet potato, squash and who knows what the hell else. It was so good I ate it so fast I did not have time to look at it. I also had a side of broccoli salad. OMG. It tasted like chicken salad. Exquisite. My husband had the squash lasagna with salad also served cold but it was great. He had to order a side of the brocolli salad because I was not willing to share. The deserts came and BOOM! a hit. I had the dark chocolate and coconut pudding with berries and it was a burst of flavor in my mouth. My hisband had the chocolate cake and it was like a disco party all over again. It was our aniversary and even though my husband is not Vegan he loved the food and the place. But, beware great  food comes with a cost."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  I am on a raw food diet and their food is amazing.  Their salads are great and very filing.  The mint-to-be smoothie and turtle cake are also favorites of mine.  I definitely recommend Lunas!"}
{"text":"This place is a vegan's paradise.  It's located in a hip little spot in Atherton Mill.  Upon walking in, I noticed the place was clean, airy, and very inviting.  I would love to sit and eat here, even by myself, if I wasn't just picking up an order I had placed over the phone.  Note, they also take online orders through Postmates for delivery, or through their website for pickup only.  Not once did I feel guilty eating this food, not matter how indulgent or creamy it might have tasted.  They did end up forgetting to put the cake I ordered in the bag and I didn't notice til I got back to my hotel... but they refunded me after I called and I took it as a sign that I wasn't supposed to be eating sweets anyways, ha!  For a light appetizer, I had the \"Vietnamese Pho\" which really isn't anything near Vietnamese or authentic at all.  If you ignore that part, this is a nice, light, decently flavorful, spicy clear broth soup with loads of vegetables and a little bit of kelp noodles.  Great kick and good if you're craving some hot soup.  As my entree, I had the Living Burrito.  YUM.  I love that it's wrapped in collard greens which were incredibly fresh and had no sign of dirt or holes or anything.  It's got quite the mushy filling with the \"refried beans\", cauliflower rice, cashew sour cream, pico de gallo, and guacamole, but it's some of the best mush inside a collard green wrap I've ever had - not that there's anything to compare it to, haha.  It had plenty of flavor and I loooooved the house hot sauce it came with as well as the little green salad.  Luna's also serves a massive list of juices and smoothies.  I will definitely be eating here again, versus the same old boring salad joints.  It's not the cheapest thing in the world, but at least you feel clean eating it."}
{"text":"A REAL treat! Unique vegan fair with expansive menu of hard to say no to options. This was our first visit and I pleased, we arrived at 11pm and sat on the porch. Service was a little on the slow side but our waitress was very polite and got our checks fast. We had the sweet potato sushi (delish!) and had the pad thai as well as the fire and brimstone burger. Both  were very spicy and we wouldn't change a thing!"}
{"text":"Charlotte is lucky to have a raw, organic, vegan restaurant. Not only is it affordable, it's fantastic. I've been too many times to count and while the service is hit or miss, the food is consistent. My goal is to try everything at least once. Yes, everything is cold. It's raw. There is something precious about local and organic food that connects us back to nature. If you're used to fast food, or heavily salted/sweetened things, this will take some getting used to. But for others who have a more down to earth palette will appreciate the love and care put into each dish and the amazing flavors from simple foods that I could never make for myself in my kitchen. The only con is that they're closed on Sunday.  Fav breakfast: Hola Granola with hemp milk Fav lunch: Caesar salad (those kale croutons oh my gosh) with a side of cranberry/walnut bread and nut butter. Fav dinner: Living burrito with local green salad. Fav dessert: Turtle cake (very small but it's very rich).  I hope Luna's is around for a very long time."}
{"text":"Food ok but basically a way to charge high dollar for cheap ingredients and almost no cooking labor required"}
{"text":"The food is so fresh and flavorful!  I had the broccoli Waldorf salad - very crunchy with a great taste!  My husband had the fire and brimstone veggie burger with chipotle hummus  - nice kick and great flavor :). We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So. Good. The food was incredible! I got the pizza, which was my favorite entree. The cashew cheese is outta this world. The roasted cauliflower Rosemary soup is the best soup I've ever had. I also got to try the Mint to Be smoothie and it was great! I got the BBQ sliders bc why not and they were very tasty. Absolutely perfect overall.   The service was quick and fantastic! I ate alone and my bartender made the whole meal enjoyable from start to finish."}
{"text":"Ummmm....yummmmm....that is the best way for me to start with this review.  Luna's certainly exceeded my expectations with my first visit!!!  The atmosphere was lively as soon as we walked through the door! We were promptly greeted...added to the wait list and given a reasonable time for a table.  The wait allowed us to observe and talk about food...and restaurants...and was seated in no time.  Our table located near the large bright windows overlooking the Blue Line....so great view of the outside and the view of the restaurant.  OK...back to the ...ummmmmm .....yummmmmm!  We spent some time reviewing the various selections...of appetizers and then the entrees...and the great specialty drinks.   The decision on the appetizers were promptly made and later I knew why we could not settle for just one!!  The Falafel Sampler was simply amazing.  The flavors of the falafel were like none I have ever tasted.  The olives...coated nicely in a very nice pesto were so good.  So the debate started...which were better....olives or falafel?  Well...it was a toss up.  So time to move on to try the carrots and cauliflower!  OK...so now this is why they say \"homemade\" pickles.  Oh these veggies had been pickled in a nice vinegarette...that added enough zing to cleanse the palette before returning to the olive v. falafel challenge.  Ohhhh ummmmmmm....yummmmm!  Just too good to pronounce a winner!  In the meantime...just a few more minutes to review the entrees...and sample the drinks.  The \"ginger ale\" was just spicy enough and effervescent and fizz to quench your thirst. Very nice ginger ale! Had I tasted the ginger ale prior to having the kale lemonade...I may have had both!!!  (see photos) They were very good and tasty!!!  and went well with the appetizer.   Entrée time.....So what is the recommended favorite of the day.... well after finishing the nice portioned appetizer...you are almost tempted not to order any entrée...but the Rawco Taco Salad drew top bid...and was the selection.  And let me tell  you.... uummmmmm....yummmmm!!!  Just a great salad that was so beautiful that it looked like a work of art!  (see photo).  Everything arranged so perfectly for taking just a small amount of each ingredient to sample from this huge salad.  OK...as I paused just to admire such a great salad...I was quickly prompted to try the walnut almond crumbles and sour cream sitting nicely in front of the fresh sprouts (OK...will get to those later)  So...the forkful of walnut almond topping just drove my taste buds crazy.  And...then I was prompted to try it with the raw crackers that were made with sesame seeds .....ohhhhhh so so so good! I am thinking...can a salad get better than this...well it got better.  The pico de gallo had a surprise blast of heat from the peppers....so yummy....the avocado...with spices so very good...and all of this sitting on top of an amazing fresh crunchy bowl of greens!!!  Now the sauce....just a nice little ramekin of goodness...with a little sprinkle of sesame seeds on top....but the flavor was so good.  I had to keep tasting trying to figure out how you make such great flavors......ummmmmm yummmmm!!!! Now we are asking \"where is this chef so we can give some high fives and kudos\"!  And just as we wrapped up the salad (big enough for 2) pondered whether we had had enough....as we searched the front and back of the main menu searching for desserts.  Our server...nice as she could be...graciously mentioned her favorites from the separate menu she provided..... and this was minutes after we spent a few minutes talking about chocolate upon chocolate...and who liked carrots....and halwa....and pudding and other decadent desserts to compare to what was on the menu!!!  Decision time....my lunch partner left it all up to me....and... easy decision.... Who can resist chocolate upon chocolate upon chocolate infused with garnacha?  Not at this table.  So....Dulce de Amor was the easy choice.  so...ohhhh my \"sweet love\" or my \"love of sweet\"!  Just the reaction as I looked across the table and observed the expression as just a nibble was sampled.  Goodness.....goodness...goodness...when it comes to great food...there is no lying in the eyes and the smile. When the eyes close....you know that the dessert has taken you to another place!!!!  Yes...the eyes close...maybe to see pecans being mixed with chocolate...and drizzled with raspberry couli!!!  It is rare that restaurants are good enough to push anything out of my top 5....well... Luna's is that rare find!!!  Thank you PG for great recommendation...and sharing this great experience!!!"}
{"text":"We came over after a hot yoga session. I got the flying Lucy smoothie and my friend got the ogre which she loved!!!!  We also got the tri color humus appetizer that were amazing. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wait time: 20 minutes.  Service: pretty good, it was busy and there was only two servers so understandable that we didn't get checked on a ton.  Food: AMAZING! My friend and I both got the pinko drinko smoothie and the server made sure that bee pollen (which isn't vegan) was okay with us. It was delicious!! Highly recommend. For our entrees we got the avocado basil sandwich on multi grain bread, with a local greens side salad. So good! The bread was toasted and the sandwich was delicious and filling. The salad was also great! Price was fair for the amount of food. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It was so clean and the decor amazing.  I was a bit apprehensive about trying raw food.  Wrong, it was simply delectable. The ginger juice wow! Definitely will be back again soon."}
{"text":"This place, menu, people and vibe are all so beautiful and healthy. They were giving out fresh juice samples at the Free People down the alley so we decided to stop it. So refreshing!  The only reason I'm giving a 4 out of 5 is because the to go juices are in trendy glass bottles but they don't take the bottles back for reuse or recycle."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Luna's. I have had their juices and love them! Sadly I was extremely disappointed. I sat down and told the server I had a gluten allergy and asked if they had gluten free bread because I wanted to try a sandwich. He replied he's so I went ahead and ordered the avocado & Basil sandwich. When the food got to the table I was anxious to eat, it looked amazing. After eating part of the sandwich the server came over and informed me the bread I was eating was not in fact gluten free. He had messed up my order. He apologized and asked if he could get my food remade. I said sure but also slightly started to freak out (haven't eaten gluten in two years). The manager came over and apologized and asked if I needed anything. The server brought me my new order to-go and I ordered a smoothie. He then brought me my check. I got extremely sick and I'm not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Better than I thought super healthy vegan would be and so flavorful!"}
{"text":"I live in a city just outside of Toronto where there aren't many vegetarian or vegan restaurants. So whenever I travel, I like to search for nearby vegetarian/vegan places to eat or drink! I was happy to know that Living Kitchen was nearby and was soooo happy with what we ordered!   We ordered the Living Bagel, Mint to be smoothie and Zinger juice. Loved all of them! Everything was light, fresh and healthy! You could taste all the ingredients in the smoothie and juice, both so refreshing! We also loved the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant, very warm and welcoming. It would be a perfect spot to get some work or studying done!  I really wish there were more places like this closer to where I live! (It's not exactly the best drive to get to Toronto and even worse to drive in) Job well done!"}
{"text":"wish I could give a 3.5 but opted to round up because you can't get this food just anywhere. Being vegan is hard when you want to eat out and still get nutritious food. Eating at lunas, you can tell everything is super fresh. The veggie burger was ok, a little dry. The mock tuna and avocado basil sandwich were very good ! The hummus trio was good (curry was my fav), but with the quantity of dipping options they give you (cucumber, carrots, crackers) youd need 3 orders of the hummus to use on them. It wasnt even enough for my toddler. At first i thought they brought just the veggies/crackers separate from the hummus.. then i noticed the tiny melon scooper sized hummus balls in the bowl.  The caesar salad was also really yummy. I would say the price you pay and the portion size don't match up. From other reviews I see, it seems I'm not the only one to feel this way. But the food was pretty good, and again, you can't get this food just anywhere so I understand the pricing, but there needs to be a little more food for the price ranges."}
{"text":"Love Luna's! Best juices in town and great vegan desserts. The food is good if you're into the vegan thing but they serve zero meat so be aware of that!"}
{"text":"Our family went for lunch on a Saturday and I am so glad that we found this place.  Our waitress was wonderful about making recommendations and we were all pleased with our choices.  I had the living burrito with a side of the split pea soup and both were fabulous.  We ordered two different desserts to share, but the lemon berry cheesecake was the hands down favorite.  Also, our waitress was kind enough to bring us a sample of the hemp milk since we had never tried it.  Just in case you haven't either; it's delicious.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My FAV Vegan  Raw Restaurant in Charlotte so far. Just wish they had more options. I Love this place from the open lighting floor plan to the friendly and attentive staff.  I came at lunchtime and the place was pretty busy, the only available seating was at the bar and at tables with stools. However being pregnant I asked to sit on the couch and await one of the tables with cushioned seating to come available while I check out the menu. The hostess agreed and as I waited I watched several people come in for pick ups as this place does pretty good from what I observed. My table become available a short 5-10 mins after I sat to wait.  The hostess sat me and I immediately ordered the sweet potato roll as I read all good things and a Green juice. Once it came out I devoured the roll it was so yummy I mean super yummy  and the sauce was pretty perfect as a compliment to the roll.  I went on to order a Avocado sandwich minus the sprouts as I can't have sprouts pregnant. The sandwich was yummy the only complaint I have is that the bottom bread was about 4times smaller than the top so I couldn't eat it like a sandwich as I observed others who ordered the sandwich eat it. Instead I had to eat it with a knife and fork.  My server was awesome I believe her name was Sasha she was very informative and attentive. I'll be back as there is another item I wanted to try that I just couldn't consume on this visit."}
{"text":"Exceptional vegetarian food! The veggie burger is delicious & served hot with guacamole and crunchy grain bread. Amazing sweet potatoes, side costs extra but wonderful food.  My other new obsession is their pear and gorgonzola (cashew milk based) pizza. It's more of a flatbread but the pear and the cheese are divine and the parmesan adds a bit of a variety. I'm seriously obsessed with this dish! I've ordered it three times in two weeks!!   Also let me state I'm not a vegan but the food is genuinely delicious. I am lactose intolerant so I'm excited for all things dairy free.  Their turtle cake is phenomenal for chocolate & carmel flavors with pecans and fresh berries!  They're behind the building near the WF bank at south park mall. It's the old restaurant  Zebra's location for those of us in town for over ten years. Parking is in the lot or deck."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. This is the first time my husband had no complaints at a restaurant since I've known him. Great service. Amazing food. With my non-vegan standard American diet lovin parents and they LOVED the food and the atmosphere.  Ordered the tuna sandwich, falafel appetizer, pho soup, sweet potato sushi, burgers, a salad, - tiramisu and lemon berry cheesecake.  Everyone was happy."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times to get a juice when going to the mill. I haven't been to the bigger space, but it would take about 20 minutes to order one drink.  Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"I Love this place PERIOD. I can only say a couple not to awesome things about this place which I'll start with before getting to all the awesomeness that outweigh the couple things that wasn't so good. My couple bummers: - The location being located is tricky as it's sorta hidden and the parking lot is shared with other places and getting a spot during high traffic times  - The overwhelmed (and it shows) staff during lunch hours who can't handle the crowd (experienced this 3 times) - The fact that they run out of FRESH juices early like by 1pm and don't close until 9 and the juices are on the menu.  Ok to the awesomeness: The space is so environmentally friendly, welcoming and bright. The staff upon entry are very welcoming and nice. The food, juices (when they aren't sold out) and smoothies are tasty. My FAV items as well as my family FAV items (included) are as follows : The Vegan sushi roll - The Roll is light, yummy and fresh and the sauce is the perfect compliment  Almond Butter bread with the cranberry walnut bread The multi-color hummus with cranberry walnut bread, cucumbers and carrots  The BLT The BBQ sliders  The Avocado sandwich   Living Kitchen doesn't fail in the areas expressed. Yum"}
{"text":"What an excellent find.   The plates are absolutely beautiful and taste as good as they look.  Decor and staff are up to the task.  Loved it!!   We aren't from Charlotte, but anytime we are flying in or out of CLT, we make time for a stop here!"}
{"text":"My companion and I went to Living Kitchen on an impulse and am very happy to say it was delicious and worth it! My companion got the Arugula Harvest salad and I got the Pad Thai. The Arugula Harvest salad was very tasty and all of the components came together well. The Pad Thai was also very flavorful and had an awesome sauce which had a good afterburn to it. I would highly recommend coming here to try the food vegan, vegetarian, or otherwise."}
{"text":"I'm definitely an omnivore but if I could eat at Luna's everyday I would consider giving up meat all together! The space at Luna is comfortable and clean with little touches of color. The smoothie and coffee bar are directly in front of you as you enter. The smoothie, Juice, and speciality drink menu looked fantastic with offerings such as the zinger (beet, Apple, orange, lemon), the Popeye punch (spinach, Apple juice, pineapple, banana, hemp protein), and the dirty chai (chai latte with a double shot of espresso), but for this visit, I wanted food! I asked my friendly waitress for her recommendations. She suggested one of the items that I had my eyes on: the Living Burrito, a combination of sunflower retried beans, cauliflower rice, guac, pico de gallo, onion, tomato, sprouts, and cashew cream. All of this goodness was wrapped in a collard leaf with the local green salad and a side of the house hot sauce. I placed my order, took a couple of pictures then BAM, my food was ready! No cooking involved so it was super quick! My food was delicious and flavorful. I felt satisfied after finishing the burrito but could not leave this place without trying the key lime pie. The pie was bright, refreshing, and the perfect end to my meal. I spoke at length with my waitress about the food, she answered all of my questions and seemed to have a great understanding and knowledge of the menu. Check this place out if you're looking for a quick and healthy meal."}
{"text":"So many delicious vegan choices. The collard wrap is wonderful. Try everything it is so good and a beautiful setting as well."}
{"text":"My all time favorite & healthiest restaurant in Charlotte!! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu but start with the Volcano juice or any of their smoothies! They recently added a new mushroom pizza and a \"BLT\" made with mushrooms instead of bacon and it tastes exactly like I was eating a regular BLT!! I will definitely get them again but my usual go to is the fire & brimstone veggie burger which nothing can beat. Try their made in house hot sauce with it and for dessert, get the lemon-berry cheesecake!! Everything is a must try even if you aren't plant-based!"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try this place for awhile now and glad I finally got the opportunity. We got the chili special, lunasagna with side salad and fire and brimstone burger. Everything was delicious with the salad dressing stealing the show. Seriously...I'm not sure what it was, but it tasted similar to ranch. I was skeptical that I'd like the raw lasagna, but the cashew cheese was expertly flavored. We even used some of it on the burger that was a tiny bit dry. Great meal overall...we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing else like it in Charlotte.  The best juices and living food within 100 miles.  I was quite dismayed when I pulled up today and Luna's was no longer there.  Then I turned around and saw they just moved across the parking lot.  A much better location with more outdoor seating.  Still the same love being put in to all the juices and drinks.  So many amazing options to choose from, but this time I just went with the chillied chai.  I should have gone for a berry smoothie, after I tried somebody else's, but no complaints on my end.  My chai was smooth and almond milk creamy.  Just the little kick I needed to continue my day.  Not to much to tell ya on this one as I didn't get any food, but will be back soon!"}
{"text":"As a new Vegan it was underwhelming.. The expectations were far from what the food actually was. Us Vegan newborns need better descriptions/pictures.. Also VERY expensive compared to other Vegan restaurants we've visited. I don't quite understand the $$ cost rating.. Excellent service though."}
{"text":"Food tasted great! I got the avocado and basil sandwich wrapped in a collard leaf and my bf got the pad Thai. Both tasted bomb. The cauliflower rice is really good alone but I added the tahini dressing to it and it taste really good. The almond milk drink is really good and smooth. I will be returning"}
{"text":"This place is located in the perfect spot to get a bite to eat after shopping. We stopped in after Black Friday shopping and were pleasantly surprised of the friendly ambiance and vibe. The menu had lots of options for those who are vegan + gluten free (like me). I started with the kale lemonade, so delicious, thirst quenching and an energy booster. I also had the soup of the day which was rosemary cauliflower and it was divine. Then I had the mushroom and broccoli pizza, which was insanely good but insanely small. Felt like I took four bites of it and was done. Sad, because I wanted more. My husband got the brimstone burger and a side of spice slaw. His was good but super spicy dish all around, but at least his was more filling than mine. So to suffice I got two desserts (did I mention I was very hungry). I got the chocolate pudding (recommended for serious chocolate lovers) was rich and perfect and I got the dulce cake which was fantastic with a raspberry compote. I also had a dirty chai latte with coconut milk which was a nice pick me up but a fun spin with ginger and peppercorn to add some extra spice. Didn't taste too much chai though. Overall it was tasty but wish the portions were more fulfilling so I wouldn't have had to order half the menu to be satisfied."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! Seriously. I may not leave. Amazing breakfast and smoothies. Comfortable seating. Awesome staff (Emma had great recommendations). Free WiFi. Motivating playlist. All boxes checked.   The tart was a very filling breakfast. The Yola Mango was a thick macha mango dream child.  I'll be back to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Everything I have eaten here has been wholesome perfection!"}
{"text":"What a yummy place! The inside is gorgeous; very white, natural light heavy and beautiful wooden tables. Easy to fall in love with. Having spent time in Portland, this is as close as charlotte comes to the Portlandia, vegan, all natural/organic food trends.  I did not sit at a table; I opted for my salad to go. It was very busy around 2pm on a Saturday afternoon for lunch; always a good sign!  Things are pricey, but that is to be expected because they are using such fresh + local ingredients. There's so much I want to try upon coming back in. Unfortunately, since this is a vegan joint, many things are made with nuts which isn't ok for me because I'm allergic. But there are some nutless things on the menu.  I got the sprout it out salad (sans Brazil nut Parmesan) which was tasty. Avocados are nice and creamy, and the spiralized  root vegetables are a nice compliment (however it will only be one root vegetable; not a variety). I loved the hemp seed dressing; that was the real winner in my opinion. I love hemp seeds to begin with so creating a dressing with their extra protein is a huge plus. Overall, my salad was good (not out of this world amazing) but I definitely know what I want to order next time in!"}
{"text":"Although, I love the food at the Living Kitchen, the service does not support how great the food is. I went to the new location near my home on Sharon road. I decided to place a take out order. The woman at the bar could not make any suggestions about what I would like even though I asked her what her favorite was. She brought me my food on a plate as if I was dining in even though we had a discussion about me taking it home to relax. I ordered the fire and brimstone veggie burger that is absolutely delicious, but she never suggested anything to accompany it. I told her I wanted a chocolate dessert, and not until I picked the brownie in the fridge, and looked at the menu did she agree with me that the pudding would be richer. On top of it all when I corrected her about my wanting takeout she put my food in the bag and handed it to me and said thank you and goodnight. I had to remind her that I had not paid. I will go back, because I love the food, but I hope they put someone more present and charismatic at the bar."}
{"text":"Amazing, the food is inspired and delicious, I bring non-vegans all the time and they love it.   The price is a bit expensive and service too often off or wonky, the restaurant is generally too cold or too hot-- whatever is less desirable. I drive from the triangle to come here, I adore this restaurant more than almost any other one I have been to. I often wish they expanded the menu or did more specials and warm dishes"}
{"text":"I'd definitely recommend to vegans and vegetarians.   I've been to several Living Kitchens and have enjoyed them all. This has the distinction of being the first all vegan one I've been to. While that made it ideal for me, it may not be right for groups of meat eaters.   We had the sushi, manicotti, burger and two salads. The burger was great. It held together well and had tons of flavor. The manicotti was made with cucumber and delicious nut cheese. This held together better than a lot of the other similar dishes I've had, which was a big bonus."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Found this traveling back from a job in SC. Fresh and the flavors will make your tastebuds jump around. Had the living burrito, light and I feel great, finished with the orge smoothie. Yes to more of these in the country!!!"}
{"text":"This is so awesome they are now in Southpark. The food is outstanding and they have a few new items in the menu. Service was as I expected, spot on. Had the mushroom kale salad with a side of falafel and kombucha. Living kitchen again delivers and helping me live my organic vegan life"}
{"text":"Yum on so many levels. From granola to their bars, alternative-milk yogurts, smoothies, and even wine, Luna's is great.  The indoor space is comfortable, immaculate and service is very good.  They have an awesome outdoor area on the rail trail that is pretty quiet (except when a train passes for honestly 2 seconds) so it's a nice change of pace on that patio space versus other outdoor dining areas in Charlotte.  I will say, I wish they would get a little bit on the macro train and list the breakdown of carbs/fats/proteins on their menu. They focus really on clean, natural, gluten free, vegan flavors, which i TRULY appreciate on so many levels, but at the very least, I feel like this should be a standard here to go a step further of inclusive dietary lifestyles so I don't have to eyeball how many grams of blueberries are going into my smoothie. (or submit the menu to My Fitness Pal and they'll do it for you!)"}
{"text":"I love this place. The location is a little bit strange and I've seen restaurants come and go from here, but nonetheless this place is fantastic. It feels like there is love and care put into everything. The staff is friendly here and the atmosphere is calming; minimalist design and the large windows are lovely (the massive post-modern painting, however, is hideous). The food is beautiful, colorful and fresh. The combinations sound odd on the menu, but what's served to you is completely cohesive. This place isn't exactly kid-friendly or for people sensitive to spice, that's my only warning. We plan on making this a regular spot of ours! My only complaint is that we were filled in on a rewards program offered by this restaurant and I received an email confirming that we were enrolled. However, our last 2-3 visits haven't been honored, and I was sure to write down my email on the merchant copy of the receipt and let the wait staff know. Why the inconsistency? Otherwise, great place."}
{"text":"It really is a great place. Very healthy food and completely vegan, If you go for lunch it will be a little bit crowded. The place is very easy to find and the parking lot is good. The patio is great and you can bring your dog. You can also take the light rail and skip the traffic."}
{"text":"Loved this place @ Atherton Mills and even better now that it's closer to home! Zinger juice is my favorite ... highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I am in town for a few nights staying at the Marriott Renaissance in SouthPark - searching out for something healthy last night and found Luna's. Had the Lunasagna and Falafel - fantastic!!! Going back AGAIN tonight for the Rawco Taco and Berry Cheesecake. And I am not even a vegetarian! Just good food!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a different experience Luna's living kitchen will deliver that. Luna's living kitchen makes vegan food that will change your perspective. I've been coming here a while and i love when i have a Luna day. From the juices to entrees you can't go wrong with Any menus item ! Highly recommend!!!!!!!!! (Obsessed with there cold press juices ) !!!! Like obsessed"}
{"text":"Two words: FUCK       YES.   I love everything about this place. The food is GREAT. So glad I stumbled upon it. I can't wait to get back here and try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Great concept and food. Service sucks plain and simple. This is my third location going to, and the best one all around is on South Blvd.   Someone needs to keep an eye on the door when there is no host. I waited for at least 3 minutes. Not a server in sight.. The bartender softly spoke from behind the bar finally- \"dining in or out\" and that I could seat my self. Good thing I grabbed a menu! Waited for at least 5 mins before a server came over and they were only interested if I was ready to order. Never checked on me once food was out.  Had to ask for my check. The restaurant was not busy at all. My server had maybe one other table. Just simple steps of service needed here.   Such a great place, but when you want to leave right after you walk in doesn't make the best experience!   I had the new pizza on the menu and it was decent. It would also be great if this place had black napkins! Because now I have lint all over my work clothes :/"}
{"text":"Knowing what your getting yourself into at this place is key. They are a raw, vegan restaurant that is mostly gluten free. Gotta be in the mood for a healthy plate of veggies, vs. a carb or meat bomb.  First time at the new location and second time visiting and we had a nice experience. Again, cause this time I knew what I was getting myself into. Throughly enjoyed the living burrito with the garden salad. The ingredients are treated with so much respect that your plate of food is almost like a mini work of art.   The husband ordered the pad thai and thought it was good, although it was a bit of a loose interpretation of the dish. It was however more filling than other plates we have had here in the past.   The service is a bit slow and the atmosphere a touch on the pretentious side, but I am grateful that there are places like this around that cater to those that like to eat on the healthier side.  Other note is that the unsweet tea was a bit odd, but after I drank a couple glasses, I am rather taken with it now. It seemed to have a hint of vanilla which surprised me at first."}
{"text":"This was our second time here. The first time we never had the opportunity to eat because the parking lot was packed. That was a Saturday afternoon. This time it was around 1:30 on a Friday. I'm so glad we decided to come back.   We were seated quickly but it took almost 10 mini for our waiter to come over...which is why I gave my review 4 stars instead of 5. However, after the initial wait, everything else was timely. We asked our waiter for recommendations. We ordere the chocolate chaga, which is a cold beverage that was very good, the gingerale, I LOVE ginger beer so I had to try this...it was so yummy! We also had the Living Burrito and the Fire & Brimstone burger, both with chili. We were so full when we left but very satisfied with our food. If I could have someone prepare meals for me like that daily, I'd be so much healthier. But until I'm able, I'll indulge at Living Kitchen."}
{"text":"Very vegan and clean. I had the brimstone burger and my friend had a salad that I can't remember the name of. Eat here once and you've had a week cleanse. Service was also great. Their juices are amazing as well. It IS a little pricey so check out the prices beforehand."}
{"text":"My all-time favorite place in Charlotte to go due to the fact that they have holistic and healthy food and flavors that they mixed together are amazing. Had their hot chocolate and it was out of this world. The vegan lasagna is bursting with amazing herbs and spices. And the salads are some of the best I've ever had. I cannot go to Charlotte without going here to eat."}
{"text":"Luna's version of a BLT...YUMMERS. Advacdo, Tomatoes, Mushroom Meat, Cashew Aioli on multi grain bread. I think I found my new favorite sandwich."}
{"text":"Luna's was delicious! Great portion sizes (split a side Broccoli Waldorf salad as appetizer) and entrees were big and delicious - not to mention very well informed and helpful staff!"}
{"text":"Luna's is amazing. You will be surprised by how full you feel after a raw vegan meal and the amount of flavor. I've eaten there several times and loved everything I got. I especially like the burrito."}
{"text":"If based on food alone I would easily give Luna's 5 stars...but sadly the poor service is the biggest distraction from eating here. I would love to tell you that it only happened once but no, many occasions. Today being the most annoying because there are floaters in my glass of water and I would love to tell the waitstaff about it but they ALL are MIA."}
{"text":"I thought the restaurant was very clean. Well I didn't think it I could see it. The waitress was friendly and being that it was our first time there she took her time to explain and recommend what she would and wouldn't get. I had the Rawco Taco Salad and let me tell you it was the Bomb.com. I also ordered a ginger ale (warning do not get it if you are expecting ginger ale like at the grocery store) it was different I was not a big fan of it all. The atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing modern / boho sheak. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place ten stars - the food is out of this world and the lattes are even better. It seems a little pricey at first, but the quality of the food and the portion sizes make it completely worth it. I'm pretty upset that I'm leaving Charlotte today or I would absolutely be coming back for dinner."}
{"text":"I love Luna's. I am a raw food chef myself so this is the only place in all of North Carolina where i have found my people! My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the cacao pudding. I also give a big thumbs up to the manicotti. its perfect. so much to choose from but i fall in the habit of repeatedly ordering the same few items because they are so good. I also enjoyed the rich tomato tartlet. The atmosphere is high ceiling open air ambiance. This is the type of place to go when you can share with others adn try lots of dishes. The portions are ample and they mostly use organic. I feel at home here and could make anything on the menu on command but its nice to be served and have someone else uncooking for me! :) By the time i have one of the fresh squeezed juices, a main dish and the cacao dessert(which i will get everytime)...the bill is already pretty high for one....but its worth it for the quality. plenty of parking....next to the train in charlotte Atherton Mill farmers market."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the cuisine here. Everything is always so fresh and delicious. Although on the expensive side, for the quality of food, it's totally worth it.   I've seen all the other excellent reviews, so I may be the lone wolf who has been less than impressed with the service, particularly with those who work at the juice bar. I've had an issue with service almost every time I've visited. I'm usually ignored, spoken to in a condescending manner or quite abruptly.   As stated before, food is great, but because of the level of service that I have personally experienced, I limit my visits to once a quarter (always hoping that my next visit will result in incredible service with a smile)."}
{"text":"For someone who is not vegan or vegetarian I find this place to be a great place every few months when I am craving something very clean. I always leave full but never completely satisfied. Their juices are delicious though, and their cranberry but bread is to die for!  Follow me at: jodieats_  Photo credit: Tarra Dahlke"}
{"text":"This is my second time doing a Vegan Challenge, and I always find it hard to eat out, so I avoid eating out. But when I am traveling, I do not have many options. I am so glad I found this place on a trip to Charlotte! I loved everything about it, the ambience, the food, and even the smell.  It is a very open concept restaurant with a rustic chic design. They have a fridge and a bar right at the entrance, where you can pick up quick eats and juices. They also have numerous tables for you to enjoy a meal.  The food was amazing! So flavorful, delicious and vegan! I had the Fire Burger, and it was OMG! Just the right amount of spice. The guacamole was really good, and the mix of the quinoa pattie with the sunflowerseed hummus was perfect. My side was the Oyster Mushroom Kale Salad, which was very fresh! I loved the ginger dressing.  For dessert I had the Berries Cheesecake. I never thought vegan could taste so good! Hands down to the cheesecake!!!  I also got a green juice for tomorrow. I am sure it will be just as good.  I am definately coming back whenever in charlotte (maybe even tomorrow...lol)"}
{"text":"After MONTHS of wanting to come here, I finally made it. This place is super cute, the ideal decor if I were to have a trendy restaurant. I loved the huge art pieces on the wall and the spiral staircase. The service was kindaaaa really slow. She told us 15-20 minutes, but it was longer than that and there were open tables (not sure what was going on could be a system). I decided to get the Lunasagna and Pinko Drinko and it was amazingly good and filled me up. I got a side of caesar salad and it was hands down the best caesar salad I have ever had. The play on lasagna was delicious, I highly recommend getting it! Everything was so fresh, I loved it. As a meat lover, I would recommend coming here to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great food and service,  Living burrito was tastefully and delicious & pad Thai it's a most. The ogre smoothie was perfectly balanced between sweet and sour just as a meal or dessert."}
{"text":"Simply put.....WOW!  So glad that I decided to try Luna's Living Kitchen.  The living burrito was delicious with just the right amount of spice, the hot sauce on the side added another layer of spice with a hint of smokiness.  Can't wait to go back and try their other menu items."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant & I was definitely not impressed. Everyone was nice but what should've been a quick bite turned into us being there for almost 2 hours. The place wasn't very big and it took forever for me to even get my drink. Waited maybe 30 minutes for food & our server didn't even let us know what she was doing. She just kind of came and left a few times."}
{"text":"currently sitting in my car eating hummus, chips and strawberries out of my lunchbox after getting ignored by two different members of the staff at Luna's Living Kitchen here in Charlotte. which is pretty embarrassing when you're out to grab a quick bite by yourself after getting tattooed for five hours and feeling famished. ten minute wait just to get greeted, all for a smoothie and a salad? nope, not even worth it! two thumbs way down, guys. good thing my #rootshummus never leaves me hangin'!"}
{"text":"I first tried Luna's about 6 weeks ago...and have eaten there approximately 20x since! I have loved almost everything on the menu.  Location: great Southend location, just across the parking lot from Icehouse. You can stroll over to the Atherton Market after eating as it's just steps away. There is a nice patio with umbrella shade for days that aren't too hot. The inside has decent seating, but bring a sweater. It's always super cold!   Service: super friendly servers that are knowledgeable about the menu. If you come during peak hours, expect to wait just a little.   Menu: everything is plant-based, vegan, and raw. I often wish for them to add something (anything!!) warm to the menu!! Some days, I just don't want cold food! That being said...it's so delicious. My menu reviews: * Fire & Brimstone: get it in a collard leaf and ask for extra sambal sauce. Their Quinoa-millet burgers are savory and have a good texture.  * Living Burrito: one of my go-to menu items. Very filling. Great \"sour cream\" and spicy sambal sauce. Can be messy to eat and doesn't do well as a leftover...so eat it all!  * Rawco Taco Salad: Order this. Just trust me. I wish they gave you more than the 3 crackers on the side! Lots of avocado, walnut \"taco meat\", cashew sour cream, and crunchy lettuce.  * Vietnamese Pho: This wasn't bad, but I like real Pho too much to order this dish again. Kelp noodles and other ingredients are brought to your table then broth (yay for a slightly warm dish!!) is poured over the top at your table. The key to delicious pho is the broth and this just isn't Luna's wheelhouse.  * Sweet potato sushi: only menu item I just simply did not like.  * Falafel: a great appetizer! Yummy hummus served with pesto covered pitted olives, faux falafel balls, and pickled vegetables that were surprisingly amazing.  * Lemon raspberry cheesecake: No cheese, no cake, yet somehow this is a delicious cheesecake. It's a mystery. Or a miracle. But it's delicious.  * Favorite smoothie: Popeye Punch - green smoothie with great hemp protein (not too gritty) and a sweet-but-not-too-sweet taste * Favorite juice: Volcano- grab one out of the fridge and take it to go!  My friends have ordered the pad thai and lunasagna and have declared them yummy. I have not ordered either yet, but I trust their taste buds!   In summary, ignore the little voice in your head that tells you that spending money on raw food is insane and go give Luna a try. Chances are, you'll see me there!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my fave place to eat when I come to Charlotte. I am vegan and it is pretty hard to find healthy and tasty vegan food. I am never ever disappointed. No photos all the food when down the hatch! Mmmm"}
{"text":"A nice healthy and fresh option in downtown Charlotte.  All of the food is raw (except the chocolate chip cookies) and much of it is vegan as well. Good flavor a and nice options to explore even for the non-vegan crowd. Fresh setting with tables for two or a group. Lunasagna and the salads were very tasty. Really well executed concept."}
{"text":"My first time at Living Kitchen and can't wait to go back. The decor is lovely. I went for breakfast and got the vanilla chia pudding and coffee. Cannot say anything but wonderful things. I am already planning on going for lunch."}
{"text":"A bit pretentious and I think it is overpriced for what you get. But still healthy raw food and fairly tasty in a trendy location. Waitress was very accommodating and eager to please."}
{"text":"This all Vegan, Vegetarian & healthy   restaurant is AMAZING.. the basil & avocado sandwich with sprouts and gluten free sour dough bread is LIFE CHANGING..... meals are expensive but you are getting what you pay for... delicious clean, REAL food ... so yummy and you feel so good KNOWING what you are eating..."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I've had to dedicate an hour and a half to dining here for lunch a few times.  It's not quick but it's excellent."}
{"text":"I've eaten at both here and their previous location across the drive--much better venue now.  The place is hip with ample room, the staff is friendly and well informed, and the food--albeit a little pricey--is stellar.  Fabulous, actually.     They stay true to their vegan roots with handcrafted offerings assembled with uber-fresh food.  Some may think serving vegan food is simply frying up a pile of tofu and saying, \"enjoy\"!  Not here.  Lots of outta the box thinking which proves (to me at least) that quality, wholesomeness, and value are intertwined.  And there is room for the menu to grow, too.  Yes, one can order a Big Mac value meal for half the price, but it may also get you to the morgue in half the time, too.  I heartily recommend Luna's as a solid restaurant in Charlotte's culinary scene."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan and vegetarian food.  It was so popular that the dish I wanted was off the menu because it sold out.  This is usually a good sign that a restaurant is using fresh ingredients and also that they are serving great food.  I would go back again anytime.  The BBQ sliders were what was sold out and I tried them the second time I went.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow. This food is great. I'm not a vegan but I do like healthy, fresh food so I go crazy for these kinds of places. For my first visit I ordered the Living Burrito with a side of Cauliflower Rice and was very impressed. Got my food in about 10min and it tasted incredible. It's a little hidden (I drove past it twice) because it's behind some office buildings but it's definitely worth the search. I will be returning to the Living Kitchen soon!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here solo on a busy weekday during lunch. There was a pretty good crowd--mostly business people and expensive-looking women lunching with friends.   I wasn't too crazy about the house made ginger ale, but I loved my rawco taco salad. It was so fresh and delicious. I also got a cacao cacao smoothie and it exceeded my expectations. If I lived in Charlotte, I could see myself stopping in for a to-go smoothie on the regular.   The service was a little bit slow and the waitress was kind of absent...but I chalked it up to either being really busy or the fact that I was eating alone. I don't know!   Overall, the salad and smoothie outweighed anything semi off putting. I also really loved the big windows that let in tons of natural light! The interior is really clean and modern-looking with small vases of fresh flowers on every table. Loved that little touch!  Thanks, guys for some delicious food! :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful place overall. As soon and my friend and I got there we were seated, but then we had to wait for at least 15 minutes for anyone to approach us letting us know we would be helped. We waited to get out water then did not see our server for another 10 minutes she apologized for our wait and took our order. It took an hour for our food to come out. We were very pleased with the appearance but it just took way too long! But like I said at the beginning it was a great place the service just was not very good. My god turned our great though and I loved the taste. I am new to the whole vegan thing so it was great to try a few new things"}
{"text":"I'm new to the raw lifestyle. I was a southern girl when it came to breakfast. So I woke up hungry this morning. I wanted something filling; but healthy. I called in the Flying Lucy smoothie and the biblical breakfast. OMG! I was not prepared for this. I feel so much life from his food. It's GOOD. I taste everything in he meal. The bananas are sweet and flavorful. The sliced citrus is juicy. He spread in the vegan bread mixed with the nuts give a tasty hearty bite! Plus drizzled with sweet honey/syrupy goodness! And the ingredients in the smoothie is so refreshing. This feels so much better than processed oatmeal or cream of wheat and scrambled eggs. I'm LVING his new lifestyle. One day at a time!"}
{"text":"Like many of you,  I'm not a vegetarian. But the food here is not just taste good, it tastes different! Love the Smoothies here, must try!!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find, it's in the office building but on the side opposite to Wells Fargo.  Love the outside setting of this place, so beautiful!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Charlotte. Clean delicious food that I would eat everyday if only it was closer to my uptown work/hotel locations.  Luna, think about it!!"}
{"text":"Words can not describe how much the Mrs and I enjoyed this restaurant. Traveling to Atlanta, we Yelped Vegan while on interstate 85. Living Kitchen came up and it was on the route we were traveling. We changed our route and I was glad we did. Now we were looking at the pictures of the different meals and by the time we arrived, we didn't know what to order.  Thank God for Cassandra, she was our server as she knows her stuff! She told us what was good, better and best for newbie Vegan eaters. The Mrs order the Kitchen Sink, no really she ordered the WHOLE kitchen sink and a \"pizza\"! Very impressive meal, the pizza with NO animal by products was exquisite! My wife ate her WHOLE meal and we were supposed to share the salad! I ordered the avocado and basil sandwich and a cup of lentil soup. OMG, you could have told me salmonella was on my sandwiches and I still would have eaten it! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to return. Excellent raw vegan food. The fire and brimstone burger wrapped in a collard leaf was the bomb.  MUST get a cacao smoothie.... Worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"I loooove Luna's...I have to eat here every time I come to Charlotte...I especially LOVE their Waldorf broccoli salad...the entrée is big enough to fill me up by itself, but their smoothies are also fabulous. It's spectacular and a must-visit"}
{"text":"What a refreshing change from standard fare.  Great staff, atmosphere and food! Living Burrito is a one of a kind dish and simply brilliant in taste and presentation.  I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Very clean and fresh dining in experience. Only downside is that I like warm food and their entrees are all cold. The salads are great. I love the beet side dish and the smoothies. The yogurt and granola breakfast item is great and you can just go in and grab it from the fridge and head to work."}
{"text":"I found this place during my week fast. I was in search of the best coconut water in town and this place was it. Each bottle was $5 each. I didn't realize the type of food that was served here, but it did look appetizing! High priced, but excellent quality ingredients/food products offered."}
{"text":"Went two days in a row with my hunny!  Everything was amazing!  I definitely recommend everything on the menu even though we didn't try everything.  We ordered 5 different items each time. My top three favs..  Classic Veggie burger Biblical breakfast( Sunday only)  Manicotti!   Take a friend and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I am not vegan or vegetarian, but strive to have a healthy balanced diet especially since I eat out s much. This place is spotless and so far has better service than the south end location. I recommend the pho soup and the ceased salad. The pad Thai and harvest arugula salad is also another go to for me. If I feel like I need some carbs I get the mock tuna salad.  I always feel comfortably full after leaving and feel good that I treated my body right!"}
{"text":"The food is very tasty and well presented. I enjoyed the avocado and basil sandwich on the whole grain bread. The only reason I am giving this establishment  a three is because it only offers food that contains nuts in almost every item. I love nuts but my husband can not eat them as well as lot of other folks. The hummus is yummy but it is nutty, the whole grain bread is very nutty and grainy as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always amazing the service is amazing. I could go on about how much I love this place.  I will say I am vegan so the food is amazing to me but it's definitely not where you want to take your non vegan friends who have never had a vegan meal at all. I mean it's not bad it's just different. There's a big difference between vegan and raw vegan so if they're not used to it, it could be an interesting experience. Although the wait staff does a very good job of explaining the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick green juice and vegan yogurt and granola. Most amazing coconut cashew yogurt and cacao granola. The restaurant was open, airy and extremely inviting."}
{"text":"Great smoothies, power pack shot was great! We are visiting from Raleigh and think we need a Luna's Living Kitchen downtown."}
{"text":"If someone would prepare vegetarian meals like this for me every day, I would never eat meat again! I ordered the falafel appetizer, classic burger and we all split a bottle of wine. Everything was delicious, the burger was a \"real\" burger portion size and I chose the beet salad side. My friends ordered the living bagel (amazing) and faux tuna sandwich (wonderful.) Such delicious little place!"}
{"text":"This vegan restaurant was awesome.  The server was helpful and very friendly, the place is bright and sunny, and the food was terrific.  I am not vegetarian or vegan and sometimes shy away from such places.  For those of you like me, I would urge you to go against those instincts and give this restaurant a try.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Friendly service and staff. I love the fact the fact that it is all vegetarian menu. We were a group of six friends, so tried a bunch of different things on their menu. Food was not bad nor amazing.  They do have a great variety of smoothies and they were delicious too. I would recommend this place and would likely go back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"If you think you could not possibly enjoy raw, vegan food, this place will prove you wrong! Have been here several times and have loved everything I've gotten. Lunasagna and the living burrito were both delicious...but this time I ordered a fire and brimstone veggie burger. My word. Love the spiciness, the hummus and Guac as condiments, and the burger itself had such a rich flavor. Had it with the local greens salad which was just delicious as well. For dessert, I had a layered pie with white and dark chocolate mousse on a pecan crust with raspberry coulis. I'm describing it because I can't remember the name, but I will not soon forget the taste! Beautiful flavor without too much sweetness. I have a vegan in the family, so I originally tried this place for her, but the amazing food keeps me coming back! Absolutely delicious and never do I feel guilty after eating here. Everything is delicious, fresh, and healthy. What could be better??"}
{"text":"One of the few places you can eat til you're plenty full without feeling lethargic and weighed down afterwards. For breakfast go with the coconut parfait if you're feeling something sweet or the living bagel if you're wanting savory."}
{"text":"I love living kitchen, it's always a treat to come here with the hubs. You never leave filling disgustingly full, and you obviously get served some amazing vegan food!!! Loaded with nutrients and zero regrets. I ordered the Quesadilla and it's my new favorite thing!! The chipotle \"cheese\" on this was the bomb! I already want another. For desserts we got carrot cake and the chocolate. The chocolate was better in my opinion but the carrot cake was still yummy. Everything was delicious as always."}
{"text":"The perfect place For any vegan ,vegetarian and gluten-free patron who would love to enjoy a fabulous meal prepared by wonderful people. My wife and I went Valentines evening and had a wonderful five-star dinner that was good for us and that sustained our body.  Kudos to the waitstaff the cooks the chef and the front of house staff as it was a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"Although I typically avoid trendy new restaurants in their first year (particularly those in Southpark), my curiosity got the best of me in the case of this hot new vegan sensation. I'm glad it did as there is nothing typical about it. It seems ironic though that such an organic concept resides in the bottom corner of an office building, yet you forget its staid exterior immediately upon strolling thru the main entrance.   The interior is bright, pristine and impeccably decorated with modern furnishings. The menu is simple and intriguing. I went with the Avocado & Basil sandwich which was very satisfying even for a meat eater like me. My wife was more adventerous and chose the Tomatico Tart which has an almond meal crust. She enjoyed it but we both had expected a crunchy crust instead of the actual moist crust that it came with. At the suggestion of the server, we we both chose their most popular side, the Broccoli Waldorf Salad. It was refreshing and delicious.  There's so much more to try including the house-made hemp, coconut and almond milks; however, like most vegan restaurants this odyssey will be an expensive, one yet one we will enjoy. As one might expect, this place is a Gotta Try."}
{"text":"Luna's is my surprise new favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I travel to Charlotte a lot for work, and finding healthy places to eat is difficult in a new city. But Luna's fits the bill perfectly.   I'm by no means a vegan, nor even a vegetation, but I do love vegetables and often find that restaurants focus too much on the \"comfort\" of meats and fried foods rather than veggies. That's where Luna's is different.   From the moment you enter, Luna's feels like you're entering a hip yoga studio rather than a restaurant.   I've only ever had take out, but the two \"entrees\" I tried were excellent. The rawco taco salad was big, spicy, and garlicky goodness, served with a side of delicious seams crispy things. Honestly I don't know what they were but I loved them.   I also tried the pad Thai. I've never had zucchini noodles before, but these were super. At first I thought they had used real noodles instead! The dish is a delectable combination of 'noodles', bell peppers, bean sprouts, and lots of other veggies, mixed together with an amazingly tasty spicy peanut sauce. I'm actually not a huge fan of pad Thai in general, but this vegan version is amazing!"}
{"text":"Yes, the food is raw. Yes, the food will be cold. But the unique blend of fresh ingredients and vegetables will be a unique experience for your taste buds!! This place offers all kinds of juices and food options. It's truly a fresh breath of air from all the processed and fried foods other eateries offer.   Now let's get started with the review... I had the Living Burrito and my family members had the Manicotti and Lunasagna. I did have more than one spoonful (or forkful I should say) of their plates as well so I feel qualified to review all the dishes. The Living burrito filling was delicious, from the refried beans to the cauliflower rice mixture. The collard leaf that wrapped together the ingredients was really hard to break through though. I also felt the dish went overboard with sprouts. I'm not a big fan of sprouts so it might just be me. The Manicotti was by far my favorite dish, excellent ricotta cashew cheese filling!! It made me never want regular ricotta cheese again, seriously where can I but cashew cheese?? The filling was wrapped by a thin slice of zucchini acting as the pasta. All served with a marinara sauce on top.  Lunasagna was my second favorite dish, more zucchini noodles and tomato sauce giving a spin on traditional lasagna. I did feel the portion was kinda tiny.  Side salads- I had the local green salad that came with more sprouts, cherry tomatoes and homemade hemp dressing on top of greens.  If I had to choose again I would get the Broccoli Waldorf- tiny broccoli bits, green apple, walnuts and raisins tossed with vegan mayo and lemon juice. I had a few bites from someone else's plate and it was tangy and sweet but oh so delicious!"}
{"text":"Best.Food.Ever.  Visiting from Seattle and this place blew my mind. Asher was awesome and so helpful with recommendations! We'll only be here 3 days but I'm trying to figure out how much of the menu I can plow thru in that time! ;) We had the arugula harvest salad and avocado basil sandwich. Both were amazeballs. I'm vegan, husband is not and we both left verrrrry happy.  ETA: got the turtle cake to go. I can now die happy. That is all."}
{"text":"Lunch exceeded my expectations. This vegan restaurant specializes in organic, plant-based cuisine. I started with the sweet potato sushi rolls with Thai chili sauce. They were so cute I almost didn't want to eat them. I didn't want a salad so I tried the broccoli Waldorf. It had walnuts, raisins, celery, green apple, & red onion mixed with cashew mayo. It was similar to my dad's broccoli salad minus the bacon & he uses broccoli florets. The BBQ sliders with oyster mushrooms topped with cole slaw were so good. I've been wanting to try oyster mushrooms for awhile & they are a great meat substitute. They are a little different from regular mushrooms. For dessert, I had the turtle cake. Maaaaaannnnn, it's one of best vegan desserts I've had. I believe the crust was Medjool dates & pecans. The filing was coconut meat, more dates, cacao, & soaked cashews blended together to make yummy goodness. The caramel sauce was just blended dates if I remember correctly. I'm so full and happy."}
{"text":"I love LOVE this place! Love the fresh food, the atmosphere and I've never EVER had bad service. My all time favorite dish is the Rawco Taco Salad. Or the Living Burrito. OR the Fire and Brimstone Burger. Or or or omg everything is awesome!"}
{"text":"My friend and I sat at the bar, and the bar tender was super friendly and engaging. We chatted about her favorites on the menu, and some items she liked in the fridge (cookie bites?). My friend ordered the ogre shake and LOVED it. I ordered the fire and brimstone burger with the Caesar salad and it was really good. It's no burger and fries, but give it a try!   I loved the space too.   Highly recommend as a unique place that's healthy and local ingredients.   Even for the \"picky\" eager, between the juices, shakes and other beverages there is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Vegan when at home but regular eater when I'm on vacation-ordered a large salad with a veggie patty, a \"cheesecake\" dessert and some juices to be waiting for me at my hotel before their 9 pm closing time-ended up being thoroughly impressed with the freshness of everything, the attention I detail, and the abundance of crunchy spiralized veggies on my salad. Will order again most definitely-and I appreciate their use of glass bottles as well."}
{"text":"As a pescatarian I'm surprised it took me so long to check this place out...I absolutely loved it!! I thought it was vegetarian but to my surprise it was actually an all vegan place, which I was still totally okay with! Our waitress kassandra was probably one of the nicest servers I have ever had she was very knowledgeable and for my after dinner coffee allowed me to sample the hemp and coconut milks (which are both made in house) before making a decision. I had the kale pearadise juice (kale, pear, pineapple, cucumber, and fennel) which was very tasty and fresh! My friend and I split the sweet potato sushi which was also very good! As an entree I had the manicotti and Cesar salad, which I was very pleased with. I will definitely be back again I was very pleased with everything about this place :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a vegan restaurant and it won't be my last. I was visiting a friend and she suggested this place for breakfast. Normally I'm all for bacon, home fries, pancakes and such, but I like to change it up a bit. Boy was this a big and very delicious change.  We ordered and shared the Biblical Breakfast which was their French toast and fruit. All of the different spreads and butters were amazing and so flavorful. The fresh fruit garnish of berries and bananas was also very delicious.   I also ordered a green smoothie and some juices to go. All were wonderfully fresh and the flavors all together we're just perfect. I'll definitely make a stop back in the next time I'm there."}
{"text":"This was one of the best vegan restaurants I've ever been too! Service was amazing and the food even more!!! They make their own milk and have lots if organic products. I will be DEFINITELY going back. Highly highly recommend this if you're looking for a good vegan meal"}
{"text":"This was the most incredible place and food! I've heard so much about Luna's and it's even BETTER than everyone says! I absolutely love the place, decor is incredible and tendu, hipster, gorgeous. But raw vegan whole foods... If you wonder the answer is yes!! Yes you want it!! We had the basil Avocado sandwich which was so beautifully seasoned, fantastic bread, perfect per portions. Also had the kale lemonade. You could taste each ingredient... So interesting and awesome! Broccoli salad was nothing like what you're used to, 100 times better!! Oh I can't wait to come back and try each thing!"}
{"text":"Visited here on my first trip to Charlotte after a friend moved to the city. It was so, so delicious ! The kale lemonade was amazing! Also had the raw lasagna. Would go back again and again and certainly recommend to anyone who would listen!"}
{"text":"I literally cannot say enough good things about this place and how excited I am to have happened upon it.   Lavender cappuccino ohhhh my god. Perfect mix of sweet and coffee and floral deliciousness. This alone gets the 5 stars.  Got the living burrito with a side of kale Caesar. So. The living burrito. Literally will make you forget you're eating straight veggies disguised as a burrito. Such good flavors and the lettuce wrap just makes it a million times better. The salsa on the side is a great spice to add.   Kale Caesar has great flavor, perfect side for when you just wanna add some greens in there.   So many things to come back and try because I am so into this menu!"}
{"text":"If you're into this kind of food this place is a 10 plus, but it's not for everyone.  I'm not a vegan, but I have multiple allergies that make places like this an oasis for me.  I thought that the prices were reasonable for the quality.  The food is fresh and tasty, creative and healthy.  I loved the house made chai (with coconut milk, but you have a choice of almond, etc).  I got snacks to go for the car ride home to Raleigh.  Locals, you are lucky to have a place like this!"}
{"text":"Let me say first that I will definitely be going back to Luna's... So many things on the menu look great! I started off with a caramel latte made with coconut milk. The caramel sauce is made with dates so it really wasn't as flavorful as what I am accustomed to a caramel sauce tasting like, however the coconut milk made it so delicious. After tip it was a $10 coffee so I am glad I enjoyed it. We ordered the cranberry walnut bread to start. It was a nice sized portion but we should have ordered the almond butter instead of coconut butter for the spread. For dinner, we had the Caesar salad and the Rawco taco salad. The Caesar needs more. The dressing was flavorful and I liked it but I would have enjoyed some tomatoes and red onion or something other than just lettuce and dressing on an $11 dish. The taco salad was very good and had lots of interesting elements. Wonderful dressing.  For dessert we had a dense chocolate cake with a nutty crust. Very nice flavor and perfect if you just need to satisfy a sweet tooth. The service is good and the space is beautiful and relaxing. A bit on the pricey side, but understandable for the concept they are so expertly executing."}
{"text":"My husband and I find it extremely hard to find really tasty, filling, healthy food when eating out. This fits the bill! Delicious, fresh and flavorful. A great variety on the menu. We started with the gluten free sourdough bread appetizer. My husband had the Fire and Brimstone burger (very good - coming from a burger lover). I had the Manicotti with salad side, both very fresh. Washed that down with Ginger Ale. Topped the evening off with Turtle Cake and Lemon Berry Cheesecake. Both desserts were scrumptious. Excellent food, friendly service and welcoming atmosphere. Why can't there be more restaurants like this out there??"}
{"text":"The food was delicious just like their SouthEnd location...but I found it really loud inside. Seemed like I had to yell to the person sitting across from me!  Maybe they need some They have a great \"bar\" right when you walk in and make it easy to pick up to-go orders. Hint: you can order online on their website!!   The veggie burger and kale caesar salad are DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I never heard of this place until my buddy mentioned it. She raved about it and set up a lunch date for us right away. I loved it from the moment we walked in. Super cute look. Nice vibe. And tons of healthy food options - perfect for a fitness freak like myself!   Since I don't do bread (except for the occasional cheat meal), I ordered the falafel sandwich but minus the bread. They converted it into a beautiful lettuce wrap. Fresh and delicious.   They were many options to choose from and I can't wait to go back and explore!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but where is the substance to any of the food? Where are the potatoes? Where's the rice? Where are are the carbs? I would have to order 4 or 5 things just to feel full. Not worth the amount you're paying for the very little you get to eat. Again, disappointed with the vegan options in Charolette"}
{"text":"The service was terrible, the speed of service was no better but the actual food was great...its a shame how the service was considering the taste of the food...and the dessert! Oh my! So good.  My appetizer: sweet potato sushi Meal: pad Thai Dessert: lemon berry cheesecake"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing! We both had burgers and they were delicious. The Waldorf salad is a must have! Service is slightly slow but they know the menu!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in and ate very expensive avocados and smoothies. Our waitress was lovely, the restaurant is beautiful but the food was just nothing special and overpriced. We had the brimstone burger and it was just okay. The smoothies were $8.50 each and pretty basic. I love the idea and really hope to see this concept grow in the city but it needs to either be tastier or more affordable."}
{"text":"Had the soup and spicy veggie burger. Both were really good and reasonably priced. Nice interior."}
{"text":"Today was my second time dining at this establishment. I had a decent experience the first time; however, my second time visiting was less than desirable. I decided to bring an out of town guest. Unfortunately, from the moment we walked in, we felt as if the staff did not want to be there. The hostess appeared to be very unhappy with her job. She was not welcoming at all. Not once did she smile or welcome us to the restaurant. It was 11:30am, and the restaurant was not busy. So it is difficult to understand why she interacted with us the way that she did. What is more, the server seemed to have the same attitude, snooty and dismissive. Considering we ordered $60 worth of food, I thought the server would have refilled our water. Not once did she ask how everything tasted. Nor, did she ask if we needed anything else. Although the food was good, I'm highly disappointed with my experience. I'm not quite sure if I will return. Tip for management: vegan does not have to equate to snooty. Typically, the staff is a reflection of those in the position of leadership. Perhaps, taking a more humble approach might help. ***SOUTH BLVD LOCATION"}
{"text":"Best Pho ever!! I ordered the manicotti and my wife ordered the pad thai. Both were really good and like most times we eat vegan hard to imagine, really beautiful and artistic to look at, packed full of flavor, and delicious! Wish we had this place in Columbia. And yeah, the Pho was wow! Definitely suggest that to anyone"}
{"text":"My (omnivore) boyfriend and (vegetarian) I finally went here on a date, and we were both really pleased with everything we ordered (not to mention the TOTALLY GORGEOUS restaurant interior!!!). The raw pad thai wasn't as expected (raw noodle-style roots in place of noodle noodles) but it was still really fresh, zesty, and tasty. The Pho was absolutely delectable--cozy, nice accompaniments, and a surprisingly-sturdy-for-being-vegetable-based broth.   I also ordered the house chai latte with almond milk. The flavor was fun and the foam was high, but it was thinner than the syrupy lattes you might get from your local café so be prepared for the different-but-lovely experience.  I left full to the brim, but my boyfriend (who usually leaves the table just not-hungry anyway) did want a cheeseburger later in the evening, which didn't begrudge a bit since he came along with me to Luna's. :) I can't wait to try some of their other uncommon dishes."}
{"text":"Food: LOVED (I got the raw lasagna- it was to die for!)  Service: Terrific! The gal was super amazing and even helped me navigate the menu and avoid my sesame allergy! Not easy to do in a vegan restaurant.  Atmosphere: Nice. I didn't think the rock music was too loud (previous review) except for about 15 seconds, oddly enough. I guess they were reallllllly into the Pink Floyd song they were playing and wanted us all to enjoy it, too lol  Prices: A bit high considering the amount of food you get... Still worth it, though.   I will surely be back next time I'm in town :)"}
{"text":"Lovely, magical vegan gem in the city. I stayed in Charlotte for work and venture here for breakfast and I loved it so much I came back for dinner on my way out of the city. Can't recommend it enough. I'm from Los Angeles and am very partial to my home state's vast array of options but the flavors at Living Kitchen are unforgettable and I'll miss them! I ordered as much food as I could wolf down. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!! I'm vegetarian, but it was the first time that I've been in Vegan restaurant and I'm so glad I went!  My husband is not vegetarian but he has some food allergies and usually is very hard to go to somewhere we can trust, so his nutritionist told him about this place that is just 5 minutes from our home. I ordered the Living Burrito with Broccoli Waldorf on the side and the Lemon-Berry Cheesecake for desert, everything was delicious specially the desert! My husband loved it too! I wish I could eat there everyday or learn how to cook like that!   The place looks clean, the decoration is nice and our server did a really good job (she knew everything about the restaurant and the food)."}
{"text":"The ambiance, waiters, and freshness/ quality here could not be better. I am so jealous of the owners for having such a beautiful business! This place is an oasis of real food in Charlotte. I NEVER sit down to eat lunch in a restaurant, but here, I do it all the time! Warning, there are some weird food combinations here!!! The sandwiches and salads are pretty much all great, as well as the BBQ sliders. Just read the menu carefully!"}
{"text":"Know before you go.  Luna's is for you if you value the confluence of nutrition,  sensory appeal, and food-safety.  You will not find traditional comfort food here, and don't come with ideas of scoring a bargain.  It is not budget conscious,  but there is definitely value for the money spent.  Think twice...this is a VEGAN establishment. ..... no fish, chicken, pork, or beef.   I am a frequent habitue at Luna's because there are so few other restaurants that meet my criteria for a meal.  I am not vegan, because I eat fish, but otherwise I am.  I don't want heavily salted food, any  simple carbohydrates/sugars, nor any processed foods.  Luna's dots every i, crosses every t.  I can order anything on the menu without worry.  Exception :  I don't drink adult beverages, and they sell wine and beer.  Have not ever been disappointed with an eat-in or take out meal here.  Frequently I will order a take out meal for dinner when I dine in for lunch.....and I love how I can look forward to dinner with this plan.  I also value the fact that they are environmentally conscious viz. carry-out containers."}
{"text":"Visited Charlotte with a group of friends and decided to try this place. We tried the sweet potato sushi roll, living burrito, rawco taco salad, lunasagna and avocado & basil sandwich with broccoli waldorf. My favorite dishes were the rawco taco salad and avocado & basil sandwich. The sandwich is on multigrain bread and it's delicious. It gives the sandwich a really nice bite. Overall, the food was all very flavorful, fresh, and had a lot of texture. My only critiques are the lunasagna was too salty for my liking and we received somewhat slow service considering we were there for a late lunch. There were maybe three other small tables besides us. Therefore, I give Luna's Living Kitchen 4 stars and would visit again when in town."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying I live in Columbia SC. I used to travel to go to Living Kitchen back when it was Luna's Living Kitchen. I LOVED Luna's! The atmosphere and the service was great! The food was absolutely amazing and really creative. I haven't had the opportunity to try the food since they switched over to Living Kitchen but I had a friend coming down from Charlotte that bought me some food.  I was completely dissatisfied. I order the Living Burrito with a Broccoli Waldorf salad and the Sweet Potato Sushi. The burrito did not come with the hot sauce, no pico de gallo, no sunflower refried beans or srpouts and old guacamole. I basically got two giant collard leaves with cauliflower rice. It had absolutely no flavor at all. The broccoli salad had no flavor at all. It didn't even taste like broccoli or cashew mayo! I only tasted the raisins! The sushi was okay but I've had better in the past. The nori just seemed to be chewy and maybe that was due to the ride and the sauce was a tad bit too spicy but I'm not complaining about that. Overall, I really loved Luna's Living Kitchen but I will never eat here again. I felt it was a complete waste of money. And they got rid of the Turtle Cake which really got to me! That was my FAVORITE! I would order at least three and some to go on my trips! I would say I'd be back for some smoothies and juices but honestly at this point I'm afraid to try anything and it be a complete waste of money and time."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place for a light healthy meal. The look and feel of this place is light and airy, clean and modern. The decor is calming and the staff are friendly. The food was excellent.   What a nice find!"}
{"text":"The Caesar salad is my JAM!  I've never had a bad meal here though!  Tuna Salad is great, falafel mid yum and all the juices are tasty and filling.  It's pricey but delicious raw living food.  Oh and don't forget dessert!  Take home the yummy macaroons or ginger snaps.  I have some in my refrigerator that the kids KNOW not to touch or there will be hell to pay!  Even if you are not vegan you will enjoy this place.  I can't wait to go back for the burrito or lasagna I keep reading raves about.... Every time I go I end up with the Caesar or tuna or one of the delicious burgers and my pockets can't afford to do all so I have to go in rounds but seriously the Caesar is so good it's hard to NOT get it.  I love the open airy space of Luna's too.  It's beautiful and bright.  When I'm balling out of control I can't wait to try one of the juice cleanses."}
{"text":"Yummy, yum, yum,yum. Luna's living kitchen is the bomb I love Luna's  I feel amazing after eating here. It's all nature and the staff are amazing and wonderful. Please try it out I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Thanks to the previous review, I was able to locate this place. Otherwise, would've had to call for help.   Service- very sweet, but slow as molasses.   Food- raw vegan. If you like raw, you'll be pleased. But be prepared to waaaaait. I had the falafel appetizer, lunasagna with the side salad. (Posted a picture) The hemp salad dressing was amazing! But the lunasagna was just ok. Not really a fan of raw to be honest, so probably not the best choice of restaurants. But I'm from out of town and didn't know until the cab dropped me off! Oops.   They made up for the just ok dinner with the pumpkin pie- it was the best I've ever had. Wow. Can't say enough about it.   Atmosphere- old rock music that is too loud for my tastes. Freezing in here too (it's 45 outside).   My bill with tip was $38. Bit pricey I think."}
{"text":"My favorite Vegan restaurant!  Very tasty food, great presentation and their staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"It is a pricey! But so good and guiltless in a way! They truly get creative with their dishes and I am always satisfied. Love their juice selection as well!"}
{"text":"The salads are amazing, the dressing is bomb.  My usual is the \"Sprout it out\" or \"Arugula Harvest\" - always gud gud gud.    My only bad experiences were the living burrito (don't believe the hype) and the falafel - it wasn't fluffy and tender but hard and heavy  If you like almond milk, try theirs!  Delish.  Also try the chocolate chip raw cookies they keep in packages in the fridge!  I want to be buried in them.  Thank you Luna's for being a culinary refuge of light in this life of sin."}
{"text":"Wish we had one of these on every corner in town.  Can't say enough about this place. Clean food. Plant based. Pure Life."}
{"text":"Excellent. The live \"burger\" was AWESOME, so so so good. I kept thinking about it the next day. And how great is it to order a hot tea and it's not in a little bag?? Loose tea peppermint was great. I sat at the bar, traveling on business alone so it was perfect. Nice ambiance. I wanted dessert, they looked amazing, but I decided not to be a piggy.  Their juices looked really pricy, and too many of them have celery in them (which I loathe), so I decided to get two of their cooler items for breakfast later. I had the berry \"yogurt\" with the chocolate granola on top this morning. I usually will nto touch real yogurt with a 10' pole, but this stuff was GREAT. I can't wait to try the vanilla chia seed pudding with betty puree tomorrow morning. This place was great. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh my my - my veggie loving soul has found heaven on a plate!  If I lived in this town you could bet you'd find me here at least once or twice a week!  Oh so good!  First off the place was bright, spacious, sparkling clean and so inviting.  They did a fantastic job designing this place.  It also has a dog friendly patio which is AWESOME!    I sat at the bar since I was alone and was greeted by a couple very welcoming, smiles across their faces ladies.  Each was very helpful with menu explanations and gave superb recommendations to this first timer here.  They also periodically gave me and the gentleman next to me small samples of the smoothies they just made.  This was very considerate of them instead of washing the tiny extra bit down the sink.  And the Piña colada smoothie was the bomb!  Now I'm not a diehard vegan or RAW foodie, but this place could make it happen.  I had the lunasagna and it was bursting with flavor in every single mouth watering bite!  Everything was fresh and delectable!  I really wanted to lick my plate, but thought that would be unacceptable - ha!  I also had the komucha beer and it was tangy, crisp and enjoyable.  Now - how can I get them to come to Houston ... this is really the big question!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place after learning about the benefits of a raw food diet and after having lunch here I must say that this will be my go to place. I love the building that Luna's is located in plenty of windows for sunshine and beautiful hard wood flooring . This place has an ultra sleek big city metropolitan feel to it. I started my lunch with the falafel sampler and it was delicious it also came with a yummy hummus and delicious pickled vegetables. As my drink I tried the chai latte which is made in house it puts Starbucks to shame. As my main entree I had the Rawco Taco salad and thought I was in heaven . To top it all off I had dessert it was a pumpkin like cheese cake and it was amazing . Even if your not vegan this is a place that is a must try for everyone. The staff is friendly and the food is good for you and the planet ! It's a win win for everybody ."}
{"text":"This place is really chill, lunch was amazing . It's in a ducked off spot which makes it even more chill. You get your own pitcher of water"}
{"text":"Went to late lunch with my family on my birthday. From the atmosphere to the food to the bathrooms everything was top notch can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"So I have tried a lot on the menu and have NOT loved w everything however the 5 stars is much deserved because of the following:  - every single juice they make is excellent (I've had them all) - it's a gorgeous and bright restaurant, ambiance gets a fiver  - the falafel are to die for  -the ALMOND MILK is so good - best salads ever, they have incredible salad dressing  - the cheesecake and most of the desserts are good. (I didn't care for the cookies)   What didn't I like ? The muesli and the brimstone burger. The burrito just tastes like a salad wrapped in leaves- id rather eat an actual salad honestly. It's definitely an excellent spot though!"}
{"text":"We had the best lunch here! I ordered the BLT with the broccoli Waldorf and my boyfriend ordered the avocado basil sandwich with cauliflower rice. We split both and they were both delicious!"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for one day and came here for Lunch. Loved it so much that I came for Dinner again!  This is the go-to place in Charlotte for Vegans/Vegetarians!   Awesome food, great staff, nice atmosphere, free parking!!"}
{"text":"This was the first place my hubby and I ate at after landing in Charlotte. Overall, it was good. There were some pros and cons and they are listed below:  CONS: - The cauliflower coconut soup could have been hotter. It was on the warm side and I like my soup hot. - The iced chai was a little watered down.   PROS: - The avocado basil sandwich was delicious! It actually inspired me to possibly order something similar to it in my hometown. I always thought, \"What's the point of ordering something so simple?\" Well, that mindset just changed after eating here. - The service is great. - The interior of the restaurant is trendy and cool.  So when it comes down to it, the ultimate question is this: Would I come back?   My Answer: Definitely."}
{"text":"Hands down best vegan place in charlotte and greater charlotte area. I can go on and on about this place but in short - this is not just a must go place but have to go place if you are into raw/vegan food. You will feel alive!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a bad rating because everything is made with nuts in it. Literally everything. I cannot even take my friends with nut allergies inside of this place or they start swelling up. I'm aware that there is like, one or two things on the menu without nuts, but the server couldn't guarantee that there wouldn't be contamination. I love vegan food, and there's definitely a way to make it so that it doesn't have to be so reliant on nuts! It's just really sad that I can't take my friends here, and isn't considerate of the many, many people who have nut allergies."}
{"text":"Excellent food and Excellent service. I highly recommended getting one of the appetizers and a smoothy - that's the perfect amount of food for a light, healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Listen. So I don't award 5 stars too often, but holy shit man. This place is like a flavor symphony. It's like eating art, not food. I've never experienced such a masterful artistry of fruits, vegetables and grains. People complaining that eating healthy tastes like shit obviously hasn't experienced this place. That's what it is. An experience. The ingredients are unusual, but delicious. Everything is a composition. Their menu is so unique and skillfully constructed. I could really give the chef a hug. No corners are cut here. There is real emotion in the food they make, real passion. It's obvious. Top five favorite in Charlotte, hands down."}
{"text":"I heard many great things about this place now, and I finally had the chance to go check it out! First impression of the place that it's very hipster & laid back- love!! But the service was SO S L O W. Literally waited for about 30 minutes for a table, & our waitress barely acknowledge us. The food completely makes up for it though, being a vegetarian myself I really appreciate this place! I ordered the basil & avocado sandwich with the grey hulk smoothie - omg it was SO good!! Super filling, and incredibly fresh! That's how you know it's real food (: Deff be back"}
{"text":"First of all, I hate parking and driving uptown or anywhere near uptown, so the fact that this place is RIGHT on the light rail is incredibly convienient. (If you do drive, Luna's does have a big open parking lot. It's not bad, I'm just picky)  The atmosphere and service are fantastic. It has high ceilings, tons of natural light, and really lovely modern decor. Loved our server, she was very sweet and knowledgeable of the menu.   I'm not a vegan, but I'm always looking for good vegan places to take my vegan sister when she's in town. She ordered an iced coffee with her meal and I ordered the best iced chai I've ever had. (seriously, wow)  I love a good veggie burger and I was not at all disappointed with the one I ordered. I've eaten quite a few vegan restaraunt meals with sis but this was my first time eating somewhere that boasts itself as \"raw vegan\". Luna's does a fantastic job blending different flavors and ingredients to create it's dishes and I truly did not miss the absence of meat OR heat in my meal.  I have no idea what raw vegan cheesecake is made of but the berry cheesecake I ordered was incredible  Two drinks, two entrees, and two desserts ran me about $50. I certainly couldn't afford to eat here on the regular, but It was a special night out, so it was worth the splurge."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. Not just in Charlotte, but anywhere. I always leave feeling satiated and I love having the ability to choose anything on the menu without worrying about whether or not it's vegetarian and/or healthy for me.  As far as dishes go, my personal favorite is the Rawco Taco Salad. It is so tasty and I'm completely obsessed. The Living Burrito is a close second, though. Honestly you can't go wrong with any item that you might select from the menu. Every plate is Instagram-worthy and so delectable. The desserts are also exceptionally good! I highly recommend the juice cleanse as well. I tried it and loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is heaven I wish there was more Luna's in the world  the manicotti was so filling and so tasty I had to eat it all in one sitting  the sweet potato sushi with the sauce is addicting I crave it. I loved the living burrito so much I learned how to make my own at home but it still doesn't compare to Luna's. I will be trying more on the menu very soon it's about a 20 minute drive from where I live but it's worth it"}
{"text":"This restaurant proves that you do not need to be vegan to enjoy vegan fare. I think that's really important to note first. The food here is great!   My girlfriend and I met up for a walk on the rail trail one day and at the end of our walk we decided to stop in for a juice. We each got a delicious pressed juice and said we would have to come back for food on a later date.   We'll that date came! And I was really impressed. The server was so sweet. She offered us water (wish it came in larger glasses). We studied the menu. My friend got the kale Caesar salad. I ordered the manicotti.   Both meals came promptly. Her salad was tasty, but the real winner was my dish! The \"manicotti\" was comprised of raw zucchini lasagna zoodles stuffed with cashew cheese and touched with tomato sauce. I got a tossed arugula salad on the side. That cashew cheese was to die for!! No joke! So good! My only wish was that the manicotti could be served warm. I think it would push it over the top -- nonetheless, totally delicious! We ended our meal with 2 chocolate chip cookies and a class of almond milk. The cookies were great. They came warm with lots of nutty flavor. However, I'd pass on the almond milk next time -- too sweet.   The actual space is beautiful and eclectic. It's pretty spacious too.   Nice staff, beautiful space, great food -- if you aren't a vegan don't despair, it's a great choice for lunch! If you are vegan - lucky you because it's such a great example that vegan food isn't scary and can be SO tasty!"}
{"text":"Food is great and service is also wonderful. Great place for vegans and not only . Truly enjoy dining here  hemp milk is also made here , no refined  sugar added . Just heaven for people who  like healthy food . Also desserts are amazing"}
{"text":"I love everything on this menu!  To help you narrow it down... the cheese plate is a MUST! Go ahead and order extra bread and crackers right away because you'll need them.   The raw pad Thai is a usual fav for me. One time it came out a touch bland but typically its full of flavor.   The Kale Caesar is excellent and remember to add the trumpet bacon! Great addition to the flavors of the Caesar. The mini size is generous.   My favorite sandwich was the un-tuna but I think they took it off the menu.  Everything on the menu is made in house and fresh. You really can't go wrong here. Bring friends so you can split several options."}
{"text":"I flew in to CLT for the day and decided to stop by Living Kitchen for lunch. I sat outside and soaked up some sun and my server came over about 10-15 minutes later and apologized for the wait. I was not upset at all since I had no plans. I literally flew in from Orlando to ride Fury325, and then was going to fly back later in the afternoon. I was in no rush. He felt so bad that I had been waiting and told me that he was going to take care of my bill. I did not let him do this because I didn't feel it necessary. The gesture was very nice. We chatted for a little bit and I really enjoyed the atmosphere and of course the food. I will definitely be visiting Living Kitchen the next time I visit Carowinds. Thanks again for the amazing service, Joe!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I've only dined in once but had to immediately get take out the next day. Vegan options galore! I had the basil avocado sandwich on the best bread I've ever tasted with the Caesar side salad that has kale croutons. Heaven. The service was ok and the reason for the 4 stars. We were sat immediately we mentioned we had never been there before so I was hoping for a little more explanation of the menu but she was nice none the less. I ordered my sandwich without the vegan sour cream and onions but they came out on the sandwich anyway. The sour cream worked out and was delicious but I absolutely hate onions. Other than that the place was a definite return and soon at that. They have a great selection of juices in the cooler for taking with you and I have stopped in frequently for just those since as well. It's only a tad pricey but I guess that's the way it is now you have to pay for clean healthy food and at Luna's living kitchen it's worth it."}
{"text":"Bright, cheery place with a sit-down, yet upscale casual vibe.  Very good vegan food, with an emphasis on raw.  What's nice about Luna's is relative to other Raw Vegan restaurants, this is less grab-and-go, and more of sit down, enjoy a good meal, be seen, view the scene, etc.  They make an effort at artful presentation, the greens are all fresh, and the servers very polite and welcoming.    Luna's is located in an upscale shopping center adjacent to an Anthropologie, and their menu features a wide range of smoothies (from green to berry to cacao), to juices, salads, raw dishes (e.g., manicotti), breads, and desserts.    I tried the raw taco salad, which was excellent. The \"meat\" is made of walnuts, and the salsa is terrific.  Fresh avocado, black sesame seeds, crisp romaine lettuce, and gluten-free (I believe) taco shell round out the experience.  The salsa's raw onions are a little heavy if you're considering this and on a date night, however.  ;)  I loved the popeye smoothie, which is infused with hemp protein and spinach, so very good for your vegan muscles.  The apple juice and banana make it sweet and eminently palatable.  Finally, because how can I not go overboard, I had the falafel sampler.  Loved the pickled vegetables and hummus dip (crudite), although the baked falafels were a bit too far from regular falafel for my tastebuds."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Luna's Living Kitchen back when no one knew about it, over 6 years ago (when they were in their smaller location).  Today I got a protein smoothie, the Popeyes Punch, which is my favorite. I decided to sit on the patio and enjoy the nice weather. After a few minutes even though I clearly had my smoothie, a server (or maybe hostess) came and told me that she needed the table (while the customers were standing right next to her)!  Not only that, but there were at least 3 other empty tables on the patio! I can understand maybe it was because I had just a smoothie but a paying customer is a paying customer and there was no need to kick me off the table like that. I can't say that I'm going to boycott but that just rubbed me the wrong way. This is what happens when a small business becomes a big one. The loyalty and respect fades away unfortunately."}
{"text":"Not normally into raw food, but the cocoa smoothie & sweet potato sushi were delicious!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. I've been here several times. I usually get the Arugula Harvest Salad which is probably the best salad I've ever had. Anywhere. The Kale Caesar is amazing. I've also had the manicotti which was great. The TURTLE CAKE is small but SO GOOD. Overall great menu, great healthy tasty food."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food. They master the raw lifestyle! Beautiful restaurant and amazing service! One of the best raw-sterants in the nation!"}
{"text":"This place has such a nice atmosphere. Best hangout spot in Charlotte! All of their food and drinks are Vegan. I've tried the Avocado & Basil Sandwich with the side of Oyster Mushroom Kale Salad and the Ogre and Pinko Drinko smoothies. Best food and drinks I've had in a while. I also tried the berry cheesecake, what a treat. I can eat that all day everyday. Everything they have is so fresh and tasty. They also have a local beer and a good wine selection. I recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a healthy and fresh meal and organic drinks."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! I have had just about everything on their menu, and it was healthy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Good food and juice, but the service is VERY slow when you sit in and order. The veggie burger is spicy and savory and delicious, and the monkey bites are sweet and decedent."}
{"text":"Small portions and too expensive. Service was great though. I had the raw bagel. Had a large portion of avocado, which was nice. Good music"}
{"text":"This place was hands down amazing! The ambiance, the vibe, area and culture that surrounds this place is soooo amazing. The food was to die for made me really think about moving here and being amongst vegan friendly areas such as this. Will definitely call return!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in a while...was missing it. Got a gift card here for Christmas (hooray!). So finally got to come in again. Tried a couple new things. Def worth the shout out...  Appetizer BREAD WITH NUT BUTTER $4 {3 breads to choose from, 3 nut butters to choose from or preserves}  Their bread is amazing. I've said it before but saying it again, because it's that good! I got the cranberry and nut blend bread, yum! With almond butter. It was so good that I ordered a second round. No shame here.   \"GOLDEN MILK\" $7 {tumeric, almond milk, cinnamon} Yes. Tumeric! That's all you need to know. It's so good for you. I got mine iced and sat out on the patio. Perfect!   Wanna go back right now actually. Someone send me another gift card please"}
{"text":"Nice decor. Lots of hippie dippy food options. Came here as part of the Southend Art Crawl.  Ended up having some bread and nut butter appetizer.  This seems more like a coffee type of place to me, but they had sit down food service."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding decoration of the space and food!  Their juices, smoothies, appetizers, main dishes, and desserts are all incredible.   So glad they just expanded to Raleigh so folks over there can enjoy their creations as well!"}
{"text":"I could literally sit in this restaurant allllllllllll day if they let me. It is so cute. The painting, furnitures, colors blends well with everything. The bar looked cute, the juice were great and healthy af. I ordered two and took the glass bottles with me. The only weird thing was the pink mushy thing in the salad I ordered. I forgot to ask my server. But overall it was delicious. Big portion, everything was fresh, would definitely go again. Service was great, friendly, clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Luna's is a great place for a non-vegan to try something new. I've had three different good items and a couple different types of smoothies in the times I've been heat and liked everything I tried. Every time I bring someone new to Luna's, they are shocked by how much thy like it. Literally never heard a bad thing about this place. Also, the smoothies are surprisingly filling!"}
{"text":"Luna's is my go-to spot when I've been eating like absolute crap and need a reset. It's like an apology to my body. A very delicious apology.   My go to order is the Living Burrito but sometimes I like to mix it up with the Pad Thai. The juices are great, too, and at times I use them as meal replacements.   The hot sauce that accompanies the Living Burrito gives me life. If you like spicy, you'd love this sauce.  The service is always top notch and the (newish) space is gorgeous with plenty of natural light."}
{"text":"We have been on a whole foods, plant based diet for 7 months and with the help of several wonderful blogs and books have nailed cooking for this lifestyle.  Unfortunately, Luna's living kitchen has not. After seeing the number of great reviews, we were quite excited to try a vegan, gf, option.  The food was not seasoned well. Less salt is fine but must be compensated with other spices. The price was outrageous given the cost of the ingredients without offering a side dish with the meal.  I am saddened by this experience as the money spent here could have gone to better use.  In addition to the food, the ac was cranked to frigid... so much for low carbon footprint."}
{"text":"It's clear why people would choose to come here.  This restaurant is bright, cheerful and all about healthful fresh food options.  And, it's on a corner in the trendy SouthPark area.  My food selection was the arugula salad with cabbage and avocado and strings of carrots so long that they could stretch to the SC line.   It was good. The Thai tea that I ordered had to be made by the glass.  It was $3.50, which is just too much for a glass of tea. Plus, it took too long to get to the table.  My lunch partner had coffee that was luke warm and tasted stale.   So happy to have dined here, but don't feel a huge urge to return.   There are other good options for fresh food in Charlotte that are more reasonably priced.  You may need to come here, though, to find the strings of carrots that stretch to SC."}
{"text":"I have been vegan for 5-1/2 years, and this is one of the best vegan restaurants I've ever been to.  The staff and service are amazing, and the food is flavorful and beautiful.  Highly recommend the sweet potato sushi, tomatico tart, fire and brimstone burger, pumpkin pie cheesecake and lemon berry cheesecake.  If they have it, the roasted cauliflower soup with rosemary is addictive.   Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Nothing quite like this place in Charlotte.  You can tell this in the very first moments of entering and especially on a weekend at lunch.  People love this place and there's good reason.  Fresh ingredients and a creative kick to otherwise bland and boring dishes.  I was bowled over at how much I actually liked the meal I had and since have had even after my first visit.  Interiors are open and light is abundant by way of the large windows.  Trendy interiors compliment the rustic brick and wood accents.  Parking is a bit of bear here with the entire Afton Mill area having other great things like the market and Savory Spice Shop as well as Big Ben's."}
{"text":"Great vegan option! Between the two of us we split the sweet potato sushi roll, living bagel, bbq mushroom sliders and the turtle cake and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place three stars only because everything is cold! Even the temperate inside they had the air on and it was 30° outside. Yes the eventually turned it off, but to have air on in the  middle of winter is a bit much.   I ordered the special soup starter {sweet pea soup} it was really good and hot! I ate it so fast, just so it wouldn't become cold due to the air blowing directly on me. Then for my entree I ordered the Lunasagna that came with a a side salad. It was great tasting I just couldn't get past how cold it was and how cold I already was even with my jacket on {i.e. I had on a The North Face}.   I understand the concept and reason why they have cold food but a cold restaurant? I need a bit more of an explanation for that in the winter. Especially if the chefs are not using heat to cook there's no need to keep them comfortable if that were the case."}
{"text":"YUM!  I love Luna's Hemp Dressing so much I keep bottles at the office and home. There was a mix up the first time I went in and I waited for a long time to get someone to notice me.  Which is strange I was sitting at the bar.  However, once someone realized I was there the situation was quickly fixed.   The open concept is really cool but gets a little loud.  Food makes all of it worth it."}
{"text":"A must visit if you're in Charlotte!  Really as good as it gets from a vegan prespective.  Don't look anywhere else.  Fabulous food.  Nice wine, great deserts all vegan.  Just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Got small plates and the grey hulk smoothie. All that was ordered was delicious! Beautiful restaurant that I definitely wish was in Richmond, Virginia also!"}
{"text":"If you're vegetarian-definitely check this place out! If not--definitely check this place out! Lol I was very satisfied with this restaurant. The atmosphere was very serene and the open decor was terrific. My food was great and very fresh. I ordered the avocado and basil sandwich on multi grain bread with a side of the broccoli Waldorf. As an appetizer I had a vegetarian version of a clam chowder which was superb!!! But the owner/manager was the spotlight!! She made my visit 10x better. Very observant and personable. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. There is no better way to put it! Yes, the food is raw. But even better, it is amazingly delicious!!  I always have issues selecting what I want to try, and tend to end up with old faithful - their raw pad Thai. Whatever sauce they put on it is true magic. It is satisfying with just the right amount of spicy kick - and the serving size is huge!  I also ventured for the 'mint to be' smoothie to go for my car ride to Raleigh this afternoon. It was delicious and kept me full for the rest of the day.  Decent prices considering the specialty of this food and amazing service. The atmosphere is so cool and chill - makes you want to stay and hang out a while. I cannot wait to come back and try it again soon!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I LOVE Living Kitchen. I just think I had a bad experience with this location.  Living Kitchen is any vegan/vegetarian/raw eater's dream, with plenty of healthy but flavorful options. Their smoothies are amazing too! I have been to quite a few of their locations and loved it every time.  Unfortunately, this location did not live up to the Living Kitchen standards that I have seen at the other locations. I was given a dirty water glass, and my table was not cleaned off. The server was not very attentive, and I waited a very long time for my food to arrive. When it finally came, I did not have silverware and had to wait to get her attention for it. Overall, the service left a bad taste in my mouth. I will definitely give them another chance, as I think I was just there on an off night!"}
{"text":"i love this place!! i used to go to the south end location and now that they have one in south park it's only a hop, skip, and a jump for me to get here! i love how they are committed to being completely VEGAN and ORGANIC! charlotte needs more restaurants like this gem. it's always a pleasure coming here again and again and again!!!! you must try the golden milk if you like indian spices, the muesli and parfait if you are here for breakfast, all of the juices and smoothies are good, and the lunasangna is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Luna's twice now, once for lunch and once for Sunday brunch.  When I came for lunch I had the Arugula Harvest Salad and I loved it! When we first sat down, I was pretty hungry, so I was worried this wouldn't be enough food, but it was surprisingly filling and very delicious. That same meal, my boyfriend ordered the Fire and Brimstone Burger and said he really enjoyed it and didn't feel like his meal wasn't complete without meat!  More recently I took my parents here for Sunday brunch, a new Luna's offering, because my mom is trying to eat healthier and low sugar.  Per my recommendation she ordered the Arugula Harvest Salad and also loved it! I ordered the Muesli and was a little disappointed. It was served in a small bowl and, while filling, was pretty bland and unexciting: not my expectation for Sunday brunch. My boyfriend ordered the Sweet Potato Sushi Roll and was warned upon ordering that it's on the small side (tip for you), so he ordered a cup of their daily soup on the side. My dad, the meat and potatoes guy in our group, ordered the Biblical Breakfast, which he said was fine, but definitely not his favorite either. I think fig preserves and peanut butter was a weird combo personally.  All in all, lunch is great, but if you come for brunch, don't expect a hot meal."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in South End I have to stop at Living Kitchen. The food is amazing, fresh, and most importantly vegan/vegetarian friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed, the decor is clean and modern. The staff is friendly but you won't find them lingering at your table (which is a good thing IMO) My favorites are the Pura Vida juice (orange, apple, lemon, carrot), Living Burrito, & Rawco Taco Salad (its spicy but not unbearable). On my last visit I tried the Mushroom & Broccoli pizza. It was a smaller portion compared to the Living Burrito and Rawco salad but very filling and flavorful. Although I eat a primarily a plant based diet, Living Kitchen is a great lite lunch stop for anyone seeking a meal that makes you feel good and tastes great."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and need a break from fried chicken, steak and other glutinous meals so sought out this gem. Loved my avocado basil sandwich - the hummus was so unique and the veggies were fresh. The side of cole slaw was a little watery so I'd probably opt for another side next time.  I also ordered the arugula harvest salad to go and brought it for lunch the next day (dressing on the side). This was super tasty - fresh, delicious dressing with a little sweetness, and fun ingredients.   This will be a go-to when I visit Charlotte next."}
{"text":"My friends and I came for lunch. We were told it would be a 35 minute wait to be seated. Although I could see it was constantly very busy, but the whole time nearly half the tables were empty so that was confusing. They should add more seats at the bar because a lot of people just ended up ordering takeout since we couldn't get seats. The orders took very long but I have to say the food is very good. I got the living burrito which was great. Very fresh ingredients and the green wrap is such a wonderful alternative to any bread item. It also came with a spicy salsa and a soup. I got the sweet potato chili and that was a nice spicy balance to the cold entree and juice. It can get quite pricey but they are quality ingredients and you will feel good with good food. The chaotic waiting area and wait time were the downside."}
{"text":"I put off eating here for a long time. I was worried the food would be terrible, and that I'd learn this place was only popular because enough people bought in to the hype of raw food.   I'm happy to report I was entirely wrong. The food is so good! I've been several times since my first visit and have tried a few different things. My favorite, by far, is the tomatico tart. I've tried almost all the juices they offer and have liked each of them as well. Sure it's all a little pricey but I think it's a fair price, given the product.   My only complaint is about the coffee: it is terrible, and this is coming from someone who can be content with a mug of JFG.   Otherwise, I like this place a lot and I'm glad I gave it a go!"}
{"text":"Luna's is the perfect place to feed a non-vegetarian/vegan. The food here is incredible, filling and doesn't make you feel like garbage, and that is coming from a guy that smokes meat nearly every weekend. I love this place! (and yes I love meat too!). Try the burrito wrap. It's basically a bunch of stuff wrapped in a collard green leaf, but it's hearty and filling and the sauce is killer!"}
{"text":"Stopped in as an out of town visitor in search of something fresh, green, and tasty. We sampled great desserts and a variety of meals made with sprouted items and fresh ingredients. They also serve wine, beer, fresh pressed shots, smoothies, juices, tea...if I were to visit again it's a must do.We saw everyone from moms with kids to visitors like us."}
{"text":"Amazing and fresh menu. Nonvegan boyfriend was very impressed. Love this place for a dinner that's not too heavy on my stomach."}
{"text":"so excited to have a place like this in charlotte! cannot find a more healthy, homey, friendly, and delicious place to dine. cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent clean food. Highly knowledgeable staff. Great service. Simple beautiful modern environment.   Highly recommended.   Hits were the pad Thai and the broccoli side dish.   Will be back."}
{"text":"I am a total meat eater but went with some friends. For being all raw and all fruits and veggies, it wasn't bad. It actually took someone like me and made me think it was  actually edible. I had a delicious Cesar salad and \"lasagna\". I'd of liked it to be hot but it was still good."}
{"text":"The aesthetics and service are  great.  I ordered the Avocado basil wrapped in a cabbage leaf and Broccoli Waldorf. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian or vegan, but in looking for somewhere healthy to eat this place came up.  I have been pleasantly surprised both times I've been here.  The food, while quite healthy, is very tasty.  The desserts are a little small for the price, but the entrees are a good size and are quite filling.  If you're looking to eat something healthy without sacrificing a lot of flavor, this place really hits the spot, especially if you are trying to avoid gluten.  The sweet potato sushi roll is so good.  The sweet potato mixed with the cashews is not starchy and definitely gives it a great texture.  The tomatico tart is my favorite thing on the menu.  The crust is very rich and tasty, plus the cashew marscapone adds a divine creaminess.  I wish it had just a bit more tomato (because I love tomatoes so much), but it's still ridiculously tasty and filling.  The living burrito is surprisingly large and very filling (who would have thought that raw collard greens could be so tasty?).  I haven't tried any of the juices or smoothies, but they certainly look tasty.  Their menu is relatively small, but the menu items I've tried have been delicious.  The portions are a decent size, as I always leave satisfied.  The wait staff is friendly and willing to make recommendations.  I've been quite pleased on both visits to Living Kitchen, and I definitely think this will be my go-to place when I'm craving something healthy."}
{"text":"Luna's is one of my favorite places to grab healthy food in Charlotte. It's located in Southend. They serve healthy raw vegan food that is absolutely delicious; even if you're a meat lover.  *organic farmers, *seasonal produce, *family-owned farms, *organic, *living food, *plant-based cuisine  I love their coconut milk lattes. They are rich, creamy, and full of flavor!  I've been there several times. I usually go with their arugula harvest salad. The salad has arugula, red cabbage, spriralized root vegtables, avocado, pear, caramelized pecans, pumpkin seeds, raisins, homade cashew basil cheese (The cashew basil cheese literally tastes like legit cheese!) and maple mustard vinaigrette. I like to have falafel added on top. Their salads are giant, which I love, because they fill you up all day. The vegetables are always fresh and ripe.   I also like their tree of life juice. I'm obsessed with the jars that their juices come in. I like to keep them for to-go drinks and around the house. I usually drink their juices before a race.  They had a new item on the menu, sweet potato sushi! It had red bell peppers, cucumbers and arugula wrapped with sweet potato rice and nori leaves and garnished with a lightly spiced Thai chili sauce. I highly recommend these too!   Their whole grain vegan bread with almond butter is also a delicious side in the morning with their coffee.   Their collard green wrapped quinoa burgers are also a great option!  Another favorite of mine is the Lunasagna. It has layers of tender, crisp zucchini noodles, cahsew basil cheese, sun-dried tomato sauce and mushrooms. It's also served with a side salad. The Lunasagna was really good and I didn't think I'd like it because it was cold, but it was perfect!  Ive also ordered the avocado and basil sandwich. It was filled with fresh organic slices of avocado, tomato, onion, sprouts, basil, homemade lemon parsley hummus and cashew sour cream wrapped up in a collard green. You have the choice of vegan multigrain bread or collard greens. I like the collard greens because they are thick and strong; they don't fall apart like iceberg lettuce wraps. For my side, I had their broccoli Waldorf salad. It consisted of diced broccoli, green apple, celery, walnuts, raisin, red onions, homemade chasew mayonnaise, and lemon juice. I don't know how they do it because it didn't taste vegan. I felt like I was eating a summer broccoli waldorf salad drenched in mayonnaise. I'm so impressed.   I love Luna's atmosphere, their staff is very friendly and helpful, and the service is quick! I can't wait to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I had the fire and brimstone burger  And my wife had the lasagna and they were great! I'm not vegetarian but that burger was great. We will visit this place again when we're in Charlotte."}
{"text":"To start, our waitress Cassandra (I think was her name) was so helpful. She was knowledgeable and friendly! I ordered the manicotti. It was everything I was expecting. Zucchini \"pasta\" with creamy cashew cream and a perfect tomato sauce on top. So good! My Omni date ordered the living burrito. He ate every last bite, and then finished my manicotti. We ordered the cheesecake for dessert and the golden milk. So yummy. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte! A great environment, always great service and an exceptional dining experience.  If you are looking for a healthy meal, look no further. Luna's offers a wide range of salads, entrees and appetizers to appeal to anyone's taste. They also have smoothies, cold press juices and make a fabulous Chai tea latte.  Looking for a way to kick start a new weight loss program or eating routine, try their juice cleanse. You will feel great and clean out the toxins from your body.  Luna's has an outdoor area for dining when the weather is nice and plenty of space to park you car or bike."}
{"text":"Fantastic 100% organic food.  Service was poor. I want to see more restaurants providing healthy food choices.  I hope the service will improve."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was amazing!! I got the Avocado and Basil sandwich with the kale cesar salad as a side. The sandwich alone was absolutely fantastic!! The salad was okay but not worth the extra money. I got the chocolate chip cookies and almond milk for dessert and it was $6.50, I got two very small cookies that didn't taste like chocolate chip and a small glass of almond milk. I would go back for the sandwich but not for anything else I got."}
{"text":"As a vegan, I've been to many high-raw, health oriented vegan restaurants.  And while the food is usually good, I usually leave with an empty wallet and still-hungry stomach.  Not the case here.  Sure, the food isn't McDonald's inexpensive, but it's the right price for the quality of food and portion size.  And the food is delicious!  The fire and brimstone burger is one of the top 3 veggie burgers I've ever had.  My dining companion's enjoyed their mock tuna salad and living bagel as well.  The sides were also excellent.  I could have eaten at least 2 more portions of the beet salad and the broccoli waldorf salad was excellent as well.    I took off a star because I thought it took a little longer than usual for our food to arrive.  Our waitress, while efficient, wasn't especially friendly.  But next time I'm in Charlotte I'll definitely be back here for a bite!"}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time last night. While I am not vegan or vegetarian, I definitely appreciate what Living Kitchen is doing, and had a great experience. I can't see myself rushing back anytime soon, just because the food is not really my style. Let's start with the pros -   -atmosphere - GORGEOUS. One of the most beautiful spaces I've been in here in Charlotte. Reminds me of the new Suffolk Punch that's just down the rail trail. Lots of natural light, beautiful plants, bold and bright artwork. Absolutely stunning. I also love that there are cushions and pillows on the seats. My party last night had a baby and we didn't even need a highchair because he was comfortable between his parents in the soft booth!  -service - exceptional. Started the evening with one wonderful woman, who was really kind and genuine and made us feel so welcomed and relaxed. Her shift ended halfway through our meal and we had another sweetheart come over to take care of us! They were both so accommodating and attentive - best service I've had anywhere, in a long time.  -prices - reasonable. You're getting clean, healthy, vitamin-rich food here - that stuff doesn't typically come cheap. I was surprised that the entrees were not pricey in the slightest. The smoothies are, granted, about $9-10, which is crazy high for a drink, but one of the girls I was with ordered one and it looked pretty darn good.   -food - eh. I'm torn because it's really just not my jam. I ordered the manicotti, which is an awesome concept! Zucchini \"noodles\"  - how cool. But sadly, cold manicotti is not something I'll be craving anytime soon. The sauce was good, the plate was pretty, but the cheese did not have any flavor whatsoever (not sure if it was vegan cheese or what) and the noodles would have been better hot. I get it, it's raw food. Doesn't mean I have to love it.  Luna's, you're awesome, and I'm so glad you exist for when vegan/vegetarian friends are in town, like they were last night. Just hope it doesn't hurt your feelings when I get to fly solo and choose a BBQ spot instead ;)"}
{"text":"I've drooled over pictures and reviews of Luna's Pad Thai for years. I finally paid them a visit and experienced the raw, vegan interpretation of one of my favorite Thai dishes... I'm happy to report, I was not disappointed! The spiraled veggies were flavorful and crunchy. The cilantro, lime and crushed peanuts pulled in all the flavors of traditional Pad Thai. And, the sauce everything was tossed in was delicious! Sweet, spicy, savory and tangy all at the same time. My only complaint is the price point at $15.00 seems a little high for this dish. I'm a fan though and will be back for sure when I can afford to splurge!"}
{"text":"I went for a 6 mile run before running to this location and getting the El Luchador smoothie. What a great way to end the run! They were out of hemp milk, so I asked for it to be made with coconut milk, and it was still great! I would be interested to try the food here, but I can already tell it's a one of a kind place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Holy delicious! I never knew I could enjoy vegan or vegetarian food sooo much! Luna's makes eating healthy fun and different which makes it that much more interesting.   First off, the. Restaurant itself is great...it's so clean inside, the employees are really friendly, and they have indoor and outdoor seating. I would say the inside decor is somewhat hippish but it's not so overboard that you feel awkward if that's not your thing. It's very inviting inside and they have some near artwork up.   Secondly, the food!!!! Amazing! I got the a avocado and basil sandwich but instead of bread got it wrapped in collard greens. Omg I could not get enough. It had so many different tastes, the most prominent one being freshness! The hummus added a richness to it and even though it's now a lot of food, that definitely helps to feel more full after. Everything from the onions to the sprouts to the tomatoes made this sandwich. And how could you forget the a acacia, yum! I could eat them plain and be satisfied so this only made it that much better! You get a side with every sandwich so I got the kale salad, again deelicious, especially the dressing.   And then dessert...oh man. Got the berry lemon cheesecake, so good!!!! And again tasted so fresh! I really liked the pecan crust, completely different than \"normal\" cheesecake but it almost felt healthier....almost.   I cannot wait to go back and try pretty much everything but specifically the burgers!"}
{"text":"This is hands-down my favorite place to eat. The food is presented beautifully, the food is delicious, and everything digests so nicely (refreshing for someone with a rubbish digestive system)."}
{"text":"Love the decor and the space. Get to try kombucha beer for the first time. Food is excellent. Staffs are amazing. Great energy.   Charlotte knows it's vegan/ raw game. #hatsoff"}
{"text":"Gluten Free: Yes Casein Free: Yes Vegan: Yes Raw: Yes  Places like Luna's Living Kitchen are a beacon of shinny hope for those with an autoimmune disorders and or any food allergies. To be able to walk into any restaurant and order anything off of the menu without fear of cross contamination is a great thing.  The menu offers a nice selection to choice from. The ingredients are fresh and filling. Their vegan cashew-basil cheese was great. I almost felt like I was eating regular cheese.   Price wise, most of the options at Luna's are reasonably priced for the quality and quantity that you get. Where this differs is for their coffees and deserts. If you choice to indulge in some of these options, expect your bill  to be a bit higher."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this restaurant, and i have finally made it 3 years later. South end charlotte has been booming, the once sleepy mill is now alive, edgy and hip.  Herbs as \"flower\" that adorns each table. They use this home made lemon spritz as cleanser, very biodegradable.   My only complaint is the waiter (dark straight hair, fair skin) was not super friendly. But with that aside. This restaurant is everything it promises. Sustainable, support local organic farmers. Clean vegan eating.   The purple rain juice i ordered was vey refreshing. My mom ordered the pho and portion wise it was kind of small. They pour the broth in after they put the entree on the table. The broth has good flavor.   They give you a glass jar with filtered(?) water on each table.   Bathrooms have not been remodeled. The paintings that adorn the wall are pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Food is soooo good, but service is sooooo bad! :( it makes me want to not ever go back! Apparently I choose to dine in at a bad time for them. They should close their kitchen if they don't have enough servers."}
{"text":"Get your daily serving of greens by drinking My Daily Salad, one of the many pasteurized juice choices. Good stuff 4 real!!"}
{"text":"We've had some good food while visiting Charlotte and surrounding areas but this was probably my favorite meal. No one in our party is vegetarian or vegan and we all thoroughly enjoyed our food. They have an incredible menu, definitely something for everyone and everything that we tried was delicious. I had the pad Thai (everything in it is raw) sooooo good, that sauce was perfect. My husband and dad got the veggie burger and my mom tried the curry bowl, each thing was better than the last. Their unsweetened lemonade was delicious and refreshing as well as the chocolate chaga. I'm a big fan of matcha and was very excited to try the matcha Latté with coconut milk but I didn't like it at all, however everyone else in our party of 4 (all of them who usually don't like matcha) LOVED IT. So maybe it was just me.   This place was a last minute find and only because our flight home was delayed by 2 hours. I must say living kitchen was well worth the delay.j"}
{"text":"As an avid meat eater, I was a bit skeptical about dining at a place that doesn't include meat as a staple on the menu. I had the sweet potato and pear soup which was creamy and full of flavor. For my entree, I had the broccoli Waldorf salad. It was AMAZING! I was so full after my meal and j couldn't believe that I didn't have any meat! This will be a regular stop for me during my business trips to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I typically avoid vegan food (a girl needs her protein!) but Luna's is absolutely delicious. They also have a lot of gluten free options (and a dedicated prep area. Just make sure you let the server know when you order.   I love the atmosphere here- you really can't go wrong with eating inside or on the patio!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED Living Kitchen!! The food and service here is amazing. I'm not a vegan but I am a health nut, so I certainly swooned over the food. Last time we were in Charlotte we dropped in for some lunch and were kept full the rest of our road trip thanks to their delicious food!   I got the manicotti, which I was skeptical about being served cold with veggie noodles, BUT this was amazing! The veggie noodles are tender and the cashew cheese inside is creamy and decadent. Yum!    I love the light-filled atmosphere of this place with all the plants trendy fixtures. We dined in and our server was so nice with a great attention to detail. They even gave us some ice for leftovers bag to keep our food cold until we reached home. This restaurant is a gem and I would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I've always loved Luna's and have been a long time customer since it first opened. The new location is bright, modern and much larger than the original spot which is a good thing because every time I stop in the place is packed! I love supporting small vegan restaurants and it makes me happy to see Luna's expanding this location and also opening their new Raleigh location. Love the food but have been disappointed on the service during my last few visits :(   Hopefully it's just been bad luck? I definitely recommend and always get the Fire & Brimstone Burger in a collard leaf wrap Salad w/hemp dressing Lentil Soup Hulk Smoothie"}
{"text":"the food is amazing! I love the Biblical Breakfast as well as the Incredible Hulk Smoothie but my issue is with the staff. I walked in and was not greeted I sat my self down to wait for my food that I had ordered then I waited for 20 minutes for my food but not once did anyone acknowledge my presence! I noticed that there was food sitting on the counter but I assumed that someone would eventually ask me what I was waiting for or how could they help. I eventually had to ask the young lady if that was my food and left. I love this restaurant but the staff needs more work"}
{"text":"Absolute favorite restaurant. I'm not even a vegan but I am a foodie and appreciate excellent food. I go here every time I am in charlotte, great for every meal! My all time favorite is the tomato tart and sweet potato sushi roll, but honestly you can't go wrong with anything!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is nicely designed with great energy.  The meals are creative and tasty.  The juice drinks are pricey in my opinion but we order them anyway because they are very good!"}
{"text":"This establishment is amazing! I enjoy my meal each time, however, I will say this. I came for my first time last week and when I found the site on google, it only started vegetarian options so I really wasn't sure if they had vegan options when I first came, so of course I double check and ask the waitress if there is any dairy used... she gives me a funky look (I mean I'm sorry that's it's my first time here and you've worked here a while) and says \"well vegan is a form of vegetarian,( which doesn't answer the question and isn't an accurate or friendly response )  so I just ordered, but I will ask to inform your servers there is a difference if any customer asks specifically for vegan. Thankfully they are completely vegan and I know this now, which I will continue to come here often, but for someone who may possibly come in with the same question, they should be given a less confusing answer. Perhaps \"we are plant based, so yes we meet vegan standards\""}
{"text":"If you're a vegan.....go here. If you're a vegetarian....go here! If you're a meat lover I'm not sure how you'll feel about this place. I'm super picky when it comes to vegan food because it has a reputation for tasting like cardboard. Not here. Everything is delicious. My favorite is the fire and brimstone burger on a collard leaf and a cacao cacao smoothie (I swear it tastes like a chocolate milkshake)."}
{"text":"What can you say about Luna's. It's a staple for vegan and raw food.  The juices are a bit sweet for my taste (but not from added sugar, just from using more fruits than veggies) but Luna's easily has one of the best lunches in Charlotte.  The salads and wraps are world class."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some elixir shots and tea! Good atmosphere. Nice music. Trendy hipster scene.  Customer service was horrible"}
{"text":"Love this place . The service can come across a little unfriendly sometimes but the food and smoothies are creative, delicious, and make you feel good about what you're putting into your body"}
{"text":"Well, the quality, creativity & service were very good, but the amount of time it took us to get our meal was terrible. It was a Friday afternoon (after Thanksgiving) @ 2pm & we left about 3:45pm.  We ate outside on the patio so that our party of 5 could be seated immediately. They had outdoor heaters which made it possible to do this!  We started with the sweet potato sushi; very clever & tasty. I got a mock tuna salad sandwich with a side of cauliflower rice. The sandwich was good.  Two of the diners got the avocado BLT sandwich; one liked it more than the other. The \"bacon\" was a mushroom concoction. Pad Thai was another entree...it was alright. The Waldorf salad side was a hit. Got a Pinko Trinko smoothie which was really good. And lastly, my Mom got the zucchini manicotti with cashew cheese. She said it would've been great if the zucchini were at least warmed, if not grilled. It was an aesthetically pleasing meal if anything! I would certainly go back, but not if I was in a hurry or super hungry."}
{"text":"I'm by no means vegetarian or vegan but I do like to eat healthy on occasion.  We wanted to try a new spot so here we are!  The restaurant is super clean and really nice.  We got the sweet potato roll appetizer, BLT, and avocado sandwich.    Everything came out promptly and was really delicious and healthy.  We had excellent service and will definitely come back because I want to try that pizza...."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  I ordered the Living Burrito.  It almost had the taste of tuna salad wrapped in collard greens.  I had the soup of the day which was chili and the two matched perfectly.  The chili had a nice hot spiciness to it.  For a drink I had the chocolate chaga which was like chocolate milk yet made with almond milk.  The service was really good once we had a server which took about 10 minutes.  Really my only gripe.  The restuarant is clean and nicely decorated.  Will definately come back here for a filling healthy meal."}
{"text":"This is the best vegan option in the Charlotte area! Great entree's, salads, juices, smoothies, beer and wine! The salads are huge and you can add a veggie burger or mushroom bacon. The \"tuna\" salad sandwich is awesome pared with the Waldorf salad as a side. Today they had chili as the soup of the day with just the right amount of spice. This is a favorite lunch stop when the hubby and I are out on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"I just noticed I never reviewed this place - well let's rectify that situation. I'm giving it three stars because it was good but I won't be back. I understand that it's hard to find a good vegan place and based on other reviews it seems like this is what that looks like. My mom and I came to Luna after I picked her up from the airport one afternoon back in August. We sat outside, the weather was beautiful and our waitress was friendly. I ordered a sandwich, my mom a salad bowl and we shared the \"cheesecake\" for dessert. It seems like everything I ordered had a nut component to mimic the mouthfeel of dairy. I remember the broccoli Waldorf salad was good but I couldn't finish more than a few bits. The meal was fresh and I felt good eating it but I didn't feel full for long. I may just not be the niche customer Luna relies on."}
{"text":"I like that Living Kitchen has healthy vegan food, and doesn't serve the processed fake meat or processed soy. We came here for dinner and ordered:  -Grey Hulk smoothie: 5/5 Naturally sweet and delicious. I would come back just for this.  -Power Pack shots: 4/5 Powerful hits of raw juice! Wish they came in glass shot rather than in plastic bottles though.  -Arugula Harvest Salad: 3.75/5 Pretty decent salad (I love sprouts), but salad is pretty much the default option you get if you're a vegan in a steakhouse, so given so many options at Living Kitchen, I'd order other dishes next time.  -Sweet Potato Sushi Roll: 3/5 Interesting....This is good if you're going for the no carb / no rice diet, but to be honest I've had better vegan sushi (with rice).  -Curry Bowl: 4/5 One of my favorite bowls of the night. Bigger portions than expected.  -Broccoli Mushroom Pizza: 3.5/5 A bit dry. I wouldn't consider it pizza. Think of it more as some toppings on a graham-like cracker crust. I wouldn't order this again.  Service was friendly and attentive as well. I would come back again for healthy vegan food in my future travels to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've been a raw vegan for 3+ years and this is the best damn raw food restaurant out there. Please come to NYC or contact me and teach me how to open one and I'll do it myself!!! This place is pure magic!!! Thanks"}
{"text":"I don't even like Vegan food, but it is impossible not to like Luna's offerings.  The juices are spectacular.  The entire experience is a delight.  I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time trying vegan & I was very pleased. I loved the triple play hummus & the kale Caesar salad but didn't care too much for the pizza. I'd definitely go back again & take a friend."}
{"text":"First time here, and I was impressed. They offer more than salads, juices, smoothies, and kale-whatever in this restaurant specializing in plant based cousine. I had the Fire & Brimstone burger with a side of Caesar salad. Surprisingly, the meal was filling as the 'burger' was tasty and creative with a hint of heat. You would feel pretty good coming out of this place, knowing you ate healthy even though it can put a dent in the wallet if you go all out. I plan to try things little by little as part of going meatless once per week. Be careful to your nut allergy folks as there are many nut substitutes here."}
{"text":"Love their food although really pricey. Staff are helpful for new people who need help navigating the menu. Since they added wine it's even better for dinner option. I've eaten breakfast lunch and dinner here and love it all"}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Fresh, healthy, hearty food that is presented beautifully! The Pad Thai is sauced to perfection with a good amount of spice and veggies! The \"cheese\" plate is a meal on its own and a perfect combination of flavors and textures. Yola Mango smoothie is my favorite snack or meal replacement, not too sweet and really fills you up!"}
{"text":"Best juice cleanse in Charlotte! Quality of ingredients is top notch--all organic, in glass bottles and you even get an awesome reusable insulated bag. We juice as a group twice a year during a conference and McKenzie is always super nice and accommodating with last minute orders/swapping juices, etc. WE LOVE LUNA !!"}
{"text":"Maybe I caught them on an \"okay\" day because I just thought it was, well, okay. I ordered the raw Pad Thai and it took about 40 minutes to get to my table...and it wasn't particularly buzzing at the time so my cousin and I were really confused.  The presentation was really pretty, but not 40 minutes pretty.   Taste was not bad. I suppose as someone who eats cooked food regularly my palette for raw food is probably much different than someone who lives a raw lifestyle and consumes raw foods exclusively. That being said, I'm sure this place is a gem for them. For someone with many more options, I thought it was a little overpriced and not entirely worth the wait either"}
{"text":"If you're vegan or vegetarian, this is your heaven. I am neither of these things, but I am still a big fan. There's really nothing else like Living Kitchen here in Charlotte.   My absolute favorite thing here: the volcano juice (orange, lemon, grapefruit, maple syrup, cayenne). Food-wise, I usually get the Fire & Brimstone burger (gluten free quinoa veggie burger spiced with sunflower hummus, onion, cucumber, guac, homemade hot sauce). You can get it on bread or wrapped in a collard leaf.   The inside is beautiful. Cozy tables along with a long community one. Stools along the bar-like counter. Nice patio if you want to be outside.   I noticed a few people comment about both the price and the fact the food is all cold. Come on people, it's raw. And this isn't McDonald's."}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant it's very artsy and the food is good and the service is really nice 10/10 a good first experience they served us really good the menu had a wide variety of foods even though it's a vegan place. It's in a really weird location, took us a while to find but the location is really far and we live kind of far.Would really recommend."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that claims to be all natural, I found the people working there extremely self absorbed and unable to even greet guests. Even fast food restaurant workers treat their guests with more cheer. Never coming back.."}
{"text":"Luna's offers a wonderful selection of vegan and mostly raw food selections. You feel good about everything you eat there, and I always leave feeling nourished and ready to continue doing my body right.  For this reason, I enjoyed going here for lunch the other day. I ordered the avocado basil sandwich and seriously considered asking to purchase a loaf of their bread to take home. It's so good! I also had a tasty beet salad. I really appreciate the diversity of cuisines and styles of food represented on their menu, from small plates to tacos to lasagna to sandwiches. I feel like I can always find something I can eat here.  Definitely a unique joint that I recommend checking out!"}
{"text":"So far my second best vegan place in the nation! ... and they have two locations which is so convenient, especially for like me that work in downtown and live in the suburbs. First and foremost, kudos to the servers in the Fairview location, they rock!!! Super friendly, they all know very well their menus and how to explain taste profile to those not so vegan friendly, if you get served by Jesus he is the best! The food here is very very tasty, they can go a little too spicy so make sure you ask your server, they have a very creative menu from the names to obviously the choices. I LOVE LOVE that their desserts are all Gluten Free and the cheesecake berry one is to literally fight for! Another must have desert is their cookies and milk, the almond coconut mix milk is super rich and delicious. My best dishes are the avocado toast sandwich (so glad they kept it in their now new menu), the quesadilla with mushroom carnitas , and omg their burger is a must try! Their drinks and smoothies are really natural, clean and fresh. Also very creative flavor combinations, be ware with the ginger one as it is very spicy and will leave you hot hot hot! I love their little center pieces always with fresh wild flowers, their plates and glass collection is super cute too. I love they do not serve water with ice unless you ask. People, water is intended to be drank 'al natural'. They only advise and heads up I have is related to their prices. Desserts average around $9 per plate, entrees around $12-$16 and with exception of their salads, their portions are not big, just enough. For me it's perfect and coming from the North East I see these all priced fairly, but for the portions and considering  most dishes carry lots of leaves it can be considered in the pricier end. I LOVE LOVE their branding, vision and concept. They are definitely game changers and challenge the status quo of the restaurant industry. They have come to join the food and sustainability revolution and I love it!!! Keep up the great work and much more success your way!"}
{"text":"Joint the rewards club, it is a great benefit of discounts. Food has been consistent, fresh and delicious. Service has been responsive and friendly. A+"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?!   I've officially made my way through the menu and not a single meal has disappointed.   If you're gluten free or vegan, you know we spend a lot of time looking for places to eat and most restaurants would much rather us look elsewhere lol  The staff is awesome, the food is quality!  Don't leave without having the dog jam or amazing cashew spread on something!"}
{"text":"Never been in  vegan restaurant before. I'm not vegan and I loved. If all vegan food tastes like that, I will become vegan right now. The ambiance is great, my waiter was patient to explain the menu and their beliefs. Wish this restaurant was all around US."}
{"text":"Hmmm. How I struggle with this review. Let me first say I love the South End local for service and friendly staff though I've only been there once. In the last week I went to South End by accident dang GPS and South Park twice. Now I thank my GPS as I prefer South End even though SP is closer. First 2 times I had the mock tuna and sweet potato/pear soup at both locals. Both amazing. Service at SP was slow very slow since we were the only ones there at the time. 2nd visit to SP. Ordered a drink, then was told they were out. Ok it happens. Ordered BLT and chili. Waited waited then told they are out of the BLT but could sub the mushrooms used for the sliders. Ok I love all shrooms. Waited waited waited (only one other table) food finally arrives. Chili is so spicy it isn't edible. Bite into my BLT....hmmm when they said sub the shrooms I thought they would be prepared like the BLT. Nope. It was the bbq sliders mix. So, bbq with BLT fixings. Nope. Not good. For my trouble and patience they were going to give me a discount which was all of $2.00. I still love LK but SP is not up to par with SE."}
{"text":"Rawco taco salad. YUM! This place is so cute and I can't wait to go back. Love their mission."}
{"text":"The food is good. However, they nickel and dime you for everything. I asked for jam and almond butter to spread on my bread and I was charged for it on my bill! (WTF) in my opinion this place is expensive to begin with.. To charge customers for condiments is BS. Also the amount they gave me was measured in the small black condiment cups restaurants keep on hand... I shall never go back. They lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I find excuses to drive to Charlotte so I can eat at Luna's!  There is no way a human being could eat this beautiful food and not love and appreciate it. Luna's inspires me to be more creative with my own plant based meals. The hemp dressing is addictive and I always bring home a few bottles of it.  I can't wait  to go back and get my favorite kale lemonade.  This place is so very special."}
{"text":"Lunas has wonderful raw gourmet food. I love the lunasagna with the side salad it has a pretty tasty nutty sweet dressing. Also they have great smoothies and raw cheesecake it's a must try."}
{"text":"Amazing Caesar salad and \"tuna\" in collard wrap.  Outdoor and indoor seating.  Very fresh, clean atmosphere.  Clean bathroom (for those of us that judge based on that).  On site parking is convenient.  Everything was fresh and the server did a great job of making recommendations.  New favorite spot."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to eat. Vegan can be great, and Luna's knows how to make such great selections with local and regionally farmed foods. I can not recommend it any higher. It is the best. The staff is amazingly friendly and on top of their service game. Julianna is awesome, what a great culture and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Always a great experience and great natural food. Love Living Kitchen. I have been going to the original location on South Blvd for years and. Ow the South Park location is open it is my go to. The staff is friendly and efficient. Very cool atmosphere. All of the food is sourced local and prepared with care and attention to detail. Superb job by Juliana and team."}
{"text":"Our meals today from Luna's Living Kitchen - so good! Raw, vegan, delicious! All amazing - I don't think you can go wrong with anything here.   Mint to Be Smoothie  The Ogre Smoothie  Rawco Taco Salad  Lunasagna Fire & Brimstone Burger  Cookies & Almond Milk  Tiramisu   That's a lot of food for 3 people, but I'm ok with it :)"}
{"text":"\"Boy am I healthy\" that's how one feels eating here!!  Loved the beet and carrot hummus..Watch out for that lemonademore lemons than ade! Overall wonderful meal."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte on business, and found this place about a mile from one of my clients.   Love the one in Raleigh so figured I'd stop in and have a quick brunch of living bagel and muesli along with one of their juices.    Great place to stop in if you are GF.    Obviously this place caters to vegetarians and vegans, but that should not limit their customers.  If you love good food and trying new things stop in and check them out even if you are not vegetarian or vegan or GF."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and it was empty. Nice change from the South End location which is busy. Staff was friendly, and the decor was nice - looks very much like the other location. Our server was super nice and welcoming, I liked her a lot. I ordered the pad Thai on her recommendation. My first bite in, I felt something in my mouth I initially thought was a seed. It was a sharp piece of plastic! The general manager (I think) came out just to see how we were doing and I showed him what I found. He was apologetic and thought it came from their mixing containers and asked if I was hurt (which I wasn't). They didn't charge me for my pad Thai in the end but still charged me for the wine. I get it, they run a business, but I probably won't ever go back. Finding that sharp plastic piece was alarming, and if I had swallowed it, it would have messed me up."}
{"text":"This place is definitely RAW VEGAN!!! If you want cold food that is trendy, come here! I came with a group of girls and that is not what we were expecting so we weren't too impressed with the food. The pad Thai was good, the lettuce wraps, and rice would have been better warm, and the zucchini manicotti was not our favorite. Next time, when we are looking for healthy vegan- we will not go RAW!   Would highly recommend the lemon- berry cheesecake though!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan but I'm a pretty clean eater. My boyfriend on the other hand is the opposite. A meat loving, junkfoodaphil.   I took him here just to show him that not all vegan food doesn't taste like dirt. He was a skeptic, but when he left he was like \"wow.\" He loved it...  Everything about this place is perfect. I would give a food review but everything is excellent. I alway stop and get juices and shooters for a pick me up.   Even if you aren't a super clean eater, you will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Surprisingly better than I thought..... I'm not sure why I assumed this was going to be a challenging lunch date - but I have to say the atmosphere was great and the menu is simple enough. I actually asked the waiter to provide suggestions around what I should order and the veggie burger was delicious. A good kick of spicy for sure, but hearty and filling. I didn't need a side at all and I was content for the rest of the afternoon. If you're curious, check it out - healthy doesn't have to be just leafy!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times, and have never been disappointed.  It is a busy place sometimes, but worth it in my opinion.  I am not vegan, but do believe in eating that way, particularly organic raw.  It can take some getting used to, versus the standard American diet, but my wife and I have always found it wonderful.  If it were not so difficult to prepare super healthy meals like this at home, we would do it much more. I believe there is now a Living Kitchen in the Raleigh area as well."}
{"text":"Cool space with good fresh food. This is a great place to stop in for lunch. They could use a few more options without nuts because if you can't eat them or don't like them it's tough to find something but otherwise the food is very good."}
{"text":"Sooooo amazing ! I wanted to order everything on the menu. We finally decided on the living burrito and the fire and brimstone burger. Holy moly were they delicious ! We inhaled them both. We even saved room for dessert and order the turtle cake. LIFE CHANGING! I have no idea how they made the cake so delicious and picture perfect. I cannot wait to come back and try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"It has taken me a long, long, long time to write this review. To be transparent, I went to Luna's in May, 2015. I try to write reviews that are fair, so it has honestly taken me time (see aforementioned timeline above) for me to unpack my thoughts about my experience.   I went with my sister whom was visiting from California. She's a vegan, so Luna's was to be a high point of her visit restaurant-wise to the Charlotte area. The ambiance of Luna's is great and our server was delightful. We popped in for a late breakfast after a Pilates class on a Saturday, but by the time we were seated, they had stopped serving breakfast by like 2 minutes. And no, ordering breakfast wasn't a choice at that point because I asked. I had actually really wanted breakfast too, so that started me off on a bad note. I ended up ordering the living bagel along with the purple rain juice. The juice was fantastic, and I can see why they are so popular.   The bagel looked beautiful in presentation, and was pretty darn tasty until I pulled a black wiry curly hair out of my mouth that was enmeshed in my bite of food. I have blonde hair, so it definitely wasn't my hair in my food. Further digging in the bagel revealed another strand of hair. I am guessing that \"living\" part of the name doesn't imply protein filament from the human head. That honestly turned me off so bad that I couldn't finish my meal. I didn't make a big deal of it at the time we were there, but that's because I didn't want to bother our nice server who was super busy.  I think it is definitely fair to say that I am not heading back to Luna's again."}
{"text":"At 5 for sure!!! We enjoyed the food, dessert and drinks! A must to visit for fresh, healthy and clean food!"}
{"text":"Give yourself the chance to go out to eat without feeling overly full and lethargic after. Luna's offers the atmosphere, the flavor, and even the adult beverages that the best restaurants offer, without the guilt!   If you're like me and still discovering healthy food, start out with the Fire and Brimstone Burger and Caesar salad - and then work your way to more adventurous things.  You will be so happy that you did!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best vegan place I have ever tried. I'm not a vegan but I could go here all the time, basically it makes me want to be vegan.   I'm a huge fan of their breakfast. I always get the biblical breakfast, which is amazing!   The look and design of the place is gorgeous. I want to always be there because of it. Lots of natural light and makes for beautiful shots of food (if you're into that)."}
{"text":"Very good.  My husband categorized it as \"foofy\" and, indeed, most of the men looked like they had been dragged there. However, I thought the food was delicious and creative, and almost everything on the menu can be prepared gluten free.  He thought the iced tea was the best he'd ever had.  We strolled down the tracks to the farmers market after lunch and got blackberries, peaches, and a cast iron turtle."}
{"text":"Vegan restaurant, little known secret straight men do love this place when you can get them to try it. Perfect spot for a ladies night, or healthy meat alternative. There is a small patio in the back with a great view of the sunset. Inside they sell goodies \"to go\" vegan snacks, dessert, cookies and juices. Go for the jucies to get the best bang for your buck.   If you have any allergies they will make sure to prepare your food appropriately. My friend had a nut allergy and the server was happy to accommodate him, even seemed excited at the idea of creating something for him."}
{"text":"A friend chose this place due to all the talk about it. Well it was terrible, just terrible. Ionized water only no ice, slow service and wait staff that felt they were doing us a favor. The menu is so strange why must you re create hummus isn't that vegan any way. The lowmein-ish salad was odd and cold when it was supposed to be a warm dish. The juice cleanse non sense is so trendy is makes me laugh. Come here and buy over priced prepackaged juice drinks. People if it's pre packed it's not fresh. The only thing was edible was the bread and that was Ezekiel and that was the only thing they didn't make.I mean I understand the vegan trend as it goes hand in hand with the Paleo lemmings but go to Bean if you want good vegan food.  Side bar no one looked happy before, during or after they ate"}
{"text":"This is raw vegan food and not for the faint of heart. They don't even give you ice with your water unless you ask because they are that hardcore! Everything tastes like a remixed salad but it was my first time going raw vegan. I wasn't ready!"}
{"text":"I had visited this place once the last time I was in town, when they were in their old location. The food was phenomenal, the environment was sweet and homie, totally enjoyable but danggggg have they stepped up their game!   This newer space is gorgeous, I mean, really aesthetically perfect! The food was unsurprisingly delish with a great drink menu to boot and the staff was attentive and well educated on their menu, yet not hover-y. Can't say enough about it. Truly perfect."}
{"text":"I wouldn't mind being vegetarian if I could eat at this place all the time!! The food is always good no matter what you order. I ordered the avocado sandwich and it was delicious. Drinks are very refreshing too. I tried the kale lemonade. Would highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place every time I go to Charlotte. Vegan and vegetarian food that makes you crave more.  My latest visit I had the Brimstone burger in a collard green wrap.  Incredibly delicious, plus my beet slaw on the side was also fantastic. Half the wrap and I was full, but of course ate the whole thing. Some kombucha to drink and I was fueled up for the rest of the day. Great atmosphere, friendly servers and efficient service."}
{"text":"Honestly, I had no idea that eating healthy could be so delicious too! I went in just to pick up a shot of \"the antidote\" to help flush out a little cold, but was intrigued by a plate that came out of the open kitchen area. I grabbed a seat at the bar area and decided to give vegan a try.   I ordered the mock tuna salad in a collard wrap with a side of beet salad and there's only one word to describe it, delicious. It was very flavorful, and quite filling. The nut and seed mixture within the mock salad was crunchy and creamy at the same time, reminiscent of the celery crunch and creamy mayo, but without the guilt. I will definitely be back for that, and some other treats again!"}
{"text":"It's not a secret that I don't care for Charlotte, as a City. To me, it's cookie cutter and lacks creative character. That out of the way, I did find something unique that was not here the last time I visited. Living Kitchen is one of the restaurants that popped up on the yelp Radar. The parking in this area is insane. With the district area next to the old train tracks now gentrified and popular, the parking is out of date. It was near lunch and I found this place. It was a wonderful surprise to find such a unique place where Vegans and Vegetarians to dine without stigma and prejudice. I sat at the counter and was assisted by a bright, bubbly young lady, her name is Janet. She helped me figure out a dish and drink. It was truly a unique experience. There is a lot good in any City, but I know when I see and experience something Amazing and this place is it. It's a bit pricey, but if more people ate this way, the demand would justify a price and consciousness shift. If you are in Charlotte, then brave the traffic, the crowds and the noise and find a slice of joy and tantalize your taste buds. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery thru Postmates tonight - I come to Charlotte often for work & have ordered from here before but tonight I was super impressed with my meal. I had the Arugula Harvest salad with falafel & it was delicious but nothing prepared me for the carrot cake which was so amazing, I'm so bummed I have to wait until my next trip to have it again!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I got the Avocado-Basil sandwich on gluten-free sourdough. It was delicious! Atmosphere is great, pretty kid-friendly. Music is somewhat loud, but that's not much of an issue because the food is so amazing! I'm on a diet similar to Paleo, so finding this place was a nice treat! I enjoyed every bite. Even if vegan or vegetarian isn't usually your style, I would recommend branching out and trying this place. Quite worth it, although pricey."}
{"text":"I've been working in Charlotte for a few weeks now and have come here at least once each week and have NEVER been disappointed!! The Caesar salad with kale croutons, the pho (I like it better than the traditional), the fire & brimstone burger!!!, iced house made chai, and the desserts: oh my!!! I don't know what I'm going to do when I leave Charlotte and no longer have Luna's!  I think they should  write a cookbook :)"}
{"text":"Vegan, raw, gluten-free dream come true! Had the hummus trio with raw crackers and cranberry bread for the husband. Fabulous. Had the ginger kombucha beer and the peach bourbon kombucha beer. Fabulous. Carnivore Husband had the manicotti and cleaned his plate. Didn't offer me a bite. I had the rawco taco salad. It was spicy, beautiful, and perfectly delicious. We also had the lemon-berry cheesecake for dessert. Can't wait to go back and try different menu items."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic- you cant go wrong with their Vegan \"tuna\" wrap, their Living Bagel, Green juices,  or their seasonal cheesecakes. If you get a chance, you must make it out there for breakfast- it's divine. Their aesthetic is also very appealing- open kitchen, well-lit, airy, welcoming. Excellent service, and every meal is living art. This establishment has grown so much, I look forward to seeing continued growth and expansion."}
{"text":"Has anyone ever written a bad review about this place? Can I just say ... Amazing. I was a little skeptical due to being a die-hard carnivore but wow. This is the first time I've ever had cashew cheese and it was delicious. The manicotti was phenomenal, especially with the tomato-basil marinara. I also got to taste my sister's pad Thai which was just as good. We will definitely be back. It's amazing how good healthy, raw food can taste. I'm about to order the lemon berry cheesecake and I'm so excited to see how they pull off vegan cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I only stopped in for a smoothie, but what the heck. It was a damn good smoothie. The fruit mix was brought to life by just the right amount of ginger, and it was quite refreshing and filling.  If I had the chance (unlikely), I'd stop back. It was accessible off of the local light rail, and quite large and new-age-y. Not a cheap place by any stretch, but if you're up for indulging in all-vegetarian health food I'd check it out. If you just want a quick smoothie, I'd definitely check it out."}
{"text":"In town for work and was really excited to try this place. Unfortunately, I was disappointed when I sat at the bar and was ignored. After five minutes of several workers looking at me without addressing me I left. I have found many other establishments in town who are friendlier and prompt with thier service which I will give my money to."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in town to eat. Great place to go on a date and the food is amazing. One of my favorite appetizers is the falafels. I have tried many of their entrees and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"A great vegan and raw food spot in Charlotte... the decor is great, the service was wonderful and the food was great... Hannah was our server/bartender and she was very attentive and full of information...   The broccoli waldorf might have been one of the best dishes I've ever had... when we came home my significant other tried to replicate the recipe... couldn't find anything that looked right... then we went to the source and wouldn't you know it, Luna's lists all the ingredients right on their site... so we made some and it was amazing... I love the transparency... the Manicotti was amazing... the only thing I have a knock on was the falafel... however, what I did not realize going in is that everything is raw... falafel is pretty much impossible to make without deep frying it which explained the delta in taste I was looking for...   either way, this is a place I would come to again... love what they stand for, love what they are doing, and their food is great.."}
{"text":"This place seems to be better than I last ate there. The food is pricy, which is reasonable considering it's not your typical fare. Everything I've had was really fresh and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I've heard amazing things about this place but wasn't sure. As soon as I walked in the door I knew it was gonna be an amazing experience. Water was delivered immediately as we sat down which I like. The menu is laid out pretty easily so it shouldn't be hard to figure out what you want. I decided on the Lunasaga. I can't stress how incredibly delicious it is. The sauce was very good and had a great after taste. I also got the local greens salad and I added garlic since I love garlic. Delicious! The dressing is a hemp dressing. It tasted like a mix between a ranch and a Caesar dressing. I'm pretty sure I cleaned my plate in under 10 mins. It was THAT good. Of course I couldn't pass on dessert. I opted for the turtle cake which was rich but not overwhelmingly rich. I promise you, you won't be disappointed. My friend ordered the milk and cookies. You get a choice of milk. She likes regular milk but that wasn't an option. She got hemp milk that I enjoyed. The cookies are chocolate chip. Very moist and delicious. Before you leave, check out the stuff in the fridge by the bar. I got the antidote and the protector shots along with the hemp dressing that was on my salad. My experience was awesome! The service was awesome too! Except a little longer than normal on food, it's absolutely worth it! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Is it corny to say I'll be living at the Living Kitchen?? Oh well! I will be. Especially since this location is close to home!!  It is beyond perfect inside. The decor is modern, bright yet welcoming, a beautiful mixture of pillows, benches and tables. The patio is a bit of heaven on Sharon road. Nice table seating with string lights, a couch sitting area, and small tranquil waterfalls.   The quality and creativity does not go unnoticed. It is absolute freshness with every single bite. Not to mention deliciously and beautifully prepared. I had the living bagel and  the carrot blend of cold pressed juice. Both so great and just so inspiring. It is so special to have a place to come to as a vegan that I can trust everything is made with the same compassion and respect for food and what it can do for us. I appreciate when restaurants hold the same standard of what I would put in my refrigerator. And that is exactly what Living Kitchen is all about.  I will return and plan on working my way through everything on the menu. Also keep in mind the fresh cold pressed juice selection is large in selection, they make smoothies, have coffee drinks, and are very active in the community raising awareness for a healthy lifestyle. Always keep your eye open for these guys! Come support this location of this business! :)"}
{"text":"It is a serene environment with a wonderful menu. I love the chai latte with coconut milk. We sat for Sunday Brunch and I got the living bagel with jalapeños. It was delicious. Usually I order the fire and brimstone burger which is still my favorite item."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome. I have been here a few times when I'm in Charlotte, and I love going back. The food is really well done. I always leave feeling satiated. The food you eat can be as light or as heavy as you want. When I've eaten here for late lunch, I ordered a lighter meal which held me over until dinner. The soups have been amazing, the beet salad is delicious, and the burrito is a winner! I loved that you have the option for the sandwiches to be served as a collard wrap."}
{"text":"Really enjoyable experience. The staff was friendly, the atmosphere is pleasant and clean, & the food was delicious...with good size portions too. We started with a recommended smoothie \"You're Kalein' me\" - it was smooth & refreshing (would def have it again.) Then for the entree we had a Living burrito, with a side of sweet potato pear soup, and the Pad Thai (my fav)..super delish!!"}
{"text":"Didn't have much time before they closed.. or should I say the kitchen closed.  My gps kept saying I was passing it, but I could not see it from the street (passed it from both directions).  I called, spoke with Chrissie or Kristy, who gave excellent directions.  It's located in the Atherton Mill parking lot where there are a bunch of other restaurants - closest is Ice House and is located next to/across from the Farmer's Market.  Now that I know where it is, I will be sure to not get lost and get there when the kitchen is still open to enjoy a full meal.  Apparently the location changed recently and some of their offerings are no more, such as the alkaline water which was a bummer.. but they have carbon filtered water, which i'm not familiar with.. have to research that one.    People hang out and lounge even after the kitchen is closed.. it's a really lax, hip, artsy, healthy atmosphere.. good vibes!  People were super helpful and approachable.  People just came right up to me and spoke, which was really nice.  Prices are super high though.. i've never in my life purchased a pint? (approximately) of fresh juice for over $10.. that is insane!  but.. I wanted to give them a shot and support their local business.. all organic and vegetarian.  I chose the juice with beets, kale, spinach, orange, lemon, ginger and... not sure if i'm forgetting something or not.  I'll be drinking it tomorrow at work.  Never had beets before, so it should be an interesting experience.  Will update more later."}
{"text":"I normally go to the Southend location but visited here with a friend. Sat on the patio and it was perfection. I tried the BBQ sliders and was amazed with how much flavor they had, would definitely order again! Also, the berry cheesecake is divine!!  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"If someone invites me to lunch or breakfast or coffee chances are I'm going to choose Luna's. There are two convenient locations in South end and another in South Park.  Easy to get to from uptown, Elizabeth and plaza and the other central to all things shopping and dining in South Park. Every time I go I try something different and I've had about everything on the menu. Today I had one of my all-time favorites the living bagel for breakfast with a warm golden milk (which is truly heaven sent). They sweeten the golden milk with dates and paired with Tumerick and spices it is truly amazing. We were there for a meeting and sat chatting so long that we also decided to have lunch so I got an appetizer, one of my favorites, the sushi sweet potato roll. If you're looking for healthy, nutritious options you can not go wrong at Lunas living kitchen. Smoothies, juices, snacks, meals, and appetizers in a clean and welcoming environment is all we need! We need more places like Lunas in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Sitting at the communal table eating their Caesar Salad topped with a veggie burger and I feel compelled to write this on the spot. This is by far the best Caesar Salad, Salad, and FOOD I've ever had! Highly highly recommend! I want to order one to go for dinner!"}
{"text":"Love it here. Luna's makes eating healthy fun -- everything tastes so good. I could literally eat here every day and be a size 2 if my wallet could afford it!  I love to stop by after a yoga class and grab a juice or smoothie. I've never eaten anything bad off the menu, either. Seriously, the only thing that keeps me from being here daily is the sticker shock every time I see the bill -- but I do understand the cost of not cutting corners and having fresh food all the time is not little. If you haven't been here, put it on your list of places to try."}
{"text":"Ok, very different and I enjoyed the experiencing and would alike to try it again. The table next to our had soup and I saw no soup on the menu so i think we might have missed that. I was wondering if all the food was cold as my managotti was a cold plate item. But I enjoys the whole thing. The only downside was the waitress, which I was not a fan of was service the table to our right and sneezed all over our table. She did say she got the floor but way phone was speckled with ..lets not go there.  I felt like it took the healthy out of  the experience. My daughter said she got the water to and refused to drink any more. But the food as tasty and healthy. would love to try a shot next time"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte! The only negative is that they're not open on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal tonight as is every visit to Living Kitchen. The soup which was sweet potato and pear was incredible. My wife had the tart and I the sliders. Fantastic flavors with terrific service. Thanks for being here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Now, I swear that I reviewed this place twice, once when it was the small cafe and again when the expansion occurred.  Apparently, my review has somehow been erased, so here I go again. Basically, what's not to love?  My all time favorite is the Lunasagna with its velvety texture and exquisite creaminess.  This time, I had the manicotti and found that pleasing as well.  Fresh tomato sauce and thin zucchini slices oozing with that lovely cashew cheese.  An arugula salad accompanied this dish, and it was fresh and crisp, delicately topped with a light, lemony dressing. I love that the expanded restaurant includes wine, and on this hot evening, I had a refreshing rose.  The carafes of water on the tables were also  a welcome touch. We had quite a large crowd seated on the patio, but this did not deter our excellent servers. So, Luna's remains one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  And, if I have to write ten more reviews of the place to prove it, I will."}
{"text":"Uh-mazing! and creative! Great flavors! I had the living burrito and then cookies and homemade almond milk for dessert. Everything is plant based-yum!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian or vegan but I figured I would try out Living Kitchen since I live nearby. I was very pleasantly surprised by the options on the menu and creativity! I ordered the lavender capp which was very rich, but tasty and beautiful. I also got the avocado basil sandwich which I finished before I could take a picture because it was that good! I bet it would also be great with the \"bacon\" added. I look forward to going back for a healthy meal again!"}
{"text":"The living burrito is one of my favorite kings on the menu! Very filling, I can spilt this into two meals."}
{"text":"Good, healthy food! I tried the sweet potato sushi, the pho and the broccoli Waldorf salad. The sushi was my favorite of the three. It was an interesting spin on the normal. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for a healthy alternative for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"If you aren't vegan/vegetarian, don't worry, the food is still awesome. I had the fire and brimstone burger and kale salad on the servers recommendation, and both were fantastic. Service was friendly, fast, and attentive. Highly recommend this spot in Charlotte for all omnivores, carnivores, and herbivores alike!"}
{"text":"My fresh lemonade was the perfect thing to quench my thirst from the Fire and brimstone burger with a side of cauliflower rice"}
{"text":"Went to Luna's several years ago with a coleauge, and it was a pleasant experience but couldn't give an accurate assessment do to the lack of sampling a good majority of the menu"}
{"text":"Luna's Living Kitchen is a gem, and I haven't been able to find similar restaurants in the other cities I have been to. Everything at Luna's is super fresh and delicious. I'm not a big vegan / salad fan, but I have consistently enjoyed all my meals at Luna's.  Some of my favourites are: (1) Mint to be smoothie, (2) Cacao granola, (3) Arugula salad, (4) Sweet potato sushi roll. They also have fresh pressed juices to-go. I love how they support local, organic farmers.  Definitely one of my go to places in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a while. Would give zero stars if I could. Stood at the bar area to order a smoothie and got ignored while all the non-ethnic customers got helped. And they weren't even busy. Guess south end isn't as progressive as I thought."}
{"text":"I loved the charm, atmosphere, spaciousness, and cleanliness of this place. Service (to go) was fast and very friendly. I got the falafel appetizer which was the perfect portion for me.  I selected it because it was raw instead of how other restaurants prepare which is fried (I don't like).  In fact everything here is raw and they obviously make it all homemade. The falafel in and of itself was good (don't judge a book by its cover) but I wasn't crazy about the seasoning of the dips or the pickling of the vegetables. I really thought the seasoning was a little overpowering (garlicky) when I am really used to eating more raw food without alteration. But this again could be a personal preference on my part. Everything else was great and I would like to go back to try some other things."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in charlotte..very creative dishes..awesome tasting food..fire and brimstone burger wrapped in collard leaf is a must try alongwith rawco taco salad..do not leave unless you have had their desert especially the dulce amor..."}
{"text":"Food was great and I'd provide a higher rating for just that if I could.   Service? It was terrible. Started off fine, but our server quickly became the last person we ever saw. Dishes were cleared sparingly. Dessert took forever. I had to go hunt down silverware to eat my dessert with, because none was provided once the six dishes were cleared. One staff member looked utterly confused when I asked for a spoon to eat cream brûlée with, and couldn't provide one. Imagine eating it with a fork.   Yes, I was here during restaurant week. No it wasn't slammed busy or crazy. So that's not an excuse. Just poor service."}
{"text":"I would become vegetarian for this place!  I've been twice and honestly have nothing but good things to say about Luna's.   To start with the food... The menu is so unique and fresh. Zucchini is used for a lot of the pasta substitutes. And makes it feel light and airy to eat!  You feel full without feeling yucky by the end of the meal. Definitely order some of the delicious appetizers. Hummus x3, even the bread with nut butter and fig jam is great. And prices are very reasonable for the quality I have to say.   The location is super trendy. There is even an Anthropoligie moving in next door. And at the back of the shopping center I find there is no troubles with parking availability.   Finally the decor and service. I found the inside very simply and cleanly decorated. The chairs outside on the patio were comfortable and clean. The service was good, we were well attended and plates cleared quickly. Jars of water were placed a the table for your own refills... So smart!   If you haven't been, even if you aren't sure since its #veggie, give it a try. It won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Such a different concept executed well! Very busy even at 230 on a Saturday, but worth the wait. I loves how they wrapped sandwiches in collard greens. The \"sushi\" was really nice with flavorful sauce and the hummus was excellent. Delicious chocolate cake!"}
{"text":"It is a new American style restaurant and the dishes look like very healthy. However, everything is overpriced. I felt like I need  another dinner 2 hours later."}
{"text":"I had a nice breakfast there. The almond milk latte was too sweet for my taste, but the Biblical breakfast was fantastic--very filling, with a nice mix of bread, nut butter, fruit etc. It's not cheap, but it's a place I'd go back to again. The service was friendly too."}
{"text":"Very good clean food. Service was slow, wait was long to get in. Turtle cake was the best. Avocado basil sandwich was good. Hummus was flavorful with the cranberry bread. Cesar salad was good too. Pho could have been better."}
{"text":"Lovely setup, nice, clean, and open. Very trendy. They have a wonderful mocha and caramel latte. I did not expect it to be only vegan, like no dairy or anything. We got a sandwich and \"ceaser\" salad. The faux ceaser dressing was pretty good, very garlic-y though. Decent kale croutons. The sandwich was tasty (it was multi grain bread with a sunflower seed spread and avocado and sprouts and stuff.) Definitely more expensive for there to be no meat or real cheese, but then again I am not a vegan and I suspect they would appreciate a dedicated restaurant like Luna's. Big portions which I did not expect. I'd go back just for coffee ;)"}
{"text":"This is such a cute restaurant. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The server was very knowledgeable and provided great recommendations. We opted for for the Mexican bowl, Pear pizza and the BBQ sliders. Everything was delicious. My husband loved everything! I can tell everything is prepared fresh and with care. The only reason I did not give this a five star is simply because the food took forever. Other than that I would recommend this place to any one."}
{"text":"We always love coming to Luna's! This is my wife's favorite place when we go out. I am always getting new people try Luna's and everyone always raves about it. When you ask someone who is not accustomed to raw vegan food you get some odd looks; once they taste it nothing but smiles! It so nice to feel good about what you are eating and drinking."}
{"text":"Nice vegan spot. I will say that the prices are a bit on the heavy side for it being vegan flare. The breakfast menu is a little short, but drinks and hot teas are amazing! I can't wait to go and try to their lunch and dinner menu, it seems way better than the breakfast..."}
{"text":"I love this spot! One of the best vegan spots in Charlotte. I always get the Golden Milk and Kale Caesar Salad. My cousins are in town and they wanted to try something new, so here we are!!"}
{"text":"This place is not good. Tiny portions, dry bread, overpriced, flavor of the food mediocre. I appreciate the effort, but they should put less into the ambience and more into making the food worth eating. -my vegan boyfriend."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with Living Kitchen. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan, and I've always been completely satisfied with the menu options and quality of food. My go-to is typically the Sprout it Out salad, but I just tried the new Arugula Harvest salad on the fall menu and fell in love. The salads at Living Kitchen are huge and they are well thought out--the flavor profiles stand out, plus it looks like every dish has been curated by an actual artist.   If you haven't been, go check it out! Grab a juice and enjoy the bright and airy atmosphere."}
{"text":"So this place definitely delivers on what they're selling. Great fresh squeezed juices, and vegan options abound. While I happen to prefer an Omnivorous lifestyle, this place is the model for vegan/vegetarian establishments. Approachable, reasonable, and friendly. While I may prefer some steak and potatoes, this place is on point for what they're selling."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the burrito and the caesar salad. It is expensive so I wouldn't be able to make this a regular place to eat although I wish I could. That's the only reason it gets 4 stars. Be careful to your nut allergy folks as there are many nut substitutes here."}
{"text":"One of our favorites! Awesome place to also meet up for breakfast or treat out of town guests to"}
{"text":"Vegan and vegetarian heaven! The food was super sexy, excellent, delicious, fast and fresh. The location was a little difficult to find per gps, Idk had me a Lil awkward. The set up was super cool"}
{"text":"The best part -- it's all raw so your food comes out fast! I ordered the Pad Thai. While I didn't really notice it tasting much like your standard Pad Thai, it was excellent. Light yet still filling. Have a variety of entrees, smoothies, juices and beverages. Small patio area in the back of the building. Parking can sometimes be tricky in that lot, but a few extra steps never hurt anyone."}
{"text":"Although I am not vegan, I love the food and the atmosphere at Luna's Living Kitchen.   I have gone here on dates, with groups and by myself. Every time it just feels right. The community table is a great way to get to know people if you are a transplant to Charlotte. Don't hesitate to strike up a conversation.  I have NEVER been disappointed by their food. It's filling but does not leave you feeling bloated or lethargic.   LLK has easily become one of my favorite Saturday hangouts. Afterward you can walk over to the market."}
{"text":"This place is so great!  I'm not a vegetarian but could be converted by Luna's! The sandwich I had was delicious and the service at the bar was attentive and informative. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"While I'm not a vegetarian I do tend to eat a lot less meat than most guys my age. And as a frequent business traveler I'm always on the lookout for a place that offers healthy eating options on the road. A friend recommended Luna's and I wasn't disappointed at all. Everything was extremely fresh and flavorful. I had the sweet potato sushi, a collard green \"burger\" with a side of beet salad. I'll definitely be dining there again when I'm back in town. PS...please feel free to open one in Charleston, SC!"}
{"text":"I'd give it 4 stars but I don't like the cuisine.  The toast is ok.  The smoothies are great.  That's all I order.  It's a bit pricey and the vegetables masquerading as pasta are not my cup of tea.  Last time I went there the server forgot to put in my smoothie order until reminded that it was missing.  The only reason I come back here is my regular dinner date is ceiiac and she likes the place.  The toast is the only glutenous item on the menu.  Parking is never a problem.  The view at sunset is unremarkable."}
{"text":"I knew I would love this place as soon as I stepped through the door. The interior here was beautifully designed, with lots of attention to detail really shining through. There are high tables, regular tables, wooden chairs, cozy couches, modern art, and lots of beautiful plants scattered throughout. Definitely a hip vibe.   The menu options are all plant based and organic. On my visit I got the Macrobiotic Bowl which included adzuki beans, quinoa, kale, roasted sweet potatoes, sauerkraut, and a lemon tahini dressing. Sooo good. I loved my bowl. I've only had adzuki beans (red beans) in a traditional Chinese style soup before so I was amazed at how tasty it was in this dish as well. I was also a fan of my friend's Curry Bowl, which had curried lentils, quinoa, kale, roasted cauliflower, pickled cabbage, tomatoes, and chimichurri sauce. Both filled us up!  I'm so glad I discovered this place, and know I'll be frequenting it a lot more so I can try all the other grain bowls and salads. Their lattes and desserts sound amazing as well. Highly recommend for anyone, even a non vegan/vegetarian like myself!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan. However, I do want to flag my review as a PICKUP review. It's expensive and difficult to order but had alright flavor.   In my case, I would not recommend this place if you're picking up lunch for a team. The ordering process was sooo painful. So we placed our order, then 5 minutes later they called back telling us they're out of the Pad Thai (comm between hosts and the kitchen would be good here). Then we replace our order with wraps and go to pick it up.   First off, they almost forgot to give me my lemonade. Then we take it to the office only to find that FORGOT AN ENTREE. I felt so bad for my colleague that ended up with the side salad for her missing entree. Additionally, my entree was just not there, they just gave us an extra order of another entree. Le sigh.   I will say that the flavors were pretty good for vegan food. I usually don't go for vegan/vegetarian food because of a lack of flavor but this had some nice flavor profiles. I had the Living Burrito and the Kale Green Lemonade. The lemonade was very tasty but over-priced.  I would NEVER order lunch from this place again but I am willing to come in for a dine-in experience. This price rating for this place definitely needs to be upgraded to $$$."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a Vegan Restaurant to try, so I went on Yelp and read the reviews and decided to try Luna's. The atmosphere was great and the employees were very friendly. We started out with the sweet potato sushi rolls, they were wonderful. My husband ordered the Lunasagna which was a little bland for his taste. I ordered the Tamatico Tart. The tart was very tasty and I thought I had found a good vegan restaurant...until I pulled out the longest dark HAIR from my meal! I immediately felt nauseous! The manager and waitress were very nice and offered to prepare me another tart, but after seeing the hair being pulled for my food...ummm, no thanks! I know this may be an isolated case, but it happened to me, and I will not be returning to Luna's Living Kitchen."}
{"text":"Ok, the food is REALLY Good!  I was so pleased!  Everything I tried was tasty!  I had the Sweet Potato /Pear Soup,  \"Sushi\", Mushroom Broccoli Pizza, Green Salad,  and the Lavender Cappuccino (I shared the Appetizer).  The \"Sushi\" was probably my least favorite, but the Sauce was delicious!  I will definitely go again and either get the same thing or try something else!"}
{"text":"I am completely in love with this place. The drinks are amazing and the salads are unforgettable. I crave this place all the time.. It's kind of sad lol  Can't beat it for vegetarian/vegan in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out, and..well, overall a great experience, I certainly appreciated their customer service, design, concept, and we've tried delicious dishes.. but this place is really overpriced. I understand it's all trendy and cool, but nearly $15 for a simple vegetable & \"superfood\" salad (taco salad to be exact). Yes, delicious, but the price doesn't do the justice."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food with a very comfortable and upscale atmosphere, the service was exceptional as well I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I have been researching the raw vegan lifestyle for the past year. I will soon try the lifestyle for a while which is why it was important for me to try Luna's. I had been craving raw vegan burritos after watching so many you tube videos and food bloggers making them. I enjoyed the \"living burrito\" with the salad as a side and the hot sauce was great! I loved the spice and trying to figure out how I can make it at home. The burrito was quite messy but that is expected as any food such as that is. My 7 year old daughter had the \"avocado basil sandwich\" in which I took a bite and it was tasty, she also enjoyed it. My boyfriend had the \"sprout it out salad\" and enjoyed it as well. What I loved the most was the \"caramel latte\" that I requested with coconut milk. Our waitress was a little slow bring things when asked which is my reason for the 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Live raw food is only as good as the produce itself and everything here felt fresh and of high quality. We had the \"tuna\" sandwich, BLT, Split Pea Soup, homemade coconut milk and Lemon berry \"cheesecake\".  The waitress/hostess was also especially nice and helpful in exploring the different menu options.   We had both sandwiches done with the collard green wraps and both sandwhich a were excellent. The BLT with the mushroom \"bacon\" was especially good. I do have a gripe though, there simply was enough filling in the sandwhich to be satisfying. While very tasty, you end up feeling a bit had (and hungry!). Also more filling would match the amount of collard green used as the exterior wrap.   The split pea soup with cashew cream was delicious. If nitpicking, some density or chunks of something were needed as it was a touch thin and watery but flavor was spot on and excellent.   The lemon berry cheesecake was the weak link. Certainly good enough but at $10 it was both too small and more of a tart palate cleanser than didn't deliciously decadent dessert. I'd suggest trying some of the others.   Lastly, the homemade coconut milk was excellent.  Creamy coconut flavor and just delicious.   4 stars only due to slightly skimpy portions for the prices asked. 5 star vegan food though. I WILL come back."}
