{"text":"If we could give zero stars, that's what this place deserves. Alright let's begin with the phone call. We called to order a pizza and fries, and we get transferred to the delivery line after being put on hold and forced to listen to some political debate (which is a questionable choice). Then we were put on the line with some man who was probably the snappiest, rudest person working that night (although the other person we dealt with wasn't that fantastic either). We tried to speak to make the order and the man kept interrupting us and asking questions we literally just answered. Then he asked the address with the disclaimer, \"You have to tell me, I don't have a crystal ball.\" After giving him the address, we tried to ask how long the delivery would take but he oh-so-kindly hung up the phone.  We assumed an hour would be the right amount of time, and then after an hour we still didn't have our pizza. We called them back to ask what happened, which is where the most infuriating thing happened. The lady said we were apparently outside the delivery area (a fact not told to us by the first rude server) and that they didn't call us to tell us because our number is not a 514 number.  So in sum, we had awful service by people who seemed to not think a whole lot about problem-solving to make good service and no pizza. Thanks Monkland Grill, we're hungry and grumpy now. You're great."}
{"text":"Cozy place. Stopped in for a quick bit to eat as we often see people on the terrace. We decided to share the two pita, fries and drink order. The waitress was kind enough to let us know that they charge a $3 \"sharing fee\". A bit ridiculous. They also do not use cheese curds in the poutine. It's just shredded mozzarella. Not impressed. Although the staff was friendly, the food wasn't amazing and don't really care to go back."}
{"text":"Ouf, le décor est affreux et tout semble sale et vieux. De vieux menus plastifiés, les toilettes au sous-sol, le café infecte et froid...brrr,  je n'y retournerai jamais."}
{"text":"I would give less than 1 star if I could ... I ordered food last night, came rather quickly to my suprize.  So other than the fries being bland and salt less and tasteless and the price being way to much for what I got , my pork in my Wana be gyro was friken raw and now to my great pleasure I have food poisoning. I will never go or order from them again ... I am the head chef of a restaurant myself BTW .. this is just negligent and lazy and dangerous wake up monkland grill."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend because we live in the neighbourhood and I only ordered the Poutine and her the BLT. À Poutine is only three ingredients and pretty hard to mess up in a serious way. As advertised in the pictures, its fries, gravy and cheese curds.  When I Poutine arrived the curds were non-existent and some sort of grated cheese was melting away into a liquid mush on what appeared to be gravy. On first bite the gravy tasted like water and had about the same consistency. It did have clumps throughout it and wasn't properly mixed and lacked any flavour. The fries themselves were undercooked and tasted freezer burned. Probably he single worst Poutine I've ever had in my life. My friends BLT didn't look much better. The bacon looked burnt on one side.  How does a place like stay open. They clearly do not give a hoot about the quality of the food they serve or even making the way it's advertised. Never will I ever eat at this place again even if I was paid to do so. Excruciating"}

{"text":"Back when I tried it for take out about a year ago, they weren't even on Yelp period. Interestingly they are now and have three 1 star reviews, which with all the math I know still turns out to be a 1 star average.   Yikes x 2. That's pretty rough. I mean I get that the counter person was not the \"mostest\" of friendliness, but jeez. Without reading the other reviews yet, I'll just say my few words about what I tried.   In a pita shell, I walked up to the counter for my measly late afternoon snack. Simply a take-out chicken Souvlaki pita, which was not the grandest of orders, but with the BBQ place across the street closed until dinner, it meant a lot to me.  I have to say, it was one of the best straight up chicken Soulvaki pitas I've had in a city of many Greek restaurants.   I'm talking fresh, warm, big chunks of meat, thick cut (almost too much so red tomato), an above average Tzatziki sauce, and onions which I do not recall repeating on me. It was also well wrapped which helped as I ate it on a set of steps nearby.  In sum below average friendliness, plus well above average taste and decent value for $5 plus taxes. That kind of gives an around about 3 star average. Surely more than 1. Now I've got to read the other reviews to see what I may have missed. Such suspense. Can't wait."}
{"text":"Monkland Grill is a wonderful little place offering quality a few notches above fast food. You can get a wide variety of dishes here such as brochettes, fish and chips, pizza, poutines and pasta. The quality is decent yet some dishes are better than others. This is my go to place for ordering above average pizza on a budget. The pizza and fries will be about $20.00, not as expensive as B&M(not as good either) but not as cheap as Double Pizza (but tastes much better). The place is huge too and you'll often see it packed with group gatherings due to the large seating area. Delivery is fast and free and walking in to pick it up is also speedy."}
{"text":"continually disappointed.    Low prices but poor quality.  I do go here because we have meetings and I order the Salmon, which is decent.    Definitely Avoid the Lamb Chops. You will be disappointed."}
