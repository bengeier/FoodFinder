{"text":"This has to be the worst place I have ever been to. Bad service, bad food, worst drink. 

Wait time : 0 of 5 stars.

We waited 30 mins for our food. Food came first then they took another 30 mins for mine drink to come then another 15 mins for my sister's. In total we wasted over an hour for 2 drinks. Ok understand they are busy but it is ridiculous that they took that long for 2 drinks.

Service: 0 out of 5 stars

10 mins after our food came without drink, I asked for water. No water came. No one came to check if the food was ok. Server at the till was rude when I asked for a plastic bag for our to go food. I ordered a red bean slush, they gave me a milk tea.

Food and drink: 0 out of 5 stars

Here is why. Korean rice cake was nothing but spicy. Chicken wings were soak in oil and doesn't even have good flavour for the sauce. Mine drink was wrong but I try it anyway because they already took too long to make it and I was thirsty; it was loaded with sugar, way way way too sweet. My sister got a jasmine green tea, absolutely disgusting, no sugar and we can see the tea bag they left in it, it tasted like it was expired."}
{"text":"After hearing about the shaved ice trend, we decided to look for other restaurants in Calgary that may have the same and came across this place on 16th Ave.  To be honest, the reviews made me a bit leary, but I think this is not a bad place and exceeded my expectations!

Atmosphere: 3.5/5  The outside may be a bit sketchy, but I was pleasantly surprised by the bright and large interior.  Quite relaxed and quiet atmosphere with a few tables being occupied - would be a good place for a meeting.  I was also surprised to find that parking was not difficult at all even though it is located on busy 16ave - this may be because of the time of day.  Overall clean.

Food: 4/5  I had the yakisoba with chicken, bacon, ham, cabbage onion and carrot and we shared an order of lemon pepper wings.  My dish was huge and tasty - sauce may be a bit on the heavier side but since I was hungry, I was ok with it.  Wings were delicious also and I liked that all the items were made to order and came piping hot.  Unfortunately, the shaved ice machine was down so we did not end up trying it.

Service: 3/5  Adequate and overall friendly but a little slower at taking our order, esp since there were not that many occupied tables

Price: 3/5  Reasonable

Overall: 3/5  Overall not as bad as reviews suggest - I was pleasantly surprised by the bright relaxed atmosphere and tasty food.  We came out really full as the food was a bit heavy, and I was kind of disappointed at not having tried the shaved ice, but I would definitely give this restaurant another chance... esp their other specials!"}
{"text":"COMPLETELY OVER PRICED, I personally went with 10 people who were friends with the owner, for the 10 of us is costed about 390 CAD including tax and tip. The food was meh. which was definitely not worth 40 bucks a person, the egg waffle/ bubble waffle they offered was soggy and wasn't what I expected. One person ordered a smoothie and the waiter aka the owner asked if she wanted it cold or hot, like who would have the thought of putting a smoothie in the microwave, the service was slow and the service for hot drinks was very inconsistent where one person's tea would come first then 20 minutes later the other cup of tea would be served, the calamari was i feel not golden brown and was under-fried, with addition I felt that attention to customers needs were not met as I had an empty cup sitting at the edge of the table which clearly signifies ( at least from a person with common sense) that I need a refill, in the end, i had to ask for a glass of water. The menu was in English, which was very confusing as it serves Asian/ Taiwanese food. I feel that there are better places to get similar things to eat for a better price and better food quality in the city."}
{"text":"It kinda feels like bubblemania but less crowded and less noisy. I like it :) I love their bubble waffle... I think it's great but there's room for improvement. :)"}
{"text":"Relaxed atmosphere, lots of seating, got seated right away. Friendly staff greeted at the entrance. Place is clean and has lots of window, so natural light. I tried the Japanese BBQ pork rice, big portions. More that I could eat at one sitting. It was really delicious . Premium milk tea, really fresh. I would definitely recommend this \"gem\"."}
{"text":"Can I give zero stars? We walked in, made eye contact with the male server who in turn did not smile or greet us in any way. The female server wouldn't even look at us. We waited at the front counter to be greeted but the entire time the female was behind the counter she didn't acknowledge us at all. We waited a total of 10 minutes before we decided to leave since no one said so much as a \"Hi\". It wasn't busy, there was 4 tables and most of them already had drinks. I can't even say it was poor service since it was essentially non-existent. 

We also browsed the menu since we had all that time. The menu was small, one side for drinks (poor selection as well) and one side for food. In comparison with Bubblemania, who I assume they're trying to compete with, down the street, I really don't see this place as competition. It doesn't come close to Bubblemania's level."}
{"text":"Lots of food and drink choices. Tables r nice to play board games. Service is awesome. Food is great but the drinks don't taste very good though."}
{"text":"Very slow service eventhough i see about 5 to 6  employees working. It's the middle of the week and there are currently 5 open tables (including ours) and they are overly slow. We ordered 4 bbteas. Waited for for a good 20 mins before we got the first 2 and waited for another 15 mins for the last 2 drinks. I don't even know if they have a system on how long each drink and food should take to make.. the location and atmosphere is good. I just hope that they train their front of the house properly and organize the orders a bit."}
