{"text":"Not the place to go for a nice dinner. Cocktails were pretty good ( st Germain recommended, the pineapple one not so much). The food was not the best. One vegetable dish we ordered was delicious, the fries were underwhelming, and the meat was overpriced and not that good. I'd recommend this place for drinks but not food. Also bf and I were having stomach problems the next day, dunno if related ..."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner during the week. The service was a bit slow; however, the friendly server more than made up for it. I had the tartare and my husband had the short rib and bread (as an appetizer). I am not a bread person, but this was amazing. It was a denser brown bread that was chewy but tender at the same time. The tartare was full of flavor and light while still filling. Great food and service. Because it was a week night it wasn't busy, but the atmosphere was modernesque and chill."}
{"text":"East Thirty-Six is a great place. Late night drinks and great custom cocktails set this place apart. Well done."}
{"text":"After seeing the good reviews of this establishment, I decided to head here for some post-dinner cocktails with my partner. 

My partner ordered the Apothecary ($13--hayman's london dry, hayman's sloe gin, house tonic syrup, rosemary 
tincture, lemon juice, perrier), while I ordered the Coco Lochness ($15--coconut infused auchentoshan single malt scotch, house spiced rum,black cardamom bitters, grapefruit and lime juice, syrup, egg whites).

Both drinks sound different from each other, yet they tasted virtually identical.
And by that I mean they both tasted INCREDIBLY bitter and what I imagine cleaning products (i.e. Windex) would taste like. Note that I'm *not* being overly dramatic with my description of the flavour. 

I felt embarrassed because my partner wanted to take me out for fancy drinks as a treat, and I didn't want to tell him that I was absolutely repulsed by what he bought for me. But once I found out that his drink also tasted like toxic cleaning agents, I realised that we should probably mention something to the waitress. When she hovered near our table, I mentioned how the drink was awfully bitter--but instead of saying anything to us she just walked away. 

This happened several weeks ago, but I'm still really disappointed by this experience. And even if I tried, I don't think I'd be able to create such foul tasting beverages as the ones that were served to us here."}
{"text":"I arrived with a large, and frankly rowdy party to this restaurant and they treated us very well. Probably better than we deserved. To that end that customer service was very accommodating. 

However I did not like the food, and I felt ill for most of the evening afterwords and the following morning. Kudos to the front of house, not so much to the back of house."}
{"text":"Overpriced and overcooked.

Wanted something special for a date night and decided to go to East Thirty Six. Granted it was a Wednesday but the place was dead, absolutely no atmosphere.There were us two and a table of 4 women drinking cocktails only and it was 9pm. Our waiter was lovely but a little too annoying as I think he only had us to look after. Food was so mediocre. Honestly I could have paid half the price and still wouldn't have been satisfied. We shared the chicken liver pate and bone marrow to start, it was nice, tasty and a good start but small for a 'sharing portion'. I got the 'Special of the Day' which was hake on a bed of seaweed which I was so looking forward to yet the fish was in fact over done and chewy, really disappointing. My significant other ordered the lamb burger which was enjoyable but about half the size of a normal burger. We got a side of fries with the chicken skin, the latter of which I really enjoyed but the fries were terrible, so salty and tasteless. We finished by sharing the apple dessert which was dry and definitely not worth eating, in fact I don't even think we did eat it. Overall I was unhappy with the food, the restaurant itself was ok, I most certainly wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & fantastic service, dropped in on a Friday night with my fiance and really had a great time."}
{"text":"Had a great night here for drinks at the bar.  Staff is very friendly and attentive.  Looking forward to returning.  I have not tried their food."}
{"text":"In town for one night and this was a great choice. Super accommodating with the food allergies in our group, tasty cocktails and a solid wine list. All our dishes were delicious, including the lamb burger, radishes, fries, olives, salmon & tuna. 

The atmosphere was relaxed, and the staff were professional and welcoming. Bonus points for the impromptu coconut-infused whiskey shot at the end of the night :-) Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Uhhhmazing. I came in for an early dinner at around 4:30pm, and no other diners have arrived. The place had a sleek vintage bar/pub type of vibe, and the music was pretty mainstream. I was half-dreading a menu of buffalo wings and quarter-pounders when the hostess gave me the menu, and I was rebuked for my shallow judgment.

First came the radishes with bonito butter, chives, bonito flakes, and a light drizzle of extra virgin ($4). Again, my expectations were torn apart by how well it turned out. I particularly appreciated the chef's deliberateness in variegating the cuts for the radish, which not only made the simple dish look an absolute stunner, but also made eating it super interesting due to the various textures.

5pm is when the kitchen starts its operations, and by 5:10 my main was on the table. The Berkshire pork belly with broccoli, walnuts, gnocchi, fried egg, and ricotta salata was exactly what it was described to be, and in all seriousness, absolutely mind blowing. As soon as I cut into the gloriously oozy egg and the thick melting fat of the pork belly, the broccoli was able to mop it all up and become saturated with the yolk's creaminess and the pork fat's sweet, meaty flavor. The gnocchi was pillowy soft and had a crisp golden exterior. The pork belly (2 thick slices of it) had the crispiest skin and the perfect degree of tenderness. The egg was on point as well. Then, on top of all that, they made it snow with the ricotta salata.

Haven't had a dish where every component was treated with such care in a while. It's a pleasure to be reminded that such places exist. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Myself and a friend got drinks here last Saturday while catching up, and we were not disappointed.

Walking in, I ordered a boulevardier, and later I tried the \"Golden Era\". Both have bourbon in them, and both were spectacular. The bartender was very nice too. We would have stayed later and tried more drinks, but unfortunately the place was booked for a wedding reception around 8:30, which just goes to show how in demand it is. We will definitely be drinking here again - and maybe we'll even order food."}
{"text":"A great bar that's not a restaurant. They over serve the regulars making incredible an uncomfortable experience. 10min to get wine 30-40 to get food."}
{"text":"Great bar and great food/drinks. The bartender was awesome. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and helpful while we tried to figure out what to order. We were able to try bone marrow for the first time ever. Perfectly prepared and seasoned and happy we ordered it. Clean bathrooms. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner on a Monday night alone in town for work. Enjoyed two delicious cocktails from the extensive menu. The burrata with beets and cauliflower with hazelnuts were delicious. Friendly but unobtrusive service. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went to East Thirty-Six in April with my parents for lunch. It was raining, so there wasn't a lot of people there. However, the decor is very nice and I feel like it would be a great place for the after-work drinks.
The food was okay, I don't really remember what I ordered, but I kept on thinking that I would have a much better experience if I just went there for drinks."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this restaurant and it was an amazing experience.

We went on a Monday evening, so there wasn't a lot of people, but they do have 'buck a shuck' oysters from 4-7pm that day so it was a huge plus for us.

The service was great, very attentive and the pacing of each dish was spot on. We had the bone marrow which was the star of the night, beef carpaccio, chicken skin fries, and smoked sweet breads. Honestly the food was so good but everything we got were plates to share which was great cause everyone got to try everything.We also got cocktails which were so good that we kept getting more and more.

Would go here again! great service and amazing food."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this small place after a long flight from the states. First of all they play 90 hip hop for the win!

Ordered fries to be later told that they ran out. Server freaked out as this seems to be a very popular dish at the restaurant. Short rib entree was great and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"4/5! great places for after work drinks and tapas. I recommend the octopus and buratta. Personally, I was not a fan of the cauliflower. If you are a large group, I recommend making reservations in advance."}
{"text":"I come here every night after work and I'm treated like family everytime,  food is amazing, drinks are amazing,  music is amazing, I wish there were more stars so I can give East Thirty Six a 10/10. Food wise I would recommend the wild salmon tartare, drink wise definitely the Pina Caliente. Sebastian, Stanley, and Julian are a pleasure to have on the wellington strip!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. Had the lamb burger and it was tasty but I wasn't fussy on the ambience. The cosmo I ordered was very good."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. 
Tried this place as a solo tourist,  having searched Yelp for tapas to accommodate a ketogenic diet. 
The bartender and server were incredibly friendly and accommodating, offering suggestions and checking with the chef about ingredients. 
I was able to order off the dinner menu at 9pm.
Tried the pickled oysters with fennel -  a recommended special -  quite good. 
Also a tender sous vide cauliflower,  warm olives (so much better warm!!),  and the tuna crudo,  which was perfect raw fish with a shocking but refreshing amount of lemon juice and shaved celery. 
It was a pleasant experience,  urban atmosphere,  creative craft cocktails."}
{"text":"Good drinks, delicious cauliflower dish, ok but super expensive rib eye. Beautiful decor, good bartender."}
{"text":"This was suggested by my hotel concierge as a spot that was open late for a drink. It was described to me by what she said and what I looked up as a cool 1920's vibe bar with many liquor infusions. 

What I found was an extremely loud club like setting with few people (on a Saturday night) desperately trying to have conversations over the music. The environment was appropriate for a dance club, but the clientele and space did not seem to mesh with this. The drinks were pretty, but also pretty weak, and not cheap ($12-$14). Our server was very friendly, but service was very close especially considering how few patrons there were. I would not return."}
{"text":"Friends and I visited East Thirty-Six for Winterlicious last night - and were glad we did! From the very beginning, we were politely escorted to our reserved table. Our server arrived promptly and kindly explained a few details about the Winterlicious menu. We ordered a bottle of their house wine ($38) and proceeded with our selections. I had the Chicken Liver and Fois Gras Parfait to start - it was absolutely delicious! The pate was creamy and rich, and paired well with the marrow buttered croustini that came with it. My one friend commented that it was the best fois gras she had ever tasted. My second course was the 72-hour Shortrib. This dish had no faults - it was a wonderful combination of flavours with the rich, slightly smokey meat, the creamy semolina, and a bit of heat from the horseradish. To me, it was perfection on a plate. The main course was served to us by Julien, one of the co-owners of the restaurant, who made us feel incredibly welcome. It was a very personal touch that made us feel like regulars - though we were first time visitors. Dessert for me was lemon curd with candied macadamia nuts and shortbread, a great combination of tart, nutty and sweet that was a delicious ending to the meal. Before leaving, we were offered four 'digestif' shots on the house - what better way to top off the meal? Overall, wonderful food, spectacular service, and a welcoming ambiance. The perfect spot for a night out with friends or a significant other in TO."}
{"text":"This menu is over-priced & features small portions. The mains are tasty, but small and costly. The drinks are well-crafted, but are also expensive. Overall a fun experience, but be prepared to drop $100-$150 for two people.

This location has changed hands & names recently, yet I can't help but recall going there when it was called Lucien and paying $18 for three (half) scallops. I left East Thirty-Six feeling the exact same sense of bank account drain -- perhaps most evident by the fact that even the pre-meal bread cost $4."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and drink selection... Smaller than expected inside; more suited to grabbing a cocktail and a few tapas than a true dinner (especially if you're hungry)."}
{"text":"Restaurant & Service: The restaurant has a dark ambiance, but warmed with tea lights at each table. The leather upholstered chairs were paired with monograph glass top tables, with aluminum pendant lamps hanging above the long granite/marble bar table. The restaurant definitely had an old Hollywood feel to it. The service was great, our water glasses were never empty. Our waitress openly admitted to not knowing a lot about alcohol when asked about the cocktails, but was sweet in getting answers in a timely manner. We went to celebrate our friends birthday, and this environment was perfect! Online reservations were also helpful, and always a plus! 

Drinks: Easy Thirty Six has a long list of white and red wine, and even have a couple sparkling wine options (glass and bottle). There was a long list of cocktails ($12-14 each), which all sounded absolutely delicious! I had the French Connection, and fair warning: if you don't like coriander, this is NOT your drink. It's very distinct in its taste and smell, but sweet, and beautifully presented.

Food: The menu starts with small appetizer dishes, and as you go down the list, the dishes get a bit more dense, serving as mains. The dishes are meant to be small, but are not as small as tapas plates. Can be shared, or not, completely up to you!
Fries with salted chicken skin - totally hit the spot, especially with the lemon aioli, with the chicken skin twist. 
Cauliflower -  Definitely a favorite. Each bite was french, well balanced, and enjoyable. 
House Made Bread with Whey Butter - Nothing extraordinary, soft, but tasted a bit burnt. The butter was light and and fluffy though. 
Scallop Crudo -  Absolutely divine! It was a light and refreshing dish, with perfect balance of ingredients! HIGHLY recommend! 
Buratta - My friends said it was delicious, and was a great vegetarian option. 
Chocolate Delice - 80% cocoa chocolate something, with the consistency of a chocolate tart (somewhere between mousse and cake was how the waitress described it). If you like dark chocolate, caramel, and peanut brittle, you would love this dessert! 
Lemon Custard - Fluffy, not too sweet, but not too bitter. Light way to end off your dinnner.

Overall, it was a great experience. I will definitely be coming back for drinks/wine, and look forward to trying some of the mains, including the arctic char and short ribs that previous reviewers have raved about!"}
{"text":"Great vibe with a DJ playing music. The drinks were amazing and we also got a couple of small dishes which were very tasty. The service was also very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I have had lunch and dinner at East 36 or just popped in for a cocktail or three a few times and have always had a good experience, so I took my family for dinner when they visited from the UK. We were 7 adults and a (rather upset) baby. We were all thoroughly impressed with the food and service. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, without being overbearing, and was very helpful to my mum who doesn't drink alcohol but wanted something a bit 'exciting' to drink. The food was amazing and did not take long to get to the table, despite the restaurant being busy. None of us had a bad thing to say about our meals. My mum still talks about the tuna! After hearing that my family was visiting, one of the managers even came by to check that we were all happy and asked if he could do anything for us. We were not once given a bad look or comment from any of the staff about the baby, and they were very helpful in providing a high chair and juice (although we did take turns taking him outside so he wasn't a nuisance to other patrons).
We all had a wonderful time and I will definitely be back soon. Very impressed."}
{"text":"They have some really great shareable plates and possibly one my favorite places to now get fries downtown.

Food (4/5): Came here with a friend lured by their $1 oyster deal and East Thirty-Six did not disappoint. We ordered their fries with chicken skin, lamb burger, kimchi fries, then burrata. Now I've got to highlight their fries. I'm not sure what they do to them but its thick cut, soft in texture and flavorful as hell. How? I dunno, but along with the lemon aoili we ate it so fast that we had to try their kimchi fries. A side note on the chicken skin - not sure what it adds to the dish, but it made it interesting. Over to the kimchi fries. They do a great job. Kimchi flavor on par, not too saucy and a good balance of Korean flavors. Love love love. Lamb burger: soft patty, nice green sauce and great soft bun that altogether was an incredible mix of earthy flavors. It's quite a different meal and take on a burger in general, but bite after bite it grows on you and you are left wondering why you decided to share the burger. Burrata: okayy so it's burrata (sack of soft mozzarella cheese) paired with grilled buttercup squash, pureed eggplant and pangritata (crispy breadcrumbs aka poor man's Parmesan). While the mozzarella tasted like mozzarella, everything else was intensely flavored... and not in a good way. It felt like everything was screaming for attention in your mouth - eggplant was way too smokey, the pangritata was far too salty and the something freaky was happening with the squash. Mozzarella being mute on flavor was pretty much the star of this dish. I wouldn't order the Burrata again, however I would come back to try more of their shareable plates :)

Price (3/5): My friend and i ordered 18 buck a shuck oysters, chicken fries, kimchi fries, lamb burger and then the burrata. Safe to say we were hella full and had to take home the kimchi fries. For 4 dishes it came up approx $60... so $30ish for each of us. It's a slightly pricey adventure, but I'm satisfied paying that much.

Service (4.5/5): great! They are attentive, won't hesitate to answer questions and my water was always filled :) When the restaurant got busier it was alittle hard to grab their attention considering there were only 2 of them to take orders, serve food, and make drinks... heh. 

Ambiance (4.5/5): The place itself is small, but its very well furnished imo. The bar look classy and the although its a dark colored restaurant it's got an elevated flair to it. Safe to say, I'd bring someone here on a date :)

All in all, great experience, great food, would come back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but the food let me down. I ordered short ribs and they weren't. At least not like any short ribs I've ever had before. More like slices beef smothered in matchstick potatoes. Maybe other menu items are better but this choice really let me down."}
{"text":"This bar is perfect for a hot date.The bas has a speakeasy feel to it and there are a couple of booths where you can cozy up to your bae.
Their cocktail and wine menu are quite extensive.
The staff is friendly and willing to come up with recommendations according to your taste.
Their anniversary is coming up soon! Great excuse to go back to try their food menu."}
{"text":"Legit cocktails. End of story for me for this visit. I popped in with a good friend of mine to grab a drink and unwind.  I had actually spotted this place one day driving across Wellington to my office and it looked like a place I wanted to check out....so I did.  

I was kind of brain dead so I decided that I wanted to see a menu rather than trying to come up with something through conversation with the bartender. We both ordered a really simple cocktail - the French Connection.  With Hendricks as a base I knew it was going to be good and it was.  While we just kept it to a couple of drinks over some conversation, I did have a chance to check out the menu and was intrigued so I knew I would come back for food.

I think what I really liked about this place, and it was enough to get me to 5 stars, was the theme and ambiance - in a location where in my opinion, something like this is lacking. I will definitely be bringing more friends to this spot."}
{"text":"My wife & I live a few blocks from East 36th. We had gone a few times when they opened and were very impressed, but with all the great restaurants downtown TO hadn't been in over a year.  I now remember why we were so impressed when it opened. For a small place with a 'tasting menu' the dishes are very creative, well presented and great flavors!  We had the cauliflower, burrata, octopus, salmon and short rib; all were good.  

I certainly won't wait another year before going back!"}
{"text":"An interesting location with a unique twist. It was an unplanned visit as we had planned to go Italian but it was closed. On first glance the menu is very short and not too inviting, that said we took a leap of faith and ordered 4 dishes. It's probably best to describe it as Canadian Tapas. The food was very well presented and very filling. The deserts are rich and yet wholesome. 

Only down sides i think it is on the expensive side for what they offer and staff could be a little more interactive and try to connect with the customer.

Worth a visit"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The ambience and location are great. The owner is very friendly. The bartender gave us a lot of helpful suggestions. I really enjoyed my meal. The lemon custard is a must!"}
{"text":"They know how to celebrate a special occasion :)

Had dinner here with 4 friends to celebrate 2 birthdays.  I made a reservation through Open Table and noted that we had a special occasion.  Wow!  We received 2 rounds of shooters for the table on the house, along with dessert!  We really didn't expect such great treatment.

We ordered almost all of the apps and shared.  The bone marrow, cauliflower and sweetbreads were my fave. I thought they were good sized portions for sharing, unlike other restaurants were you literally get 1 bite.  We also shared the short rib which wS tender and full of flavour.

Cocktails were awesome and I really enjoyed the strawberry caipirinha.

There was a huge rush at one point in the evening and even though the staff were super busy, they didn't look at all stressed out and still remembered to check in on us.

Overall, East Thirty-Six was a pleasant surprise.  Good food and service with decent prices to match the quality of food.  My only qualm would be the volume of the music (fun sort of remixed 20's music) which made it a bit difficult to hear one another across the table over dinner.  Though that would not stop me from returning in the future if in the neighbourhood and craving a cocktail, or again for a celebratory dinner."}
{"text":"I recently have hosted a birthday party here in a group of 15. I was out of town so I had to book my party thru emails. Devon from the restaurant was quick to reply with all the inquiries I had which I liked that part. However, the actual dining experience was nothing special.

With such a big group, I appreciate East Thirty Six actually gave us a choice of one bill or split bills. The server of ours did not initiate any conversations with us nor menu advice. He gave us a feeling that as he was going to earn the 18% gratitude no matter what, he was not even trying to impress. All in all, they were doing their basic job of taking orders, delivering food and collecting money. Also, as our group did not have a cake arranged, we asked if they could give a slice of cake as a gesture. Plain cold NO was the answer.

With such a service, it actually dragged down the overall experience.

Food:
Pork belly was good
Sword fish was way too sour
Kimchi fries lack of sauce, could have been more generous

Will not come back nor recommend. Drinks are fine but I mean, don't alcohol taste the same anywhere with such a service?"}
{"text":"It was a really good tapas place. I think it would be really difficult to eat enough food if you just got a plate for yourself. The food was all really good.

We had pork belly, short rib, a cheese dish, lamb burger, and French fries with chicken skin. The pork belly was really tender. It had an egg on top that complimented the bread pieces and pork belly really well. The short rib was a perfect medium rare. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were really flavorful. The lamb burger had a lot of different flavors in it that went well together. The cheese dish was kinda funky. My friends enjoyed it a lot though. The fries and chicken made me laugh. It was under the vegetables section and we had to confirm with the server that salted chicken wasn't a misnomer and actually is what it said. It was good. They didn't relent on the salt. I topped it all off with a pretty well made dark and stormy.

Everything was good. I would only recommend it if your group is willing to spend some money. Things were pretty pricey here for not much food but you get what you pay for and the food is good."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious meal! One of my favorite winterlicious spots yet! Check my pics for the dishes I chose. I usually like to pick things I wouldn't normally get- foie gras,  main dish with truffle sauce, chocolate delice. ..these caught my attention I was nowhere near disappointed!  Yummmmy!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! They have a lot of unique dishes that are fun to try! My friend and I got the bread loaf ($4), the squid ($10), and the lamb burger ($16) along with a beer and gin and tonic for happy hour. The bread was very good and I would recommend getting it to start off. The squid was similar to calamari and had a spicy sauce that went very well with it. I'm not much of a fish person so I didn't eat too much of it but it was still very tasty and if you're a fish person I'm sure you would enjoy it more. The lamb burger was my favorite though! It had a really good cilantro-type mayo on it as well as lettuce and fried onions.

This all was a good amount to split and have a meal for two! I would definitely recommend going here for happy hour because the drink prices were very reasonable compared to the other places in the area for happy hour."}
{"text":"A great spot for after work drinks and snacks! They serve up one of my favourite bone marrow dishes with a decadent liver pate. Happy hour drinks for $5 from 4-7pm."}
{"text":"Good wine selection and really great salad and cauliflower dish. The atmosphere is nice, more of an intimate setting and there is bar seating too which is a nice place to sit."}
{"text":"The cocktails are among the best I've ever had.  And the fine dining food was mouth-watering.  Definitely try the octopus and the lamb burgers.  Service was also top-notch.  Great ambiance."}
{"text":"Worst bar ever.
The place is very pretentious and obviously expensive for what you have.
The waiters are unfriendly.
You can have 10 times better anywhere around.
TO BE AVOIDED."}
{"text":"My wife and I popped into East Thirty Six for dinner on a late December evening, staying at a nearby hotel.  We picked based on Yelp, thanks reviewers!

Everything we tried was spot on, from the fancy cocktails to the dessert.  We tried mixed pickles, fries, bread and butter and the brown butter cauliflower.  All of these starters were terrific, but the cauliflower (yes cauliflower -as the other reviews have pointed out) was the standout.   

I had octopus, my wife had short ribs, both of which were also lovely.  

For dessert we shared an apple ricotta cake that was just perfect for a lightly sweet touch.   

A great choice for a simple, delicious evening out."}
{"text":"Had the cauliflower app (incredible) and the rib entree (OMG!!!!!). And, as if it wasn't perfect enough...they have a fannntastic IPA on tap. I'll be back!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  It has a New York feel and the menu and drinks are amazing!  Came In last week for lunch on a Friday, was a little slow but had the chicken liver parfait, buratta, chicken skin fried chips, octopus and pickerel.  Everything was great! Seasoned properly, reasonable prices, clean and friendly staff, I love it here.

Happy Eating Toronto."}
{"text":"It's my Toronto secret tip for all my out of town visitors and one of my fav afterwork drink spot. I kinda want to keep it a secret but the team deserves the praise. Bartenders are top notch (hi Eliza and Julien!)  Fav drink is The St-Germain which is too die for and I love the kimchi fries and oyster happy hour. It has a great welcoming atmosphere and everyone is super friendly."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I came to Thirty Six East!! 

Their Winterlicious lunch was absolutely worth it. The restaurant has a cool vibe to it. I came here with a group of 10 on a Wednesday, and there were barley any other patrons at the restaurant.  

The service was lightning fast. Our meals came right after the other. 

I ordered the butternut squash soup and it was delicious!! I am a butternut squash LOVER and the soup just enhanced the ingredient times 100. I especially loved the sage leaf on top and all the nuts. However, someone in my group ordered the mussels for the appetizer and she thought they were nothing special. 

For the main, I ordered the pan seared trout and it tasted really good. I was actually so happy and surprised the skin on my trout was CRISPY!!! I almost always order fish when I go to restaurants and the skin is never crispy. NEVER EVER. HALLELUJAH SOMEONE KNOWS HOW TO COOK FISH. AT A RESTAURANT! I also tasted some of the orzo from someone else in my group and I actually thought that was way more delicious than my trout. I'd come back to East Thirty Six to order that next time, whenever there is a next time. 

The dessert was an ultra rich fudge thing that I could not finish, but it tasted amazing!! Great for chocolate lovers. 

TLDR; GREAT FIND! Small restaurant punched with flavours. Food was appetizing and filled me up and their service was amazing. Their winterlicious menu was worth it for me. I would come back for their regular menu."}
{"text":"Very nice addition to downtown. This bar/ restaurant has a very chique anterior and funky decor. Limited menu choices but bar peanuts have amazing flavour and owner is very friendly"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late night drink with a friend. It has a very intimate ambience and classic look which would make it the perfect place for a date. We grabbed a spot at the bar since we weren't eating. They had a list of cocktails that were $8 because it was after 9pm. Not knowing what to get I asked the server for suggestions and he was very helpful in explaining some of the drinks and suggesting ones he thought I would like based on my preferences. I settled on the St-Germain drink which is gin based with a citrusy, tropical flavour. It was perfect! I expected to be there for one drink and ending up staying for two. It would have been three had I not had work the next day! 
If you're in the esplanade area and you need a break from all the pubs, you should give this place a try. Next time I'm stopping by for the food!"}
{"text":"4.5
An excellent place for dinner and drinks. The mains do run a little on the expensive side, but if you arrive from 4-6 for their drink specials, it definitely keeps the experience a little more cost effective. On certain days they also do buck a shuck if you like oysters. I visited with my  parents and their friends who were visiting from the UK and we all agreed that East Thirty Six was a fabulous spot.

I had read that the portions were small, but three in our group had the pork belly with gnocchi, walnut, broccoli and ricotta salata. The pork belly, of course, was very rich, but the balance of the walnuts, fresh crunchy broccoli and salty cheese made for a very well thought out and varied dish that was not a skimpy portion. I had the Short rib on polenta. The meat was very tender and well seasoned and the polenta was soft, rich and satisfying.

My father ordered the bone marrow with chicken liver pate and it was out of this world! Probably my favourite dish of the evening. The portion of bone marrow was generous and easy to remove while the silky consistency of the chicken liver pate made every thing about this dish melt in your mouth. IMO, this is an entree in Toronto not ot be missed. Understand that you will need a side of some sort of vegetable with this. We did not try the cauliflower, but this would have been my pick.

Fries with chicken skin and lemon aioli were a bit confusing. I love fries. I love chicken skin. But I'm not sure what they are doing together. Don't misunderstand me; any excuse eat chicken skin is perfectly acceptable, but perhaps the skins could have been served separately and a bit more crispy. Fries and aioli were excellent: fluffy inside and crispy outside. The aioli was bursting with flavour.

Service was excellent. One of the members of our group was gluten free and our server was great about consulting with the kitchen as to the dishes that could be modified suit her intolerance.

I would definitely return to East Thirty Six. I prefer smaller places that can get more creative with their menus to the larger chain restaurants in the downtown core. I considered going to Biff's, because we needed a location near Union Station, but I think that East Thirty Six was a bit more unique and a better option for out of town guests.

Thanks to the excellent FOH staff for taking care of us and the kitchen for the inspired food!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner with a girlfriend. The ambience is lovely and the service was great. The cocktails were delicious (we arrived after 7, wish we had known about happy hour!). The food was awesome. I am vegetarian and had a good number of options. I started with the pickles because I am a sucker for pickled vegetables and was pleased by the variety (inc. sun chokes and Enoki mushrooms!) the cauliflower dish was a great unexpected combination of flavours (capers and toasted hazelnuts?), the burrata was delicious, fresh, and it was so pleasant to have a vegetarian dish with fresh unique flavours and lots of protein. My friend had the fries with chicken skin and the lamb burger and said it was great. When the dessert menu came we had to share the apple ricotta cake and the chocolate delice - both fantastic. The prices were great for the quality of the food which is a rarity for restaurants in Wellington Square. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday after happy hour drinks from Rosewater to try out their Winterlicious menu with my friend who is the biggest foodie I know.  I really hope she becomes a Yelper and starts writing reviews soon as she has a palate like Rachel Zane from the tv show Suits.  She also knows her way around the kitchen quite well.  

As you walk in through the doors, the restaurant is very dark and is dimly lit.  We were immediately greeted and seated.  Good thing I made reservations as I noticed a long list of reservations made by others as my name was checked off the list.  Near the end of the meal, the restaurant was almost at capacity as I believe it seats about 50 at a time if I'm not mistaken.

I ordered the chicken liver & foie gras parfait, 72 hour short rib, and chocolate delice.  My friend ordered the roasted cauliflower soup, albacore tuna and lemon custard.  $35 for 3 courses.

chicken liver & foie gras parfait - pickles, marrow butter crostini.  This was the highlight of the meal.  The texture and taste of the pate went well with the crisp crostini.  The pickles were kind of odd to me but didn't bother me.

roasted cauliflower soup - hazelnut, caper, preserved lemon, brown butter.  The soup was very creamy, seasoned well, and not too salty.

72 hour short rib - parmesan semolina, cipolline onion, bacon, mushroom, horseradish.  The meat was very tender and moist.  The sauce and sides were a tad salty to me, but went well with the short rib.  The meat portion is quite small as it was only about a 3-4 ounce serving, about the size of a deck of cards.

albacore tuna - coconut broth, bok choy, tofu, anise ash, basil.  No doubt this is an Asian inspired dish.  The tuna was cooked to an excellent rare.  Although it says coconut broth, it tasted like some Tom Yum soup was added to the mix as the bok choy and tofu tasted a little sour.  

chocolate delice - peanut, salted caramel, olive oil, Maldon.  This was very rich as it tasted like dark chocolate truffle.  

lemon custard - candied macadamia, shortbread.  Biting into the candied macadamia confused me at first as it taste like tiny balls of meringue.  I enjoyed it since I really like meringue.  The lemon custard was sour, but that's to be expected.  

Service was great!  I really liked it when our waiter served our dishes and announced the name of the dish with a brief description of the ingredients.  

Took 1 star off as:

-meat portion in the Entrée's were small and could have been a little bigger (I find that portions are smaller in restaurants downtown compared to restaurants uptown.  Might be the higher rent cost associated with being located downtown)

-pickles in the chicken liver & foie gras parfait dish was really odd to me 

-lemon custard was too sour for my liking"}
{"text":"From the fantastic service to the mouth watering food...you can`t go wrong with this place! The pork belly and bone marrow are two particularly yummy choices! Thank you Stanley and team, this place is always one of my top choices!!"}
{"text":"Tried the fries with fried chicken skin, but it was okay. Nothing special. The pork-belly dish on the other hand was delicious.  

I didn't see a host/hostess at the door when I entered for dinner but the bar tender was very friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"The food was unimpressive and over priced. Luckily we had a promotional coupon. Had we paid full price I would have left felt feeling completely ripped off. 

I had the lamb burger which was too greasy and the bun tasted a bit stale. It came on a small appetizer sized plate. Um ok that was a bit odd.  I ordered it with a side salad that was essentially a radicchio mix in a Cesar type dressing. Very bland and boring. I probably should have chose the fries instead. You can't really screw up fries. 

My friend had the tuna on a toasted mini baguette. Feedback was that it was salty. It was also a very small portion. 

Another friend ordered the muscles. They came with a choice of fries or bread. He chose the bread and what came was a plate of thinly sliced plain toasted bread. Looked so unappetizing. 

We were there during lunch and the place was very quiet. Probably a reflection of food and prices. This place probably makes its money as a bar but as a restaurant it was a disappointment. 
Would not return and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Overpriced food. Every plate has three bites and cost at least $16. Definitely a no no"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch with my mom, the food was very good (had the fried chicken club) but the service was absolutely outstanding! The Asian lady that served us was super nice, super happy, always smiling and was very attentive. I rarely see people like this so I really want it to be known what a great job she did and what a lasting impression she left on us. Thanks for making our day!"}
{"text":"Smooth and romantic.  This is how I will describe the drinks, ambiance and service of this fine establishment.  What a great place to come for eating before a show or concert.  Small plates of delicious food delivered by very courteous and knowledgeable servers along with dreamy cocktails.  I would like to drink everything off the menu.  I had the St Germain, which reminded me of summer and I had the taste of the Cannonball Cab Sauv, which was sexy and bold.  I came here before a concert and they got us out in good time without feeling rushed.

We had the fries, which was righteously salty and crispy with great flavour since the chicken skins were addictive.  The cauliflower was inventive with the hazelnuts  giving it a roasted and nutty complementary taste.  The pork belly was sublime and unctuous.  Thank goodness the portions were not excessively big.  I think as small plates they were sufficient since they were so flavourful and the drinks provide a nice relief.

I will definitely recommend for drinks and romantic dates.  Maybe not for a big group but for two it is perfect.  I cannot wait to come back here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a long train ride from Aldershot. Being a first-time solo traveller, i searched up good dinner spots near Union Station, and i'm glad this place popped up. It's a quick walk from Union station, unassuming exterior, chill interior. Definitely an upscale sort of place to have a date or grab some nice cocktails with friends, their drinks ranged from $12-17 per cocktail. Very nicely made. The bartenders/waiters, Felipe and Matt, were extremely accommodating and friendly, and i highly enjoyed my interactions with them. I ordered the E36 tartare, which was a beef tartare with pear, truffle aioli, and egg yolk served with a side of crisps. It was the best beef tartare i've ever had--moist, tender beef seasoned with soy sauce and sesame with the sweetness of pear, pine nuts for texture and a nutty flavor, and sesame for a hearty richness...it was definitely a flavor and texture journey that my mouth enjoyed taking. In fact, j had more beef than cracker/crisps. Felipe, the server, got me more of the crisps. One thing i will say is that i would have preferred if the beef had been cut into smaller pieces. There was 1 or 2 chunks that had some sinew left in it, but it was still amazing. 


As far as drinks, i had their Ziotto and the Nutcracker. The Ziotto is very herbal and balanced. It leaves you feeling as if you danced through a grassy green meadow. The Nutcracker had strong notes of vanilla with a cardamom finish to it. Both of them i thoroughly enjoyed.


Overall, i would certainly come back. Atmosphere was chill and calm, music was appropriate, service was excellent. Food was tiny but soo worth it. If i lived i Toronto, this might by my go-to drink spot. But that beef tartare....."}
{"text":"I live about 50km from the city and try to come in here for food and drinks as often as I can.  All my meetings in the city have been rerouted to this place.  The food is incredible but is still overshadowed by the amazing cocktails and service.  I can't compliment the staff enough on their level of service and professionalism.  Doesn't matter if you're on a date, boys night, hanging with friends, or trying to have a meeting you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a early Friday evening for happy hour.  Bartender was very helpful in suggesting a low sugar cocktail for me.  I ended up with a lovely gin cocktail that I had never tried before.  My partner had the Smoked Boulevardier which was expertly prepared.  For nibbles we tried the fries, calamari and spicy peanuts.  The chicken skin with fries was excellent-- i could of just ordered a batch of the chicken skin it was that good.  Calamari was tender and the pickled cucumber garnish acted as a nice palate cleanser.  Peanuts were fresh, warm and complimented our drinks.  Service was outstanding we were well looked after by staff.  Prices are average for the area."}
{"text":"I only came here for drinks late night, didn't try the food. 
Service was good, although a little surprised about how empty it was on a Sunday night. I can't recall the name of the drink, but it was a signature, whiskey-sour style cocktail. Pretty decent. 

I'll have to come by another time to try something else off the menu and maybe try some food."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, once mainly to get my drink on and the other for a full on meal. The major factor for this being a 3 vs a 4 star review is the speed of service during my dinner visit here, it was a Saturday night and the place was pretty filled up so I'll give them that, but a 3.5 hour dinner is pretty unacceptable, especially given how it took close to an hour to get our bills all settled up. 

This place is not a failure though, they do do their food well! The plates are shareable-ish, but the mains can be had as a single entree if desired. Between the duck and pickerel I far preferred the pickerel but the duck was still very delicious. 

Their cocktail menu is also very impressive, if I'm being honest I've had better cocktails for the $13+ price range, but the list sounds interesting enough that on repeat visits I would keep picking from the cocktail list vs. going for a beer. 

They have a fancy area in the back that you could reserve out for a big group and on my last trip here, they were setting up for a 20s themed party and the staff were fully committed to the theme as well, so full marks for that. Maybe that could explain why service was slow? 

Overall, this place looks fantastic, I totally dig it's classy decor and the slow service certainly has not deterred me from coming back here, but at the same time I don't have an strong itch to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Very cool vibe...dj was playing and she was such a cool spirit...busy but not overcrowded, cool french industrial decor, and good drink (mojito royale). Nice stop!"}
{"text":"Love the decor and vibe of the place. Service is great too! We went for the soft opening of Brunch unknowingly. Mimosas and caesers delish!! Tgey offered everyone a free mimosa, what a lovely touch!  Food was good. I would just like to say that they should add another duck taco to the plate and not to bake the shells..they were a little crunchy and I was still hungry. Will definitely go back for dinner and drinks now that this is my new hood"}
{"text":"This place makes the BEST Mojitos I have tried to far in the city! And I am a total Mojitos snob!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a lunch on a Friday for the first time and it is quite a pleasant surprise. The decor is polished, chic but not intimidating, very warm and welcoming. Price is reasonable for the well executed food (the gnocchi was fantastic and addictive, my friend loved the double-decker fried-chicken club as well) and the staff is absolutely great. A great lunch experience."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday, where we got the semi private dining area near the back. It was a great atmosphere, but I can't say the same about the food and value. 

The menu looks really appetizing on paper, and everything is listed in one column, the top half is tapas style, the bottom where it triples in price are entree sized portions, but they were a pretty good sized portion that sharing would be a must. 

We started with Fries, which were as expected that comes with a homemade aioli. The chicken skin wasn't that apparent on in the basket.
Next was the beets. It was okay. 2 different types of beets on the plate, but I didn't find it anything special even though it looked really good on paper.
The buratta cheese didn't taste like much. A little bland and didn't melt in your mouth as I thought it would. 

The Fall Salad with all the bitter greens (kale, raddicho and endive) seemed like it was missing something sweet like apples or raisins. It was a little difficult to eat, or maybe and acquired taste. 

For $16 the bone marrow, was a good sized portion, but aches me to think each bone is about $8 each. 

Lamb burger seems like it was the most worth it. For $15, it was hearty portion size and was quite tasty. I also liked my Pork Belly a lot. 

Overall, it was okay, but I had higher expectations perhaps."}
{"text":"Amazing place for Sunday brunch. The chicken and waffles were simply amazing. Easily the best I've ever had. The prices are very reasonable, and the staff was fantastic. Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"I received a gift-card to East 36 and I was excited to try out this new spot. I went during winterlicious and I regret to inform you that it was not what I expected. The only reason why I did not enjoy my meal was because a lot of the choices contained a nut product. My soup had a nuts, my steak had nuts and my dessert had pistachio. I am not a fan of any nut products and this was a total turn off. If more than half the items on the set menu contain a nut product, they should really rethink the dishes for those are allergic or just purely does not like them. The ambience was okay..not amazing but definitely crowded and disorganized. I made a reservation through opentable for 7pm and did not get seated till 7:20pm. There is no space to wait inside so you are in between diners at the table and squished between guests coming in and exiting. Tiny place..would not recommend."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but totally worth it. The old fashions are amazing, the service is smart and knows what you need before you do, haha. My favourite things were the bone marrow with the fois gras and the scallops. The chocolate peanut dessert is also mind-blowing. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went there for Valentine's Day dinner. We didn't make reservation and we didn't have to wait. But the food did take a while to come out after we ordered. 
We started with kimchi fries. It's not as good as the ones from Banh mi Boys. We also ordered Lamb burger and Grilled squid.  Burger was awesome. Highly recommended if you can take lamb. There was strong taste of mushrooms and the sauce within the burger was very tasty salted and sweetened with a little bit acid. But the squid didn't come out so good. The side veggies tasted good, not the squid though. 
For drinks, we ordered rouge passion and rum row. If you like sweet cocktail, rouge passion will be a good option. 
Overall, the atmosphere and environment were super nice. A little bit pricy but you don't really care when it comes to a special occasion."}
{"text":"Okay number one the cocktails are outstanding. Number two I had the oysters (which are strangely not of the menu, and not labelled with an origin) BUT incredibly satisfying at $1 per oyster. I ordered six.. maybe should have ordered 50. Fried chicken was glorious, and get the bread. The dishes come out far apart if you are ordering shareable plates and it's a good buffer. Great service too. So much better than a lot of offerings in this neighbourhood 10/10. Would return. Tomorrow."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good! Owned by some of the coolest guys. We were served very well on a late Sunday night and treated very well for a table of four. I would recommend the fries and the bone marrow they were amazing. Didn't have a chance to try a lot of the other food items but there desers are amazing and they have a very good gluten free desert that is crazy good. 

Half priced wines sunday is amazing! The vibe is chill and casual, welcoming any crowd of people. Definitely will stop here again with friends or a date. After 12 they play some cool hip hop but nothing too loud so you can still converse with your group. In the end we left very happy. It was a way better experience than some of the bars we went to on king west."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday.  It was Sunday night and the wine is half price for a bottle.  Good to remember!  The menu is interesting, lots of sharing and small portions.  We really enjoyed the Arctic Char, Cauliflower and Burrata.  The service was very attentive and spot on.  The manager came by to chat and was very friendly and helpful.  Great for a pre-show drink or dinner.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I came here in a party of 9 for a Summerlicious dinner earlier this week. While I thought the food was overall okay (but on the more positive side of okay), the service was really excellent.

We had a reservation made for 7pm, but due to some extenuating circumstances, we didn't get our table until 8pm. While ordinarily I would be less than pleased, the staff at East Thirty-Six offered us a free round of drinks (and then a second round when our table was delayed even further) as apology for the long wait. I tried \"A Mid-Summer's Night\", and had sips of \"Rouge Passion\". Overall, I'd say that their drinks are decently strong, and not overly sweet. They only had one bartender working the bar, so be prepared to wait a little bit for your drink if they're busy.

Now, for the food! 

Pre-app: Fries and fried chicken skins with garlic mayo. I didn't really care for the fried chicken skins, but their garlic mayo was really delicious.

App: Summer salad - celery, fennel, radish, green onion, tomato in a creamy dressing. I wasn't too enthusiastic about this one. My friends who ordered the other two apps (cucumber gazpacho w/ smoked salmon, or chicken liver) were happier with theirs. 

Entree: Flat iron steak - the steak was sous vide and cooked to medium (they aren't able to do any done-ness more rare than medium). The steak was excellent. It was juicy and cooked evenly throughout. I was more than happy with this one, although their vegetable garnish (grilled zucchini) was bitter. 

Dessert: Chocolate delice - this was more of a block of chocolate ganache with a piece of peanut brittle on top. This dessert was too rich for me even though I love chocolate - there wasn't enough salt on it to balance out the sweetness.

Back to the service: 

All throughout dinner, the wait-staff were polite, friendly, and attentive enough without being overbearing. They were continually apologetic about the delay at the beginning of our meal, but I'm pretty sure all of us were over it by that point (that's how well they handled it). 

Overall, I was pretty impressed by East Thirty Six. I often find that restaurants offering Summerlicious menus will \"cheap out\" somewhere when serving their Summerlicious diners - but not here."}
{"text":"This restaurant will get a 5 star from me, the day I learn to become more daring and brave with my palette, till then 4 star it must stay. 

I absolutely love dark restaurants because it creates a more intimate dining experience wether your going for drinks, full sit down dinner or just trying to hide an embarrassing pimple on your face. This one so far has been tied with Spirit House for its gothic ways. Our server was an amazing, delightful and such an amazing man. 

Dinner Menu: 

Fries - $6salted chicken skin, lemon aioli

Octopus - $23smoked fingerling, tonnato, olive, charred onion

Beef Carpaccio - $16kimchi, cured & set egg yolk

Halibut - $26artichoke, zucchini, carrot, beluga lentil, lemon balm broth

Bone Marrow - $16chicken liver parfait and toast

There was no complains on our table, everything tasted amazing except the fries with the chicken skin which I still don't understand to this day lol All the dishes are tapas style which is great for sharing and experimenting other plates. 

As for the cocktail menu, I believe my friend and I ordered one of everything, I think there was only 2 weird tasting drinks otherwise the rest were delish, wish I could remember the names but we were pretty intoxicated at this point LOL 

Be extra wild and let the servers order for you!"}
{"text":"As most people have commented on Yelp, amazing and attentive service. The food was delicious (sweetbread! yum!) the portion sizes are conservative but that is ok with me. Good wine selection and relaxed atmosphere. 

I've been there a few times, as it changed ownership and concept over the years, and I must say the current version is my favourite. Will be going back, when I go see shows at the Sony Centre."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars and that is primarily because of the tiny tiny pours.  Ordered apps and had a few glasses of wine.  By the glass wine selection mostly french, so if you don't like french wine, you are SOL.  Apps were all fantastic.  Service is very professional and good.

My biggest complaint is the tiny pour.  Wine pours were ok.  Anemic, but ok.  Liquor pours were ridiculously small.  Could barely see the liquor in the bottom of a rocks glass.  One sip and it was gone.  Felt like they used a thimble to measure."}
{"text":"Came here the first night in from the states. The food was pretty decent for a late night menu. The drinks were also pretty good. The ambience was really dead but it was late and the night before NYE so it was a quiet night. I feel like the food took a while to prepare but the waiter was really nice.  A really pretty establishment"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for drinking and chatting. Their tapas selection is definitely not lacking and cocktail menu offers a variety of liquor (and are very pretty too!)."}
{"text":"Awesome drinks! Fantastic service! And great oysters!!!! 
Keep it up! 

It is a great find in the city with a great location. I highly recommend this establishment as a destination for dinner or to relax after work if you are nearby."}
{"text":"I came here for some after-concert drinks and apps. Even though it was Saturday night and the restaurant looked busy when we walked in, our party of two was seated promptly at the back. After perusing the menu my friend and I decided on the garden blossom drink and bone marrow to share. Our drinks came out quickly and smelled lovely with hints of flora notes of lavender. We nursed them while waiting for our food,which took a bit longer. 

Once the bone marrow arrived at our table I knew I was going to be in for a treat. The dish comes with the bone marrow (duh), a tower of toasted baguette and a chicken pate. The bone marrow was cooked to just right and had dried chives sprinkled on top. The bone had a generous amount of marrow in it, so that was a plus! The chicken pate was really good as well. I would have asked for more bread to finish up the pate if I wasn't so full. Although it was so good that I probably could have just eaten it with a spoon, but I was really full already. 

The ambiance is dark and very romantic so it's great for a date. The music isn't too loud either so you don't have to shout to be heard. The space is smaller so it feels very intimate, however I did see a large group seated across from us so they do cater to bigger parties."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little restaurant tucked in the corner bar st. Lawrence market. The ambience wss great but the food and service was really so so. We all ordered items from the winterlicious menu. While my cauliflower soup was not bad, the main was a little disappointing. I ordered their so called 72 hour short ribs. I was expecting an extremely tender portion of ribs with meat falling off the bones. But in reality, I had two pieces of very chewy beef ribs, not tender at all. On top of that, the mushrooms was extremely salty. 

The dessert was a like custard, the presentation was not bad but the taste made me feel like eating lemon curd jam from the Robinson's bottle. Too, too sour! 

All in all, a disappointing experience despite a great ambience."}
{"text":"I just had their fries and a beer. The fries really stood out because they garnished the dish with crispy chicken skin. I'd definitely give it a try if you're there, but apart from that, I didn't find anything else to be impressed by."}
{"text":"Ended up here unexpectedly on Thursday for the Grand Opening and was pleasantly surprised at what I discovered: completely unpretentious service, great cocktails and simply delicious food.

Having already had dinner, we ordered a few items (duck confit, bone marrow and pork maillard) to share.  They were all delicious and the portions were generous so value was definitely there.  Cocktails were also well made, but this should come as no surprise since the owners were behind Boutique Bar (winner of TO's best cocktail bar in 2013).

Overall, we felt totally welcome and loved the vibe of this place.  Can definitely see it becoming a regular hangout spot, or a pre-Pravda dinner spot.  Also the owners, husband-wife team Julien & Devon Salamone, and Stanley Bernard, were incredibly welcoming.  I have a feeling they have another success on their hands."}
{"text":"We arrived for happy hour for oysters and they had none, no bone marrow, no fried chicken, no kimchi fries. 

We ordered rubbery calamari, tuna tataki on soggy lettuce. The foie gras was decent. 

They also screwed up the happy hour specials and we needed to pay full price. 

Bright overhead lights. We needed to ask them to dim them. Music was on an interesting blend of EDM and pop. 

Overall poor experience. Our bill came out to $90 with tip. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"As my Travelzoo voucher was about to expire for this place, I decided that I should make the effort to check this place out.  Boy I'm glad that I did!  

It looks smaller than it is, but there's lots of room inside, a long bar area if you just want drinks and a private area in the back that can hold a small group (looks like 6-8 people).

The drink menu is impressive- lots of their cocktails you won't find anywhere else.  Unique ingredients that come together deliciously!  My friend had the Kir Provencal and I had the Garden Blossom

For food we ordered a few different dishes.  Most of the dishes can be tapas sized portions with a few of the heavier meals (short ribs, albacore tuna etc) are larger in portion size.  We ordered the fries with chicken skin (oh my yummy they were so perfectly fried and crispy!), beef carpaccio which was just perfect, beef short ribs which were a little tough but still nice and the albacore tuna in this light and lovely coconut broth.  Delish is all I can say

The service was so lovely but a bit slow only b/c pretty much everyone had the voucher to use as it was the last day.  But everyone was friendly and answered all of our questions.

This is a great date place - very upscale inside but not in a pretentious in any way.

I can't wait to go back here again!  New fall/winter drinks in a few weeks per the server"}
{"text":"East Thirty-Six was recommended to me by the concierge at Trump Tower. I had dinner reservations but was looking to grab a cocktail. The cocktails were very well made and each one had a specific aromatic flavor. Would have ordered dinner as well because the food looked amazing, but as stated, had a reservation elsewhere. I would recommend friends and family try to eat at this location while in Toronto."}
{"text":"The quality of the decor far exceeds the quality of the food. We tried 6 dishes and there was not one we would try again let alone call good. Very disappointing. 
The only reason I'd return would be to sit at the bar and enjoy a drink. As mentioned the decor is really nice but there are a ton of great places to go just for a drink."}
{"text":"Pro: Outstanding welcoming staff, friendly, patient, and attentive. really I was impressed by the staff from the moment I reserved on the phone till I left the location at night. TOP! 
nice romantic set up, not tight space. nice deco. 

con: I ordered the Korean beef tartar. I honestly did not like it. The meat was kind of chewy. Other dishes were ok-to-good. Dessert Menu needs some work, so I did not order! The portions of Tuna, Humboldt and salmon dishes, are really small for that price, and each cost over 10$. So if you add 1 appetizer and 1 drink to your main, you won't get a real meal with less than 30$

I believe I could find better and larger portions for the price elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here last night (Wednesday around 10:30pm). Good service, friendly and not pushy or too aloof. Tapas/sharing style menu with daily specials as well and great cocktail and wine lists. The cocktails we tried were excellent as were the various food items. The chicken skin fries are salty, but I like that. Razor clams might pass on next time. The short ribs were amazing as was the grilled asparagus. Also tried tuna tartare (in green tomato water). Delicious. Great for an evening after a play or the ballet. Decor was nice too. I don't know if I'd go back just because there are so many places to go in Toronto but I'm also glad I went and wouldn't hesitate to recommend. On the pricey side- be warned. 5 drinks and 6 tapas/plates came to $200."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday and what a great choice! Classy and quiet enough for a large group to converse as it's not a big restaurant. Overall the group felt the dishes were all quite heavy and hearty. 3 stars for food + 1 for the ambiance. 

Oysters - $1 each that night

Fries - best of the night! Wish I ordered this for myself. Its the salty, duck-fat frites style.. with some chicken skin and garlic aioli but just as good on its own. I love fries!

Bone Marrow - huge portion, could share this between 4-6 people. (we had 1 per 2 and it's veryyy rich and heavy after about 2 toasts). The marrow was very solid and fatty.. could use more seasoning (like caramelized onions?)

Razor Clams - disappointied at the portion size. was expecting long piece of clam, but it was chopped up with other ingredients that I had only 2 bits. Flavor was fresh and interesting combination of fennel, mint, citrus, but needs more meat!

Lamb Burger - quite pleased with my selection! Smelly from the goat milk gouda, but a yummy juicy burger. 

Berkshire Pork Belly - tastes a bit like Chinese roast pork/cha siu. I love the fried egg on top. 

Short Rib - tried a piece and it's very soft and tender but others said it's too salty and was only lukewarm.


Dishes were served sporadically, so we were there for 2.5 hours. Not complaining though, it was a nice ambiance, good for group birthdays or a date."}
{"text":"Popped into E36 for a dinner & drinks meetup that my friend arranged yesterday and I can only conclude that it was an alright experience - nothing remarkable. 

The service was average because the waitress that served our table was not very \"present\" and kept shuffling back and forth between tables that it was hard to get a hold of her. When I did, I ordered a grapefruit cocktail by the name, Pink Jalisco. The ladies at the meetup ordered Lamb Burger and French Fries with Chicken Skins, which were both well received."}
{"text":"Great staff, great music, and only true French aka France place in TO for night life! Bring on #Paris"}
{"text":"Although, I feel this place is more known for the drinks, Im only going to review the food as I was not able to have any of the drinks. 

One of the best tar tars I've ever had too. I was hesitant to try it only because it was raw meet but it was mixed with the right enough sauce. Wish there was more of it though as half the plate was covered with the shrimp chips. Kim chi fries tasted good as well despite the other reviews. If anything I felt it could've used more sauce as some of the fries at the bottom barely had anything. 

We made reservations through open table and had no issues getting a table. Although the place was just half full I felt it wasn't really necessary at the end to make the reservations but better safe than sorry!"}
{"text":"Delicious and unusual sharing dishes. Not big portions but very flavourful and unique dishes with great presentation and service. Had the scallop crudo and pickerel with matsutake dashi. Nice atmosphere and great location. Great innovative martinis, had the autumn jacket with bourbon, chestnut liquor and maple syrup. Prices are reasonable. Not for someone with a hungry appetite though!"}
{"text":"First of all, this is not a $$ place, quite pricey.  Atmosphere is amazing but the food was too salty in general.  Kimchi fries are not bad. The ribeye is good but it is not worth of $46.  Good place for drinking not dining."}
{"text":"Came here for the buck-a-shuck deal and the oysters were amazing. I've tried the 1$ oysters literally everywhere in toronto and this place had the most amazing ones. the only issue was that they only gave us 4dozens so that they could keep the rest for other customers that was kind of rude since we went al the way there for the oysters and they didn't even mention a limit on their website. we got really annoyed over this. I also had the kale salad that was really bad. my friend has the squid and I hated that one too. overly the location and service and oysters were nice but I don't really suggest anything else."}
{"text":"Came here in the winter, a few months back. We wanted to get some happy hour drinks and oysters after work. The place was empty aside from one table that was finishing up.

We both ordered the martini special, I don't remember the price. I asked casually what kind of gin was in the martini, not like I was expecting something premium or anything for a happy hour special. The answer that I was received was cold and unprofessional. The bartender said coldly, 'bar well'. Come on, just tell me it's the cheap Beefeater, whatever, which is what it was. 

We were ignored for the most part. The two bartenders seemed to have had friends visiting at the bar, where we were sitting. They were all talking about their rent. Blah, blah, blah. We didn't feel welcome. We decided not to order the oysters. 

The drinks weren't good. Service was indifferent. Music was a bit funny as it seemed like one of those ambient chill CDs from the late 90s. Thinking about the music still makes me chuckle a bit. Thinking about the service that we received that evening still leaves a very bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious. Had the cauliflower soup, albacore tuna, and lemon custard dessert. 
Food was subpar, everything was warm not hot, therefore food got cold before you could finish. When I mentioned it to the server he offered to warm it up. 
I don't think they cook it to order as food came out instantly, the only thing I enjoyed was the dessert. Ambiance and service was excellent. I might try this place again after winterlicious considering the positive reviews, but not likely."}
{"text":"The drink menu! Wow!The restaurant does an amazing job of making delicious drinks with a house twist. Great bourbon. Knowledgeable Bartenders. Classy bar. Five star bar. Recommend E36 B. House aged bourbon.

The food is also 4 star. Great starter menu items such as bone marrow compliment the cocktails and lead into the decent variety of dinner menu items for a classy restaurant. Braised beef with an egg on top. Awesome.

I would come for an on time lunch or a late light dinner to sneak in those cocktails, meet the right people in this classy yet sexy atmosphere, and start the night off with a bang!"}
{"text":"It was a Sunday night with me and another girlfriend. Very chilled out ambience, waitress was very easy going, kitchen staff very professional. 

We had two apps. The kimchi fries and the cauliflower. The cauliflower was soaked in oil hence it was very greasy. Nonetheless appetizing. The kimchi fries were yum :)

The mains were the lamb burger and confeit chicken. Chicken was dry and lacked in flavor. The lamb was very VERY pungent (I know lamb has a distinctive taste and smell but the lamb obviously was not prepared properly or old!!!). We packed it to go hoping my boyfriend would eat it.

As much as how the food should be delicious for the price we pay, the service was delightful. Left The restaurant on a good side."}
{"text":"I had read the great reviews on Yelp and my hotel was close by so I decided to give it a shot, so glad I did.. Thank you fellow helpers your reviews did not disappoint.  The bone marrow appetizer and pate were great.  The short rib entree was a favorite of the table as well.  The service was on point and the ambiance of the restaurant is romantic and cozy as well as modern and chic. Loved this place, so happy I went."}
{"text":"Great place. Very nice decor. Food is delicious. Definitely one of the interesting and unique places in the area. Suitable for dinner as well as a drink. Great for date or just a bar hop with friends. If you don't want fancy but would like to keep it nice,  I would recommend this venue."}
{"text":"Very cute and intimate place. It would be perfect for dates, but I was there for thanksgiving dinner with a friend. It was still great atmosphere though. We were lost in the conversation so I didn't bother taking pictures of what we ordered. Comprehensive cocktail menu! Food menu was meant for sharing. We ordered 5 in total, 4 from the Meat section and 1 Sprouts salad which was decent. I'd go back again, for food or for drinks."}
{"text":"Six of us met here Saturday evening before heading to see live theatre. Place is steps from the St. Lawrence Centre for the arts. 
The restaurant has a casual, upscale ambiance. We started with drinks and appetizers. Drink offerings are very diverse and well paired to meals. Complimentary bread, baked onsite, arrived to the table warm and toasted. 
For main courses we tried the Lamb Burger, albacore Tuna and beef short rib entrees. All were beautifully presented and so flavourful. Paired with fresh herbs, vegetables and exotic ingredients such as coconut milk, it was a meal that will last in our minds for some time. To top things off, for desert we tried the chocolate deluce and lemon custard with coffee. Absolutely wonderful. This restaurant is great for dates, medium sized gatherings or just stopping in for a drink and appetizer."}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place for a while and it was good (though I definitely think it's more of a drink than food place).

We ordered the kimchi fries (so underwhelming, DON'T DO IT! soggy fries and a little kimchi and some some mayo - with very little pecorino flavour), the humboldt squid (pretty average calamari, with no tentacles for those who are tentacle averse), the sword fish (nice play of fish n'chips with no chips, but nice potatoes and sauces on the side), the pate and chicken liver (GET THIS! it's delicious and the mustards that come with it are amazing!), and the e36 caear (overdresse kale caesar with crushed curtons on top for a different textural component, the anchovies were a nice touch)

The Rouge Passion was delicious and not overly sweet with subtle flavours, the Tranquillo was bright and sweet with a nice whisper of absinthe."}
{"text":"Loved the cauliflower! Not a huge fan of the fries. Order the halibut w/squid ink (like a light gravy) you'll not regret it! 

Side note: first time to Toronto so I didn't know about the 'winterlicious' menu. Apparently it's only for a limited time, and I was initially bummed bc I saw on their website and it looked amazing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Try the tuna and the ribs . The desserts are delicious too. But the best of all are the cocktails. Chilled out place , but pricey but worth it ."}
{"text":"The staff were very friendly and prompt. Both the Short rib dinner and the Lemon Custard with macadamia nuts and shortbread lived up to their excellent reviews. The slow roasted beef melts in your mouth and would not normally be my selection, but with the rave reviews, I just had to try it myself. It was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Their chicken + waffle is the best! And that Rum Row  So goooood. Must try. And very friendly and awesome customer service as well :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, we went a little earlier on a Friday and it wasn't too busy but there was lots of accommodating staff to ensure everyone was looked after promptly. Good wine, and our waiter kept refilling (which I love) shared the beef carpaccio, scallops (good, served raw but a small portion) and the fries with fried duck skin. All yummy. Definitely going back again soon :)"}
{"text":"I commend this place for its unique menu. It's quite pricey though for small portions. We ordered squid, kimchi fries, Berkshire pork belly, and shortrib. The squid was fried and cut into cubes. Kimchi fries were could have had more sauce. The porkbelly was my favourite from the lot. The shortrib had a funky aftertaste that disappeared if you eat it with the purée it sits on. 

Overall the flavours were okay but \"weird\". I wasn't used to the flavours. If I were to compare each dish against one another they would be of equal caliber. But if I compare it to similar dishes at other restaurants, unfortunately, I've had much better. I'm glad I tried this place though. They might be better for drinks."}
{"text":"Super conflicted review here..

We got the sword fish and bone marrow (added an extra bone). The bone marrows were amazing. Loved it and love how it came with chicken liver parfait. The crunchy toast tones down the fattiness of the marrow. On the other hand, the sword fish dish tasted odd..very odd. Not in an \"expired\" way, but maybe I wasn't used to the soury taste? The broth didn't taste like coconut and it was a bit sour.

This review would be a 3 star given the sour broth, but my Bon Vivant cocktail was beautiful. Definitely my favourite bourbon cocktail I've had so far..and not usually a fan of bourbon."}
{"text":"i really didn't like this place. service was slow, we weren't in a rush so not a big deal, but there was only 5 other groups in the restaurant so not sure waht the hold up was.  

this really felt like a \"me too\" place. Unoriginal in any way.  Nothing was really bad, but nothing was that great or stand-out.  From drinks to food, i felt like i'd already been to this restaurant.

i won't be going back."}
{"text":"The bone marrow was a little too congealed, but the chicken liver mousse was a good compliment. 

Seems like it might be trying too hard to be cool."}
{"text":"This is undeniably one of the best places to go out in Toronto, p-e-r-i-o-d.

Whether going out there for dinner, or just for drinks, it's incredible how this place actually works for both. The cocktails are really well mixed most of the time (just those right proportions and combinations), and the quality of the food is just incredible. The decoration, and the mood and feel of the bar and restaurant is also really well done: it's both classy yet old town Toronto homey.
Yes, Toronto absolutely needs more places like East Thirty-Six!

Chef Brent Maxwell is really putting on a menu selection that is varied and always high quality cuisine. You can tell that anything this chef serves will be unique and extremely well cooked and marinated, with just the right sauce and accompaniment. And the menu changes with the seasons, so I never get bored of coming back, whenever I can and am nearby.

E36 is one of those hidden gems you found here and there in the city, that don't advertise themselves too much and keep it low key, not to ruin it for the regulars. The food has undeniably strong French influences, meaning pretty much any starter or main prepared and served will taste incredibly great. It's all about the sauce and the right flavor associations, if you know what I mean.
The octopus is probably the strongest item there is on the menu, and is really to die for. I swear that no other cooked octopus has ever tasted that amazingly good before.

Some reviews mention it is \"pricey\"... they seriously haven't been to many other \"trendy places\" or chains that are ridiculously ripping off people in the city and serving them overtly salted unflavorful food. For the price of the starters and mains you get, and the very high food quality and cuisine you received, E36 is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Fantastic bar! Incredible drinks. Awesome oysters. Great atmosphere.

One of the only places in this area open on Sunday or Monday too. 

Some of the best bartenders in Toronto"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and the food was very tasty.  The portions are a bit small for the price point.  The burger special and pasta were very good (there was a pasta with a glass of wine special).  Desert portions were large - the chocolate one of very rich tasting.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"It all started with Pravda next door refused to let us in because my friend and I were \"under dressed\" for their fancy schmancy scene last winter.

Perfect enough, we then discovered a better place to grab a drink just a few doors down :) East Thirty-six (E36) is a great place for an intimate date or a fun GNO. I have been here a couple of times and I really enjoyed their food, drinks, service, music and the cozy and welcoming atmosphere! They also have an impressive bar and an extensive drinks menu ;)

Reservations
Make a reservation if you have a larger group. The semi private area at the back is great if you want some intimacy. You can now make a reservation, hassle-free, via Yelp! Stanley will then promptly follow up and confirm your table for that evening.

Parking
There are streets parking left and right in front of the restaurant. But usually on the weekends, your best bet is to park at that gigantic, multi-level Green P on The Esplanade, and then walk over to the restaurant. Not too far of a walk :)

Appetizer
The fries came with a refreshing homemade lemon aioli and was topped with strips of crispy chicken skin as garnish lol. It was unexpected and you know it is so bad for you but you eat it anyway! Make sure you share this with someone!

Entree
A lot of Yelpers mentioned about the Arctic Char, so we gave it a try. I thought it was decent :) The mushrooms, the lentils, the nice creamy sauce, the beautifully seared fish - all the flavours go well together. The Lamb Burger was delicious. The patty was juicy and tender. But I wish the bun was a bit more grilled/toasted. Mine didn't come with fries, does it normally come with a side of fries?

Cocktails & The Bar
E36 has an interesting hand-craft cocktail menu and I would definitely like to check them off the list one by one lol. I had the one with elderflower and one with ginger candy... both delicious! Bartender BJ was fantastic. Sitting at the bar watching him make the drinks was quite an experience. It was hilarious when my friend and I wanted to order 2 \"Blowjobs\" (BJs) and bartender's name was coincidentally BJ hahaha... \"Can we get 2 of you, please!\" LMAO. Yea, my friend was soooo cheesey, I know #facepalm lol.

Desserts
I have tried all three! Apple ricotta cake was very light. I loved the warm molten chocolate cake with the candied nuts! There is something about the tart lemon mousse that made me continuously eat it - I think the chunks of shortbreads and macadamian nuts really made the difference!

Verdict
Hell yes, I'm definitely a returning customer ;) Some complained about the service... the place can get quite busy, but they do have a watchful eye. I think service was friendly and overall it was a good experience. When you have good company, good music and a nice cocktail in you hand... nothing else matters anymore hahaha. E36 also opens late everyday until 2am. Great for late night drinks! Now, who is up for a drink? :D"}
{"text":"I discovered this place this place by a complete accident back in 2014, shortly after they opened and have remained a loyal customer ever since. Their special NYC like environment and ever surprising special menu truly hooked me up. Sincerely friendly and remembering you staff has definitely been a factor too... Their tapas menu constantly changes yet portions are quite ample. You will not leave hungry, however, you may want to try every item on it. I have brought numerous friends including a sceptical chef to this place and nobody felt disappointed."}
{"text":"Want to make sure you leave a good first impression, this is your destination. If I was to summarize my first impression of this place when I walked in the door it would be \"cool\". 

The wine menu is easy to navigate and still serves the classic six and nine. The bottle menu is fantastic and that glass menu let you explore great varietals at a reasonable cost. The Chianti  is particularly memorable. 

The food menu is simple, sustainable, and thoughtful. Inclusive and yet filled with a little adventure with each dish. It might push the limits of the most conservative of diners but you never feel like the chef is trying to ram their opinion down your throat. Their use of balanced spice in the meals is fantastic. 

If that's not enough, the staff are absolutely five star."}
{"text":"Loved. Explained to my waiter that I saw the reviews on Yelp. I came into see if it lived up to the expectations. It sure did. He was thoughtful, creative and attentive. The food was interesting. We did the cauliflower, chicken fries, and bone marrow. That (BM) was a bit much for my palette, but I'm happy I tried it. My waiter/bartender (I sadly forgot his name) suggested to drink the whiskey out of the bone to catch the flavors. My date made a messssss! Before I let it go down the shoot, the other waitstaff stopped me and ran to the kitchen to grab a creamer so it would work better as he pored it in. That was so considerate. Even if it was because he wouldn't have a HUGE mess to clean up. 

See the video I posted for the embarrassment. Also notice bib. 

Favorite thing I tried: cauliflower 

My friend: fries 

The staff was amazing and defiantly made that joint. Go..... Just.... Go."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday late afternoon for drinks & apps-- empty restaurant, tons of servers, but all appeared lost & unable to tend to us-- the only customers in the restaurant. Drinks are alright- they want to be cool & creative, flavours just aren't there yet.
We ordered the octopus-- prob the priciest app on the menu, and it was garbage! Undercooked, couldn't chew it and when we asked for it to be fixed, we were told the chef doesn't agree w us. Alright, why doesn't this chef go back to culinary school (like a real one!) and learn how not to serve bad food.
 All in all, do not waste your time. Servers were nice but inattentive, it's just another wanna be trendy spot, with no substance."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful birthday celebration dinner here last night. Reservations made online were easy and a confirmation call was received the afternoon of the meal. I'll start out by saying we could not have been an easy table! I have Celiac disease, my friend has an anaphylactic peanut allergy and her husband is gluten intolerant. The manager served our table because of these food issues and did a wonderful job of guiding us on the menu as well as coming back and checking if he was told by the chef of possible cross-contamination. The restaurant also very graciously allowed us to bring in a gluten free birthday cake that my partner had ordered for me. They brought it out with a candle on a China plate then took it back and cut and plated it. Overall, the service of the night was excellent. 

It is a small plates style restaurant and everything is presented beautifully. There was not one dish that we didn't enjoy and we ordered a second order of the beet salad it was so flavourful! We shared the beet salad, razor clams, ontario pickerel, short ribs, duck confit, buratta and fries (i abstained from the fries-they are fried in the same fryer as gluten products). As we ate we commented on how surprised we were by the different dishes. The buratta was sweeter than expected, the razor clams were chilled rather than hot and the pickerel was hot, not chilled. These were all pleasant surprises based on our (incorrect) assumptions taken from menu description. 

The decor is beautiful - purple walls, black furnishings, black and white photos on the walls and lovely light fixtures. 

The cocktail list is one that makes me want to come back frequently to try a new one. 

A great way to spend a Saturday night with friends!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the food but deserves 4 stars for the service! 

We went for an early winterlicious dinner at 530pm. We were seated promptly and our waiter was very attentive and funny. 

My friend originally ordered the cauliflower soup and didn't like it. The waiter was very nice and let him try another appetizer - the foie gras which he was satisfied with. I had the winter salad - basically caesar dressing over kale. It's on the creamy side with cheese on top but very satisfying. 

I would recommend the 72 hour short rib for the main. The albacore tuna was so-so, they paired it with the bok Choy and tofu which I didn't think worked well together. 

The desserts were all excellent. The lemon custard and the warm pear pie were both so delicious! Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner on a Saturday night. They didn't seem too busy (lots of couples, definitely some empty tables) so our group of 10 was definitely the biggest table. 

I will say this - the reviews about this place are spot on. Yes, the food is good, yes, the atmosphere is cool, but man is the service atrocious. 

I think we waited about an hour for our bill, and had to ask for it multiple times. When it came it was wrong and had to be sent back. Cocktails took at least 20 minutes to arrive at our table. Food came out in waves (far apart waves). 

The servers were friendly, and I wouldn't totally write this place off (assuming you don't have plans later!) but WOW were they slow. 

They also were setting up for a private party in their back corner, a 20s themed one. It is the absolute perfect place for something like that, if you're looking!"}
{"text":"Want to add $$$ signs to this restaurant. Food is not bad in terms of tastes.  The price looks inexpensive but they come in small quantities.  The drinks are expensive too, so it adds up to be a pricey place for dinner, to a point which I don't find it's worth it.  The service is casual the place is casual but not the price.

I came here mainly for the bone marrow, it's a very small portion even I added extra bone. It's short and shallow, not much you can eat."}
{"text":"East Thirty-Six is a great place to take a date! Its intimate atmosphere and great cocktail selection make you want to spend hours here :)  I really enjoyed the Cauliflower dish which had a great mix of capers, lemon, brown butter, hazelnut, and parsley. As for cocktails I highly recommend the Golden Era (which closely resembles an old fashioned). I'll definitely return to try more tasty libations that E36 has to offer!"}
{"text":"Great local spot.   Fantastic staff...warm welcome ... don't miss out, go here!   You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Cheap oysters on Monday - buck a shuck.
 Bartender makes amazing drinks. Had a neat Manhattan and a magical cocktail the bartender made. Should be on the menu as Christmas in July. Chicken skin fries are also a salty treat."}
{"text":"This review is only based on their drinks, which were amazing. I stopped in here with a friend for a cocktail. The bartender was amazing. We sat at the bar so it was cool to watch him make all the drinks. He was knowledgeable about different types of drinks, wasn't annoyed by phrases like \"surprise me\", and took pride in each of his creations. 

This would be a great spot to grab a drink before doing something else on a date or a cute night out with the girls. It's a little fancier of a venue, but certainly not stuffy. It's not too expensive either, just feels expensive when you're in there so that's fun! 

I wish there were more appetizer options for foods to munch on, but for drinks it was great! Didn't try any of the entrees."}
{"text":"Came here last week for a friend's birthday. It's a beautiful place that serves modern French bites. 
Drawbacks:
I'm giving this three stars because I found their dinner menu to be quite limited, there weren't many choices and not many dishes stood out to me. Food was good but not memorable. I probably won't be back. 

Service:
Service was good, we were a big group but the food came out fairly quick. 

Food:
Lamb Burger 
For the price of 16 dollars it was quite a small burger. This was unfortunate because my friends really enjoyed it and thought it was delicious! Some even joked saying that it was more of a slider than a burger lol. 

Short Ribs
This was what I got and I was really satisfied! The meat was juicy and everything on the plate complimented it well.

Fries 
Our friends ordered this and it looked so interesting with the fried chicken skin on top that we decided to order one for ourselves too. In the end it was nothing special. Just regular fries with deep fried chicken skin on top with a side of their dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Having my flight canceled, i had to crash one more night in Toronto.  I randomly picked that place which should be called a little gem.  Barman was very easy going and nice, great wine and awesome food.  Octopus is sooooo good !"}
{"text":"Went here with my manager and a client. As I was responsible for choosing the restaurant I did a lot of background research beforehand. 
Let me tell you something, our Yelp community cane through for me. The reviews I read were very helpful and the food as well as the service were on point. 
Great place for a good weekday or weekend dinner - Lamb burger was the juiciest and most flavorful lamb burger I have had so far."}
{"text":"This place is a real hidden gem! Everything on the menu is super delicious! The service is amazing!"}
{"text":"It's a small quaint bar resto, perfect for after work. A female DJ was present near the entrance. If you drink, they have special drinks from 4-7 pm. 

I went there for the food, knowing it will be small plates. The waitress suggested that all dishes are meant to be shared. 

The menu is selective, but that means that they have perfected these dishes. Veggies - 4 choices. Fish - 6 choices. Meat - 8 choices. 

Fries with salted chicken skin: over rated and not worth it. 

Sprouts salad: it came with Brussels sprouts but I was chopped up finely that I was disappointed. They should have just cut it in half. A very small salad for $13!  

Mussel escabeche: we were warned that it was a cold dish and it was quite interesting. I liked the spice that they used. The pickled fennel was the winner for me. 

Lamb burger: two bites more than a slider, but surprisingly it was filling. They put the sauce aside for me which was nice. No tomatoes or pickles which would have been nice. 

Bone marrow: my friend had this dish, and she enjoyed it. 

Happy:  the dish came out in good time and we were able to try many dishes. The service was great! 

Not happy: after one hour of being there, it got quiet noisy that I had to yell over for my friend to hear me. 

Verdict: it can get expensive so get ready to spend. 2 girls is about $70. Tips and drinks not included. It's a nice place with a unique taste to the food, but I would not go there too often. It's a once a year thing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place out for Winterlicious and we loved it! The food was inspired, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for their buck a shuck oysters (mon-wed) during happy hour. The oysters were really fresh and the cucumber cocktail was refreshing. I didn't like the raspberry lemonade. It tasted like cough syrup to me. What turned us off was the staff kept going into the walk in fridge which is located in the dining room next to the bar and something in there was rotten so it smelled like decaying garbage! Every time they opened the door to go in and out, the rotten smell would escape and linger in the room. I swear they must have gone in and out at least 5-6 times in the hour and half we were there."}
{"text":"ok the is the RAW UNCENSORED I JUST GOT HOME FROM THEIR PLACE review

i rang in my bday there, and it was awesome, just amazing. stanley, who is one of the co-owners, is flawless. our other server, kaylee (sp?) was rad as hell, and knew her bourbon inside and out. a quality i love in a gal

all of the food was delicious. but omg. i'm a total carnivore and even i was over the moon for that goddamn cauliflower. 

i've been treated like GOLD when i've been out at restos on my bday -- fussed over, comped meals, shots, etc --, and while that's obvs not expected, i didn't feel that here. their treatment of us was so kind, but nothing out of the ordinary, if that makes sense? they're new, so i mean, maybe they are still figuring out how to make things Next Level for ppl on special occasions. that kind of attentiveness is the diff between a 4 and a 5 for me. 

all in all, i will absolutely be back. i really love the eats AND the cocktails, both are really thoughtful. i wish them the best of luck, and will def support them via enthusiastic cocktail consumption and fawning over their well curated / really effing amazing menu

def go here, is what i mean to say.


ADDENDUM: aka the morning after thoughts

i woke up wishing that i had one of their Borsalino cocktails and their bone marrow for breakfast, so that's saying something. 

things we ate:

mixed pickles
bone marrow
cauliflower
duck confit
cailettes & toast

for dessert, a beautiful apple-something with benedictine blue cheese -- usually i could take / leave dessert, but that was one of my favourite things of the night. 

actually, i wish i had all of it for breakfast RIGHT NOW."}
{"text":"I can count the times I've given a restaurant five (5) stars, but East Thirty-Six receives them easily!  The service was impeccable!  Each and every item that my party ordered arrived at the table flawless.  Don't walk, run to East Thirty Six!"}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious = great tasting food and great service! Highly recommend. The foie gras was so flavourful I wanted more. The short rib was good would just love to add roasted garlic but overall good already. There were 3 of us so we got to try all 3 desserts and the pear cake was my fave the sauce was amazing! The lemon custard was also good and the chocolate was good. The ppl greeting us at the door was cheery and made small talk and servers were all attentive and fast service! One time I was trying to catch a server's attention while he was hurrying to the back and he caught my eye for like 1 sec and came all the way back to see what I needed! Would go back to try their other food like the bone marrow!"}
{"text":"Came for a drink while waiting for friends.

Jack and coke..  tasted no alcohol and Diet Coke was used. 

I'm not lookin to get drunk but I wanna at least know alcohol was mixed."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great cocktails! Definitely a darker restaurant, so worth keeping that in mind when making a reservation."}
{"text":"On the first night of our Toronto trip, my buddy and I checked out East Thirty-Six, a bar downtown that stays open late. We arrived around 11PM and sadly, the kitchen was closed so we ordered a drink. Both of our drinks were fine, not amazing. Overall, it was a basic three star experience."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place through yelp and I decided to go here for dinner after the Raptors game. The restaurant had a few patrons for 10pm on a week night but the staff were friendly and seated us right away. 

My boyfriend ordered the lamb burger with french fries and chicken skins and I ordered the octopus. 

His burger was nothing special neither was the fries with chicken skin. The chicken skin tasted like KFC chicken and the mayo that vame with it tasted spoiled. 
 
My octopus came cold and there were too many flavours happening on the dish.

Needless to say we will not be returning."}
