{"text":"I've been here twice and I've enjoyed both my visits.  This place is really cute/clean/modern but more importanty the dessert crepes are very tasty.  I haven't tried the savory ones as savory crepes really aren't my thing but the dessert crepes definitely hit the spot.  I hate how some restaurants serve you really messy crepes.... But when you order a crepe from this place, it comes all wrapped up like a little neat little present.  I had a crepe filled with nutella, strawberries, and banana..... The outside was perfectly crispy, thin, and light while the innards were nicey and gooey.  Mmmm.  And the server/owner(?) reminded me a Robin Thicke.  I need to go back here soon!"}
{"text":"They are not opened as advertised until 2am on weekdays. Tried to sit down tonight at around 11:30pm and was informed they were already closed. Pisses me off that I take the time to look up their site online to double check the hours before meeting my date only to be informed they were closed. Total waste of time."}
{"text":"Since chocolate and banana is my favourite duo, I was pretty pumped to make an impromptu stop here for a dessert crepe. While it was big, warm, and deliciouslly filled with strawberries, bananas and nutella -  the dish quickly turned into a mucky brown mess. (Sort of made me feel like \"crepe\"). They put a lot of nutella inside the crepe and then cover the top with dark chocolate sauce. There aren't very many berries, and the berries are sliced so thiny you can barely see them. Ditto for the bananas. Overall, it just tastes like you're eating spoonfuls of melted chocolate - which is fun, but it would've been fun to get more of the flavour of the crepe too.   Also, while they're open late every night and have an extensive specialty coffee  menu, they don't have decaf coffee or decaf espresso. The only decaf teas are mint and chamomile.   They win on ambience. It would be a nice place for a few drinks or a date. It's dark and romantic, and our server was very friendly and nice (she was also apologetic about the lack of decaf). But, I agree with Kent P - worst name ever!"}
{"text":"I am so sad, this place has permanently shut down. Where am I going to find the best crepes in the city now? The place was clean, crepes made right in front of you, and they always tasted delicious and were great for takeaway in their special crepe boxes. I don't know if this review is even worth putting up because they're now out of business (as listed on their website) but I will be really missing this place. :((((((("}
{"text":"Its a quiet place with mood lighting with good desserts.  We each had a ...wait for it, crepe :) Our crepes were pre-made - they weren't made on the spot like they are at Marche. They were simple with all sorts of options for fruit and fillings but ice cream on the side. They had a nutella crepe which was delic!  it's a great dessert place to popm into after a dinner out on College st!"}
{"text":"as previously stated, i'm a crepe fan so i came here to see what it was all about. it's nothing special. the dessert crepes are pretty good but they are also extra sugary (almost too much) and tend to melt quickly which makes it difficult to eat if you take it to go.  the savory crepes are ok. simple fillings with a side of greens in balsamic vinegar which is a nice contrast. the only issue i have with this place is the prices. the crepes aren't packed with high quality ingredients so it makes me wonder why they are so expensive. crepes are very easy to make (and inexpensive) so you'd think if you are paying $9 for a crepe, you'd get something unique. not bad but overpriced."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a dead Thursday for a sugar fix. There was one couple in the corner, a few balloons at the front (from an earlier party, maybe?), and four people on staff.  The ambiance was nice actually - dark, tall booths, lights low, little candles on each table. Loungey music playing.  It was cozy- except for: the two tvs playing the 2002 Madonna flop, Swept Away. WTF? Why is this movie on. These TVs totally go against the vibe this place is going for. They're also distracting because who doesn't want to watch Swept Away. Screw conversation.  The staff was a little annoying. Our server was pleasant and dutiful- but the kitchen staff and whoever else was over there was obnoxiously loud with whatever was going on in their personal lives. Also a vibe ruiner. At one point someone was singing.  I'm no Crepexpert- but it seemed a little off. Got the \"Celeste\" : Nutella, Banana, Strawberry. It had like half a tub of Nutella on there. AND chocolate drizzle on top. Chocolate is OK- but you couldn't even taste the berries n' bananas. Sad, right?  Good: it is open late - and right across from the Royal theatre (I think their lights are out on the outdoor sign- tough to spot driving by at night).   two pats.  edit: wait a second - this place also has the most unappealing name for a business that is supposed to feed you. #namefail"}
{"text":"Best crepe I've had so far in Toronto.  I had the Victor and it was delicious!  The price of the Crepes is above what I would consider average for Crepes, but I think in this case you are getting what you pay for in terms of quantity.  I often have crepes that don't really make a whole meal when I am really hungry, but I was starving when I stopped by this place and was rather full 3/4 of the way in.  I also got a dessert crepe (Nutella and banana), which was delicious.  No one there when I went in on a Friday evening, which was kind of surprising.  It will take more time to get your food that at Cafe Crepe, more than likely, but they do make them fresh, which is probably why I think that the taste is better."}
{"text":"If you want to put the moves on someone and get your sugar fix, this is the place!  It's near pitch black with loud house music, with chocolate and  alcohol readily available.    The crepes here are dressed to impress. However, I find they overcompensate with nutella and toppings to make up for an average crepe.  At least I can wash down my dessert with a martini.  I've been here a few times and I find there are always loud and obnoxious people. It's like you are trying to eat in a club with seating while being forced to watch bad movies on a flat-screen.  We walked in here because of the cheesy name. We come back here because there are few late night dessert places in the area.  I don't really like this place all that much.  But if you are into crepes with a side of pretentiousness, then this is the creperie for you."}
{"text":"This is a great date place for deserts. Very quiet, moody lighting, nice decor, comfy couches for you and your day, and half empty most of the time. Too bad the crepes aren't that great but I like chilling here."}
{"text":"I Feel Like Crepe is an unpredictable experience. I've had warm, fresh Nutella and strawberry crepes that could not have been more delicious - I wanted to lick my plate clean. I've also been served cold, gluggy, flavourless ham and cheese crepes that I didn't even want to finish. I suppose it all depends on who is cooking. If I ever figure out which crepe maker has the magic touch, I'll post his or her description here as a public service.   If you can get beyond the cafe's nauseating name, the glossy, modern red and black decor is appealing. I have sat and watched 'Run Lola Run' and 'Hero' on the flat screens while I devoured (or picked at) my crepe. The staff easily accommodated a group of 16 for a work lunch, which I appreciated, but the service is slow-ish whether you are on your own or with a dozen companions."}
{"text":"I Feel Like Crepe.  I Feel Like you know what may actually be more appropriate for how we felt after dining there.  In fact, I've been there twice in the span of a year, with the last time just this past week.  Both occasions were equally poor.  Let's get the positives out of the way.  It is clean and elegant in a College Street martini bar kind of way.  It fits right in on the strip.  Also, on one occasion they were playing Breathless on the LCD screens, so thumbs up there.  Unfortunately, the positives end there.  Service is awful.  I feel this may be because they don't hire enough staff.  When we went on a busy weeknight, there was one waitress who had to take orders and prepare drinks and coffee, and one cook.  This was for a full room of maybe 30+ people.  Right there you knew, this isn't going to work.  Our crepe orders took approximately one hour to come.  One hour, for crepes.  Not good.    If you do go, get any Nutella based crepe, not hard to make it. Our friends ordered a fruit crepe, and believe it or not, the fruit was frozen.  I don't mean they use frozen fruit, that's understandable. I mean the fruit was still partly frozen when it was served.    The latte was poorly done as well, but how can you blame the waitress who has to tend to a whole room on her own.  Won't go back, it's poorly run and the crepes are not good enough to make up for the poor service."}
{"text":"a friend got a deal coupon for this place so we decided to go check it out. was not very sure I'll like it after I read the reviews below but the place proved to be way better than described in many many reviews.  first. the ambiance as mentioned in the other reviews as well, is very romantic and great for the first or 1000th date=) candles, couches, chick look. very very nice.   2nd. the staff is very attentive. maybe the fact that it was empty the whole time we were there (4-6pm on sat night) added to their attentiveness level.   and the 3rd. the food was yummylicious! two of us had savory crepes (Luc: spinach, feta, sundried tomatoes) yummy! very very good and with a side salad. and one of us had a dessert crepe (Lucile: strawberries with nutella and alcohol(the name of which I forgot)) Yes there was looooooots of nutella and strawberries were cut thin. but the crepe never turned into mush and tasted delicious!  oh and the drinks! I had an ice coffee - frappe. it was super thick and very very delicious!  great for post movies hang out as it's located just across the street from royal cinema.   I'm sure they can always accommodate big groups too judging by their not very busy sat night."}
{"text":"I find their crepes dry and really bland in taste, even will all the options.   I give it too stars because its clean, the decor is awesome and they have come up with a cool name for the restaurant. Yes I do judge a book by its cover. :)"}
{"text":"One of four locations my friend and I ventured into on our Crepe Quest. Interesting how the food is named after people, however I don't think the waitress would have been too impressed if I would have told her we wanted a threesome with Clarissa. I even wondered if saying \"Bring me Clarissa on a plate\" would have been in bad taste. But I imagine they have gotten these comments on numerous occasions. However, I consider it a lost opportunity, another yelper can pick up the reigns and push forward where I held back. Anywho.. The crepe was tasty and had a good flavor all around. It wasn't greasy, had crispy edges and had enough filling that we felt it wasn't a waste. 7-12 dollars per crepe does seem a little pricey, but looking around the place I imagine you are paying for the atmosphere mostly. Not a bad spot if you are in the area to contemplate your cannibalism while you munch."}
{"text":"Was driving on college with my friend looking for a place to sit and have a quick dessert and I read the sign for the place - \"I feel like Crepe\" - and I swear it was reading my mind!! I really was feeling like crepe and they didn't dissapoint! haha   I got the Margot with the biscuit bits and it was reaaallyy good. Just enough melted chocolate and hazlenut - a little bit more and it would've compteley overpowered the crepe but it was good. My friend had the Noelle and if you like dark chocolate, that was reaally good as well.   The place is modern but homey as well with the TV in the back. Server was nice and friendly and I think next time I'll try their main crepes and not just the dessert ones!"}
{"text":"During the \"Taste of little italy \" I've tried it and it was awesome , yummiiiii"}
{"text":"Really cute decor and a good place to sit and eat. I got the panini and it was pretty good. My friend got the nutella and banana crepe and she loved it.  Im giving them four stars because of the price -- a little overpriced but i guess i cant expect much more in this area."}
{"text":"Loved the decor. The crepes were disappointing. AVOID the martini's. They are actually quiet poor.   Worth going if you are really in the mood for crepes and cant find anything else nearby."}
{"text":"Holy crepe.  I had the Celine, which contained dulce de leche, bananas, and hazelnuts, This was the sweetest, richest crepe I've ever had.  It also was the most expensive (8.99!) and maybe even too sweet and rich.  Service was prompt (although it wasn't very busy  - 7:00 or so on a Sunday night), the decor is nice, and the crepes were nicely made.  They also have an extensive martini list (which I did not try).  I could give this a higher rating but not at $30 for crepe and coffee for two."}
{"text":"Bland crepes, fake canned whipped cream, slow service, gross dirty bathrooms. Don't let the initially nice interior fool you, there are much better crepe restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"When this place moved into College street I was really disappointed, I was hoping for a creperie, we didn't need another bar.    After avoiding it for a year I finally gave in and finally realized what it's good for: First date Weekend Brunch After dinner dessert Martini night with the girls (great martini list!)  I actually ended up having my bridal shower there!   Igor, the owner, is lovely.  Try it.  I think he's actually opened during the week for lunch now too.   I just wish he'd turn the music down."}
