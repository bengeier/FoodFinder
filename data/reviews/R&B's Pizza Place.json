{"text":"Have been here twice in the past month. Hole in the wall place with a large menu. Pizza, burgers, calzones, subs, etc. Good, greasy pizza. Fast service."}
{"text":"I ordered the Yinzer hoagie.. holy crap!! no point in ordering this, you are better off eating a habanero pepper and chasing it with a bottle of franks extraspicy red hot! I split it with a coworker who \"loves spicy food\" and we both threw our halves away. Another coworker ordered the buffalo chicken salad.. she also threw it away on account of the firey blaze in the mouth. I will try again, but will NOT be ordering anything with their signature buffalo sauce on it."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza at 2:45am and they said 30 mins at 3:45am I figured they weren't delivering it. I get that they closed at 3am on Saturday night but then do t take me order if you don't plan on delivering it..."}
{"text":"Doughy pizza with a bad sauce. 

Plus I ordered mozarella sticks and they did not deliver them, charged me for them, and refused a refund. 

Do not support this business."}
{"text":"Best hoagies ever and fast delivery!  You guys are the best!!  Delivery was fast and the delivery guy was professional.  Highly recommend. If your staying in town, forget the rest and order the best!"}
{"text":"Just ate a slice of Feta & Spinach pizza. Pretty tasty! Definitely a cheesier pizza, and the crust is doughy with a slight fried finish around the outer edges. Tastes way better if you have been drinking, but honestly what doesn't? If you're ordering from here, stick with straight pizza and you won't be disappointed. 

Especially recommended if you have been able to sneak a few drinks at work ;)"}
{"text":"We did take out and we were staying at a hotel downtown.  The service was quicker than the 40 minutes they stated.  We ordered the hot sausage hoagie.  Half a hoagie is about six inches.  A full is about 12 inches.  We also ordered a gyro, breaded mushrooms and a can of soda.  I would pass on the breaded mushrooms but the rest of the food was very good.  They charge $3 for delivery."}
{"text":"I'm never ordering from them again. 
Tonight I placed an order through the Order Up app from R&B's pizza. I received a phone call about an hour after my order that the driver was here, so I told him that I would come meet him outside. Instead of getting off the phone the man proceeds to explain that I'm not in the delivery area for them. Okay? So I told him that I ordered through an app...thinking how is this my fault? Doesn't stop there though, he continued to boldly and rudely remind me that they don't deliver to my area and next time my order will just be cancelled and not to order again. Fine by me, but I shouldn't have to get scolded about ordering from a restaurant when I placed the order through an online ordering food app!! That's ridiculous. I'm also mentioning this to Order Up especially when I thought it was their hired drivers that did the delivering?"}
{"text":"AWFULLLLLLLL!!!!! Please do not give them any business- horrible customer service and I have been in the business for a while.  Not the way a customer should be treated.  My food was late (the delivery man admitted that he had to go somewhere else before) and the food was ruined.  Do everyone a favor and leave this place alone."}
{"text":"Worst wings I've ever had.  Over fried.  Sauce on the side.  The garlic sauce is literally just garlic butter dipping sauce.  Just nasty."}
{"text":"I ended up all alone on NYE 2014, and wandered a mile back to my hotel room. It was around 1am and was hungry, so I called the front desk checking on my food options. They transferred me directly to R&B, and ordered a pie for $12.  The pizza arrived within 30 minutes, and it was pretty dang good. The delivery guy was friendly as well. Can't beat the convenience and quality, thanks!"}
{"text":"Do not order from this pizza place. The \"manager\", Rick, is rude and unprofessional. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"So I've stopped into this place a few times while needing a late(r) night bite to eat and waiting for my bus. The pizza was decent. The bacon & cheese fries were just ok. We ordered them and since they took a while we ended up asking for them to go - I feel like that may have rushed them a bit into thinking we were impatient, so maybe they would have been better if they were in the oven a bit longer.

I've had better - but I've also had far worse...."}
{"text":"I always do delivery. They're very quick. 
I normally really like the food here. I normally get chicken and broccoli with alfredo sauce. Its good, though the chicken is very chewy. 
My big complaint is when food comes undercooked. I ordered shells with broccoli. The pasta shells are all undercooked and broccoli is raw. That's not okay. I'd honestly rather have my food come overcooked than undercooked."}
{"text":"Coming from New York (city and central), pizza is a big deal to me.
Moving to Pittsburgh, I definitely had some serious pizza withdrawals when I moved down to the city for school. 
If not for R&B's, I would definitely still be feeling these effects. Yes, it's pricey at full menu price, but with the College Special option for students (or even anyone looking like a student, I've never really been asked to show ID when ordering) you can't go wrong.
Don't get me wrong, it's no New York style pizza but the taste leaves something to be said for. Something about the flavor is certainly memorable (in a good way, that is)."}
{"text":"You know how some things even out?  That's what kind of happened here.

Wanting something new I convinced everyone at work to order from here.  The menu differs a bit from the other typical places.  Collectively we all thought this was a great thing.  That is until the ordering process started.  We had a little bit of a misunderstanding while ordering from phone.  So much so that some items that were ordered did not show up.  We could have gone around this hiccup and not have had such an experience if we would have went another way of ordering.  You can order online or through an app.  According to the menu we have, if you do order from the app you get a 5% discount.  After the food arrived we had to call back and make them aware of the mistake.  With a huff on the other end of the line, you could tell that customer service is something they need to work on.

As for the food, a majority of us that ordered agree that they hit it out of the ballpark.  I had the R&B's House Burger which comes with fries.  It's kind of like a mammoth burger.  Two thick patties with your choice of American or provolone cheese.  Burgers come with lettuce, pickle, onion and tomato automatically.  The burger tasted great and definitely was filling.  I kind of needed a nap afterwards.  The fries however weren't the best.  You could tell they were frozen from a bag.  Meh, you can't have everything.

Delivery time was fast, we are in Oakland and this spot is Downtown and we had our food not too long after we placed the order."}
{"text":"The wings were a little better than average, spicier than usual but with a sauce that was too dry. The pizza was Pittsburgh's usual disappointing facsimile of what a pizza should be. Too much cheese, too little too sweet sauce, too much dough."}
{"text":"Stay away.  I'm a woman that just experience verbal assault by a sexist manager.

This is the most disturbing experience I've ever had. They completely messed up our pizza order, took an hour to deliver it then an hour to come back and reimburse us then wanted the whole pizza back as if we should pay for their mistake by not eating.  when we told them we had already eaten some of it they wouldn't reimburse us.

When I talked to the manager about it he was rude.  He talked over me, When I said this was not very good customer service he said \"so what\".  

The managers name is Rick and he's sexist misogynist and a very bad man.  

Also the food is terrible."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would!!!! I ordered at 12:45pm, when I called at 1:55 to see where my food is because I'm less than 10 minutes away from the business, the lady hung up on me mid sentence, then refused to answer the phone afterwards. Then 25 minutes later I eat a call saying they can't find the address, I told him that I called asking where the food was and got hung up on and his words were \"oh, yeah, so do you still want the food?\" No thank you I've ordered from somewhere else seeing as I've been flying since 10am and I'm hungry now and if something is wrong with my food I won't be able to get ahold of anyone or get my money back. This place is horrible with their customer service and I suggest you don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I had their pizza about three times.  I feel that their pizza is just ok. Good, but definitely not great! I was very disappointed in the little sauce that they put on the pizza pie. As for the taste, again it is just okay."}
{"text":"Have I had better pizza in my lifetime? Of course. Have I had a better $16 extra large with extra cheese delivered to my home in Pittsburgh, our fair city? Not even close. It's good delivery pizza at a reasonable price, which is exactly what you expect from a place like this. Their Greek salad is good, and their veggie hoagie is filling and tasty. This is my go to delivery place, and I've never been disappointed with our order. We usually order on a Friday or Saturday night for dinner a couple of nights a month, and it's always delivered, hot, within 45 minutes. If you want good, greasy pizza, this fits the bill."}
{"text":"Blech. Lousy pizza. The hoagie I ordered was almost as bad. They do deliver quick, though. To Beechview no less."}
{"text":"The delivery is fantastic and fast and the drivers are always super kind. My only problem is that sometimes the food is just slightly undercooked, but otherwise i love it!"}
{"text":"Great, cheap, tasty pizza place right on Point Park campus, they're really friendly inside and the food is always quality."}
{"text":"Def Pittsburgh pizza
Small slices with sweet sauce and
Fluffy crust. Not best"}
{"text":"We ordered this late at night after an evening out an all 8 of us agree this was pretty decent pizza.  Plain cheese pie delivered fairly quickly right to our hotel room for 13 bucks."}
{"text":"Drove into Pittsburgh pretty late in the evening and thank goodness R&B is open late and deliver!! We ordered the chicken gyro and the chicken gyro platter - pretty yummy and decent portion size for its price! The highlight -- their chicken wings! They have the jumbo wings on special and wow, delicious! You must get the chicken wings with the garlic seasoning -- you will not be disappointed (hopefully)! :) Fast delivery, but we also account the fact that we ordered at 1130pm. Good choice though for late night eats!"}
{"text":"ABDOLUTELY by FAR the worst place of business EVER!!! I work at a local hospital, placed an order during my shift and never received my food until 2 1/2 hours after I ordered! The delivery guy was absolutely hammered and high, dropped my food on the ground in front of me as well as someone else's food, and demanded payment. The food was ice cold and soggy. When I called to complain to a manager, I spoke with a woman who barely spoke English and didn't care about my business or problems with the food. I HIGHLY recommend no one ever order food from this place ever! I threw away the menu in the hospital I work in and will make sure no one I know or work with will ever trust or order from these horrible people again!"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for work and found myself hungry and not wanting to leave my hotel. 

I ordered a grilled chicken salad and pizza rolls. The order was here before the estimated time and it was ALOT of food!!! The pizza rolls so yummy! They were hot and the sauce was perfect. My grilled chicken salad was huge! 

So good!"}
{"text":"Rude. After being told our food would be delivered in 30 minutes, 45 minutes later it had still not arrived. We tried calling to check on the status and before giving a name, number or order they said \"it's coming\" and hung up. We did eventually get our food, 15 more minutes later, but there was no reason to be so unprofessional. Luckily it was some good pizza."}
{"text":"We got some R & B's delivered late one night while staying at the Marriott City Center. The prices were great, and the delivery was mighty quick. Their pepperoni rolls were pretty fantastic-- soft and delicious, served with a swell, zesty pizza sauce. Their ranch, meanwhile, was unfortunately served in a store-bought pouch... alas. Their pizza was advertised as the best in Pittsburgh, and though it wasn't bad pie, \"mediocre\" is appropriate, so I hope for Pittsburghers' sake that there's better somewhere else in town. Still, a lot of bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I'll be kind and give them 2 stars for timely delivery and service. Other than that, the food was flatter than Roseanne Barr singing The National Anthem. 

R&B's describes itself as \"The Best Pizza Place In Pittsburgh.\" 

I think not.

If a doughy pizza severely lacking in flavor is \"the best,\" I'm moving. Thankfully, we have much better pizza parlors around these parts, so consider R&B's tagline a grave misnomer. 

The Ranchero Steak Hoagie had soggy french fries (check the bread too), Steakumm's-grade meat, cheese, and some ranch dressing to keep it from being an utter failure. 

Curiosity can kill the appetite. Thankfully I have more than 9 culinary lives. Meow."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery, and it arrived early.  Hoagies were good as was Greek salad though small for priced paid.  Also ordered buffalo wings and got spicy hot wings - NOT BUFFALO WINGS!!  According to menu, wings come with blue cheese, but we got none!!!"}
{"text":"The menu is a little bit on the pricey side for what's offered ($5 for a piece of baklava?  That's the most expensive I've ever seen).  The Yinzer hoagie, with chicken, buffalo sauce, ranch, cheese and veggies, sounded interesting, but you couldn't even taste the chicken.  Fries are just your typical frozen-fried variety."}
{"text":"I ordered Large Cheese Pizza, Whole Tuna Hoagie, Ceasar Salad and 2 liter of Mt. Dew.  Ugh.  What kinda crap is this? Pizza crust was HORRIBLE.  Sauce is way too sweet.  Then the ad that came to our house said that the salad was $3.99 however the website its $6.99!  On the website it says it comes with bacon in it.....mine had NO bacon.  NEVER EVER again will I order from this place.  YUCK YUCK YUCK!  My total bill was $30.00 too."}
{"text":"I just tried this place today. I ordered the gourmet Italian hoagy. I asked that the lettuce and tomatoes be wrapped separately  because I hate soggy lettuce and tomatoes. My order arrived on time and packed just like I asked it to be. The hoagy was so heavy with meat. I did throw the sub in the toaster oven because I like the bread to have a crunchy crust. I finished putting it together and it was really great.  I got a side of fries and they tasted good also. 

I will update when I get some other foods from here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! First semester, I only went here once and had a chicken sandwich. This semester, I've gone here several times because I'm addicted to their Buffalo Chicken Pizza! OH MY GOD IT'S AMAZING. R&B's puts crispy chicken, bleu cheese and amazingness on this pizza. They always serve it with a side of ranch dressing, which makes it even better! I love that it's open till 2am and the service is reasonably fast. Come check this place out!"}
