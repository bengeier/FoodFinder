{"text":"Service is alright.   Food on the other hand, is awful for Asian standard. The mango in the mango salad was not ripen enough and sliced into THICK strips instead of thin strips. When you chew on the mango strips, they are hard like bamboo. Seasoning was not good either. Pad-thai tasted like rice noodle stir-fried with ketchup and sweet sauce. The ingredient in the ton-yum soup was not the right choice either. Portion was small for the price as well.  You can get much better Thai/Vietnam food in 10 km diameter of this place."}
{"text":"AWFUL.  Rubber chicken and rubber beef. Terrible service.  The all-u-can-eat lunch special is the biggest rip-off I've ever experienced.  My partner and I left with horrible, bloated stomachaches.  They took forever to bring the main dishes...I think they were hoping that we would fill up on the deep-fried appetizers and order light on the protein and veggies.  The server actually left for the day and didn't notify us....we were abandoned for 20+ mins and had to walk up to the front to ask for the bill.  This is after we watched her sit at a table and text message for 10 mins.  You know this is not a real Asian restaurant b/c they charge for tea (!).  Lemongrass thinks they're Spring Rolls, but there is a reason why Spring Rolls is always packed and this place is virtually empty most days. STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I visited Lemongrass at the Square One location in Mississauga last night. I had heard mixed reviews about the place before, but never tried it. It was the biggest mistake.  I ordered the Shanghai noodles with chicken and shrimp and my friend had ordered the General Tao's chicken /w rice. First off, the food arrived literally 4mins after we put the order in, which we thought was very suspicious. Then when it did arrive, the portions for my dish was a paltry coffee plate size. The meal looked bland (imagine something a University dorm student would make in a microwave), LACKING complete flavour. There were 3 pieces of very (I mean very) thinly sliced chicken pieces and 5 pieces of shrimp. The noodles themselves looked like they were made that morning (so almost 12 hours of reheating and serving to customers) and the entire plate looked reheated (it was luke warm to cold in less than 5minutes). While my friend had about the same amount with a ridiculously small bowl of rice (imagine the fist of a 10 year old - thats how small).  Mysteriously right after his plate arrived, a fruit fly appeared buzzing around his meal which put us off. When we tried to flag down someone to get him another bowl of rice 3 servers showed up confused asking us again and again what we wanted. One ran to the back of the kitchen, then 2 minutes later another came out and again asked what we wanted. The lack of organization was appalling and it looked like the place was run by college students.  We were seated by the back wall beside the bar - the orange lighting was horrible as it made the menu pages look well..orange with no natural overhead pot lights.  After getting home I was stuck with an upset stomach and thats when I knew this place needed a review- a warning to future customers thinking of going here. In the competitive GTA restaurant industry one has to keep up with customer demands. I've been to many Asian, Panasian/Fusion restaurants around town and most have generous proportions and the pricing fits appropriately. However, with the small portion sizes and poor food quality that Lemongrass has demonstrated -they wont last long in this competitive market. If you like coming out of restaurants feeling like you've spent your money's worth, value your stomach and not feel used/cheated..then I'd avoid this place."}
{"text":"Favourite spot for lunch when Im at Square One.  Pepper beef is great!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing really impressed me about this place. I'm not even that keen on writing a review for it, however, i'll put in my two-cents.  Mediocre, that's as good as it gets. The food, presentation, our server, the service, prices: average. If you aren't looking for anything fancy but have to fulfill the need to eat and you're at Square One shopping centre, then hit up Lemongrass.   Despite its mediocrity, I have a couple honourable mentions: - the place was really clean and tidy - the Pho was flavourful, hopefully sans MSG"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. The soups mostly tasted bland and the reheated or resteamed rice definitely didn't taste fresh. I'd definitely pick Spring Rolls over Lemongrass, the next time around..."}
{"text":"The decor of the restaurant was nice. It had a very modern twist to it. The service was passable, however the glasses they gave us water in were dirty. The booth was not comfortable, the food was mediocre, and the soda was overpriced.  The Tom Yum soup did not have the right ingredients, the fusion pad thai was not very good, the rolls were not very good either.  However, I did like the Thai Mango Salad"}
{"text":"Their pad thai is made with no flavor but oil, it came clumped together and I could lift the whole pile of noodles with one chopstick. i only come back here for their spicy corn and vegetables sour soup you get for free when ordering an entree (YUM) but even that has gone downhill (really salty) last time I went. Not worth the price especially since thai has opened in the food court for the same caliber of food but at a fraction of the cost.  My mom likes this place only for their lettuce wraps and mango salad :s"}
{"text":"Went back for dinner yesterday and again was served by the friendly and efficent Michael!   Yippie for a cleaner dining room!  The food was quite good, with the exception of the spring rolls that were evidently cooked before we arrived as a mistake or something.  We had:  Spring Rolls Curry Pad Thai Red Curry Veggies Drunken Shrimp  and complimentary mango ice cream.  I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"Looking for Thai Food? Go to Thai Express in the food court not here.  I've been here twice my first experience wasn't the greatest, maybe it's what I ordered, the typical Pad Thai and basically got a snack and not a meal for $13. So I thought I would give it a second try, that second try will be my last.  The look of the restaurant though is very modern, clean, and well maintained. The staff working is very informative but seem very unhappy to work there only b/c I did not see anyone smile. You know if you smile at someone usually more times than not the person will smile back automatically, well that didn't happen here, it's like they've been trained not to smile.  My second visit here just happened to be during their 5th anniversary and they had a special ayce deal for $13 gratuity already included which was a pretty sweet deal considering I paid $13 for one dish last time. I took full advantage of this b/c it gave me an opportunity to see what's good and what's not.   To start of I had soup both the wonton and hot and sour shrimp soup. The wonton soup was the better one of the two it wasn't salty had the right amount of wontons, 2 to be exact for that size and tasted just right. The hot and sour soup was disappointing, for one I was expecting that thick rich hot and sour soup you get at Chinese restaurants which it wasn't, also, the soup was very sour and you only got one piece of shrimp in it, BRUTAL!  For apps the grilled chicken satay stood out the most, it was very flavourful and that peanut sauce as a dip was just right. For the main dishes the pad thai was just like I remember it horrible and no flavour at all, the fried rice was horrific, it's like they just left it as plain steam rice and threw in chicken and veggies to make it seem like fried rice. The lemongrass chicken was horrible, way to much sauce, the general tao, orange, and lemon chicken were good but you can just go downstairs at the food court and get that at manchu wok b/c it's absolutely the same. The garlic beef was very good not to much sauce and just the right spice, the mixed veggies in black bean sauce was very good as well.   To be a great restaurant you have to have that one dish that stands out from all the rest of the restaurants and fast food restaurants out there, unfortunately there wasn't a thing there that made me want to come back. So the next time I'm craving thai or asian food in general at the mall I'll just head to the food court b/c the food is so much better and alot cheaper.  Items to definitely get:  -garlic beef -chicken satay -mixed veggies in black bean sauce"}
{"text":"Service was good. The quality of the food however was not...  Came here for the all you can eat dinner. The first course of the lobster and pad thai was decent  because if the size of the lobster. The noodles were not flavorful.  The other dishes were just ok. Not worth the $60 for the 2 of us plus tips. I rarely post bad reviews but this one deserves it...."}
{"text":"Best Spring Rolls i've had. The food was alright.  However, the guy who takes care of the takeout is rude and impatient. I went twice and same bad service. This is why I won't go back."}
