{"text":"The other reviews were right, pizza was very soggy.  While I appreciate the fresh ingredients, I found it hard to enjoy them on top of a wet crust.  Also, the sauce was tasteless.  I did enjoy the flatbread and hummus.  I'll skip this place next time."}
{"text":"Famoso has never lived up to expectations for me. Every time I have been, the pizza has been bland and soggy. When there are other great pizza places so close by, there are much better options than Famoso. 

Many people describe this restaurant as family friendly, but if you do not have children to bring to a restaurant, and enjoy a nice atmosphere, this place is probably not for you"}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better\" sums this place up. 
I went there wanting to compare this pizza to other thin crust pizza joints such as UNA, double zero, etc. Walking in I was a bit surprized that it is designed more like a deli (walk-up order your own food) but they bring your food to you. Also, not a single smell of pizza!!! Open kitchen, smaller place, wouldn't you expect to smell some fresh bread, garlic, basil, cheese?! Nope, nothing.
We ordered 3 different pizzas: Ham and Pineapple with fresh Feta, Pepperoni and Roasted Mushroom, and Cappricciosa. As with other reviews we found this pizza a little soggy, and overall a little flavourless. The qualities of the toppings though were fabulous! The fresh feta was super yummy!
I would maybe compare this pizza to slightly thinner, less greasy pizza hut.
Overall, I don't think i will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"A nice looking restaurant with a beautiful stone oven and a mean pizza. Service was nice but nothing really to impressive, food arrived quickly and the portions were very big."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food and Cocktails! Love the concept of ordering and service. Presentation is brilliant for such a low key area, and I could eat the pizza everyday. Only suggestion is  more interaction with staff would be useful as they all seemed hesitant and unsure of when to come over and clear plates or ask for another drink order. This made us a little uncomfortable when asking for anything ourselves."}
{"text":"Tried the new Famoso in McKenzie Towne this evening - extremely disappointing.  My salad was very small, the dressing very oily and for the quality expensive.  My husband and I each ordered a pizza - they were both very, very soggy - my pizza lacked flavour as well (artichoke, cheeses, red onion, roasted red pepper)...my husband's pizza had more flavour, but was also very wet in the centre.  Disappointing as we live in the area and were hoping for a restaurant we could enjoy in the neighborhood.  Also disappointing that the chef, although he checked on us after our server told him we were not enjoying the food, did not adjust the bill at all.  Unfortunately we will not be back."}
{"text":"I love the crust at this place - soft and thin, but the edge is a bit thicker than the typical Neapolitan.

Also unlike other Neapolitan places, they not only sell pizzas with traditional toppings, but also some \"Canadian\" options like pineapple and ham. And, the pizzas are big enough to share. Something like 2 pizzas for 3 diners might be about right.

Nice salads, too."}
{"text":"I tried Famoso for the first time a couple of months ago - I had never heard of it but I am happy I did!  

My first impression was good - I like the semi-diner, semi-trendy feel to the place; I liked the tall table we sat at near the back; I liked the artwork. 

We were a little bit confused about ordering, but I think that is because nobody listened when she said that we were to order at the counter (shame on us).  Once we got settled in and the pizza came, we were happy campers.  The pizza is a thinner crust, Italian style pizza - right up my alley!  The sauce is tangy and fresh tasting, the toppings are fresh, and you get a healthy pizza for a good price.  

I would totally recommend Famoso to people who, like myself, are not huge fans of greasy, heavy take-out kind of pizza.  It's so nice having this option for a decent price!"}
{"text":"Went to Famoso Country Hills for the YYCPIZZA week special.  The pizza was delicious.  The service was atrocious.  We were given our bill before we finished eating our main meal.  The hostess came and started clearing the table while we were still finishing our drinks.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"One star for drinks and one for dessert. Pizza was disappointing. The crust was thin and soggy in the middle and the toppings were basic. I would prefer pizza 73. 
The drink I had was ok. Gelato was tasty."}
{"text":"Ive been here before,and normally enjoy it, but today was met with smiles and poor service. I just needed to pay and pick up.  Was not greeted at the door and stood in line on the side for 10 mins while staff made eye contact and walked by. I decided to stand at the front in hopes of being \"greeted\". Someone decided to greet the prettier lady who walked in front of me, even though i was here for 10 mins before. After being greeted, was told to stand in the line that said \"order here\". The one star is for offering to recook the pickup order which after waiting for 15 mins just made sense. 
Not impressed today."}
{"text":"I have had pizza here before that was pretty good, not so much now. I've had better frozen pizza...will never go back!"}
{"text":"This is on our top 3 list of best pizza places in the city.
Love the crust, topping choices, service and wine.
Our Friday night dinner and wine place...
The service is awesome. On $10 off wine night, our server forgot to discount the wine, when I mentioned it, the manager came over and apologized as it was the servers first shift and he gave us the option of the $10 or a $25 gift certificate. No brainer for us to take the $25...
Great place!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly but the pies were disappointing.  Soggy in the middle, probably needs a little more time in the oven and watching the toppings build.  Hopefully they pick up and it would be a gear neighbourhood place."}
{"text":"Summary:  Great food, good service & the dumbest ordering process I have EVER seen.  Poor layout.

As you walk through the door, a sign tells you to seat yourself and order at the counter.  Except all the tables are full, so you have to wait for a server to take your name, and hover near the front door as you wait for a table to come free.  This is the same area as the ordering counter, pathway to the washrooms, and is separated by little awkwardly placed railings.   We put our name on the list and waited 10 minutes to be seated - only to watch another table jump ahead of us.  When I questioned it, she said 'oh, Suzanne has already been seated'.  Umm no, that was us - she accommodated us quickly.  

When you finally get your table, if you're lucky, you get to study a menu (only one at a table of 4 due to a printing issue) and write down your order.  You then have to walk back up to the front of the restaurant, through the crowd of people, and yell your order across a counter because it's deafeningly noisy.  You have the option of paying at the time, or leaving your tab open in case you want more food and drink.  You then return to your table and a server brings over drinks and food.  

The food itself was good.  The I had the Moo Shu Duck pizza - nice light hoisin sauce that wasn't too salty and very tender duck.  The teens ordered a plain pepperoni, and a Vesuvius.  We all enjoyed the crust and toppings.  We took a Primavera home for the hubby - again, loaded with good toppings.  Add two sparkling San Pellegrino's, one cocktail (the Limoncello Lemonade was delicioso).  The kids insisted on, and devoured, the Dolce Banana for dessert, and I thoroughly enjoyed a single scoop of the Blood Orange Creamsicle Gelato which made for a fabulous palate cleanser.

When finished, the waitress brings over the bill and you can pay at the table.  The server was really nice, explained the procedures well (without rolling her eyeballs at the ludicrousness of it all), and got our takeout pizza perfectly timed for our departure.  All the servers were good.  

I'd love to give this restaurant 4-stars - but until they change the ridiculous ordering process to match the $100 bill (including tip) for a pizza dinner, I'm sticking it at a three.  You can't combine fast food procedures with fine dining prices."}
{"text":"Customers who review badly on famoso have probably never eaten really good pizza their entire life. If you think the pizza here is horrible, you are probably used to Pizza Hut who stacks loads of cheese and grease and your happy. I am honestly in love with this place, the pizza at both locations is amazing! The pizza is thin, non greasy, and cooked at the perfect temperature. I sometimes just come to famoso because I crave their coffee. Their coffee has the best, strong taste. I recommended you try their espresso! 

The atmosphere is nice, the colours are right and it's located in good spots. I probably would recommend the north west location because it's quiet big, has a patio and the best part ever ( has parking!) to sum this up, I am a complete fan of their whole menu and their amazing service."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! I wasn't sure if I would like the traditional Neapolitan pizza but it is absolutely amazing. We have been here twice and it was great both times. We ordered the mozza balls to start both times, mmm. I want to try dessert but when I go, I must finish my pizza and don't have room. One day!"}
{"text":"I love Famoso. They have delicious thin crust pizza, almost comparable to Pulcinella for a lot less money. They have an usual way to take orders, some people might not be ok with it as you need to stand up and go to the cashier to place the order. The food is then served by a waiter who also takes payment at the table. It is a very family oriented restaurant, so if you are looking for a romantic, quiet dinner this might not be a good option for you"}
{"text":"Yum!!!!

I'm not sure how this place slipped under my radar for so long. I really never noticed it on my many trips down 4th st. But boy, am I glad I went!

Pizza was delicious, thin but chewy dough, perfect sauce, and melted mozza. Mine was a little bit too thick in terms of the cheese, and could have used a bit more basil, I think only 2 of my slices had basil on them. But nonetheless, delicious!

Along with my pizzetta, I got a caprese salad which was yummy (this is my favourite salad ever) but lacked a bit of olive oil/balsamic. 

For both the pizzetta and caprese, I paid $14, which isn't too bad and I was STUFFED! but.. I still had to order the tiramisu, mmmm, nothing better than creamy tiramisu. 

Btw, a pizzetta is half the size of their regular pizza, perfect for lunch.

I'm looking forward to trying their sandwiches. 

Service was friendly and quick, and they didn't even judge me when I scarfed my food and some sauce slipped down my chin. 

Would be perfect to get a bunch of people together, order several pizzas, some bottles of wine, and relax!

I decided to change my review to 5 stars, I'm already planning to go back this weekend."}
{"text":"Worst food quality and customer service follow up ever experienced.  Meatballs burnt 1/3 way through - covered up with cold sauce and unmelted cheese, garlic toast burnt,  pizza soggy, greasy , undercooked except for the fresh arugula burnt to a crisp on top.
Immediately spoke to the owner/manager about wanting a new order or money back.  Was told the kitchen was closing and the delivery service deals with all the issues.  Did not take my name or number .
Contacted delivery service - they do NOT deal with cash refunds only credit.  They are attempting to contact the owner/manager on my behalf forwarding on the photos I took.  
Phone call to famoso day later -  owner not available."}
{"text":"Really nice authentic pizza!!! The caprese salad was a little small. Loved the atmosphere and it's location."}
{"text":"There is pizza. And then there is pizza. Some comes over-baked. Some comes under-baked. Some drips grease. Some drips nothing. As a lover of pizza, I dig a thin crust that snaps in my mouth and comes with a good glass of wine at a good cost.

Famoso is that. Have tried many spots here but keep coming back to Famoso. Will even drive in just to order, wait for it to be prepared fresh, and then drive away with loot in hand.

Never been? Get here. Get some. Get in on a well-kept secret in Calgary. Turns out I am finding more and more of the secret world in Calgary. Every. Single. Day.

Buon appetito."}
{"text":"Update:
The pizza is still great. I just love their thin crust and the different toppings. The reason I have upgraded my review, is they have finally have full service at your table. No more weird ordering process at the front counter.
Now there is great food and good service."}
{"text":"Very disappointed as we waited for almost an hour. Ordered the ABruzzoa and  bread was soggy. The Italian meatball sandwich was very sloppy made. Meatballs was overcooked and dry. Overall double dosage of just bad food. Need to shape up as it doesn't compare to the other location. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Wednesday evening at 8pm, looking forward to a nice quiet date night. Instead we had an awful experience that will result in never going to the 4th street location ever again. 

There was only one other table of people when we arrived, already eating, and our server (a young blonde lady) somehow didnt notice she had another table, as was too busy talking to her colleague. It was only when one of the kitchen staff pointed out our table and asked if we had been helped, did she come over. 

From there, things seemed pleasant, our drinks came at a reasonable time, and our orders were taken in the same amount of time. However, after our pizza arrived, that was the end of our service. No quality checks were done, our drinks remained in need of refill for about 10 minutes, and halfway through eating one of the slices we noticed a long blonde hair in one of the pieces. 

We sat there for another 10 or so minutes, before I finally decided to stand up and go approach our server myself, who was still standing at the bar talking to her colleague. I asked for a box for take out, and our bill, and for the first time in my life did not tip. 

We were very disappointed about the lack of service considering it was extremely quiet in the restaurant, and no quality check or a follow up for us even to mention about the hair."}
{"text":"Being from Italy I have to admit I love to dissect the menu and the kitchen whenever I read the words \"real authentic italian\".  I did not find any misspelled italian words which is a promising sign.  However, a couple of things did strike me.  The first is the type of flour used to make pizza which in Italy is usually \"0\" and not \"00\" as stated.  Then came the kitchen: a stone wheel turns inside a gas fired oven:  in my mind that already disqualifies the place from being called authentic, let alone Neapolitan.  Finally, there are hundreds or pizza associations in Italy, being associated with one is pretty meaningless.  But no big deal there. 

Let's get to the pizza.  It is a gummy one, it isn't crisp but it is somewhat thin, thus it is a Neapolitan style.  Don;t expect to find this type of pizza too much in Italy, the Neapolitan one is something you usually find only, well.. in Naples.  The taste was good, the ingredients were definitely fresh (I consider canned tomatoes fresh), the mozzarella was sliced and perfectly melted. Being cooked in a gas fire oven means no burn marks and uniformly cooked.  I like having some burnt sections on my pizzas.

Prices were not outrageous but neither cheap: $11 for a margherita pizza.  The place is interesting with the big windows and surprsingly confy chairs.  Atmosphere is very easy going.  Service was good.   So I would definitely come back here.  This is (finally!) the second place in Calgary that serves pizza that is close to Italian pizza.  The other one is Pulcinella."}
{"text":"Been here 15 min, three other tables who came after us had their dishes ordered and received their drinks.  The server finally came and said, 'oh, I thought you weren't ready!'  Thanks for ignoring us."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Great atmosphere! Got the Verde pizza with goat cheese, olives and basil. Yes, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in Calgary. The innovative menu, combined with authentic ingredients, makes this a must for YYC.

Wiseguy and soup by day, Palermo, a few Peroni's, and a Dolce Banana with Fiasco gelato by night.

Can't miss!"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place. I love authentic Italian pizza and had high hopes for this local pizzeria. After being there on 3 different occasions, I am sad to report that I have been disappointed every time. Three times, three different pizzas. Each time the pizza was soggy and left me with awful heart burn.

The service was OK, but the restaurant was loud. I really wish I could give this place a better review. We need a good pizza place on the West side of town, but alas, this isn't it."}
{"text":"Worst meal l've had in a long time.   Service was not great either.   Pizzas are flavourless.   Kids meatballs are way too spicy for kids.  Even my kids said the pizza sucked.  No stars here.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Really overrated - their food is dry, not very flavourful, not filling. And really overpriced.  The couple of times I've been the servers just do not know what they are doing - they \"auction\" off orders at the table, which is obnoxious.  There's lots of other delicious, less expensive places to go eat lunch at in Mission."}
{"text":"Great service! We went in with 3 toddlers and 2 babies and the staff there was very helpful! Made our lunch very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"We've had better for less money. This place is no screamer. We had 3 different pizzas to me it was a plain tasting pizza. Decor was nice but we didn't go there for the decor.I really give this place a 2 1/2 star."}
{"text":"I am, by no means, a connoisseur in \"'za's\", but I really appreciated the thin crust neopolitan pizza's that I've had there in my two visits. I always feel that you get a good sense of the kitchen by trying out the simplist things on the menu.  And so, I tried the margherita my first time there and I really enjoyed the fresh basil flavor with the thin crust.  The second time, I tried the Thai chicen which was quite unusual with bean sprouts, carrots a peanut satay sauce and cilantro. Unusual for a pizza, but it works.  It was actually quite good.   

Their salad's are also very well done.  I had the gorgonzola walnut salad and we tried it as a  salad pizza(the salad sits atop a pizza crust).  The salad was delicious. The concept of putting it on a pizza crust was unique and interestng.  Does it work?  No.  Not really.  The crust comes cold and hard and really the whole thing becomes a mess on your plate.  It's hard to know whether to eat the salad first or take the salad off the crust and eat the crust seperately or use your hands to bring the crust to your mouth while balancing the leaves of romaine on the crust.  It was a bit of a mess.

Nonetheless, Famoso has a great casual atmosphere and great pizza!  I would recommend it.  Go to Famoso's. Do it."}
{"text":"I had the Famoso Salad which was incredibly divine! 

It was a unique twist on a salad with tasty pita on the side. 

Great atmosphere at this place! I loved the self seating with great windows all around you to people watch on trendy 4th Street. 

Definitely a recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza we've had in Calgary, and beat Pulcinella in our opinion.  Loved the pizzas - had a ham/pineapple, a arugula & prosciutto white pizza, and a Korean beef pizza.  The desserts were excellent as well.  The ordering process *is* strange.  We ordered our appetizer and drinks from the front, and then sat back and ordered our meals and desserts the regular way.  Service was very good - thanks Kayla!"}
{"text":"The waitresses were so sweet and attentive, they really made the experience that much more pleasant. 
The pizza was alright but very runny, although we asked for it well done because my friend had that same issue with them before, and it didn't seem to make a difference. It was funny to the point that you'd pick up a slice and all of the cheese would slip off of the pizza, and it would feel very damp on your fingers. Not great. 
The Caesar salad was good, we had to add olive oil for it to actually be edible, but no croutons :( 

The atmosphere was nice, somewhat homey, and the kitchen is open so you get to see everything they're doing."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was just an off day given all the fabulous reviews of this place but the pizza looked delicious, but when it came to the table the middles were soft and slimy as if they were not fully cooked. When you pick up a pizza slice, you want it to hold straight, but this pizza just flopped over with the toppings spilling everywhere. The flavours were good but with the poor crust it was less than satisfactory. We found out after that you could get the pizza cooked well done but there was never any note of that. We will go back only because the hostess/manager was amazing and gave us certificates and a discount on the meal. Loved the atmosphere, just the pizza could have been much better."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try the pizza here for a while as I work in the area. Very disappointed. The atmosphere was nice and the ordering system was pretty neat, but the pizza was dry, had few toppings, and was even slightly burnt. I asked for ranch dressing in hopes to drown out the burnt taste and was informed by the woman behind the bar (rather pretentiously I might add) that they didn't have any. The only thing that made up for it was the fabulous gelato and our wonderful friendly server, I didn't catch his name but he was lovely. 

Long story short: not worth what they charge."}
{"text":"This pizza would be tasty if it weren't a wet, drippy mess.  Good flavours, just wish they weren't watered down by whatever was making the pizza so moist :("}
{"text":"Got gift certificate from a friend for here. Tried it and have to say wasn't that impressed. Should have some sort of sign to say order @ the counter before having a seat.

As for the pizza, I really like the pizza crust but that was about it. Sauce tasted like tomato juice. No spice what so ever and really watery. Had the ham & crushed pineapple. The ham was large thin slices, about 4-6 of them and globs of crushed pineapples. There wasn't enough cheese either. Wouldn't come back until they have a better sauce for the pizza.

Music was so loud I could have a conversation without yelling. Kinda gave me a headache being in there for 30 mins or so."}
{"text":"Old faithful.

Easy to order vegan options, even if the staff doesn't always know what's in their food (luckily most everything's made on site and the kitchen can confirm for them). Adding a napoli salad is a good way to cut the grease that results from drowning your pizza in chili oil (it's delicious, don't judge me).

I'm not always in the mood for thin crust pizza, but when I am Famoso really hits the spot. The old time-y counter service is great for weeknight \"I give up\" takeout without a whole lot of fuss.   

I find a dinner for two usually runs the Calgary average of $50 (without drinks)."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian style pizza I've had since being in Naples almost 10 years ago.  I'm as surprised as the next guy to have found it in a shopping mall location of all places.

I was with a large party of about 30, that staff kept the food coming, and the drinks full.  I tried 6 or 7 pizzas and they were all great."}
{"text":"I have been to all of there locations in Calgary and this is the worst of them all. I would recommend the one on 4th street downtown.  The reason I don't like this location is as follows.

1. It is in a family neighbourhood so there are lots if families with kids so the ordering system is chaotic.  It works at the other locations but not here.
2. The noise, I have never been to such a noisy place. The loud music doesn't help.
3. Each time I have been there it took forever to get our food and when you do get it they don't usually come back to check if it is good.
4. The last time I was there they took our order and we sat down and waited and waited watching everyone getting served who came after us.  I was finally able to flag down someone which is tough when no one is actually responsible for your order.  The went together kitchen and found out the where missing some of our toppings so they just didn't make it.  So we had to order again and instead of making our order a priority they put it at the end of the orders.  I know this because I watched.  I even went to the company website to let them know what happened and never heard back from them.

Do yourself a favour and go to a different location.  The food is great and service is great at the other locations."}
{"text":"The Pizza is really good and reminds us of Neapolitan pizza.  But the 2 stars is because the place needs a major cleaning.  The windows had tomato sauce on them and the glass doors look like someone wiped them with a wet napkin.  The place is looking very well worn and it's not that old."}
{"text":"If you love a traditional Naepolise Pizza, give Famoso a try! delicious and reliable every time for a great meal!"}
{"text":"So we tried out Famoso today as we all wanted some good pasta and pizza.  Those of us who had the pizza said it was ok and had good flavor despite being soggy looking.  I had the Pesto Pasta Primavera it was tasty but loaded with oil on the bottom and very few veggies considering its a vegetarian pasta I was not impressed and it looked nothing like the picture.  I know I won't go back for pasta but I'll try the pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Amazing Margarita pizza, so long as you ask for lots of basil, otherwise there will be literally four (4) small pieces only (not good!) Wines by the glass aren't big names, but have big taste and big flavour. Salad with blackberries, goat cheese and candied pecans is to die for, not unlike the gelato! No wonder this place is always lined-up out the door!!"}
{"text":"Went to Famoso, spent $11.75 and got a salad and small vegetarian pizza, which was just the right size to fill me up. One of the best pizzas I've ever had, and affordable too. Gelato was only so-so, but that doesn't take away from the quality of this resturaunt. Atsmosphere and waitstaff were also very good. This includes the music selection, which I was tapping my feet to.

Will go again, and again.

Btw, the person who labeled this as $$$ (aka, spendy) is wrong."}
{"text":"Great Pizza but Terrible Phone Answering!

Delicious pizza that isn't greasy and you even want to eat the crust.

Only problem is trying to call to make a take-out order.

We tried for a solid 30min before we gave up and just went down. They're VERY fast but we noticed so many people standing around when we got there I can't understand why the phones weren't answered."}
{"text":"I like Famoso. 

I heard of amazing things about Famoso from my Vegan friend. So my fiance and i decided to try it out! 

First impression like another reviewer below was that we weren't sure what to do. There should be some kind of sign to give customer instructions on what to do; which i think would be a lot more efficient than the servers repeating themselves all the time and customers just wobbling around like me not sure what to do.  I heard of long lineups but i guess we were lucky because we got a table rather quickly. 

Anyways we ordered and first experience is kind of cool watching the people behind the glass panels make our pizzas. 

We ordered the San Andreas pizza and another pizza that i didn't care much for which is probably why i forgot the name. But the San Andreas pizza was sooo good! I loved the avocados and tomatoes and the olive oil. Yum! It's too bad they only had it for summer season. 

We went back again just for that pizza only to find out they had a different pizza for Winter which is the Pear Gorgonzola. So we tried the Pear Gorgonzola and i didn't like it one bit. It tasted quite bitter IMO with the Pine nuts and the spinach leaves. 

We've only been to Famoso twice and ordered two pizzas for both of us because we wanted to try the different varieties. Two pizzas was too much for us and we always end up having extras to take home. 

They have Italian sodas there too. I'm going to try that next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and great atmosphere I will deffo be a return!! Tomato sauce is amazing and you can buy take home jars!!!"}
{"text":"Specialty pizza and drinks are good, but the service is mediocre at best. Everything takes a long time to come and we waited an excessively long time for dessert in a half empty restaurant."}
{"text":"Very very bad. Had the mozza balls to start, crazy salty and just bad. Ordered a pizza and it was probably the worst pizza I've had this year, soggy, flavorless, just not good at all.

If you like good pizza go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Best pizza we had in Calgary, we tried 3 different types all yummy, gelato is good, they have different ordering system where you write your order and handed over to  chef, will go there always when we dream of pizza"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful, from start to finish! Authentic, neapolitan pizza with the most amazing sauces and freshest toppings. This is pizza you cannot feel guilty eating because of the quality toppings and freshest cheese. The salads are equally as amazing, but make sure that you save room for dessert as a trip to Famoso wouldn't be the same without it! 

I highly recommend going with a group so you can indulge in as many flavours as you can, with a fresh italian soda on the side!"}
{"text":"You need to go! Fantastic pizza, great decor, friendly staff but busy as hell on a Friday or Saturday night. You'll wait 45+ minutes but it's worth it if you ask me. 

If you want something unusual, I highly recommend the Szechuan pizza with a side of Gorgonzola salad and end it off with the tiramisu. So good your boyfriend won't even share.... won't he? 

I will forewarn so that people don't get all weepy: It is half waiter-service and half fast-food-ordering. You order at the front when you're ready and you pre-pay but the servers will take care of the rest for you. It works. 

Great wine selection too! It's an amazing pizza gem!"}
{"text":"Three words:
Cold pizza soup
Maybe it's just me, but I don't like cold runny pizza that complete falls apart when I pick it up"}
{"text":"Wow.  Where to start.  This was one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant.  Normally I don't write up a review for a mediocre experience but this just stood out as exceptionally mediocre.  

Let's start with a list:
1 - visited on a non busy Sunday evening and decided to go with the mimosa special.  We were told that they don't have mimosas.  There is a sign in front of the restaurant advertising their mimosa special at $1 off. (This turned out to be lie #1)
2 - we were told that bellinni's were on special (lie #2)
3 - after waiting quite some time for our bellinni's to appear we were told that \"they had broken all their Bellini glasses and we would have to wait while they washed some\". - lie #3
4 - we ordered the diavolo pizza.  We were told they didn't have the ingredients for it.  Really?  
5 - service was extraordinarily slow.  On several occasions we saw pizza waiting on the counter with no one really doing anything about it.  One of these instances was our pizza.
6 - we had cutlery for half the table.  It wasn't really all that clean.  We asked for some and got some after several minutes.
7 - pizza was okay
8 - had to constantly hunt down the waitress in order to a) order b) provide cutlery c) provide the kids meal dessert d) provide the bill e) correct the bill
9 - bill arrives after we ask for it and lo and behold the bellinni's aren't on special.  We ask for a correction.  The waitress seems surprised that we expected a special on the bellinni's as communicated earlier by the same waitress (hitherto we shall refer to her as the liar).  The liar says she will get the bill fixed.
10 - after quite some time the liar comes back and says she needs a manager discount and that the manager will come talk to us (okay no reason to but whatever)
11 - after continuing to wait (while watching pizzas sit on the counter) the liar finally comes back with a discount (larger than expected) and says that the discount should have been applied automatically (lie #4).  We pay and leave.

I really don't know what to think.  Did we just have a pathological liar who tells lies to cover slow service and a disorganized restaurant?  I mean who doesn't have clean glasses for a half empty restaurant?  Why offer bellinni's on special if they aren't? (Because they are $4 more each and if you don't watch the bill and ask about it they get the benefit). Or is the place simply poorly managed and can't keep ingredients in stock or train their servers?  Regardless, there are better places to eat in the extreme NW."}
{"text":"Do you ever get so excited to catch up with friends and devour amazing food that you forget to take photos? That happened to me here. (BTW - sorry not sorry!)

I am in love with their white sangria, it's light and so refreshing! A fun twist on a childhood beverage - apple juice with Grand Mariner and lime soda.

Being that the pizzas are thin crust, there are no regrets being able to finish two pies - one being the formaggi with prosciutto and the other a spicy salami. 

And you can't forget about dessert - the vanilla bean gelato is the perfect way to finish off a great meal.

Highly recommend Famoso!"}
{"text":"Not quit Naples but good enough to keep coming back every now and then. The ordering system is a little goofy.  Would probably go there more if I could just sit down and order rather than wait to order then find a seat. But all in all really satisfying pizza."}
{"text":"Delicious thin crust pizza. Unusual way to order - have to go up to the bar, even for drinks... but not that big of a deal."}
{"text":"This whole chain has had a significant decrease in quality of food and service. Used to order once a week but then service declined so bad and quality of pizza went downhill. 4 separate times I called to order pick up and the chick who answered forgot I was on hold. Last time I tried to order I asked to add somthing to a pizza and was told the kitchen is too busy to take requests.... So I'm the one paying here I get to make a request. It was a simple request to not slice up the spicy sausage and use the bigger slices that they used to do. Which they had no problem doing previously. We cancelled the order and never went back."}
{"text":"I like the decor, open feeling and music. Unfortunately I did not care for the salty pizza...."}
{"text":"I'm probably the person that eats more pizza than anybody else in Alberta and I must say it was a great pizza once , but they've gone downhill I was there yesterday night and it was rubbery and  tasted really really bad but hope they get better soon their prices are still very low and that's probably why they're probably not using the same ingredients to cut cost."}
{"text":"Gross.  Just plain ridiculous slop.  Who works the kitchen ? Drunks? Guy you found in the alley?  Obviously can't cook to save they're life. Gross pizza nasty greasy garbage balls . Almost made me puke ."}
{"text":"Ahhh, this is my go-to place for a casual meal out. The service is always good, and the one time we had to wait an abnormally long time the server comped our appetizers. The pizzas are fantastic, great combinations of ingredients and they are always fresh and screaming hot when they arrive at the table. My absolute favorite pizza is the Capricciosa - thin crust with a white sauce base, shaved brussel sprouts (trust me it is delish!), chopped dates for some sweetness and gorgonzola cheese. Yumm!

They have fantastic lunch specials that are really reasonably priced. I would highly recommend their ceasar salad or roasted tomato bisque paired with a personal size of your favorite pizza. 

If you haven't been to Famoso's yet, I would highly recommend you try it for your next casual meal. And don't forget about their authentic gelato selection, have a couple taste samples on your way out if you are too full to order a scoop!"}
{"text":"Famoso is fast, fresh and friendly with fabulously good, authentically Italian fair that sometimes makes me say \"holy eff!\"

I have to give Famoso props for unique selection. They are, first and foremost, a pizza place; and the menu reflects this boasting a wide selection of pizzas and do-it-yourself combinations; however, they also serve a variety of delicious appetizers, salads and yummy gelato.

To be fair, I am not a giant fan of their pizza crust - it's a touch on the soft side for me and doesn't hold up well in the flavor department if the pizza isn't warm - so I tend to lean toward the salads and appetizer combinations. Namely the warm olives, flatbread, caprese salad and gelatos. But don't take my word for it, try the pizzas, the wine and anything else that tickles your fancy and we'll see if you feel as Italian as me when you're done eating.

Bellissimo!

{"text":"I visited Famoso today with my mom after wandering into Mission and wanting to try something different. I've heard a few good stories from friends who have visited and said they loved the pizza. I am always a fan of thin crust Italian style Neapolitan pizza, so I wanted to give this a shot to see how it fares in comparison to other Italian pizza places in Calgary.

My first impression of the restaurant was that it was very open, airy and modern. I enjoy the open style kitchen. However, the service was strange and slightly confusing at first. When I walked in the first thing I noticed was a menu board in front of the cash desk, so I figured that they want you to order and pay first. As I stood there looking at the menu the server said that we could sit down and that there were menus on the table. Okay then, I prefer that. Well, after sitting down the server came by our table to explain the process to us and said that once we have decided what we want to go back up to the counter to order. I don't understand the practicality of this at all, and it was pretty irritating to be honest. 

My mom and I ordered a small margherita pizza to share and as a side we chose two salads. I had the caprese salad to start. It came with large slices of mozzarella and tomato over top of a mixed salad and drizzled with balsamic dressing. It was decent enough, but what turned me off immediately was the pieces of black wilted salad which I had to pick out and set aside and it was the same issue in my mom's salad. The chef really should pay more attention to details like that because it's quite gross.

Once the pizza came I was happy with the small size. It was the perfect sharing size for a light lunch. However, I was not happy with the taste or the texture. The middle of the pizza was VERY soggy and quite drippy. I  have never had Neapolitan pizza that was soggy before so this was definitely not cool. I did like the crust though.

Overall, I would say Famoso is an average pizza joint. They really are not one of the best because I have had better thin crust pizzas in Calgary. Their service is lacking in a couple areas, and so I don't think I would make the effort to go back here again."}
{"text":"Love this place and so happy they have a location in the NW now! Yum!"}
{"text":"I really liked some things about Famoso, while other things weren't to my liking.

The prices at Famoso are better than some of their competitors (up to $4-$5 cheaper for comparable types/toppings).  I personally prefer a very crisp pizza crust, but Famoso seems to be going more for the flexibility of the \"fold your slice in half\" to eat kind of crust.  Some people may prefer this type of pizza.  I found that the toppings were plentiful, but that some (such as the tomato based sauce) were overly bland.

The service system was a little awkward.  I understood that you order at the till, which was totally fine, but there were also a plethora of servers (4+ different ones during our meal) who came by to see if we wanted more drinks or food.  Perhaps they are trying to provide great service, which I appreciate - but I kind of wish they'd choose a system and stick to it.  If there's going to be waiter service, one waiter would be better so that there's some continuity rather than random staff stopping at the table at random times.

Famoso is a decent pizza joint, but I'm not sure that I'll be back, given so many other options in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Just as I anticipated, Famoso on 4th knows how to make a delicious, AUTHENTIC Neapolitan pizza.. 

I finally had the chance to enjoy an evening here over the weekend to try some of the new spring/summer menu over a nice bottle of Pinot noir. The don Andreas and Funghi pizzas were fantastic. If you are a bonafide mushroom lover, you must try the Funghi pizza with truffle oil, parmesan and fior-di-latte.. I love avocado and chicken, so naturally, the don Andreas was a hit. Both pizzas were cooked thoroughly without charring the crust.

I somehow managed to save just enough room to sample the yummy Thai coconut gelato for dessert..

In summary, Famoso is wonderful, this location in particular. The service is warm and friendly as well, which I really appreciate. Best Neapolitan pizzeria I've tried in Calgary..  

Una pizza deliziosa!"}
{"text":"I made an order for pickup. I arrived when they said the order would be ready and was told it would be 4-5 more minutes. I sat at a table for 25 minutes without anyone giving me an update on what was going on. The server I spoke with made eye contact with me several times but didn't approach me. When I finally got the food there was no \"sorry for the wait\" or anything like that. As far as I knew, my food had just been sitting there the whole time and I had been forgotten about."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian pizza. We tried a few or them, the Thai chicken pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza, nice atmosphere and good coffee. The service was great. Interesting way to pay though 
1) write down what you want 
2) go to cash register to order
3)pay later
It was overall really fun!"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favourite new eating experiences in Calgary.  

A year ago this location was an awful cafe that was struggling to attract a single customer.  Twelve months later, it has been transformed into one of the hottest and most reasonably-priced restaurants in the entire city. 

Once you get a seat, the server doesn't start doing your job until you go up to the counter and order.  It is great because it means you are waiting for the server to get their act together.  You're ready to order, go do it yourself.  Ends up being a lot faster!

Every piece of food was delicious, warm, fresh and authentic.  
They also have a big community table, so if you don't mind bumping elbows with the stranger beside you, then you can usually get a seat faster.   But a great big table like this only adds to the atmosphere.  Eating food should be fun. It should be loud and it should be about sharing and that is exactly what Famoso is all about. 


(Take note, if you get there after 5:30pm, you'll be waiting.  And sadly, they don't take reservations.)"}
{"text":"I ate at Famoso last night as it is in my contract with yelp to eat out every night.
I was impressed.
Yes, the ordering style is a little wacky, having to order at the counter and then be served waiter style, but not exactly an inconvinience. We were seated right away, ordered a bottle of merlot and some garlic prawns. The Prawns were great and since we bought the wine we also got a free olive tapanade. 
The Pizza was a delicious, neopolitan style work of art. I wanted to plunge my face directly into it banana cream pie styles but my dermatologist recommended that I stop doin that.

Speaking of art though, check out the dope ass painting of pompeii and mount vesuvius over the kitchen area, 3 colors and its beautiful.

oh, did I mention that all of that came to $50, AFTER TIP! hoodie-hooooo


I give Famoso 5 severed horse heads out of 5"}
{"text":"I had a less then satisfactory experience at this location. They were too busy to serve within a reasonable time frame and provide the selection of ingredients they were suppose to offer. No compensation was made for the  poor service or lack of basic topping options. The other Calgary locations have been much better so I will stick with them.

Update: 
Oct. 2, 2015
I was recently contacted by the new manager of this location. It is good to know that they are under new management, so there is hope that they will improve. I am not motivated to return but I wish them well."}
{"text":"As pizza's go, this one is quite light and dare I say, healthy as pizza's from a chain go. 
The Gorgonzola Salad was very tasty as well, and even the small is enough food. 
It's an open noisy design, but in a good sort of way. Good location for families. 
I'll come back."}
{"text":"Although the ordering process is a little taxing (hence the 4/5 stars), there is no doubt about their food. So delicious! I've been here probably 8 times, and i can't stop coming back, it's so good! The prosciutto wrapped meatballs, amazing. All of their pizzas are superb, i can't choose just one. Overall, great place, never a long wait even though the entire restaurant is a little small, i will continue to go back again and again."}
{"text":"Al-rightie...
Let's see.
The thing about Pizza, lately, is it's heading towards the real, authentic, non-traditional10 pounder variety they make in most of the usual haunts in town.
The best of those, is still Spiro's on 17th Ave. S.W., in my books.
It's been there since I were a tadpole, and I'm a Big Ole' Bullfrog now, Baby.
Noticing how there was a lot of buzz and tingle about this place on here, myself and a lady chum hit it on a Friday night about 10 to 5.
Service, as mentioned was a bit quirky, you actually have to go up to the counter to order, but after that you're granted your very own 'server'.
The service then was prompt and friendly and the place had a really friendly vibe.
People bring their kids, but I never heard a single squawk... the place is bustlin' so much in such a short time, the little rodents were mesmerized.
They had beer and a good variety, and for desert we both screamed \"OINK!\" and had 3 scoops of Gelato each.
But I can tell, yer' just holding on by your fingernails waiting to hear about the pizza. Right?
OK.
I LOVED the whole experience at Famoso, it was pleasant as could be and about the only thing that didn't knock me over the back yard fence was...
You guessed it.
The PIZZA.
They were good...quite good,(*we ordered two different ones to split), but I found it really strange that they had them to the table in about 3 minutes.
Cooking thin crusts is an art, and here?
It wasn't QUITE happening.
I'd give the food a 7 and the experience a 9.5.
The place was so crazy by 6 that the washrooms are downstairs and there's even tables in the dungeon...those were packed too.
I've tried Una, and it's fantastic and a nice Italian market on 1st Street called Guiseppe's makes fantastic little pizzas that are thin as can be and oven baked. Thankfully it takes more than 3 minutes.
They're bursting with flavour but don't TELL anyone...
It's a well kept secret."}
{"text":"Used to think the food was good but has gone downhill.   Soup barely warm, doughy pizza undercooked.  Children's pasta had no taste.   Search is on for a new pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Not as good as I thought it would be.  The place is neat, but the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"A little disappointed.  I'm a pie fanatic....ate pizza everyday I was in Italy - always on a mission to find awesome pizza.  The flavor here is good, but what I had to take off on is on the crust!!!!!  Soggy middle?  C'mon....gotta get better than that.  I'm not sure what would need to be adjusted...the temp of the oven, position of the flames....dunno.  What I do know is that I've been to many pizza oven joints....wood-burning, brick-oven, etc (even one that brought their oven straight from Italy and took months to deliver by sea to get it authentic) and I've never had it soggy like this before....would love to try other places and would pass on this place...."}
{"text":"I always hear about Famoso, but to me it was more \"so-so\" than famous-o. The overall flavour was good. I ended up creating my own pizza, as each of the original recipes had an ingredient that I didn't want, or perhaps missing out on something that I did want. My other two memories include: 1) a challenging to chew crust, which I needed to clench down hard with my teeth and pull equally as hard to rip the dough apart, and 2) the charcoal bubbles erupting all over my pizza like pimples."}
{"text":"I have a not so secret love affair with Famoso. Fortunately my boyfriend feels the same!  It has become a regular haunt for us & I look forward to each visit.

Perhaps we have been lucky, but we have never had to wait more than 15 minutes to be seated here. We have even been given wine samples when we have waited (a great way to win this girl's heart!)

Some are confused by their ordering system, as indicated in other reviews.  On your first visit, if you listen carefully they'll explain it fully & from there it is a breeze and you'll know what to do on return visits.  I actually like this method as it ensures we eat when we are ready - our food is always served soon after we have placed our order.  Your server will take care of the rest. Promise.

Staff are always friendly & happy to answer questions. Always a nice little feature.

The pizza is amazing - flavors are not over powering, enjoying you to taste each ingredient as it is meant to be presented. The red sauces tastes like tomatoes! This is huge for a city where we tend to overload our sauce with seasoning. If you prefer something with a little more zip, ask for their salsa base instead.

I was going to offer my thoughts on a pizza by pizza basis, but when I looked at the menu I realized I have tried most of them. (Oops!) They were all most delicious.  Special nods to the Cavoletti (Fresh mozzarella, pecorino romano, oven-roasted Brussels sprouts, prosciutto crisps, gorgonzola cheese, drizzle of honey, sprinkle of dates and walnuts) & Vittoria (Vittoria has a fiery salsa base, topped with fresh mozzarella, oven-roasted spicy chorizo sausage, roasted chicken, pineapple, and basil.) Sounds odd to some, but they are fantastic.

DO. NOT. MISS. the Nutella pizza!  You will want to kiss the closest person to you once you sink your teeth into it.

Go hungry. Leave full. This is what life should be about!"}
{"text":"Famoso was known to be a great Trendy restaurant with some fantastic food and an overall well rounded experience. 

I would categorize us as regulars but our last few visits have consistently been disappointing.

Don't bother with their cocktails if your thirsty because they look like a child size drink with all ice. Can I have some liquid with that ice please? Two small sips and the drink is gone. Maybe they can't afford average size cocktail glasses.

Their pizza options have changed too. Some for better, some the same, and some just suck now. Like their Korean pizza... Way better before. Looks like they are cutting corners with the toppings to save costs.

Now, if you look at the costs compared to what you get, it's laughable. Salads are over priced, meat ball sandwich was terrible for the price, and the pizzas aren't worth the experience...may as well order out Pizza Hut and get more for the money.

Overall, top to bottom, the restaurant is going down hill.  

You get a 3 star just because I have faith it will turn around."}
{"text":"yes their pizzas are soggy.  it's not because they are any fresher than pizza from any other place, it's because they need to reduce the water in their sauce and veggies.  We went again last night, and when the pies were brought to our table, one of them literally had a pool of water standing in the center.  This should not be!  they could also bake them a bit longer since there is absolutely zero charring or browning on the bottom of the pizzas, and they could serve them on pizza screens instead of directly on ceramic plates which trap moisture.

don't get me wrong, they do use very high quality ingredients and this results in tasty pies, but the sogginess is a major flaw and they should really be working to improve that.  you should not be delivered a pizza with 1/4 cup of water in the middle of it."}
{"text":"Getting together for a girls night and we picked this place since it was  central to everyone living  in the deep NW.

When we arrived on a Tuesday night, it wasn't overly busy and most of the customers were families with kids. Which is good to  know since we were there at dinner time.

Although the ordering process is a little taxing and confusing if you are a \"newbie\" to this place (hence the 3.5 out of 5 stars), there is no doubt about their pizza. So delicious.

We wrote down everything we wanted and assigned one of the girls at our table to go place our order. Including drinks since no  one came by for our drink order? Maybe it confused someone that 4 adult woman don't drink when they are together? No idea but we needed drinks!!!!!

I always wonder if you are an adult solo with your kids, how this  would work? Especially for small kids since you can't leave them un-attended at a table to go order at the counter? Most likely I wouldn't come with my child solo to this place, because of that reason.

We ordered a Margareta and a Funghi pizza to all share. We also all ordered some marinated olives and Caprese salad. A couple glasses of wine and an Italian Greyhound (side note - this drink was so refreshing I had to have a few)

This is a good casual place to eat, no long wait for food and pricing is reasonable. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"We went for dinner tonight. Excellent food. Great customer service.  Manager and the server were very friendly."}
{"text":"I quite enjoy this place, though I doubt it ever gets slow here. Waiting for a table at times can take quite a while, but it's something I've never done when eating here, opting instead to do take-out.

Both time I've been here for food, the pizza has been fabulous. The first time we got their Sweet BBQ Chicken pizza and ate it outside on a park bench - it was incredibly good. 

The second time, we got the Sweet BBQ Chicken pizza and a Pear Gorgonzola pizza. Now, I don't know if they typically cut it and then put it in the box, but it seems they failed to cut all the way through the pizza. Fortunately we had taken it home, so we had knives to cut it with.

I would like to eat in here at some point - it feels very open as a result of numerous windows. It's an open-style kitchen, so if you are waiting for food to go you can watch them prep your food. It does seem fairly loud, so it's not somewhere I'd take someone whom I wanted to have a quiet conversation with."}
{"text":"Pizza was nice. Service was not good. 4 pizzas ordered. 3 came to table 1 person had to reorder. Food arrived 20 minutes after everyone else's. Drink order was wrong 3 times at a certain point you know it not going to get any better. I never ask for a discount for bad food or poor service .most places would recognize that they messed up and try to make it right with the customer. It's possible they didnt have a duty manager present. Any way the food was good. It's a nice restaurant . Staff need more training."}
{"text":"Famoso is a great pizza place in a great location. The restaurant itself is very cool, I *love* the circular shaped area with the gigantic glass walls/windows. Its a very well-designed place. 
The pizzas are Napolitean, which means they are on a thin crust and quite dainty. The menus have a LOT of variety, so whatever your mood, you will have a pizza to match that mood. They also have great espressos/cappuccinos/coffee.
Its a perfectly great place, and the service was pretty good too. No issues anywhere at all. So why the 3 stars? Well, the pizza just wasnt that tasty for me. But thats a personal opinion. My dining partner loved it and is raring to go back, but for me it just did not... deliver. (No pun intended there!)

I probably will go back to try their nutella pizza and their tiramisu which I've heard is heaven on a plate. And I will try a different pizza this time, and perhaps I will change my mind and fall in love :)"}
{"text":"easy 5 stars. who doesn't like pizza??? I mean come on... serving pizza to the public is very important and as someone who enjoys pizza I vote yes to pizza and recommend 5 stars."}
{"text":"What I like is that on Tuesdays you can buy a movie ticket from Famoso for $6 - and you can use it any night of the week at Cineplex. It's cheaper than buying it from Costco. I like how you order your pizza and then the pizza comes to you. One time I went here, they had a fundraiser for some speedskaters going to the Olympics, I thought that showed major initiative for supporting locals."}
{"text":"Walk-in stand at the door nobody will greet you .Staff will walk by you. 
Go up to the bar sit down and try to wave down somebody will give me a menu. Finally get your order in pizza comes out fantastic. Try to get your bill to pay to leave impossible.
Find out the from the girl who finally took our bill the guy who is serving this was a manager pathetic.

When we were walking out the door met up at the neighbors talk to them to days later they had the same exact experience.

Myself I'll never ever waste my time going in there again"}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm not usually that impressed by sit down Pizza places here in Calgary. So when I went to this place i was prepared to be disappointed. wow, what a shock. the pizza was excellent! gooey mozza, fresh fresh fresh tasting sauces, capicolla and soprosetta were actually the \"spicy\" they claimed to be. And the crust was awesome too! I couldn't believe how good it was. My only complaint, not enough choices!!"}
{"text":"LOVE IT! I'm a regular. I love the thin doughy pizza (The spicy Vesuvio is my fave), and the Famoso salad is now my all-time favourite salad. No joke. I've had it four times now. 

But that's not the best part! Top off the perfect meal with a couple scoops of gelato, or the dolce and banana (includes a scoop of gelato), or, if you're in need of a pick-me-up, have an affagato - a scoop of gelato topped with a shot of espresso."}
{"text":"I love coming here for the pizetta option with the tomato bisque. I think I might actually be going for the bisque! It's incredible. I also love the dolce and banana. Om nom! And the service is amazing!! Especially, Sara!"}
{"text":"Famoso is wonderful. This was my first visit, and it was such a happy one, that I'm already mentally planning all of my future trips :). 

Vegan cheese at no extra cost, delicious toppings, sensible portion sizes, a warm server that made our dining experience more enjoyable with his engaging personality; worth every minute of the 20 minute wait for a table! 

At Famoso, once seated, you go through the menu, write down what you want on a pad of paper and hand it off to the front counter. Wait time is reasonable, and the food arrives on a cutting board for sharing or being as greedy as you want. Since I was here with Sarah Louise, I got to experience the rare joy of being able to share food with a friend :). Yay, VEGAN SUPER POWERS. You have to try the Funghi Tartufo pizza, three different kinds of mushrooms and a drizzling of white truffle oil. Or Sarah Louise's choice: The Primavera, which included olives and artichoke hearts. Both were equally nomz.

It was so good that I was momentarily lamenting ordering the half size, until I realized that this meant I had room for dessert! Indecisive me had trouble deciding whether or not I wanted the Blueberry Basil sorbet, the Mango sorbet, or the Pineapple. Then I remembered that I'm a grown-up now, and this means I can have all of them if I want to. And I did! And our server gleefully set it down in front of me and made a \"SKIDOOSH\" noise when doing so. The flavors all together, was like eating a basket of summer garden goodness.

The only qualms I have were that when our drinks came, I asked for a glass of water that never showed up. I had to ask for it again when my second drink arrived. Also, when we went to pay our bill, the lady behind the counter wasn't really paying attention to what was going on. She let someone behind me pay first, even after I handed her our bill, and instead of handing me the debit machine, handed me a reprint. Our server apologized for her, though and charged us and sent us on our way. 

The thing that made me most at ease about Famoso? Going downstairs to where the bathrooms are located, and seeing one of the chefs eating the food. Always a good sign! They have a free wine tasting night every Wednesday, and Monday - Thursday, you can get a movie pass with your meal for $16."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food and service is always consistent. Do yourself a favour and order the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella balls for an appy. They are life changing!"}
{"text":"The pizzas i had were soggy and dough-y without much flavour. It tasted like poor quality fast food or frozen pizza."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time a few weeks ago and then I returned last week. The food is so good! I got the Italian Pepperoni and Mushroom the first time around and the Margherita the second time. Both times I was there in time for the lunch special, so I had the pizzetta versions (smaller size) with a side caesar salad. 

The caesar salad is not what you would expect: the dressing airs more on the side of a vinaigrette than a creamy dressing, the bacon is thin, like prosciutto, and the cheese is more chunky than on most caesar salads. It is so delicious! The flavours are very distinct from one another and they play together beautifully in the bowl.

The pizzas are also amazing! The crust almost tastes like a toasty naan bread; it's very chewy in the middle and has a great, buttery flavour. The sauce is a little bit more watery than what I usually find on pizzas, the cheese is fresh and not skimped on at all, and the toppings are clearly the best ingredients they can find. 

The pepperoni and mushroom pizza I had the first time had a great mushroom flavour that I loved, but, if you don't like mushrooms that flavour might put you off of the whole pizza, as the flavour melds with all of the other ingredients. The margherita had fresh basil on the top that just filled my mouth and nose with flavour and scent. It was mind-blowing!"}
{"text":"Pizza's tasted good but there was a lot of soot (burnt flour or something) on the bottom of the pizzas. Didn't realize until after we started eating. I will probably think twice before going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite during lunch break.   The name is a bit misleading, I thought I was walking into a pizza joint, nope, it's a pub/restaurant with a full menu.  The place was pretty busy for a lunch hour, the patio was packed full, a little over half the indoor tables were full. 

Regardless, the pizza was decent, not great, not bad.  Just average. 

Prices were higher than average, but not unreasonable. 

On my way out the door, the manager, possibly the owner apologized for the growing pains, saying it was busier than usual and that's why it was a bit on the slow side.  Big surprise to me, as I thought it took less time than average for a sit down, restaurant style place.  I was in and out in about 35 minutes.  I did notice they were a bit understaffed.  The staff that was in there definitely rose to the challenge, the only waitress on shift was pretty much in a full sprint everywhere she went.  The kitchen staff were moving with purpose.  Maybe with a little more time my pizza would have turned out better.  

I'll give them a try down the road again after the growing pains work themselves out."}
{"text":"5 stars!
This was our second time in and wanted to see how things were in comparison to the first time, around their Grand Opening.
Even better this time! We had fantastic service and I did not want my pizza to end, ever!
For lunch for around $20 per couple (lunch is until 4pm), you can get a personalized pizza each and a fresh, delicious salad to share. I love that there are several pizzas to choose from, not just a few for lunch. From the cripsy, chewy crust to the fresh ingredients to the tangy tomato sauce, everything was incredible. I think I stared at my last bite for a few minutes giving thanks!
We also got to try to gelato today for the first time. WOW! And we are generally not even dessert people! I recommend the salted caramel or the Nutella.
I almost got a pizza to go but Famoso... I will wait for you and be back as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here - we had tried before to get inside but the line-up was huge. Tonight, we had to wait at least 20 min in the corridor waiting for our name to be called and I was starving!!! (No reservations at all unless you are a group of 8 or more)  Once we were in, everything was a breeze. I had not seen this style of dining before - the server comes up to your numbered table with plates and cutlery and introduces him/herself. You then yourself have to order what you would like for food or drink at the front counter. Then your server comes back and he/she will then serve you the remainder of your meal, any other drinks, desserts etc. that yypu may like. Hmmm. We rolled with it. The food came out quickly. We each had an appy (soup or salad) and a half pizza which actually comes out as a personal sized one. (only $11!) VERY good, the crust was the BEST. That doughy, chewiness that is hard to find these days on a thin crust. We had Primavera and another one that was similar, just with ham on it, good quality toppings. 
The pizza oven here was imported from Italy - impressive! I had read reviews of this restaurant here on Yelp before we went out and I fell in love with a pic of the fire roasted tomato soup someone had posted. I asked the gal behind the counter taking our order if the soup was as good as it looked on-line and she said it was the best ever. She was right!!! It was served piping hot, seasoned perfectly, it was so fresh that I could just see the tomatoes roasting away in my mind! The other appy we ordered was a caesar salad and it was a good portion, very good. It was lightly sauced so that you did not get too full on it - you want to enjoy your pizza right? :) And it had a garlic pizza wedge! In the little display case at the till,sat a couple of Tiramisu desserts left - hubby's fave. We ordered quickly before we sat there and just got too full with time and it was a 10 out of 10 decision. This was THE BOMB! (and I am not a dessert person) Imported from Milan Italy, flash frozen I was told, this beautiful dessert is brought all the way here for us to enjoy. We almost bought more to take home but stopped ourselves. Make sure you get this dessert and get the whipped cream and chocolate on top when they offer it!
This may not make for fine dining, there is limited seating and you may have to wait but it is clear to me why people keep coming back here - the food is amazing. The service was fine too for what they have set up for service. Maybe ordering at the counter just keeps things flowing more smoothly. I am not sure. But, we will be back!!!!
2 meals, 1 glass of wine, 1 draft  beer, 1 dessert = $49.84 not inc. tip! Not bad!"}
{"text":"Was greeted right when we walked in and was seated immediately. 
Our waitress was super-friendly and attentive

We went Thursday night and they had $5 drinks deal; beer, berry and limoncello lemonade for $5 each. We ordered the berry and limoncello lemonade and we both enjoyed our drinks.

We ordered the Abruzzo pizza and the Diavola pizza. My friend and I both did not enjoy the crust of the neopolitan pizza, having a burnt taste to it.
I finished the pizza, leaving the crust out as the pizza itself had lots of toppings on it. 

The Pizzeria was spacious and had a cafe style-feel to it. In front of the restaurant they have quite a few selections of gelato flavours."}
{"text":"Really good pizza neopolitana in a casual dining environment. This place is a chain, but the quality is still very good."}
{"text":"We didn't get the best service, our drinks didn't show up and waitress came and asked us again later and brought them. The food was really good: hot, flavourful, and the pizza crusts were crisp."}
{"text":"Love the pizzas!
Love the service!
Love the ambiance!
Love the location because everyone at the table wins either by watching the street view out of the gigantic windows, or, enjoying the view of the kitchen brigade performing their pizza pizzaz.
Love the tiramisu!
Even love the chairs and couches - so comfy!

(Music was just a tad too loud but that's because we're in our 50's, but by the end of such a wonderful dining experience we were in the groove and didn't mind the music one iota!)

Cheers, and thanks for a great dinner. We look forward to your Vancouver franchise opening soon!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great of you like Neapolitan pizza. Nice and thin, well done. My favourite is the vesuvio (has a delicious kick to it - get it with mushrooms!), my friends love the Thai. 

Ah and for dessert.... I love that I'm able to get two desserts. You know drink and something to nibble on. The affagoto is always a hit (with salted caramel!!!) and the banana dessert - not sure what it's called but it's sooooo goooood. 

What I really enjoyed about this place was the service. They are definitely still new and a few kinks and late orders came in - but wasn't a big deal to us. The manager was very apologetic for a missed dessert - I appreciated the apology but he went above and beyond with a GC for our next visit. 

But, that's not all - though new and they were doing a terrific job with serving, what really made me like this place was how accommodating they were. We had a big group and then got a little bigger. The servers communicated excellently with us a I appreciate how fantastic they were with our big group. Thank you. The kind service was greatly appreciated - our larger than average group was having an extremely rough day.  

All in all, there's limited places to dine at in the NW. So, Famoso will be very busy! But it's totally worth going to. And - I just learned that they take reservations! A huge added bonus in my books!"}
{"text":"They make a mean pizza, and a good cocktail! I think they are a good first/second date place,  its freaking great and I enjoy my trips there.

My previous review was only 3 stars, but I was bitter and angry I guess? Their service and pizza improved since then"}
{"text":"Love it
Good pizza, good drinks
I would recommend this as a first date place because its got an excellent atmosphere and good food. Also not gonna smash that wallet."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza every time.  I noticed a few other reviewers mentioning the soggyness.  Yes true it comes out that way sometimes but only because it is so fresh.  The sauce might not be thick enough.  The restaurant should work on the consistancy of that.  What I don't like is the noise and ordering at the front (usually lined up) plus I have never really had great service the 4 times I've been."}
{"text":"I am fortunate to live in the Mission neighbourhood and have my share of great restaurants within walking distance. This little gem is one of them. Famoso consistently delivers a tasty good value meal for the buck. 
My other half and I often go here for the pizza and salad special. A pizza of your choice with a salad of your choice served on a cool wooden platter. I have found all of the salads to be very nice- the Caprese is simple yet delicious. The mozzarella, although I doubt is made onsite is creamy, and fresh tasting, ripe tomatoes, fresh basil and a nice balsamic complete this classic dish. The pizzas are thin, yet satisfying - the tomato sauce is bright and fresh, and the crust warm and fresh. There are a variety of pizzas and I can safely assume all are made with the care that mine have been. 
What makes this place the best is the service. Although you have to initially place your order at the counter, the friendly staff look after the rest with a genuinely kind approach -without a hint of pretention which can be so off putting at many Calgary restaurants. The location is great right at the intersection of 23rd and 4th with big wrap around windows, perfect for people watching. Amazing value too - a big lunch or dinner usually clocks under 20 bucks ( not including tip or alcohol). There is a very cool girl who works there - great hair, and great personality. She and all the other staff are always friendly and  \"real\".
Thanks Famoso! You are great."}
{"text":"A four! There is better out there, but this is good crust for Calgary! It all has to do with the oven and the flour right?! Cooked at 900° for like 90 seconds, this is how it's done in the old country apparently. It's at once crispy and soft... and full of gooey goodness!! 

The chili oil pizza is nice, as is the pepperoni, bacon and mush (they have their own fancy names for these). I love it with a good solid dose of Parmesan. The centre of the pizza can get soupy with this style of cooking, but I haven't really noticed that happening too much at this location. I've always had a nice experience coming here. 

The tiramisu is very nice (imported all the way from Italy!) They also serve a Nutella pizza, and that is a tasty, tasty treat... but man I wouldn't do that every day. But every now and then... well how can you live without it?"}
{"text":"I have wanted to try a Neapolitan pizza for some time now, and while Famoso provided me a good insight as to what Neapolitan pizza is about, I have to admit I wasn't too impressed.

There was a review below that commented on the odd serving style of Famoso.  Placing an order at the counter and having the food brought to you waiter-style was an odd experience for me and I can see how this might agitate people. Nonetheless, I didn't mind placing an order even though me and my friend were situated downstairs. We had a server check up on us from time to time and when I wanted to order a few more items such as dessert, I was afraid that I would have to haul my lazy rear end upstairs again, but our server was nice enough to put through our order for us. But when it came to the payment, we had to settle the score at the counter again. So overall it made for a very weird experience and for the rest of the night I obsessed how this economical this serving method was for Famoso.

What really brought this down to a 3 star is that I wasn't too impressed with their food. I would say the items were fairly priced compared to what you would normally pay at most pizza joints. I ordered the tapenade/bruschetta appetizer, the margherita w/ anchovies (Italian baguong as I call it), and this gelato /espresso dessert. The appetizer was OK, we only enjoyed the artichoke and cheese concoction but the bruschetta and tapenade was eaten with little reflection on how good it tasted. My pizza was somewhat disappointing. I did enjoy the thin oven-baked crust, but I found the sauce bland and the topping lacking as there were only a few leaves of basil which I'm sure wasn't an expensive ingredient. I did like the little salty bites of anchovies but overall the pizza lacked depth. The Affogato dessert was good and I predict it could be the next coffee drink to catch and Starbucks will soon offer some version of this dessert drink. Oh yeah there was this amazing italian beer I tried but forgot the name of :S

It think my rating reflects how I feel about Famoso. It really was OK. I can't refute it's novelty and denounce Neapolitan style pizza. I wouldn't scoff and argue if I went with a group that voted to eat at Famoso .But on the other hand, its hard for me to say I am a fan of this place and wouldn't go out of my away to visit this place, or randomly suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"Pretty good and interesting variety  of pizza and salads. Nice change from standard Pizza Hut chain pizzas.  And prices are quite reasonable. Staff are very attentive and friendly.  They look after allergies really well as they even offer daiya soy cheese as a substitute for regular cheese.  Thai pizza and chicken/ tomatoe are nice.  The funghi is good but gets a bit heavy after a while.  For the service and value gets them to 4 stars."}
{"text":"I am not sure why people rave...maybe we caught them on a bad night. The crusts on my family's pizzas were either soggy or black, or both. I understand how Neapolitan pizza is supposed to be cooked, but spots burned to a crisp and bitter are not palatable.

My sandwich, the only meat-free option, should have tasted good, had the vegetables been actually grilled or roasted...they tasted like they had been steamed or boiled instead. I would have rated this restaurant worse, were it not for the tomato bisque, which was absolutely exceptional."}
{"text":"Quick review on the service: AMAZING!

This is one of the few places where the owners and management \"get it\". For take out we ordered two salads, an appetizer, a pizza, and they forgot one salad. I called them and got given a $40 gift card to make up for the mistake. Another time I came for takeout and it took 15 extra minutes that I was quoted (they forgot one dish and made it while I waited) and I was given a $10 gift certificate. That is how service should be; Famoso is one restaurant that values people'e business.

We come here every week - it is hands down the best pizza in Calgary; reasonable prices on good wines, and a great atmosphere. The Prosciutto wrapped Mozza Balls are my favorite thing on the menu. Words don't describe them....try that dish!"}
{"text":"This is my kind of eatery. Wide open space with massive windows, open concept traditional Italian kitchen, affordable, tasty pizzas fresh from the clay oven and a great, relaxed yet upscale vibe. Not to mention gelato! Heck yes."}
{"text":"After I arrived Calgary International Airport (YYC) at around 12:30 and after going through Canada Customs and Immigration and getting my bag, my friend picked me up around 1 and it was lunch time (12 PM-ish in LA). The first place my friend took me to was to Famoso and it was great! I loved the decor, the cleanliness, the service and the food.

The decor was really nice and they used a lot of wood 

Very clean, and waitresses were constantly cleaning up

Service was excellent, our waitress kept checking in on us with a great smile and she noticed to refill my raspberry iced tea before I was completely done but about 10% there 

I ordered a the Prosciutto Arugula Pizza and that was excellent, it was a White Pizza and according to the menu, \"All PIZZA BIANCA WHITE PIZZAS are made with Bianca sauce (extra virgin olive oil, garlic, and oregano), fior-di-latte fresh mozzarella, fresh basil leaves, pecorino romano cheese.\" This sounded like a great option because : 1) I love arugula and 2) prosciutto was a nice salted meat meat that seemed like a great combo with arugula. The pizza was described on the menu as: \"Baked, then topped with arugula, prosciutto, and pecorino romano\". The pizza it was nice, crust was thin, flavorful and soft, arugula was fresh and prosciutto was not overly salty, thinly sliced and looked imported. The pizza itself altogether was not salty at all, but with the perfectly salted prosciutto and sprinkled pecorino romano, IT WAS AMAZING!  My buddy ordered the Pollo and it was described as: \"Fire-roasted chicken, roasted red pepper, artichoke hearts.\"
I was pretty tired from the long day of travel and lack of sleep since the previous day so I only finished 2 slices and that was pretty filling in itself  but my buddy finished his whole Pollo. Don't worry its Friday at 2:11 AM now and I am enjoying the rest of my Prosciutto Arugula Pizza and it is still bomb! Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I've always been happy with the food at Famoso - both dining in and take-away.  Their pizzas are great!  The meatball appetizer and sangria are both really good as well.

My only comment for improvement is that the service is a bit odd.  I don't understand the whole going to the bar to just order a drink, but you have a server to bring your drinks out and take your food order.  It's a bit of a process and I've never seen this in any other restaurant in the world."}
{"text":"All the pizza here is amazing.  Their YYC entry is especially the best i've tried and is now a menu item.  The service is amazing.  Overall I wish all restaurants were this well organized.  Excellent managment.  The spicy Venuzio is just the right amount of spicy.  The bbq chicken tastes wonderfully like bbq chicken!!  The price is pretty good for 4rth street as well."}
{"text":"Best pizza in YYC. Friendly staff, good prices. Reasons enough for me to come here every week."}
{"text":"I'm going to start this off by admitting Neapolitan pizza is my favorite in the whole world and I lived off the real thing in Napoli for a glorious period of time a few years ago and I have long since been a Famoso convert by other locations.  With 4th street closed during the flood (now open I hear) I went to red deer for my birthday to have Famoso because I was missing what I couldn't have... it's that kind of love affair!  

That being said I have huge expectations but I'm also hugely biased to like the food coming from here.... 

This location has been here for about a month now and I'll guiltily admit to having been in several times already now that they as so close to me (fyi woot!)  I have been holding off on reviews waiting for the food to come \"up to standard\" on a consistent basis because I didn't really want to slam the place for not being close enough to the real deal when I could see the evolution and knew head office was there running a tight ship as everyone was training like crazy.

At this point,  food is coming out \"up to standard\" but there is some wavering in the consistency.   I'm extremely picky about a Neopolitan pizza (particularly a Margherita which is my typical order).   At some point they weren't saucing enough,  they were over cheesing and over cooking the crusts.   Now the toppings are right but about 20% of the crusts are coming out over done.   This is NOT to say it's a bad pizza... they look like beautiful crust for any other kind of pizza but it's too crisp for a Neapolitan pizza.   I thought I was going places when I explained it to one culinary manager only to be served an very over done for this style of pizza but a different culinary manager the next trip that shouldn't have let it out of the kitchen at all.  Sigh.   I have hope for you oh loved Famoso so I'm rounding up to a full 5 stars with hopes you'll grow into it more fully.

Moving on.... 

Although Pulcinella is Calgary's only member of Associazione Verace Pizza napoletana (aka AVPN or A society designed to maintain authenticity of Neopolitan pizza) I still prefer Famoso for the authenticity,  they are superior on the service and they come in a little lower in price point (although since Famoso's new menu has come out, pricing is closer).   They don't has as many elaborate non-pizza items as Pulcinella though.   I have learned that Famoso founders are AVPN trained but I feel the franchising nature of the business model made official certification a bit of a liability to potential owners.   I choose not to hold the certification process against them,  I can tell they are keeping things very traditional and sparing a few new pizza people,  things come out like I'd expect to find at the better Napoli pizza places. 

I'm partial to plain ol' Margherita which is mostly flavored with the sauce. Famoso's sauce is imported canned tomatoes with some added sea salt - that's it... and it's amazing!  Can you imagine a tomato so tasty you don't have to jazz it up with a ton of seasoning to be so good you can eat a bowl?   We've don't often have these mythical tomatoes in Calgary... save from the odd garden harvest or an amazing farmers market find.  Several years ago I might have thought that sounded crazy... but now I love to hold the cheese and the other toppings and allow the flavor of VERY simple and quality ingredients shine through. 

I've tried some of the other offerings through several changing menus and I've never really been blown away.  I haven't liked any of the white sauces (too oily) and adding too many other flavors really perverted my favorite part of the pizza itself.   Even in Napoli proper I only ever added a single topping like mushrooms to the standard margherita and that was only for some mild variety in the same ol' day in and day out. 

For a starter I like the trio but I find it very salty on the palate (the olives) so I don't like too much.  

For dessert,  I love the nutella pizza or the gelato - both found memories of Naples.   The gelato is from Fiasco Gelato which is delicious and some of the better i've had outside italy.  My favorite if I have an appetite is the nutella pizza though.   The large is better than the smaller because of the crust to filling ratio but it just kills me you can't get a large nutella hold the bananas in the large form anymore.  Not to get me wrong,  the bananas have an amazing profile with the dish but I can't help but make a horrible mess with bananas smothered in nutella sliding this way and that as I try to eat.  I don't like leaving the table looking like a 3 year old on spaghetti night. 

Service is usually good.  The new staff has some learning curves but the management is GREAT.  food is out fast and they will go way above and beyond to make you happy.  Waits are getting longer - darn the positive reputation!  Oh and movie tix are $6 on tues ($8 other days) with pie purchase - score!  It's amazing and I love it but please don't go!?!  Ugh, fine - I'll share."}
{"text":"I've been to Napoli in Italy and although it's a rather scary city to visit the thing that stood out was the food (mostly the pizza).  I have day dreams of the delicious pies I ate there and someday going back and eating them again - ha!  Why am I telling you this?  Well... because these are Napoli inspired... the tomatoes and cheese are imported from there... and OMG is that effort worth it.  They skimp on cheese in Napoli because the bread and the tomatoes have such robust flavor and it doesn't need to be slathered with cheese.   I'd say they are about 95% as good as Napoli pizzas...  which is well worth saving the $1000 air fare and 3 hour train ride from Rome.  4th street in Mission is also a lot more trendy and less sketchy than the back alleys in Napoli you must stroll to find the best food.   I've never found comparable pizza outside of Napoli (which is my favorite pizza of all time)... until now. 

I had never heard of them until recently (I don't really hang out in mission) but now they will need a restraining order to keep me away ;)

EDIT:  March '12.  

I've tried some of the other varieties but when I go I'm the happiest with the plain old Margarita pizza.   Some of their other kinda don't knock my socks off... but it's the Margarita specifically that is divine and reminds me of my days in southern Italia.   I love going in the week and getting their dinner and a movie deal.   $16 for my favorite pizza and a cineplex admit one pass - can you say woot!

Their newest wine list makes me sad - I've cycled through their new non-reserve reds with no interest!  Ack!

Things to try:

nutella and banana dessert pizza - messy but delicious!
tiramisu  - dare I say better than some from Italy?  
gelato -  from Fiasco which I remember from kensington (gone i think) and uses quality ingredients."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of pizzas however their crusts are on the thin side. So thin that the center is transparent....like having a big hole in your pizza. 

Their ordering sytem is a little strange, you have to go up to the til to place an order as their servers won't take your order from the table. This goes for everything on their menu. 

If you are looking for thin crust pizza, this is a good choice given that it is a lot more reasonably priced than places like UNA who charges way too much $$ and has a more limited selection."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty decent. What I really like about it is how open it is. It's a big room with loads of natural light. Great place to meet with friends or plan a small party. Check out the huge volcano painting on the wall above the kitchen. Epic."}
{"text":"First time at any Fomoso location and we enjoyed it. The food was great. Wednesday was $10 off bottles of wine. And they cork it and send it home with you if you don't finish it. Service was good. Right close to the movie theatre so I will def be back for eats before a movie sometime. Not a super happening place but if the food and service remain good, it will do well.

Updating to 4 stars. I've had take out twice since my first visit. Super easy to order and ready in 20-30 min for pick up. Meatball sandwich and side salad for $14! Deeeeelish"}
{"text":"I made my first visit during #YYCPizzaWeek. Wow - the Patate Pancetta Pizza is simply the best pizza ever! I really hope they add it to the menu. I wanted to order an extra to take home!"}
{"text":"Very average service at best. Very disappointed with the pizza. Soggy and absolutely tasteless. 
I will never go back to this place even if they paid for my meal."}
{"text":"Famoso is one of the best pizza joints in the area. The food is great, it makes good quality thin crust pizza and the food comes quickly. The service is a little strange--that is you have to go to the bar to order your drink, but the server comes out to take and bring the rest of your order.

My only other comment is Famoso pizza isn't the best to take out. The thin crust means the pizza can get very soggy very quickly. If you're going to order Famoso, I recommend eating in."}
{"text":"Casual dining and a nice night out in Mission.  The neopolatin style pizza is light and fresh with ingredients that are so full of flavor.  The service is a little different in that you order at the counter and then it's table service from there.  The choices on the menu are varied with lots of options for toppings but my favorite is the magherita for the fresh basil."}
{"text":"My Wife & I hadn't been to Famoso in a while, it's been a few years, back to pre-vegan days. We'd heard that their pizzas are made from Vegan dough, and there is the option of choosing Daiya Vegan cheese, so we decided to stop by for a quick meal.
Overall it was a nice experience. The servers were polite & attentive, and quick to explain the ordering procedures (Which was necessary, as the menu didn't seem all that \"user-friendly\" to me). They were knowledgeable as it related to the vegan options, which was very welcoming. The place has a modern, hip kind of vibe to it, but it was full of people of all kinds - a group of oldies & a family with little children evened out the hipster ratio considerably. We opted for a create your own pizza - the Margherita pizza was our base, and we added Roasted Red Peppers, Spinach, Red Onion, Basil & Garlic. The pie was brought to our table quickly, and it tasted fantastic. Not quite $18 fantastic, but quite tasty nonetheless. We'll be back for sure, but may choose less add-ons next time so that the experience is more affordable."}
{"text":"I'm midway through the meal but I can write the review now... AWESOME!  I'm already a fan of Famoso in Mission and Mackenzie Town, but everything I've had tonight is prepared perfectly.  Flatbread (pizza crust) was excellent, especially with a super tasty house made hummus and tzatziki for dipping.  My usual is spicy Thai pizza and it was even better than the previous dozen times.  Just waiting for the Nutella dessert pizza and I already know it will be heaven.  The staff is attentive and friendly, the decor is classy and inviting.  It will be a big hit here in the northwest."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and enjoyed the food generally. As a whole, I found this location often plays really loud music. It made chatting difficult. My friend really enjoys their sorbet options and the selections are many. The servers in general are helpful, and often attentive. Occasionally, I found some of them would forget to bring me a plate or fill my water. 

The pizza, often comes out partially burned. It was explained to me that it's normal. However, it's definitely not of my personal preference. 

Their salad I found taste better than the pizza. The anti pasto platter came with delicious green and olives that are not overly salty. The  prosciutto wrapped mozza balls were on special for $2/ball. It came with delicious tomato sauce and flatbread. First taste, it was amazing. Second taste, I found it slightly too salty for me to continue."}
{"text":"Have been here few times already; service is good, cannot say outstanding; food quality is the same every time; we tried different types of pizzas and all were fresh, tasting good. Not many options for beer on tap but works fine. Very close to Cineplex and easy to drop by in between movies.
Will be back definitely."}
{"text":"Thin-crust pizzas, check. Bustling interior, check. Trendy neighbourhood, check. We tried it one evening mid-week to avoid the insane lineups, and it was...ok. Friendly service, but I found the thin crust at a certain obscurely-located restaurant not too far from Chinook Centre better overall. Famoso is great for people-watching, though, if you're into that sort of thing, and they have a community table on the north side of the main floor (I didn't check downstairs)."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. 1st the pizza was not cut and we had to basically tear the pieces apart. Next the pizza itself was horrible. It was literally bread with a few pieces of arugula, 3 small slices of prosciutto and a few crumbles of Parmesan. It was basically bread and nothing else for over 30 dollars for one pizza. I'm stunned and wish I had my money back."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love pizza, especially when it's done right and Famoso knows how to blow your mind. 

From the instant we walked into the McKenzie Towne location we were treated amazingly well. The restaurant was bright, clean and comfy. You immediately felt like you belonged. 

Our late lunch consisted of two pizzas (there was no way in hell I was sharing mine) Me, the Abruzzo & hubby the Siciliana. And the taste? Put me in a gondola because I was floating down a river of happiness; and I could rave for hours about the sauce, it was the best that I ever tasted.

All in all; I don't think I'll ever want pizza from anywhere else unless I'm in Italy. Our experience at Famoso was perfect, and I can't wait to go back.

Seriously, if you haven't eaten at this place,  do yourself a favour and go. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"We had wanted to eat here for quite some time. Several people had told us how incredible the food was.
4 of us shared an appetizer and had 3 different pizzas.2 of them were burned and $11 for 3 bacon wrapped cheese balls didnt feel like good value.
The bill was nearly $100 and as bad as I wanted to like it, I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriends family took me there a weekend ago. Now I am sure that everyone has seen Neopolitan pizza on the Food Network. The super thin pizza, where you either have to fold the slice in half or risk having everything drop onto your plate.

I have never had neoplitan pizza before, but Famoso convinced that that is the kind of pizza that everyone should be eating. Not only was it super fresh but their hard-working staff ensure that each pizza that comes out of their oven is close to perfection. 

I tried 3 different kinds of pizza's. And each one of them had its own little twist to it. One cool thing was that the cheese pizza came with a slice of lemon...which added the extra kick. At least for me.

To be honest if you are feeling like pizza and want to try something that is hand made, original and TOTALLY not your average slice of pizza. Then go to FAMOSO."}
{"text":"Famoso has really good authentic napoleon pizza.
Also, get the gelato. Always new gelato flavors, and so far I've enjoyed them all. Nutella, Stracciatella, Blood Orange, to name a few.
My fave was a seasonal limited time flavor... some kind of wine, Cabernet I think?

There is even an option to order a pitcher of a cocktail which is how I celebrated my birthday!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat with the family. Kids enjoy the kids meal because of the Gelato that comes with it...but they leave still hungry because the kids pizzas are made for smaller children.  

TIP: If two or more kids, it's cheaper and more filling for the kids if you order a regular sized pizza. Otherwise you'll feed them at home again ;)

Today is the first day they have started to take orders at the table instead of ordering at the front. It's a convenient change but still didn't mind the old way too."}
{"text":"Gluten free prosciutto arugula pizza that doesn't taste gluten free....Nuff said. 
However, i wish they'd cut the pizza a little better. It's never quite cut through. My significant other has the same issue with the non gluten free crust, so it's not just harder to cut the gluten free crust."}
{"text":"I think this is the year of the pizza for us...with all the fabulous pizza joints opening up around town we are finding experimentation with pizza's currently high on our list of wants.  Plus the kidlets LOVE pizza.

Tonight's visit to Famoso really exceeded any and all expectations we had going in.  The customer service was exceptional.  Since there was a short wait, and our kids do not do well waiting we were offered seating in the downstairs part of the restaurant.  I went to check it out first and was quite surprised.  Quaint, bright, surrounded by oodles of wine bottles and the food network playing on the tv (lol).   While it wasn't as bright as upstairs, it also wasn't as noisy.  We also had a waitress take our order opposed to upstairs where you have to take your order to the counter, yourself.  So win win and a good start to our Famoso experience.

The pizza's were a decent price and they also offered kid sized pizza's. 

I've had pizza in Italy and the pizza we had tonight was very much like my Italian experience.  After sharing a Caesar salad with hubs, I had the prosciutto/arugula pizza (hubs had all meat) and the kids were simpletons ordering both a cheese & a pepperoni pizza.  All the food came quick and our hostess & waitress both went out of their way with their service.  We enjoyed everything so much we ordered dessert (a rarity for us). I had the salted caramel gelato, the kids each received gelato as part of their meal and just to be different hubs had the tiramisu (he said it was good but mine was better - lol). 

This is most definitely a family friendly place and they certainly cater to the kids...(kids were given special drink cups and allowed to take them home n/c).  Even the darn coffee was good.

I can't find any cons about Famoso's.  Both hubs and I were very impressed with everything, my young boy advised \"he liked it down here\" and my daughter indicated \"this place rocks\".  

Famoso's gets high marks in our books and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love the space - very funky, cool interior.  Pizza was good - including vegan cheese - and massive.  The service was ok.  As others have mentioned, the whole order at the counter and get some table service scenario was a little complicated.  The servers were fine, but not spectacular.  All in all, a decent experience."}
{"text":"Best Neapolitan pizza in Calgary.  Famoso has been imported from Edmonton and I was so glad to see it appear in Mission.

This place is all about the pizza - flat crust, interesting topping combos, and fresh ingredients.

It can be overrun and understaffed at lunch time, but you can still get a table, eat, and be out in less than 1 hour, usually with extra pizza to go.

Bottom line- Famoso makes great pizza. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So the first thing people should know about this restaurant is that it is not very wheelchair friendly unless the bank next door is closed.  Most of the sidewalk access to the front door is right beside a drive-thru lane for the bank.  And on the other side - sidewalk access is blocked by the glass barriers of their outside patio.  There is no way into the restaurant from the handicap parking stalls to the front door without wheeling yourself through a lane that could have traffic.

The pizza was not very hot nor was it flavorful.  One of the pizzas we ordered was supposed to have fresh basil on it but there was not quite one half basil leaf per slice.  The other pizza was supposed to have roasted mushrooms but there was a scant quantity.

Service was very poor as well.  There were no interesting explanations of the menu or suggestions on what to order offered.  I ordered a glass of water and a beer.  Apparently I was only allowed one of each because no refills of water or second beer offer was made.  We finished one of our pizzas before the other because it was slightly more edible than the other.  And the taking away of empty pizza plates and empty glasses was only done at the end of our meal.  Unfortunately it looks like the cooking impaired yuppies of Springbank may keep this place a float - I will not be back though."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in the amazing smell of great pizza and pasta hit us. Food was great. Out 1yr old enjoyed the pizza dough they gave her to play with."}
{"text":"Delish delish delish!

Ok, right off the bat I wasn't impressed by the fact that it's a \"order at the counter\" type of joint, it really takes out of the dining experience. On a -30C night, having to park really far down the street because they do not have their own lot really irked me. However, once the food came, I knew it was going to be totally insignificant to my future visits. 

All the ingredients are just SOOOO fresh. All the textures, tastes, colors, presentation were bang on, there was nothing that could have been better. Best part - Wednesday night wine sampler night, free sample wines! The pizza was evenly baked, no soggy bits or burnt patches like some other places. We (I guess that means more like \"I\") finished off with the Tiramisu, which was a bit heavier than I had expected, but it was just ok. I have heard great things abou the nutella pizza dessert though, which I will have to try.

The decor and dining area is elegant, simple and easy on the eyes. Dim lighting, jazzy neofunk dining music buzzing in the background, easily makes this a great date spot."}
{"text":"Famoso is not your typical Canadian pizza joint.  Seriously.  As the name suggests, it's a Neapolitan pizzeria.  Be prepared for pizza unlike what you're used to (unless you usually eat Italian style pizza).

What's different?  Well, the crust first off.  Pizza at Famoso follows the traditional thin crusted Italian pizzas and is cooked in a fire oven at 900 degrees Fahrenheit (or about 480 degrees Celsius - the same temperature at which a faint red glow persists as lava from a volcano is cooling off).  The dough is hand stretched and cooked in about 90 seconds on a circulating platform inside the fire oven.  How do I know?  It's an open kitchen, and you can see the kitchen staff tossing the dough up in the air as they prepare it and the pizzas going round and round inside the oven at the back of the kitchen.

Next difference is in toppings.  Typical Italian style pizza isn't your greasy pepperoni and mushroom, or BBQ chicken pizza.  Common (and yummy) flavours include: Margherita (fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil), Cappricciosa (fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, olives, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and Italian ham), and Siciliana (fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, Italian sausage, Italian ham and baked prosciutto).  Famoso does offer a variety of \"new world\" pizzas if your taste buds fancy those more.

If you're visiting soon, be prepared for a wait.  We arrived at 6:30 and waited about an hour before we got in.  But once you're seated, things roll fairly quickly.  There are menus at every table and once you've decided what you want, it's up to you to make your way upto the front counter and place your order for food and drink.  Even with it as busy as it was, our appetizers and our pizzas arrived in a very timely manner... hot and fresh out of the oven.

One last tip: The pizzas are meant to be folded like a book in order to be eaten (due to the thin crust).  But if you've got a pizza loaded with toppings (like I did with the Conforto - fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, roasted red peppers, mushrooms and Italian sausage), opt for eating with a knife and fork."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some friends and two toddlers and it was great. Staff was very friendly and the they offer free scoops of gelato for kids! The restaurant had a lot of space and the decor was simple but modern. The main focal point is their beautiful oven.  

The service was great and the pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"The high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows make for a great space and atmosphere.  However, it also echoes like crazy and when there are A LOT of ppl, it gets loud!

Pizza's were just  meh... one of the pizzas we ordered was totally soggy for a large portion of the pizza, and others were not super crispy.

They seat you, you look at the menu, you get up and order at the till, and they bring you your food.

---------------
 BUT....5 Stars for the TIRAMISU!!!!

It was AWESOME!!!!  Light, creamy, smooth, and delicious.  Imported from Milan!!!! Great desert to share!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice. Once with gf's for dinner and once with hubby for date night so here's both my reviews. 

Girls night- arrived at 5pm and had a lovely server who explained everything since it was my first time. I informed her of my lactose  issue and she made sure I knew exactly what was in the sauce and on the pizza by checking with the kitchen without my prompting to gauge my intolerance level. I ordered a seasonal pizza which was fantastic! Do note that she checked on us once before food arrival and twice after the pizzas came. I noticed that other reviews were only so-so but the service was great and pizza is a personal preference. If you like a crepe thin, slightly chewy crust with good quality toppings, go here. If you seek a thicker, crunchier crust with loads of cheese covered toppings, this is not it!  As a foodie, know what you are getting and judge based on fair criteria. I don't go to Moxies to get mad there's only 2 seafood choices then offer a poor rating! That is unfair to the resto. 

Date night- hubby and I stopped in at 8pm. It was his 1st time and he had the spicy soppresata. He loved the thin crust and that it had heat- totally spicy the way he likes! He's often disappointed by places that make a spicy claim but offer no kick. I had a Brussel sprout, date, walnut with honey drizzle pizza. Sounded weird but intriguing - loved it!!! Service again was really good, drink refills, and checking in on us. Overall, a very good experience both times! Keep up the consistency for repeat clientele."}
{"text":"We went here last weekend for the first time. It's casual, you order at the counter. Make no mistake though,it's great gourmet pizza and wine. Try the primavera, it has the best olives on it! We also had the tomato bisque and prosciutto wrapped mozzarella balls....yum!  Oh and the rustic garlic toast was delicious!  I wish I had room for dessert! Next time!

The only negative was the slow service for getting our 2nd course.  In their defence it got very busy so I'm sure the oven could only churn out so many pizzas at one time!

We'll go back this weekend again!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and we had a very nice time. We got soup, pizzas, and ended with Nutella pizza (on the house dessert for birthdays). 

Honestly I wish I could give this place a higher rating but the food is only so-so I think. The pizza dough always feels a little under cooked and somehow also manages to be a little burnt. The toppings are also pretty sparse. The margarita pizza was especially sad looking. My favourite pizza I've had is the mushroom but I think it still pales in comparison to the one at UNA. 

Service is super nice though and their drinks are also not bad. I had a lemoncello and it was pretty delicious - even for being a double! 

They're also good for big groups and take reservations so honestly I would probably still come back just for good times, but not really for pizza."}
{"text":"Very recently, I was propositioned with the profound question, 

\"If you had to eat pizza every meal for the rest of your life, or never have pizza again, which one would you choose?\" 

These words have lingered with me a long time, and it is establishments such as Famoso that draw me to my conclusion....I would definitely choose PIZZA FOR LIFE. 

I first experienced Famoso's in Victoria upon recommendation from one of my favourite fellow vegans, and they did not disappoint. For this reason, I headed to the Calgary location as soon as I got home to see if the pizza is consistent. It is.

My personal favourite is a vegetarian option, the Primavera, mostly because I am a sucker for a good artichoke heart. I subbed the vegan cheese option, but honestly I am not much of a fan of the daiya shreds and could easily eat most of the Famoso's pizza without and be just as pleased. The pizza crust is sooooo soft, I just want to wrap up my pizza and eat it whole! I like to order the half sized pizza, and pair it with this great salad  that contains greens, chickpeas, and a great balsamic dressing. I could eat just that salad. Especially with the flatbread that comes on the side.

The service is friendly here, but the system is still a little shaky. It seems overstaffed for a place where people are \"serving themselves\" and bringing their orders right up to the till. Weird. 

*Review 18/30 of Yelp's 30 day challenge 2012"}
{"text":"After a bad experience at Via Vai for Neapolitain Pizza in Toronto I went out for lunch this afternoon to Famoso.  The restaurant delivered on all fronts.

The location is in a cool looking rotunda type building with lots of windows and high ceilings.  There was a moderate lunch time crowd there for a Monday afternoon.  The waitress was friendly, attentive, and also knew her menu items.  

Now onto the food!  We ordered the lunch specials which consisted of a pizzetta and either soup or salad.  Each pizza is hand tossed and fresh ingredients are used.  Both pizzas were delicious and the dough was thoroughly cooked with a crust that is firm yet having a slight resistance when pulled apart.  The taste was just right and complimented the toppings.

The tomato bisque according to my meal partner was like home made tomato bisque, creamy, well seasoned with pieces of basil mixed in.  It received a pass!  Meanwhile, my salad was good...hard to screw up salad unless they tried.

Yes, I would come back here.

Overall rating: 4/5
Experience: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"I have friends who rave about Famosa (to the point they're looking at their own franchise) so thought it was long overdue to give them a try.

Location is good, ambiance is funky but a bit too loud (in particular if you're looking for somewhere romantic), service is friendly.  The pizza is.....well, its interesting.  I know they take pride in their dough and it is different.  Less what you'd expect in a pizza and more along the lines of naan.  Very chewy.  Not necessarily a bad thing just different.  The various pre-designed pizzas looked interesting and of the three we tried the pear gorgonzola.  Great mix of flavors but could have done without the excessive amount of arugula scattered on top.  Our other three pizzas were OK but a little on the bland side.  

They probably deserve better than a 2 star rating but given the hype I was expecting more.

That said, will likely go back and give them another shot."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up. A large pizza.. And when we got there they had made a medium. We didn't want to wait around for them to make the right size. Otherwise it was very good though. If we go back again hoping that they can get the order right"}
{"text":"I was SO excited when this location opened up!  It was so worth the wait.  
Many may not agree with the style of service but I think it's a great idea.  As you are seated, you review the menu and place your order at the order desk.  Your server then brings you your drinks and will continue to service you throughout your meal.  
Their pizza is the traditional thin crust Neopolitan pizza.  Their menu has a great selection of starters, pizzas and desserts.  On our first visit we had Cavoletti - Oven-roasted Brussels sprouts, prosciutto crisps, gorgonzola cheese, dates, walnuts, drizzle of honey & the Funghi - Parmesan crema, fior-di-latte, roasted white mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, caramelized onions, white truffle oil, pecorino romano.  We also shared their Gorgonzola Walnut Salad - Romaine lettuce, gorgonzola cheese, walnuts, semi-dried cranberries, gorgonzola walnut vinaigrette. All items were AMAZING!  Sometimes with thin crust pizza's they come burnt in some places.  But everything was cooked well and tasted amazing.
We ended our meal with their Nutella and Banana pizza ... OMG it was heaven on a plate!  So delicious and oozing of Nutella.  Upon our next visit we will definitely try their gelato.  
We will definitely be back as it is in a convenient location for us and I love the fact they do take-out!
Great job Famoso!"}
{"text":"Ok, everyone likes to rave about the Neapolitan style of pizza.  Thin crust, robust ingrediants, trendy and modern atmosphere... but... well... the pizza just wasn't all that great.  Compared with actual Neapolitan I tried in Venice, a slice of pepperoni in NYC, good deep dish from Chicago, and a wicked slice from Nikos here in Calgary, it just wasnt the party in my mouth as they made it out to be.

I would say that if you really want to try what is supposed to be the authentic thing to munch on, it's worth a try.  But it just wasn't the be all and end all to pizza for me."}
{"text":"I've downgraded this restaurant's rating as I don't believe it is managed very well.  I had booked a reservation in their bottom floor which is a more private setting for my son's baby shower. A few weeks before the event someone called to tell me that they needed to cancel my reservation. I tried to explain to the person on the phone that I had already sent out invitations to my guests. I kept getting interrupted and when I asked for an explanation, it seems like she was just blaming \"head office\" as they extended the renovations timline. The woman on the phone should not be working in a customer service capacity. Not only did she have not have any decisive answers, she was quite rude on the phone constantly interrupting me. I did get angry and she said someone would call me to explain and possibly book me at their West Hills location. After a few weeks I got a call from a general manager who assured me they'd do better and then contact me after to invite me to their grand reopening. I've never heard back since."}
{"text":"Definitely delicious !!... This place has one of the best pizzas in town... I liked all I tried!!.. The duck pizza was awesome!!.. and the nutella pizzola was delicious!!.. it made me forget my diet!... In addition, the service is excellent!!.. The desserts are very good.. And the wine is not bad, for a pizza restaurant.. I can't wait to go back there!!.."}
{"text":"The pizzas are good... But I think my expectations were higher for this place... The service was not bad and the cocktails were good as well... I wouldn't say the pizzas are bad, but I would say they are average good... Nothing incredible..."}
{"text":"Came here with my BF on a Sunday evening, the place was packed, mostly with families. It was pretty noisey so we didn't feel like waiting too long, decided to just sit at the bar. Later we realized that there was an open 2 seater table in which the hostess didn't even realize herself, so we got another server to seat us there. 

The pizza itself was good, definitely authentic Italian and just the right amount of spicy for what we ordered, but it took SO LONG. Most of the time the pizza was sitting on the counter waiting for the server to bring it over to us, but she didn't until way later. She also never came to check up on us for water, didn't give us napkins, and generally just didn't really care, asking for the bill took over 10 minutes...??!

We decided to get the strawberry mojito because it looked refreshing, it was good but the glass was honestly 3/4 ice with some really old looking mint leaves, so pretty disappointed. 

Since this is a chain restaurant mostly serving families I didn't expect too much, but I give it 3/5 instead of 2/5 because the pizza was actually pretty good. Otherwise, the drinks, the service, the price for what you get, eh."}
{"text":"This little slice of Italian heaven never let's me down. They offer a vast array of topping options, I've never had the same pizza twice, and they were all amazing! Even off beat choices like the spicy Thai chicken, was a crowd pleaser. Plus it's so very hard to find the perfect thin, chewy Neapolitan style crust that they do so well. The food is always consistently delicious, no matter what we order, the drink menu is well rounded, the service is always friendly and the atmosphere is laid back & casual. It's a great spot for a low key dinner or even a quick lunch. :)"}
{"text":"Service and food are average. My friend and I decided to give this place a try since we were in the area, and in the mood for pizza. 
We ordered 2 dishes to share the shrimp pesto pizza, as well as the Mac and cheese. 
The pizza wasn't bad. The flavours were pretty good, but the pizza became soggy towards its middle after sitting for a few minutes, which made it difficult to eat. 
The Mac and cheese had a nice smoky flavour, but the noodles were somewhat dry. 
We decided to try the caramelized bananas for dessert. They were good, they reminded me of how my mom makes them. 
In all it was a good experience, although the food was lacking in lustre it's a good place to be social and grab a cheap bite with friends."}
{"text":"The lunch special is a great deal. The tomato bisque is a must try! The pizza is authentic and is not greasy. Ingredients are very fresh. The atmosphere is charming as well. Good place for families and first dates alike."}
{"text":"Long way to go to getting a \"Gluten Free Pizza Crust\" right.
The first one I ordered was undercooked and doughy.  They made me a second one that was cooked better but the soft crust was ok in the middle and chewy like old bubblegum around the edges.
I will not go to Famoso again.
Staff was overworked and unable to attend us for drinks or to check with me regarding the second pizza."}
{"text":"Not bad but not amazing! I'd come here for a quick dinner if it was close by but wouldn't go out of my way for it. Like a previous review says the toppings are sparse and service is average. I do really enjoy the gelato flavours though!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying \"I LOVE FAMOSO\". We are from Edmonton and have eaten at various locations there for years, whether dine in or take out. We arrived in Calgary tonight tired after a long drive with our young kids and I went to order take-out. I ordered 2 pizzas and some Mediterranean bread from the girl at the till and was told it would be 15 min. Perfect. 30 min later I start watching the over like a hawk, hoping my pizzas are going in soon. Several burnt pizzas were noted, and people who ordered after me are getting their stuff. I was about to get up and ask about the order when I see some take-out boxes go up on the counter!  Yeah! Nope, not mine. 45 min after ordering I get my 3 boxes, one of which has a very soggy, undercooked pizza in it. Guess after burning one or two they decided undercooked was safer??? Nothing ever said to me by service staff, just \"here's your pizza\". I will note, the place was not busy for a Saturday night, its the long weekend. VERY disappointed with the product here and the service staff. Hopefully the franchise has does quality control follow-up."}
{"text":"Decided to give Famoso a try.  We had the Caprese Salad - full.  It was delicious and light; tomatoa slices with boconcinni cheese and lightly doused with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  Such a nice salad for a warm day.  Our pizzas came next:  Abruzzo and the Korean BBQ Beef.  We liked both of them.  Tasty pizzas eventhough they were thin crust pizza.  We had to wait for the Korean pizza as I think it got burnt in their pizza oven.  But it came out in a jiff and it was worth the wait. Make sure you ask for their home made chilli oil (free of charge).  Went really well with the pizzas.   Dessert was a double gelato: Madagascar Vanilla and Salted Caramel Dark Chocolate.  Still licking my lips!  

The waitress was so nice.  She gave us each a loyalty card and for future visits to save 15% off.  Also a tip for you, the receipt they give you is also a 10% discount for a future visit.  All these savings... have to go back!"}
{"text":"Curious and unusual ordering process 

1. being seated at a table, 
2. looking a the menu, 
3. having the server come over explain the dishes
4. having the server tell you you have to get up and go the cash registers to order
5. Getting up and going to the cash register to order
6. Sitting down
7. Being told that addition items being ordered after the initial order CAN be ordered by the server.

Despite whatever is going on with that ordeal, which definately needs fixing, the people, food and service are excellent.  Large number of fresh, tasty meats, vegetable and cheese topping.  Fresh, tasty tomato sauce is very well done. Wood fire oven pizza and sandwiches, great salads and tasty appetizers all themed around Neopolitan style pizza and cuisine.  A little gelato bar tops off the evening in classic Neopolitan style.  Nice concept.  If not already a franchaise, has a lot of potential to become a successful one."}
{"text":"Came back due to choice by a family member I was meeting.  They have certainly upped their game, offering, and service levels.  I really enjoyed their new funghi tartufo pizza, my niece devoured her Italian ham and pineapple and two slices of my pizza AND more than half my tiramisu; and she is a picky eater!  

My only qualm is that the wine by the glass offered is not great. I may return next time I am in Calgary and looking for some pizza."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of Famosa. But was very disappointed. We were seated in the basement - which was like sitting in a high school cafeteria. There goes any hope of atmosphere!

The pizza's arrived in no time. Which would explain the soft, doughy, limp 'crust'.  There may have been flavor but it was lost in the dough.

Overall a huge disappointment and I guarantee we won't be back."}
{"text":"It's Famoso! ... and for good reason! 

Famoso is my favourite (so far!) of the (now) many Napoletana pizza joints in town. 
For quality vs. price, I just find it to hit the nail right on the head.

Jessica and I went on a tomato/meatball FRENZY last time we ate here ... and boy did it pay off! Both the Meatball appetizer and the Meatball pizza (I guess we REALLY like meatballs?) were so good! 

I know a lot of people might take issue with the ordering system/setup, but I personally like it. It makes me feel like I am actually in some Euro eatery in Italy. Just go with it! Bust yourself outside your comfort zone, son!

A word of recommendation ... get there early! 
We came at 5:00 on the nose on a Friday and were able to find a spot fairly easily. On the way out, there were hordes of people waiting outside to get a seat!"}
{"text":"I apologize to all the guys who gave Famoso lots of stars and called it something like a best pizzeria in Calgary. If that's really the best - well, maybe there is an opportunity for improvement. :-)

In my opinion that model when you are sort of \"booking\" the pizza, partially helped by a server, partially \"do it yourself\" style is not at all comfortable, or even fast. Rather weird, especially when the waiters are distracted by other people around.

But overcoming that, quality of the pizzas we've tried in a couple of occasions was decent, portions were big and price was ok. Not something to dream about, but not bad at all. Again, tastes may vary and I totally respect the opinions of the other people - it is just that for me those pizzas were right at 3 stars, maximum 3,5.

Another point in favour of Famoso is that there really wasn't anything comparable in 6-7 blocks around, so when we were going for the evening walk - it was an obvious choice. Except for that I would not recommend Famoso as something worth travelling to discover."}
{"text":"Famoso has lots of great pizzas to choose from, and they are always busy at this location as it is a great spot for a date, for families, or to watch the game.

The servers have always generally been friendly when we've come to sit down or take out pizza.   We love the crust here, as well as the delicious pizza options.  My husband and I love their brussel sprouts and walnut pizza with a honey drizzle.   

I also love that they have other options on the menu.   I like ordering the pizzette - a smaller pizza with 4 small slices that you can partner with a salad.   

Famoso is definitely somewhere I go back again and again for the great pizza crust, and down to earth dining room."}
