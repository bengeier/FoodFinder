{"text":"This place is close to my work.. my boss introduced it to me a while back and have been hooked ever since! First off everybody that works there has great customer service even when they have been slammed. I have never had to wait a long time for take out or delivery. There is no delivery fee which is a huge generosity to their customers and also helps when I am slammed at work and can't leave for lunch. Seems like it's a family owned joint and very personable business. I get their chicken salad sub almost everytime it's quite delicious! I have gotten a few other items as well and have never been dissapointed by anything I have tried! I would say this is one of my favorite spots to eat at in town.. thanks Bobs Deli!!! :)"}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars primarily because of their outstanding delivery service. The food is fine, consistent diner food, big portions and always fresh. I work down the street and don't have a car so Bobs is always willing to deliver for free and no minimum order amount is required. They'll deliver me a 3.99 breakfast with no charge anytime, even early mornings. I love the good service and fresh food."}
{"text":"Nice little place to grab a quick bite to eat. Their menu is very large offering everything from sandwiches to anything fried. It's kinda tucked away in a business complex area but worth the visit. Employees are super personable and down to earth."}
{"text":"Seriously just had the best sub ever! Please go order the Marino's Special and everything else there. Great food and great prices!"}
{"text":"YUM! this place has Amazing breakfast! I Come here quite often! Very friendly staff and fast service! You also get a bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"OK. This is HUGE news. I have found the absolute best deli in Las Vegas. Seriously. Bob's East Side Deli offers a great selection for breakfast and lunch. You would never notice the actual building, because it is smack dab in the middle of two office parks, but if you find it, it's like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Hot subs, cold subs, salads, side dishes, and great homemade desserts are just the beginning of the lunch menu. The bread for all of the subs and sandwiches is baked fresh as well. The actual deli is not a place I would recommend  for a quiet, peaceful lunch. It is buzzing with traffic constantly. Businessmen, students, and nearby residents jam pack this smaller deli around lunch time, so make sure you know what to order before getting to the front of the line. Or, they offer delivery, faxed orders, and call-ins. If you work in the vicinity, or are simply searching for the perfect sub, Bob's is the place for you.  Recommended sub: Marino's Special, which is a meat lover's delight!   Recommended dessert: The chocolate brownie is perfection wrapped in plastic."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but they \"don't deliver to houses, only commercial buildings\" which is just stupid especially since they don't say that in the first place."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Bob's you need to go. All I need to say is old school Italian family style deli. The service is excellent. The food, prices and portion sizes are spot on. In addition to all that the place is clean. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the furniture needs to be updated to include maybe a booth or two. Other than that, Bob's is worth giving your hard earned money to."}
{"text":"foods alright. Staff needs to wear work shirts. The women working there were wearing tacky no sleave shirts. Look professional, it will make a differance."}
{"text":"Awesome food & great value. My 1st visit here, but will be back to try more if the menu. Chicken salad wrap and fresh cut fries were awesome and too much for me to finish...which is very rare."}
{"text":"Having family ties to New York this place is a hidden treat in Las Vegas. The corn beef and pastrami sandwiches reminded me of the old Jewish deli in new work city. Friendly people who want to make sure you get exactly what you want and make sure you leave satisfied and full. The menu options are plentiful so I'm sure that there is something for everyone. I wish they were open later so get there early! Can't wait to go back for another delicious treat."}
{"text":"Fantastic French Dip!  Their bread melts in your mouth. The au jus is great, not super salty like most places. Very generous portions of meat. I suggest you only go here if you are in the mood for a GREAT sandwich."}
{"text":"Their breakfast and lunch is delicious. Free delivery with no minimum purchase is great. So many people in our office order from Bob's. :) And the prices are very good."}
{"text":"DO NOT go here!!!! This place is a joke!! My wife and I finally decided to go here after driving by the sign 100 times. We sure regret it!!! I should've known right off the bat when we asked a question about the corned beef hash and our answer was IDK, it's not homemade... We ordered the \"hungry man\" breakfast! Disgusting!!! It says it comes with a huge slab of ham along with eggs, hash browns, toast. The ham was a perfectly cut square THIN slice. It looked and tasted like an oversized slice of \"spam\". The hash brown was a oil soaked , soggy, frozen piece of slip!!!! I ordered a English muffin instead of the toast and that was also a soggy, cold muffin that seemed to be put in the microwave for 20 seconds rather than toasted... my wife got the sausage instead of ham and that was exactly like McDonald's patty and barely heated.. To be honest, McDonald's big breakfast is 10 times better for half the price! The hash brown was exactly like McDonald's too rather than real home made hash browns.At least McDonald's serves theirs crispy unlike this place. So my suggestion is DO NOT go here and if your looking for a breakfast like this, just go to McDonald's!! You can even get a large iced coffee there along with your breakfast and still not pay as much as this so called deli!!! We looked around and noticed all the meats for subs are already cut with cheese on it placed on a pan rather  than sliced fresh when you order. I can only imagine what the subs are like but I'll never know because this place will never receive 1 more penny from us!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time visit. The sandwich was great. Had the corned beef Reuben. The french fries were OK. My friend had the chicken Philly. Said it was great. We will go back. Good prices, great service, good food."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst omelette I have ever had. If I wasn't so hungry and pressed for time I would have thrown it in the trash and left. Horrible food, and even more horrible service. I gave it 1 star because you have to make a selection otherwise i would have given ZERO stars. Don't waste your money or your time."}
{"text":"After completing my online order for a company that orders from this place weekly. I was charged a different total than my confirmation. When i called to question this i was given a story of a website glitch and extra charges that was never discussed, nor was i contacted. I was then hung up on. I called again and was called \"Baby\" and transferred to Bob the owner, where i was ridiculed and spoken to as if i was a 5 year old. I explained that the eCommerce of their site should have added \"these extra charges\" or at least i should have been contacted when the total was dramatically different than what was confirmed. Bob proceeded to give me a lesson on his use of commas on his menu and his menu pricing suggesting that it is common sense and adding totals should be easy from their. I explained that my total was in fact correct and the lines of his menu suggest a different price entirely. Bob laughed at me repeatedly through out this call. I asked why i was being held responsible for a glitch in his system and he continued to argue with me. He then told me he is taking down his site, i request a refund in the difference from HIS mistake and hung up on me. What happened to customer service? BOB- you are by far an arrogant person that does not have a top customers well being nor dedication in mind- TERRIBLE experience...  and this company will never support your \"Deli\" as well as the entire business park surrounding.  Customer Service...... thanks for setting a great example!"}
{"text":"Place is killer!  Free delivery.  Only place that is competent enough to deliver to airport and know where exactly to go! Food is awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice in the last week, and while the experiences weren't bad, it wasn't what I hyped it up to be.    My girlfriend raves about this place for awhile now, so we went on Saturday and ordered two sandwiches.  It was my first time, but she had been there previously.  She ordered a chicken sandwich, I had a Marino (Italian sandwich).  My sandwich was decent; not great, but not terrible; though it was missing mayo, but it wasn't a big deal, I just like it and they said it automatically comes with it.  I'd definitely go again.  For that order, we took it to go, but yesterday we went during lunch rush to dine in and the restaurant was packed.  This is to be expected, it's lunchtime and the place isn't that big, so I wasn't too upset with the wait time.  I ordered a chicken finger sub, but they misheard me and gave me a chicken finger meal with fries.  It wasn't the end of the world, as I was hungry and it was good.    I want to go back again, because the menu is pretty big and I haven't found that dish that floors me yet.  Service is good, and it's a quaint little NY-themed place.  So far, it just hasn't matched my expectations."}
{"text":"Oddly set in the corner of a business park, Bob's is the kind of place you can drive by a million times without really noticing. It doesn't help that there's no OPEN sign, so after their lunch rush it looks pretty deserted from the outside.  But if you stop in during business hours (they close at 4PM on weekdays, 1PM on Saturdays), you'll find a positive alternative to the $5 foot long. Bob's makes a better sandwich at a similar size, thick with fresh-cut Boar's Head meats and fresh veggies. The Marino's Special (Ham, Salami, Capicola, Pepperoni, Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Oil & Vinegar) is my pick, and the portion is enough for two meals, and only $7.  Come by after about 2PM, and you'll see a few students around from nearby Del Sol high school- found the NO STUDENTS IN BATHROOMS signage to be a little off putting, but the kids present were quiet and respectful. I also noticed that all the students were getting the chicken strips meal, maybe something else to check out if you don't dig sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is good. Really good, actually. It's sort of hard to find, tucked away in some pseudo-industrial officeplex on E Patrick (just west of Del Sol, on the north side of the street). You can definitely tell it's a locally owned and operated kinda place. It would get five stars, but my corned beef sandwich was, though completely satisfactory, not stellar. My friend's meatball sub, however, WAS stellar. So get that. They make their meatballs fresh by hand. In fact, the owner is the one who made our sandwiches. Nice guy, in an east coat deli proprietor sorta way. Really, they deserve five stars just for the \"no students in the bathroom\" signs on the bathroom doors. Pretty damn funny if you ask me. Definitely worth checking out for a quick lunch, especially on your way to or from McCarran. As far as delis in Las Vegas go, you're really not gonna do any better. And that's not a bad thing."}
{"text":"Bob's is a good fast sandwich spot. The prices are fair and the food is good.  There isn't much to say about bobs.. it's not fancy, trendy or creative. Just good sandwiches at a good price. Much better than all the chain spots in the area.   I would like to see more specials or warm lunchs. But simple, fast and friendly is great. If you are in the area you should grab a Sammy."}
{"text":"Chris and I had errands to run and little time for food. We decided that we'd do sandwiches. Chris had eaten Bob's before, I had not. Chris is picky, so anything he'll eat more than once is always a good sign.   We stopped off for lunch at this little side shop that I would never have noticed otherwise. It's tucked next to a business area on a non-arterial road.   The place is small, though big enough for the crowd. The customers range from bikers, businessmen, college students, etc. It was a wide array of patrons when we went in. The place is run by the family, with reminiscent decor. The tables and chairs seemed as tough they were taken out of an old cafeteria, though they were not uncomfortable.   For the price we paid, the meal was worth it. Chris ordered the Toll's Creation, a generous helping of roast beef, turkey and ham with toppings specific to Chris' taste. Aside from the fact he ordered EXTRA mayo and still received a meager rationing, the sandwich was great.   I ordered the Chicken Philly, sans peppers. It was large, juicy and delicious. The portions/servings were adequate to the price (both our orders being between $6.50 - $7.00).   All in all, it was a good place which I would definitely go to again."}
{"text":"Always ordering for delivery @ the hospital I work at. There super fast at delivering my food and the chicken strips are fresh and delicious. Couldn't be more satisfy with there food. Customer service is perfect and couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried bobs country fried steak sandwich boy are you missing it I love the menu at bobs but my go to is the Country fried steak sandwich when every I order out for lunch this is my go to their menu is taped to my desk"}
{"text":"I work not to far from this business. They do free delivery. I usually order breakfast because they have a meal called \"the hungry man\" it's 3 eggs, 2 slices of toast, hash browns, (ham, 2 bacon, sausage patty) your choice. All for less that $5 Lunch I'll order the chicken strips with seasoned fries or the hamburger.    Everything I have ordered has been pretty good. The only down side is sometimes it takes 20mins and others it's been up to 80mins after calling 3 times. Blames it on construction or traffic. It's less than 2miles straight down the road. Get a huffy and deliver it lol"}
{"text":"This place is great. I love the food, I love the atmosphere. It has great customer service. The staff is amazing, they do their best to make you feel welcome. They even do the best they can to memorize every customer's names. It's very friendly. The staff works as fast as they can to get everyone's food out as quickly as they can, and still manage to give great service and food. I would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I placed an order for my company lunch this past Monday, 4/16.  They were so friendly and patient with me continuously calling to add *just one more order*.  The food delivered on time and everything was really delicious! Thank you Bob's East Side Deli!  Looking forward to the next time we order from you!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Our business is across the street so we go there often. Friendly staff and haven't had a single issue with any order out of hundreds."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, always super nice. I've only gotten their breakfast but I'm sold based off the hungry man burrito and breakfast sandwiches. It tastes super fresh and they delivery very quickly. Plus their delivery is free!   I get the hungry man burrito with eggs over medium   . It's messy but delicious. Check this place out"}
{"text":"BY FAR the BEST Deli in Vegas. Being from NY originally this is thebest place for a great, no PHENOMINAL breakfast sandwich. The sandwhiches are incredible. I am not sure what kind of bread he uses but it is the BEST. I cant believe that more people do not know about this place. It is hidden in a more commerical area but I literally go to eat there almost every weekend. I cant get enough of the double egg cheese and sausage breakfast sandwich! If you have not tried it you need to!!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I order breakfast from Bob's a few times a month.  The Hungry Man Hero is a huge breakfast sandwich.  It is so good.  You pick your meat (ham, sausage or bacon) and how you want your eggs(i go over medium) and it is put on a huge sub roll with cheese and fried hashbrown patty.  I usually have half for breakfast and the other half for lunch.  It is that big.  How much you ask?  Only $3.99...really it's $3.99.  We always get it delivered.  They can get busy at times but they always get it to us quick.  We have ordered a few times for lunch.  Lunch is average.  Seems like most things are pre packaged, like frozen and then cooked or fried. Prices are cheap and there is no minimum for delivery which is nice.  Def give them a try if you work or live in the area."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for lunch ... I have heard of it before and am surprised I haven't tried this place. Me and my friend ordered and shared an Eggplant Parm sandwich and a Pastrami Reuben ... Both sandwiches were delish ... I will for sure get a Reuben again ... The staff was helpful with suggestions and very nice .. I think they deserve 5 stars this time !!!"}
{"text":"Hungry man special is the way to go. 3 eggs, 3 bacon, hashbrowns and toast of your choice.  At a great price. As always staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I've been coming here for the last 15 or 16 years and I've always been treated right! The Bobs he said Deli family is amazing and they do a great job food is always great and it is a family owned business! Bob and Doreen are amazing at what they doand all of their staff love being here and it makes the environment great! Thanks for the years of great service guys you're amazing!"}
{"text":"Best Deli! Every time I go to this establishment it's a great experience, the sandwiches are delicious, and the service is always exceptional."}
{"text":"Overall this place is pretty good.  I really dig there fish and chips(huge pieces of fish) and I love their italian sub. I actually like it better than capriottis and its cheaper!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for quick breakfast that was cooked perfectly and quickly. Recommended to take a blueberry muffin for the road. It was soft, moist inside and slightly browned outside. It was awesome."}
{"text":"The pastrami is one of the best that I've had in a while...not too lean and not too fatty. If you want a leaner meat, then corned beef is your best bet. I've also tried their calamari the other day and I want to point out that they are rings and not the real deal you'd get at a restaurant.  I tend to forget.   The place gets high school kids coming in once school is done for the day,  so in case you were wondering about why there are signs that say \"no students in the bathroom\".  All in all, pretty good place for deli sandwiches."}
{"text":"Herd about this spot from my girl and have to admit it's not bad.   I'll be back"}
{"text":"I have been going to Bobs since I was in middle school. I do have to say that they have the absolute best chicken fingers! Everyone there is nice as well. They are always very cheery and happy when you go in there. Not only does this place serve good food but it smells like food heaven when you walk in too. They have great quality food and service for a great price!"}
{"text":"Bob is typical mean, \"back east\" guy. Yelled at a bunch of kids to get out of his shop. I talked to the kids on my way out and they said they just want to eat. Embarrassing!! Food is average. Bread old and dry."}
{"text":"corned beef, pastrami, and love. all the things u get at bob's deli. thanks for remembering me guys. didnt show up there for 3 years and walk in and they even remembered my name! food awesome people awesome. feels and tastes like new york again"}
{"text":"My favorite place for a sub in Vegas! The best bread and Marino's Special is hands down one of the best subs I've ever had! Don't miss Bob's East Side Deli when you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and so I've ordered a few times without issue when the woman was taking calls. The food isn't great, just okay. However, twice now I've had an issue with whoever the older man is that answers the phone. One time- I try to give the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he's just having a bad day. Two times- Nope.   The last two times I've tried to order, he has spoken to me like sh*t. Absolutely no customer service skills and disrespectful as hell. Not that I expect a ton from a busy deli, but he was so incredibly rude this last time that I will never try to order from them again."}
{"text":"Walked in and the menu is huge! So I asked the lady what do you recommend? She takes a deep breath as if she is irritated and says \"anything that is home made is good!\"... she rifles some things off and we ordered two chicken parm sandwiches. They didn't really taste fresh or seasoned. They tasted like something I would get served at a hospital cafeteria! So the not so great food and the shitty service, I'll just go to firehouse subs next time!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time.  I have eaten here on several occasions over the years.  I have never had anything bad.  My problem is that my favorite sandwich in the world is a Reuben.  When I ordered a Reuben at Bobs I was told that his Reuben was made with mustard and not Russian dressing.  If you change the recipe doesn't that change the name of the sandwich?  I like mustard, just not on my Reuben sandwich. If you are going to serve one of the countries great sandwiches DO IT RIGHT."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast.. so I can't comment on the lunch menu. The breakfast I make at home is way better. The breakfast menu is so simple it hurts to talk about. The bacon reminded me of my days in the military chow hall or buffet style bacon that sits in a silver container filled with oil. I imagine the lunch side of this deli is where its at, but we eat at so many other lunch spots, I doubt I will ever know.."}
{"text":"Freshly made sandwich shop w/ a great breakfast menu before 11am. Prices are better than Capriotti's and the sandwiches are huge. Very casual atmosphere, walk up deli. It feels like you were in a little family owned place in NY. Not very Vegan friendly, it's not what it set out to be so that's fair."}
{"text":"I've been ordering here for years now.  I like it and it's my go to place when it's time to eat lunch.  They deliver to the surrounding are which makes me happy.  I eat their food with the swiftness and it fills me up and puts a smile on my face.  When I'm happy everything around me is happy too.  I love food"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Bob's since first location 25 years and will remain faithful customers!  The best deli subs and grill items.  If you are making an early drive south on the I-15 they make a great breakfast also."}
{"text":"Horrible phone etiquette, need more than one phone line. They seem to be very busy for how awful their service is. They are out of half of the menu items and while they offer delivery their wait time is over an HOUR! Not impressed and definitely never going here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, great customer service and everyone is so happy and smiling! If you want great food at a fantastic price, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the ladies who work there are always so grumpy. It seems like if you're not a regular customer they don't give a damn about you."}
{"text":"Omg! This place is definitely buried treasure. Its none of that corporate bs like from subway, quiznos, or capriottis. It just screams local and awesome. I used to go there every morning after work to get sandwiches and breakfast. Or sandwiches for breakfast. They are only open for lunch. It is a mom and pops sandwich joint. They slice their own deli, and EVERYTHING is homemade. The prices are so cheap, and you get a good amount of food for the cost. It is a bargain. I sandwiches are huge and range about 6 to 7 bucks. I personally love their reuben and corned beef hash sandwich on rye. Its full of flavor, and loaded with meat. As far as breakfast dishes, I recommend their breakfast steak sandwich, and their 2.99 corned beer breakfast. You also have to get a side of hash browns with anything! The hash browns are lightly brown, extra crispy, and soft in the center. Just the way a hash brown should be. I mean...I even close my eyes sometimes when I take bites of their hash browns.  Oh...and their service is awesome. They get very personal with you, and they speak to you with your name as if they've known you for years. They remember faces, even if you only go there a few times. Definitely come here for lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very good service, will come back again. The pastrami rueben was one of the best I have had."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!! I've never had anything bad here! Great little hidden away spot!!! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"It's a hidden gem.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The menu has a lot of options.  We had the Ruben it was on amazing rye bread and had great flavor.  I had a Gia special I would request extra tomato and mayo a little on the dry side.  The fish and chips looked delicious that will be my next pick. Try it"}
{"text":"Tried Bob's for the first time this morning. I ordered the \"hungry man hero\" and it was very good, and cheap. My girlfriend had the veggie omelette and she liked that as well. Bread was freshly baked. Our main gripe is that everything is served on disposable styrofoam, even for people dining in. Seems like they could cut down on all the waste by using reusable plates/glasses/utensils, or at least paper plates/cups, which would be more environmentally friendly than all of that styrofoam."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Has a nice deli counter. The breakfast sandwiches are really good.  The $3.99 breakfast doesn't look like much but don't let that fool you it is delish. Three eggs, bacon, sausage or ham (pick one), hashbrowns and toast. This place opens early and closes at 4pm blink and you'll miss it because it is in an industrial area. The owners work here too as it is family own. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"yum yum yummy !!!!!!!!  I only came here real quick for something to put in my tummy while i was running errands.  I wasnt starving so i got a muffin and a large diet coke....  The drink cup was HUGE !!! And only 1.83 !!!  The muffin was amazing....so good and fresh and big !!!  Cant wait to go back and try more from their menu when im a but more hungry."}
{"text":"So this review has nothing to do with the food as my sandwich was delicious. However, the service rubbed me the wrong way.  I came to order some lunch with a coworker and was next in line to order. A man, who I assume was a regular customer, was standing behind me. Rather than take my order the cashier asked the man behind me what he wanted that day and completely ignored the fact that I was standing right in front of her. It was SO rude!  Way to wow a new customer. I won't be going back. There are plenty of other options in that area for lunch that offer much better customer service. The food wasn't so good that I would tolerate bad customer service for a sandwich. Off to Subway!"}
{"text":"Always order the French and dip! I'll go with the usual French and dip, which is a roast beef sub with a tasty beef broth sauce. There's nothing like it- I'll order at least once a week for lunch from Bob's!"}
{"text":"Man I am so lucky this place is close to my office...Food is great, service is fantastic...Seems like a whole family runs the place....you can feel the love....wish there was another one by my house..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The people, the food, the prices can't be beat. The best Italian sub sandwiches since  leaving New Jersey. One of my all-time favorite eating establishments."}
{"text":"If you're on the East side and you're hankering for a sandwich, but you don't want to go the route of a chain, then Bob's is here for you!  Located in a business park off of Patrick Lane, Bob's is an unassuming joint. There is a sign leading the way for you though, so do not be afraid of the business-like exterior. Inside is a no-frills sandwich shop bringing you cold and hot sandwiches alike. Tables and chairs scream community kitchen, but do no be afraid, go ahead and order a sandwich.   I went with the simple cold, turkey, cheese, and salami with everything. Lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions. Also comes with mayo, which by the way, you should probably ask for light mayo if you are watching your figure, OR if you just don't want to have an over-slathering of mayo on your sandwich. Next time I'm there I'll opt for the lighter option. Other than the mayo the sandwich was great. Just enough meat and cheese and fillers in my opinion. There wasn't one prominent part of the sandwich. The bread was also incredibly soft making for a great texture wrapped around the meat, cheese, and veggies.  My husband went for the French Dip, while on the smallish side, he said was good. We also shared a bag of chips.  Bob's is simplistic. Sandwiches. Chips. Salami. Cheese. Bam. Bam. Bam. Don't expect any crazy aioli sauces or fancy-pants toppings for your sandwiches here.   I'll be back when I'm in the mood for a good deli sandwich."}
{"text":"Use to order here all the time because I work in the area. Called today at 1130 (on Saturday's they close at 1pm) and was told that why we're closing early because it was slow. It's 1130! Lunch is barely beginning! I work in a huge salon and will make sure to tell my coworkers to not bother ordering from there since they clearly didn't want to make some money on their slow day."}
{"text":"Hmmmm!! Yummy breakfast!! And the hungry man special is no more than $5! Which included 2 eggs, 4 pieces of toast, a crispy hash brown and a slice of ham! I made two breakfast sandwiches with it all! And it's just so delicious! A good ole mom and pop shop!   I phone ordered early in the am around 6am. On my way to work and took me about 10 minutes to get there, and it was practically ready, as soon as I finished paying order was up!   Most people complain about the location or of how hidden it is, fairly easy.. Across the street from Del Sol high school on Patrick Lane just on the west side of the school.   The lady was chipper and seemed surprised of how cheery I was at such an early time of the day. The coffee was just ok. On the plus side they did have small milk creamers in ice and lids for the cup to go! This wasn't my first time here, they usually deliver to my job. It was my first time walking in..! And I will sure be back for more tasty breakfast!! Can't wait to try the corn beef hash!"}
{"text":"I was getting an alignment on my car a few yards from this place and needed to kill some time. Rather than browsing social media for an hour, I decided to get something to eat because I'm a fat ass. Sure it was 3 pm and I already had lunch and had dinner plans later in the day, but screw it. Bob's came up on Yelp and I walked on over.  This seems to be a hang out spot after school for Del Sol because it was full of students, though I didn't mind and it didn't impact my visit. The guy at the counter was really helpful and helped me choose. I went with the Pastrami Reuben, which was tasty. I have friends originally from NY who say this is as close as you can get to NY authentic in Las Vegas, which is something to note. I personally don't care if it's authentic or inauthentic because I'm not a New Yorker and just want food regardless of label.  The decor is not a priority here. The vibe reminded me of a small cafeteria at a hospital because of the chairs and layout. It looks like a deli that happens to serve food rather than a diner. Also, the hours are limited compared to the usual place I'd go to for a pastrami."}
{"text":"Great local place!  I love places like this.  Family owned, and knows how to treat their guests.  Besides that, the food is great!  I had the Philly and Reuben there before and they were good!    Pro:  Hospitality Food and portions of orders.  Cons:  Closes in the afternoon.  -- However, considering their location, I understand."}
{"text":"For lunch you get a huge sandwich for moderate too pricey but it's a huge sandwich for breakfast?   not so much I just paid $4.32 for one English muffin and a piece of sausage, no salsa, no hot sauce, no cheese, no nothing And it was about a six minute wait three stars is still it's okay"}
{"text":"Excellent service (fast & friendly) catered for a company event & boy did they deliver :) great prices and they're so fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great service & food every time!!!! I think I've tried about everything on the menu & it's all fresh & delicious. My only complaint is they close too early & don't deliver to my house."}
{"text":"It can be hard to find. Just drive around the building you will see it!  I do believe that if you are looking for a great sub or sandwich you might have found a great spot.  We ordered salads, and don't get me wrong there was absolutly nothing wrong with them.  Its just that there was nothing special about them either.  I had the grilled chicken salad and it came with nothing more than tomato wedges, and mixed lettuce, the dressing and a chicken breast.  Tasted great the dressing was great, just nothing special.   The staff was very friendly and the food was good.  The dining room was clean and well kept.  Nothing fancy but for a quick lunch, who cares."}
{"text":"I like this place for a couple of things. They have great chicken fingers that comes with fries. The portion is large and a good price.  The chicken fried steak sandwich is on a sub roll. It tastes good but I think it would be better on a hamburger bun so the steak is whole rather than cut in pieces. It makes it difficult to eat plus it doesn't come with fries. The price is a little high since it is only the sandwich.   Their omelet is overpriced and small. The taste was also plain. I can make one a lot better at home. I do not recommend it.  The hungry man burrito is also plain. Again I can make it better at home but the price is decent.  So far it seems better to stay away from breakfast but the lunch items have been good."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. My sandwich was really good but everyone's food looked amazing, quick little cafe type place"}
{"text":"Somewhat off the beaten path and not an easy find, but the sandwiches are terrific.  Exactly what you would expect out of a quality deli.  The variety in the menu is good and they are more than accommodating if you want to make any modifications.  Solid place for a hearty sammie."}
{"text":"Don't do delivery. My food came totally messed up in every way. Not good at all."}
{"text":"Every time I crave a cold cut Italian sub (aka Marino's Special), this is where I go. Tastes the exact same each time I get it. Fresh ingredients, Boar's Head meats, the bread is on point and a dill pickle spear. I have yet to be disappointed.  Only thing is it can be a bit crowded during lunch due to the high school close by. Ordering Togo is the way to do it here."}
{"text":"Got the Marino Sandwich and Bob's Favorite.  Okay, my first time here.  Delicious.  I'll be back.  Stopped here on a whim.  Had read about it, never could find it.  It's a do over."}
{"text":"I'm in love with Bobs! First, they're Mets fans. They understand the struggle. More importantly, the service here is top notch and the food is delicious! I came here for a lunch meeting with my work team and hadn't planned on ordering anything. My food allergy restrictions due to nursing make eating out very difficult, so I don't even bother at new places. But the staff here was SO accommodating! They bent over backwards to make sure I could find  something safe to eat for lunch. They thoroughly cleaned the grill before making my chicken and looked up ingredients for salad dressings, etc. A lot of places do this begrudgingly but they were so happy to help. I so appreciated the kind and friendly service and all the trouble they took to help me out. This reminds of me of a good old authentic New York deli. It's not fancy, but prices are good, food is excellent, and service is great."}

{"text":"Its a small hidden gem. I had a egg and bacon sandwich on an English muffin which was very good. My niece and nephew had the chicken fingers which were huge almost look like chicken patties lol but they were good as well. All in all I would recommend this place they have a decent size menu that includes both breakfast and lunch items."}
{"text":"If you order breakfast, the hungry man is the way to go.  You can get it on a sub roll for an additional 50 cents.  I am carb conscious, so I order the cajun chicken sandwich on wheat bread with lettuce, tomato, and spicy mustard!  The BEST!  The selection chips, especially drinks, and homemade goodies are incredible!  Bob and Doreen, the owners, offer a superior quality product at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I love this place. Stumbled on it in 1998 when my roommate at the time was working in an office in the same complex. It's tucked away so you'll have to seek it out if you're not familiar with the complex. Every time I go to Las Vegas I make it a point to stop by at least once. It's about five minutes away from McCarran making for an easy stop either coming or going. Phil's Special with roast beef and turkey on their delicious bread is my go-to sandwich."}
{"text":"Ate lunch at Bob's yesterday. The Philly was ok but nothing spectacular. Half of the sandwich was full with meat, cheese and shrooms while the other half was definitely lacking.  We might go back, but the wait to order was long, with no line, and the prices aren't that great either so we won't be in a rush."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get breakfast it's amazing and the people are friendly. Pricing is right and I prefer this over any other breakfast place give it a try"}
{"text":"I was getting my car serviced over at Discount Muffler (great place by the way!) My belly was growling after another lady walked in with McDonald's, so I pulled out my Yelp app and it led me down the block to Bob's Deli.  This is by far the cheapest breakfast that I've had in a long time...corned beef hash, eggs, and toast all for under $4!  Most of their breakfast deals are under $5!  The corned beef hash was not overly salt, and it was a nice mix of corned beef and potatoes.  And you can never go wrong with some over easy eggs....now if only it came with rice =)."}
{"text":"I, along with my co-workers, have been ordering from Bob's East Dide Deli for more than two years now. I have to say that their breakfast sandwiches, steak & egg on a kaiser roll are the BOMB! Best damn sandwich ever! LOL Pretty much everything that I've tried is good, but those are exceptional. The delivery folks are awesome as well and fast delivery to where we are... all in all very good!"}
{"text":"Visited Lost Wages for a Bachelor party. Bob tailored the sandwiches to our liking. Supplied vegetable and fruit trays along with desserts for 30 people. Delivered on time and enjoyed immensely by everybody. I think the price quality relationship is a win/win for any event. I strongly recommend BESD for future get togethers!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their food is always great. I love their breakfast and the bacon burger! They know how to cook. I love the mom and pop feel. Plus they deliver!! Love them. A Vegas staple for sure"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a quick, cheap, and actually tasty breakfast this is a great option. 3 eggs, hash brown, meat of your choice and toast of your choice for 3.99! Ordered my eggs over medium, and alas, they came out perfectly over medium. Tough to stomach going to McDonalds when Bob's is down the street. Have not visited here for lunch yet but the affordable simplicity of a well cooked breakfast has sold me"}
{"text":"We stopped into Bob's for a late lunch having been on the road for quite some time and everyone in the car was hangry.  Service here was so amazingly friendly! The sandwiches were delicious and there was a huge selection (something for all tastes!)  Were I in the area I would be here frequently.  It's a fabulous lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This is the best deli sandwich in the Green Valley area.  Jan and Mr. Marino is genuine owners who do work the restaurant.  The portions are for the hungry man, the working man and my favorite is the Marino's Special cold sandwich.  The trick is Bob's is a luncheon and not open during the weekends."}
{"text":"Great food great prices and super close to my house ! Staff is friendly and cautious and that is key to me customer service is everything and they have it !!"}
