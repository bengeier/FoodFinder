{"text":"I always have the short ribs when I am here and it is very tasty. The serving is a good size and comes with a salad, miso soup, tea, glass noodles, rice, kimchi and some times seaweed. Everything tastes great and the ribs are always well marinated and easy to chew. The staff as well is very friendly and the prices are reasonable given all that you get. The food is always made quickly but parking at times is very hard to find at this mall, especially on weekends! It is definitely a great place to eat whether sitting down or taking out."}
{"text":"Worst sushi ever! But then, can't expect too much from a food court. Not sure what the other reviewers ate...but i wouldn't recommend it.  I had the Sushi Express. Waited 15-20 mins for it and it wasn't busy. The sea weed on the salmon roll was soggy, tasted old (much like the ones I used at home that has been left in the cabinet for 1/2 year). The salad was watery, probably because they didn't dry the lettuce after wash. The rice on the sushi was dry and under cooked. You can taste the cheap rice that was used. The sashimi was fresh though, but that's the only good thing....  For cheaper price, I had much better quality food at the sit-down japanese/korean place near to the escalator."}
{"text":"I always eat here when I'm at pacific mall. Would give a five star if service was a little friendlier. But food is good!"}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot, but I find their sushi have gone downhill :( I was served COLD spicy salmon rolls. The rice was cold and hard, not warm and soft like it used to :("}
{"text":"Just like the other reviewer had mentioned, this is my go-to food place at Pmall! The owners are cute and nice, and their daughter I presume, is always there taking orders!   As a vegetarian I go for their vegetarian maki combo or just plain avocado roll. The avocados are always fresh and the yam tempura that comes in the combo are crispy!   As well they usually give you a side of soup or tea with any meal!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Pmall for Y E A R S, and even with all the variety of chinese food. I am always eating here. I love it. Great price for great japanese food. Definitely can't get anything like this at any other mall.  I tend to get either the chirashi, sashimi bento, or seafood udon. ...I really should mix it up though. ^^;;"}
{"text":"Wanna to grab something quick and my kids wanted Jap Chae so we picked this place. Great customer services. They were nice to accommodate our request for hot (warm) Jap Chae. We also ordered a Donburi (#48). It was made nice and crispy. She made it right in front of us.   Food was very tasty. No complaints."}
{"text":"Japanese Express is one of my top dining spots when I somehow end up in Pacific Mall. It's located at the 2nd level near the back of the mall (pass the mini bridge with the pond). It's the only food stall with it's own seating area.  Their bento boxes are very good quality for the price you pay, but my absolute must-order is their Japchae which they sell by the pound... dare I say, it's the best Japchae I've had!  It's cash only and there is rarely a free seat in the food court, but I'll eat standing up if I have to... or just get take-away."}
{"text":"Good option for fast food type of Japanese food. Their menu board is filled with a lot of options, and I would recommend their bento box selections. If you choose to eat in the food court area, you get the regular bento boxes that you see in eat-in restaurants. When you finish your meal, just leave the bento box at the tray drop off area.   Slightly more on the expensive side compared to other options in Pacific Mall, but good quality and decent size meals."}
{"text":"This place is located in the food court on the 2nd floor of the Pacific Mall. The ramyum was very good, though too salty near the bottom of the bowl. The beef japchae noodle soup was delicious! The california rolls were a miss though, as they seemed kind of stale. Keep in mind that this restaurant accepts cash only."}
{"text":"Located on the second level of Pacific Mall, near the back of the food court, this is your typical Japanese joint run by Chinese people.  I came here on a Sunday afternoon as I needed to buy something from Pacific Mall.  I wouldn't come to this place purposely for the sushi but it is a good option if you need a sushi fix.  This place has daily deals.  The Sunday deal is the Sushi Lunch, which added up to $10 with tax.  The Sushi Lunch came with miso soup, japchae, salad, and tea."}
{"text":"Food is decent but the person at the counter seems to be clueless. I'm waiting in line while a man finishes his order. I'm standing half a metre away from the counter next in line. I don't understand how a group of three manages to cut in front of me and the cashier takes their order before mine. Not sure how she did not see me as all she does is basically stand there..."}
{"text":"Love their takeout. It's the best. I love their yam maki!!!! Service is friendly.  Wait time is so short. I would come here more often but I avoid the parking !"}
{"text":"I think if you're craving sushi but don't want to dig too deep into your pocket, this is a good alternative. I got the sushi and Maki combo tonight and it was decent. Fish was ok but rice was a bit undercooked. You get what you pay for. I'd go again ."}
{"text":"3.5 decent sushi on the go.  no complaints not fancy smacy but averagely good.  nice to have some japanese sushi places in the mix of just chinese selection for varietys sake."}
{"text":"Nice Japanese food option at the Pacific Mall food court.  Ordered the #7 combo, salmon sashimi with rice, miso soup, hot tea, japchae, salad. $12 taxes in. Pretty good value.  Food quality was alright. Over-all pretty OK deal. They do have a raffle going on til September, make sure you add your entry!  They have a lot of meal options to choose from so would definitely try other items next time.  Review 89 of 100"}
{"text":"LET'S BE STRAIGHT UP HONEST RIGHT NOW- this is literally the only place I will eat in the food court. I don't like the pacific mall food court because it's so small and the chairs are stuck to the ground, and there are also too many disgusting people around. I don't like food courts at all. This place is pretty good and will always be my choice, if I don't choose to go to axia instead.   I always order the kalbi jap chae.. GOODNESS SAKES, have I made myself hungry while writing a 2am review again? Yes, Yes I have. The kalbi is so tasty while the jap chae is chewy and delicious. Beware, they do use thick jap chae, so if you're not into that.. don't get anything jap chae. I actually prefer it and I love thick noodles, so I'm 100% down for that, all the time. It's a nice, warm meal especially on a cold day.   The order usually doesn't take too long to make but carrying any soupy meals to your table just screams danger to me. & The little seating area they have at their own place is too small to hold a standard tray.. so I don't know how people even eat there?"}
{"text":"pretty nice place for some good ol' japanese and korean food  i highly recommend their beef bulgogi (patty form) BECAUSE WHOA MAMAMAA ITS SO GOOD like im not one to like meat that is drenched in sauce but THIS OO GORL I CAN TOLERATE THIS ITS THICK, IT JUICY , IT THE BOMB.COM (god damn it's like 1:34 am as im writing this and i just made myself hungry AF thinking about this beautiful piece of work OOOOoo) anyways yeah.. it isn't just meat, it comes with a salad (which i never usually eat because im not a fan of the salads they make), some japchae (meh could be better), i believe bean sprouts, miso soup, a cup of tea and some kimchi.   ***sidenotes: they used to use bento boxes for their food but now it's just those takeout boxes and i feel like their prices have raised which is a boohoo"}
{"text":"This place is in the upstairs foodcourt at Pacific Mall in Markham.  We ordered some sushi and a bowl of ramen noodles.  The sushi was OK, not great and was decent for the price.  However, the ramen was clearly instant noodles with some low quality ingredients mixed in... and IMO a complete rip off. Highly dissatisfied with it.  If you come, get some sushi but I'd avoid ramen."}
{"text":"Good mall food. Nice selection of Japanese/Korean cuisine. Bulgogi and kalbi are good meals. Pork and chicken katsu were weak. Don't bother with half the sides. Hot tea, miso soup, and salad with ginger dressing are bland fillers. The kim chi, rice, and japchae are good though. Average meal will run you $7-$8."}
{"text":"Got the daily special today, sushi mix set #6 (salmon, eel, octopus, imitation crab meat, shrimp, and yellowtail I believe). Price comes to exactly $10 with tax. Definitely not worth the price IMO. There's also miso soup, a cup of tea on the side as well as salad and some japchae (korean glass noodles). Fish slices are super thin and the eel was fishy. Salmon was pretty good and I had no issues with the rice. Wasabi was good. Didn't eat the pickled ginger since I normally don't lol (personally hate it). Might be worth trying something else here though."}
{"text":"They are now under new ownership as the owners are no longer Koreans but Chinese. Their price went up for a bit, but I guess when business dropped they also drastically dropped their cheap dishes' price. Their food are not crappy, but not outstanding either. Under the former owners, I loved their version of Chirashi, but I vowed to never order them again after feeling sick last time. I don't think they have enough orders to keep fresh fish, and they now use the sushi counter for bagging takeouts, so, I'd say it's safe to say anything have to do with sushi and sashimi is not recommended. Their rolls are still okay, though. What that also mean is that if you feel like sushi when you get here, you might want to head out toward Market Village to that AYCE place on the outside."}
{"text":"Great sushi and tempura, crappy teriaki"}
{"text":"Pacific Mall is a pilgrimage - a nightmare voyage by TTC so really only doable when I have a vehicle. So I visited yesterday for the first time in ages because I have a car. Why the hate Yelp? Yes maybe they are new owners, but the salmon sashimi bento was still the lovely fish adventure I remember so fondly! And the price was pretty much the same. And the people working there were super friendly!!! We were early for lunch so perhaps that is not indicative of regular service, but our lunch was delivered fast and fresh. I honestly enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"Japanese Express is found in the busy food court of Pacific Mall's second floor. Featuring a large selection of Japanese and Korean dishes, it's pretty amazing how they can maintain consistent quality of food across so much variety.  Today, I ordered the Kalbi Jap-Chai, which is rice noodles soup with beef short ribs. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the short ribs: juicy, tender, and large. The broth of the noodles was light but flavored just right, not too much that it overpowers the noodles. I really enjoyed the eggs mixed with the noodle, because the flavor pairs perfectly with the soup. However, the picture of the meal promised a bap-style egg, which the meal itself did not contain.  Their sushi selection is also very good. It's hard to trust sashimi at fast food sushi, but this venue seems to do it right. Try a plate of Salmon sashimi and tell me that you aren't impressed.   The prices are reasonable, mostly all under $12. Their rice dishes are very good for value, such as the bulgogi on rice.  The service was medium, food arrived fast, but they never mentioned that the plate of food was mine.  Overall, a great food venue in a food court filled with asian options, you can't go wrong with JE."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, always one of the tip choices in the food court. Didn't know when they started having daily specials but definitely a big bonus, can't say no to a good deal. Only complaint about this visit was the service. Waited at the counter for a while before anyone noticed and came over.  Presentation of the food is always nice, just like something served at a restaurant except on styrofoam containers. Noticed the wasabi they serve is very mild, had to use a lot to get a little spice. The amount of seafood served was good for the price, not thin pieces of fish. There was a good variety on the plate as well. Top notch Japanese food from a food court.  Overall, can't go wrong with good food and decent price. Only downside is finding a seat maybe a little difficult."}
{"text":"Great fresh sashimi, rolls and crispy tempura.  Some Korean food avail too.  Reasonable pricing for $10.  Always a line up but worth it.  Free tea and soup on your combs."}
