{"text":"decent food but not too friendly and they charge you what they want and not the price posted. They have a huge sign outside their store that plainly says any pita $5 and I went in Saturday around noon and was charged $11 for two and taxed for the over charge. Won't return!"}
{"text":"Food selection was good, but the pita was not served with enough meat in my opinion. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Over priced. Average taste, and less than average service and atmosphere... Don't waste your time..."}
