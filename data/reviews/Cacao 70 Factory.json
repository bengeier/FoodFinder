{"text":"This is the factory where you can see how the chocolate is made and taste some recipes created with the final product.

The pastry selection is not huge like the ones offered in industrialized places. However, if you are sick of the traditional danish donuts or double chocolate muffins, etc. this is the place to come.

For sure not all the food will be adequate to your particular taste. I recommend trying multiple courses and come back for more of the ones you like."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when this place opened up in my hood. It is pretty cool to see the chocolate making process in action. However,  the cafe side of the operation is a bit underwhelming.  The space is enormous and beautiful,  however all they offer is chocolate beverages, coffee, a small selection of pastries and they resell some Mandy's salads. 

We tried a couples the pastries and they were poor. I think they buy them elsewhere and just resell them. I also had a cold dark chocolate beverage which in fact was sort of mediocre. 

I really think that they missed an opportunity to offer a more elaborate menu of food. They certainly have enough space to prepare and serve and there are not a lot of other option in the immediate vicinity. 

As for the factory, it looks interesting and you can get a tour. However,  they charge you $15 / person for the pleasure.  We were a group of 5 so we passed on that and spent our dollars on brunch over on Center Street."}
{"text":"This Cacao 70 location is really much more of a Factory, thus the name. It's located in pointe-Charles not so far from the Charlevoix metro station. 

If you've always been curious about how the cocoa is being transformed to chocolate, then you really need to go there. All of their products are made on-site, so it's very interesting to look at. There's also a little cafe, I got there quickly during my lunch break and ordered the original hot chocolate which is absolutely delicious as well as a spinach pastry which tasted very good as well, all of their pastries are from Hof Kelsten so I kinda knew it would be awesome. They also have Mandy's salads for those who rather have a light lunch."}
