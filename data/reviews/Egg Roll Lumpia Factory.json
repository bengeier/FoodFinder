{"text":"Several years ago I had a renter who is Phillipino. Every so often, they cook Lumpia (phillipine verson of Chinese egg roll). It is home make style, it is dee -liceous. Since they move out, I sure missed Lumpia.

Three months ago, I by chance saw the sign 'LUMPIA factory', My mouth begin to watering. My thought was could it be my former renter?. I step inside, nop, they were phillipino...but not my former renter. I order several 'LUMPIA' it is just as good."}
{"text":"Being Filipino and having moved to Gilbert last year from Southern California, one of my first objectives was to find a Filipino food restaurant here in the valley. I found Lumpia Factory by accident by just exploring around Chandler one day. I found enough of the things I grew up eating (pancit, lumpia and adobo) and also tried some dishes that I heard about but never tried (menudo, which is way different than the mexican offering and apritada). It still isn't like what mom used to make, but what restaurant really does that. In a pinch, Lumpia Factory takes care of that craving I get for \"home cooking\"."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Filipino Restaurant in AZ.

There's nothing like coming here for lunch on the weekends.  They have a pretty extensive array of dishes available on Saturday and Sunday.  

I really have to stay disciplined when I come here, because I always feel like ordering one of everything.  

Their lechon is pretty damn tasty.  I have ordered lechon from them for holiday parties, and family members usually rave about how good it is.

When there's a \"pot luck\" type party at my wife's work, she usually orders 100 pieces of pork lumpia from here, and it is always the first item that runs out.  

If you're craving Filipino food.  You have to pay a visit to Gene at Lumpia Factory."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Can anyone confirm that it actually closed down?"}
{"text":"I drove past this place quite a few times, making a mental note of it but didn't venture to go inside until a few months ago. The guy who typically works there is mostly friendly though he takes a little while to warm up to you. The ladies who work there usually can't take their eyes off of the tv long enough to actually look at you, but oh well.  Previous to going here, I hadn't had much exposure to Filipino food. Most of it is pretty good, though there are a few dishes that weren't quite what I expected. Overall, the dishes seem to be a little on the oily side...I'm not sure if this is typical of Filipino food or if its just this place. My favorite thing about this place is the lumpia, which at 4 for $1 are a pretty good deal. Surprisingly, their sweet and sour sauce is amazing. Also, on weekends they have this roast pork that is freaking amazing. 

All in all, its worth trying it out at least. Make sure you bring cash though, because they dont take plastic."}
{"text":"This place has the personal touch I like.  The guy remembered me from 2007 and 8/08.  Unfortunately they didn't have Pancit today but I got some sinigang and ate it on the spot.

{"text":"I miss Manila Café from the early 2000s, the little Filipino joint that used to be at this location, a little pocket nudged into the strip mall on the southwest corner of Alma School and Elliot. I love lumpia, though--the Filipino version of the egg roll, its biggest difference coming from the thin, crisp wrapper as contrasted to the thick, doughy wrappers used with Americanized Chinese egg rolls. Thus, it was easy to be drawn to Manila Café's replacement. 

For a place called the Lumpia Factory, though, the lumpia pickings are usually sparse when I'm there, and those that I've had, aren't quite my style--cigarillo-thin and filled only with meat, they left me yearning for Mom's big fat lumpia, elegant, ample, savory, and home. That aside, the food here can be pretty good! 

Shove some storage boxes aside, shift the somewhat awkward and somewhat heavy tables and chairs so you can actually sit at them without having to be as thin as a stick figure (they don't mind that their clientele shifts tables and chairs around to suit their parties, which is usually families of various sizes), then step up to the hot plates nestled into the steam table to see the 8-10 dishes offered on that day's menu--it changes daily, but is usually the same from week to week. Whoever I've run into, manning the counter, has been polite, downright friendly, and eager to please (and answer any questions, for those of you novices). Point through the glass at what will usually be stewing meats or soups, braised meats and vegetables, sometimes unusual parts of common animals (tripe anyone?), and set up your plate--a combo with two or three items with a serving of rice--and the counter help will bring it to you in Styrofoam plates and bowls. 

If you're Filipino or have affection for the cuisine, chances are, your pick will hit the spot, or at least come close. Of course, if you're like me and compare the food to mom's cooking, you're bound to find something to take issue with, but if you enjoy it for what it is--home-style comfort food from a culture whose food is far too ignored and, therefore, hard to come by, then you'll be pleased and maybe even get all nostalgic. 

If you're new to Filipino food, you can start easy with one of their adobo dishes, lumpia, and a pancit dish, which is the Filipino equivalent of Chinese lo mein--you can't go wrong with noodles! No matter who you are, try halo-halo for dessert--this is at the heart of Filipino desserts!"}
{"text":"I used to be a frequent visitor here when this venue first opened somewhere around 2005, and Shirley was the cook/manager.  She initially started this Filipino eggroll (lumpia) catering business with a partner who decided to move on and leave Shirley to her own devices.  She expanded her business to include a few popular items she'd freshly prepare, rather than serve it buffet-style.  This ensured that the food was low in fat, but high in flavor!  I remember buying fresh pan de sal and baked chicken empanadas.  How I do miss Shirley and her way of doing business.

The new owners (as of 2006), a husband and wife team, do serve tasty dishes.  At least they used to.  It's been over a year since I've last eaten there.  Do go as early in the day as possible to be sure to get the freshest meals.  If you are looking for bargains, do visit before they close, but keep in mind that many items may already be overcooked from sitting under heating lamps/over heating elements.  The meals here are very greasy, but that's pretty much standard about meals served buffet-style (the fat keeps the food from burning).  I used to enjoy the afritada, menudo, and Bicol express.  The lumpia is pretty good, but only if very fresh (that may be more of a personal choice, since I have encountered many people who do not mind eating horrible, soggy pathetic excuses of lumpia).    

One can also find desserts, such as halo-halo, biko, and turon."}
{"text":"So...another Filipino restaurant casualty.  I saw they had closed some time earlier this year.  Very sad, as with Karey's Kitchen, the people were very cool."}
{"text":"I had a bad lumpia experience at this place. I went there since I had a huge craving for some authentic lumpia and I ordered the pork lumpia. It tasted freezer burned and the edges were burnt where the meat was busting out. My friend calls this kind of lumpia \"lazy ass lumpia\" cuz the edges are open faced and not enclosed....hahahahaa. Anyhow I might give this place a 2nd try if I'm ever in the neighborhood but highly doubt it."}
