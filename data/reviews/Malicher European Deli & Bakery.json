{"text":"Malicher Magnificent - Everything I've had at this bakery is wonderful. Every visit is like a treasure hunt, there's always something yumma awaiting discovery. The Eastern European couple that run the bakery are so sweet, kind, & hard working. It's so delightful & refreshing to find a bakery that actually prepares the goods like you'd find in Europe. No over sugared refined flour mass produced stuff here. I recently ordered a cake for a good friend's birthday, the couple called it a Shaggy Hat (it was covered in chocolate curls), decadent chocolate ecstasy! The pizza, rum balls, pecan squares, croissants, truffles, are phenomenal. In fact, everything is great. If you enjoy your leavened loaf, you must try the Bossman bread, so goood. If you enjoy eating well, you must try Malicher!"}
{"text":"HILLHURST SUNNYSIDE HAS A BAKERY! HOORAY!       Spread the word, Malicher's is good enough to be a daily experience. They have a lot of peripheral yumminess, but start with the heart of the bakery. Awesome Russian bread, excellent sourdough. Criss croissants and buns. The family definitely understands that bread is the point, and all the other stuff is a celebration of eating. I'm not a big fan of sweets, but Malicher's has them in spades. What I do love is savoury, and they do it well. The sausage potato pie is amazing. The locally done Hungarian sausage and langos has added 5 pounds to me this year. If you live in the 'hood, I recommend checking them out for all you 'munchy' needs. P.S. if you don't like dense moist rye, go with their Russian black. I like their rye bricks, but a friend of mine didn't as he prefers them less dense and less moist. Enjoy."}
{"text":"This is a small bakery (loaves of bread, desserts, etc.) that also serves things like sandwiches and soups to take away at lunch time.  I'm not sure, but I get the feeling that the people working there were the people who own it and do all the food preparation, a super friendly older man and woman.  I like mom and pop shops.  At first I was worried because the sandwich I got was wrapped in plastic and sitting in a case, but both the bread and the fillings were really fresh and delicious.  So were the shortbread chocolate cookie and the soup, which had a nice homemade feel to it.  Next time I'm going to try the cinnamon buns."}
