{"text":"We used to go to the Ohio when it was the divey-est of dive bars. It's turned into a more upscale, hipster style joint (as much of the east side has...). The tacos are amazing, as is the corn. We went on a Friday night & it was PACKED. Not recommended if you hope to have any meaningful conversations. But, good food, trendy decor."}
{"text":"I was told that the seat I had chosen was haunted. Sadly, it turns out, it was not, as promised, haunted. Comfy and well placed, but nary a spectral event or even the slightest whisper of a \"boo\" in my ears. However....the tacos are delish and the overall vibe is excellent. Will return to induce fullness on tacos/beer as well as investigating the haunted chair more."}
{"text":"Bulldoze this place!  It's filthy...don't sit on anything.  Terrible service.  Actually no service.  We left after 20 minutes without so much as a glance from the staff.  It was nearly empty...easy to see why.  1. Dead 2. Over priced drinks 3. Disgusting bathrooms 4. The pool table is devoid of basic pool etiquette 5. Disappointing deals considering Madison is a college town 6. Bartenders are rude 7. This place is just dirty.   Their so called \"Wing\" night....what a joke for .25 you get small wings that look like the chicken were diseased and on their death bed or they might just be baby rats."}
{"text":"Great tacos, but the street corn was awesome.  Small establishment with very little seating, but a cool vibe.  Really need to expand or create an outdoor seating area to maximize this hidden gem that sits right on the bike path.  Experienced the PBR taco and it was placed in a corn tortilla and filled sufficiently.  Great taste and textures.  Also had the Kona corn and it was a hit.  Loved the flavors that came thru.  Definitely another trip on tap, but maybe for takeout."}
{"text":"Great unique tacos, and laid back place that fits the vibe of the neighborhood. However, there isn't much seating for how popular this is (a few first come first served tables and a bar). We went on a Wednesday night around 8 pm and had to wait about 10-15 minutes to get 2 seats at the bar. Definitely worth trying if you are prepared to wait a bit."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday tour with friends & we were so pleasantly amazed. The tacos were a bit dry but the corn OMG delicious!!! The staff was incredibly attentive & very friendly. A highly recommended establishment. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Superb in every way. This is how a neighbor Tavern is done. Excellent atmosphere, great drinks, fantastic food, reasonable prices, & pretty unparalleled service. The only issue is that they aren't closer to my home, & that's not really their fault. They make it seem so easy, but apparently they have a formula that can't easily be replicated. Keep it up! Don't you go-a-changin'."}
{"text":"This is what a bar looks like when a hipster hangout and a dive bar have a baby.  I liked the ambience and the beer selection. I noticed they had a really limited menu full of mostly tacos, so I took advantage of the happy hour special and had 3 different soft shell tacos. Each had a distinct, pleasant flavor but were dry. I think they do that on purpose so that you try out their 8 proprietary sauces. The sauces make the tacos taste like tacos. Not authentic Mexican food, but good.  The bartender was very friendly. There are no waitstaff and you have to place all your orders at the bar. It is a perfect place for the lumbersexual, Prius-driving set. I will be sure to wear my beanie and my best buffalo plaid shirt when I go there next."}
{"text":"My favorite taco/karaoke/bad movie bar hands down. Here's a list of all the pros:  1) Rotating taco special. I haven't had a taco there I didn't like and the hummus taco last Saturday was ESPECIALLY good with the pickled vegetables.   2) Karaoke on Saturday nights! The guy who runs karaoke has a great selection, remembers the regulars and takes suggestions on additions to the books. The regulars at karaoke are also great and will help make you feel more comfortable participating  3) The bartenders/bar. Large beer selection that has some good rotations. Bartenders that know how to make a goddamn drink, like a Sazurac! (If you like Absinthe, try this drink).   Ohio is cash only, but they have an ATM with a pretty low fee. For late-night tacos, happy hour, or Saturday night karaoke, check out Ohio!"}
{"text":"Some of the other reviews knock the tacos at the Ohio but I thought they were amazing. I went with a group of four and our plan was to try to get a table at the Ohio but then go over to Tex Tubbs if it was too packed. I'm so glad we were able to get a table and stay for food. My favorite taco was the classic and the diablo corn was perfect, I love heat and the Ohio knows how to do it right."}
{"text":"Got to give this place a 5 star rating for 4 reasons. We stopped in for a beer while riding along the nearby bike path and found: 1. 2.75 beers 2. FREE BRATS & ITALIAN SAUSAGES 3. Free shots of mcgillicuddy's every time the Packers get a TD 4. Friendly service.   What else do you want? !"}
{"text":"Love this bar! Great bartenders, fun clientele! My favorite place to hang out!"}
{"text":"I've read about the Ohio Tavern. Old local hang-out bar turned taco-haven with good drinks and amazing tacos, tamales, and corn (or elotes). We finally stopped by after work tonight (because who doesn't want a good taco on a cold evening), and it lived up to all the hype. 3 tacos for $11 or 1 for $4, the G-man and I each had three. The old boy - carnitas, rice, kimchi, bacon, and charred scallion dressing - was a great pop of umami flavor. Each bite was perfect and the balance between the pork, rice, and kimchi was superb. The bacon add a great burst of flavor. The Belmont was beef brisket with picante slaw, jalape√±o and a blueberry habanero \"awesome sauce.\" This one had a kick, and the blueberry habanero sauce had a vinegary, sweet bite. Yum! The last was my favorite - - it was their special taco which was a beef heart taco and I didn't catch the full description but it was sublime. I had a tap Paloma that had a smokey tequila and complimented the tacos so well. We got there early and were glad we did as it filled up quickly even on a cold Tuesday evening. Que bueno! Gracias, al Ohio Tavern por la comida tan fabulosa!"}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday night not realizing there is karaoke ever Saturday at 8. The singing? was good but pretty loud. The tacos are very good and cheap at 3 for $11 and there is an amazing select of hot sauces."}
{"text":"It's hard to complain about my visit - we got the best seat in the house on a sunny day and their taco special was delicious!  We just stopped for a second for a taco and a cocktail - I think pretty much every taco was $4 a pop and it's a cash bar - major upgrade from the Ohio when I lived in the area. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Lifelong Madisonian, first time Ohio Tavernian. Had 3 tacos (carnitas, lamb and chicken) along with the street corn, tried to save some for next-day lunch--could not do it. So flippin' good! The bartender was super friendly and helpful, the beer was delish, the cook was amazing and the young man taking our empty plates was so sweet. Couldn't stick around for the music, but the warm up had a great feel. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love the Ohio Tavern - heard a lot about how good the tacos are.  But frankly, I've had much better tacos...pretty much everywhere else.  And for half the price.  I had the classic carnitas.  $4 is steep for a taco with very little filling.  I like my carnitas to have crispy bits; this was just like moist cooked pork.  And the taco simply didn't have a lot of flavor, even with he addition of several of the bottles sauces provided. I did enjoy the house street corn, which included crispy pieces of bacon. Service was pretty slow and the space is loud. I wish they had outdoor seating. I will give the Ohio another chance, and try some different taco versions."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos!! Love that the menu is concise and simple. Was visiting from out of town, found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. I like the pay as you go service (cash only). This is a small, dive bar and because of this the noise carries. Will be back next time I am in Madison!"}
{"text":"This place is not a \"let's start a pub crawl here because it's kind of cool\" townie bar, it's a \"this is so depressing that I want to leave\" townie bar.  Proceed at your own risk..."}
{"text":"Amazing low key bar. Cash only but they have an ATM. Got an assortment of tacos. Two chicken and one carnitas::::amazing. Go get tacos now from them!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Tacos! You ever go to a place and wonder how you haven't heard of it before? This is it. Amazing tacos, every one of them. We tried 6 different ones and each was tasty and individual. Overall a great scene. Cash only and tables are first come first serve. But the food is amazing and they have a great selection of beers on tap and in bottles."}
{"text":"I've heard Toto's Africa twice in an hour.  Decent tacos but this injustice shall not stand."}
{"text":"I don't even want to write a review because I don't want this hidden gem to get too crowded on me. This is everything you want out of a dive bar with amazing food. It's chaotic, busy, friendly and the food is fantastic. They also have homemade hot sauce and they put bacon in EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"I love the Ohio.  It's the kind of hellhole where you can watch a prostitute sing \"like a virgin\" on karaoke night, and see old dudes in satin jackets with bar logos on them get in fights.  Classy."}
{"text":"Ah, yes.  The site of where one of my profile pictures was taken.  I could not resist the allure of a bar that had a giant neon \"Drink Blatz\" sign hanging above the door.  I am, after all, a Wisconsin girl.  The boy and I went on some random weekday night in the winter.  It was a very large, divey, unattractive hole-in-the-wall as you would correctly surmise from the Blatz sign.  Fortunately, I love townie dive bars, and therefore, was comfortable with this.  We each ordered a beer on tap from the nice, older lady who was bartending, (PBR and Leinie's, if I remember correctly) and paid something like $3 total.  Sexy.  Very sexy.  As we drank our beers, we decided to arm wrestle.  The bartender was going outside for a smoke and cheered me on.  My back was to her, but my boyfriend told me that she mouthed the words \"Let her win\" to him.  Haha!  She came back later to see if I'd won or not.  :)  I need to go back post haste!"}
{"text":"Super divey, super friendly, and in a super hip neighborhood. They were having a special on the tacos that night, and though I'm not the first one to jump at the opportunity to taco, the Vegan Tacos caught my eye. Lentils, pickled red onion, red cabbage, corn and salsa verde for the win! I love that they put a *successful* spin on a Mexican classic. I was not disappointed - they were tasty, indeed!   Life hack: Margaritas are vegan. Don't be afraid to pair one with the 3 for $11 special! lol"}
{"text":"I love the remodel of this place with the small, cozy vibe. They have done a fabulous job on injecting life and fun into an old and tired bar. The Ohio Tavern is a sweet and happenin' hangout. The beer menu is decent and tacos start at 4PM. The bartenders are friendly and welcoming and the crowd is just plain nice! The El Baja is amaaaaazing! I would be happy only getting this one, however, my companions are all over the PBR, Classic and Belmont. I recently tried the Blackened Catfish and was pleasantly surprised, but really?? They only make REALLY GOOD TACOS here, so, I should've known better. They take only cash, but do have an ATM on site. And best of all, this place is an easy stop off of the Capital City Bike Trial!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday, first visit. Enjoyed a Tallgrass Key Lime Pie Sour Blonde on tap. Tasty and tart. Wished it had been 4pm so we could try out the tacos, the menu looked outstanding. Loved the open window overlooking the street. Perfect place to spend some time. Nice bartender, too. Check it out."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and tamales! The drinks were great. The renovations inside also look very nice."}
{"text":"This place used to be a shabby and seedy bar and not in a good way. The new owners have transformed it into a stylish yet cozy neighborhood hangout, featuring out-of-this world tacos, rotating craft beers and a glass garage door for an indoor/outdoor summer experience. It's my new favorite place in Madison."}
{"text":"I can't ask for much more in a small bar than friendly service, inexpensive drinks, and positive atmosphere. That's what you get at the Ohio, with really fun karaoke dj's and regulars, too!"}
{"text":"Tacos good. Corn not good. Only take cash, no cards. Friendly staff.  Karaoke staff are nice, but you must be a local and regular to sing. If not, prepare to wait.  Tipped the karaoke hostess generously, waited an hour, still had not been called to sing although many of the happy drunks slurred MULTIPLE songs each, just because they were a regular.  Visiting a family member, we are from out of state, ended up tipping and waiting for no good reason. Never was called after waiting over an hour, watching the same people over and over again, so we left."}
{"text":"I visited the newly reopened Ohio Tavern for happy hour after work on Friday. The bar has recently undergone a remodel, and the owners did a great job of keeping the old charm (jukebox, back bar, tile inlay) while spiffing the place up. They have a limited menu - tacos and street corn - but the food is delish. I read that they partnered with the team from Underground Butcher on the menu, and the ingredients were certainly fresh. One taco is $3.50 and is generously stuffed. Our tacos were accompanied with what else but a well muddled Old Fashioned. Bartenders were friendly and service was prompt. The crowd grew steadily while we were there, and by the time we left around 6, all the tables and barstool last were occupied. I will definitely return as this place is a nice compliment to other great bars in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The bar itself is ok, cheap drinks and that kind of townie atmosphere that you need sometimes when you feel down on your luck. Plus singing karaoke with an Elvis impressionist makes for an impressive, different kind of evening! (He doens't do 60's Elvis by the way) The large Blatz sign out front is their calling card and the drink is always cold. So prepare for your hangover tomorrow, cause for $20 you'll get tore up!"}
{"text":"This place SUCKS!  Every time I go in here it depresses the shit out of me.  People say it's haunted and I would agree - haunted by degenerates and meth heads.  I always say I'll never go back but that never happens..."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this place is great. The bartender is so sweet and remembered my friends' names when they walked in. The pbr was cheap, delicious, and cold. Exactly the type of bar I want to sit and have a beer and make friends with at."}
{"text":"I stopped in to check out the newly redone Ohio Tavern tonight for their taco special. Although I'd never been there before the redo, it definitely doesn't read as any kind of 'new'. Dark and divey, loud but good music via the jukebox, the back bar wood seemingly coated in the grunge of its many years of service without having been touched. The bartenders are great, enthusiastic and accomodating.  The tap list is adequate, and the bottled beer selection is better. I found parking and a seat at the bar easily, even though the place was about 3/4 full on an early Friday evening. A chalkboard displays the special taco of the day, and a paper menu describes the others. I went for the three taco special for $10, a lamb barbacoa, a shredded chicken, and a carnitas. All three had good flavor but were uniformly lacking in moisture. Really dried out. I asked for and received a bit more sauce on the side, which helped a little. Don't come expecting El Grito level tacos, nor Tex Tubbs. They are merely serviceable, but the bar has been set much higher locally of late. Nowhere to go but up in the food department.  All in all, it's a gritty yet comfortable place to stop in, the service is fast and friendly, prices are low, and I'll go back. Maybe if only to catch a glimpse of the rumored ghost."}
{"text":"What a cute little hidden gem! Came here on a Saturday night. From the outside it does not look like much but it sure was busy on the inside. One of my friends had heard good things about the tacos and we wanted to try it out.   They are cash only and have an atm onsite. The atm does have a fee so be prepared before with cash if you do not want to pay this fee. The service was friendly and drinks were nicely priced.   They have a limited taco and street corn menu that is served until 12:00am. We tried one of the chicken tacos and some spicy Mexican street corn.  I was very impressed with both, they tasted fresh and had good flavor.   As a bar this place is cute and they have karaoke on Saturdays. The tacos are just the frosting on the cake for this place. I would come back here to try the different tacos and for the moderately priced drinks as well."}
{"text":"The renovations are a welcome improvement to this establishment. The drinks have a great pour and the service is exceptional.   We definitely indulged in some tacos and they were delicious. Lots of unique flavors and combinations. I will definitely be back to try more options. The \"build your own\" menu was almost overwhelming, however, a friendly patron recommended the Santa Barbara taco and it did not disappoint!  They have a large selection of craft cocktails (only $5-$6) and everything else is more than reasonably priced. My companion had a whiskey sour that was actually mixed on the spot and shaken - none of that just add \"squirt\" to a glass nonsense.   Seriously, if you had reservations about visiting this place before, put them aside and enjoy a taco, a great drink, and good people!"}
{"text":"The best tacos in Madison, hands down. Love love love this place! Excellent variety, good beer and cocktails! I recommend to all my friends, good people, good vibes."}
{"text":"First of all, this is NOT a dive bar any longer. I was a regular at the Ohio for 3 years when I lived in the Atwood neighborhood. It was definitely a dive bar where all the locals could hang out, have pot lucks, play pool, etc. I even threw a few parties there.   When we found out it had been sold we were very skeptical to say the least.  The \"new\" Ohio is, as I rated, OK. The tamales are absolutely disgusting. Do not order them. Ever. The bread is mush and the filling is bland. The tacos however are quite delicious. I've only tried two of them, one was when they were testing them out back when they first opened, and the other was last night. Both were incredibly tasty and filling. Mind you, I don't even really like tacos so that's saying a lot.  The atmosphere is hit or miss here for me. Sometimes it's warm and inviting, sometimes is hoity-toity and WAY too hipster (ok to be honest it's usually too hipster), sometimes it's the most boring place imaginable. I have had some really fun nights here though, just depends on the type of clientele hanging out that night. But like I said, more times than not it's super white and super yuppie.   The juke box is terrible. Unless you like pretentious hipster music, then you'd love it. The drink selection is fine and they still serve the classic Blatz beer.  The old O used to sell it for $2 a bottle, now they sell it for $2.50 a bottle. I appreciate their effort to keep the bar's signature beer cheap.  I've loved this bar for a long time and it was a home away from home for me, so I may be more harsh than others. I do love the interior. The big windows (don't worry, there's a hipster garage door they open) really help it feel less like a dark hole in the wall. I'm also a HUGE fan of dim lighting. The darker the better. You can barely see your glass in this place and I appreciate that.  Most of the bartenders are pretty all right. Service is again, hit or miss. Sometimes you'll get someone awesome, sometimes you'll get ignored for 20 minutes. The gentrification of my beloved neighborhood has been difficult to deal with and losing my favorite spot where I always felt comfortable was sad, but at least something terrible didn't take it over. Just something... meh. Also, I wish they had something to do! A pool table, dart board, board games, literally ANYTHING would be an improvement.  I've mostly avoided the new Ohio for awhile and am now trying to give it another chance. So far, still just OK to me. I will continue to go because I really like their champagne and I will update as needed."}
{"text":"What's not to love? Great atmosphere, awesome beer selection and some of the most delicious, unique tacos you'll find in Madison. A great place to have a fun, laid back night. I like to get the 3 tacos for $11 and try 3 different ones; even better if you are going with a group and you can try every one on the menu (although I'm sure the kitchen staff don't love that, sorry! I'll make sure to tip well!). So if you haven't checked this place out yet, what are you waiting for!"}
{"text":"Incredible tacos. I would usually tell people to hit up el grito but damn! These are amazing! Cant wait to go back and try different ones!"}
{"text":"Very good vegetarian tacos, though a little less so now that they have gotten rid of the mushroom one. Also great Mexican street corn (served more as a casserole, not on the cob). Loud, dive-y environment. Will do take out. Solid neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! They always have a solid beer selection. I tried their sweet corn for the first time. This was a great little snack. The sauce & fresh veggies they add are great. The corn itself comes off the cob, in a bowl. So there's no mess or corn stuck in your teeth after. I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"Second best tacos in Madison after canteen. Limited selection, but they do it all good. Their claim to fame is their selection of eclectic sauces, which include plantain poblano, three pepper among other ones. Mind you they only have tacos, and of you're interested in the local karaoke scene, this tavern might surprise you with how many good singers seem to love in this quaint neighborhood."}
{"text":"I want to love the new Ohio. I've been in for drinks a couple times now. Decent. The remodel is great. Very hip, very chic.  My beef with the O is that I have been in 2 times now (once on a Sunday afternoon, and again tonight on a Tuesday evening) with a strong hankering for some tamales (I've heard they're good) but both times I've had to turn around and leave.   Not a single seat at the bar. Not a single open table. Nothing.   Tonight there was a chic holding down a 4-top all to herself. Ruuude.   Maybe some 2-tops, or a counter along the back wall would help, but either way, it's frustrating to say the least.   I get it - it's a small place, but there is something to be said about efficient space utilization. Figure it out, guys!"}
