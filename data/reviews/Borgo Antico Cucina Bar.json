{"text":"I want to love this restaurant.  The Italian food was great, the service excellent but newly-opened Borgo Antico needs some fixes to make me want to return.
With this lovely location, it would be worth investing in textile baffles, soft wall panels and furnishings to improve the acoustics.  We had to converse in really loud voices to overcome noise echoing around the space.
While we were happy with the food, which was nicely prepared, and fairly priced, the wine list was too ambitious.  Many wines, but very few that were moderately priced.  Some wine options in the more reasonable price range would be appreciated."}
{"text":"Walked in with friends by coincidence. This is authentic italian food, very well prepared and I would go back there anytime. All seems to be homemade and fresh. Both the pasta dishes and the seafood dishes we had where just delicious! And very nicely presented as well. Surprising value for money. Real italian coffee! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"OVERCHARGED 3 times and still NO REFUND

I'll be happy to change my review once Borgo Antico Management keeps their word on their refund and promise.

Here's the scoop:
My friend and I had a mini-reunion on Thursday, December 7, 2017 at this restaurant. We asked the owner how much the fish was. He answered $34. That evening, we shared the octopus appetizer and ordered a $34 fish each. After the meal, the owner came by our table to process our payments separately. He read my total out loud on the bill but added $10 more on the terminal. When he handed me the terminal, the screen only showed the gratuity portion which I happily pressed 15% at the time. I returned to the restaurant later that night to discuss the overcharged amount. He did not refund me the amount and charge me the new total, but altered the price on his iPad and printed me a new receipt. He took my original receipt and wrote VOID across it. After I took the toll route home, I checked the credit card online and it read PENDING. 

On Sunday December 17, 2017, I was informed that the overcharged dinner bill went through on my credit card of $73.23.

Within the elapsed time of 10 days, my dinner guest confided in me that the owner overcharged him for his fish. I double checked my dinner bill and I discovered the owner overcharged me for my fish too!

Initially, I thought this was an honest mistake. I sent an email to the owner. I added that I looked forward to a memorable night, but after realizing we were overcharged three times, \"we left with regret in our hearts\". I received an email the same week with an apology. However, he mansplained that we didn't hear him correctly about the price of the fish and it was another \"honest mistake\".

I am keeping an open mind and an open heart about these mounting \"honest mistakes\". However, I am beginning to wonder if other people have been taken advantage by his \"honest mistakes\" as more time passes."}
{"text":"The most amazing Italian restaurant I've been outside of Italy. We stumbled upon this place while strolling around downtown Oakville, saw that the restaurant was quite full so decided to give it a try. We ordered the pappardelle funghi and the linguine mare, and when the grandpa came to serve the pasta he said \"best pappardelle you'll ever have\".....and he was right!! The porcini mushrooms were so flavourful and taste is bang on. The linguine mare was great too. We also had the calamari appetizer which was generous in proportions and lightly battered with home made aioli. The free bread and chickpea dip, oh the chickpea dip! Soooo good. Lastly, the service was amazing. We had a stroller with us, which they were able to accommodate and gave us a fairly private area so we can breastfeed too. Will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"The bf and I decided to check the place out based on a recommendation from a friend.

First off, this place does pasta right. They use traditional Italian recipes that taste absolutely delicious - the right mix between homey Italian and great restaurant food. I'd say that it's a great date night restaurant - it's classy but fairly casual dress. You have the option to sit on the patio (great for summer nights,) or inside where it's a little quieter.

We decided to skip out on appetizers and go straight for the main course. While we waited, our waiter brought us some bread and the most amazing chickpea dip (almost like hummus texture.) The bread was so light and delicious I could have inhaled the entire bag, however I really had to restrain myself in order to save room for the main course.

I had the linguine mare - a seafood linguine with snow crab, mussels, shrimp, octopus, clams, grape tomatoes and fresh pasta made in house. It comes in at a pricey $28, but it comes packed with delicious seafood! The noodles were perfectly al dente. The bf had the spaghetti bolognese that had the most wonderful sauce, and I can safely say we were stealing from each others plates during the night.

TLDR; Great ambiance, great food, great service, all around winner. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great service, very authentic Italian. Food seemed great but couldn't eat much due to lack of vegetarian choices."}
{"text":"A great addition to Downtown Oakville. My husband and I went here for dinner and loved it. The owners are super friendly and helpful. Food was DELISH! We had fried calamari and shrimp as an app- the calamari was so meaty we loved it and ordered a second order of that! Our dinner took a bit longer to prepare I assume it was being cooked super fresh! The veal shanks were absolutely amazing. They were super tender. Seafood risotto was also great, generous with the seafood they put in it. I loved it:) would definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"It was a wonderful experience from beginning to end. The people who work there are nothing less than exceptional and the food will definitely keep you coming back. Thank you so much! We will see you again soon"}
{"text":"Delicious food, simple menu, very nice service and owner, cute patio on lakeshore and nice room inside suitable for groups. Classic Italian restaurant that offers all kinds of pasta, antipasti and salads as well as some delicious charcuterie and fine cocktails. I highly recommend to try the endive salad as an appetizer and the simple spaghetti with tomato sauce as an entree. You can also share the cheese and crudo plate with two or more people."}
