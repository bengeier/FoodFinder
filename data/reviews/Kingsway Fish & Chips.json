{"text":"Kingsway is the go to spot in Toronto for Fish n Chips in my opinion. It is by far my favourite fish n chip spot, I've been going for years now and I highly reccomend it. The breading on the chips is unbeatable with a perfect golden flakey goodness. The halibut they serve is also top notch. Fries are of course amazing, take-out is served in newspaper which is of course necessary. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very home timey and service has always been great in my opinion. Don't be fooled, if you are looking for Fish n Chips GO HERE! You won't be dissapointed I promise."}
{"text":"This is the most popular fish and chips place in Etobicoke. And once you try the halibut fish and chips you understand why. The fish is tasty and generous and batter crispy and perfect. The chips are very good too. I have been coming here for over 10 years and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my Uncle here yesterday.  It wasn't very busy, perhaps of the holiday season.  We ordered the halibut fish & chips.  The fish was done perfectly and was not greasy.  The texture of the fish meat was firm and flavourful.  No fishy taste.  Have tried many places, including restaurants in London, UK, and this is definitely one of the best places for fish & chips.  Restaurant staff were very friendly & attentive."}
{"text":"Food was great and so was the price.  The only problem was they don't have pictures on the menu.  I would definetly eat there again."}
{"text":"Why oh why do people rave about this place? Why does the media use it for Good Friday filler? It is overpriced. The fish is undercooked. The chips are way overcooked; I was told the chips were fresh/not frozen, and I did not see any evidence of this, especially in the taste and consistency (they were tasteless and grainy). Over half were inedible. The portions are small.  I was charged $1 for a tiny side of mayo (and wasn't told this would be extra). The menu is inconsistent and confusing (Full size, half size or \"a few\" are not accordingly described, provided or priced).  The atmosphere/ambiance is strongly convalescent home bordering on funereal.  The service (three staff that interacted with me) was perfunctory. FYI, it is a sit-down restaurant and not diner-style; perhaps they feel this allows for the over-pricing."}
{"text":"Some of the best fish and chips in the west end can be found here. Even though they have a reasonably big dining area, Kingsway Fish & Chips does a pretty brisk business in take-out, and there's space to hang around while waiting for your order.   In fact, most of the time I'm here, I get it to go--somehow fish and chips is just better unwrapped out of greasy newspaper than off a plate. The only downside is that there's always a bit of a wait, since it's quite popular.  Kingsway Fish & Chips is right in the middle of their fiftieth anniversary, so they have extra specials and giveaways on right now through mid-September. Yeah, I'm starting to sound like a bad commercial, but they're definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"A place doesn't last 30+ years if it isn't good.  The fish and chips are excellent quality,and they use halibut fish, which I like.  They have extras like mushy peas which make for an authentic UK style chippy experience.  Homemade fries are yummy.  I like their homemade rice pudding for dessert as well, it's very old school but suits the place.  Well worth the trip.  Family oriented establishment, you'll see babies and seniors alike.  Hours are limited, check before you go.  Crazy busy on Good Friday.  If you're doing take out, call in your order to avoid the line up."}
{"text":"If you have any Brit or Irish blood in you at all, fish and chips is something you shouldn't mess with.   Kingsway has been doing it right since they opened their doors. Whether you're looking for a Scottish meat pie, Irn Bru, or the delicacy of halibut and chips - you'll never go wrong at this fish shop.   The service is rapid and friendly. The food always fresh and hot - made to order and no heat lamps. The ambiance is typical of a fish and chip shop - you'll love the teapot collection.   It is a bit on the pricey side. There's no denying that, but it's better than any other fish shop in Toronto's west district. Forget what they say about McNees. They don't hold a candle to Kingsway."}
{"text":"We decided to stop here to pick up 4 meals to take home (live 2 minutes away). It was 2pm on a Thursday, the actual seating area was quiet but it still took over 20 minutes to get the food (4 portions of chips, 1 fish, chicken fingers, meat pie) I can honestly say being British this food was rank..disgusting and plain awful. The chips were NOT fresh refried at least 2 times before, the fish was cold and had a bones in it, the meat pie just had no taste and was hard as a brick and the chickens breading was so hard it almost broke teeth. This place has only survived because most people around bloor area have most probably not had real English fish and chips. A real English chippy don't sell haggis or black pudding! Because they only need to be great at 1 thing chips, so incorporating more to an already crap menu they hope to nail at least 1 thing. Trust me there are so many other places THIS place has crap food, tasteless, multiple frying, hard as nails and such long wait time for garbage. Although no one actually finished there food my mum got sick right after and rushed to the bathroom and had to lay down for 2 hours after. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"The best fish and chips I've ever had in my life great speedy service wish there was more salad selections though and reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Good fish and chips! Crispy and yet not greasy, unlike other restaurants !! Friendly staffs and reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Having grown up in the east end, I was raised on Duckworth's - definitely one of the best options for fish & chips in the city.  Now, living in the West end, I've been in search of the best local equivalent.    Kingsway Fish & Chips is definitely comparable!   The age, decor, and stellar food are all reminiscent of my favourite place in the east.   We ate in, which I don't normally do with fish & chips, but upon arriving, we noticed the decor was clean (albeit dated), the place was busy (a good sign), and the service was friendly and efficient.  The staff seemed to genuinely care whether we'd enjoyed our meal, and were attentive throughout too.  The fish batter is fluffy and crispy and delicious (but as far as greasiness goes, this is high up in the rankings!).  The chips were also fresh, nicely well-done and tasty.  A bonus: pop refills seem to be free!  I think that now that I've settled in the west end, this will now be my go-to for a good fish & chip meal."}
{"text":"Excellent Fish and Chip resto. They have been there decades, they know what they are doing. Fresh Fish, supper batter, fresh fries, and cole slaw made on-site. You will spend a little more than other places, but you will leave satisfied and well-treated. Great place for families and kids. Service has always been friendly and professional.  Take out and eat-in."}
{"text":"i LOVE fish&chips. And this is my fave place. It's been around forever and the decor inside doesn't hide that (either does the sea of white hair). The service is simple and friendly, but miore importantly, the food is delicious! They must change the oil on a regular basis because,  the fish batter is light tasting. I also think they use different oil for both the fish and fries - which I don't think all places do. The prices are reasonable and the tarter sauce is great. I would recommend this restaurant for families!"}
{"text":"Okay. Fish got smaller over years though"}
{"text":"I think this is one of those spots where you pay for where it is located.  On Bloor West it is nestled in the middle of million dollar homes where this fish and chips place clientelle has so much expendable money, they don't mind paying for the convenience of walking from their home to this place.    One small piece of fish, a handfull of chips (child size hand), and that it.  All that for 14.99$.  Sorry, but the atmosphere of the Kingsway isn't worth spending almost 100.00$  for only four pieces of fish for my wife and kids.  It's pretty bad when you spend  that kind of money and have to come home and have a sandwich because it didn't even fill up my seven year old daughter.  Save yourself some money and frustration, find another place for fish and chips."}
{"text":"Nice fresh fish and chips. Service was good too. The only issue was a vinegary smell in the resto."}
{"text":"My favorite in the west end. I usually get Halibut and a few (smaller portion of chips) Always great service and staff whether eat in or take out I've had shrimps and scallops in a combo with halibut Apple crisp dessert is nice Lineups Friday but moves quickly In the east end High Street fave"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips.  They don't have a huge menu, but with how good their Halibut fish and chips are, they don't need anything else.  It seems to be a family run place. Everyone is friendly, the place is clean and the food is prepared quickly.   Even the prices are decent considering how expensive Halibut is these days ($25/lb) you can get a nice slab of fish and big portion of chips for 12$.  They even sell a fish batter which is great for using at home.  I've been here a couple of times now and they make me happy everytime. Edit Remove"}
{"text":"OMG $12 for one piece of fish, $20 for 2  OUCH   I get it, fish is expensive, I also get Toronto is somewhat expensive, but give me a break $20 for 2 pieces of fish and a side, no thank you !  The fish was not the best we've had in Toronto which knows how to do fish-n-chips. I would give it a 6 on the 10 scale.   The place has a great local fish-n-chips feel inside. Service was ok, nothing great. But, you'll go broke eating here more than once a month.  To many other fish options in this area, I'll try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I have been coming this this place for many years with my kids at it still makes one of the best plates of fish & chips in the city. Great service and prices!"}
{"text":"My husband and I happened to be in the neighbourhood running errands and popped in for a quick lunch.   Truthfully, we were both a tad hungover from a 40th birthday bash the night before, so we craved some greasy food and the small lunch sized menus hit the spot. It's a favourite of locals in the Kingsway, you can tell by the clientele...mostly elderly people.  They tried to keep the English theme with teapot decor. Simple and classic.   Get the halibut! The staff are super nice and efficient."}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips. I was here a few years ago and didn't think it was that great but today (and it was super busy with Good Friday crowd) they impressed me. First off there was fast, efficient and friendly service from the start. My dining companion and I both had halibut and chips which is the staple here and one of my all time favourite fish varieties. The batter was thin to medium and super crispy and the chips were a crispy golden brown- both perfected with malt vinegar! For 13.99 at today's prices and $5.50 for an imported beer, I was pleased by the price and quality - great value!"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood spot. Friendly and fun. The fish and chips are a great feed and the pies look great. I had a Cajun grilled halibut that was lightly spiced and perfectly grilled. Good timing on the food and really fantastic service."}
{"text":"When I have to work around this area, I definetly make sure I take time out during my break to grab a taste of fish and chips.  So far this is the only place in the GTA I think, that makes amazing fish and chips. I've been to quite a few and this one definetly stands out. I believe that it is a family owned restaurant that has won so many awards for its fish and chips. When you take a look at the walls in the restaurant all you see are plaques of best fish and chips from 2000 to the present date.   The place is consistently full of customers, majority consisting of families and older people. During lunch time it is very hard to get a seat and on friday's you might as well call ahead to pick up your order unless you have alot of time and patience to wait for a seat and or for take out.    The food is very good. The batter that they use is very well done, not to salty and very light, not like other places where you're eating mostly batter. There are a few choices to choose from you can have fish, either haddock or halibut, shrimp and scallops. The fries here remind me of swiss-chalet fries. They also have onion rings as well which are huge, kind of reminds me of a blooming onion you would get at ribfest. Lastly their bowl of  clam chowder, mmmmm,  now I was never a fan of clam chowder before but after tasting this one, I am officially hooked.  Items to definetly get  - fish and chips (haddock)  - onion rings - clam chowder"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in west side of Toronto! Excellent and fast service. Great location on Bloor in Kingsway. Our kids love this place. We love \"kids eat free Tuesday's\" as a family with three young kids."}
{"text":"Delicious halibut!   Very friendly service!  Downside:  - The fries are soggy and not really crispy at all. - The place has a very odd odour that is quite unpleasant"}
{"text":"Good fish, not so great chips. Plus, the onion rings disappointed me (too much onion, very thin soggy batter, and no crispiness). It tasted like I was eating raw onions which, personally, I can't do.   We visited on a Friday evening around 7:00 PM, and it was reasonably full. We weren't too hungry so we had one order of fish and chips (the halibut) and a side of onion rings. The fish was delicious but nothing out of the ordinary - fried well and very crispy, with a decent amount of fish. It isn't anything I'd come back for immediately, but it was just fine.  The place overall is a bit dated, but is basically the perfectly picture of a traditional, charming diner. Service was friendly. Prices were average. There's street parking available right in front of the restaurant. There are definitely better spots for fish and chips in the west end, but if you're in the area, this isn't the worst spot to find yourself in. Overall, just average.  Our order, with tax and tip, came to just around $20.00."}
{"text":"This place is OK. I think New Toronto Fish and Chips is better because they have larger portions and the halibut is consistently juicy - as well the price is lower at New Toronto. However, I do understand that the rent is probably quite expensive at Kingsway Fish and Chips since it is right beside Royal York subway. The fish and chips is pretty good at Kingsway.   The one thing that really iffed me was that my husband and I are in our 20s, and we were discriminated against by our much older waitress. She was very short with us, and kept saying she couldn't hear us (lack of hearing aid much?), then would go and chat up the older patrons in the restaurant. Not only did this waitress favour older customers, the only time she took out to talk to us when she wanted to shoo us out of the restaurant. Oh well - I think the young owner at the front was great though, she asked us how our experience was and obviously because I am so passive-aggressive we said it was good."}
{"text":"Went here for Good Friday and it was PACKED -- and for good reason!!! Finally fish and chips that aren't greasy or heavy! Delicious good quality halibut in a light, not greasy, breading and good ol French fries. Had the apple pecan tart for dessert too and damn it was yummy. Good service and good food -- will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First try Kingsway Fish and Chips-Friday on Bloor at Royal York - no parking; place was packed. Ordered halibut & chips to go - ok - I've had worse, but I've had better! Pricier than most, and a little bit greasy-both the batter on fish and chips. (Real potato fries)"}
{"text":"Awesome Fish and Chips. One of the best, great for families and always quick and efficient.  We just dropped in with our kids the other night after a busy long day and found things a little greasier than usual.   I also find the washrooms in the basement have always smelled awful. Even my kids hold their noses whenever we go down to use them. It's odd because the restaurant area is always so clean. Even the stainless steel in the kitchen area is super shiny all the time.  Unfortunately I am writing this after an experience which left my husband and I feeling that we won't take our money there for a little while.  We left after an average experience and I discovered that my keys were missing when I got home. I knew they must be on the floor under the table where we were sitting as my coat had fallen under there. Hubby went back to check and they were waving him away as they had closed. Even the server who we had just given a good tip to was not letting him in. He is very recognizable. Finally someone came and he said he thought my keys were there. They claimed they hadn't found them and reluctantly let him go look himself. Surprise, my keys were under the table after all!"}
{"text":"First time here and did pick up for the family. Staff were great with questions. I had the fish and chips. The fish was great but the fries were slightly undercooked but still good. Bonus points for having malt vinegar. Will definitely be back to try again."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is that they are closed on Sundays, and that's the one day I always seem to be craving this place! But really - they are GREAT here!! Fish isn't greasy tasting at all, it is light and crisp and just delightful. The fries are nothing great, but honestly I douse them in malt vinegar and salt the heck out of them and they are just fine. I love the peas and while I haven't tried the other offerings, I suspect that I wouldn't be let down.  I love the decor and coming in here really brings back great memories that I've had in here with my family. I'll just have to force myself to be in the area on days other than Sunday or Monday and I won't be disappointed!  If you are a fish n' chip lover, this place should be on your list of must-trys."}
{"text":"Very delicious fish and chips restaurant with all the traditional favourites. We came in here for lunch and I ordered the lunch haddock with fries and coleslaw which included a drink of choice (I went for the coffee). I also ordered a side of mushy peas. Everything was yummy. The chips were crispy and the tartar sauce was really good. The prices are very affordable, especially their lunch specials. The service is beyond friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be coming back. Such a great lunch experience!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Kingsway Fish and Chips. The halibut and scallops, fish tacos, salad with grilled shrimp and everything down to the coleslaw and chips were delicious. Hot, fresh and tasty!  Great service for our large party as well."}
{"text":"Nice fish and chips. But really... no Greek salad!? They have a mandarin with pecan salad ..but no Greek salad???  Crazy!  Pricey and for the money I really do expect some decent thickness in the fish for what they charge you here. But it appears that coating a piece of fish in the city of Toronto with batter has its challenges.  So far this is the only decent place around."}
{"text":"Having grown up in the east end, I definitely had one of the best options for fish & chips in the city.  Kingsway Fish & Chips is definitely comparable!   The age, decor, and stellar food are all reminiscent of my favourite place in the east.
