{"text":"Absolutely fantastic taste of Asia, westernized just enough to blow my pallet completely out of the water (or the bowl). The prices are great, service friendly, and the owner interactive with the guests. Add in a very uniquely Bowl to Go flavor that I will definitely being coming back for.

I got spaghetti and Italian sausage with a side of spring rolls (weird right?). I expected some poorly assembled excuse at Italian, but instead I found a well crafted Asian dish that took the beat of the Italian and improves upon it.  The spring rolls were good but a little pricey. I also felt that the fountain cups were over priced. Next I'll probably just order like the sign tells me to and get a bowl to go. FANTASTIC."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken and steak teriyaki bowl.  The food came out quickly and was fresh.  A side of teriyaki was provided and I used every drop.  The egg rolls were standard, but hot and crispy.  All in all decent, but next time I would order with vegetables."}
{"text":"Been dying for a good teriyaki and bowl shop to come to Gilbert for years....the time has finally come & this place is fantastic for a steak & rice bowl! (And my 7 year old loves that its a pokemon hot spot, lol)"}
{"text":"A hidden gem.  A new place that is a bit hard to find in the shopping center.  I really liked the chicken PHO.  Great taste and great price.  They also have teriyaki and spaghetti dishes.  Oh, and the spring rolls were really good too.  It is quick service with very friendly staff.

I will surely be back."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The owner is so nice too! I'm surprised this place isn't busy at all times."}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised by how good this was! I had the Chicken Pho and I loved it. The broth was perfect."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time tonight and we will be back! My daughter & I had the Orange Chicken and my mom had the special, which was a Yakisoba Bowl. We felt the pricing was very reasonable for the portion you get! Next time I will be trying the Pho!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy we walked in and the guy rushed to the counter while picking his butt. Also the chicken was very very dry, the sauce is mediocre. Aloha kitchen in Chandler is a million times better."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! You have got to try!!! There cheese sticks (mozeralla) were amazing. Im positive they make them themselves. Soo good!!!!! We got the spagehtii with meat bowl and another italian sauage of course because it was our first time and i was not expecting it to be soo amazing!! Fresh hot fast and delicious!!! I wanna try the teriyaki chicken bowl next. I would give this place a taste. And very nice good workers. Couldnt have asked for better help!!:) we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way here to try it and we got there 30 minutes before they close only to find the doors locked."}
{"text":"I got tofu with veggies and it was really good. Usually not a huge fan of tofu, but this had en excellent texture. The service was great, they were quick and polite without sacrificing the quality. Prices were great too. Definitely didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I'm upset I haven't tried this sooner!!!!!! It's absolutely delicious. Great customer service & amazing food. I tried the teriyaki beef....I'm sure I'm going to try everything else too"}
{"text":"Quick and good. What more could you ask for? I had the beef Pho, my wife had the chicken pho. Both had very flavorful broth and good noodles. My wife mentioned her chicken was a bit dry though."}
{"text":"Really tasty Pho and Yakisoba at really good prices.  Also have good kids meals.  Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Workers were extremely nice! Huge parking lot, amazing crushed ice! I will definitely stop in for another ice cold drink again!"}
{"text":"This place makes the best Teriyaki Chicken Bowls.  The serving size is twice that of other places.  So if you are in the area you must stop in."}
{"text":"Loved this place on my first visit! We ordered the chicken Pho and the spring rolls and they were delicious!  We went back several more times but couldn't get the spring rolls as we were told they were out of them. I thought it was strange the third time especially because it was 4:45 in the afternoon and the place was empty!  I have a feeling the guy behind the counter just didn't want to make them. Take it off the menu if you don't have them or want to make them!  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I have been looking for a quick bowl near by and this place exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"Really great service and food at a very good price!  Our party had the beef pho, meatball spaghettina, and chicken and beef teriyaki, and all was fantastic. Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for YC's, but running errands and pressed for time when we noticed this cool Bowl place...  No one was there when we walked in, so we almost left because it was prime lunch time... and that's never a good sign. However, the guy working there (manager, owner?) was quick to welcome us and explain the menu. We ordered, and soon, there were a bunch of other guests lining up. He brought us our meals and they were so good- I ordered the special of the day, chicken teriyaki bowl, and my daughter got the kids teriyaki bowl- Hot, fresh, fast, and so yummy!  I love the simplicity of the menu... pho (which I will get when it's cooler out), teriyaki, and spaghetti. We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this spot always can grab a quick good bite. Service is always friendly and for a great price. Locally owned and operated by Tom who always greet you with a smile!"}
{"text":"Food so good I love it because their Japanese bowl tasted so delicious and my family liked a lot when last time we were here together for dinner out. We would be back here for more dinner with family again near future! I highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was great!! It is nice to have a Pho place close to work. Employee's were very nice! I will definitely be back I would recommend this placeto anyone."}
{"text":"How did this place get avg 4 stars? I went in at lunch, no one greeted me, and only 1 guy was working. I had to wait FOREVER for my order even though the place was empty. They have a random selection of food, and the menu on the wall didn't match their print out menu. Overall, not worth the $"}
{"text":"I eat at Bowl to Go at least once a month. I always order the teriyaki chicken and veggies and the food has always been fresh and delicious. I like the white meat chicken and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Really good beef and meatball pho! Great flavor and good size portion. A little pricey so find a coupon"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch spot! Very clean, and the food is well prepared. The owner is very nice. Great place!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good all tasted fresh. we were 
First timmers.. enjoyed it! Had the yakisoba soba bowl and teriyaki chicken.  Both were very good!  Did the combo with spring rolls, those were light and delicious. Very clean place! Could probably use a little more signage on the front door. We will be back!! Has seating outside ..."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! I tried ordering delivery and even though they advertise it they said they didn't have it so I ordered from another place. Today I walked to get some food so I ordered spring rolls and the guy said they didn't have any. I said ok how about pork egg rolls and again the answer was we don't have it. At that point I was irritated and walked out. I mean why have things on the menu that you don't carry. At least cross it off with a marker. Horrible experience and I didn't even get to try the food!"}
{"text":"Delightful. My kids are happy, hubby is happy and my tummy is full. It's a win for this family."}
{"text":"Definitely a must for lunch or dinner! Super fresh ingredients, you can tell from how flavorful the Pho was, and I even ordered extra jalapeños and the staff was super cool! They are friendly and seem authentic:)"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time and always have delicious and consistent meals.  Friendly staff and fresh food!  This is my goto place for Pho."}
{"text":"I ordered child-sized chicken teriyaki with brown rice and vegetables.

REALLY POOR QUALITY, DON'T COME HERE.  Even a terrible home-cook could make something better at home.  SLOW SERVICE.

The chicken tasted like it was days old and had no flavor.  I only at a couple pieces because it tasted so old and bland, I was too scared to eat more b/c I don't want food poisoning.  

The brown rice and veggies were also extremely bland.  There was no sauce or seasoning on top, just a small package of low-quality teriyaki sauce on the side.

First of all, it was a major communication breakdown with the guy taking orders and running the cash register.  Had to explain everything several times."}
{"text":"Very friendly owner. Quick, yummy, and very inexpensive. Great location easy to get to and park. It isn't the most authentic Vietnamese but I would still come back again because it was good and convenient."}
{"text":"Best pho ever!!! I go here almost too often...highly recommend. Plus, the owner is very friendly and always working hard!"}
{"text":"Co-worker picked up food from this place for me and it was amazing. Had teriyaki chicken and brown rice bowl. Excellent food"}
{"text":"This was my first time having pho and it was so delicious, I've been plotting my return all week. The same restaurant twice in one week! Unheard of for me, but it was that good. They have a limited menu, but that allows them to do it all really well. Friends had the teriyaki and pork egg rolls and raved as well."}
{"text":"Wow!  The Spaghettini is awesome! Very yummy! The Pho is actually really full of flavor too!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped here with my two kids and had a quick yummy meal. Chicken teriyaki bowls had nice big chunks of chicken and veggies. Orange chicken had great flavor. Will totally come here again"}
{"text":"I gave this place a try today for lunch. I waited almost 30 minutes for my order of Pho Chicken I also noticed a few who ordered after I did get their orders before me. It was my first time visiting this restaurant and it was not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from where I work so I've stopped in a few times on my lunch break. The staff is super friendly and the food is good! I've gotten the pho every time, and enjoyed it each time!"}
{"text":"The owner is great with a great since of humor. The owner said he sales Italian, Vietnamese,. The orange chicken and white rice is really good real white meat chicken. I would recommend  this please to anyone."}
{"text":"Awesome food :) try their pho and pasta and etc! It's a small business go support them!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty cool. They have pho as well as spaghetti and rice bowls. What a variety! I'm picky about my pho and they passed! Delicious flavored broth, noodles cooked just right, nice flavored meat, fresh sprouts, basil, green onions and lime to crisp the dish. Two thumbs up to this new business."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Such a neat concept. Simple menu with pho, spaghetti, rice bowls and a few side/ appetizer items. On this visit my daughter and I ordered the meatballs spaghettina and the mozzarella sticks. The spaghetti sauce is of their own creation, infused with Asian flavors sautéed with pork, onion, and mushrooms..... unique, but delicious. Spaghetti noodles were prepared well with good texture, as were the meatballs. The mozzarella sticks tasted home made with bold flavor, I was very pleased. The owner/ chef was very personable and takes a lot pf pride on his work and business. Bowl To Go gets a big thumbs up and 5 stars from me, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The door was locked at 8:30 with 10 on the door. Chicken came out of plastic and from the microwave for the teriyaki bowl! With sauce dumped on top. The only thing that was cooked was the veggie decor on top!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here every weekend since they opened because that's how much i love it! They cook their food fresh right when you order, they're always friendly and nice, and you can't beat the food! My son and I both love the beef teriyaki rice bowl, and we always look forward to coming here. Seriously love this place!!! We need more restaurants like this in Gilbert."}
{"text":"I've dinned at this establishment twice and each experience had not been anything remarkable. A very average new place which offers a varied  choice of noodle dishes. Me in particularly chose the Pho. Again there was nothing remarkable about it. But, it does offer a safe introduction into noodle dishes and may peak your interest in other noodle cuisines."}
{"text":"Blown away by the reviews of this place to be honest. Some of them seem to be paid for by companies that sell 5 star reviews. You can tell because they are California based.

Anyway we showed up on a Saturday around 2pm and it was empty. Should have been first tip. Egg rolls, spaghetti with sausage and meatballs, beef pho dish and Teriyaki beef. We figured this would be a good representation.  There was 3 of us and we all shared.

The spaghetti was as you would expect at an Asian place but we figured it would have some special twist. Not even close. Horribly sweet. Frozen meatballs etc.

The Pho was tasteless. One of the most bland we have tried in Chandler/Gilbert. 

The Teriyaki beeef was little slivers of overcooked beef. Looking nothing like the menu screen. Very bad.

Had high hopes for it. Nothing worth returning for other than the egg rolls which were delicious hit again little previously frozen type.

Moreno's next door has good Mexican and Jagoya around the corner is the best Chinese buffet in town. Can't say much for this place though. Try at your own peril."}
{"text":"Great PHO for AZ especially! Nice owner.  I always go in late just before they close.  Yet he keeps the door open and gladly makes my food fresh everytime. 
Yep I'm that guy, but never makes me feel unwelcome.  That coupled with great PHO.  
Must check out!"}
{"text":"Just came in for a late lunch with my daughter today & we got the Beef Pho & the teriyaki kids meal. 
AWESOME pho, my only complaint is that I wish it were closer! (We live in San tan valley, no pho nearby)
Great pho & awesome kids meal for the price!!!!
Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Tasty simple basic food. Cheap too! I've gotten chicken and veggies teriyaki bowl twice and was very satisfied both times. Tasty sauce (not super sweet which is good) and fluffy rice.
Their meatball spaghetti was yummy too.
Nice staff, good food, cheap price = will go again :)"}
{"text":"My daughter had the orange chicken and loved it. I had the chicken pho. We shared the potstickers. Everything was very good. Friendly, fast service. Lots of parking in the plaza."}
{"text":"We saw this place on our way home and stopped in. So good!! I think we tried about everything! Super friendly and fast. Can't wait to go back."}
