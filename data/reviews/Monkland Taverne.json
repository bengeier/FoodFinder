{"text":"So noisy we could not have a conversation.   Asked to be moved.   There was a table available but not for us.   No accommodation made.  We left.  Won't return."}
{"text":"Excellente bouffe et bonne sélection de vins. Très bon service également. Le gros point négatif est le bruit. Sincèrement avec la musique et le son qui rebondit...notre dîner en tête-à-tête a tourné plutôt à: on sort au plus vite après le repas principal!"}
{"text":"An institution on Monkland Ave. Get there early on weekends because it's always full and they don't take reservations. The food is always excellent, and after countless visits I have yet to be disappointed. The only downside is they tend to overprice their wine.    The crowd is mixed in age but mostly anglophone"}
{"text":"We went for a dinner group of 4. The place is nice. The food was not too bad but quite small dishes. Overall not a very good value for the money in my opinion."}
{"text":"Le Mac n Cheese est succulent!!!! Je ne peux y aller sans en commander! Leurs choix sur l'ardoise au mur sont inspirants et nous n'avons pas encore été déçus."}
{"text":"I was very excited to go to this restaurant after hearing about it being a staple in Monkland village.   The staff are very nice and the service was great. overall ambiance in the place is awesome.  The only problem... Very over priced for the menu items that are offered...  $$ wouldn't be accurate."}
{"text":"Nice quality and ambiance  not always a flavour explosion but solid good decent food!  also the nicest place on monkland for nice dinner out"}
{"text":"Tavern is one of my mom's regular neighborhood  spots and I have to agree that it is always consistent in terms of food and service.  There is often a wait and it gets very loud but we arrived around 6:15 on a rainy, Saturday night so there were only a few people seated when we arrived.  They have a seasonal daily menu along with their regular menu, so there are plenty of options and something is sure to tempt your palate.   We started off with the crunchy, coconut shrimp. They are a nice size, plump and juicy with a sweet honey sauce. Their salmon tartare and calamari are also  solid choice as starters.  The Mac and cheese is usually my go to dish when eating here because it is truly one of the best macaroni and cheese's I have ever tasted. A mix of cheese, garlic , a little tomato and truffle oil perfectly merge together for a melt in your mouth, decadent experience. It is a hearty portion that is great for sharing but it is definitely worth indulging in if you love macaroni and cheese.  But on this visit, I wasn't starving nor did I want to leave feeling stuffed so I chose the hanger steak which came with a fennel salad.  The steak was beyond tender, deliciously flavored and perfectly cooked to medium as I had requested. It was served with a red wine sauce and I enjoyed every mouthful.  The salad was on the salty side and did nothing for me but I didn't order this for salad, so no biggie.   My mom had the pork chop, a huge monster sized portion served with bocconcini salad. I'm not a fan of pork chops but it's aroma appealed to my senses and I had a bite, which I enjoyed thoroughly.  It was lightly breaded and nicely spiced and I definitely recommend it.  We were both in the mood for something sweet and chose the bread pudding with caramel sauce. It was moist and custardy with chocolate chips nestled in between a caramel sauce. Overall it was good but the caramel was sparse in quantity and could have been thicker.   All and all a top food choice in NDG."}
{"text":"My mother and i love this place. Its even better in the summer to sit outside enjoy a nice drink along with their excellent food. Its not a cheap place but not overly priced very reasonable for the type of place that it is."}
{"text":"I don't know what is happening lately with this place but the service is slow and the waiters are not nice; the food is mediocre. It's too bad because it used to be my favorite neighbourhood place."}
{"text":"On a cold winter's night you can find me nestled against a wall where an antique-ish radiator belts out warm air. If you look closely you'll see that I'm a woman of a certain age on a date. The candle light softens and smooths the face and creates a natural intimacy. The wine (expertly recommended by the charming staff) flows freely and as the night progresses you'll hear our laughter joining the growing din as the restaurant fills with locals (get there early if you can). The food is dependably good - I usually go for salmon or pasta and they've never done me wrong. As our date comes to a close, our waiter has the good sense not to assume the man is paying the bill and I tip him a little extra for the courtesy.   I've also chosen Tavern to break up with a sociopath executive who begged me to hand over my phone so that he could delete the evidence of our affair. I still enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and enjoyed my meal before but this time I was slightly disappointed. It is a little bit overpriced for what you're getting.  The salmon tartare entree was delicious and fresh. Oysters are typically fresh here. Priced decently if you go during their happy hour (5 to 7pm). German mashed potatoes were good. The fries however, while inexpensive, were greasy, short, and lacking flavour. The worst part was definitely the cheese platter. Overpriced for some small slices of mediocre cheese. The bread it's served with was also unpleasantly cold (not room temperature, not somewhat warm,  but cold). According to the waitress this is how things are done there and the bread can be cold if you're not getting a fresh batch right out of the oven.   It seems unclear whether this restaurant is trying to cater to finer tastes or to the masses. The prices are high and the menu specials are usually good, but the portions are very small and the main menu seems to be hit or miss."}
{"text":"We arrived around 6:30 on a Sat night and there were only 2 tables available. It quickly became so crowded people were waiting for an hour or so. They do not take reservations. There was lots of energy and it is LOUD. But the service was impeccable. Great consults and recommendations on drinks. And the food was spectacular. In spite of the crowds waiting we never felt hurried and were welcomed and pampered. It was not inexpensive but well worth a special, fun night out."}
{"text":"3/15/15- Recommended by a local Montreal chef. Best food during this trip hands down. We had the chef of Taverne pick a few items for us. AMAZING! Korean Beef Tartar, Pok Pok Crispy Shrimp, Albacore Tuna on Tostada, Mac n' Cheese, Butcher's Choice Steak, is some of the dishes I remember. After the meal, we ordered shots and had them with the Chef. An evening to remember."}
{"text":"It gets very loud and crowded but it's popular in the Monkland Village. The food is pretty good but expensive.   The staff is busy so don't expect much other than basic order taking and food delivery. Nice bar but that also gets very busy."}
{"text":"Went there recently for dinner amongst friends and thoroughly enjoyed the vibe, menu and service. We were able to carry out conversation even though the room was full. Definitely looking to going back."}
{"text":"I have been several times to Monkland tavern there is always good comfort food and quick service. If you a good tartare, a burger or beef bavette you can't go wrong. The only draw back is it can be loud and crowded."}
{"text":"I was tramping around Montreal by foot when a big snow storm hit.  My husband and I kept looking for an open restaurant or pub so we could get out of the weather.  Because of the holidays, not much was open (or friendly, oddly enough) and our faces were frozen.  Without nearby options, I said, let's get on the metro and go to the Tavern.  I was not disappointed with our choice.  The staff was friendly and welcoming as usual.  As we sat at the bar, we watched the restaurant quickly fill up with neighborhood locals.  We started with the ginger shrimp.  My husband was amazed to see me devour the shrimp as I don't particularly like seafood.  I said, I don't like shrimp, but I eat them here.  They're that good.  For mains, we split the salmon tartare.  The crostini was perfectly toasted and the salmon was married perfectly with its bed of cool, creamy avocado.  We also split the mac and cheese and the meatball sliders.  The sliders were perfect.  Just the right amount of spice and sauce over juicy meatballs.  I have never ordered the mac and cheese here because I always refused to spend over twenty dollars on something that I can make well at home.  Big mistake.  This is not your grandmother's mac and cheese.  It is worth every penny and I would be tempted to move to Montreal in order to eat this on a regular basis.  Bite the bullet and find out what you're missing.  I can't wait to come back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"For a leisurely casual business lunch (read, somewhat slow service), this Taverne fits the bill eloquently. Surrounded by lots of business people both inside, dressed in suits, and outside on the terrace enjoying vino at lunch, I could have spend hours here.   Who knew that warm goat cheese with roasted tomatoes and spinach salad could be so beautifully perched as a terrine next to a bed of dressed greens and taste so divine. It's the most delicate and tasty salad. And perfect if your lunch includes lots of chatting, as mine tend to.  I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, water refilled often, good wine  list, limited beers. Specialscare definitely worth listening to and ordering. Had a wonderful pasta as well as the salmon tartare to start. Good cafe latte to finish. Great people watching as well. Cozy upscale casual place."}
{"text":"Very good food, very good service. A little bit pricey but worth going. Definitely recommend this place for a guaranteed good moment."}
{"text":"Or La Taverne Monkland.  Very good food, fantastic atmosphere.  A tad pricey compared to a nice downtown restaurant but Monkland village is becoming more and more a trendy destination to eat.  You can park on a side street to save from meter parking and buy a cappuccino after dinner instead!  Only negative is that they don't take reservations so you may have to line up...bit of a bummer."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced! I could probably stop my review right here.   The place is very nice, the location is great, the service was very pleasant as well! But everything we ordered was quite boring. We ordered one entrée, a $32 bottle of wine, a pasta dish, and a hanger steak. This came to $130 with tip. You can do waaaaaay better for $130 than what I got the other night in at least 50 other montreal restaurants.   Bottom line... The food was okay, but it was overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this restaurant - I've been a few times and was always impressed with the quality of the food , fresh ingredients , tasty food and nice relaxing decor. Very good mac and cheese and also had a great oso bucco - th"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place!  We went out here for dinner on Saturday, small cozy atmosphere, very good service, nice layout. the food is awesome, we got to try out a few of the entrees, honey ginger shrimp was good, salmon tartar was really good, I loved the buffalo mozzarella, but the mac n cheese was awesome. after all that I had the duck confit, very good as well, washed down with a nice bottle of wine. cant go wrong, and the cookie dessert is really worth saving or making some room for."}
{"text":"Qualité de saveurs !! de portions et de presentation ; petites assiettes gourmets pour accompagner la boisson mmmm prix consequant à la qualité , jolie ambiance , lumieres tamisées , tres bon service et belle terrasse !"}
