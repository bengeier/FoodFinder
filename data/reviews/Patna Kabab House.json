{"text":"Five stars for the taste of the food. Friends from work who live in brampton told me about this spot! The beat nihari ever...wow...all the food is soooo tasty. Youl want to sit there n eat all day. Decor is not the best but youl forget about it once u taste the food. Service is great. Very nice people. This is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Food is good but they need to restore the dining area and clean the washroom of the urine smell. Chicken biryani and whole tandoori chicken flavours are great."}
{"text":"Great Nehari!!! Very good Gola kababs, Seekh kababs are good too, very fresh naans, the place is not very nice to sit and eat, but the food makes up for that. Whenever you're there make sure to have their nehari, havent had better nehari, been to chicago, had nehari at Sabri, but still think their nehari is  better than theirs."}
{"text":"The most amazing Bihari kabab rolls ever. The Nihari also pretty good although not as good as iqbal kabab and sweets . I usually order takeout in advance."}
{"text":"Visited today.  Ordered: Chicken karahi - did not look like classic chicken karahi as this karahi had gravy in it. Real karahi does not have gravy.  Nihari - the beef piece was a little rough but so tasty.   Naan -  very good  Tikka -  it was just ok  Whole chicken -  it was good    The place is good but is definitely not organized.   I not sure if i will return but the place is overrated for sure."}
{"text":"This place does not even deserve the one star given, but i had no other option in order to allow me to express how i feel right now. This is my first time on yelp, writing a review and i'm so disgusting as i write this, when you see the pictures below you will understand what i mean. i drove from far to this place based on others reviews. i spent over $30.00 and came home to open food that was totally raw. the shiekh kabobs were all so salty to start of with and when i took a bite, i realized it was all pink from inside. i starting breaking all of them open and it just kept getting worse. the chicken in the briyani was so nasty and the rice was so slimy and flavorless, to top that off the lamb curry i got was also not cook and it was covered in so much oil and tomato sauce. i can not believe that food like this is served, if i was close by i would have personally drove back to this unclean place to show them what they are giving customers who order take out.  First and Last time here, never ever going back."}
{"text":"Who makes the best Nihari, Biryani and Bihari Kebobs in Toronto? It's Patna Kabob House."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but the customer service is horrible. There staff have absolutely no respect for customers."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to taste Pakistani food. All their dishes are delicious and tasty. Our favorite is Bihari Kabob, brain masala (rare to get in T.O.) and Nihari.   We happen to go to this place often and they have always exceeded our expectations. Its a little run down place but the food makes up for everything.  Overall, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I hear they've done a reno here and its a good place to sit at now. Its not fancy by any means but its large and clean.   The food is great! we had bihari kebabs - some of the best in the city and the naans were oh so freshy - so fantastic! We had the milky seekh kebabs as well which were really great!  The chicken biryani and haleem were not that great. I plan on trying the nihari next - heard its pretty great too!  ps: its HALAL"}
{"text":"I have been here once and it was ok. I don't think I would go back again. I prefer Lahori Tika house in little india.  We ordered naan, butter chicken, and nihari. The food was pretty  good but the atmospher was very off setting. it was very cold inside, the tables were not so clean, and the bathrooms were in the weirdest place. You had to go all the way into the basement through all these hallways and finally get to the bathroom. I felt kind of dirty eating there. They put the naan in a bread basket that wasnt even lined with parchment paper or anything. this place is just a bit too grungy for me and the food is good, but not good enough to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant countless times, but my most recent visit makes me not want to go back. There were ants, yes ants, in the serving dish in which we were given naan. Disgusted, I told the people behind the counter and they didn't really care. They did offered an apology and comped our 3 cans of coke but they didn't take this seriously. I'm never going back there, ever again!"}
{"text":"This place really surprised me.  I wasn't expecting much, because as others have mentioned, its not the best decor and ambience, but who cares.  You come here for kebabs and the food is amazing.  We ordered a bunch of different kebabs and each was good, the behari was amazing.  We also had some vegetarians with us and ordered some daal.  Everyone enjoyed the food.  I didn't find the food too spicy as others have said, it was just right.  I would recommend the owners take a bit of time to ensure the tables are cleaned more promptly.  This might limit the criticism of this place, which is otherwise a bit of a hidden gem on the east side of town.  I would come here again and recommend it.  If you don't like the ambiance, just take the food to go."}
{"text":"Best Nihari in GTA. Other item to consider are Behari kabab and roasted whole chicken."}
{"text":"Nice place every food I like here but I don't like there seating arrangement they must have to upgrade the restaurant but still worth to eat from there."}
{"text":"Best Nihari you have to try to believe. Their Reshmi Kanab are really good too and the naan too"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner with family. The place isn't a formal dine in place but the NIhari is amazing! I had the butter chicken and the kabobs, which were also good. This place is known for there amazing NIhari but the butter chicken is amazing too. They don't serve you, you have to line up to order and then they call Out your name once it's ready, but it's all worth it !"}
{"text":"Owner is a great guy. The food is amazing. Typical Karachi food. Great flavours. Keep it up."}
{"text":"'Nihari' (pronounced 'Nee-haari' or Nay-haari') is a Spicy Pakistani Beef stew. It is cooked for hours to get the beef flaky tender. It has lots of pungent tasting gravy (thickened with flour) lots of lil on top, but no other complicated items. At the table, It is garnished / topped with julienned ginger, cilantro, and a squeeze of lemon/lime. Then consumed hot in a bowl (traditionally metal) with fresh baked leavened flat bread.    When a friend mentioned that these guys have the Best 'Nihari' in town,  I was on-board.   Four of us guys drove from Downtown to this place. When you get here, it is sorta disappointing to see the restaurant (outside and inside) it is dark, dingy and smells of Nihari as soon as you walk in. bordering between clean and dirty. but when you think about it, its a low end casual joint, focussed on serving great tasting inexpensive food. And great food is what you get.   Make no mistake about it, it is a basic restaurant with no bells and whistles. You enter, order from the 10 or so items on the menu, order your bread. Then grab a table. You pick up your food, when your order is ready. You grab your cans of pop from the fridge in the dining room and go at the food. Pay after the end of the meal.  The Nihari was all that i expected and more. The Bread was fresh baked, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. (a bit thick for my taste but i know that a lot of people like it this way) Exceeded my expectations.  The Chicken karachi we had was so so. but the Bihari Kebabs were pretty good.   People, Listen up!  You gotta try this Nihari. One of the best Nihari I have ever had (even in Pakistan)   p.s. its Halal / Zabihah"}
{"text":"One of the best nihari in toronto. Bahari kebab is also very good, as well as the naan. I've had a few of their other kebabs which are really good, and the butter chicken is fine. The standout is the nihari though.   You have to get your own utensils and plates at this place and it's a little run down, but that didn't bother me."}
{"text":"Pros: Good Nihari and kababs Cons: Unclean restaurant/washrooms and have to buy water"}
{"text":"Amazibg food. i live for their Lahori Chana. My best friend is Pakistani and he says the Nihari is the best he has ever had in Toronto.  great vegetarian options, and such amazing prices. You get enough for two meals!  oh and the fresh bread, wow!"}
{"text":"Just giving them 3/5. They can make an effort to keep the place nice and clean. The place is kind of dirty and dingy.   Apart from this, food itself is amazing and pretty affordable.  Their chicken seekh kabab, chicken biryani, Nihari, and naans are outstanding. Very nice environment for families; free of dirty and nude bollywood song videos and award shows."}
{"text":"AWFUL customer service. Simply AWFUL!  My boyfriend and I visited Patna this Saturday for lunch. We arrived shortly before it opened and were among the first ones in and to place our orders. After waiting 30 minutes for the food we approached the counter to find out how much longer the wait would be only to find out that they had accidentally packed the food even though we clearly specified that would be dining in when we ordered and were sitting bang opposite the order counter waiting for our food the entire time.  We asked them to please heat the food and plate it so that we could eat. This took another 15 minutes and when we finally got the food it was completely cold. We then requested them to heat it up, which once they did, they just left on the order counter to get cold again. Not once were we told it had been heated, it was just our sheer good luck that we noticed it shortly after it had been heated.  Not once did we recieve an apology for their pathetic customer service, even though we called them then out on this when paying the bill.  We will most certainly not be returning!"}
{"text":"Their nihari is really really good, the bihari kabob - not so much. Food was served fresh and the ambience was a typical hole in the wall restaurant. The service is fine and if you are looking for something fancy - I would go elsewhere. If you are however, looking for great nihari served with fresh hot naan - you have found the right place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"i am giving 5 stars for the food like nihari and bihari kabab. i have been coming to this place from the US every 2 months for the last 7 years. food is good. in recent years they have renovated the front only but i have to admit other than the food everything at this restaurant is nasty filthy dirty and old. do not even think about going to the washroom or the prayer room in the basement. you will regret. they do not clean the tables properly in the restaurant and floors are slippery with grease.  0 stars for the restaurant and management - 5 stars for nihari and bihari kabab"}
{"text":"Seven yellow cards since 2012 has this place rated one of the most unsafe dining places.  read below: http://www.blogto.com/eat_drink/2015/08/the_15_worst_restaurant_offenders_according_to_dinesafe/"}
{"text":"No frill attached-basic non fancy joint!Located in quite a run down plaza but the food ROCKS!!Quick service and outstanding nihari and brain masala with piping hot naan!!Its def a hole in the wall!All nihari lovers this is the place to eat!!I will be visiting here more often to enjoy the warm food in winters!The spice level is not too bad since I myself eat mild Pakistani/Indian food and I did ok here!!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, nothing amazing.We ordered beef kebabs, chicken biryani, nans. It's a bit pricey  for what you order. I found the cashier was abrupt and not polite."}
{"text":"This place is very unclean. Tables and chairs are filthy. Bathrooms are dirty filthy and without hot water in the middle of winter.  Place is full of crying babies, most likely crying after eating the food.  Food itself is mediocre, food is laden with spices, overall not a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Among the best Pakistani food in town!! Their Barbeque and Curries both are delicious and especially they are famous for their Milky Nans.  We went as a group of 12 and ordered Chicken Karahi, Nihari, Beef Seekh Kababs, Reshmi (Chicken) Kababs, Gola Kababs, Biryani and Naans. We wanted the Chapli Kababs but there weren't any available.   It's self serve and they give you papers with the limited menu printed on it, there aren't much varieties but that kinda limits you the best.   The food was delicious and does have the Authentic Pakistani Taste especially the Karahi and Nihari. The Biryani was good but not great! As for the Barbeque, that was great as well. The Naans were the best, one could have them just by themselves! (However if you do take out, the Naans won't be the same, that freshness will be lost)  One drawback is the quantity, it is less and hence you end up ordering more which then adds to the cost. For a group of 12+ children, the amount was pretty high.  Also that the seating is limited and the area is small !  All in All Great Food and Experience !  Food - 4/5 Price - 3/5 Quantity - 3/5 Ambience - 3/5"}
{"text":"Their nehari is best.. not as good as sabri nihari in Chicago usa but close... one  time they missed the lemon ginger etc on side.. but out of 100 time i got nihari they missed it once.. so no worries! Bihari kabab is also good... ordered biryani as catering and it was good!! No complains!! Hidden gem for nihari!!"}
{"text":"The most amazing naan, butter chicken, and tandoori chicken there.  Their nihari is also delicious!  When you walk into this place, you will notice that it's a dingiest, sketchiest looking place ever.  I parked into the parking lot on one occasion and caught someone breaking a lock open in this other place next door...(I pretended I couldn't see anything...).  The restaurant itself is definitely almost mediocre dirty but there were lots of people...so I figured, hey, if nobody has died here yet, it's probably the real deal, genuine stuff.    And boy, I'm really glad my friend convinced me to stay.  They've mastered their spices to perfection (maybe they toned it down when they saw two Asian girls walk in) but nevertheless, SUPER delicious.  Their naan, I've not been able to find anywhere else just as good.  It's super fluffy and just pure goodness.    I've come back here on multiple occasions now.  Don't let its outward appearance fool you.  It's definitely a little daunting when you go in.  Oh...I did also go down to their washroom once and that was a bit of a horrendous experience.  Don't pee unless you absolutely need to there.    The fact that I'm giving it 4 stars means that the food has over-ridden all that sketchiness of the washrooms and the ambiance...meaning that it's REALLY good food.  Y'all need to go try it :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst service. You dont have to wait for a table, you just walk in and sit anywhere you like. People fight with each other to get a table. The guy who stands by the counter to take your order is the rudest human I have ever come across, doesn,t smile or care about the customers. I ordered a karahi chicken and ended up getting a nihari, when i complained about it the guy at the counter just shrugged his shoulders and said too bad. The nihari was disgusting by the way. The only okay item was the bihari kebab. They don,t even know how to make proper nans. By the way when i left the restaurant I also noticed a temporary pass on their window from the health department. I dont understand how places like this survive."}
{"text":"i went here last nice for a friend's birthday. There isn't a ton of menu items. I was hoping they would offer some appetizers on there menus such as pakoras or samosas. The place was empty and services was okay. i did have to ring the bell to get a person to come out from the back. The seek kabob was just okay i found it a bit dry. The naan was fresh and hot and huge. The Nihari beef was soft and the soup the nihari was in was flavourful. The Nihari kabob with fried onion was great and we should have over a couple of more of those. The price for the food wasn't crazy 33 for 2 people with tax and tip."}
{"text":"Okay, so really you can describe this place as more of a \"dhaba\" than a restaurant, and yeah, the customer service isn't great - they don't speak amazing English, they are kind of abrupt - and sure, you have to place your order at the counter (and go up to get your food, and go up to get your own cutlery, and clear your own table) but good food covers a loooot of sins in my books, and boy, does this place have good food! I will go back again and again just for the chicken karahi and the nihari. Absolutely delicious. Lahore Tikka Who?!"}
{"text":"Not very fancy in appearance. Its actually kinda ghetto looking in a ghetto small run down plaza.   However, the chicken biryani was great. Under $7.00, and it was a HUUUUGE portion with lots of chicken in it, which is more than you can say for most Indo-Pak restaurants.   We asked for more raita and they gave it for free (unlike Pak Centre) even though it was small and a lil runny to begin with.  The menu is quite limited also.  But what I can say was the chicken biryani was very tasty and I would return!!!  My friend is Pak and she said her fam always caters from there."}
{"text":"We picked up some Nihari and naan to go.  It was good, but did not include any lemons, cilantro, ginger, etc.    would try again !"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to make the journey here on a Saturday evening. I say journey because this place was located out in Scarborough, and we were going from downtown, so overall it took about 40-50 minutes to get there - but it wasn't the worst. The bus from Victoria Park Station (67A), pretty much drops you about a 2 minute walk from the place, which is great.  We walk in and immediately we get a feel of Pakistan. The place was pretty packed, loud conversations, traditional clothes, and a fairly family affair. I assume part of the reason for the rush was that it was a weekend, so it was understandable. We were just 2 people, so luckily it wasn't too long of a wait - about 15 to 20 minutes.   Their ordering system was unlike other Pakistani restaurants I've been to and more fast-food/self-serve style. You order at the cashier, pay for the food, then pick it up from the counter when they call out your name. It's a nice system though - it means fewer waiters hustling around the restaurant, and you don't have to wait to pay when you're done.   Now to the food; we ordered: seekh kebab, silky (chicken) kebab, chicken biryani, chicken karhai and one naan. The total came out to around $24 for all the food, which is actually half-decent. Our order was ready in about ten minutes, which is great. In terms of taste, I would probably rank the food as: (1) karhai (2) seekh kebab (3) biryani (4) silky kebab. Don't get me wrong though, that doesn't mean any dish was bad, that's just a personal preference thing. Everything was really pretty tasty. One naan seemed to be sufficient for the two of us, and it was a milky naan so it was soft to break and eat.   Because of Patna's distance from us, it probably means coming here is a 3-hour affair, with travel and eating time, so I'm not sure how often we'll come but it's definitely something I'd come back to."}
