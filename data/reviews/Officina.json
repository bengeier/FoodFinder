{"text":"Nice place, good service and woow food, one of best sandwiches in the area. Costly but worth it. It is almost a weekly visit if not every second day"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this gem by a co worker and it is my new place to eat when I come to Montreal on business. I have had the lox bagel and it generously topped with the right ingredients. Loved it. The sandwiches that are on display look so delicious and freshly made."}
{"text":"I don't know about their lunch sandwiches, although they look delicious. What I do know is that I have been here twice in my past 3 days in Montreal. I had the smoked salmon bagel for breakfast each time. Panini perfection."}
{"text":"The Spot:
If you work anywhere near Victoria Square or just find yourself wandering in the area on a weekday, and you get that undeniable craving for the perfect sandwich, look no further than Officina to fill the void. This minimalist eatery, the best of a handful of gourmet luncheonettes to pop up on Viger between Beaver Hall and St. Alexander in recent years, provides a wide array of freshly made sandwiches that are sure to satisfy and that rarely miss the mark. It's easy to find too; if the black and white Officina sign jutting out over the sidewalk isn't obvious enough, just let your hunger radar guide you to the busiest counter on the street.

What's Really Good:
Four words: Speck, arugula, black truffle. Ok, just three more words: Italian sausage ciabatta.

Actually, while there are some crowd-pleasing staples that never leave the menu, the options at Officina vary daily so there's no guarantee of getting your favourite sandwich every time you go. But that's part of the restaurant's charm; each day the friendly, dedicated staff takes to slicing, chopping, and lovingly combining top quality meats, cheeses, and produce to created limited quantities of their tasty creations. But don't worry if you see your first choice get crossed off the paper menu behind the counter, the glass display case is lined with fresh herbs, a beautifully marbled leg of prosciutto, and mouth-watering sandwiches that seem to shine under the carefully selected recessed lighting, so you'll have no problem finding a second choice (that may likely become your new go-to on your next visit). Other notable sandwiches include a pork loin and caramelized onion baguette, roasted salmon and dill cream cheese ciabatta, and a little Quebec lamb number accompanied by its own jus served hot for dipping.

If you're hungry enough to go all out at lunch, Officina offers several side salads to complement your sandwich for a small surcharge of $2.00. Served in a tiny Chinese food takeout container, these also vary daily but are often well thought out and a refreshing complement to the paninis. In the event that you're feeling real knife and fork food, Officina also prepares all-out meals; the best are the always-available giant homemade meatballs, but a small rotation of better than average home-style proteins rounds out the menu.

And then there's the brownie. While the sandwiches are no-doubt the main attraction here, Officina's rendition is a quiet contender for champion of Montreal brownies. Left in their baking tray between the cash register and espresso machine, you'll be hard-pressed to say no to these tender, gooey, walnut-filled squares of intense chocolaty goodness. But be warned, the brownies are huge and no matter how committed you are to your health you will finish yours on the spot.

You'll Wanna Know:
Officina grills its sandwiches by default when you order, and while it's tempting to always have your sandwich warm don't just let things happen without reflecting on what's between your bread! Certain ingredients, like rare roast beef or smoked salmon, lose the best aspects of their flavour when they're cooked and are much better enjoyed cold.

The place does pack up quickly at lunch time and has limited seating, which works out fine in the summer when you'd rather take your food across the street into Victoria Square anyways (they do take out), but can make things a little claustrophobic otherwise. If you don't mind eating before noon, everything is set up and ready to go by 11:30, at which time you'll get first dibs and a clear view of all the food in the house... and the luxury of time to make a decision.

Sandwiches run between $9 and $15, depending on how fancy you get with ingredients, side salads go for $2, full meals for roughly $15, and pastries for $2-3. Officina also serves Lavazza espresso and stocks a fridge full of cold drinks to wash down your meal with."}
{"text":"Cute little place! My fiancée and I walked in around 1130 AM and they were just making the sandwiches for the lunch rush. We both had our eyes fixed on the fried chicken parm sandwich and absolutely loved them. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had eaten a lot the night before so we wanted to grab a quick bite. I had the chicken parmesan sandwich and it was fantastic. This is a nice place to meet up friends and get some lunch. They also had a café menu, if you want an espresso or a latte. Overall, I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff who explained their wares in English for us! The salmon sandwich and Caprese sandwiches were very tasty  Will be going back to grab sandwiches to go for our next two days of sight seeing"}
{"text":"A perfect spot to stop on my way to work and pick-up a coffee, croissant or one of their grilled sandwiches. I usually get there shortly after 8:00 when the gals are putting together the differs types of sandwiches for the day. I love their tuna fish!!!  Definitely some of the  best croissant and sandwiches downtown. Friendly and fast service in the morning."}
{"text":"Excellent, bright and friendly cafe with awesome, freshly made sandwiches and build-your-own lunch plates. My cafe Americanos in the morning have been strong and mellow, while the lunches (I went back 3 days in a row while in Montreal on business) were all great, including a veggie & goat cheese sandwich, a hot Parmesan chicken breast, green bean and sautéed mushroom plate, and a roast pork, carmelized pineapple and goat cheese panini. Best lunch choice in the area."}
{"text":"Overrated. The side salads are nothing special with a lack of selection. The sandwiches were fine, although a little on the thin side, but the prices are not on the thin side. Overuse of the MICROWAVE! They have 2 blasting non stop. Sorry, you're not getting a strong review from me if that's your go-to piece of equipment."}
{"text":"I don't count anymore how many times I have been there but what I do know is that it is an amazing place for lunch 
They have fresh products and a very nice staff.
You can a nice fish or a sandwich with fresh vegetables or just a healthy smoothie or even taste their soooo tasty brownie 
You can go with closed eyes ;) you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Their sandwhiches are so good. I wish they weren't but they definitely are. It's hard not to go everyday, which i definitely can't afford to because it's 17$ for a sandwich and small side salad. Still their blue cheese kale salad is my go to, almost too rich but still so hard to resist. Every sandwhich I've had is amazing. The Bkt, pulled pork, chicken cesar, steak and blue cheese.. its all delicious!"}
{"text":"Belle petite place pour le lunch dans le Quartier International, avec une sélection de paninis italiens + salades et cafés. Proprios italiens, bon service, belle présentation, wifi gratuit et 2e étage pour manger. 1 panini (trio charcuterie) + salade = 11,89$"}
{"text":"I've had sandwiches here in the past which were pretty good although I was disappointed with their egg and avocado sandwich. The avocado didn't look fresh ( it was brownish) and the sandwich was very bland. For $12, I was expecting something better."}
