{"text":"Hello,

I have been eating sushi for many years and I would have to say that this place is not that great.
We placed an order for delivery and the food came very late. About 1 hour and 20 minutes. When the  food arrived, it was tasteless. They need to step it up."}
{"text":"The mood of the place was good: quiet and has nice decorations. The food was marginal, but my overall experience with this restaurant was awful! The service was lousy: water wasn't toped up and a lot of orders were lost/forgotten. These people are dishonest. Check your bill and make sure they are not charging you a \"fee\" that was not advertised or mentioned whatsoever."}
{"text":"Summary:
Medicore food. Awful service. Dishonest people. Avoid!

Dinner AYCE: $17.99

Review:
We had the $17.99 all you can eat dinner. The food was medicore - there was nothing in particular wrong with it, but it was bland and uninspired. Over the course of two hours we sent three orders to the kitchen. The first order took a very long time to process. After 45 minutes we got our first delivery - 12 measly pieces of sushi, a fraction of what we ordered. A few minutes later a few pieces of tempura came, then a few more pieces of sushi, and after they had our order for an hour we had only received 5 dishes out of the 12 we ordered in our first round. We then submitted the second order. After waiting 30 minutes that food started trickling out. After sitting in the restaurant for 90 minutes we had received less than half of what we ordered. The restaurant only had 3 other tables with customers. 

We then asked about the remaining food and they said there was none - in other words, they had \"lost\" half our orders. When we started writing our third order to get the \"missing\" items the waiter stopped us. He told us that there was a 90 minute limit and that he'd have to charge us. He was unable to provide a sign or menu showing this limit. I called him on it and he grugingly accepted the order. The rest of our food came without incident over the next 10-15 minutes, as the other tables had since left. After I paid the bill but before I was able to leave the restaurant the waiter stopped me and demanded we pay a 15% surcharge for his service. This is on top of the AYCE price, tax and tip. He was unable to provide a sign or menu showing this charge. He said they couldn't be bothered to make new menus or post signs, but that every other customer was happy to pay the charge and we should be too. I know some restaurants charge a 15% gratutity on large parties (usually 8 or more), but they notify customers about this in advance. Here there was no sign or note on the menu - only at the end did they try to take it. We had 3 people, not 8 - and the service was awful. Their unposted service charge and time limit is just plain dishonest."}
{"text":"To be quite frank, I a bit surprised that this little restaurant is not getting more attention - it is unfortunate that my fellow reviewer had such a bad experience. I, on the other hand, have been delighted by the service. 

The hostess took the time to review with us the specificities of the dinner vs lunch menus, and the ordered food came promptly. With this restaurant, it appears that sticking to sushi is the best way to go: the fried noodles we ordered were boiled instead of fried, and immersed in a cheap and overly sweet tomato sauce (not very japanese). The fried chicken was lost within batter and grease. In this regard, I agree with my fellow reviewer: anything that isn't sushi is blend and uninspiring - but I go to sushi shops to enjoy sushi, I don't give much attention to the rest. And in this regard, Gobo Sushi delivers nicely.

The fish was fresh and very tasty. Usually, I always find that one type of fish has been there for too long, but everything from the white tuna sashimi, the salmon rolls, to the shrimp sushi was fresh and delicious Their green tea ice green was one of the tastiest that my mouth ever got to enjoy, and the mango cream was absolutely delightful. The miso soup was smooth, unctuous and very tasty.

The staff was extremely friendly, and even gave us sake to try, on the house :). They made us feel like guests rather than clients. Yes, a few pieces got 'lost'  (just a few) in the process, but to be quite frank, this seems to be a common 'issue' with these all you can eat places for whoever eats a lot - and the sake compensated for it.

Unlike my fellow reviewer, I found the staff to be very honest, as even though miso soups came in 'packages' of three, we asked for 2, and we were charge for two. The price point is reasonable.

The quality of the seafood, the deliciousness of the deserts and the friendliness of the staff are worth 4 stars, although the score is only brought down by the lesser quality of less important items, as well as the 'lost' items.

I recommend this restaurant, and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is great, one of my top three sushi places in the city and top ten restaurants. I'm super picky when it comes to my sushi so that's a huge accomplishment. I've never had an issue with them. If you sign up for Taste Away, you get 25% off coupons emailed to you all the time. I get three meals off $20 dollars. I don't understand the bad reviews but I've only been ordering from them from a couple of months. Bentos are super cheap. Lots of fish in the rolls."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place and I cant understand how it is not always busy!
Everytime I've been there the food has come out really quick - and it tastes AMAZING! I absolutley love the dynamite roll, sushi pizza, fried rice and fried noodles. The service was wonderful...very friendly and welcoming. I highly recomend this place. All you can eat lunch for 13.99 and all you can eat dinner 20.00. Super goooooood!"}
{"text":"Asked for delivery. Pre-paid, waited 2 hours and didn't get the food.
I had to call them and they said the driver was \"lost\", but didn't bother to call me.

Horrible service. I will never order from them... if they manage to stay in business somehow."}
