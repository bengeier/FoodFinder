{"text":"Ok food. Prices are OK. Just an ok place to eat if you feel for steak. The ribs are better at Madison or Baton rouge. Good service."}
{"text":"Okay to eat there. Staff not very attentive. Food is average. Fewer selections of draft beer than most. Can usually handle a group because they are rarely busy. After a visit you'll understand why."}
{"text":"Good spot to go before a movie. Had the chicken Caesar, it was great! Nice touch with the fried onions on it."}
{"text":"The food was tasty but nothing special. A good meal before going out to a movie on a Saturday night. My fiancée ordered tuna sandwich with sweet potatoes fries and I ordered a veggie burger with regular fries. Of course we shared fries to have best of both worlds. Worth the trip and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Was visiting Montreal on business and this place was recommended by the Courtyard Marriott.  Food was good but the customer experience was awful.  It took about 10 minutes for the waitress to greet our table.  When she finally did, we asked her the draft and bottle beer options.  After she gave us the options we apparently to took long to decide (about 5 seconds) and abruptly left and said she would come back.  It took her about 15 minutes to come back to the table.  In the meantime other tables seated after us were given bread and water which we were yet to receive.  When she finally came back her response to the delay in returning to our table was, \"I apologize but it's very busy tonight and in all honestly I know you guys are not from here and know that you'll probably never be back here again so I gave priority to other tables.\"  She had limited interaction with us at that point so it was very obvious that she wasn't interested in serving English speaking Americans.  Not a very tourist friendly restaurant or maybe just isolated to this one employee."}
{"text":"Made reservations for myself and a group of 10 coworkers for noon.
The waiter was good at servicing our table throughout our lunch and that's where my positive comments end.
The french onion soup I ordered was very salty and the vodka 7 i ordered was VERY watered down
The main course was the War Bar which I could only describe as yesterday's filet mignon chopped up, refried, mixed in with some vegetables and rice and covered with a very sugary sauce.
I took five bytes left the plate"}
{"text":"We had a birthday diner for our niece..9 people. Service was cold and not caring. Would not comeback to spend over 300$"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by the front desk of Crown Plaza hotel, it's a great treat after the long drive from Quebec City. I ordered Surf and Turfs.The steak is cooked perfectly, and so does the lobster. Nice ambience and friendly service. It's located in a shopping plaza, lots of parking."}
{"text":"Food was ok but service was disrespectful. Will not return.

Husband wanted to surprise me with bouquet and balloons for anniversary. At the time of making resetvation, he requested resto that if he could bring them flowers could they place these at our table before we were seated. Simple request. They agreed. 1 hour before our reservation he brought bouquet+balloons to the resto and the front desk assured him they'd place them at our table. We arrive for dinner and after a 5min wait (we thought they were setting up our table) we were seated. But there's nothing at our table! Husband had to ask/remind and ONLY then they brought his flowers etc. Totally ruined the surprise!

No one - front desk/server/manager - no one apologized. 

They showed that they didn't care for our patronage and they won't have it. Anyone dining there should be ready for a side of we-don't-give-a-damn with their food.

Giving 1 star as Yelp does not allow zero stars."}
{"text":"This was a tough one to come up with an overall rating but after giving it some careful thought, I decided upon a generous 2 star rating.  The harbinger of my experience was the place was virtually empty on a Sunday night.  A reasonable greeting and I got seated right away but it went downhill from there.  

My waiter took my drink order, promptly returned and took my food order.  However I had to call him back to ask for a side salad as he was gone so quickly.  The salad was bland although the lettuce was nice and crisp.  I didn't feel too bad until I saw the other table get their salads, which were piled high compared to mine; however the real complaint here was that it took me 5 minutes to get someone's attention to see if they had fresh ground black pepper.  Once again my waiter had disappeared quickly when he put down my plate, i.e. didn't even offer.  I think the best way to sum up the service experience for the meal was that I felt bad interrupting my server's evening by ordering a meal as he obviously had other way more important things to do!

He made a brief appearance to pick up my salad plate dropping my fork onto to the table.  Despite the fact there was at least 20 other vacant tables, which all had cutlery he felt obliged to have me use the fork.  If you are going to cheap out and make me use the same fork, at least take 5 seconds and place it on the side plate, not drop it on the table (I wanted to exaggerate and say \"threw it down but I resisted).  Oh, and by the way, my salad was.....  Ooops, gone again not caring how my salad tasted.

The main arrived, the 10oz prime rib.  I had to ask for horseradish because obviously my waiter did not ask if I wanted any.  The meat was actually quite nice.  Good sear, nice and tender, cooked to order.  Finally!  A bit salty but overall I was pleased.  The lukewarm to cool potatoes and veggies however were not great and I couldn't finish them due to the temperature.  I wanted to share this with someone but alas, no one around and by this time I just wanted to bail.

Not once did my server check on me, refill my water glass, ask how anything was.  He was not rude but he was certainly not engaged in providing customer service.  A very disappointing experience to say the least."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to eat here based on some of the reviews. I wanted a good steak. I ordered the \"rib steak\" and thought it was excellent. I am here for awhile on business and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate zero star, not even 1. 
Not talking about food here.  Just salty. That's not a big deal. Service here was hooorrribbblllee!!

 Am from NYC and stopped by Montreal before heading out to quebec city. The restaurant is nearby airport. What can I expect about the food here?

Service here was the trouble itself. 
We,7, ordered bunch of steaks and lobsters.  Food came out pretty late.  That was fine cause we were sorta big group in this neighbor. 

Btw how can we eat lobster without cracker? Kidding me? Waiteress brought the cracker almost when we finished. And ordered the rentil soup. Of course she forgot the soup. My dad got the soup when everyone else almost finished the soup.  How lame. 

Bread.. How come they don't serve free bread with butter before the meal? Isnt it the best part of the dinner? Oh they did.  They served the bread for other table, not for us.  I asked gently why we didnt get the bread.  She(vic?) explained i'm supposed to ask manager to get bread.  Kidding me? I didnt even know they serve the bread before i saw the other table. How the hell i know they serve the bread? Isnt it supposed for them to ask customers whether they want bread or not?? Well, She asked me if i want bread when i'm about to ask the check. I said \"fxx you\" in my mind. 

Ordered kids meal for my nephew and niece.  They were cream pasta and chicken finger.  They were obviously worst kids menu ever.  Pasta tasted like hmmm. Can't even describe it. Chicken finger was very moosh. Btw, Where was the crayon for waiting ?? 

she totally ruined my trip to montreal and would never come back here."}
{"text":"My tab was $40 here.....and I only had a salad and 2 beers.  It was a delicious cobb salad and I really enjoyed the RIckett's Red here in Quebec, but $40?  For a freaking salad?  The gentlemen at the bar next to me ordered a steak and it looked just OK, but the look of it did not make me jealous at all.  He also asked to take pictures with the bartender, I was also not jealous of that.  

If you are staying in the nearby Courtyard, this may be the best place within walking distance to eat.....just be ready to pay for it."}
{"text":"MEH!
Sat at the bar because I am traveling alone on bidness. 3 people sitting here with 10 empty chairs and I can't get a water refill.
Started with the salmon app, don't bother, I thought it would be chunks of salmon but it was like a chicken salad all mushed together with no flavor. Caesar salad was soggy with no flavor. Needed something healthy like seafood so I ordered the sea bass. Has the cook ever heard of seasoning? It had ZERO flavor on a bed of rice & steamed veggies. I doubt I will come back here. Off to Tim Hortons for anything better."}
{"text":"The foods are good but the services are extremely slow, water never gets refill. We waited 10mins to get served, then the foods comes very slow too. If you rush to a movie, don't pick this one althought it is beside guzzo. So so!"}
{"text":"On a recent business trip to Montreal, we had business meetings in St. Laurent, and a colleague recommended this place for lunch.

Located inside a strip mall across the way from Cote Vertu (a shopping mall), my initial reaction was...another commercialized bar and grill in suburbia land.

Although my initial perception was somewhat correct, I must say that this restaurant did not fail to serve good food.

First off, the service was extremely friendly.  The waitress was very attentive and kept our beverages flowing at all times.

Then, there's the food.  I ordered a filet mignon skewer, served with rice and veggies.  The meat...cooked perfectly.  The rice was also done quite well, along with the veggies (and trust me, I have had my fair share of soggy overcooked vegetables in my lifetime!).

I guess this is a chain (typically a no no in my book, but I may venture back to see how their ribs are, considering they looked amazing in their menu!)."}
{"text":"Food & drinks were not up to the mark.

Ordered Bloody Cesars and they had no trace of Vodka in it. The mushroom pesto was just ok. Chose this restaurant because of proximity but turned out to be a bad choice.

Was impressed with the ambience and outdoor seating. But what's the ambience got to do when the basics are not right!

Will I return? May not!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Large place with plenty of seats.  Large food selection and full bar. A keeper for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch. We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken quickly.

Have to say that the lunchtime specials today was actually very good. I ordered the apple and blueberries salad with chicken (so did my boss) and our client ordered a tilapia dish. The dishes were well presented and the portions were ok. We really enjoyed our meal.

The service, however, was very, very slow. Once we received our dishes, our waitress never came back till it was time to remove the plates. I had to ask another waitress for a water refill. Honestly, for a Monday lunch service the place was really dead (everyone was at DeVino next door sitting outside lol) So not really understanding the lack of attention from our waitress.

So once again food was great, service was not. Maybe we will try the dinner service next time to compare.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had been in Granby, Quebec the previous 4 days (about an hour east of Montreal) for business, and flying out of Montreal at 5am the next morning so I got a room the night before at the Hilton Garden Inn just down the road, and they recommended Fire Grill. Great suggestion! 

(By the way, if in or near Granby, their zoo really has to be the 3rd prettiest zoo in the world and 10th largest as they claim - it is worth the $39.95 Canadian entrance fee and the 1/2 day invested)

GPS didn't tell me Fire Grill was on the back side of a mall, so when it said 'you have arrived' I clearly hadn't - turn right along the side of the mall lol. 

But I found it -very plain looking on the outside though it did have outdoor seating if desired, and I wondered what I'd find inside. Glad I pulled the door open - immediately greeted, warm and rich dark woodwork, quiet, lower lights, booths - everything said 'relax' after a very long day.

As soon as I saw the French onion soup on the menu I knew I had to start with that - perfectly melted and browned cheese, followed by a delicious Caesar Salad topped with small and lightly battered onion rings, nice touch.

I had the Prime Rib and I like it medium well, which is very hard to get a restaurant to do that - whenever I do order Prime Rib medium well it inevitably comes to me medium or medium rare and I suffer through if with friends and not wanting to hold up their meals - but I was alone and unsure what I'd get. 

But it was exactly as ordered - the 10 ounce if memory serves, and I opted for (lightly) garlic mashed potatoes, and grilled veggies. The au jus had some wine in it I think - very delicious and worked perfectly with the meat and potatoes. 

To top it off I had the cherry cheesecake, which was served in a small Mason jar which proved to be the perfect portion size, and the cherries were not the standard syrupy bar cherries, but the real thing with just a bit of their own juice - what a way to top off the meal!

The reason for the 5 stars beside the perfect meal, was the staff - from the manager who stopped by to make sure all was well, to my server who perfectly paced the meal. She was intuitive, attentive, but knew instinctively perhaps I just wanted to sit down, relax, read some news off my phone APP's, and have a quiet meal. It was perfect in every way."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular spots as it's close to work and a favourite 5a7 location.  I think I have to divide this review up in 2 though.. half for the bar and the other half for the restaurant.
Bar:  Service has always been good and drinks great, but the service sometimes starts off a tad slow if your sitting on the balcony.  First off you get asked whether your eating or not because that determines who's going to serve you.  Once they figure out who's taking care of you and the first drink hits the table the service is great.

Dining room
Service has always been great, but I've had a few inconsistencies with the food in the past.  On average the food has been great 90% of the time, and for that 10% where it wasn't the manager didn't charge for the meal.  Good think because I wasn't planning on paying.  I even took advantage of the Astral media certificate sales where you buy a 100.00 gift card for 50.00, this comes in real handy when you hit the bar and the dining room, but keep in mind you need to use up the whole gift card, otherwise the balance is lost.

See ya there."}
{"text":"If you like steaks, don't go there. Chefs don't know how to properly cook a steak. Too expensive, bad service. Really bad experience. A very cheap version of the Keg. Not price wise though. Avoid."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Service was great. Our waitress was very pleasant, efficient and made us feel welcome
- Sweet potato fries are awesome and definitely worth the upgrade
- Food was presented nicely and looked very appetizing
- Very nice ambiance, both inside and outside
- Perfect portions

Cons:
- My burger was a tad dry/overcooked

Comments:
- I'd like to check out the bar area during happy hour. It looked nice."}
