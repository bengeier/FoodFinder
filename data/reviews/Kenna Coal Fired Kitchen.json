{"text":"Great food. Penney pasta with sausage, peppers onions I marinara sauce.  Wife Southern special pizza. Awesome service Jackie. Definitely worth a return for lunch."}
{"text":"We have been a Kenna's fan since they opened. Tonight I changed my tune. After receiving our bill we were told we now only offer one size pizza with no specials which originally drew us to their establishment each week for the past year. There was no warning of this change. As a regular we are disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Good Italian style wings with roasted garlic and onions. Great neighborhood pizza joint that was much needed to keep me from having to drive to Mellow Mushroom.  The beer selection was average with two IPAs and an Angry Orchard Cider--8 selections but the bartender Roy was accommodating with our request to mix a little cider with a lot of Stella. We tried two pizzas-the Napoli which we added green olives to half and the Bbq chicken which needed a little less bacon and a few red onions. Great neighborhood pizzeria with really good prices."}
{"text":"I love this place! Awesome outdoor atmosphere, delicious food. I've had the buffalo chicken pizza and a basil something pizza from here and they were so good! Pepperoni and cheese are just as great. They also have awesome garlic knots.  I've only gotten take out and never eaten inside, but it looks really nice and roomy. Also super nice staff."}
{"text":"Good Pizza, great crust, nice atmosphere, staff was very helpful and considerate.  I had a thin crust BLT pizza that was really flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Super clean and modern feel to the restaurant. I will definitely return Tony Sacco's...happy they are finally in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here since it changed from Tony Sacco's to Kenna's. They still have great pizza, friendly staff, and buy-one-get one on Thursdays!"}
{"text":"Went to try this place today for the first time and it was just horrible!! First we want to order wings for appertizer and the server says \"im sorry we are out of wings\" ok so then my husband wants to order a Blue moon and also they were out of that! So we ordered a margherita pizza and some other items. When we get the \"margherita pizza\" its nothing but sauce and cheese, so we asked the server where was the basil and garlic and she said \"oh we are also out of basil\". She didnt even bother to let us know that before ordering, but still charged us for a margherita when really we had a plain cheese pizza. Not to mention the marinera sauce had no flavor. Why even open if you are out of everything?! Also my husband asked for a glass of water and he never got it he had to ask twice. And she brought me a second drink when we were done eating and boxing everything up! Bad experience we will not go again. By the way we were the only ones dining in."}
{"text":"Usually this place is good. However tonight we are being waited on by the MANAGER no less and service so far is awful. We ask for music to be turned down so we can hear, he walked in back and did NOTHING!. We placed our order that he did NOT listen to and we could barely hear him. We ask for a salad to go, he brought it. We corrected it and he turned and threw a perfectly good salad AWAY instead of just boxing it! Wasteful! His attitude has been disregarding  and cold. He brings a drink to the table and immediately turns and quickly walks away.   In the end DONT come!"}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever had more flavorless pizza.  We had previously eaten pizza from this establishment when it was Tony Saco's, but the reincarnation is not good.  I have had MUCH better frozen pizza from the grocery store than this flavorless concoction.  Never going to order from Kenna's again.  Sad that they are even in business.  YUK!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great specials. They have a small lunch menu that is very economical and very good. Couple of calzones, flatbreads, and salads. Garlic Wings are very good as well."}
{"text":"There is no reason to go here. It is even more mediocre then all the other \"neighborhood\" Italian mediocre restaurants in Charlotte. Caesar salad was an over creamy mess and the pizza was average. We asked for it well done and crispy. It came soft and soggy and we were told that it couldn't go back in the oven because it had already been cut into slices...like it was my fault. No offer to remake it or compensate in any way. Too much garlic in the sauce because people that make bad pizza think that the way to make good pizza is to add lots of garlic in the sauce. Fresh and healthy ingredients don't need garlic. Don't waste your money though I have not found any reasonably priced good italian food anywhere near here. Got to nyc."}
{"text":"Great Pizza!  Very fresh and loads of toppings.  Crust is thin and crispy.  Salads are very large and great to share.  We had a large party and service was good.   We will be going back very soon.  Maybe my new favorite pizza place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"It is a real shame when one employee (the manager) ruins a restaurant. Myself and a group of friends eat at Kenna's twice a month. We have been going on Tuesday's for the last year for their special of half-priced pizzas. Our group varies from seven people, to fifteen. Tonight was seven people. We all ordered our pizza's, as we usually do. Tonight it was six pies. We like to mix and match and then take the leftovers home for lunch the next day. The waiter comes back to say that the manager said there is a limit of five pizza's per table. Really? SInce when? So if a table of fifteen or twenty comes in they can only order five pies? We asked to speak to the manager. The waiter leaves, then returns and says that the manager said he would allow it tonight, but not again. Still asked to speak to the manager. He comes over with an attitude. I begin to explain to him that we have been coming in for a year and never once has there been this pizza limit he is claiming has been in place. I was in mid-sentence as he just walked away. This is a \"manager\"? You walk away as a customer is speaking to you? Very childish and unprofessional. This is the same person who waited on our group about four months ago and was absolutely horrible as a server! The worse service we have ever experienced. I don't know if this guy recently got promoted or what the deal is, but Kenna has made a poor decision putting this guy in charge! I hope he is satisfied, because after a year of being steady customers, we will NOT be back. Way too many awesome restaurants in the Charlotte area to be treated so rudely by a surly \"manager\"."}
{"text":"Good crust. Pepperoni pizza is excellent.  Cesar salad is huge. Great local beers and good promotions on weekdays."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I have never eaten inside the restaurant, but my husband and I have ordered take out twice. We've tried both the Napoli and the pepperoni pizza. We've also tried the hummus appetizer. Everything we've had has been amazing! One thing I like about their pizza is the fact they aren't greasy like a lot of nearby restaurants. I can eat 2 or 3 slices and not have a stomachache afterwards! I highly recommend this pizzeria. Even my in-laws said it was some of the best pizza they have tasted."}
{"text":"Great food I love the bbq chicken pizza and the ceaser salad is amazing. Great staff welcoming and polite. One of the best pizza places in charlotte."}
{"text":"Went out for an impromptu date night after a stressful day from a water-damaged ceiling. Chose Tony's for its Tuesday night deals, large 2 topping pizza for $10 and $2 NC drafts.   Now my girlfriend and I never, ever agree on pizza toppings. I'm a crazy throw everything on it kind of guy, whereas she is happy with just cheese or pepperoni. She went out on a limb and got Italian sausages and red and green peppers, and Tony's nailed it. Big flavorful slices of sausage, not fake nuggets you see normally, the peppers were nice and sweet and with a little roasted flavor. Things really could have gone south with peppers on there, but it was delicious.   All in all, a great place for a quick date or we saw a few families eating inside as well. We chose to have our evening outside on the patio and it was very enjoyable.   Oh, and I was inspired to write this after chowing down on a slice of the half pie we brought home. Who doesn't love cold pizza?!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Great pizza I gave not had pizza this great in a long time !!! It makes you want to say Papa who??? We ordered cheese pizza , buffalo chicken pizza and wings . The lemon pepper wings were a bit to salty for my taste but even with that said they were also the best wings I have had in a long time ."}
{"text":"Lonboy - 9-11-13  I have visited 4 different Tony Saccos restaurants in both Michigan and North Carolina and look forward to seeing this new pizza chain take off so I can visit more locations as I travel around the country.  The pizza is thin crust cooked in coal fired ovens at 1000 degrees (only takes 4-5 minutes).  The restaurants have no freezers or fryers so you get fresh toppings and ingredients that makes for a great pizza experience.  My pizza favorites are the Capo and Napoli, but I really haven't had a bad pizza at any of the restaurants and you can design your own pizza to your specific tastes.  Also, Tony Saccos offers more than just pizza.  At the Ballantyne Commons Parkway store (next to Starbucks for those who know the shopping center) I was pleasantly surprised by an excellent Italian mezza luna sandwich and antipasta salad.  Not only was the quality excellent, but the portions were very large.  Be prepared to take home leftovers for midnight snacks or tomorrow's lunch.  Decor in the restaurant is what I would characterize as casual fine dining and the wait staff was friendly and knowledgable.  I like this concept a lot and look forward to trying out more menu items on future visits."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  The layout is really nice and the table tops are all granite, which makes it look gorgeous. Their menu is filled with a lot of good options!  We started with the antipasto salad, which was perfect!  It had artichoke hearts, pepperoncini, sun dried tomatoes, olives, etc mixed with lettuce and it was light on the dressing which I was happy about.  We split this salad between three of us and it was plenty for a starter.   We ordered the napoli and one other pizza I forget the name of.  They were both delicious.  The Napoli pizza had ricotta cheese, meatballs, basil & the traditional mozz/tomato sauce base.  This was my favorite pizza and I would definitely order this one again next time.  The crust was thin and crispy too!  The other pizza was really good - it had chicken, artichokes, peppers and some other things.  My husband liked this one the best, so we were both happy :)  The service was excellent and the restaurant is very clean.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing! Going back for more. Had the pepperoni and mushroom pizza with Caesar salad, Buffalo wings and the hummus.. Omg delicious.."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time after multiple take out orders.  Pizza I give 5 stars....  Walking at the host stand...zero... We were not greeted...no one bothered to say hello or will be with you in just a moment... ( keep in mind there two young ladies at the stand ) so I give them another Zero....  The par tender older white male was not friendly ..not a good listener and made us feel that he is just not feeling it tonight!! That's another Zero...  The salad was almost $9.00 for half an order... I never knew that there was a lettuce crisis in town ?? And the salad did not impress me anyhow ...I give them two stars..."}
{"text":"Great place!  I enjoy it every time I stop in.  The food and service have always been on par!  Thanks Tony Saccos!"}
{"text":"I rarely venture to south Charlotte, so I was excited to try a place I never heard of before. Stopped by on Saturday evening for a quick dinner and was seated promptly. We decided to start with the half order of the anti-pasta salad. It was a good size for two as a starter. The dressing was great and loaded with meat and cheese pinwheels. We got the 18' (8 slices) pepperoni. Holy pepperoni! This pie was covered! The mozzarella tasted very fresh. I would say, that's one thing that really stood out to me. The pizza just tasted super fresh, just something about it. Yum!  Our waitress was friendly and we enjoyed watching basketball on the Tv's. Good local beer selection too!"}
{"text":"I'm going to wait for our follow up visit to maybe go 5 stars, but this place was a nice find.  If you are a fan of True Pizza in Stonecrest, you'll find this place comparable but without the crowds.  Great service ... they were quickly willing to accommodate our changing one of their standard pizzas to include some extras we wanted.  Even th4e small salad is big enough for 2 to share.  Crust was great.  As I said we will definitely be following up with another visit."}
{"text":"I've been really impressed with the pizza here. Consistently good over multiple visits. My favorite is the 'Capo' with pepperoni, sweet italian sausage, roasted mushrooms & caramelized onions. Mmmmm. The garlic rotolis are also good. It also doesn't hurt that they have a pretty good craft beer selection on draft & bottle. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"We came in for the first time ever, and were blown away by the food. We ordered 12 wings: 6 Buffalo, and Carolina Gold.  We also had the Pepperoni Classic!  Everything was awesome - service, food, even the unsweetened tea - which actually tasted like tea rather than colored water.  Definitely will be back!     UPDATE:  I am beyond broken-hearted to see that this place has been reported \"closed!\"  That explains why my husband pulled into the parking lot last weekend and the place was dark, with chairs still on the tables. I hope this isn't really true - and was maybe an emergency closing or something;  it is (was?) a great pizza place with very good food."}
{"text":"Tony Saccos COAL Oven Pizza is the best pizza I have ever had!  It blows the competition away.  The hummus appetizer is great, and so is the shortcake dessert.  The whole family loved it.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food is really good but the past two visits, I got unlucky with bad service."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good ambiance, full bar and nice family atmosphere. Our local pizza place. Try the margarita pizza!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to grab a pizza. Very casual and family friendly. Staff was friendly and attentive. Pizza was great!  Steaming hot and very tasty. Will come back again and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hopefully you have better luck that me finding this place on your first turn into the Shopping Center....hint hint it's beside the Starbucks. They have to do something about the trees that over up the sign!  Anyway, enough on that let's get to the food:  I shared an order of the rotolis and the Napoli pizza. The rotolis were absolutely delish! They came out hot and fresh with just the right amount of garlic and olive oil. And dipped in that marinara sauce....yummy! They are apparently not on the menu anymore but definitely ask about them because they are worth ordering! The Napoli pizza comes topped with ricotta, meatballs and tomato sauce. I enjoyed it but the crust could have been a bit crisper!  I'm up for giving this place another try....I hear that BBQ Chicken Pizza is worth a second visit!"}
{"text":"Cool ambiance. Love the pizza. Pepperoni classic comes with fresh mozzarella. Great service. Full bar. Bring the family."}
{"text":"Service food and value are top notch. Great specials , everything from half price pizza to wings and pizza specials. Service is always top notch! Pizza is one of the best I have had. Think crust, fresh ingredients and fast. Overall value is excellent !"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza  ! The oven makes the crust bubbly and crispy. Was very happy to find out Tuesday is half price large pizzas.  Service is always good"}
{"text":"Great white pizza....my husband is a white pizza critic and he was impressed. The staff was friendly and they have a nice local craft beer selection. We stopped in for lunch and a 12\" pie was perfect to share. I would definitely go back to try more."}
{"text":"We love this place, had the Italian style wings and white pie with sausage. Just delicious,  our waitress Ashley was very nice and provided prompt service.  Good local craft beer selection."}
{"text":"I'm originally from NJ so prefer NYC-style pizza. Thin crust, big slices, lots of flavorful sauce and no skimpin' on the cheese. I've been to this place twice now and it did not disappoint! I had both a veggie pie and pepperoni, both tasty and well executed. Draught beer selection is waaaay above average, too. Be sure to ask about daily specials - they exist but on both of my visits I had to ask. Free garlic knots if you check in on Yelp & share with your server. Do it - they are Sooooo garlicky and delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The two stars awarded reflects an average score based on our dinner today. This eatery is housed in the \"old\" Tony Sacco's using the same gas/coal fired baking technology. Not much difference between the two establishments.  The space is bright and welcoming, as numerous associates welcomed us to Kenna Coal Fired Kitchen. Our Wednesday visit was greeted with an unexpected promotion offering $10 selected large pizza's. It would appear there are special's available most days and would suggest you check what's on sale each day.  Wait staff is attentive, friendly and helpful explaining a varied menu and the days promotion. We shared a rather generous 1/2 Greek salad consisting of fresh (large pieces) of greens, tomato's, olives and Italian dressing. Feta was served on the side as requested. The half salad is adequate for two.  The pizza was \"unremarkable\" or as my Bride said \"a waste of calories\". The very thin crust pie was painted with tasteless red liquid, fresh mozzarella and plenty of inexpensive pizza meat aka pepperoni. Considering the neighborhoods pizza competition, KCFK has some opportunity for improvement despite the high star totals by my fellow reviewers."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place but overall I was disappointed.  The  sauce had absolutely no flavor and there was too much of it leaving the whole pizza bland. This is my first attempt at coal oven fired pizza. Overall it left an odd petroleum taste on the bottom. Unfortunately I won't be trying it again after this experience."}
{"text":"Get the hummus with pesto.  It is delicious and the pita bread is made out of pizza dough which taste great.  Also, the margarita pizza is really good.  It's like eating a thin crust pizza, so you are full but don't feel like your going to explode.  The Italian sandwich is delicious and the bread is the best part.  creme brulee is also tasty and delicious.  The waitress we had was great and really helpful.  All of her suggestions were spot on."}
{"text":"I work in the promenade so my coworkers and I eat here for lunch atleast twice a week! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The pizza, salads, sandwiches and calzones are amazing!"}
{"text":"Round #2 at Tony Sacco's was pretty consistent with my first visit.  On this go, I had the same server again, who recognized me and chatted briefly about business picking up some.  She was friendly and attentive again, keeping my drink filled.  The food: Rotolis (garlic knots) - Upon ordering this, my waitress let me know that they have a smaller size of 5 knots that isn't listed on the menu.  So I ordered that with a side of the marinara.  Marinara was tasty and served smoking hot.  Rotolis arrived to the table super hot as well.  They were somewhat firm on the outside and soft and hot on the inside.  The service in the wooden bowl was a little odd, and to keep them from soaking up the butter/garlic in the bottom of the bowl, I moved them to my plate (personal preference, not a negative).  Very good! 12\" White pizza - Traditional white pizza with the ricotta dollops on top.  The spots were a little bigger than a quarter and not gloppy, so it was quite good.  Crust was crispy, but not hard, and there were no black spots at all on this pizza.    Once I was done, my leftovers were boxed up and I was on my way.  I had about 2/3 of the pizza left over, along with 3 of the knots (I wish I had asked for some of the marinara to go with it - that was excellent!).  For reheating, I would definitely put these in the oven/toaster oven - microwave reheating makes everything soggy and not as good - but a quick trip in the oven re-heated them perfectly.  I will return to try just a plain cheese pizza - and I will definitely be ordering more of the rotolis."}
{"text":"This is easily my go to pizza joint in south Charlotte. Excellent menu, recently changed when they were able to get out of the Tony Soccos ownership. I've been coming here for years and absolutely love it. Best buffalo wings in Charlotte; maybe even ever. Andrew does a fantastic job with staff and more importantly: beer selection!! Don't pass this place up!!!"}
{"text":"Nice layout, but it doesn't overcome a mediocre pizza.  All the vegetables on the pizza were bland. It  advertises itself as a coal oven pizza, but nothing in the flavor distinguishes from a regular oven pizza. Don't waste your money on the food."}
{"text":"It's really good pizza and wings.  The pizza are stone oven baked and taste delicious.  Half off appetizers on Wednesday and Sunday. This a great place to take the family and eat well.  Service is also really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"We hadn't eaten here since the new ownership and decided to give it a try on half priced pizza  night. The pizza was good and the service very good, but the large garden salad at $8.95 was downright pathetic. It consisted of only Romaine lettuce in large pieces, tasteless tomato slices and red onions. It was indeed large, however, and would have easily feed a family of four. It doesn't help that the far superior Inizios is just across the street.  The dining area was comfortable and roomy and has always been one of my area favorites. The bathrooms were clean and sanitation score high. Hey and you can't go wrong with half priced pizza. Will certainly give it another try but will pass on the salad."}
{"text":"No, stop it.  Making pizza this poor is an absolute shame.  On multiple occasions I've tried the basic margherita pizza and here's my take.  Plain old boring dough.  Learn how to develop flavor through fermentation.  Beautiful ovens so learn how to use them, When you have the tools to create something unique and different do it and do it RIGHT.  Take a trip to New York where some coal ovens turn out amazing pizza and learn some tricks of the trade.  My guess is things got dumbed down so that franchises could follow simple steps.  It's not working, people don't like your food, so stop it."}
{"text":"First time here. We liked the atmosphere, kind of a classier pizza joint. Good music, kept nice and low. Low enough to hear and drown out the loud conversation but quiet enough to have a conversation at the table. Serving staff was nice. We liked the pizza and the garlic knots. It was a nice change of pace from our routine."}
{"text":"Great place for a pizza dinner.  Clean,  and with a good atmosphere. The food and beer selection is good.  I have eaten there, and ordered take out too.  I would recommend dining in and eating your pie right out of the oven. I've found that the thin crust on their pizza will get soggy by the time you get it home."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon to Kenna Coal Fired Kitchen just to give it a shot since it's not far. Both my husband and I were shocked to see the enormous portions of what was quality, very tasty food! The Greek Salad with chicken was YUMMY as was the chicken pesto sandwich and black bean  burger, both on fresh delicious bread/bun! We got three meals (each) out of this order. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I loved this place the first time I went and after a couple visits it changed my mind. The food is a hit or miss. I loved the lemon pepper wings the first time I visited and came back just for those but the next time around they didn't taste the same. The pesto hummus is great but the pita chips can be hard to chew sometimes. Taking a few starts away since the food taste is quality is not consistent!"}
{"text":"The food is good, period.  The service is not so great.  I have been twice now. 1st time the waitress did not write the order down and then served me the wrong thing.  I ordered a sandwich on bread and she served me a pita. I told her and she basically told me I would like the pita more. Not additional offers to correct the situation or make it right? I guess I'm eating a pita then.... Second trip in the hostess was short and rude with a take out order. She told me to go to the bar. The bartender looked annoyed that he had to help me. It was not a welcoming atmosphere.  Again great food but the staff needs to be trained properly"}
{"text":"This place seems to have a personal vendetta against spices. Came here on a Tuesday for lunch. Waitress was friendly and attentive, so let's move on to the food. We started with garlic knots which had great texture but lacked garlic something fierce. The dipping marinara sauce was severely under seasoned as well, needed salt and pepper. We ordered a pesto chicken sandwich and a meatball sandwich. They were both bland and the sides were blah. I've heard the pizza here is great so maybe we ordered the wrong items. I'm not sure if we'll be back to try out the pizza as we're very underwhelmed by the lack of flavors, especially with Inzio now across the street."}
{"text":"Overall average. The pizza is good but just good, their garlic knots are awesome, Italian hoagie was very good, meatball hoagie average a little to much sauce not enough cheese. My son said the buffalo chicken wraps were not good at all. We sat outside and the Server a guy I can't remember his name but he was great."}
{"text":"Okay let me preface this by saying --I am from Chicago ,so to say I am a Pizza Snob is a true statement..but I do give all types and all places a fair shake. I decided to try The New Tony Saccos over at the Promenade. They do not deliver so I knew that I would have to go pick it up. I called and the website does have a download menu but there are no prices on it. I relayed my order which was for two 16 inch pies and one 12 inch pie- and a order of Rotoli's . I asked the girl for the total, she said \"I have no idea - but the bartender will tell you when you pick it up\"??? They told me 20 minutes, I live very close and got there in less than 15. It was very crowded, the bartender was looking for my order which they were just boxing up. He took my credit card and said...62.47!! Holy Mozzerella Batman!  That seemed like a awful lot-but me being a Pizza Snob..thought..its gonna be fantastic! I will pay anything for REALLY GOOD FOOD, so I took my boxes and left.  We opened the first 16 inch it was to be a \"White Pizza (no red sauce) with Bacon and Italian finger peppers. It was White, it had Jalapenos on it and Sausage. BOOOOO then the second 16 inch was a Pepperoni and Sausage, also with Italian finger peppers which were also just Jalapenos -  very few pieces of pepperoni or sausage. The third was a TRADITIONAL 12 inch, just cheese and red sauce. Well--they were all limp, crust was not good, not at all..I am very surprised it is advertised as a wood burning oven - I did not smell it when I came into the restaurant, nor taste it on the Pizza. The White sauce was okay, of course no bacon which is what my guest wanted and very few little piles of sausage - although the sausage was decent,  in a Southern world where most sausage is cut from a hard italian sausage this was loose meat. The two other pizza's were just  meh...nothing..and the Garlic Rotolis were dry and gross..a big hunk of pizza dough  twisted and baked without seasoning and served with a small salad dressing container of garlic oil and vinegar. I will not be returning to Tony's...I should have taken my friends advice and tried the new Pizza Place at Stonecrest called \"TRUE\" --she is from New York and knows good Pizza.. A true waste of $62.47!"}
{"text":"We finally stopped in here after driving by for months saying we should try it. We shared the garlic rolls which were plain tasting bread with tons of butter and garlic on them & a Margherita pizza with chicken. The pizza crust was decent, but the toppings were tasteless. We had to add a ton of salt, pepper and dip in marinara sauce to eat it. The chicken they use is big thinly sliced dense pieces that don't taste good either. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing because everyone else's food looked better, but since the restaurant was half empty on a Saturday night I think they need to work on their recipes. Too bad we won't go back for another try with all the other good pizza options around."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Charlotte.  I wouldn't assume a chain restaurant would be my go to pizza place, but what can I say, their pizza is spot on.    The coal fire gets the crust that perfect thin and slightly crispy.  Toppings are excellent quality.  I love their sausage, mushrooms, chicken, spinach etc.  They frequently have great specials.  Salad: The Tony Insalata Di Casa is terrific and has a great Italian dressing.  Note: a half order can easily be split between 2 people and a whole order is a HUGE salad.   Customer Service is great.  One time, I ordered a pizza and it came out \"a little\" on the well done side, but by no means burnt or anything to complain about.  Without us complaining or mentioning anything, they made us another pizza for free because the first one didn't look good enough.  Thanks for the extra pie Tony.  I continue to go back to this spot."}
{"text":"I've dined at Tony Sacco's many times since they've opened. It gets better every time. My kids love the calzone. My favorite is the meatball pizza with fresh basil. I love the thin crispy crust. Everything is fresh and the service is excellent. Get the caprese salad!"}
{"text":"Not much to look at but the food is amazing. The pizzas have the right amount of char and the garlic \"knots\" are homemade and dripping in minced garlic and butter.  The sandwiches are just right and the best part is that the prices are very reasonable.  They have a small bar and a couple of TVs. There's outdoor seating also.  The staff is friendly and attentive....one of the best pizzerias in the Charlotte are"}
{"text":"Good Pizza!! def give it a try. Flavors are all there very good portions for their subs, they have flat bread subs that are pretty yummi. I didn't give them a 5 star because our Pizza was a bit in the cool side, not sure how that happened their brick oven was right there close to us sitting in the bar, maybe the bar attendant took a bit long to pick it up.  I highly recommend it if you are in the Matthews Area."}
{"text":"Food here is still pretty good! Our issue when we went for dinner was that they were out of 3 different beers!! Every time my husband and his friend kept ordering a beer the waitress would come back and say they were out. I can understand 1 but 3? My husband wasn't that satisfied with the whole experience and was a little disappointed.   The Caesar salad came out fresh. The calzones were all good. And the pizza was good. I don't recommend adding the garlic to it. I've had garlic on pizza before and it always tasted food wether it was roasted or minced. The garlic they had was very strong and squishy. There was more garlic on there than any other toppings we chose.   Hopefully next time we have a better experience."}
{"text":"We really love this place. Great pizza, good sauce and crispy crust. We have always had good service. Wish they would add some pastas to their menu, but that is my only suggestion:)"}
{"text":"Solid pizzas, friendly wait staff, good beer selection and good prices. A couple of large big screens tv."}
{"text":"So I came in here and redeemed a check in offer for a 1/2 order of rotolis. I got to say this is one of the sweetest check in offers around. They are so good!  What I enjoy most about this place is that they offer very good Italian-style pizza in an area filled with New York-style restaurants. There's no huge complaints with the food either. I do feel like they need a few more options, however this probably attributes to their speed as they have above average wait times. High quality and good service, and if you want a change up from all the New York pizza, this is it."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for a while now and we finally did. After eating here I have to say I'm a bit confused by the high reviews. We had the classic pepperoni pizza and wings. The wings are just horrible to the point that we ate a few and just left the rest. They are soggy for lack of a better explanation, they aren't crunchy and have the consistency of wings that are baked instead of deep fried. You can't bake chicken wings, it just doesn't work.   The pizza is just boring and somewhat flavorless. There's nothing that \"pops\" when you take a bite, it's not good and it's not bad, it's just ok, nothing special.   That being said our server was friendly and attentive but still I probably won't be back especially with Inizios just down the street- which is out of this world!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the pizza here. We asked for light cheese and definitely glad to have made that request. The sauce is very tasty and we will certainly return again. The staff was very accommodating to our two year old toddler. The garlic knots were a hit too."}
{"text":"Kenna Coal Fired Kitchen is my go to place for pizza on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Why??? Because you can get a large, 2 topping pizza for $10 bucks! Enough said."}
{"text":"We used a Groupon, which does include alcohol.  My husband liked their sangria. The chicken pesto pizza is really good and the wings are yummy. While wings comes in half sizes, the pizza is only one size.... And it's pretty big... That was my only gripe.   Though the pizza is delicious, for two ppl, it's too much (unless you want to take stuff home.) For 3-4 ppl, it's great. It would be great if they had more than one size of pizza.    Maybe next time, if it's just the two of us... we'll get the calzones."}
{"text":"Had the pepperoni Classico with my husband and son. It has fresh mozzarella, basil, pepperoni, and fresh made sauce. Crust thin, the ray I like it, but enough around the edge to savor.   We also ordered the Garlic Rotoli as an appetizer. These are garlic rolls made of pizza crust and they don't disappoint!  Baked in garlic, olive oil, and Romano cheese they come out hot and ready to eat.   Will return again. This place is a keeper."}
{"text":"I'd say closer to 3 1/2 stars. The food is pretty good but in my opinion much better places in the area. We got the Garlic Knots app which was very lacking. Hawthorne's has a much better version. The Pizza was decent and it may just be the style. I prefer Hawthorne's or Brixx in comparison. Service was nothing special. Kid's menu was typical with no juice or milk option."}
{"text":"Oh wow, a new niche kinda pizza joint that could have delicious pizza that my family would want to eat with regularity, let's GO!!  I like the restaurant's atmosphere.  The guy behind the bar, who I think is the owner, acts with urgency and seems to be pleasant, but not exactly trying to be your friend.  The hostesses are generally nice but not much more than that, but that's fine too...  Wait a second... two topping pizza to-go $27+?  This has to be amazing pizza to be that pricey.... oh wait... it's not.  I mean, it's good... but... $28 or whatever it was?  no freakin way!!  Pretty sure it was $10 for a 6 pack of wings too...  That's basically it.  We found this place to be decent.  But for the price, it completely ruins the value of us eating here.  \"Coal fired\" just isn't worth the extra 15%-20% mark up in price."}
{"text":"Born and Raised in NYC and this is my favorite pizza shop in Charlotte, NC. Closest thing to home (and may be better). Thin crust with fresh local ingredients. Friendly wait staff that personally welcomes me and my family every time."}
{"text":"the best pizza coal fire dont pay attention to kiley or doug with only two stars they don't know what good pizza is"}
{"text":"I liked the pizza VERY much:  fresh ingredients, thinner crust but not too thin, tasty all!!!!   Craft beers on tap:  good selection. Yes! Buffalo chicken salad:  chicken was not rubbery like most places. The small size seemed like it should b a large.  Tasty!  Fresh greens.   Staff:  very friendly!    Bottom line:  YES, I will return!!!  'Go here!!!"}
