{"text":"Cute spot to find some late night shisha. Definitely a younger crowd but they were just chilling so it was quieter. There are tvs and good music so that kept me and my date occupied. When we arrived they sat us in the side room at the small table and we are both quite tall so with some convincing I got them to switch us to a larger table out in the main room. My date wanted to sit in the couches but they said those were reserved for groups, fair enough but it was close to closing time so it wouldn't have killed them to appease us. My date got a vanilla banana milkshake and I got chocolate which were very yummy although I wish they had their liquor licence so I could have a drink while I smoked. I guess that's what makes it a good spot for a younger crowd. I will definitely go back again, it's closer to home than most lounges and it's low key."}

{"text":"If you want a nice and somewhat remote spot to chill and have some great shisha, Habibi is most definitely where you can go! I have been here on multiple occasions. Good staff and food was surprisingly better than expected. They have tv's set up and good music and sometimes a dj set up in the corner of the lounge for the night. On nights where they use the internet for songs they are very open minded with song suggestions to make sure of a happy crowd.  Price; Depending on what shisha you get, if you stick to the regular with no specials added to it, it cost no more than $14. This actually isn't bad at all considering it can last you from about 9pm-2am lol. Also, the staff come by with refills and are generous with them too.  Food; I am a very picky eater so I did not eat anything but the fries from the burger a friend of mine ordered. But, they were quite  good. However, from the reactions I have seen from people who have eaten the food it is pretty good and worth the price (between $10-20)  Negative sides to this spot;The bathrooms are down a steep set of stairs and aren't too pleasant looking... Scary almost. Plus they weren't too clean. The location is pretty much convenient and optimal, for those who do not rely on public transport despite there being a bus stop right outside. Due to late hours of operation, those who must take a bus would have to leave around 9pm. Finally, could the furniture and overall look be improved? Yeah, BUT what they have now is more than good comfortable and can made do with.  Other than that, if you want to go on a chill date or even a nice spot to hang out this is a great place to go."}
