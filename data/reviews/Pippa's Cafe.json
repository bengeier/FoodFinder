{"text":"Great place to eat or just hang out and have a few cold ones."}
{"text":"Very good neighborhood sports bar.  Above average food, good drink specials and outstanding customer service.  I've been here several times and have had several different persons wait on me and the service has been stellar each time."}
{"text":"Avoid this establishment at all costs, unless you enjoy horrible service.  Sure, bingo night seems like a fun time, but how about the food?  We wouldn't know, since we never got that far.

Do they at least have refreshing drinks?  Hard to say - we didn't get to that point either.  Why were we in such a hurry?  We weren't - it's just that we were never served.

First, we were seated without menus. No one stopped by to take our drink order, even though we were sitting on the humid patio, the only space available.  After waiting twenty minutes, we asked for menus from a passing server.

She managed to scrounge up one menu for four of us.  At that point, we asked if we could at least place a drink order.  She promised to try to find \"our\" server.

About a minute later, the hostess who originally seated us without menus asked us if we really needed the one menu that we were sharing.

At that point, we said that we would not be needing the menu after all, since we would be leaving immediately, which we did.

Were they extremely busy at this time?  Does that excuse taking on additional clients, and then failing to serve them?  In my opinion, it does not.

Was this an isolated incident?  Hard to say.  If you want to be a guinea pig, then please check it out, and let us know how it goes.  And don't go on bingo night (although, the bingo caller is, in fact, excellent, so if you eat before hand, and bring your own drinks, bingo could be a lot of fun, which is something).

For us, we will not be returning, and our recommendation would be to avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Nice place to go and grab a quick bite to eat.  The food is nothing special but not bad.  I would recommend that they use a different type of cheese on the nachos.  We ordered them and when they came to the table, the cheese had dried up into one big clump of mess.  Also, please skip the chicken tenders!  They are dry and tasteless.  I would recommend their wraps because they seem pretty good.  Overall, I would go back if it was late and nothing else is open."}
{"text":"Food is a step above your typical bar fare BUT every time we have gone here, there has been something wrong. Even though some of these may not seem like big things since they have happened on separate occasions, they've added up to the point where we won't visit again:

Sit at the bar with a view of the kitchen: see the staff grab french fries with their hands (no gloves) not utensils.
Ask for a mug with my beer: it doesn't come.  
Ask for no cheese on a sandwich: it comes with cheese.
Ask for mayo on the side: sandwich comes with mayo. 
Order nachos: cheese isn't melted
Order take out: cashier keeps the coins when making change and only returns the bills. 

We have mentioned the issues to the owner because we want to see this business succeed, but this restaurant has lots to lose.  We are hoping a new restaurant goes into Edison Square that can give the Skybrook/Highland Creek crowd a better option. Maybe some competition is what Pippa's needs."}
{"text":"The bar is good but the whole restaurant is too small and crowded around the bar. The food is decent and what you would expect for the price. Caution if you are in the outside area in the spring as the farm nearby is fertilizing his field....and you can tell."}
{"text":"Turn down music so people can talk.  Food is great but have to yell at friends and so dies everyone else in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the NFL games!  Plenty of TVs and all the games are on.  Individual booths have their own private TVs.  Amazing!  Would give them 5 stars if they had more craft beer selections in tap."}
{"text":"Great food, service, environment and Bingo night!

Food is way above what you find at other sports bars. Wings, burgers, and sampler plates are super delicious.

Service is quick and food is always hot. Wait staff are friendly and polite.

Environment is better than most sports bars. TVs everywhere including 2 feet away from the booths inside. Outside patio area has both a covered and uncovered section. The music is chill and relaxed."}
{"text":"We prefer take out from here rather than dining in. Wings are good and fried pickles are a favorite too."}
{"text":"The California Burger is delicious !!!! A sports lovers dream! Plenty of TV's to watch your favorite team. There's a TV in every booth ."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in the Charlotte area. I come here about two to three times a week. The staff is really personable and attentive. If you're a new comer ask for Lacey she's super friendly and always recommends the best beers and food specials. I give 5 stars for the awesome staff, food, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We go there all the time. Close by and a great menu. Classic salad with grilled chicken is the best in town.  Lots of chicken! Pasta dishes are okay. Serving size is huge, be prepared to take half of it home. Wings are pretty good. Ribs were excellent!  Lots of meat and it fell off the bones! Service can be spotty depending on how crowded they are. The owner is very active in the community and sponsors several kids sports teams!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent! Rebecca and Katie.   Must try hot wings with sweet and spicy seasoning."}
{"text":"Good food with a good variety everything from burgers, salads and nachos to fish tacos and pasta. They also have live music and some great specials. It's close so my wife and I love to go to get away from the main stream and help the local business."}
{"text":"Went here Sunday for lunch.  I like the menu and the food is good, large portions and fair prices.   The service was pretty bad,  young server who really was just going through the motions with no personality."}
{"text":"Our large (20-25) group of retirees has met here three different months for lunch to take advantage of the birthday wings.  The food is very good and plentiful, and they accommodate our large group over at the The Sweet Spot (their breakfast restaurant right next door) since its been too warm to sit outside on the patio, but we order off of the Pippas' menu.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We only come here at lunch so consider it a \"lunch\" review.

Pippa's is a nicely done local sports bar.  There are tons of TVs both in the indoor area and in the covered patio. The booths have small TVs that you can change to any channel you choose.  

The food is standard bar fare. Burgers, sammiches, buffalo wings, etc.  I've tried a few things on the menu and have never been disappointed.  I've never been blown away either, but it is all about expectations.  The french fries are good and sweet potato fries provide another fried potato option.

Staff appears to be college women who are generally attentive and efficient."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a good location and looks like it would be a good place to watch football.  On the other hand, the food is average at best and I feel over priced for the quality.  I might go back for a beer but than again there are better places for that as well."}
{"text":"Sports bar with plenty of screens - Stopped in here as we had a restaurant.com coupon.  Service great....daily drink specials....regular bar menu...wings, jalapeno poppers, salads,....also dinner menu with steak dinners, chicken and pastas.  4 or 5 booths with priv ate flat screen TVs. WI FI available"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!! The choppy's family's mac n cheese, pimento burger, and Jessica wrap are my favorite!! I've been here so much and I've enjoyed the food every time! If you're reading this you bets try this place."}
{"text":"Nice casual place to grab a drink and relax. Just wish the food were better. I know it's difficult to keep an inventory of fresh food but what you end up with is reheated frozen food. And the cheese nachos are tortilla chips with melted cheddar. My point is, don't go for the food."}
{"text":"California avocado burger was really good. We go here from time to time. Some small things that would change the vibe would be to have staff have their personal discussions at the back of the house  as well as having a ladies toilet with the tank cover."}
{"text":"We've been infrequently frequenting Pippa's for 5 months, and I've always had a good experience there.  The crowd is mature and friendly (lots of Skybrooke and Highland Creek).  Food is great, mostly amped-up burgers and sandwiches, but decent entrees as well.  GET THE CLAMS!  No one has good clams in Charlotte, but this place gives you a generous helping of jumbos for a good price.  There are good drink specials every time we're there, and it seems like a great place to catch the games.  The management and staff are really great, and very friendly.  I've met and chatted with the owner and his family several times, and they go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  If you're drinking in Concord Mills/Highland Creek/Skybrooke, stop in here!"}
{"text":"I feel like I have found a hidden gem. The atmosphere is very relaxed and family-friendly, the food is amazing, and even the playlist was on point"}
{"text":"The service was super slow. We waited for an hour for the sampler platter. When the food came it was wrong. We waited 20 minutes for a tea refill. The restaurant was hot as if the air wasn't turned in. It was a very unpleasant experience and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm really mixed on this place. The service is awesome... but the food - well about the worst I've ever had. I've been here 3 times... so it wasn't just an off day. The two stars are all for service. Plus it was fairly expensive for a burger.

The burger (ordered medium well) appeared to be from a frozen patty and was raw in the center (yes, I mean raw) - the only thing medium well was the outside of the patty. The chili was about 1/2 water - yea served that way. The red potato salad was horrible, tasted like sour cream mixed with old baye seasoning. Hey, the tea was good. 

Other visits: fish and chips... literally 3/4 to an inch of batter. Yuck! I removed the batter and I had a pile left almost as big as the original order that was served. The fries were from a frozen bag of fries (my guess)."}
{"text":"Never have had a miss at Pippas, Philly sandwich was great, burger was great, Bang Bang shrimp was great, my son loves the pretzel bites. Great local non-chain. I go here all the time and I love it!"}
{"text":"Pippa's is the best if you want to get away from the main stream, chain restraunts offered in the Concord Mills area.  Awesome food; welcoming, attentive wait staff; great local beer selection, and #patio. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Went tonight for dinner and they had the hostess stand out front and it was apparently being manned by two young girls who were standing there doing nothing while everyone just stood and waited to put their name in. No acknowledgement of people waiting, no sense of urgency to do anything. We walked away-it was ridiculous."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this sports bar. It's close to my neighborhood so we frequent often. Thy have live music, trivia, bingo and great food! Not your typical sports bar food. They do specials on the weekends and often serve up delicious seafood. The Pippas Classic salad is my go to, but the Gorgonzola wrap is a great bet as well. The bartenders are nice, the atmosphere is great and the owner is friendly and accommodating. A great spot for groups too, with lots of tvs, beer towers, daily drink specials and cornhole!

People said they don't have craft beer - they do have some. They have OMB Copper and a Sugar Creek White Ale currently (updated: March)"}
{"text":"There's really nothing good about this place except for the location. The beer selection and wine selection are weak. 
They were out of everything including plates. They were out of celery for the chicken wings, out of the \"sweet white\" wine selection and basically concocted something in the back. Then we ate our apps of paper plates Which we had to ask for. The boneless chicken wings were chicken less. They resembled crunchy pebbles with pseudo wing sauce.  The service was awful and the server was grossing me out with her face piercing. Very unappetizing and unsanitary. I will never come back here again which really is unfortunate since its in a great location and close to my house."}
{"text":"Service is great other than that they fall flat. I ordered the prime rib medium rare and it came out well done. Took about 10-15 minutes to get a beer and they weren't even busy. I've been there quite a few times because my wife likes their wraps but it's not my choice of places to go. Beer selection needs help to. It's easy to see that they are a Bud bar because everything inside has a Bud logo on it."}
{"text":"Yeah, I love this place. Whether its slow or busy. The food is good. I noticed that some changes have been made to the menu and there are lots of events now.

I love that you can watch whatever you want on your own TV. The owners are super great and I hope this place stays around for awhile."}
{"text":"So-so sandwiches.  Their other items may be better so ill try them again. A bit pricey for what it was.  

Definitely worth another try.  I want to.like this place !  I notice they frequently have firemen/police officers eatting in. I like they must offer them a discount.  :-)"}
{"text":"The Good, The Bad & The Ugly. 

The Good. Easy to get to from my home. Very clean dining room and more TVs than an epileptic could handle.  My sandwich was good.  I like the flavored garlic spread they use on the bun and good quality deli meat. 

The Bad. Went in during a non rush hour and ordered a sandwich. Nothing fancy. Not a culinary stretch. One other person came in about 2 minutes after I sat and ordered. Well, his order came out before mine and he are and was finished by the time I got mine. No warning or I'm sorry it took so long. My side item was cold and the bread was crispy on top from sitting under the heat lamp too long. So I don't think it was necessarily that the food took too long but the server forgot about me. Like I said it was after their normal lunch rush and they were rushing to get dinner service set up. I can respect that. 

The Ugly. Nothing really to go here. I will probably try again. Not sure when but I will. 

Side note:  menu is standard bar food fare. Above average in my opinion judging by some product boxes I saw. Not the cheap frozen crap that you'd find at a chain store."}
{"text":"Delicious food and specials!  Staff is always friendly and helpful! Enjoy going there to hang out with friends, watch a game and have a good meal."}
{"text":"Way to cliquish for me service not the best was expecting more because we live in the area and had heard good things the owner is an ass very arrogant I don't like places where you are overlooked in a service industry running to a 2 dollar tip and just missed so much more definitely not going back EVER"}
{"text":"There was a packed house tonight,  but the service was still good.  The chili was amazing and the smoked wings are probably the best around.  All food came out to temperature. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place! Good drink specials and great food. The service was excellent. Plenty of flat screen tvs. Comfortable seating at the bar. Or if you prefer a booth you will have your own personal flat screen TV. The location is hard to find, but its in a plaza that is very new and looks that are building a lot more in the area soon."}
{"text":"Pippa's is my local go to wing joint. If I still drank, it would also be my local go to beer joint too. What I love is that even a rowdy sports bar is family friendly enough to take my 14 year old daughter to for dinner. Eat in or take out, we have always enjoyed the wings. We order them with Big Dave's hot sauce, it's a great blend of flavor and fire. The fries are always crispy which is always a plus. Unless you like them soggy, then I guess you don't really understand how to enjoy fries."}
{"text":"Family we went with swore by it. I got a rare NY strip, I ALWAYS eat rare steak...love steak. This one came out straight raw, some parts of the steak was visibly not touched by heat...but whatever, I like it like that. It tasted bitter, I thought it smelled funny. I had four others smell it, without saying anything and they were not brave enough to taste it. The waitress comes back \"we looked, smelled and tasted that steak and nothing was wrong except a little undercooked.\" I said whatever, I dont care to pay for it...I dont want it back. Few minutes later she comes back, \"there is a manure plant right around the corner, maybe when you were smelling it the door was open.\" SERIOUSLY??!!? Just leave it alone, dont actively try to argue with me. 

Two people got the wings, the first ones were awesome...perfectly crispy, etc. Second one came out 5-10 min later and the skin was mushy and oily. The waitress explained that when they cooked the first batch the oil gets cold, so when they cooked the second ones, thats how they come out. That one, we did get new ones to go...but what the crap with the excuses!  

From what I have heard its a great neighborhood spot, and I will probably go back. 100% positive it was the waitress. Sucks that my two year old put us at 8, so she got her 20%...probably why she didnt care, pretty sad."}
{"text":"Pippa's has pretty good bar food.  The blackened tilapia wrap, wings, and onion rings are all good.  They have TVs in each of the booths that you can control.  Problem is they only have 5 booths.  The place is very small and not laid out very well.  There's a table right in front of the door.  If you get seated there ask to be moved.  Also, you basically have to walk through a storage area to get to the bathroom, and if you're sitting at the bar your stool is constantly being kicked by people walking by.

The service is the biggest miss.  It's a bunch of teenagers to early 20's who congregate in the kitchen area by the end of the bar.  Either that or they at the bar or a table talking to the regulars.  

All in all it's not a bad place.  If you're in the Highland Creek/Skybrook area it's very convenient.  Just be prepared for hit or miss service."}
{"text":"Visited friends in the area and they suggested this spot. It was very good. The service was excellent, the food outstanding and the prices were very reasonable. If I lived here, I would definitely return. My only suggestion would be to cut back on the butter in the green beans and cook them a tad bit longer."}
{"text":"This is your standard sports bar with the expected bar food and typical beer list. The wraps were good, the service was great, and they have a nice patio outside. It's pretty loud inside, but that's to be expected. They seemed to have, literally, every different sport on TV and the booths each have their own TV so you can watch what you want."}
{"text":"After my initial couple experiences, I have avoided this place for the past couple years.  This past weekend, I was driving by and decided to stop.  They have a new menu, with lots of new interesting choices.  I went with the chicken marsala.  The taste was excellent, the chicken was perfectly lightly fried and the mushroom wine sauce was outstanding.   But, baked potato?  WTF? Normally, the dish is served with flat egg noodles, or some other pasta......  I asked for pasta and she said there would be an upcharge?   Geez.   My wife had the bang bang shrimp tacos and reports that it was about a 6 out of 10.   She did say that there was little \"Bang bang\" --- no kick.    I would actually go back for the chick marsala.    They have wing night on Mondays, so I am going to hit that one of these Mondays......."}
{"text":"Good pub food. I will say they have fresh items. The salads are great,burgers are fresh. For a bar they have the best kids meals. Grilled chicken tenders and steamed veggies."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It was a hidden gem for sure. During football season it would be the place to be since they have booths with your own personal TV and remote. The food was good. Ingredients seemed to be local and fresh. I didn't try the wings, but they look really good and their prices on the wings are good as well. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My son and I just got finished eating there, I had the burger and my son had wings and homemade chips. This place is awesome. Best kept secret around. Great service, hot food and lots of quality. Friendly owners, can't wait to go back. They also own the sweet spot next door, my son asked if we could go back in the morning to eat breakfast. Mike & Riley"}
{"text":"First time wasn't so great, server was terrible. The chicken wings were drenched in oil. But the wraps were really good! I love the location of this place, and how it was a local business but it's a hit or miss. Defiantly will be coming back for the wraps but that's about it."}
{"text":"Stopped in one lazy afternoon to check out the close, local fare in the neighborhood.  We were pleasantly welcomed by the staff, taken aback a the amount of LCD panels on the walls, and surprised by the food.  I'll be going back again, to try some other stuff on the menu; stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Love that each booth has its own TV, especially when we take our 3 young kids. Has a great neighborhood bar scene. It's practically in our neighborhood and we go at least once a week whether with kids or date night! Atmosphere is awesome, but food is just average at best. I do wish they would add some more square footage."}
{"text":"This is a local watering hole that has pretty good food. I'm a fan of the sampler platter which they allow you to substitute items you may not like. The servers are beautiful and super friendly. I'll eat there everyday if I could."}
{"text":"This place is SUPER LOUD and the food here is not that great. Prices are okay compared to other pubs. This is a place to watch football and hang out. This is not a place to eat with family and friends. You will not be able to hold a conversation due to the extremely loud volume. There is a kids area in the back for playing games."}
{"text":"I always have really great food here! My favorite thing is the Cali Wrap. I have brought many friends here and they also enjoy the atmosphere and food as well. I think the appetizers are perfect for watching a game and I may think about coming by here during panther season."}
{"text":"I love this place . I go there every night for bingo . Foods great and we always get the beer tower . I definitely recommend the RIDDLE sauce for the wings !"}
{"text":"Local bar and grill in my hood of Highland Creek & Sky Brook. Great place to have a cold beer. Occasionally they have food specials. Just don't order the wings. The worse in town. The size of my thumb."}
{"text":"We always come here when we visit charlotte. Great atmosphere, excellent quality bar food and the staff is friendly. Portions are HUGE so you get your money's worth! Great drink selection also! Get the wings you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers!  It's my son's favorite place, but with a TV in every booth, how can you go wrong?  I just wish there was more square footage.  It fills up pretty fast."}
{"text":"I have been dining here for years and the experience has steadily declined to the point that I'll never come back. Came in at 12:30pm on a Friday and didn't get served food until 1:30pm and it's not busy. The service sucked and so did the food. Got a BLT wrap and there hardly any bacon on it. Avoid this place if you can."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. The service is awful and the food quality has taken a turn for the worse. Wont be coming back anytime soon sorry to say. This place used to be better."}
{"text":"The beer selection is great i love it. The food could be better i just cant stand frozen beef patties and thats what you get if you order there burgers. There french dip i must say is wonderful and the staff more times then not are friendly. Not bad but not the best in the area."}
{"text":"I have quite a few friends who live in Skybrook, and this restaurant is very close by. It seemed like everything they had on the menu was yummy to eat, a very typical simple restaurant.  It was also dog friendly which was nice."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good food, this is not the place. I ordered a Greek salad (pretty basic stuff). When it got to my table the salad was loaded with wilted lettuce; far from what they claimed to be fresh. The only explanation the \"very young\" server had was \"they told me it was made to order\"...hmm, interesting. Also, an off-duty server resting her bare feet on top of a dining table in the same area where patrons/customers eat doesn't exactly capture the idea of a casual environment.

However, if you want to drink a few adult beverages, catch some eye candy (young women in tight shorts or yoga pants aka the servers and bartenders)...this spot works."}
{"text":"Nice local watering hole for the highland creek neighborhood.  They have decent drink specials and the food is great for bar food.  Wing night is always tasty.  It can get crowded at the place is not very big, but they definitely utilized the patio nicely, having it closed in for use all year round.  This is a great place to watch sports as they have TV's everywhere.  Service is always good as well.  If your in the hood definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sports bar with good food.  Lot's of televisions to watch whatever sports you like.  Fills up fast when big sporting events are televised."}
{"text":"Met some friends out on Friday night.  I live in Charlotte but originally from the Concord area and I had heard great things about this place. We sat outside on their awesome patio, which was equipped with heaters.  We didn't order any entrees but we almost ordered every appetizer (or it sure felt that way) on the menu! The wings were good.  Pretzel bites were  tasty!  Fried pickles were da' BOMB...so definitely order those! We also had the sampler.  My favorites from there were the Jalapeno poppers.  The southwest egg rolls stole the show!  I can't wait to go back and order those just as my meal.  DELICIOUS!  Service was extremely slow so I'm hoping this improves next time I visit. We even had two waitresses."}
{"text":"Pippa's has pretty decent food.  The service is almost always great.  The beer selection is terrible!  Craft beer is what's hot.  If you're not serving it, you're just plain lazy.  They could at least tap a local breweries keg and carry a few crafts in the can and bottle.  I won't return for this reason alone.   Eastfield Bar and Grill right down the street has a nice selection of craft beer and has great food.  I would just go there."}
{"text":"Food is still consistently good, love that they have added local craft beers to the bar but... I have noticed this summer a new group of servers. They spend more time chatting with one another and 'friends' eating/visiting. Things are frequently forgotten during orders; overall attention to detail s not there like it use to be the past 2 years. 

Update** service and food has returned (consistently) back to the same level it was earlier this year! It is wonderful to have the old Pipas back that we have grown to love."}
{"text":"Great bar and food for Sunday football. It is so unassuming with a name like Cafe. When you walk in, it's definitely a bar. But the food selections make it more \"cafe\". We ordered a few beers, the Carolina nachos, and traditional wings, so I can't comment on the cafe food. However, the bar food was fantastic. They have TVS at every table, and on every inch of the walls."}
