{"text":"Was craving Molcajete and decided to try this place. It was alright I guess. The beef was overcooked and tough. The salsa it was in was mediocre. Service was less than satisfactory also."}
{"text":"I really loved their food well cooked excellent flavor and fair price! I had a molcagete and a seafood sampler I forgot it's name though The staff was very friendly awesome service! Would recommended to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Yummy. It's my first time. I really liked the spicy broth and chips and salsa. The service was friendly. It was a bit slow and I didn't see the sever after she took our order but other servers checked on us. The Prepared oysters were really fresh and delicious. We also tried the Morcajete cielo mar y Tierra.  Sorry for butchering the spelling. They serve large portions. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been to all the seafood Mexican places in Arizona and this spot is worth the drive . Portions are Hugh and everything was the Buumba.  I was raised on the islands so I know when seafood is Fresh. Hands Up or Down whatever This place is 100 stars!! This is my second time repeat customer and won't my last. My seafood spot for life"}
{"text":"Glad to see more folks are trying out this local gem, the seafood broth soup they serve before every meal is worth stopping in for! Very hearty portions, fresh and authentic too! Clean and fast service."}
{"text":"We just tried this deliciously authentic Mexican seafood restaurant tonight, and left muy feliz :)! Chips (thin and crispy) and salsa were good (better than a lot of chains), and they took care of a specialized order of adding shrimp to a fish filet with mushroom cream sauce. The shrimp were big and not over-cooked. We went on the weekend and the live mariachi music was fun, but super loud (and I usually love loud music). Service was friendly and prices were really reasonable! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Initial Impression:  Easy to find, next to a laundry mat.  Not enough parking. Well lit & marketed.   Pros:  Not overcrowded Was clean Seat yourself Alot of staff on hand Mariachis Music Food was ok Staff friendly   Cons: Bathrooms were quite dirty & dingy Food took a long time to get to us Did not have any desserts  Overpriced food Seats were ripped & falling apart  Experience: We were greeted after a few min of standing around. We chose our seating, we ordered the Shrimp  Aguachile, which was really tasty. As expected. I ordered a Ceviche Shrimp tostada & it was not good. It tasted like raw shrimp marinated in an adobo powered chilli or Cayenne Chilli powder sauce. It was so awful we couldn't eat it. We ordered dessert for my son.. the only thing he wanted.. & they said they did have ice cream.. but then when the food came out they said... they had no desserts of any kind.. at all...very disappointing. Our waitress was soo busy & her management was just sitting around doing nothing... way to go team work. She did her best...   Overall: The lack of dessert was a let down & the food was overpriced for the quality & taste. I must say this isn't a place I'd like to re visit.. Quite the generic taste... & not worth what you pay.  The virgin mango margaritas were super rich but the presentation was above& beyond."}
{"text":"The place was fun ! We had my daughters birthday dinner here ...lots of great music and drinks! The food was descent.the drinks were my favorite by far !"}
{"text":"Tried this place before and it was OK.  Bit when I came here with my wife today,  she ordered the fish taco,  which was greasy and the filet was dry.  She wanted to get something else,  but the staff essentially ignored us.  Sorry but we aren't returning.  Edit: spoke with the manager who comped our meal.  He did apologize.  Upped the rating from one to two stars."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and salsa, but service was lack luster. Ate here because it was close to our hotel. Would try again if back in Mesa."}
{"text":"Not sure how to rate my experience here because we were such a large group (about 25 of us) and this was the only place that said they could accommodate us in the immediate area - and I know it's not easy to work with a party that large.  The staff was friendly and did their best to be attentive, but everything took a very long time.  Our tables were ready for us, but when we were seated they put the soups down in the center of the table and a lot of people didn't know what they were.  No one told us anything, and then we couldn't find our server for a while.  She was really trying hard to get everyone what they needed, but again the service was a bit slow.  The food came and I was definitely underwhelmed.  I got the fish taco because I figured I couldn't go wrong.  It was just meh.  I made it into a combo and I'm glad I did because the taco was kind of small.  I thought it was odd that they charged $8 for a single fish taco... but can't really say I have compared prices (since we're from CA).  Tried the margarita, too.  It was... different than anything I've ever had?  Possibly had sprite in it?  Not sure that I was a fan though...  Paying also took a very long time and I was unclear of the process.  Some people were paying at the front, others were having  checks picked up at the table.  But the entire process took us a very long time (but again, I am giving them the benefit of the doubt because we were such a large party).    The only other thing of note was that the bathroom was especially small and rundown (dirty?) - which always bothers me and makes me question how clean the entire place is.  Probably wouldn't try it again."}
{"text":"I ordered a breaded fish fillet, not impressed, the fillet was horrible. I had to ask for something else, so I tried the carne asada which was ok. The rice was also ok. Oh and they have a cool juke box but when it played music, too loud @noon I get it, party time but it's noon not club hours which by the way seem like they have a karaoke area. Mariscos el Rey doesn't really fit the bill if your fish fillet sucks more than a mcfish burger."}
{"text":"First time at Mariscos El Ray last night, it was such a treat. Our server Tristan was fun and playful more importantly very helpful answering questions and very prompt with service! Ramon was also very attentive, he at one point even poured the rest of my beer into my Michelada, as he swiftly walked by.   The food was so fresh and delicious. Between me and my girlfriend we ordered a platter of oysters (Ostiones Preparados), a chevice and a tostada! Our oysters were HUGE, fresh tasting and a delight. Other two dishes were just as wonderful. We only ate about half the ceviche ( yay for leftovers today.) servings are plentiful.   We will be back great food, great service and easy atmosphere. Has a very nice chill and relax with a delicious meal vibe."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for mariscos with some other friends. Parking was not a problem though it seemed like a small strip mall.   As usual with most of the Mexican restaurants I go to and probably the vast majority of Mexican restaurants, there was complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was delicious and spicy. We also received a complimentary seafood soup which was very good.  We had quite a bit to eat. I had about a half dozen of the prepared oysters which had avocado, scallop, shrimp, onions and oyster. I dribbled some lime and a little salt onto it and it was delicious. I had some aguachile on tostadas which was excellent.   The alcohol was well priced and I had a strawberry margarita as well that was good. Overall, I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I came down from Cali & came to eat here on a Saturday 1 the food is goo 2 the Banda that was there was good & just the vibe they make you feel is as if you were in Mexico ! I loved it here definitely recommend this place to anyone !"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best but this place by far the rudest manager I've ever experienced. I originally ordered  a tostada de ceviche (camaron) but there was something in the seasoning that was off to me and unlike any ceviche I had ever tasted (and trust me, I've eaten a lot of different styles) so I asked if I could send it back and order something else. The waitress was very sweet and said she would check. When she came back, her manager was with her and he asked me what was wrong with the food. I told him that I didn't like the flavor that the ceviche had and instead of listening to me he proceeded to name all the ingredients it was made with. I told him that I just wanted to switch my dish to something different because even though the seasonings he named seemed to be what I've normally seen used in ceviche (minus the celery salt), there  was a flavor that I did not like. He then proceeded to rudely tell me that \"maybe my palate was not ready for ceviche because the ceviche he served was just fine\". To be clear, my palate loves good ceviche! I have eaten ceviche from different states in Mexico, Puerto Rico, and a many different places here in the valley and not once did it taste anything similar to what I had here. It would not have been a big deal had the rude manager not offended me by the way he handled my request. The poor waitress was obviously mortified at how he handled the situation and was super apologetic when we asked for her to just box my new order (camarones culichi, which were very oily and only 8 small shrimp in the entire dish.) and bring us our bill. Never will go back again."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! For a northerner with a diverse group here on business, the environment and service added to the pleasurable experience. Thank you!"}
{"text":"La comida está bien! Nada nuevo pero el servicio es lento y no muy bueno! Sele olvidaron las tortillas ;(.  Y no regreso a checar cómo está la comida Ni nada por el estilo!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time had the molcajete ala diabla was really pretty spicy and flavorful the waitress was very attentive the only thing that sucked was that our order took so long to get to us apparently there was an issue with their system and our order was never put in...so it took about 40 min for half of our food to come and another 20 for the rest..I can't blame it on the waitress being it wasn't her fault but for this reason I can give this place another star."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim... was not disappointed! Service was awesome, food was delicious. We ordered the ceviche and shrimp tacos with cheese and all of it was amazing.  Definitely recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Don't even bother with the medium shrimp cocktail...go for large.  It was amazing and great for those on diets.  Literally the best Mexican food I've ever had.  Also, I usually walk away from Mexican food feeling sick from all the fried foods and cheese.  This time I felt great, but still full.  I'm doing Weight Watchers, and found the shrimp cocktail is a great way to have Mexican food and still stay on the diet.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Las tostadas son de le mejor!!! Siempre ordenamos el ceviche mixto y yo tostadas de agua chile verde... Mirna Es la mejor mesera !!! Es un placer!! Y siempre saca todo PERFECTO nunca hace errores y todo lo que recomienda es delicioso!!! Siempre que vengo (casi dos veces a la semana) a ella la espero! Nos trata muy bien!!!"}
{"text":"Second time here and I'm even more in love than the first time! The carne asada street tacos were amazing. My friend got the green chili burrito and loved ittttt. Bloody Mary's and michaladas are spot on! Their chips and salsa have to be on my top 5 favorite out of all places I've been. I highly recommend this place! Thank you for being 4 minutes from my home! Lol"}
{"text":"Very good food! Nice clean environment, very pleasant servers. Food took a little long than expected but overall good"}
{"text":"Gringo friendly staff. Prices are comparable to other marisco restaurants in the area. I thought the music was a bit loud, but it tends to be in these places. Although it seems pricey, portion sizes of campechana and soup were large with lots of seafood. Flavors were great. I really had to ding at least one star due to an issue with my 7 mares soup (my go to mariscos dish). Fish still had the skin and bones on it. I spent most of the meal picking out soggy fish skin and bones. Didn't get all the bones and choked on quite a few. I'd go back, but I doubt if I'd order the soup again."}
{"text":"Well, I said that I'd return and give this place another shot, so I did.  This time, I tried out one of their cocos- it's basically a hollowed-out coconut filled with tasty seafood and chilled broth. Alongside it was served the liquid from the coconut in a glass, and the meat scraped out from within. One coconut would have been enough to share between two people, and I have to say it was an amazing experience.   The ostiones preparados were just perfect, as they were the first time I came here. Big, fat, meaty oysters covered in ceviche, avocado, onion, and a tiny bit of sauce.   One of the people in our party ordered a tostada, and it looked really good too. Piled high with tasty seafood, with a nice crisp tortilla underneath... dammit... now I'm hungry again...  Anyhow, for mariscos, this place is as good as it gets. I look forward to returning here and eating again, I just have to try new things and not eat the same things all the time."}
{"text":"Visited 4/19/2018 This is a nice little Mexican Seafood Restaurant. Located in Mesa AZ it's a local favorite.   Plenty of seating booths and tables.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  The menu has a good selection of different seafood dishes. One of our party had the Steak Tacos day said they were wonderful.  We all tried the Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Peppers.  They were quite Amazing.  I would have them again for sure. The Coconut dish was also a winner.  And the Shrimp Alfredo seem to be pretty good also. All in all the food was pretty good except for the salsa which was very watery not much like a true salsa.   I will try this place again the next time I'm in Mesa."}
{"text":"Excellent Sea Food, ambiance was great also the Service, the Food has a very good taste I oredered Octopus and Shrimp Coctel and it was fantastic will be retuning there for sure. All ingredients were perfect I was very satisfied thank you Mariscos el Rey."}
{"text":"Stood at the front for about 4 minutes. No one greeted me or even knowledge that I was there. I ended up just walking out. What a same they have amazing food. Serves not so much."}
{"text":"Delicious. Inexpensive. Spacious. Great Service.   Tostadas are real tostadas, no filled w/ cucumber and other veggies; if you ask for a tostada de pulpo or camaron, that's exactly what you get, no fillers. Good amount too, 2 tostadas will fill you up, unless you like to eat a lot."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a no star I would ! Sat down for twenty min and no service ?!! Then mentioned it manager and he had nothing to say so I just left"}
{"text":"This place just opened up by my place and I decides to give it a try. So the inside decor was very clean and clearly had a theme. As I opened up the menu, I was a little surprised on the prices, a little high, but further reading it, the portions were quite large. I went with a more of a cost effective choice, I got the half dozen oyster,  and three seafood Tacos. I'm thinking  I should have gotten two tacos, they were much bigger than I thought. Service was ok."}
{"text":"I was shipped out here from CT for work and was hungry.  I was going to try a local burger restaurant...but I enjoy seafood and Mexican food...but never together.  I have now eaten here four times in five days and love their food. The spicy shrimp burrito...delicious and huge.   The marlin quesadilla.....thick and tasty.  The salsa with the complimentary tortilla chips was odd to me since usually eat the jarred stuff, but you can play with the eight hot sauces while you wait.  Some nights they serve a complementary fish broth appetizer.....so good!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best place to go for taco Tuesday, period.  The tacos are really good, especially the shrimp diablas.  They also bring a soup with the chips and salsa that is amazing.  And get Tristen for a waiter, he's one of the best."}
{"text":"Decided we needed shrimp, but it was midnight... Mariscos El Rey to the rescue.  The portions were large, and the quality was great.  The one thing that really amazed me from a strip mall Mexican joint was the service.  You need to give the young guy that works late at night a raise!  We just came from a fancy dinner at a well known chef's restaurant and all I could think is how their service paled in comparison to how we were treated here. He made sure we knew what we were getting into, was personable, polite, attentive but not annoying, and the manager even popped out to say hello.  Overall way better than expected in every aspect."}
{"text":"Had the terra y mar (surf & turf) it was delicious. I split it with my husband and we couldn't finish it all. They had live music, which we enjoyed."}
