{"text":"Took a look at the menu, and thought \"this should be good\" We ordered the open-faced prime rib sandwich and the California chicken sandwich. The prime rib (requested medium) was way over cooked and very tough, it was cold in the middle and burnt on top.  The sweet potato fries were just Ok, nothing to brag about.  The chicken in the chicken sandwich was also over cooked.  Even though Coleslaw was ordered with the chicken sandwich, it came with French fries and no slaw.  The fries were interesting, if you like the taste of fish. Not sure if they had not changed the frying oil, or were really cooking fish in it.

Also had ice tea which had a bitter taste from either inferior tea, or letting it steep to long.  In either case, not pleasant to drink."}
{"text":"This restaraunt across the street from the Boulder City Hotel on Arizona Street deserves more attention than it gets.  The Zaloof roasted eggplant appetizer with warm pita bread was great.  The salad could been more Mediterranean like.  Crispy romaine lettuce and a slice of tomato and cucumber

The fresh grilled salmon was excellent.  A little bit over cooked but great flavor.

Nice dinner musicl

Plan to go next door for a locally brewed beer"}
{"text":"REOPENED ...May 1st...Awesome food with delicious selections..Friendly environment...a cool place to relax!"}
{"text":"HOW DARE ANYONE RATE THIS \"RESTAURANT\" HIGHER THAN A NEGATIVE 15 STARS!!!

Ab-so-lute fuckery.

My sisters and I went here one afternoon upon my sister's suggestion since it had such high reviews on Yelp. Mistake.

The place was empty except for the bartender sitting at a table outside, a waitress in flip flops, and some cook who looked to be about 19. 

No lights were on so the only light came from the windows - too bad it was raining outside so the whole restaurant was dark and grey. The floors were sticky and the furniture looked like second hand crap since it was so beat up. I don't know how a place with zero customers does so much damage to their 1992-era tables and chairs unless they were from a consignment restaurant supply store. The tile floors were cracked and the bar area had some Grecian columns going on. The whole ambiance was just outdated, mismatched, and dingy.

We were served filets of charcoal with a petroleum spread aka burnt pita bread with butter packets as an appetizer. I'm no Anthony Bourdain, but I tend to not enjoy things that taste like an ash tray.

Everything on the menu was Cheesecake Factory prices, which was just a joke considering the quality of the dining room. I ordered the caesar salad. Three words is all I will use to describe the flavor of my meal: Nail Polish Remover. 

The water tasted like it was poured at the source, the source being a porta-potty. It was gross and I only took two drinks - one to taste it and the other to wash down my acetone-glazed pieces of lettuce.

Basically, this place was a disaster and how they pay their rent is beyond me."}
{"text":"Great moroccan food, the chicken tajine and the lamb kabobs are amazing. They serve really great burgers and steaks as well."}
{"text":"Nice staff, but slow on the service. We were out to celebrate our first anniversary. We had our very first date in Boulder City so my guy brought me here. I wanted a glass of sparkling wine, they were out. I ordered the Chicken Marsala, it was very bland no flavor. The wait staff never came back to refill my water. Not sure if I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"Where to begin? How about the partition that has been put up to enlarge the bar area and decrease the floor space for dining. There are more tables, but because of the dimensions, the dining area has ton of standing waves. Flat surfaces funneled to a large open room. Tapestries would be nice to absorb the sound so that one can talk without having everyone hear. 
Second, the Chef insists on having impressive sounding entrees, however, his wait staff has not been properly educated on how to pronounce.
45 minutes, I have been waiting, since I was seated. The bread was over reheated, to the point of being dry. No teaspoon when I ordered ice tea. Salmon chowder was good, I was told. Salad was fine. Too long of a wait for the entree. The prices are a bit steep for the quality of service.
The saut√©d sole was tasteless. The rice over cooked, to the point of the edges being hard. The chicken Marsala was served with thin chicken tenders, not full chicken breast. The sirloin was nothing to write home to mother about. Certainly nothing worthy of the hour wait from seating til served. I did like the garlic mashed potato.
As a tip for the owner: instead of telling me the wait was because the nature of the  food or because of people ahead of you. That is your fault for not managing correctly. Maybe apologize and say that we just re-opened and were are working out the kinks. 

I used to love this place, when they served a mix of Moroccan and American, now it is just garbage. Please do us a favor and just go bankrupt. You suck!!!! Take a good thing and F it up. Why do so many people believe in fixing something that was not broken. If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would, but unfortunately, YELP is far too nice. I would not even cross the street to eat at this place, even if it was the last place. I would rather eat a dead carcass, out in the desert."}
{"text":"Food was disgusting. Waitress brought my bill and never returned, Lady at the front said my waitress was in a business meeting? Horrible service and bad food. Will never be back and im telling everyone to go to Evans. Must has been 15-20 staff members just standing around talking."}
{"text":"\"Sink water, cigarettes and acetone.\" Those were the words that came out the mouths of my sisters to describe the flavors of the \"food\" at Big Horn yesterday. 

I am so livid after paying $34 and some change for this horrific slop. I hope every P.O.S. that wrote a 4 or 5 star review for this place goes to Hell. Every time a person writes a review giving high marks, when they know the food is mediocre, they're swindling money from future customers, even if they're not the ones receiving it. 

After leaving without ordering at Pit Stop, I took my two sisters out to lunch while my dad and brother went fishing at Lake Mead. Eff. What a mistake. It was 5:20 PM when we walked in yesterday (7/10/11) and it was a ghost town. I would have felt like such an ass turning around and walking out when the waitress looked excited that somebody finally walked in, so we took a table. Mistake.

Really, $7.98 for the kids' meals? 3 chicken strips and fries for a 5 year old cost me $8?! Between the completely empty restaurant, and the bizarre menu mix with prices that don't match the ambiance or the location ($4 to add chicken to a Caesar salad?!) We should have walked out right then. 

We all ordered waters. My youngest sister (the 5 year old) took a drink, scrunched up her nose and said, \"This tastes like sink water.\" The water tasted dirty and full of chlorine. You could actually smell the water. My other sister (21 year old) said she wasn't going to drink it unless she had to wash something down. It was horrible.

So we ordered 1 kid's meal with chicken strips, my sister ordered a plain Caesar salad ($7.98) and I ordered the chicken tajine ($15.98.) My dish came with either minestrone soup (how an Italian soup goes with anything else on the menu is beyond me) or a side salad. I ordered the side salad with blue cheese dressing.

My salad looked fine. The dressing tasted like it was one of those Ken's dressing packets, even though it was served in a little tin cup. The waitress brought out pita bread and butter for the table with my salad. The pita bread had strange little burn marks all over it. My sister took a bite and said \"this tastes like a cigarette.\" The bread had the weirdest burnt smoky taste - like the grill had caught fire. I honestly think the bread had been heated in a burnt pan. It was gawd awful and had a funky burnt smell, even on the parts that weren't burnt. 

When the food came out, I was ticked. This tajine looked like a scoop of rice pilaf, green olives stuffed with pimentos and a boneless, skinless chicken breast that had been boiled in water with turmeric. The only thing that looked decent was the green zucchini... until I turned it over. The zucchini on the side facing up looked like it had been lightly sauteed. I flipped all the pieces over and SURPRISE! every piece was dark brown or full on black. Yep, apparently they didn't think I would be able to notice when tasting the food that it was burnt. 

The rice was BLAND. I added a ton of butter packets (from the cigarette pita basket) and salt and pepper. Nothing could add any flavor to it. I took a bite of the chicken. It wasn't seasoned. (When I brought it home in a to go box, my mom took one look at it and agreed it wasn't seasoned.) I've made tajine before - I'm some white chick from Texas and I can make it 1,000 times better than this place. Tajine (Tagine) is supposed to be this wonderful, fragrant, sweet and savory dish containing diced meat, carrots, peppers, eggplant, cinnamon, allspice, garlic, turmeric, cumin, cayenne, dried fruit (raisins or apricots) and onions. This... this was not tajine. This was crap. 

My sister took a bite of her Caesar salad and said \"this dressing tastes like acetone.\" Why would dressing taste like acetone (nail polish remover)? Because it is rancid. The only thing decent we all ate was the three of us shared the kids meal - which came with a little tin cup of Kraft ranch dressing. It has a distinct fake taste.  

This was by far the WORST meal I've ever had. This empty restaurant, with its sticky tables, flip-flop clad waitress, overpriced, burnt, dirty food needs a date with Gordon Ramsey on Kitchen Nightmares. The fact that nobody is coming in should be a huge red herring to the owners that the food is awful and the prices are outrageous. 
The quality of the food is lacking so much that this food should be going for max, $5 a plate. 

I have never been so livid and felt so ripped off in all my life after eating at a restaurant. I want my money back. I hope the owner is reading this review and takes note. My receipt is the one that has the word's \"I'm going to review this place on Yelp.com later.\" Please refund my money because the food was atrocious. Shameful!"}
{"text":"Very good food and great service. Me loves the zalook appetizer, the lamb anything and the Chicken Tajine. The lentil soup is mighty tasty. My DH loves the hummus and the salmon and the souvlaki. We are regulars here, and have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"After a visit to the damn we were looking for a lunch spot off the beaten path.  Yelp, Urbanspoon, Trip Advisor all gave too many suggestions, finally just threw a dart and landed on Big Horn.  I was pleasantly suprised  to find hummus and souvlaki on the menu.  Good food, If you like that kind of thing."}
{"text":"nice and kind waitress, for the food... you just cant ask for more since it's in a little town... fires is ok lo!"}
