{"text":"It was just OK. Ambiance and lighting all good. Women's restroom was nice. I like the airy feel to this place. Recommended we try the chicken parm bites. At $10, that was super pricey for what we got - burned blobs. And there was some dark lettuce-y stuff at the bottom of the serving boat thing, but we couldn't tell whether it was sauce or lettuce or something just plain dark. I'm not a craft beer person, but others seemed to enjoy it. I had a Riesling and it was served in a sampler beer glass. All in all, OK. All men in here had facial hair. Odd."}
{"text":"My first time there was about 6 months ago. Service was slow and the food was so so. After a 6 month wait, my girlfriend and I decided to give it another go.   We get to the bar at 8:20 on a Thursday. It's about 30% full. It takes 10 minutes to get a drink and another 10 to put an order in, a burger and a grilled cheese. Slow, but still, it's only 8:40. It took a while considering our waiter had like 3 tables, but whatever.   Then we waited and waited and waited. After about 40 minutes we were told the kitchen was moving slow, but again, the place was practically empty so this didn't make sense. My gf never got offered the chance to order a 2nd drink  this whole time. By 9:35, when our food still hadn't come, we had to leave. I felt worse for the table behind us because they had 2 kids, ordered before us, and also didn't have their food. I can't recommend a place that I had to leave because the food never came."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out this new Madison brewing company, but to my dismay I was utterly disappointed. The online menu of beers looked really interesting, but when I got there they only had two of their own brews (an IPA and a porter) and the rest were \"guest taps\". The beer was okay, nothing special, but the biggest disappointment was the food. They have duck as a star protein on their menu, but they did not give its money's worth on the duck nachos. The nachos were 8 large chips (maybe the size of 16 regular chips) and had some mystery cheese sauce that tasted like alfredo, a few tomatoes, onions, and an under proportioned serving of duck. Took 30 mins for the nachos when it wasn't even busy on a Wednesday night (costs $11.50). I think they were over priced for the portions and quality of food. Unfortunately, not impressed and don't think I'll be spending money here again. :("}
{"text":"Came to Rockhound for the second time for Tuesday night Trivia (best in town), but this was the first time I got food. Not disappointed! Ordered the Mushroom and Swiss burger \"medium,\" and it was legit medium (a \"rare\" occurrence for most Madison joints, who overcook their burgers). The rosemary mayo on it was a revelation; why have I not made that before? I got a side of cheese curds, to see if they could compete with the best in town (on the square...you know who you are). And, surprisingly, they do. They're pretty close to--and if you're from Wisconsin, you know this--the kind you get at a state or county fair. Beer is good too. If there was any critique, it was that our bartender seemed to ignore cleaning the beer glasses immediately before pouring our pints (you know, with those spouts under the taps). I don't mind paying $4 for a good beer, but be consistent in the delivery. Overall: Highly Recommend, esp. Tues night Trivia Night!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and can't offer much of a review since no one acknowledged our presence after seating ourselves (like they required) much less welcome us, give us menus, or take our order. Watched people who came in after us, get menus and have orders taken while the waitstaff didn't even make eye contact with us... left after about 20 minutes of waiting... couldn't be more disappointed. Will not be back-"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Best mac and cheese burger hands down. 3 of their four beers were great. Service was good. Cheesecurds however were the worst part. Terrible breading.not enough to take off a star though. Loved it"}
{"text":"This place has recently opened and it will only get better. They currently have 3 house brews on tap and there will be more to come when the brewing starts up. I am excited to try some more specialty beers. Currently Rockhound has an IPA, porter, and ale. The IPA is not overwhelmingly hoppy so it is perfect for me. Very unique taste. The porter also has an excellent dark flavor with notes of chocolate and coffee but not overwhelming like I just poured coffee in my beer. The ale is a beer I could drink over and over and has significant flavor compared to many other ales.   The food is exceptional and far exceeds many brewpub food in the area. The selection of duck is amazing and the dishes are even better. I suggest the pulled duck or the growup grilled cheese (best menu items and also so much flavor I did not know existed with grilled cheese).   Since I work close to this business, I try to come here at least once a week. I have not had trouble with seating.  Great place to get some work done too!"}
{"text":"Long wait on their opening weekend but lots of great details/decor to take in while doing so.  Our server, Erin, walked us thru the menu, her recommendation of one of the house brews (Greenbush Pale Ale) was a great suggestion to follow... smooth, flavorful, mildly hoppy, and handled our large party well. They were out of quite a few dinner items but the Duck Nachos soothed us!  Saffron burger could have used more of the sauce as it didn't stand out.   We'll definitely be back again and are excited to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"We stopped in tonight and really enjoyed their beer.  The Mosquito  Bite  was very nice and their guest beer, a porter from Cedarburg, was very good as well.    For food we had the duck nachos and the veggie pot pie. I'd say the nachos were great, the pot pie was okay, I'm not sure we'd get it again, and that is the reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars.  The service was great- just the right amount of attentiveness without being over the top.  We will be back."}
{"text":"A review of the restaurant- not the beer.  We in Madison are fortunate to have a wide variety of quality eateries, so if you open a restaurant here you'd better have your act together.  Rockhound has been open for 10 months but on a recent visit it seemed to be shaking off the cobwebs as if they'd just opened. I get the sense these are newbies. In any case, this place doesn't deserve a long run.   After they finally added a kids menu, we gave it a try early on a Friday night. It was full but we got a table right away. If you care about such things the decor is new but bland.  To cut to the chase: The food is just okay and too expensive for the quality, and service was uneven and filled with mistakes. The menu is full of trendy things like 'grown-up grilled cheese'.  I tried three different beers which were all fine- this review is about the restaurant side of things. The poutine fries were okay (there's that word again). The kids' menu items were too expensive for what was served, not too mention they screwed up one of the orders. My elementary school-aged kids eat out all the time and gave the food a grade of 'meh'.  They are not picky eaters.  In many cities you would put up with the flaws here, but in Madison we don't have to."}
{"text":"Went to have lunch last Saturday. We ordered our food and drinks. Shortly after ordering we got a call that we needed to get back to the hospital. The staff was outstanding we offered to pay for sodas and they told us to get going. Look forward to getting back."}
{"text":"Overall, fine. I like checking out local breweries and am psyched when a new one opens so I was pleased to check it out. Out of the 4 house beers we had 3. I liked the hefeweizen ok enough. It's inferior to new glarus' dancing man but a good effort. We had the Mac and cheese burger and grilled cheese. Both were fine. Everything is reasonably priced. However the problem was the service. We were left waiting a long time for our drinks and then basics like napkins. Oddly enough she just left and someone else took over. I understand that shifts end but I would expect some communication that she was leaving. Instead while I was waiting for my check I watched her have social hour with some of the other servers, get her purse and leave. I won't actively seek out going again but I wouldn't avoid it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since it's in a great location, but I didn't fall in love with it. The décor/ambiance seemed manufactured and lacked the genuine character I was hoping to find (it's like the Food Fight version of a brewery). The food tastes okay overall, but the portions are fairly small for the price. The Greenbush pale ale had a strong diacetyl (buttery) flavor, which kind of ruined it for me. The porter and the their guest taps were fine, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I would NOT recommend this restaurant if you have food allergies!  First off, they couldn't tell us the ingredients of their pasta, pizza, or bread.  Then the chef was rude to us about food allergies.  When we told them that we didn't mind warnings like \"this product was produced in a facility that uses egg\", he told us that \"if your son has an egg allergy then you SHOULD care\".  Thanks, but I'm pretty sure we were there for dinner, not for unsolicited medical advice.  When we told him we would be leaving, he made no attempt to apologize and he didn't even try recommending alternative dishes.  He did clarify that we should pay for the drinks we had just been served, even though we wouldn't be staying to drink them."}
{"text":"We've passed by Rockhound many times and finally decided to finally stop in. The restaurant/bar was a bit smaller than what I expected from the outside, but it makes sense since the rest of the space is used for brewing. They aren't actually brewing in that space yet and instead are relying on another local brewery to collaborate until everything is up and running. Atmosphere is nice and well decorated. Feels like a good neighborhood joint and we'll be glad to return some time.  We got there at a good time and missed the dinner rush, so plenty of seating was available. We had some of their collaboration brews (I forgot which) and they were good from what I can remember. The duck nachos are awesome. A bit pricey for the number of nachos you get, but very delicious and my favorite part of dinner. Wifey had the stuffed bell pepper and I had the Bluestone burger. Other people seemed to rave about the pepper, and while it was good and tasty, it didn't knock my socks off. It's a good vegetarian option but felt s bit hyped (I'll blame my friends for raving so much about the dish). Burger was good and tasty, interesting flavor. The jam was a really good touch.  Service was good and friendly. She recommended the duck nachos and I appreciated that because they were as good as she described."}
{"text":"Drinks: Upland tangerine, Greenbush Pale Ale (APA), a Stout, Batch #3, and some Irish Car Bomb shots.  Food: Chicken Caprese bites ($10), 2x cheese curds ($9), walleye sandwich ($12), chicken sandwich ($10) and beet salad ($9.5).  They were out of Mosquito Bite, which is they only IPA they had on tap. One party in our group is an IPA loyalist and was devastated they didn't have anything to his liking. Our favorite was the Stout, a nice chocolaty and coffee aroma, it had a smooth and creamy pour. The rest of the beers were not full-bodied and honestly the taste was reminiscent of table beer.  The food on the other hand were more promising. The chicken Caprese bites were balls of tender chicken encased by crispy, dark brown panko-like coating, dressed in succulent marinara sauce adorned with Parmesan shavings. Oddly, it arrived on a bed of greens which were presumably wilted.   Each Carr Valley cheese curds were delicately coated and fried, the coating was not heavy but enough to keep the cheese from oozing after being fried. It came with a paprika ranch and horseradish sauce, we much preferred the former.  The beet salad was beautifully presented with both red and golden beets and contained roasted Brussels sprouts which was a delightful surprise.   Chicken sandwich came on a hummus spread and toasted ciabatta, both sandwiches were served with choice of greens or fries and a pickle spear. The walleye was thin and lengthy, the ends suffered from being in the pan a little too long but otherwise was well seasoned.  We ended up with a bill of ~$120 before tip and taking off some coupons we got in the mail.   I rate this as A-Ok because I can't really see coming here on a regular basis or as a meeting place to gather with friends because of the price point as well as the subpar beer."}
{"text":"I waited to write this review until I had gone to this place a couple times. I love it. Here's why:  The beer. Okay, I'm not a huge beer drinker. My husband is (loves their mosquito bite IPA, and everything else he's tried), but when I admitted that I wasn't a huge beer drinker and that I still wanted to try something, the super friendly staff brought me a couple samples. They weren't judge-y, mentioned they had plenty of other drinks if I didn't like any of those, but I did find something I liked. I've gone to many a brew-pub where they wouldn't have been nearly so friendly or helpful. My husband should really write a review on the beer alone- he would wax poetic about how they're making some of the best beer in town.  Along those lines, since I'm not a huge IPA fan (I know, I know, it's all the rage right now), I really appreciated the range of beers they have- I can't really imagine someone not finding something they like here (yeah, I've seen a couple of those reviews... but did they read the beer menu?), especially if they avail themselves of the staff's friendly expertise.   The food. I've tried a few things, from cheese curds to salad to burger to brunch. Everything was great. The burger came out exactly to order (yay for not just well done as an option!), and while I wouldn't normally be one to get a salad at a brew pub I was craving veggies and it was *delicious.* And brunch... so yummy. I'm snobby about my eggs benedict and their's was really, really good. My son got their apple pancakes and we all decided they were some of the best ever.   A few other things to add: We took my not-so-easily-pleased in-laws there and they liked it so well they went back without us. Huge compliment. They're not drinkers at all so their business is all about how good the food is and how friendly the staff is.   It's a great kid place. They're friendly to kids and have a kid menu that doesn't just involve kraft mac and cheese and dino nuggets- in and of itself that get's 5 stars in my book.   All in all this is a gem in Madison- can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The first time I had ever heard of Rockhound Brewing Company was months before its release when founder and owner Nate Warnke gave a passionate presentation on starting up a small business to a cozy and interested crowd at the American Family Dream Bank one cold winter night. I had been meaning to try the place out and last night I finally took that opportunity to check it out.   The space is large inside but if you do not know exactly where it is at you would easily drive right past. The interior is spacious and sparsely decorated. We were seated immediately and I ordered the Greenbrush Pale Ale and for a non beer drinker like myself I can certainly say it was mildly hoppy, refreshing and delicious. I had two pints! We started by ordering the Rockhound Cheese Curds which were House-brewed beer-marinated Carr Valley cheese curds, smoked paprika ranch, horseradish sauce. They came out warm and slightly crispy as they should and they rivaled those of the Old Fashioned. For the main course I had the Confit duck, gorgonzola garlic puree, arugula, sliced apples, gorgonzola cheese, toasted french roll  . I wanted to try something different than a burger and I have never eaten duck so I was a bit concerned that I would not enjoy it but wanting to be a tad adventurous I ordered it and was happy that  I did. The duck was not too gamey to throw my taste buds off and the garlic puree and apple slices offered a nice balance of sweet and savory as well as did the arugula.   The place was fairly empty as we were there around 7:30pm on a sunday night but I heard it can get pretty packed. The server was friendly and efficient and it was nice that the owner came out personally to greet us and thank us for stopping by. My only hope, and I hear it is in the works, is that as this place develops itself that they offer a more seasonal menu as right now aside from a couple nice surprises like my Duck Confit sandwhich, the rest is mostly standard pub fare. I would definitely recommend this place and I will definitely be checking it out again."}
{"text":"Well, well, well. We meet again, Rockhound. The first visit was terrible, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. They were busy. The place was new. They were still figuring it all out.  A year later, I'm back. It's 1 p.m. Nothing has changed. Slow service to start, but we finally get some drinks ordered. Then it's time for some food-how about the duck nachos? Nope. Their signature beer cheese sauce is...out? No problem. Except that also rules out another popular option: the Mac and Cheese.  I guess we'll just order something else, not the end of the world. We'll get the steak and potatoes, a comfort food staple. HOLD THE PHONE. They're out of potatoes. How in the world do you run out of potatoes?  We left hungry and disappointed. Other than that, it was great."}
{"text":"I came in around 4:45 p.m. on a Friday. I was hoping to grab some appetizers with two friends. I was told the wait would be an hour and a half. It's new, no sweat. We'll grab a drink at the bar and head somewhere else for dinner. The bartenders were busy, but also very inattentive. I waited...and waited...everyone around me was served. New people were served. I was trying to buy a round! Finally the gentlemen in front of me could sense my frustration, so they asked the bartender, will you please help her? The beers were good. The service was bad. It needs some work before I'll go back there."}
{"text":"I love a good dark beer and Rockhound has a few that they brew, YAY! My husband and I each ordered a large flight. We we able to choose 6 beers a piece. For food we tried the duck nachos, a burger and a salad. It was hard to choose just three items because there were so many items on the menu that interested me. All of the food was tasty and I can't wait to come back and try more. The only downside is the parking...not great as you can imagine with it's location on Park Street but we were able to find street parking a block and a half away. Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"I really do not like giving bad reviews, but there are so many good restaurants in Madison, that while I'm visiting I hate to waste a meal (especially bunch) on something disappointing. Perhaps they are more of just a brewery or dinner place, but I wasn't impressed by anyone's meal. I got the Monte Cristo (which I've had many times elsewhere and loved.) The French toast part of the sandwich was flavorless and the cheese sauce was all wrong - it didn't go together well at all. My friend got an egg sandwich which just came on plain bread - nothing special at all. Real bummer."}
{"text":"This brew pub is in a great new-old area. I love when new businesses come to this side of town. I've been here a couple of times, enjoy the energy here. The crowd is a little mixed with nearby employees, but mostly young people. Staff have been decent.  The beer here doesn't agree with me. And although they are in the Mad City Cocktail Book, that doesn't make up for the lack of clean, clear beers. If I'm remembering correctly, lots of IPAs, stout, and perhaps cream or farmhouse ale. I've had luck with sour options, at least one type I hadn't had before. Beer cocktails unfortunately made with the lowest quality alcohol (i.e. Gordon's or Fleishman's), their beer, and other less offensive ingredients; these cocktails are also much more expensive than the beer, Hm. I see they have trivia now too, reason to come back with something in mind! Yet to try the food too."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become one of our fave spots on West Washington, so I figured it was time for a review. They brew their own beer, which is really good, and the food is prepared with local ingredients into appetizers and entrees that compliment the beer very well.   This time I ordered a beet salad with chicken added for a small fee. The salad was delicious - a nice plate of greens topped with walnuts, veggies and an herbed vinaigrette that I asked for on the side. The chick was just ok. It tasted a little over cooked. I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries which were some of the best I've ever had. Honestly, every time I go back to Rockhound, I will order these fries. They come with a side of paprika ranch that is really good, too. My partner ordered the bleustone burger, which is topped with a garlic purée and caramelized onions. It's the second time he's ordered this burger.  It appears they have a great happy hour, so we will likely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Overpriced & underwhelmed.  Yep, upscale pricing.  Food is well presented. But not a fan. Curds were crisp shells with gobs of cheese stuck to the side. My medium rare burger was all gray inside but the texture felt rawish and the seasoning wasn't to my liking. Fries were pretty decent.  Kids hated the chicken strips, veiny. Mac & cheese was average, more buttery than cheesy but alright.  2 others in our party were underwhelmed.  Service was good and server was interesting. Beer was decent although everything they brew right now is on the upper side for IBUs.  Beer list (theirs & guest taps) was pretty snobby.  No TVs meant for some good conversations but dull if your soloing."}
{"text":"Like others, I had high hopes for this place. There wasn't too much that went right with our visit so I'll just give the bullet points.The printed menus were stained and disgusting.The place wasn't busy but we had an overly long wait before our server arrived.It's a brewpub, get me a beer at least and I'm happy! One of the beers from the menu was scratched. Almost all of the beers on their website \"Commonly on Tap\" list were either not available or had NEVER been available. Ordered a flight of 3 beers to sample, 4 beers came out (?) They have these neat serving boards that line the beers up in order 1,2,3,4 to match a list of what you wanted. My beers we placed in reverse order to the list and with one extra. So in all the confusion I'm not sure what I had. All the food came out at the same time, starters and entrees,(what the?) The menu sounds really interesting but the final product was less so. The decor, well they could use some decor, bare bones interior.I hope they get it together."}
{"text":"Really nice place! It opened at 11 am. I showed up at 10:25 am. I had no clue what time they opened. The bartender (Ken, I believe) said \"we'll open early just for you\" (LOL). I sat at the bar. He recommended a good meal. I had the Grill Cheese w/ chicken and bacon. Also, got a side order of sweet potato fries. Everything was delicious. The aioli with the sweet potato fries was definitely the best I ever had. I just moved here from Philadelphia. Chatted with the bartender. He saw I was flying solo so, he made it a point to come over and chat with me quite a few times. Ken was cool so, decided to have a few drinks ... why not? Definitely had an awesome time! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food but probably too organic/vegan/politically correct for me.  Nothing truly special about it as a brew pub either.  And looking around at the other patrons, I'm clearly not hip enough for this place.  I don't wear skinny jeans or have a long beard or wear a cutesy little hipster white boy hat.  But again, the food and service was decent."}
{"text":"I usually love brew pubs - good craft beer and bar-type food usually suits me pretty good.....but....this place was a sub-par experience for my first time being there.  I ordered a bleu cheese/onion burger (maybe named Bluestone?) and sweet potato fries - a decent and tasty meal - what you'd expect for a burger and fries.   I can't remember what my boyfriend ordered for his sandwich, but he ordered a side of cheese curds. I've NEVER seen a side of cheese curds SO SMALL. It was embarrassing - and the cost for the paltry amount of cheese curds was waaay too high. When we asked the waiter about the amount of cheese curds, he looked embarrassed - went back to the kitchen, and brought out a similarly small serving of cheese curds! Yikes. Not impressed.  We had a waitress that never really offered to get us another beer or water - that was frustrating too. The beer was pretty tasty.  Update: happy to report the owner reached out immediately, and i will be giving this place another try!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Was busy when I was there, had to wait for some seats, but Elise & Emily on staff took care of us. Beer is good, looking forward to the on-site brewing (they have some of their recipes for beer on tap but they're contract brews, haven't put their on-site stuff on tap yet due to licensing). Great food, salmon was excellent. Great all around."}
{"text":"I am torn as I write this review because there were things I loved about this place, but quite a few things that ruined the experience for me.  First, I have to say that the two beers they had on tap that they made themselves were absolutely delicious. I had both the Greenbush pale ale and the Grinder porter and I loved them both.   The food on the other hand was not good. The cheese curds seemed to be a popular choice so we decided to try them. A previous reviewer compared them to The Old Fashioned's, but the fact that they are both breaded fried cheese is where the similarities between the two end. The curds had a cornmeal breading, which was different and made them more crunchy, and they completely lacked flavor. The ranch sauce that is provided to dip them in was good and helped cover the bland flavor, but a good cheese curd will stand well on its own. I ordered the macaroni and cheese with mushrooms and my husband ordered it with mushrooms and duck. The macaroni would have been great, if it wasn't covered in burnt breadcrumbs. My husband and I both agreed that all we could taste was burnt toast unfortunately. The noodles on the bottom of the plate that didn't touch the breadcrumbs were really good, so it's unfortunate the rest of the plate was ruined with charred bread. Our friend ordered the pulled duck sandwich and ended up not being able to eat a quarter of it because he had to spit out the grizzle and fat that he couldn't chew.   I also did feel really bad for the host, who was working by himself and seemed completely swamped with the rush of people that came in. Even though it took over an hour he worked his butt off to get us our seat and was very polite and apologetic about the long wait. We might be back when things calm down, but probably just for the beer."}
{"text":"We visited the Rockhound brew pub on a very busy Saturday and I have to say I was really disappointed. First off we were totally ignored by our waitress who assumed we were someone else's responsibility. When we did order our apps came out swiftly and were pretty good. The cheese curds were really good. But once again we had to wait and wait for entrees and I received cold fries and an ice cold bun on my burger and some kind of tomato jam all over that did not compliment the meal.  I know they are shaking the bugs out of a new establishment but they need to get it together!"}
{"text":"So, joined the Mug Club after sampling every beer. Some of the best in Madison. Great value, even if your visits are infrequent.  Food is delicious. Not a diverse menu, but it's a brew pub. Poutine is amazing (hell yeah to the duck gravy!) But get the cheese curds too and just dump em on top. Beef pot pie is loaded with meat. Last special was a rib eye. Awesome. One of the best mushroom Swiss burgers around (most places mess up the mushrooms, IMHO - they didn't).  I'm a hop head, their IPA (Mosquito Bite) is on par with some of my favorites. Oh, and if it's on tap, you gotta try the Thunder Lizard! An oak-aged Belgian Quadruple. Wow!  Way to go Nate!"}
{"text":"The best summation I can muster is: unmemorable.  Unfortunately, Rockhound doesn't stand apart from the row of bars & brew pubs on nearby Regent St. beyond price point and older customer demographics.  Service from hostess experience to server was inattentive and at times confused about descriptions & dish components. Beer was fine. While a great presentation, the pot pie was bland and glue like. The Friday fish way was excellent (light, flavorful batter) but nothing else was standout enough to warrant a return visit."}
{"text":"Seat yourself, so we tried to find a table/booth, but they were all waiting to get cleaned up, so we sat at the one that was least dirty. A waitress came over fairly quickly to wipe it clean and remove the dishes, but left it quite wet. Had to wait a bit for her to come back so we could ask her to dry it. No napkins there to dry it ourselves, whatever, it happens everywhere, but this is not a cafeteria type of restaurant, so if you have patron seat themselves at least have someone busing tables.  Sampled some beers to start and ordered cheese curds. Beer was good, curds were overcooked and the cheese oozed out of many of them. Three of us, we ordered the blue cheese burger, the reuben, and the chicken pot pie. Ordered sweet potato fries with the sandwiches. Reuben was really good! Blue cheese burger was decent. Chicken pot pie was very bland. Normally don't add salt to foods, but this one desperately needed salt and pepper to give it a little taste back. Topped with a super thick pastry crust, which was so thick it was tough to get to the filling below. Wouldn't order that again. Sweet potato fries were ok. The staff seemed a little tired. Not rude or anything, but not overly warm and excited about the place either. Food arrived timely, as did beers, left a very nice tip. Like all new places, need to come back and give it another shot. Glad it's here and on Park Street. Found parking in the back. Just can't give it a great review yet, but still, not bad."}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious!  Mac n cheese burger, chicken pot pie, Rosa pasta, and cheese curds.  Mosquito Beer was delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Went here with a coworker for lunch. The beer was pretty good--I liked mine and my coworker seemed happy with his. But my meal left a lot to be desired. I got the sweet corn alfredo with chicken. The alfredo sauce was nothing special, and the chicken (which was sitting on top of the pasta instead of mixed in to everything) had a strange flavor and texture--it just didn't taste like it was cooked fresh. My coworker seemed satisfied with his sandwich, though. Good atmosphere and vibe, good beer, but the food was disappointing."}
{"text":"Good beers overall with a nice selection of other guest taps.  The beers we sampled (all on tap at the time) were all well made.  Not much in the way of new or interesting but solidly brewed.  We ordered some of the poutine and that was very good, but the portion size was a little small for the price.  The other food on the menu looked good as well, but we didn't eat here for supper.  Only beer & appetizers.  I'll definitely stop by again the next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good atmosphere. Several beers brewed here. Generally good all around. Still no really bang feature."}
{"text":"Had a $10 off coupon, so decided to try this place.  Not really into beer, but wanted to check it out anyway.  The star of the show was the Bee sting Cocktail- tart and delicious, but overpriced.  My friend and I each had a mushroom and swiss burger, both burgers hit the spot, but nothing special.  Also, they put a pickle on the plate with the burger that was neon-green and clearly came from a jar- what's the point?  Wait staff gave off a distracted, rushed vibe.  Would be willing to give this place one more try because the interior is beautiful, and the atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"It's not quite a brewery yet but the place has a lot of potential. The bar staff was very friendly. We didn't have any food but it looks about what you'd expect. At the time we went they had only been open a few months and I hope to visit it again."}
{"text":"Came back recently and this place has gone downhill with food and service. Items I liked are no longer on the menu. Wouldn't recommend any longer."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing beers!  Great service, owner as nice as can be!  We stopped by after taking our son to the zoo, kids menu with great options.  We will be back next time we're in Madison."}
{"text":"Mediocre Food (2 Stars)  Good Beer (3 Stars)  Okay Trivia (3 Stars)  Poor Service (1 Star) We left our stools and walked to the wait staff with requests more often than the wait staff stopped by our table. Typically, it seemed like we waited 4 or 5 minutes before getting up to go over and make our request.   Rather Upsetting Personal Experience when ordering and paying:  \"Can I get an order of sweet potato fries?\"  \"Sure Thing!\" (- Or something like this -) \"and could I add like, 2 grilled chicken breasts for maybe 5 or 6 bucks?\" \"No Problem\" When the food arrived, the chicken breasts were small. I assumed that our waitress might downcharge me to $3 or $4? When the bill came, however, I actually had a $10 charge for \"Open Food\" so I spoke to our waitress, \"I believe my bill wasconfused with somebody else's. I have this $10 charge?\" \"Yes, for the chicken.\" \"Oh. Can I get it reduced?\" \"Why?\" (With a totally still smile on her face.) \"...Nevermind. No big deal. I'll pay it.\"  It made a dent in my night.   Might give Rockhound 2 stars based on what would have been a \"typical\" experience. My personal experience was a 1-star however. I won't be back. There are too many other places."}
{"text":"ok. parking is a hassel in this cold weather.    No healthy selections.  Hummus came with fried garnish.      Really good for bar food basically but please add a few healthy non friend options,"}
{"text":"If you order the Moscow Mule, make sure you watch them pour the drink. I watched three separate drinks being made (which the menu states Titos) but they substitute Fleishmanns. That's like asking for a craft beer and getting a Schlitz. Server was great, bartender was not. Beer was solid."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite to eat on the holiday weekend with friends with kids. Although we didn't sample the beer, we did have adult beverages and all were tasty.  Food wise we had the pretzel sticks and poutine as an appetizer. Very tasty and the mustard is completely on point.  I split the Rueben and was glad I did because it is a generous portion. The table also had the beet salad, hummus plate, chicken flatbreads and the kids chicken fingers. No one was disappointed in their selection. Next time I am in town I will be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice.  Not too loud, not bright, not hokey, or overly hipstery.  As for the food.... 1) Poutine- fries, duck gravy, mozzarella + duck = 9.5 + 5 ( for the duck).  I wanted to love this.  I wanted it to me the sensual combination of the Great Dane's Poutine and Pig in a Fur Coat's duck fat fries, and while it was good it wasn't quite as good as either of the forementioned.  The portions weren't huge and the duck was a little dry and a little scant for the $5 up charge, but fries were quite nice.  It was tasty, but not the best in town on either point.  Next time I'll likely get the fries alone for $3 and save my 11.50.  2) Mushroom Swiss Burger - 1/3lb beef, sautéed mushroom, swiss, beer mustard, rosemary aoli + sweet potato fries w. Paprika ranch = 10.5 + 2 for the fries.   The burger was a little less flavorful and a little more cooked than I'd prefer, but overall it was tasty, especially once I added some horseradish (which was quite good).  The sweet potato fries were excellent.  3) Beer - the real reason to come is the beer menu.  Which isn't bad and comes in 3 size options.  The flight discount leaves something to be desired, but isn't bad either offering .25 off the smallest $2 size when you purchase a selection of 4 or 6 .    Verdict: Not as good as the old fashioned for a meal, but much more convenient.   I won't be dreaming of this place, but I'll likely also be back.... at least for a beer and some fries (sweet or non)."}
{"text":"I really enjoy my evenings at Rockhound. Their beers are great and the service is solid. Of all of the Friday fish fry's I've tried so far in my two years in Madison I rate theirs near the top. Atmosphere is casual and friendly. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The first time I was here was just for beer. I was happy and after looking over the menu, I knew I wanted to come back for dinner.  It did not disappoint. I ordered the Reuben (of which I consider myself a harsh critic) and it was better than most. It came with a Russian dressing, which I asked for them to remove but they did not. Luckily it must be homemade because it was not as thick as most and the sandwich was still good enough that I did not complain or send it back.   The hubs ordered the French dip which was In.Freaking.Credible. This was probably the best of such sandwich I have ever had. Even though there are many other things on the menu I want to try, I would be hard pressed to pass on this in the future.  I'm a bit of a fry snob and I would say they were solid. Also got the curds as a side instead of fries. For me, the amount that comes on the side was enough, but I will agree that an additional $3.50 charge is a bit outrageous and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. Yes they seem to be in a cornbread type of coating, but I found it light, different and quite satisfactory."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow and not the friendliest but the food is top notch. Also love the choice of taps and that each are available in 3 different sizes & price points. The smallest is the perfect sample size. Hubby got the founders raspberry which i thought id hate but turned out to be delicious. Also tried rockhounds scotch ale, another winner. I got the quinoa & apple salad which you can add chicken or apple to so i got salmon. The maple vinaigrette had just a hint of maple syrup and a nice balance of vinegar, not too sweet but not too tart; just right. My husband got the salmon blt and upgraded to sweet potato fries which were out of this world. Amazing blend of smoky, salty, bbq spice but not overpowering. And the paprika aioli was a great match. These are in the running for best sweet potato fries ever. Andy said the salmon was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of seasoning. He thought the bread was a little much, like the slices were too big for the filling, but overall it was a delicious blt with above-average bacon. We'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!!!  Came here for a busy happy hour just after they opened. The Porter was wonderful! Duck nachos and chicken parmesean balls were incredible! Servers were great, couldn't answer all questions (but they are still new so I get it), and they were all super friendly. Great food, service, and it's a gorgeous setup inside."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and thought it was time for a review, plus and minus style:  + nice beer selection. I've tried a few and really enjoyed. However, I'm not much of a beer drinker due to a gluten sensitivity. My husband is a beer snob and really enjoys the beer here. I like that you can get 3 pour levels, so you can enjoy a small amount of a few different ones. + food is quite good. Today I had the tomato croquettes and they were delicious! I also had the spinach and chickpea salad. The avocado dressing was spot on and not drowning the other ingredients. It was also much larger than I expected, so my hubs and I didn't need to share those croquettes first. As it turned out, I had some salad to take home. + great music and ambiance. They did a nice job decorating the space. It's open and bright, which I will appreciate during winter visits.  Only a couple suggestions below, which are just personal preferences: - appetizer was not served with small plates, so the hubs and I ate it off the same plate. It's fine for us to share cooties, but it's always a bit awkward to share a plate in the middle of the table. - I think an option to have grilled chicken or the pan fried walleye on top of the salads would be nice. As previously stated, the salad was larger than expected and included chickpeas, almonds and avocado dressing, so it was pretty filling on its own. - would love to see a gluten free guest tap or bottles from Alt Brew as well as a gluten free bun option.  Overall, a GREAT addition to the Park Street and Monona Bay area."}
{"text":"I came here for a Yelp get together and then joined my family for lunch here. The beer flights were good overall. As for the food, my husband and I split the trio of duos and, while the sun dried tomato jam and avocado spreads were tasty, there really was not very much food there to defend spending $9. We weren't that hungry, but it isn't something I'd choose again. My sister had their signature burger, which she thought was pretty good, and my brother thought his chicken pot pie was just okay. I did enjoy the ambiance, though - standard modern pub vibes."}
{"text":"Our first time here, and we were pleasantly surprised. You must try the grilled cheese sandwich with chicken. It's something special and out of this world. The cheese curds were light and fluffy. The beers offered are great!"}
{"text":"I'm stuck between 2 and 3 stars for my review of Rockhound Brewing Company.  I just wasn't impressed and probably wouldn't go out of my way to return.  Despite there only being two other patrons at the bar, we waited for an acknowledgement from the bartender that we were there.  He didn't seem all that interested in taking our order and after we decided on a flight or their beers to share, getting his attention for a couple glasses of water proved a challenge.  My friend and I did luck out on our timing in another way, though.  We were able to sample 6 Rockhound original brews.  The Rockhound beers we tried (a brown ale, an amber ale, a blonde ale, an APA, a extra pale ale and a stout) all kind of felt middle of the road.  Nothing stood out as a favorite and we were able to finish them all without our taste buds feeling insulted.    Our bartender tried chatting us up a bit after we tried the beers to see what we liked.  But it felt like too little too late.  He made it weird.  Ultimately my experience here was 2 stars but if I did go back, I think an updated review might add at least another star.  On the plus side, the food did look and smell good (but we were only there for beers).  And if you aren't into their beers, their draft list includes an impressive list of beers from other local breweries.  So they have that going for them."}
{"text":"Super fun place for a quick bite and delicious drink! The vibe is cool and laid back with a more upscale pub style menu. The only complaint I have is that the service was pretty slow. Otherwise, I definitely recommend Rockhound!"}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, and relaxed atmosphere not much more you can ask for. Food came out fast and was good. Beer was good, on the lighter side for taste. Only has one TV which makes for a for a more intimate atmosphere. Wait staff was friendly and took great care of us."}
{"text":"That was a nice surprise. Stopped for the first time here for lunch with some friends. Typically, I do not hold out much hope for what appear to be pretty generic brewpubs for lunch. At least by today's measure and what I had for lunch, I give Rockhound a big thumbs up.  It was not too busy at the Noon hour.  I got a prompt, nice and warm hello and welcome from the bartender who looked up from his work to kindly greet me. That was nice.  Goes a long way with me.   I had their lunch special of the day - - a grilled tilapia sandwich with corn relish on a grilled ciabatta roll.  Fries or a tossed salad and a drink are included - - $10!  Our waiter was very kind and attentive. My lunch was excellent, particularly for the money. It was a large tilapia fillet grilled perfectly with a moderately spicy corn relish. The ciabatta roll wasalso grilled to perfection. Soft on the top and middle but crunchy on the inside.  High marks for their attention to this detail.   I went with the green salad option with their house balsamic dressing.  The salad was fresh and the dressing, tangy.  There are a variety of drink choices, including cold and hot tea. Having never done it before, I asked for hot tea. The server brought out a hot cup of water along with four types of teas for me to select from.  Very thoughtful and unexpected!  While none of us were imbibing at that hour, we were curious about their beer offering.  Perhaps a little shameless, but we  each asked for a sample of one of their seasonal beers.  With noticeable diplomatic aplomb, our waiter was happy to oblige.  (We had the Mobcraft cream ale which was very good).  Our waiter was very attentive and brought our bills and checks with perfect timing.   I have read mixed reviews about Rockhound,but I can say my one experience here was excellent. A strong Four Yelp stars.   I plan to visit again.  If not for the food and beer, for the kind service today and simply as a way to say \"thank you\" for a very pleasant and satisfying lunch with friends.    Rockhound, if you're reading this, well done and thanks!!!  I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast/brunch - I wish they did it more often and I wish they didn't open so late the ONE day of the week they offer breakfast. That said, I love the food here for both breakfast and lunch/dinner (although I've only done non-breakfast food twice). They have an impressive drink selection from beers to cocktails, and the tap list has never let me down (and I've been let down by many a tap list). For a small brewery, it is impressive what they have on tap. In addition to their own brews, which are among some of my favorites in Madison, they also usually have some guest taps as well.  Atmosphere is great, large bar, and staff has always been friendly. Parking can be a bit of a challenge if it is a busier day, but haven't traditionally had to search too long and hard. It is just far away enough from the State Street crowd that you generally get a more pleasant group of people in the place even when it is busy. Used to often be a quieter place to go where you could hear the person next to you talk without yelling, but as the neighborhood around it grows it definitely is getting more crowded on the weekend nights, which isn't a bad thing. Of all the crowded and loud places to go out on a weekend night near downtown, this tops my list."}
{"text":"I found Rockhound through their coupon in the Bucky Book this year and I am so thankful I did! Went with my best friend, seeking out good brews and a comfortable setting and Rockhound surely delivered. We ordered the cheese curds ( as one typical does in the cheesy heart of America ) and marveled at their horseradish dipping sauce. Much to our delight, our service was prompt and kind with suggestions about beer choice readily available. We ordered their Mac and Cheese and the Bleustone Burger- both were excellent and surpassed our lofty expectations! Highly recommend! And their music was downright jammin!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, sweet copper bar, good selection of beers from them, guest taps and bottles. Friendly attentive bartender, nice local crowd. Third time here, didn't eat the food yet. Prices are high but reasonable."}
{"text":"I have really tried to like this place seeing how I was born and lived on Drake St and love the neighborhood, but I've been here 5 times and it has sucked everytime.  Beer is not that good...service sucked, and last time I was there was their second anniversary which happened to be my birthday, April 5th. he offered me a free beer so I accepted. When bill came it was on bill. Wow, trick play? When ordering beers told him my wife likes only lagers, why no lagers on menu. Brewpub with no lagers or pilsners...wow, not everyone likes ipa's but that's their choice. I've heard many complaints about that and thus make for many one and done stops. None of my friends whom like great tasting ever go here. So our waiter tried pushing beers on my wife that I told him she doesn't like. I know my beers for I am a home brewer and craft beer lover. Then got food and was shocked at how small my cubana sandwich was. Menu states french roll which are like a mini sub bun everywhere else I have been but here mine was smaller than a burger and they cut it in half to look bigger. The price...$11.00...really??? Prices overall are high.  Give me a break. Fries in poutine and sweet potato fries so salty bearly could eat them but I had to cuz had no time to go eat somewhere else because wife was taking me to a movie. I heard they have had several different head cooks...not for sure with that though they sure as hell need a new one now. Well our night was half shot after stopping here and thus I give up...I tried. If I could rate zero, I would.  For great beer I stop 2 doors next to them, the Mason Lounge...great place!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. My pan-fried walleye was tasteless other than the pickled onion which didn't go well at all. And that was one of the worst side salad/vinaigrettes ever.  The beer was flat-out unimpressive for Madison standards (even the guest taps). And not a TV to be found.  Two stars because the location was off the beaten path a bit and place itself is otherwise kind of cool (in a condo complex called 'The Dude Abode'), which makes it even MORE disappointing."}
{"text":"I've known the owner/founder Nate for some time from working together previously, and when three of us decided to go for Sunday brunch, I suggested Rockhound. I know it's a brew pub, but none of us ordered beer - we were there for the food.  So when I saw the donut burger, I was immediately unsure AND intrigued. Curiosity won and glad it did. Imagine a raised donut, cut in half, with a burger between. Surprisingly tasty. Not easy to eat though (the glazed donut is sticky) so I was happy to quarter it with a knife and eat it slider style.   My friend got the biscuits and gravy and I asked to taste it. It's REALLY tasty.  The brunch menu is short, which frankly, I like. Not too much to choose from. I thought the prices were fair, service was good and it was my lucky Sunday, Nate walked in shortly before we departed. It was good to catch up.   Four stars because the parking isn't great. There IS a lot in the back, but it's not clear if restaurant patrons could park there or not (mentioned this to Nate and he told me the back lot IS ok to park in - but it needs better signage). Otherwise, it's street parking which can be scarce during busy times."}
{"text":"Good burger on a busy night. Heather the waitress was very acomidating. Beer selection is good but if you think bud light is beer, this is not the place for you.. try the Greenbush or the mesquite bite. Both are good."}
{"text":"The care put into this new brewpub really shows. The beers are not only excellent, but the space itself stands apart from other comparable places. We loved sitting at the copper bar. (That and the walls' warm hues make a large space seem much cozier than it would otherwise be.) They've cleverly placed coat hooks AND usb ports below the bar, which is practically a gift from God in my estimation.   Beyond that, the menu solidly covers a lot of bases. I recommend the chicken & chickpea dish above all, but the burgers are tasty, too. The cheese curds stand to be a major contender (even in a town with many apt competitors!). They're comparable to the Old Fashioned's curds, but with a more interesting seasoning and the benefit of not one but two sauces. Opening night brought a crowd, which meant some delays, but all told pretty impressive for the first evening out of the gate. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Ugh.... terrible food, slow service and over priced. So many better choices. The cheese curds were not good, the poutine seemed like it it was leftovers. Pass on this place."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch!  I found myself in the neighborhood and decided to treat myself.  I ordered the Salmon Risotto.  It was ready quickly and it was fantastic!  I had plenty by to take some home with me.   My server, Isaac, was very welcoming and attentive. I love this place and wish I lived nearer!"}
{"text":"We went to for lunch on probably the busiest Saturdays (Crazylegs).  I had the beer flight and there was not one beer that I didn't like.  We had the cheese curds which were delicious.  Several of us had pot pies.  Each of these was perfect.  Of course with any new establishment they are working out the minor details.  This is definitely a place that I will return to again and again!"}
{"text":"Great environment, modern bar, and all around nice atmosphere; not to mention the great brews at reasonable prices.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"stopped in for lunch today and a very pleasant surprise. Bartender was very friendly and cordial, kept mentioning he was off his game because he had earlier broken a 5 oz, beer glass. Ordered the chicken sandwich with fries and it was very good, only negative was they spread the cole slaw right on the sandwich, not my thing. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Boring.  Beer was fine, food was fine.  I'm kinda over the whole brewpub thing so maybe this is more of a \"it's me not you\" review but nothing about this place made me want to come back.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"Great beer & delicious food! A new place in Madison on Park street highly recommend. For a brand new brew pub the beer is already really tasty.  The menu is eclectic with perfect flavor fusion. I had the veggie pot pie & would order again tomorrow. Everyone had something different and would come back again. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Rockhound. Not my first time, I'm familiar with their beers and some of the food. I had the Bluestone Burger with the side salad. Lettuce begin with the lettuce. As expected, a nice mixed greens. Fresh and tasty if not a little lean in portion size. The burger was cooked to order, I asked for rare, got medium rare (not surprised, I order rare hoping for not more than medium rare so no big deal). The bacon was great, the beef was quite good, the garlic spread was nice and complimented well by the Gorgonzola. Quite happy. I'm not sure their choice of bun is sturdy enough, but the brioche was very good. The Rye IPA went well. My only real complaint is the pickle. For a $12.50 burger, you can afford to put a worthy fresh style pickle on the side (the light green with lots of crunch) instead of the pickle-for-people-who-don't-care-about-food kind of pickle. That needs to be fixed."}
{"text":"My first time trying Rockhound was through a takeout order. I called in for two mushroom swiss burgers and a french dip. They informed me that it would be ready in about 10 minutes. It was more like 15, but that's still really fast. They packaged everything really well for me, including a little dipping container of ketchup for fries. My only complaint is that the mushroom swiss burger was as stated: mushrooms and swiss on top of a burger patty. I know not all places do this, but I really expect my burgers to come with lettuce and tomato on the side. I was disappointed to discover the lack of lettuce and tomato with my burger in the box. The burger itself was tasty - thick patty, perfectly melted cheese, nicely sauteed mushrooms.  I came in again a day later for drinks with some friends, and I was really impressed with their cocktails. Though they should be a beer place, I really liked the Bee's Knees cocktail. The other cocktail we ordered (name escapes me) was also tasty just not quite as tasty as the Bee's Knees. But I would definitely come back and try more things off their cocktail menu."}
{"text":"LOVE this little gem! Amazing House Brews!! I lean toward the Grinder (coffee porter), Coal Seam (stout) or Ice Shanty (bock)...and am never disappointed. Fab craft beers with great finishes. This evening I ordered the Mediterranean Flatbread from the \"Snack\" offerings. At $9, it's flavorful and plentiful! A delightful Parmesan & garlic crust with perfectly wilted spinach, sprinkled with feta, heirloom tomatoes and pesto and drizzled with balsamic glaze...DELISH!! I'm complimenting this with the Ice Shanty. Heeeaven!! Tonight is a brief stop pre-yoga, HOWEVER!! Tuesday's are faaaaabulous because FREE TRIVIA begins at 7:30 and it's a guaranteed great time!! Expect a few serious teams of 6-8 though!!"}
{"text":"I went on for beers only the other night.  Experience was good but not great. The bartender was good and attentive.  The beer was interesting...sampled a few and settled on the Dour Scotch Ale which was great.   So based on service and the one beer I had I will go with a four but I need to try again as it felt more like a 3.5"}
{"text":"Had the salmon dinner. It was really good! I am happy to have a bar with American cuisine in the neighborhood. Next time I'm going to try their burgers"}
{"text":"Busy on a weeknight. The beer was at the middle of our experience in craft beer settings. The porter was the best of the lot.  The hummus plate was very good. The brisket was tasty but very small for the price with only specks of the promised veggies.   Attentive service and a nice setting."}
{"text":"Food might be good, we'll never know because we left without ever being acknowledged by any employee. First of all, \"seat yourself\" at a downtown restaurant is idiotic - whoever gets to the table first wins, regardless of who came in first. We found one last table with no chairs, and hoped to ask someone if we might grab two chairs from elsewhere, but stood there at this table for 10 minutes without so much as a hello.  So bye."}
{"text":"First time in, didn't quite know what to expect. Really cool space, you can tell a lot of thought was put into the design of the place.   Had 2 beers: The APA and the Mosquito Bite IPA. Both had really good balance, enough hops without being overpoweringly bitter.   Mushroom Swiss burger ordered medium rare and cooked to perfection. Sad to say not many places I have been to can actually pull that off. They add a rosemary aioli and stone ground mustard to the burger. I will be honest, I wasn't sure how the combo would work, but wow did it ever.   Certainly not the most expansive menu in the world, but it seems for what they do, they do it well. Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This place is promising, and I was happy to check it out within the first few weeks of their opening. I was disappointed to find out that they were out of their own signature beers upon my visit (Greenbush Pale Ale and Grinder Porter), and settled for other local craft beers on the menu. I do like that they offer three sizes (5 oz, 10 oz, 16 oz) in all beers which is a nice invitation to try out many beers on their menu!  The food was certainly the highlight of my first trip to Rockhound Brewing Co. I ordered the Grown Up Grilled Cheese and was enamored at first sight. Cheddar, gouda, and parmesan form a dream team, and yes there is cheese melted onto the outside of the sourdough as well as the hefty cheesy serving on the inside. The tomato jam is heavenly, and the spinach is a great touch as well. I don't remember how well I liked the fries which means they were likely good, I think I just blacked out from the bliss of my sandwich.   I Highly recommend checking this new place out, just be aware that they're currently experiencing heavy traffic and they may not be fully stocked up because of the demand. You've been warned!"}
{"text":"As Rockhound recently opened, I knew, coming in, that there may be some rough spots (as all new business go through). As a result, I am bumping it up a star as last night's meal was definitely worthy of only 2 stars. The restaurant was pretty slammed when we showed up Saturday night but we were able to grab a seat at the bar. As Rockhound can't yet brew onsite they offer two collaboration beers with House of Brews as well as about five other guest taps. I tried one of their collaborations-a pale ale. Hopefully, this isn't indicative of what they will brew as the beer was flat in taste and forgettable. On the food side, I originally wanted to order the duck confit sandwich but learned they were out. (Hard to understand as it was 6:30 on a Saturday). Instead, I went with their saffron mushroom burger with a order of cheese curds and my daughter opted for the chicken pot pie. All 3 missed the mark quite considerably as the execution of each was flawed and all lacked properly seasoning. I didn't get any sense of the saffron aoli that was advertised and the sautéed mushrooms and German Swiss lacked any punch. The best thing about it was the Madison Sourdough brioche. The curds, while nice and oozy, were battered, inexplicably, in corn meal so it left the curd grainy and gritty. If they change the batter, the curds have the potential to be very good. Finally, the pot pie. This was a fail. Served in a bowl topped with puff pastry (aka deconstructed), it was more of a cream of chicken soup than pot pie. It seriously lacked a thickener and the meat was rather tough. Overall, it was flavorless.  Execution is key when opening a new restaurant. While I am excited for another restaurant on the Park Street corridor, that won't be enough of a reason for me to want to come back. I'll wait for a few months and see others review before making my way back."}
{"text":"Four of us went on a Saturday night. Rather full and buzzing environment. I loved the bar area, lighting and decor. We were quoted 45-50 min wait time, but we were seated in about 20 min. At the time of this review they only had 3 beers of their own of which they collaborated with local breweries to create. The other taps available were local. The menu was short and sweet. We got the cheese curds and trio of duos for appetizers. Both were very good. For dinner we ordered the Pulled Duck, Rockhound Rueben, Veggie Flatbread, and Big Apple Salad. Again, all were very good. The service was great too. 4 stars for the technology mishap in the kitchen where they 'lost' 20 tickets which resulted in extensive wait times at the table before any of our food came; thank goodness for good company. Another reason for 4 stars is the inconvenience of having to find a place to park on the street in an already very overcrowded neighborhood. We got lucky I think, as we only parked about 30 yards away from the entrance. Overall, great experience and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a Saturday night.  Great atmosphere and nice build out.  Started with the porter which was excellent.  We had the tomato basil flatbread and cheese curds,  both were great , although smaller portions.  Our party had the chicken and grilled cheese,  both were great.  A great find off park street."}
{"text":"We checked this place out recently.  The atmosphere is great.  Food was just ok for the high price.  We ordered the cheese curds.  I'm pretty sure they were overlooked.  Horseradish sauce was great though.  I got a $14 burger that had the smallest meat patty.  The place is small and we waited for an hour to get a table, which was expected.  My friend ordered the Mac and cheese and wasn't impressed either.  We tried both of the beers they brewed.  Both were fine, but tasted watered down.  Breweries are always welcome, but I'll probably stick to Karben4."}
{"text":"So Babe and I went here last Sunday, it was fantastic. We tried the egg Sammy with fries, so tasty; the aioli was heavenly. Babe had a salmon BLT sans salmon which she loved. They have the classic French fry style that I love!  The staff was great!  We both tried 5 oz pours of the Hefeweizen, IPA, Coffee Porter, and stout. 5 oz pours are the best because of my small bunny paws. The Hefeweizen was my favorite, it ranks up there with the best. All the beers were very very good, I'm like they should bottle this! lol"}
{"text":"I'm used to pretentious dining in Madison, it's how hipsters continue their life-force, but this place just isn't for me.  Let me state that the micro-brew nation that seems to be growing every day is why this restaurant exists. If you had to compare it to bro food (like Great Dane) this locale had a duckfat poutine that made me question my decision making, not just here but in future events. It was disgusting, the beer tasted like burnt coffee that passed through a derelict submarine, and we were pretty well crammed into our seating.  I'll pass from now on, this place wasn't affordable and while the wait staff were nice the rest of the experience wasn't all that great. If you live for 1 location restaurants (or are anti-chain restaurant) then this might be a great place for you. Otherwise, steer clear."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally get to try the food at Rockhound. Their menu had always looked good to me. I love food and went to culinary school and love trying new places. Boy was I disappointed.  First I got a beet salad. This was delicious. Prefect amount of dressing. Great salad. The drinks were great two. The rest of the food was not.   The salmon and vegetable risotto. Salmon was fine but the risotto was not risotto. The rice was over cooked and it was just a mushy mess. If you can't properly make a risotto, don't put it on the menu. Risotto should spread across a plate, creamy and smooth. This was a pasty, mushy overcooked mess. The woman next to us ordered the same thing and she left most of her meal uneaten.   The braised short ribs was not a braised short ribs. The meat was not short rib. I'm confident in that. It was a cheap cut of meat you'd use in a pot roast. In fact, it tasted like pot roast. It came out swimming in liquid, like soup. Hint, chef you never see a meat dish swimming in liquid because its supposed to be a reduction of the cooking liquid. Again, if you cant cook something don't put it on the menu. It was gross and I cannot believe they'd lie on a menu and call that meat short ribs. I make short ribs at home, I order them out often and THAT was not a short rib. Such a disappointment. Literally the worst \"short ribs\" dish I have ever had.   The burgers looked Okay? Maybe that is a better bet for ordering. Don't wast your money on their entrees. They are not good."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp and it didn't disappoint. We tried almost every beer on tap and they had such unique flavor. Plus, the staff was excellent explaining everything to us in detail about the beer. The atmosphere was clean and very cool decorations ! We didn't eat here just drank but the menu also looked interesting. They have a special every day - trivia night etc.  Seems like a very cool spot hidden in Madison to hang at."}
{"text":"Always solid, quality food and beer.  The owners have put a lot of time and energy into this place and it shows.  The salads are gigantic (and great) and the curds have an awesome cornmeal beer batter unlike any other I've had.  Their beers play the subtleties angle rather than blasting your mouth, which I'm ready for now that the hops craze has gotten a little old.  Probably my favorite thing is the 5 oz pours you can get- a great way to enjoy a burly beer without a 12 oz commitment!I've been a regular since they opened, and will probably continue to be for years to come."}
{"text":"Great food, and a great location to watch some football. Not a huge fan of the beer they brew, but they did have some great other breweries on tap."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim. We were not disappointed. We had the flat bread chicken appetizer which was good. The beer was good we did a flight of 4 beers and enjoyed. The staff was great and informative. We will come back when in the area. Good beer, staff, and food."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!! Awesome food. We had the chicken sandwhich duckling sandwhich and the burger. All amazing!"}
{"text":"This is not a brewery.  At least that's not how the place presents itself. Its more of a bar/pubfood locale that happens to make some of its own beer. Think much more Vintage/Great Dane than Karben4/Ale Asylum. Most of the beers for sale were from outside brewers. The beers they make here, both the pale ale and porter, were decent-- on par with the Vintage. Both the cheese curds and the salad were pretty uninspired, as was the service. Overall, a fairly meh experience."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night and loved it! I don't drink beer very often but I was able to sample some of their beers in 5 oz glasses for just $2.00 each! I rarely order beer because I don't know what I like but with this nice addition to the menu, I was able to sample a few and loved them all (their Grinder - coffee stout is my new favorite). We also had dinner, really good food and great service! We will certainly be coming back here soon."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on their Brunch menu and service, which were both delightful. We ordered the Apple Jacks, Classic Benedict and Salmon BLT with greens. I have to say, the potatoes were my favorite part! A little greasier than I'd like, but TONS of flavor and perfectly cooked. You have NO idea how hard it has been to find a good place that makes GOOD breakfast potatoes that are seasoned perfectly. The salmon BLT was also devoured in no time, we really liked the greens and the light vinaigrette that went with it. We had really good service, and it wasn't too busy which is really nice! It's a new favorite brunch spot for us!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place out thanks to a Bucky Book coupon and I'm so glad we did. The service was great - got seated right away and our food came out quickly. They have a small menu but that just means what they do have is really good. We had an appetizer of pretzels with the yummiest spiciest mustard! I had a balsamic vinaigrette pasta and my husband had the chicken pot pie. We both were clean platers. I also had the most heavenly hot cider Jim Beam drink.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to the veggie pot pie I had when they opened and was told it wasn't a good seller unfortunately and was taken off of the menu.  I opted instead for the grilled cheese and the flavors and cheese were good, along with the grill on the bread.  Asked for greens as the side, nothing special there. My dining companion got the beef pot pie and it did not live up to the expectations.  The temperature was not hot enough and the overall flavor tasted like something that had been reheated too many times.  This is not a typical pot pie, but veggies and meat sauteed in a pan with some sauce added.  It's too bad they didn't add more flavor to the sauce.  The server was very nice and had no problem bringing a bbq chicken sandwich instead, which was really good. We also ordered the root vegetable \"fries\" with hummus, which should instead be called \"flash fried root veggie spears\" because the name on the menu is misleading.  They were very fibrous and not cooked all the way through.  We didn't finish them and would not order this again.  The hummus was actually really good though, would be better served with some root veggie chips perhaps. I also got the Grind coffee stout from their house brew.  The coffee used in the beer tasted like it had been burnt during the roasting process.  I love coffee beers and have never had one taste like that before.  Luckily, the server was again very nice to bring a replacement, no questions asked. We were only charged for what we finished, and the service was above average. Our first experience was so good, this was a disappointment.  Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I came here on a busy Friday night and waited a predictable 45 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated our server greeted us in a somewhat timely manner but it took quite awhile to get the beers we ordered. Beer was underwhelming as neither mine nor my boyfriend's had much flavor. As for the food- I ordered the cubano sandwich which was much smaller than expected and was also meh at best. However, the sweet potato fries that accompanied it were spectacular! All in all my experience was underwhelming. Food was unsatisfying, service was eh, and beer wasn't great. There are many other breweries in the area that I'd rather go to."}
{"text":"Rockhound is the closest non-chain brewery to my house and I was reallyl excited for them to open. I have been there plenty of time, as it is frequently my way home from work and an open parking spot on Park Street just calls my name on some days. The staff are all friendly and you can go for a pint, flight, or just one or two 5 oz. pours if you want.   The food is alright, but I have had some great soups and their fried cheese curd are better than most.   The Thunder Lizard, a Belgian Strong ale that is oak aged, is there best in my opinion and has a lot going on. They have a full bar and there is always a cider on tap, so there will be something for the non-beer drinkers."}
{"text":"Beer is great. However we had a small group of friends to visit with a friend who came from out of town (Alaska). We got a table to drink and eat at. The waitress asked us to move to the bar after about 20 minutes because we were not ordering food fast enough and moved us to the bar. She said they had people waiting to eat. After we moved to the bar we saw two tables stay untouched and open the entire time we stood at the bar again. Waitress told one of our friends that she had only served us a beer so far and wasn't interested in serving us. Not cool."}
{"text":"Overall, I'm not impressed. The staff seemed disinterested and bored. The food was okay, but nothing great. The brew (I ordered the house porter) was nothing to write home about. No body, with a metallic aftertaste. To tell you the truth, I didn't even finish it.  Perhaps they are trying to get the kinks out, or perhaps they are perfectly fine with bored staff and mediocrity.   Reading all of the other reviews, I stayed away from the duck on the menu and order a burger. Again, it was alright...but nothing signature or special.   I may or may not be back to give it another chance; time will tell. It's not easy running a brew pub and not everyone is cut out to do it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple of beers with my husband. Both were pretty good. They only had 4 which were their own but spoke with the bartender and he said there are definitely plans to expand. There were about 8 guest taps also. I like that they offer three different size glasses.   We did not eat there but any food that other people ordered looked pretty good. We'll be back to try some more of their brews."}
{"text":"Aside from great beer, Rockhound has delicious, fresh food, a friendly staff and great atmosphere. Prices are very reasonable. There are a lot of great places to eat and drink in Madison, but this is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My husband and I have been here a handful of times... wish it was closer, we'd be here  all the time.  LOVE their pot pies, and beet salad. This time I tried the new ratatouille flat bread and my hubby had the fish fry.  Both were fantastic!  Ratatouille flat bread was fresh and savory- perfect for Summer!  The fish fry had this peppery yummy batter and homemade tarter sauce.  Yum yum YUM!! It was surprisingly not busy on a Friday night at 7:00...don't know why.  We're surprised this isn't everyone's favorite place in Madison! The Madison market is pretty saturated with brew pubs, and this one is one you do NOT want to miss.  One of my faves for sure!   PS- sorry no pics, we scarfed down our food too fast!"}
{"text":"Come for the food and beer but you might stay for a while waiting for your check. It's new and a work in progress service wise but the kitchen produced a creative and well cooked burger. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't been here sooner! Great atmosphere and music! The food was really fantastic. I had a grown-up grilled cheese, my husband had a duck breast sandwich, and my sister had salmon with parsnip mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Incredibly creative and delicious menu. Their beer is also great and they have a lot of variety. I have nothing but great things to say about this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Way better places to grab a beer in town. Their beer is subpar, at best."}
{"text":"Biked over here on a beautiful day in February! Tried the newer flight because couldn't decide on a beer. Their limited time Glowing Embers is amazing and I also liked the Smashed Cherry for a fun fruity beer.  We tried the pretzels, very big, but a little too \"wheaty\". The cheese curds were light with a good sauce, just too small. Not a fan of tiny curds. Love the atmosphere- would recommend!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice and the waitress was excellent. I ordered the half rack of ribs that was the special of the day. It was just okay...I was also disappointed that they had ran out of dessert. I don't think I would go back for dinner, again."}
{"text":"This is honestly one of my favorite places to go in Madison. Whether it is summer or winter, there is no bad time to go to Rockhound Brewing. The giant windows that surround the dining area provide sunshine whether you are missing the sun in the winter, or hoping to not miss a drop of it in the summer. The first time my wife and I went was in the winter trying to put some joy in hour lives from months of cold. We went there and our spirits were instantly lifted from being simultaneously warm and basking in natural light (NOT something that goes together in Madison) We had the brunch on a Sunday morning and the food was everything we could have hoped for. The best comfort food we could find. Since then we have been back several times to enjoy more food and great ambiance as well as their beer, which is also great. The food is not the best place to go for healthy options, but there are other places for that. If you are feeling like a stuffed pig afterward, however, fear not, even the location is great. They are right across the street from Monona Bay on Lake Monona. A great place to walk off a few of the calories is a beautiful park to walk around right next to the lake. I have honestly no complaints about this place. the food is great, service friendly and efficient, and the ambiance is delightful and sunny (which I dont know if I made abundantly clear at the beginning of the post, can be a rare commodity in Madison in the winter)"}
{"text":"I went to @rockhoundbrewing after work last week. It was nice inside. They have a rectangular bar in the middle of the room. There were people sitting at the bar and tables. I got the Wild Rice + Mushroom Risotto Burger (#vegetarian). It was good. The bun was really good, moist, fresh, etc. I ordered the burger without herb aioli but thought the roasted garlic hummus would add enough flavor. I ended up adding barbecue sauce, which I ordered on the side for fries, for more flavor and the burger was great. Fries were also good. Crispy and everything Portions were good. It was $10. That was a pretty good price, it seemed more like a $11-$12 dish."}
{"text":"I've stopped in several times with different groups and each time the beer is definitely worth going back for but the food doesn't stick in my mind as amazing but satisfactory. I had the fish fry this last trip and the sweet potato fries were yummy and the piece of fish was large but over salted. The menu has a typical array of nicer bar food (i.e. burgers and sandwiches)  I enjoy a good number of their own tap options and I haven't found them bitter or hoppy which are tastes I avoid in beer. A flight is a great way to get started, especially when you go with a friend or a few friends. The service has been friendly both at the bar and table and who can complain about a clean bathroom that also offers ladies a basket of feminine products!  The atmosphere is cozy and when full can be noisy but that is how a bar on a Friday or Saturday night should be-at least in my opinion. Street parking can be tricky in that neighborhood but if you time it right, there is a small lot behind the bar."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and have been here a few times. The drinks selection is OK. They don't have too many of their own beers available yet because they just opened. The service is less than ideal. They didn't seem to know the specials that they had going on and either they don't come to your table at all or they're asking if you need anything a dozen times."}
{"text":"First off, I'm not a beer drinker. But I got to tour the rooms where the beer magic happens and Rock Hound has a pretty cool set-up -  a lot of thought went into setting up this brew pub. On a recent visit I enjoyed the cherry jubilee cider - and as someone who can sip a glass of cider all night long I really appreciated the option of a five ounce pour. Perfect for lunch or a light dinner drinker. Food is fine. The fried pickles were perfect and this a dish that can come out horribly wrong, but here the pickles were crisp, the exterior was crunchy, and it all held together surprisingly well. Rockhound's aoilis are great. I enjoy the ambiance and they've been engaged in community events, which is always good to see."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Rockhound Brewing!  We went on a Thursday for dinner and got seated right away. Our server, Sarah, was super sweet and helpful.  We each got a flight - you can get 3 or more so I got 4. I got Hoity Toity, Sandstone, Mosquito Bite and the T-Rex. I liked all of them but the T-Rex, but that's definitely just my taste. It was super super strong (12% ABV!!) and tasted a little sweet.  For food we got:  -The Pretzel Sticks with house-made beer mustard and the cheese sauce for an extra cost (worth it!). This was DELICIOUS. 3 were enough for the 2 of us - the pretzels were fresh and hot. The mustard had a little spice and the cheese was tasty!  -For the main dish, I got the market pot pie which was a vegetarian mix of beans and veggies similar to chili with a crispy puff pastry on top. I was so happy to hear it was vegetarian! It was pretty good, I ended up getting some hot sauce to pour on top (because this is what I always do).   Overall, we had a great experience with drinks, food and the staff. Can wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I love geology. I love beer. I love pub/comfort food. It's the closest bar and restaurant to my home. But, I have been consistently disappointed . I have been multiple times, wanting to give its fair go, and each time has been sub-par.  Their beer is fine, nothing to write home about. However, with the mason being basically next door, fine is not good enough.  The food is mediocre at best. The curds are sad; the coating is this weird cornmeal-y texture and they have been grease soaked every time I have had them. I am not the kind of girl to leave the last cheese curd, but I have left nearly whole baskets here. Honestly, none of the appetizers have impressed me. The burgers are very hit or miss; the mac and cheese burger is actually pretty bland, like it was literally just a burger with mac and cheese on it. It would be better with some caramelized onions or some other flavor to add a bit more depth. I had a blue cheese burger that was pretty good, but my side of fries was awful that time. Speaking of fries, go for the sweet potato fries, they're actually consistently good.  I suggest sitting at the bar to get the best service, table service at lunch has not been good in my experience. On two different occasions, while seated at a table, I've had to get up and search for my server to either actually order my food and search for her again to pay my bill. That being said, I like all of the bartenders that have served me, and I have always gotten great service at the bar. I love the ambiance. They've done a pretty good job curating guest taps.  So, I guess I'm not saying you shouldn't go there. Just have appropriate expectations and sit at the bar."}
{"text":"From the first night they opened until today I have had wonderful service, excellent food and awesome beer.  With it being incredibly busy the first night they opened the staff did a fantastic job on making sure everyone was happy.  Every time I have stopped in for a beer, lunch or just the amazing cheese curds I have left full and happy.  I can't wait to see what taps will be available next. The mosquito bite IPA is great. Not too hoppy but still has that kick that reminds you that it's an IPA.  Defiantly stop in and check them out!  The only complaint I can think to add is that they are not open 7 days a week  but everyone deserves a day off"}
{"text":"I came for dinner and some beers. Their beer is solid. They have a nice variety of beer. I tried the oatmeal pale ale (forget the name) and it was great.   Tried the chicken Parmesan bites for an appetizer and was disappointed. The chicken was dry and the breading had no flavor. The sauce was very bland and there wasn't much cheese. It was a very bland dish.   I had the Salmon BLT for my entree. The sandwich was fresh and light. They toasted the sourdough bread perfectly and had the right amount of ingredients. They did not skimp on the salmon, either. I would recommend if you're looking for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Very good brew pub, they were out of a couple beers but the pale and IPA were solid.  The adult grilled cheese was great, the extra cheese on the outside was a good touch.  It wasn't super busy so the staff was able to talk shop about how they are brewing the beer.  Had a chance to talk to owner and he has some great ideas for future beers."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, good vibes.  I had the Rosa Pasta which was delicious, and I highly recommend it (if you like mushrooms).  My family tried a bunch of different beers that they really liked. I don't love beer, but I tried the hard cider they had on tap and that was very enjoyable. It was also nice that the waitress let us sample all the drinks before we bought them.  Besides the friendly waitstaff, the overall vibe of the restaurant was warm, cozy, and modern. I recommended it to my roommate who is very particular about these things, and after she went she couldn't stop talking about it; even saying that it might be her new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Probably the best sweet potatoes fries I've ever had! Mmmm... and Wheat the F beer is very tasty!"}
{"text":"Food was not very good and over priced.  3/4 beers we ordered were flat.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Barely a 3-star. This place disappointed on a multitude of levels. First of all, it's way too close to the Mason to be inflicting it's particular brand of mediocrity Madison. If it weren't in such close proximity, it could get away more easily. The first impression was of how cold it was. It was about 85 degrees okay but it was actually cold in this place. It totally looks legit, but it totally looks too legit. It's exactly what you've come to expect from our times (reclaimed looking wood, artisanal lights [thanks Portlandia]) only corporate-ized and without any of the jagged edges or awkward quirks. It be easy to get over its lack of soul if the beer was better. The blonde ale tasted like not much, I didn't want to try the Hefe because of how cloudy it was, the porter was actually really good though and they had a lot of guest taps on. The menu was over priced but the food was good. On the other hand, the veggie pie wasn't a pie, it was a thick stew with a piece of puff pastry on top.  Yea..."}
{"text":"The only reason this gets even 2 stars is because of the good fried cheese curds we had. The beer I ordered which was supposed to be a cranberry saison tasted like a frat boys IPA brewing experiment gone wrong...my friends tasted it and agreed it wasn't just me, it was disgusting and certainly did not taste like a saison. Ordered a Moscow mule next and it tasted flat and weak. I heard from my local friends that the Mason next door is a great bar, but sadly they were closed since it was a Monday."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bluestone burger (bacon, fried onion, blue cheese, tomato jam, pretty good brioche-like bun) and it was very solid.  Good for brunch. Bacon is done extra crispy.   Beers are ok, the lighter ones, the lager and the blonde are the best in my opinion.  Notable for bike benefits: BOGO pints."}
{"text":"Went there with a 3-yr old and 5-yr old. Server asked if we wanted to put the kids order in first, which gets a big thumbs up from this parent. Kids menu had good variety but a bit pricey as sides aren't included. Daughter got the grilled PB&J and loved it; son had the bacon pizza and was also a fan. I had the hummus platter which was big and delicious! Husband had the Cubano which was also delicious but just a tad dry. Fries were right on the mark. He also had the Mosquito Bite beer, which he loved and wished he could take a growler home. We'll definitely be back. Fast service - prices not too bad. Only downside: hard to park!"}
{"text":"If you like cheeeeeeeese curbs you gotta try theirs. You won't be disappointed.  You don't have to be a veggie fan to love their root veggie fries and hummus.  I had their bluestone burger and would have it again!"}
