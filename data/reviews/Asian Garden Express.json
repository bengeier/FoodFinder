{"text":"We wanted to test out as much as we could so we ordered the vegetable fried rice (super good), the orange chicken (a little too much breading made the pieces hard) and the Buddah's delight/special (SUPER good). I will return for the primary dishes but the appetizers were so-so. They didn't match the quality and taste of what I've named so far. The egg rolls and potstickers tasted almost microwaved like something I would get at the store and make myself. Overall I'm still looking forward to eating here again just no appetizers."}
{"text":"First off, this place is was to miss. Keep your eyes peeled because you don't want to miss it. The food is good. I appreciate the fact that when you come in someone greets you. The menu is a bit overwhelming with all the yummy choices. When my food arrived it was fresh. You could obviously tell the food was not sitting under a heating lamp for hours. Over all, it's a cute, clean, and quiet place. Definitely comming back."}
{"text":"FINALLY A CHINESE RESTURANT NEAR ME. I have take out every week. The chicken fried rice is one of the best I've had. Thank you Lisa"}
{"text":"With all the good ratings on this place I decided to come and have a taste. It's a beautiful place for fast Chinese food. Beautiful decor. I got a menu and began too look.  I decided to try the 3 item and had it to go. The lady asked me of I wanted noodles or fried rice and I said fried rice. Then she preceded to complete the rest of the order. She said I was going to get orange chicken and veggies. Surprised that I was not allowed to order my main entree was strange. She wrote on a styrofoam container and disappeared. I an not a fan of orange chicken but decided that with all the high ratings that I mine as well try.  I also ordered a side of spring rolls. I got my order and went home. I got one spring roll that was soggy and fell apart when I tried to pick it up and no sit sauce, napkins or even a fortune cookie.  Just a fork. The main entree was rice. It took over half of the container and a bunch of vegetables. I only got a tiny amount of orange chicken. Only 9 small peices. Not going here again. It was good but I wish I was able to pick what I wanted for y main entree and side."}
{"text":"Excellent! Definitely on my repeat business list. Food was great and the delivery was extremely quick."}
{"text":"I called in to ask if they offered \"brown rice\" and the lady told me that they do. So I decided to give this place a little visit. MY WORST MISTAKE EVER!!!   As I put in my order,  I asked for the \"brown rice\" and the lady is now telling me that they only brown rice that they have is their \"fried rice\". REALLY?!!   I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt (blaming it on the language barrier), so I went forward and ordered the wantong soup..... It was the WORST soup I have ever tasted (no flavor at all).   So not only was I lied to, but the food is not up to par. Who knows what they are selling you, while telling you that it is chicken?  Just like they tried telling me that \"brown rice\" is actually \"fried rice\".... I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is the best. The owner and staff were so welcoming. The food is great. Always feel relaxed and comfortable there.  You really must visit. Gina"}
{"text":"Excellent  service,  we order delivery, we didn't  get  our whole order, but ten minutes  later they brought  the rest without  being called.  Love the food"}
{"text":"Went in with family around 7pm, amazing service, clean tables, restroom, etc. The server was amazing, and was helpful on menu sugesstions, and just fun overall. I will definitely come back again, and recommend that you try it."}
{"text":"The customer service here is incredibly outstanding. They have great prices, and even better food. Very fast service times, they deliver to a certain radius (which has fast delivery times), and has a very nice visual appeal inside the restaurant itself. I look forward to every time I come back to be able to try something different each time."}
{"text":"Close to the house so we thought we would try it. General Tso's chicken, Mongolian beef and veggie fried rice were great. Portion size was good and food was very fresh.  Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place. My sister and I were greeted by a friendly smile as we walked in. The lady provided outstanding customer service.  We placed an order for the family dinner which was at a very reasonable price for the amount and delicious food."}
{"text":"I was immediately greeted the moment I walked in.  The lady behind the counter was extremely nice and helpful.  I ordered take out and got general tso tofu. It was made fresh and packaged properly so no spills or issues.  It was delish! Great flavor! I would definitely return and will recommend it.  Wish I took a picture but I started eating immediately."}
{"text":"We placed a big order for a fast delivery. We got what we asked for. Great service, excellent food. We will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Just ok....the wanton soup was greasy and the wanton were nothing but mush...ewwwww.  Hot and sour soup good taste but way too much tofu for me.  Ordered shrimp fried rice it was good but when will Asian restaurants learn that those hard carrots and peas are not good.  Crab puffs were good.  May give it another try...but not if I find something better!"}
{"text":"Correct order, good delivery time.  Food piping hot.  Extremely nice lady. Fantastic food"}
{"text":"Wanted to try as they just opened and are very close to me. Ordered wonton soup, chicken lo mein and an egg roll. Everything was quite tasty but that lo mein was easily some of the best I've had in a while. Absolutely worth trying if you're  ordering some oriental food, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Looking for somewhere to get a quicky lunch and stopped in Asian Garden Express to give it a try. Was not disappointed. Very sweet lady working there, delicious food and prices fair.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Have dined in twice and had delivery several times.  I've not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Very clean place! My first time walking in and I had asked for a sample and they said they didnt have any because they make everything fresh! I was kind of skeptical about how my food would taste because of how much food I bought but thankfully I am a very satisfied customer & will be back again! The sesame chicken & orange chicken is really good as well as the mixed vegetables! I live 20 mins from this place and my food was still hot when I got home."}
{"text":"I travel weekly and just happened upon this hidden gem for lunch. The food was cooked fresh and was delicious. The service was great and the folks were friendly and accommodating. Great prices and serving size just right. I highly recommend this place for lunch and I would bet dinner is even better."}
{"text":"Coming back so that means it was great Chinese food. Fresh, hot & delicious! Thanks for saving our lives..."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on a Friday night and received our order surprisingly fast! Food was very good, tasted fresh, and still nice and hot when we received it. Woman who took the phone order was very friendly. Order of large orange chicken came with a side of white rice. Nice big portions my boyfriend I were able to split a large rice and large chicken order and still have left overs. Will definitely be ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today.  Grand opening sign in the front. An experienced Chinese chef cooking for you in the back. It was GOOD and CHEAP!!!  What's not to love?  I took home their full menu and I'll be calling them for home delivery next. Yummy for my tummy... while I get to stay home and be bummy."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!!!!! Lady kept throwing food in \"you like a this you like a that\" she already chooses your next item and then says ok you need a vegetable so annoying.. When she totaled everything it came out to $60.00 seriously the food wasn't that great never never again!!! Yeah it's nice and clean inside but for some cheap looking coconut shrimp and because it was Sunday everything on the menu you add $1.00 it wasn't even that good.  To much batter!!!  my husband ordered curry pork nasty!! Too much stuff in it couldn't even enjoy it.. We were told all our items come with rice.. So when our food came we asked for the rice and all we got was a small place with 2 scoops of rice we also had orange chicken, and the Singapore chow mei fun... And supposedly she gave us free spring rolls but after coming home and totaling everything I am so annoyed $60 and yet when you eat in the portions look so small and I am sure she charged us for the large of everything never never again.. Don't even try it.. Save your money an find a place worth trying.. This one wasnt"}
{"text":"We were sweating sitting at our booth, A/C must be set at 85.. Zero service by the young girl. No greeting no thank you. Ordered at counter then waited and waited. Twenty minutes later, the meal was brought out, with soup at the same time. Hot and Sour soup was terrible said hubby. Meals tasted good, generous portions, Kung Pao and Chicken with Vegetables, but half the plate was white rice. That was our first and last visit. Other Chinese restaurants do it better!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for a quick lunch.  Wish I didn't.  Yes the place was clean and yes the staff was wonderful.  I also love to hear the my food getting cooked fresh coming straight from the kitchen.  Love the sounds of sizzling and woks getting banged up.  But... I really have had better with flavor.  The lunch special is not all that great for the price.  I thought it would be until I walked up to the counter. I did read in one review that the eggroll was falling apart. So did mine.  I did not finish because it was not good at all.  The sweet and sour sauce was watery but that's ok I really don't like sweet and sour anyway.  I ordered the chicken and vegetable lunch special.  It was ok.  Nothing great to where I am going to invite my co workers or ever come back to have a quick bite.  I will also let you all know please do not try the hot and sour soup. Very tasteless. It had absolutely no flavor. If I closed my eyes and took a bite of it I would think it was warm thickened water... Water Gravy with small bits of tofu and mushrooms.  I know that there are a lot of wonderful reviews for Asian Garden and that is all good for them but not so much for me. Sorry not one of my faves. I wish them well. Merry Christmas!"}
{"text":"we had the sweet and sour chicken, excellent. potstickers were great too. we had fried rice and look me in. both were very good. the service was quick and they were very friendly.. oh yes and the egg rolls were amazing...."}
{"text":"Good fresh food and they are family owned! Everything we have ordered here has been good! They are from the east coast I believe. the sweet & sour sauce is super bomb! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Ate in  - ordered King Po Chicken with some Shrimp added - the chicken was odd shaped, not a good taste and the rice appeared old (crunchy) or under cooked. I defined have co e across other small places that the chicken had a good appearance and the Shrimp was larger for around the same price.  Tried this place out - trying to find a good Chinese Restaurant close to home.  Will need to cont to looking."}
{"text":"Fist and only time we get food from this place we only order because our favorite place at 6721 Bethany home was closed . We should have waited  the price was almost double and food was bad."}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is good. The owners are very kind. Best place in the area for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Asian Garden is a real groovy concept. The most common dishes are ordered cafeteria-style. They're already made and ready to go, at the low low price of $7.50 for a whopping 3-entree plate.   I wasn't in the hurry, and I was there rather late, my dining companion and I ordered some stuff to go. First, of course was my usual sesame chicken, which they loaded up with garlic! Over 12 hours later, I still am glad I don't have a date today. :-p   The vegetarian, or even vegan options are where I think this place shines. The #44 (some type of flat noodles with vegetables) was delicious, and perhaps next time I'll ask for it spicy. My vegetarian dining companion was delighted to see vegetarian egg rolls, as virtually every other place puts some type of meat in theirs.   Service was courteous, and the manager was very delighted to show us some unique recommendations. I'm coming back for sure.   PS--if you live nearby, they deliver!"}
{"text":"Great food! My coworkers and I ordered a delivery order. I placed the order at 10:50am and the food was deliver at 11:15am all the food was hot and delicious. Will definitely be ordering from here again. We got an order of vegetable rolls,crab puffs, chicken Lo main,shrimp Lo main,sweet and sour chicken,beef and broccoli,and orange chicken,everyone love it."}
{"text":"Average takeout Chinese, I didn't actually get what I ordered so that was a surprise...and again it wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. If you want to grab some quick nondescript Chinese takeout, this will do, if you are looking for something in particular and are willing to put in an ounce of effort maybe try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever!!!!!! Super happy I ordered from , everything cooked to perfection and the delivery was super fast!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to try. I was in dire need of some Chinese takeout style but for delivery and this place had everything I wanted. I tried 4 items off the menu and starting with the orange chicken, it was your average orange chicken. The sweat and sour chicken was also okay but very light tasting, the sauce was kinda soft almost watered down but still not bad. Noodles, again nothing special but not bad. But the roasted pork fried rice was my fave. This is your typical Chinese take out and the customer service and delivery guy were nice."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go to me and my brother practically eat here every day Lisa the owner is a very good person so is the Chef Sonny best cook I would highly recommend this place for the best Chinese food"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and tasty. My husband and I usually order delivery and it gets to our house quick and hot, which is important because who wants cold food. Plus, they are super nice when I call to order."}
