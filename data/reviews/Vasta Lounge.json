{"text":"Vasta is an unappealing bar with a rough crowd. There have been many fights here. My most recent visit to this place, we couldn't even order a drink! Standing at the bar for 5 minutes before walking out. Bar was very sticky and you could tell it hadn't been cleaned in awhile.

Two stars because it's right next to Tom's Diner and at least you can carryout beer next door at Tom's Beer."}
