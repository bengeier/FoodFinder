{"text":"A petit fast cafeteria style restaurant with wine and beer, plentiful patio space surrounded by beautiful garden backdrops. Even better-- it's open to the public, so no admission needed! Restaurant du Jardin's located just before the ticketed entrance of the Botanical Gardens.   We couldn't have had a better lunch after exploring Le Stade. A feast for the eyes after walking around blah beigey concrete all morning. Since it was raining on and off throughout the day, we took refuge inside the restaurant. Between the three of us, we split the meat and veggie entree of the day (poulet/chicken and a falafel-like croquette), plus the soup du jour (tomato). Both entrees were flavorful, plated beautifully with fresh greens. I'd expect no less given its surroundings.   Inside seating was limited by four tables and counter seats. On a nicer day, I'd see people spilling out onto the patio. I highly recommend stopping by for a bite if you're ever around Parc Olympique!"}
{"text":"What a dream of a place. Live jazz and a beautiful ambiance. Cute date spot food was okay. We shared a poke bowl with tuna sashimi... not great, but not bad. Worth a visit. Charming place!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible - the food is mediocre and expensive, the seating is not comfortable - the list goes on and on.   There are better places for the same money - don't waste yours."}
{"text":"Three stars for the location: good sandwiches in an overpriced, rough cafeteria setting. I had a good turkey sandwich with nice celery-fennel soup. My hot chocolate was residual chocolate sludge from a drained machine. It's right outside the entrance to the Botanical Garden, and the windows do look out on the gardens a bit. However, the feel is very much that of an institutional cafeteria, for about twice what you'd normally pay. Great spot if you're hungry and right there, otherwise eat before you head to the gardens."}
{"text":"Rien à manger pour les enfants, les produits ne sont pas de bonnes qualité et pas bien cuits. Peu de choix et cher. Nothing to eat for children, products are not good quality ans kit well cooked. Not so Manu choice ans expensive."}
{"text":"This is the best, and only place, to purchase some food or drink while visiting the Botanical Gardens or the Insectarium.  There is a pretty comprehensive cafeteria style setup here, but they will not sell you a breakfast croissant that is on display in the case after they stop serving breakfast.  The tea bags for hot tea are also not by the hot water.  You will need to turn around and look for them on a counter that is part of the main food display cases."}
{"text":"This is the only place you can eat while at the gardens. They do offer a combo meal (salad or soup with meal and juice) for $10+. I do find the offers lacking. The sandwiches are on the small side and they stuff it with some type if greens that's hard. Like eating branches. I threw that out. I had the chicken sandwich. Did not care for the bun. The salad and soup choices are on the meh side too.   Service is ok. It's cafeteria style service."}
{"text":"Not bad for a little cafeteria style lunch spot at a museum type attraction. The veggie sandwich on olive bread with carrot salad side was actually pretty good. The outdoor seating is pleasant, overlooking a side garden. It definitely provided the rest and refueling needed after a long hot morning walking the large grounds of the Botanical Garden."}
{"text":"This self service restaurant is located outside the entrance to the Botanical Gardens so you can go even if you're visiting the Olympic Parc, the Biodome, or are in the area. You'll have to queue around the oval bar and can choose from daily hot meals, sandwiches, and salads. The are some tables inside but if it's not too cold you can sit in the spacious outside area. A combo of a vegetarian meal with salad, soup, and a drink from the juice fountain costs $15. If you only want a snack, you can get a vege pate sandwich for $6.50. They also have muffins, desserts, and ice cream. The place serves its purpose but could do with a little more charm or character. Anyhow the salads impressed me and were better than average so I do recommend coming here, especially after a long walk through the gardens."}
