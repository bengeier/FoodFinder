{"text":"My favourite place to grab a cider and a sunburn on Sundays. Situated on Dundas and Dovercourt, Loveless has a great patio with several picnic benches and a few high tops overlooking the Dundas commotion.   Good coffee, cold brew on tap, good selection of beers and excellent cocktails (albeit, expensive). Perfect venue for hair of the dog, but feels a bit low key at night."}
{"text":"The best coffee and they have coconut milk that goes perfectly with their cold brew. The owner, Jamal, is super friendly and will talk you through the flavours of patties... Who knew jerk pork could be so amazing!"}
{"text":"Jamal did an excelled job welcoming me. I had a couple drinks and some good conversations. He is very friendly and made me feel welcomed. The menu is very creative. A must check in for any drinks - non alcoholic or alcoholic. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Unfriendly staff. I really wanted to like this place so I came by for two separate mornings maybe about two weeks apart and was faced with probably the most rude and unwelcoming customer service I have ever encountered. It was super disappointing because this place seemed really great and my friend had recommended it too. Will never go back or recommend it to others. Coffee was just okay as well. If you're overworked and tired, then please take it out on your friends or manager. Not your customers."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is extremely relaxed, good ambiance, good beer, nice staff.  One of my fave places to grab a drink before dinner."}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees. If you want a latte or a beer this place has it and in the summer you chills outside.   11/5 stars, real talk. One time."}
{"text":"I walked by with the Hubster on a beautiful, hot day. They had a busy patio, but we managed to score a couple of seats. The atmosphere is super casual, with small picnic-type seating. You had to go inside and order at the bar and bring your drinks out, but that wasn't a big deal. They provided bottles and glasses of water, which was very necessary.  Service was friendly and they had a good cider on tap and a few varieties of Ace Hill beer, which we liked. Tall boys ran us $7 each.  Definitely a nice spot to have a drink and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Loveless is a good name for this place because their staff really don't seem to give AF if you're there or not.  No effort in making you feel welcome but more of a DIY kinda place anyway which is how they appear to want to be viewed.  I guess its the new trend. Nice atmosphere 5 stars. Service 1 star. Loveless."}
{"text":"This place wins me over as it's one of the few West facing patios on this stretch of Dundas West.  But aside from the patio, there isn't much keeping me excited. Beer summary: A select grouping of craft tallboys, and a handful of unexciting tap options coming in between $6-$8. Food summary: Jamaican patties for $3.50 each. And last time I came, sandwiches that are premade and sit in a fridge (while supplies last) for $9.   Perhaps if I was a coffee shop/cafe type of guy I'd see more charm in the place, but otherwise it's just a fall-back spot to visit still worthy of the 3 stars."}
{"text":"A comfortable cafe/coffee house to hang out in especially when it is pouring rain outside which happened to me the other day. The front garage door was wide open and it was great to see and smell the rain without getting wet. The coffee is good as is the cucumber lemonade which I've never had anywhere else. Very laid back scene with no attitude at all."}
{"text":"Loveless is awesome.   Not only do they play the catchiest tunes but they offer a great work space during the day and a wonderful bar to meet up with friends at night.  If you don't have high expectations, you're guaranteed a great time. The simplicity of this place is what makes it so special!   I definitely recommend giving it a try if you live in the area!"}
{"text":"I've only been here at night when it converts from a cafe to a bar. It's not an overly fancy place, but the ambiance is both buzzy and intimate at the same time, and it's really just a solid space for some one-on-one time or to just unwind with a small group of friends. Comfy green couches must be a hit with people looking for the former. Pretty decent selection of beers/ciders. I haven't tried any of their cocktails yet, but look forward to it."}
{"text":"Cozy little cafe/bar, great for spending a lazy afternoon. They have a good amount of seating -- not good for big groups (only 1 table for 4), but it's more of the kind of place to come read a book on your own or catch up in an intimate setting. It's table service unlike most coffee shops. Standard espresso drinks as well as some cocktails and beers (I just had a cappuccino). Look out for the taxidermy animals at the bar - kind of random!"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall with a very laid back easy vibe, with excellent Mexican inspired cocktails and a nice patio. In an as yet undiscovered Toronto neighborhood- no Starbucks!"}
{"text":"one of the best spots in town. Dundas West's Holy Oak, but with a great patio and radlers on tap. No jokes!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: A cozy, and licensed, cafe!  A mix between a dive bar/cafe and a place with table service, Loveless has a cozy corner spot in this up-and-coming neighbourhood. The layout of the cafe includes very tiny tables by the windows, tables for 2 on one side, and a small couch area for 4 on the other side. They serve your regular cafe offerings along with some pastries, though I might recommend trying something besides the PAIN-AU-CHOCOLAT, which was quite doughy.   I'll have to come back when it's warmer to sample their patio and cocktails. They have, IIRC, 3-4 beers on tap, but for the life of me, I can't remember what they were. More reason to come back, I guess! Definitely worth checkout if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Loveless is quickly becoming a regular in my cafe rotation. In addition to the obvious benefit of it being very close to my house, its open all damn day. Well, basically. During the week, when I do they bulk of my cafe sitting, its open 7am to 9pm*. I love this because I can go have a coffee in the morning while I do my work, or if I've struggled to find motivation during the day, I can still get out of the house to be productive with a tea at 7pm. Also, sometimes a girl just needs a glass of wine with her email writing, and Loveless is there for you on that front too.   The staff here are also super chill and the music is always great. The place could use a few more outlets, but thats about it.   *Its open till 3am on weekends, but thats a whole other horse colour."}
{"text":"A quaint little bar in Toronto's west end with an old world charm and a laid back atmosphere. The soft chairs, dim light and taxidermy gives this spot a cozy cottage feel. The bartender plays soft trance beats while you drink. Great spot to just have a conversation.  I've only tried the bar at night so can't say much about the coffee during the day, but bar drinks include a variety of tequila based mixes and imported European beers. Stiegl on the lighter side and English ales on the darker.  Not really a dive bar i.e. a little more upscale. In fact, very reminiscent of the Brooklyn bar scene down in New York."}
