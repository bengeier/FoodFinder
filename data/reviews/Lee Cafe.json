{"text":"Excellent Chinese food. We tried all of the staple take out items we usually get and found everything to be well above all the other Chinese take outs around. Steamed dumplings and crab rangoons were great. Fried rice was excellent. Everything was made fresh and quality of the ingredients was evident. I even tried a tuna roll and was surprised to find not only great quality raw fish, but the rice was perfect, very balanced roll. Next time we will order from the Chinese menu for more traditional foods."}
{"text":"On the strength of one of the online reviews, I stopped in today and had the Shanghai wontons (an appetizer for two but a meal for one!). They were exquisite. I can't speak to authenticity, not being Chinese or having traveled there, but I have had great Chinese food in many of the great Chinatowns in the US (San Francisco, New York, Boston, Houston, etc.) and this was as good as it gets. Who'd ever think that a place in a strip mall in Fort Mill, SC, could be this good?!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a decent Szechuan Chinese restaurant in Charlotte ever since Dynasty Cuisine in Matthews closed a couple of years ago. My search is now over - and they really exceeded my expectations. 

I'd say that my review is based on the traditional Chinese menu, with many traditional Szechuan offerings and also a few Cantonese items such as the beef chow fun as well.

The two dishes I had were both very authentic. No corners were cut (see pics I posted), and i dare say that they are the only Chinese place in Charlotte I know of so far who knows how to cook Chinese/Szechuan dishes properly. I can't wait to go back to experience their other offerings on the traditional menu."}
{"text":"The most authentic Chinese/Asian food i've ever had in the Carolinas. Probably even better than all those places in Atlanta Chinatown. Food is great, servers are really personable and responsive."}
{"text":"Lee Cafe was recommended by friends as the the best/most authentic Chinese restaurant in the Charlotte area, so we checked it out. It's located right down the road from Carowinds. We were there for lunch and had no problem getting a table. At first glance of the menu given, the dishes were not that different from what you would find in any mall food court: General Chicken, Mongolian Beef, etc. I got the Beef with Broccoli which came with egg fried rice...again, mall food court fare and tasted as such. As I looked around the dining room, I noticed other parties with elaborate dishes and asked the waitress about some of them. She gave us another menu with \"authentic\" Chinese dishes listed. This is why we came! She pointed out some dishes we saw and we made note of it for our return trip the next day.

So we finally ended up trying the Salt & Spices Tofu (breaded deep fried tofu), Sizzling Steak Black Pepper Sauce (brought out on a hot skillet similar to fajitas), and the Szechuan Spicy Fish Filet. The tofu was all right, seasoned well although maybe it could've been served with a dipping sauce the way Vietnamese fried tofu is served (or is that just a Vietnamese thing, IDK). The sizzling steak had an authentic ethnic/Chinese (I guess) taste to it, but the more I ate, the more I enjoyed! However, it was the Szechuan Spicy Fish Fillet that we were eager to try. This is the dish that everyone was eating! It came out in a large bowl with nothing but fried chilies on top. The fish was underneath the chilies swimming in chili oil and bean sprouts. My mistake was popping a piece of fish into my mouth right away without letting it cool first, thereby burning my tongue. I wasn't wowed as much as my wife was over this dish. It was just OK. I'm not sure if it was because I burned my tongue, but I found it very bland. Oh well, there are lots of other dishes on the real menu to explore. If you're the adventurous type, ask for the authentic Chinese menu when you're here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I frequent here once a week, if not twice! The service is great, the ladies are so kind and courteous. My favorite dish is the chow fun from the traditional menu for dinner and Sushi B for lunch. Heads up: It does get very busy weekend nights so it may take a while to get through the phone to place a pick-up order. It's worth it."}
{"text":"They have a large menu that contains typical \"Chinese american\", but theur treasure is their traditional Chinese dishes. The ginger scallion flounder is extremely flavorful. We also love their sweet pork in bone. Its bite size pork in bone pieces that is braised with thinly sliced onion in a sauce. It was very tender. The twice cooked pork is great, and the snow pea tips. 

 Every time we go, we always get at least 4 dishes. And about 6 adults would need that many each time. Every dish, each time, has not disappoint. The restaurant is smaller, so if you plan on going with a bigger party, call ahead. The staff is very nice and good service."}
{"text":"Food 7/10:
1. Salted fish, chicken and eggplant in a clay pot
2. Oysters, tofu and baby bok choy in a clay pot.  (The tofu was the star of this dish) 
3. Lobster sautéed in a ginger sauce 
4. Grilled shrimp in a ?black soybean sauce
Served with jasmine rice.  

Service 5/10 Our 'assigned' waitress brought out the dishes, but no rice. We waited, but did not see her. So we tried to ask another waitress about it she scoffed and walked off saying she wasn't our waitress.  Pretty rude. Even if that were the case she should have said let me send your waitress to help you. 

Cost: 1-3 Were $18-22 per dish and 4-$35. Not bad, but if you want the most food for your $ this isn't your place. 

Overall pretty tasty food, but not quite as delicious as Wan Fu (my fave Chinese restaurant in 704) was back in the 90s-00s. Worth a try though. Planning to return and try some of the more classic Szechuan dishes."}
{"text":"Usually like this place but their service getting worse and worse! You need to ask your every single stuff including chop sticks and napkins ...etc 
Well NOT going BACK!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  The food was fabulous as was the service.  I was very happy with the amount of food for your money.  While it's in a little strip mall, they have done a nice job of renovating the inside.  Definitely a keeper!!"}
{"text":"This appears to be the real deal.   Despite my preference for 
the real deal, I ordered General Tso's Chicken from the lunch 
menu while my mother had the eggrolls.  Both options were 
exceptional.  Good traffic slightly after lunch time.  I will be 
going back for the authentic Szechuan dishes and sushi.   
Restrooms very clean!!!  Nice.  Glad we have this on the 
south side."}
{"text":"Great place to get Asian food in fort mill.
Can't beat the price and the amount of food you get for it. I am never able to finish my plate and always take half of it home.

We usually go there Friday's at lunch and they are great in taking our phone orders and having the food ready and placed on the table as we walk in. Great service and the food is good as well."}
{"text":"One of the few places around that I am aware of that has \"authentic Chinese foods!)
The service is amazing, food fresh, portions large.
If it was closer to my home I would be there everyday. The have an Authentic Chinese menu and a regular menu with more familiar items. Everything is amazing.
Luv this place."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The most authentic Chinese cuisine I have find in Charlotte.  The Sichuan dishes are so delicious.   After travelling through China in the Summer I was so pleased to discover this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this restaurant. From Sushi to traditional Chinese....we have never had a bad meal here! Not over priced AT ALL!!!"}
{"text":"HOORAY! Found an amazing and delicious Chongqing chicken (they call it chili chicken). Best restaurant meal I've had since moving from NYC a year ago (great for takeout, too). Call before heading over as it is popular and you may not be able to get a seat."}
{"text":"Finally, I found a really authentic Chinese (Sichuan) restaurant in Clt area. Their crispy tofu and seafood hot pot is a must. I also learnt that they have a Japanese Sushi Chef. I will try this next time."}
{"text":"Pretty good.. had sweet and sour chicken.. i had to have them reheat the food but otherwise it was tasty"}
{"text":"I went here with my chinese class and I had a very delightful time. The food was very good and authentic at a very fair price for the quality of the food. Definitely the best Chinese restaurant around."}
{"text":"Singapore rice noodle is my favourite. Good sczechuan foods and many authentic chinese to choose. We been there many times and best chinese restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"Lee Cafe is an unassuming restaurant located in a strip mall next to a Food Lion off of Highway 21. Whoever said \"location, location, location\" is key has never been to Lee Cafe. It's simply amazing. 

In reality there are 2 Lee Cafes. There's the Americanized Chinese food version on the front of the menu. Pretty standard fare. And then there is the authentic Chinese version in the back of the menu. And my oh my is it authentic. 

When the waitress (who was PHENOMENAL) saw my wife and I perusing the dishes in the back of the menu she brought us a tablet where we could scroll through a TON of \"real\" dishes (photo and English names for each). When the waitress learned we both spoke Chinese it got real and we started talking about the different dishes. My wife and I picked three dishes for lunch: Seafood and Tofu Claypot, Spicy Fish, and Chinese Water Spinach (kongxincai). The third dish wasn't on the menu but when we talked with the waitress we learned it was in season and available. At her suggestion we also had it prepared the Southern Chinese way. 

The flavor of each dish was incredible. It felt like we were in Taiwan or Southern China instead of South Carolina. My wife, who was born in Taiwan and grew up in the US, said it reminded her of her father's home cooking. The claypot had flavors I haven't tasted since my last trip to Taiwan in 2011. The spicy fish was epic; just the right flavor and spice. 

My wife and I didn't talk too much during lunch as we were busy stuffing our mouths. Each bite tasted better than the last. It's pretty rare to find a good Chinese restaurant in the States. I had Lee Cafe bookmarked on Yelp for a year but slept on it until today. I have a lot of time to make up for. My tummy is already thanking me. 

I'm stingy on stars but this one deserves five of them. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Quaint and tasty. First-time visit based on Yelp reviews. 

There were three of us. We ordered hibachi chicken, hibachi steak & shrimp, dragon rolls, volcano rolls and California rolls. Sushi was fresh and well-prepared. Volcano roll was a little sweet for my liking. Hibachi was awesome. Everything was cooked perfectly and had that savory flavor I was craving. 

Wait staff was very attentive (dining room was about a quarter full) and friendly.

They don't have \"yum-yum\" sauce. This was a bummer. 

Would recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Random stop passing through the area. Great food with excellent service.

Spicy dishes aren't too spicy, so if you like it hot ask for extra spicy."}
{"text":"I love everything about it and it's our go to for authentic Chinese food. Best in the Charlotte area even though it's a 30 minute drive for us..... Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Great for a quick lunch for either sushi of traditional Chinese. I had the sesame chicken combination with fried rice steamed broccoli two crab Rangoon and fruit.   The fried rice was very flat not many vegetables of flavor.  The temperature was luke warm so it is most likely held for the lunch rush.  Fruit was three orange wedges the other choice was cake.  Over all not bad for $7.95 including a soft drink ot tee.  Lunch sushi seemed a bit high for one roll and four nagri pieces $12.95."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get authentic Chinese food. Recommend the tofu, the tendon, and the fried pork chop."}
{"text":"Absolutely worth every penny you spend. By far the best Chinese food in or around the Charlotte area. They have all of the \"American\" Chinese food dishes but the real deal is in the szechuan menu. Can't read but they have an iPad with pictures and descriptions. The thick noodles are amazing"}
{"text":"Lots of choices with many new options not normally found locally.  The staff is attentive and offered up a visual tablet to help with choices.  That was a nice touch to see items. I  ordered sushi and it could have been wrapped tighter, the seaweed wrap was extra chewy and could of been a bit colder, but tasty.  A order of honey chicken came out in a large dish, enough for two.  The fried rice does not have eggs or veggies in it, but was tasty.    Fried ragoons were hot and filled with delicious crab mixture.   I saw so many items to try for the next visit.    Place does a huge take out business."}
{"text":"I am happy to finally find an authentic Chinese restaurant with decent Sichuan food in Charlotte. I've been coming g here for a year and it's my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. I always ordered from their Chinese menu. All of their hot pot dishes (seafood, salted fish, tofu and chicken and the salted fish, chicken and eggplants) are great. I always couldn't decide which one to order since I like all of them. The dry chili chicken, salt and spices tofu, black and pepper beef, salt and pepper soft shell crab are all delicious."}
{"text":"Based on the other reviews, had very high expectations.  They were not met, it was very average at best.  The fried rice had little flavor, the chicken was chewy, and the cake...  Don't waste the calories.  Service was slow at a time when the restaurant was not particularly busy.  On the plus side, it was not expensive."}
{"text":"GREAT AUTHENTIC CHINESE. Came here after finding it on Yelp. An amazing, local, authentic, and nice Chinese joint. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The waitress helped me pick from the traditional menu and I ended up with chilli chicken. It was amazing. A little bit crispy and spicy. Not too spicy. Just right. This is a must eat joint for a Chinese food lover in the Charlotte area. 


The bathrooms are super nice too! A+"}
{"text":"If you are in the Carowinds area you need to check this place out. Great sushi/nigiri and large rolls. Chinese food is good too, the beef and broccoli was terrific. Good job with the decor. Prices are reasonable and the service couldn't be better."}
{"text":"good over all but watch the 5.99 lunch special it add up to over 10.00 if you get egg roll and soup and beverage"}
{"text":"I'm from Long Island, NY where there is an abundance of quality authentic Asian restaurants so after moving to SC 10 years ago I thought I'd never come close to having \"real\" Chinese food again. Lee Cafe is even better than some of the best restaurants in NY! The test was the wonton soup.....all of the other restaurants in the area serve dishwater- tasteless, bland. Lee's is phenomenal! Every dish we've ordered has been fresh and delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I lived in China for 2 years and this is the restaurant with the closest to authentic Chinese food. I love that they have a menu divided into two parts - more American Chinese food and more authentic. Everything I've tried has been delicious."}
{"text":"(NOTE: slight update - something has changed here ... the Spicy Chili Chicken has dropped in quality and flavor: meaning the past few times this dish has been greasy (normally very dry and crispy) and it is lacking the saltiness, spiciness and numbing effect... don't know what changed in the kitchen but it is not for the better. 

I will say the rest of the traditional style dishes Sichuan are still pretty good. Last note: they are now offering Cantonese style dishes too. 

I am not ready to downgrade my rating but I am thinking about.... below is my original post.) 

Sichuan Chinese is starting to come the Charlotte area, finally. This is first really, really good Sichuan food that is consistently frequented by many Asians from the area. 

The atmosphere is sufficient and the service is typically to friendly Chinese style. 

Sichuan Wonton in Chili Oil - very good, not my favorite but get this pretty often
Spicy Chili Chicken - Chinese peppery and numbing, nice crispy, saltiness and citrus flavor. This dish is so good, if you like this then you're a true Sichuan lover. 
Fish in Hot Chili Oil - the fish is soft, supple and flavorful with plenty of bean spouts. The bean spouts is that tastiness that I ever had because bean spouts are usually so bland. 
Beef in Hot Chili Oil - good, would get a again... the fish was better
Sizzling Beef - again, really good and worth trying
Twice Cooked Pork - nice pork belly dish with plenty of flavor"}
{"text":"Super authentic Sichuan cooking in SC? Words I would never thought I would ever type. Located right across the NC/SC border in a supermarket plaza is this place. It's well decorated and clean - a big plus to some of the places I am used to visiting. I was promptly seated and ordered my Sichuan favorite, the \"water cooked fish fillet\" in Chinese. It is basically their Szechuan style fish filet. Fish fillets and chili peppers and peppercorns are placed inside a bowl as extremely hot oil is placed into the bowl which melds all the flavors together while cooking it. 
The dish is supposed to be very spicy but the preparation here may have been tamed down a little bit, I didn't find it spicy at all, which was disappointing! I was also only given one bowl of rice for a large family style dish. 

Service was good. 

All in all still a good experience. Would likely return!"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed their spicy chili chicken and beef chow fun. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I've had in NC. Very flavorful and authentic. The place is always full of Asian customers which must be a good sign. Be sure to order from the classic Chinese menu not the American Chinese menu. The sushi is really excellent also!"}
{"text":"I ordered sushi. They wanted like 12 bucks for a roll. For real? I pay approximately 2.50 per roll, three times the size of the peanut sizes they give. so it's safe to say this place will never make it. Especially since they close during the day when people want to eat. Outrageous prices. However, the lunch menu is fair game. Good price and you get a lot with that. They better be getting there sushi from some magical fairy land to be charging as much as they do."}
{"text":"I recently returned from a trip to China to find that a great, beautifully authentic Chinese restaurant has popped up right in my home town. I love practicing my Chinese with the owner, who clearly has a passion for helping Americans experience one of the best parts of Chinese culture- the amazing food! This is the real thing, right out of Sichuan- nothing like the Americanized version we normally get in in the Charlotte area. Please, everyone, go here! Get a real taste of China:)"}
{"text":"I love Lee cafe so much. their food is amazing and the service is perfect. I drive thirty minutes from Charlotte just to eat here. My favorite item is the bone In cooked pork with the chili sauteed green beans. it be having me shook bruh for real. always worth it. The portions are always more than generous. 

I love forward to my next trip there."}
{"text":"They actually have authentic Chinese food which tastes amazing. Also their service is wonderful. I do recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Delicious American and authentic Chinese food!! I go here at least once a week for either sushi or some of their Cantonese dishes. Great customer service. Worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Chinese and one of the best in Charlotte area! Try the steamed flounder filet with ginger and scallions it is right out of Chinatown NY"}
{"text":"Finally an authentic Chinese restaurant!   Delicious! I had a tofu dish that was incredible.   My kids liked their entrees too.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like cooking, so I stopped by Lee Café for a carry-out of Shrimp Fried Rice.  While I was not wowed by the fried rice, I was not disappointed with it.  The portion size was good and there was enough to have the next day.

The ambiance was nice and the staff was friendly.  If I am in the area and want Chinese food, I may stop by again."}
{"text":"Who knew there was a hidden gem located right down the street! I saw an article about Lee Cafe in the Charlotte Observer when i realized i lived close by. 

I just got the regular garlic chicken and it was very good. The place was packed on a weeknight when i was there and it took a long time before someone took by to go order but now i know to just call ahead. 

The menu is extensive and it looks like there are a lot of great choices but a lot of the cuisine sounded unfamiliar to me so next time I go I will bring a friend who knows a bit more about each dish so i can branch out from the basic americanized chinese dishes"}
{"text":"Having lived in Charlotte for over 8 years and being Chinese, I can say with some authority that Lee Cafe is hands down the most authentic Chinese food in Charlotte. From the moment I walked in, I could tell this is the real deal. All the customers seated at that time were Chinese and if you are looking for authentic food, then that's a telltale sign of a great place. As with any Chinese restaurant, all food is served family style so bring as many friends and/or family as you can rally! 

Food: I went with my mom and sister and since it was my first time there, we ordered an aggressive amount of food for a small family. Like champions, we basically ate everything it was so good. For appetizer, we started off with the Szechuan wontons (sorry I'm not sure of the exact translations of the foods) and it was amazing. The wonton was firm and filled with meat and shrimp and the chili oil was flavorful and reminded me of when I actually visited Szechuan. For the main dishes, we ordered Szechuan fish fillet, garlic eggplant, mapo tofu, and Beef chow fun (gan chao niu he). Every dish was flavorful, delicious and most importantly, very authentic. We loved spicy food so all our dishes were spicy, but they also have a large selection of non-spicy dishes. I would highly recommend what I ordered as they are very traditional Chinese dishes. 

All in all, I am excited to finally have a great authentic Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. 

Pro tip: Make sure to ask for the Chinese menu if you want the authentic dishes. Don't worry if you can't read Chinese, there is English translation on it."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Fort Mill! We eat here at least once a week and never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the eggplant and fish! Excellent and authentic Chinese food! I cannot eat spicy food but I was obsessed with their dishes! Good for group!!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE RUDE SERVICE! I ordered shrimp chow mein.  I am not Chinese but have been eating chow mein since I was a kid.  I got shrimp salad with a side of rice!  When I told the waitress, who was extremely rude from the moment we walked in, she insisted it was chow mein and they were going to charge me if I wanted actual chow mein noodles.  I asked to speak to someone else.  An older lady came by and was more rude than the waitress.  She argued that this was chow mein and I was wrong.  She said I would have to pay for the dish they gave me as well as a side of chow mein noodles.  She kept yelling and arguing that they serve American chow mein.  I proceeded to Google all types of chow mein and the description is: \"a Chinese-style dish of FRIED NOODLES with shredded meat or seafood and vegetables, not salad! They also never checked on our meal or refilled our drinks.   Even if I was wrong (which I was not) I AM THE CUSTOMER, GIVE ME A SIDE OF CHOW MEIN!  They would rather be right and lose future customers over a cheap meal than give me what I ordered. They also do NOT have sushi as advertised. A HORRIBLE restaurant experience and we will never be back."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite Asian restaurant.  The sushi is very fresh and well prepared.  The egg drop  soup is second to none, and the authentic menu is amazing especially the sizzling steak in black pepper sauce!  You must eat here."}
{"text":"Ordered here few times. Got great food and recommended to few people as well. But have to give 1 star for fallowing reason. Called today to order food and was placed on hold for almost 4 to 5 min which I can understand that they are busy. Once the lady came on she asked me for my order really with a rude attitude. I said my order and asked to make it spicy and she acted like I asked for gold and got more attitude. Then I asked I order egg fried rice and she said they only have small size but in a rude way. I asked her to make it spicy and she said they don't make that fresh it's pre-maid. I asked to make it fresh which any other Chinese spot would make it and she said no. I said to cancel my order which she didn't care for. I like to support local businesses but hate when a business gets cocky since they have great reviews and stops caring about customer service. Owner really needs to get this things right that service is also important as great food. I don't like to catch a attitude and bad service when I am paying them for food. That was my last time at this place."}
{"text":"For a quick Chinese place , this is pretty good. The problem is that the price and the atmosphere gives you more of a sit down Chinese restaurant. If You're looking for a quick lunch experience the prices are okay. Nothing really special in my opinion"}
{"text":"Good place for Sunday brunch. Only downside is the \"close quarters\" here. Eating at the bar may be a good alternative for those who are a bit claustrophobic. Food is delicious, had their omelet and mimosas! Friendly staff, hot food, and fast!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food! Got sushi there for the first time today me it was delicious. We got the Fish Dancer Roll and Super Spider Roll and they were both great, but the Super Spider was amazing and had a nice spice and crunch! Portions are huge so you can definitely share, my husband and I shared the Spicy Szechuan beef and didn't even finish half of it! The staff is super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Thanks to the staff at Lee Cafe for a great dining experience tonight! I came with about 12 other people and we all really enjoyed our meals as they were served up, on time and hot. We ordered a wide variety of dishes to share and all of them were delicious; from pork belly, to fish filet(yum) to sesame chicken! I had the spicy chicken and veggie entree and man was is good! The spice level was perfect and oh so tasty! I definitely recommend this place to anyone and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch specials. Had Sa Cha chicken with egg role and chicken wings. Wow!!! Amazing taste and flavors. 
Wife had hunan chicken with egg roles and she loved it. The egg fried rice that came as a side was awesome, rice perfectly cooked and not very oily. 
The price is the best part I would say ha ha. 6 bucks for the specials and a dollar extra for egg roles."}
{"text":"Authentic Szechuan.  Best I've had outside of Hong Kong and NYC.  Get the Hot and sour soup, Kung Pao Chicken (authentic style), and Szechuan wontons you won't be disappointed.  Don't be the fool!  Eat at Lee Cafe!!"}
{"text":"I am of Chinese heritages from Taiwan and have been in the US for 14 years living in Texas and Virginia. This is hands own the most authentic Chinese restaurant I have been to. 

I literally stuffed my face and had a tummy ache b/c I could not stop myself. It's hard to say what dishes are good because everything we ordered was amazing and so did all the dishes on other peoples table seem.

I still drool just thinking about the food there. I canst wait to go back on my next road trip down there."}
{"text":"The BEST chinese food. I'm originally from New York, so I could argue I know good chinese food. Lee Cafe honestly has the best chinese food. It is fresh, delicious, and low in sodium. My go-to is general tsos chicken, veggie lo mein, and won-ton soup. I sometimes order chicken lettuce wraps, beef and broccoli, orange chicken, and crab rangoon. It is all delicious. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been in Charlotte for over 4 years now and have had our share of chinese food in the area....by far this is our favorite place for authentic chinese food. A must have is the szechuan wontons, can't get enough of them."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of Szechuan & Cantonese. Service was wonderful, prices were great & food arrived very fast. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best Cantonese in Charlotte. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but you want to step inside. If you like your veggies you have to go for the snow pea tips. They rock it. Their Gen. Tsoa's amazeballs, a quote from the table. Sushi, slammin!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today. Food was good and I have no complaints there. Service was ok. Felt a little rushed. The check was brought out and I paid with cash. The ticket was around $40 and I left $45 total, Just shy of 15% tip. I paid with cash, left it on the table and walked out. I was then flagged down out side with the money and the ticket. I was asked if everything was ok. I responded, yes, and proceeded she proceeded to ask me why I didnt leave a larger tip.... Really????!!! I left just shy of 15% and I was chased down in the parking lot and asked why I didnt leave more... What a shame. I then told the lady that if she wasnt happy with the amount that I left, I would just want all my tip money back and wouldnt leave then anything. She, told me that was ok and walked off. 

I WILL NOT GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a party of 8 at Lee Cafe on a weekend and unfortunately when we arrived they weren't ready for us (causing us to wait 15-20 minutes for a table). This place is popular, but well deserved. Located in a grocery store shopping center, it's a hole-in-the-wall joint. The atmosphere, location, decor or even service won't draw you back, but the food will! Make sure you ask about their hot pot specials or additional evening specials. And check out the \"classic dishes\" portion of the menu. I highly recommend the Shanghai Cabbage, Double Cooked Pork and the Beef Chow Fun is delicious. The Szechuan Spicy Fish Fillet is good, but I thought the other dishes were much more flavorful while this was more for \"show\". I would say, it's hard to go wrong here, ask the servers for recommendations [or look at Yelp photos!]. The menu might be intimidating if you don't have experience with authentic cuisine, but just go for it--you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Literally the best Chinese food in the whole fort mill area!!  Their dishes are crazyyyy great and the portions are great for the cost."}
{"text":"As soon as they opened I been going there and the food was always good (I haven't tried their sushi yet), I love their traditional Chinese dishes that they offer in a completely different (not so secret) menu, they come in family size portion so don't get startled by the price, and if u really like traditional Chinese food u will know that u can hardly find anywhere that serves it or anyone who knows how to cook them but this place does a great job! I heard they changed the head chef about a year ago but the food quality remains the same so it didn't stop me from keep going back and get my regular does of authentic Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to do this because I don't want it to get any busier but I have to share this! I moved her from Boston two years ago and have been complaining about the lack of good Asian food. Well those days are over. This place is AUTHENTIC. I have been to China and for real this is awesome. The spicy Szechuan fish is amazing. Not nearly as spicy as I would expect from how it looks and the fish melts in your mouth. The Szechuan dumplings are amazing. Be prepared to wait because they get busy but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Ok, this review is based on 2 trips. I didnt want to leave a review based on only my 1st trip. I live near this restaurant and heard good things since they opened/took over the old Chinese restaurant. First time trying, I just ordered a couple staple classic dishes; beef lo-mein & mooshu pork. The lo mein was so bland, had absolutely no flavor. The beef was chewy and had a really weird texture & flavor. Ended up picking out the rest and throwing it away. The Moo Shu was better but very bland also. Had to actually use the soy sauce packets to add flavor. Decent portions. If I were to base my rating on this meal, I would've given 1 star.
There were alot of Chinese people eating there, and my friend that highly recommended them was Chinese as well. So I figured I would give them another chance, and this time order from the \"authentic Chinese\" menu I've been hearing about.
This time I ordered; Steamed Flounder with ginger & scallions, Mapo tofu with pork, and Snow Pea tips. 
1. The flounder was tiny and thin. Flavor was good, but it was $23! It was maybe worth $12 tops. Full of bones too.
2. The Mapo Tofu was really good, but you could barely tell there was any pork in it. Would order it again, but without pork to pay for this time. Great size portion.
3. The Snow Pea tips were awesome. No complaints, good size.
These 3 dishes cost me $50. Grrrrrrr...
But this order would get 3-4 stars. So I thought it would be fair to call it at 3 stars, to be kind."}
{"text":"Was OK.  Heard and read alot of hype around this place,  so much that drove 30 minutes to come try it.  Staff was friendly at first,  but after an 80 dollar dinner order was placed,  we asked for a bowl of crispy snacking noodles to take with us,  and the smallest bag was given and with 5 people eating we asked for a 2nd MINIATURE bag,  she says \" I gave you that bag,  I'll charge you 1.00 if you want more,  You Understand Me?\"  Disappointed with the tone and after any 80 dollar dinner order,  felt as if we're being charged for toothpicks.   All of this occurred after the bill was paid.   Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great sushi...cold beer... Great service. Don't let the outside fool you...give the place a try!"}
{"text":"When I start eating authentic Chinese food, I just want everyone to Lee me alone and let me enjoy it.

Lee Cafe has good Chinese dishes - but not amazing.

All in all, it's an excellent Chinese restaurant just inside the border of South Carolina in the Charlotte burbs, with pretty good Chinese stuff - much of it authentic.

The Mapo Tofu it was good but not amazing, whereas the Chongqing spicy chicken was more delicious - probably not spicy enough for me, and it did not have the numbing peppercorns from Szechuan region - but still very tasty.

Service was good and they served me late even though they were close to closing time, special commendations for that. Prices aren't bad, either, and nice hefty portions."}
{"text":"The most authentic Chinese place I've been to outside of Chinatown in NY. Had the spicy chili chicken and the garlic eggplant. That was my first time eating Szechuan peppercorns, so I wasn't expecting the tingling/numbing sensation that comes with them. Definitely a unique experience. I would like to go back and try more of the authentic Szechuan dishes and the sushi."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic szechaun place in Charlotte. I am actually very surprised this place exists since Charlotte does not have a large asian population at all but I am so happy they are  here! They provide lunch specials and the more American chinese takeout options but they also have a menu full of sze chuan specialties! 

We got the garlic eggplant, ganguo cauliflower and pork belly, and lazi chicken. Everything was good, their eggplant is on point, it was $9, cauliflower and pork belly was very good but was $20 so a little steep, and lazi chicken was actually my least favorite, about $9. Everything could have used more spiciness! I feel like they have been forced to tone it down because of the majority of the their clientele. 

Parking is shared with the Publix next to it. The owner was very nice and gave us a lot of recommendations."}
{"text":"Great place with awesome taste of real Chinese food! Highly recommended! If you are in the area and looking for Chinese restaurant you should try this place out."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!!!!  Sushi is top notch and the Chinese fare amazing.   You know is a good sign when you walk in and there are Chinese family eating traditional style."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise that we found Lee Cafe!  The super-friendly staff go out of their way to make you comfortable. The sushi is amazing; very fresh and delicious. The other food was equally great. We love it there and have been back many times and have never been disappointed. They have a true Chinese menu, as well as the \"Americanized\" version of Chinese food.  All has been very good."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Chinese food fan, but Lee Cafe does it really well. The fella and I have been a couple of times, but I didn't want to write a review the first time because we both ordered the wrong thing, and I didn't want to slight the restaurant. If you're a huge Chinese food fan, order off the authentic menu; if you're not, stick with the usuals. Lesson learned!

We arrived at 6 pm on a Wednesday night, and there was only one other couple eating in. We were promptly greeted and seated in a booth, and we got great service the whole night. A ton of people came in for take-out, and it was a little busier when we left, so I think we just got there earlier than most.

For dinner, I got the beef and broccoli. It was a generous portion, and the meat tasted fresh. The brown sauce wasn't too salty, which I appreciated, and the brown rice was about what you'd expect. The fella got the dinner combination chicken and shrimp with broccoli, which came with an egg roll, veggie roll, or crab rangoon, and he went with the egg roll. Dessert was either cake or fruit, and he went with fruit, which was three orange slices. Interesting.

Two dinners and two glasses of wine were $31 + tip. Not too shabby for solid food and good service!"}
{"text":"Had a dream last night about their chili chicken. When I get it for takeout, I eat the Sichuan peppers that are fried with it and get that extra flavor. 

Yes, I have a problem."}
{"text":"I always seem to try new Chinese restaurants via carryout when I'm famished, and I was totally impressed with Lee Cafe.  The menu looks amazing, with several different cuisine types, and the less intimidating Americanized Chinese foods that we all know and love. The hot & sour soup was dark, full of ingredients and the perfect consistency (I like mine on the spicy side, and this version delivers). The sushi sampler was amazing; each piece was expertly constructed and delicious. No sauces were needed for the sushi. The entrees we ordered from the lunch menu were superbly prepared, tender, with ample portions. My husband ordered five delicacies (I think that was the name of it) with added spice. Both the fried and white rice were wonderful as well. We forgot to order egg rolls... next time I'll remember them, for sure. So excited to have a great Chinese and sushi place less than two miles from my door step."}
{"text":"Hands down the best and most authentic Chinese food restaurant in the charlotte area. Give the Chinese menu a try. The appetizers are great. Especially the Sichuan cold cut chicken."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in Charlotte is in Fort Mill... This place's Chinese menu is mostly sechuan dishes, so generally all spicy. I have been a few times and it's best to go with a lot of people and eat family style. Food is pricey, but you pay for the premium of the style of cooking and the authenticity of flavors.

I recently went with some coworkers, everyone thought it was awesome. We ordered 10 dishes for 7 people and final bill was about $25 a person. Pricey, but worth it if you have a craving for authentic Chinese food in Charlotte... Plan on spending $20 for food and a $5 for a drink."}
{"text":"Great Asian restaurant! Very authentic, flavorful and tasty. The orders come out less than 10 mins, so the chefs are super quick! Not many great Asian restaurant near Charlotte, but Lee cafe for sure is one of the top Chinese restaurant. The table is clean, sever is nice, and food is awesome! Highly recommend others to try them out!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around.  Food is freshly made and always tastes amazing! 

We usually order from the \"Authentic Chinese\" menu, but even their \"American Chinese\" menu is better than others I've had."}
{"text":"Very good menu variety and the food definitely lives up to expectations.  A bit pricey which is fine however I couldn't substitute fried rice for an up charge on one of my meals because I didn't want white or brown and also the meals didn't include egg rolls or fortune cookies?  First time I've ever experienced that in an Asian restaurant... I'll definitely go back because the food is great and people who work there also were very friendly and hospitable."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! We've been looking for a good Chinese restaurant since we moved here 10 years ago and finally found the best! Their streamed chicken and veggies are out of this world! The streamed dumplings are the best! Unassuming Little restaurant that offers a lot!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the Carolinas!  Make sure to try some of the authentic dishes and don't get bogged down with Americanized Chinese food."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food, nice and clean. They have authentic Chinese food and \"American style Chinese food as well\". Their sushi are super good!!!"}
{"text":"Salt and spices fish is AMAZING. After eating here I've stepped my Asian food game up. Nothing else compares! Also my mom works with a lot of people from China and they drive all the way from pineville to eat here! Order off the Chinese menu!"}
{"text":"My dining mates and I ate here for dinner. Very extensive dinner menu featuring  regional choices for example of Cantonese, Szechuan dishes,plus combo dinner specials. Lunch menu also extensive. Sushi cuisine offered also.
 A small ipad on the table with photos of some of the dishes
Menu prices very reasonable.

The atmosphere was plain but comfortable. Our waitress very friendly and eager to explain the menu we had questions about.
Our dinners were plated nicely, good portions. Food was warm not hot.
Spicy dishes were not that spicy and we actually asked for a extra little dish of hot sauce for the food.

Everything we ordered was very tasty.
Our waitress made a few mistakes on our orders but quickly apologized and brought out the correct dishes.


We ordered, hot and sour soup, miso soup, lettuce wraps, salmon roll. Entrees were Hunan chicken, beef and scallops, sesame chicken, and spicy fish. Brown, white or fried rice choices with dinner.
All in all an enjoyable dinner. We would come back again for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Best authentic Szechuan Chinese food ever and it is right down the street from my fiancé's house! Now I have a reason to go see him lol"}
{"text":"This is our go to Chinese place.  We live close and they are fast. Orders ready and waiting for us to pick up in under 15 minutes.  

The staff is always smiling and very thorough.  They repeat your order to make sure it's correct.

To be honest we always order the \"Americanized\" dishes (sesame chicken, general tso, etc.) And they are slightly above average.  Not epic.

However they have a full Authentic Chinese food menu, and judging by the clientele, it must be very good.

Overall we love this place"}
{"text":"Looking for some authentic Chinese food? Lee Café may be the place for you, if you don't mind a short trip to Fort Mill.

One menu is all in Chinese and the other Chinese with English translation. That tells me that people who can read Chinese eat here. Which further tells me I'm in the right place for the \"good stuff\".

So far, my favorite dishes are the Szechuan Spicy Beef, Mapo Tofu and Twice Cooked Pork. The flavors were spot on and reminded me of places I frequented in NYC; the portions are also very generous. The Appetizer Section has cold items that you would not expect, like Saliva Chicken, that I was admittedly not brave enough to order. Of course they have hot appetizers and soup. There's a sushi bar, but why get sushi when there's so much else to order? 
 
So in the ongoing search for good Chinese in Charlotte, put this one on your \"to do \" list."}
{"text":"Nice staff.. clean environment.. great menu selection.. can't wait to go back for sushi"}
{"text":"Wow! Everything was so delicious! Although you can find the same dishes in other Chinese restaurants, you can taste the difference here. We got there and we saw Asian families also getting to the parking lot. From there you can tell i will be good. The hot and sour soup is probably one of the best I've ever had in my life. I want to go back and try the sushi rolls."}
{"text":"First time trying this place after reading all the reviews.   First stopped here on a Tuesday for lunch and it was closed.  The front window said open for lunch Monday through Thursday ok but then under it says closed Tuesday,  no problem, so we came yesterday and it was worth it.  We were greeted as soon as we stepped inside.  It was very cozy with nice tables with high back chairs and also several large sized booths.  They give you two menus for lunch one the usual and the other for sushi.  Nice selection. I ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce and my better half ordered chicken with cashews.  Both were very good in presentation and taste.  The service is very quick and thorough.   The food turnout is quick.  We truly enjoyed the meal and were surprised at the bill, $12 for both.  I now see why the reviews are all very good.  We will definitely be back  again."}
{"text":"We were traveling through on New Year's Day, heading back from a family visit and arrived 15 minutes before they officially closed. They had already started cleaning up and had no other customers there, but still let us in (thank you!). I saw a review mention hot pot and was excited at the possibility of having good authentic Chinese food (something I haven't had since I lived in Boston) and was not disappointed! I got the seafood clay pot and my person got the Sichuan beef. When they brought it out, our eyes got huge at the portions. We thought \"we didn't bring enough people for this much food!\" We stated eating, and shocked ourselves by finishing everything. Both were incredible, but I wound up stealing his. The Sichuan beef left an awesome tingle all over my mouth and the service was incredible. Thank you again for staying open late for us!"}
{"text":"Four stars because I think it might be the only authentic Chinese place I've found close to Charlotte so far. The prices are a little higher if you want the real Chinese dishes, but overall it was pretty good, though too salty. The spicy steamed fish soup was amazing and definitely as authentic as it gets."}
{"text":"I'm originally from So California and live in Charlotte for the past 24 years and this is the best Chinese cuisine Charlotte has to offer in my opinion. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Food was hot and flavorful without being too salty. Our waitress explained any questions we asked about their menu. A completely satisfying experience both with our meals and service."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Chinese food...here you have it.  The sesame chicken & egg fried rice is awesome...and I'm picky when it comes to rice! Nice staff, great prices!"}
{"text":"All the reviews about this place was not what I expected.  Tried their famous fish dish and it was just drenched in oil with no flavor what so ever.  Other dishes were okay but was very disappointed in the dishes people had recommended.  Service was great."}
{"text":"I went to this place with high expectation with all high rates reviews. However, I was disappointed. As a real Chinese, I should say lee only deserves a three stars. We ordered three dishes, beef cold cut, spicy fish filet and spicy chili chicken. I should say spicy chili chili chicken was awesome even compared the ones I have in China. But, the other two dishes were bad. The beef tasted weird and I don't know if it was because it was not fresh or they use some special flavor. The spicy fish filet came with lots of red pepper but it was not spicy at all!!! And not even smells good..... It is probably good for an American who wants to have a taste of real Chinese food, not the 'orange chicken', but I don't recommend it to people who want real ????finally, just a tip, you may need to make a reservation with them if over 2 people, this place is packed!"}
{"text":"I am so happy Lee Cafe decided to plant its roots here because it is close to my home.  I have been here about 12 times and I have always had a great experience with attentive staff and the food quality is rather good.  
For the price, you get plenty of food and it taste great too!  The proof is in the waiting area as many others agree this is a good place too eat so be mindful and stop running your mouth and let others sit and eat too.  
If it is Friday or Saturday night, call ahead for to-go orders and plan to wait a little while to be seated if dining in.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent chinese food. whole steam flounder and stir fry snow pea tips are worth the trip.  Also the eggplant .  It was all good. I will go back soon."}
{"text":"Yep, this is quite authentic Chinese food but the Americanized looks fine too. The only thing that would have made this better would have been eating with someone and being able to share and try some more food.

I chose the Spicy Chicken with Chilis and yes, it was a little spicy but if you stayed away from the peppers, it was really just a lot of flavor and texture. Do people really eat those hot chili peppers? They just seem dry to me. Plenty of chicken and it was tasty.

Service was good and the food was excellent. I'll need to meet up with some of you Yelpers here so we can get a few things for the table and SHARE!

(My 100th review of 2018!)"}
{"text":"Came here after all of the great reviews.    On balance this place is good, but not great. 
The positives:
-  Service.  My server was very helpful and very attentive.  Checked back frequently but not too much.  Excellent 
-- Food was served piping hot.   It looked fresh as well.   
-  love that they have brown rice as an option.  Not everyone does.   It was delicious.  
-- Steamed veggies were really good.  Fresh broccoli, carrots, zukes, pea pods, mushrooms, nappa cabbage.  All steamed perfectly.   Definitely a highlight.  

The not as good:
-- I had the kung pao chicken.   While the flavor was good, some of the chicken was a little fatty which was weird since I was told it was all white meat.   I stopped eating it and focused on the peanuts and cashews only.  
-- they don't have sushi!   It's in the name, yet they didn't have sushi so if you are looking for that, find another restaurant.  

I'd be back for sure, but wasn't blown away and would probably not order a chicken dish again."}
{"text":"New place in town, tried with a bunch of friends. Good taste overall, friendly services. But the portion is kinda small if you have 6-7 friends together the dishes will be finished like in a second. Not very authentic Sichuan or Hunan flavor though."}
{"text":"I would say this is the best Chinese food you'll eat anywhere in the Charlotte area. As mentioned in earlier reviews the food is authentic Cantonese. One of the few Chinese places you can take your vegetarian friends, they have a variety of vegetarian dishes. I personally love the twice cooked pork and dumplings."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my 14 y/o son.
My son rated his General Tsos chicken a 5 out of 5, and I also gave my Sha Cha Chicken a 5/5.  Servings were a perfect size for a lunch.  I was very impressed with the renovated interior...very well done!  Would definitely recommend!!  We will return to try more items on their extensive menu.  Regarding folks who claim staff is rude, keep in mind they are speaking English as a second language.  Their English is way better than my Mandarin/Chinese.  I spent a year in Asia, and yes, sometimes their English can come across as quite curt.  But, again, better than my Mandarin/ Chinese."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday after reading the article in the Observer.  

Unfortunately it was not a good experience.  My wife (vegetarian) asked the waitress if the spring roll and egg fried rice contained meat, to which the the waitress said no.  Then my wife asked what was in the Mopu Tofu.  Spicy tofu was the answer.  The entire time it appeared we were just a speed bump in the waitresses day. 

Well, turns out there's pork in it.  We sent it back and they remade it - but it tasted so heavily of pork my wife couldn't eat it.  It actually churned her stomach.  I tried it, enjoying many types of food, it was definitely pork. 

Our waitress never came back by so I stopped another, she kept trying to get us another plate of something even though I kept explaining she can't eat anything now. 

It appeared we weren't the only customers with an issue with this waitress and it's a really small place!

The egg fried rice was pretty plain and my hot and sour soup has a large chunk of undisolved spice.   My general tso chicken was well cooked and had he right amount of spice, but a little heavy on the sweetness and breading. 

Oh well."}
{"text":"This place gives me hope for more places like it.  Its not in \"Charlotte\", but Fort Mill is a stones throw away and it's super easy to get to without any traffic.  Definitely worth venturing out of the city limits to experience some authentic Chinese dishes.  The do have the americanized dishes on their menu too if that is what you fancy, but it is definitely great to have the options.

All the yelp photos helped us tremendously as well as our server, whom patiently recommended dishes once we bombarded her with questions.

We over-ordered of course, but that means we had leftovers available for later (and we got to try a lot of things in one sitting).  The szchenuan wontons were amazing... (hopefully you are a fan of spicy since this place does have a lot of options with all things pepper on them).  The twice cooked pork was awesome as well.  Make sure to ask your server about their season items like the veggies and their specials!

Overall, it was located in a strip mall but had a ton of tables... seemed like there were a lot of people and some reserved booths for the regulars.  The space had either just been remodeled and kept neat and tidy.... almost a 50's soda shop type feel inside.  Regardless of the decor, the food definitely was the star... and I had to almost roll myself out the door like Violet Beauregard in the chocolate factory."}
{"text":"I've been to Lee Cafe twice. The first time was just for lunch and I ordered off of their regular combo menu. The garlic chicken was very good and the sauce was light and did not seem to contain tons of corn starch like most Chinese places. 

On my latest visit for dinner with my dinner group, we ordered a bit of everything from the traditional menu.  For appetizers the Szechuan Wontons were amazing! I couldn't get enough of the sauce. The tempura shrimp was also good as well as the steamed dumplings.

For entrees we shared the chili chicken, Szechuan beef, salt and pepper tofu, a pork dish and a triple protein dish whose names I cannot remember. The highlight for me was the chili chicken. It can smothered in chilies but the sliced ginger is what made it phenomenal.  The tofu was the surprise! It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

The staff here is amazing, very friendly and spot on service wise.  Prices are very affordable for huge portions.

This has now become my favorite Chinese restaurant I the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"The lady below who said she can get $2.50 per sushi roll, I want to know where and if she got food poisoning.

Anyway, in all seriousness, I tried this place last night on new year's eve. They were packed. Around 13 tables inside, and a sushi bar. The sushi bar chef is actually Japanese, and his wife works as a waitress. On a any given day they have 4 waitresses, but last night, they were so busy I think I saw 5 or 6. There are 13 tables inside the restaurant. spacious and clean bathrooms. 

Ordered off their Chinese menu (At the back of the regular menu):
1. Egg noodle stir fried with soy sauce $9.50. Pretty big portion. Nothing too spectacular but definitely tasty, sesame, onion stir fried egg noodle in soy sauce. 
2. seafood tofu clay pot $16. Very good, but SUPER salty! I did not have enough rice to finish this dish because the salt content was so heavy. The seafood was generous portion and the tofu is not the fresh type but the tofu puff type, which I like. Great sauce, but again, too salty.
All the waitresses here work together, you will not have the same waitress who took your order to bring out your food. A different waitress brought out our food and she mistakenly took our sea food clay pot to the table next to ours. She of course sincerely apologized, but I thought the logistics could have been worked out better.
3. Chinese broccoli in garlic sauce $10. This I thought was kind of overpriced, I mean I guess so is the seafood tofu clay pot if you were really getting down to the nitty gritty. The Chinese broccoli were cut up to smaller pieces so it's easier to eat, it was very tasty, but there weren't that much on the plate. Any non-noodle dishes that are not appetizers come with 1 small cup of rice, you get a choice of 1. egg fried rice, 2. white rice or 3. brown rice.

Service was very friendly and perky, definitely way superior than typical Chinese or Asian joints. Nothing sketchy here. They don't try to scam you, or do things that make you question why they did certain things. The whole experience was very comfortable. Lighting was great, seats were nice and so is the dining table. Overall nice ambiance. 

I don't know many restaurants in Charlotte where you can order such authentic Chinese dishes, oh I was told the head chef here is from HK. However, this is the only authentic Chinese cuisine in Charlotte area I am able to locate that actually has good service and great ambiance."}
{"text":"The search for authentic Chinese in Greater Charlotte is over! Savory seasonings, fresh sushi, perfectly cooked dishes. We tried the spicy Szechuan beef, egg drop soup, general tso's chicken and a crispy California roll."}
{"text":"You'll NEVER have a better Mapo Tofu at any restaurant anywhere!  Plenty of spice and lots of yummy!  And of course there are so many other delicious dishes for the less adventurous or the more carnivorous (I'm not vegetarian; I just love my Mapo Tofu!)  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food was good! It was my first time visiting because I was heading to a housewarming and I happened to stop by a grocery store near by. I went in and began to ask questions about some things on their menu however, the patience level of the person assisting must have been low because she said, \" come on it's only $7.95\". I expressed that I was trying to get clarity on what she said because I didn't really understand her and after that I was just ready to grab my food and go! Even with good food, I would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"Rude and disrespectful owner.  Our order was Not correct even after it was repeated twice (owner had attitude after we asked her to repeat).  When we picked up we mentioned to her the way she spoke on he phone (she said she had to answer phones and turned her back to us).  We were shocked! Once home we discovered our order was not correct - we called and was passed on to someone else that was unconcerned and hung up."}
{"text":"One of the more top-notch Chinese/Asian cuisine restaurants in the area. I've only been in here for lunch but wouldn't be opposed to coming by for dinner some time. There's something different about this Chinese place compared to so, so many others camped out in Food Lion shopping centers throughout the South.

So many of those other places often feel so gimmicky. Cheap meals with a front of being authentic Chinese. While I've only had the lunches here so far (which fit firmly into the \"standard American Chinese food\" category) I get the feeling that they're legit here. They're not actually strictly staffed by Chinese people. Oddly enough, that's indicator number one that they might be authentic.

Anyways, staff here has always been super nice and helpful. Easily among the friendliest staff I've met at a Chinese restaurant. They actually take time to talk to you and get to know you. They sport mini iPads for taking orders and I'm sure that enables them to get to tables quickly without having to run orders back to the kitchen constantly. I've never met with a delay on receiving my food here.

The food flavor and quality isn't anything to write home about. Again, basing this entirely on the lunch menu right now. I'd really like to take a shot at some more authentic stuff. I've had the sesame chicken and it's honestly a bit plain. But this won't stop me from going back in again for lunch. They move quickly and you can get full and pay tip for $8. See y'all again soon!"}
{"text":"Great Restaurant! Awesome service! Tastey Food!

Now about the experience.. 50s diner like feel with the decor. The restaurant is clean and that's what really matters when you sit down to eat.

Negatives:
I am not a fan of the schezuan wontons. Everyone else said they were amazing however there is a taste of seasonings that did not go well with my palette. No one's fault, just not a fan.

Positives:

From my sushi roll to the peppered steak, everything was superb. As everyone else has commented, I walked out with my tummy completely full. I am thoroughly impressed and will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"We hit the Chinese food restaurant jackpot!  This place is located in a shopping center, very unassuming and \"in the cut\" but boy oh boy, after your 1st visit, you won't have any trouble finding it...just lead with your stomach!  

I have been fortunate enough to have \"Jenny\" as my server on both visits. The visual menu on a tablet is extremely helpful but Jenny's clear explanation of the dishes was even better!  She encouraged us to go outside of our comfort zone and not order \"typical Chinese food\".  So yeah, there's like an entirely different menu for the more traditional Chinese dishes...don't be scuurd, you'll only be disappointed if you don't give it a shot! :)

We ordered the Szechuan Wontons...OMG...soooooo good!  They are pretty spicy so beware if you're sensitive to spicy and bold flavors. The lettuce wraps were also very good!  Servings are made for sharing so keep that in mind if you go solo."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and grabbed take out once. I would recommend it. It's in a plaza with Food Lion so there's not much atmosphere but the food is delicious. I've ordered from the traditional and American sides of the menu and everything we have tried was good enough to order again. I've tried the Dumplings in Chili Oil, Dry Fried Green Beans with Pork, Fried Chili Chicken, Mongolian Chicken and Chicken with Garlic Sauce. The price point for lunch is outrageously affordable. The service is very pleasant and attentive. I would come back again."}
{"text":"This is probably the best authentic chinese restaurant in the Charlotte area. I got the sweet and sour pork and the eggplants with garlic sauce. They are absolutely delicious. The pork is crunchy on the outside, and so moist and tender in the inside. The eggplants are seasoned perfectly. They are not too garlicky and have the right amount of spiciness. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Love Lee Cafe!!! It is even better when they are serving sushi! Great sushi and great Chinese food! You really cannot beat their lunch specials."}
{"text":"Wow!  Excellent sushi!  I'm a tough critic and don't give many 5 star ratings but this place has it figured out.  Sushi was very fresh, excellent presentation.  I also had a salad and it was very good as well."}
{"text":"A new restaurant in Fort Mill, had to check it out. On a 'date nite' with Mrs. Reviewer we enjoyed but felt something was lacking. Her cashew chicken and fried rice were both over-salty. I liked my meal better (a spicy shrimp) but the white rice was sticky. Entree sizes were average at best. We have heard great things and will give them another try, perhaps with the traditional Chinese menu rather than the more Americanized combination platters."}
{"text":"Second time I have had take out from Lee Cafe and it is delicious! I order from their traditional menu, costs a little more but the variety and freshness are so worth it. Like no other Chinese restaurant I have eaten at before."}
{"text":"Tried carryout, the hot and sour soup is pretty good it has a nice amount of heat and is very flavorful.  My husband had the egg drop soup and like it as well.  Hibachi chicken was a bit bland and didn't come with any sauces.  My h tried the pepper steak, wasn't too thrilled.  We also had egg rolls and those were bland, no sauce provided.  I would try this place again, but a reminder if you get carryout make sure you request sauces."}
{"text":"Excellent food, one of the best Chinese places in Charlotte.  Don't let the shopping plaza fool you into thinking it's a typical greasy spoon hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Don't get wrong by the name it's an awesome Chinese restaurant, mainly spicy food. But as some cooks are from HK and to suit the locals' tastes, they cartered the cuisines so food is not that chilly. Most of the food are pretty authentic and it's really hard to find such a good Chinese restaurant in NC"}
{"text":"Try the Salty Fish & Chicken with Egg Plant Clay Pot.  Stir Fry Snow Pea Tips are yummy as well."}
{"text":"Lee Cafe is a hidden gem. Some of the best Chinese food in the Carolinas. It is so worth seeking this restaurant out.   It's just across the NC SC border in South Carolina. The waitstaff has always been wonderful. Everything that we have had here has been fantastic. You won't regret it. As I write this I realize that it is time for another visit and I can't wait."}
{"text":"We went during Chinese New Year, so the restaurant was very crowded.  We still received excellent service and a delicious meal.  Very pleasant dining experience with a lot of unique, authentic menu items."}
{"text":"Having seen all the raving reviews wife and I decided to visit last night for dinner.  Expecting to wait a little bit even on weekday evening, we were surprised that no wait at all.  Actually only 3 or 4 tables were occupied.  Nonetheless we were happy not having to wait.  We studied the two sets of menu, Cantonese and Sichuan (no sushi on Tuesday) and settled on 3 dishes, all fairly authentic Chinese.  The waitress was very helpful and friendly.  
The duck dish came first since it is a cold (room temperature) dish.  Duck was brined in salt and spice liquid then steamed and let cool down before serving.  Portion is good, so is the flavor.  Second dish was a spicy dish with battered and fried fish fillet pan fried with cilantro and red hot chili pepper in just a little bit of oil.  Fish is fresh and flaky but the batter is a little chewy.  We have had better, but it still gets a passing grade from us.  The last dish was deep fried tofu with sautéed vegetables.  The dish had to be prepared only upon ordering so it took the longest, we were told.  Tofu was a little crispy on the outside and hot and soft on the inside; exactly the way it should be.  The vegetables were not overcooked and still had some crunchiness.  The sauce was also pretty good which gives flavor to the tofu.  We were pleasantly surprised at the end, not so much by the quality, or selection, of the dishes, but by the fact  restaurants such as this serving fairly authentic Chinese food actually exist and even thrive around Charlotte.  We were also told that the restaurant has not 1 or 2, but 4 chefs, including a Japanese sushi chef.  It is difficult to fathom how busy the place has to be on the weekend to support the large staff.  Wish the best to the owner and the staff."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant around PERIOD.

Ask for the authentic Chinese menu. This place is new and has been updating their menu quite often. The flavor is overall pretty authentic."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place, as the name might suggest, and we were okay with that.

Upon arrival, a sign says, \"Please wait to be seated.\" So we waited, and waited, and finally we were acknowledged and seated. We noticed a lot of other Asians in the cafe, which we felt was a good sign (since same ethnicity usually means authentic and quality). It took another 10 minutes for anyone to come by and ask us what we wanted, or give us some water. One of the servers was practically running from table to table, while the others just seemed to take their time. 

Our server finally arrives and apologizes as it was a \"food rush\" (okay, 1:30pm is not exactly \"lunch time\"). Firstly, there are too many menus. We were given 3 menus to choose from (lunch specials, specials, regular menu). Food arrives in separate deliveries (lunch orders should arrive together; this is not a-la-carte). The sweet-and-sour soup was good, not too spicy. The wonton soup lacked flavor. One of the menus seemed to list authentic \"home town cooking\" (if you like sheep intestines). 

Food was okay overall, definitely not a '5' as many have raved. Sub-standard service brings this rating down from a would-be \"4\". Bad experience, won't return."}
{"text":"The authentic chinese, szechuan, and Cantonese food here is amazing. The cooks here know what they are doing and I'm glad I found this spot. 

Based on feedback from coworkers the standard Chinese American dishes are above average as well , the service is super friendly, fast, and the plates are the perfect size . The prices match the pleasure your tummy will recieve with every bite and it's more than enough to share . 

Try the salt and pepper porkchops if you are a pork fan. The snowpea tips were scrumptious as well. Our second time visiting the snowpea tips were not in matket so they had the fresh veggie of the day as a substitute . Love a prepared chef! I'm going back to try 90%of the menu."}
{"text":"Love Lee Cafe! They are so authentic and include an iPad full of photos of almost everything on the menu. The dumplings are so good!!"}
{"text":"*****AUTHENTIC CHINESE FOOD*****

So happy to say there is finally a great Chinese restaurant near Charlotte! It is located right near Carowinds (same exit). 

Menu has a good variety of different Chinese foods- esp. different styles. Portion size is decent, but the best part is that the food came so fast even when it was fairly busy! 

Random tidbits:
1. I love twice cooked pork but this one was more fatty than usual. If that's what you like, then go for it! 
2. Please try the drunken chicken, it was so tender and delicious! 
3. It seems like it can get busy fast due to limited seating, so it would be safe to make a reservation. 
4. Servers seem to really care about the needs of the customers, even if it's like getting me a water in a timely manner. 

Can't wait to come back and try other dishes on the menu!"}
{"text":"Living on the West Coast, you'd think I would have good access to Chinese. That's not the case. So when I decided to cross state number 27 off my list, I crossed the South Carolina border and headed to Lee Cafe for lunch with a friend.

The lunch special is a good deal. Not the most amazing Chinese food I've ever had, but the best in a while. And the price was right.

My only complaint was that the server was chewing gum. Yuck. I was a server for a while and that was a fireable offense. Apparently not here."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Had to wait since they were packed and people just kept on coming in but the staff was working as fast as they could and it wasn't too long of a wait at all! Food was fabulous off of the authentic menu and it arrived quickly at our table! Waitresses were all very pleasant. Also the wine pour was nice and generous! Definitely recommend and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Finally found excellent Chinese food in Charlotte!  We stopped in tonight for dinner at about 6pm, by 6:30 there was already a long wait for tables - and for good reason, this place is legit! They have all your standard \"Americanized\" dishes but also have sections of the menu serving Cantonese and Szechuan specialities. We stuck to the Szechuan side and ordered the wantons, beef tendon and spicy Szechuan beef. Everything was great with the wantons being my favorite! That sauce on them!! Will be coming back for all of my future Chinese cravings!"}
{"text":"Nope. I have no idea why this place got such a high rating. You all must be used to subpar food. We went in for takeout and after they forgot to put our order in, we finally got our food. We both got dinner combo, one with beef and broccoli, and the other with shrimp. The fried rice that came with it had no flavor, nothing but rice,  just looks brown. The shrimp were tiny and tastelsss. Beef and brocolli was alright, nothing special. We didn't get any duck sauce at  all. Fried noodles were in a tiny bag and tasted like they were fried in old oil. Back in Charlotte, Ma Ma Wok rocked. Everything was always fresh and hot and flavorful. If you go here, you are SUM DUM FUK."}
{"text":"I know that comparing Charlotte (technically Fort Mill) Chinese food to New York is a little unfair. There are just more Cantonese people up there so the options are endless but after eating at Lee Cafe I will no longer need to wait until my trips up north to get good Cantonese/Szechuan style dinner. 

My suggestion is to go in a larger group so you can order entrees and do it family style. If you have never had Szechuan before, Most dishes come out with a ton of Szechuan peppercorn but they are thicker and harder to chew so if you don't want it spicy they are easily avoidable.

When we sat down, we got a ton of menus. We got a sushi menu, a Chinese menu, and a regular menu. I strongly think you should go out of your comfort food when you try this place. There are not a lot of places in the area that have authentic dishes. So if you see a dish that you could get in a food court in the mall, try something else! Not because it wouldn't be good at Lee Cafe but because your taste buds will be in for a treat! 

The Szechuan Wonton
(Which was pork and had pieces of whole shrimp, not minced) were delightful. The best part was the sauce the wontons were in. Super flavorful!!! We loved it so much in fact after we finished the wontons we saved the plate of sauce to pour over our white rice. 

Dry-fried Green Beans 
Hands down! The best garlic green beans I have ever had. I don't know what dry fried means but the green beans were bright and plump and had a crisp bite to them but were not oily. They came out with a ton of garlic and everyone at the tables loved them!!

We also got the Beef Chow Fun which is a guilty pleasure for me, I personally always love any kind of fat noodle so it's really hard for me to review this because I'm biased. But guys at the table after the fact said we should have opted for a more traditional dish.  We also got the Spicy Chili Chicken which is also dry fried. It was a little tough for me but still tasted good. 

So long story short, I will be coming back. There are SOO many things I want to try like MAPO tofu, the sushi here and basically all the things that say Szechuan in front of it! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service; they even provide a visual menu to help the explorers. Prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food that they provide. Just overall great experience."}
{"text":"My family and I recently moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to Columbia, SC. We love it here in the South, but we have discovered that really good Chinese restaurants in the Midlands are rare. Since we are only an hour away from Charlotte, NC, I decided to research Sichuan (aka Szechuan) restaurants in Charlotte. Through Yelp! we came across Lee Cafe in Fort Mill, SC, a suburb that is south of Charlotte across the state border. My wife and I decided to try it this past Easter Sunday. We ordered the Szechuan wontons, the spicy Szechuan chicken (aka Chongqing spicy chicken), twice cooked pork, and spicy eggplant. We were treated to some wonderfully prepared dishes complete with tongue-numbing Sichuan peppercorns and dried chilis. My wife and I agreed that the food here could stand up to the authentic Sichuan cuisine we enjoyed in California for so many years. It was so good, in fact, that we went back the next weekend when we picked up our son at the Charlotte airport. This time, we tried the Ma Po Tofu and Taiwanese cabbage along with the Szechuan wontons and spicy Szechuan chicken. Yes, this was definitely more food than two people could consume, but we planned to have plenty extra to bring back home to savor. I cannot speak to their sushi or more traditional Chinese-American dishes, but their Sichuan dishes are definitely on-point."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch date. The atmosphere is traditional Asian cuisine. Not busy at all for lunch time but it was a late lunch around 1-2pm. I got the shrimp lo mein spicy with egg fried rice. The fried rice didn't have any veggies in it, just brown rice and egg so that threw me off. The lo mein was decent but nothing to write home about and not spicy at all. Overall, it was an okay quick meal. Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Let's forget about the fact that it's had a \"Grand Opening\" sign up for like 4 months.

This place has a GREAT menu. Super perky service, and clientel that are legit Asian. You'll sit down for lunch and hear a mix of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean abounding in this place. I can't understand how they can maintain such a big menu and keep the quality and quantity of food consistent.

They have: The lunch combination menu. The lunch special menu. The sushi menu. The real Chinese combination menu. The real Chinese special menu. And I haven't even been there for dinner! Just ask for the real Chinese menu, they'll happily provide it and explain to you what everything is. They have a killer Hot Pot and Mapo Tofu, both dishes that are native to China.

For the americanized lunch combos, they will add a soft drink and dessert to your order! I get cake every time because why not. 
If I'm ever feeling in the mood for asian food, this place delivers fast, reliable service, and the food is excellent to match, every time! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Knowing what to order here makes all of the difference!  Really tasty sweet and sour pork chop, snow pea tips, and oyster with tofu hot pot...great combination."}
{"text":"Very courteous and attentive staff. Food is amazing. Good portions, and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Truly an 'Ahhh' moment! I've been on a mission to find a decent Chinese take out restaurant on my side of town for YEARS! I have to admit I'm pretty picky when it comes to Asian food; being half Asian nothing is as good as mom makes. Lee's Cafe filled that void. I love this place..fast, not greasy, authentic dishes and great price can't beat that.

We got General Tso' chicken and Mongolian beef. It was a sizable portion for the price. Chicken was crispy and sweet. I'm determined to try their sushi on the next visit."}
{"text":"So good!!!!!! If you are looking for real authentic Chinese and Japanese food by Chinese and Japanese staff look no further :-) Ask for Chinese menu they will explain anything you are unsure of. Really nice place with great service.  sushi is excellent too"}
{"text":"What a joke! I asked for extra Hunan sauce on the side and was asked to pay 2.50. If the food had any flavor, I wouldn't need it! Stay away!"}
{"text":"This place is a local favorite.  Love their lunch special.  It's my mom's favorite place and very reasonablu priced."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant when they had their grand opening since I wanted to try their sushi. The staff were nice and the wait wasn't too bad. I ordered the wonton soup (I thought the serving would be bigger but it was really small, however it was very good), buffalo wings (they were okay, not anything special), and California roll (sushi was pretty good, not the best but pretty decent). Overall it's a very good restaurant and I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Probably the most authentic Chinese restaurant in the entire charlotte area. Get their authentic Chinese menu. Service is great and price is reasonable. It is now our go-to place when it comes to authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Amazing food this is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant there's so many options I recommend the chicken lo mien amazing"}
{"text":"We've been here already twice, and love this place for their authenticity and lunch menu prices!. 

I grew up in Japan, so I really care about the authenticity. I went to a Japanese grocery store in Charlotte and they told me that Lee cafe has a Japanese sushi chef!!

The chef's rolls are authentic Japanese, of course, absolutely delicious!

By the way, even waitresses are Japanese ;) feel like at home!"}
{"text":"We just got to go. The sesame chicken was really overcooked, I couldn't even finish it. Would not recommend."}
