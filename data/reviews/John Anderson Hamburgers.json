{"text":"What I'd give to have the old John Anderson's on Yonge Street back, with Vic and his great crew!  This particular location, on the border with Scarborough, is one of the last remnants of a once popular dining destination. It is small, has limited seating, and is mostly geared toward take-out orders.  I passed by one day, and having had so many great memories from my youth of the old location on Yonge Street, I decided to give it a try.  What a mistake!  Feeling extra hungry, I ordered a Banquet Burger with Fries, Onion Rings and a Coke. A simple order that not only took 15 minutes to complete but that they somehow got wrong.   After actually having paid for the meal (and while I was waiting for my order) the staff told me they made a mistake and had me pay extra for the bacon on the burger. Not sure how they messed up one of their signature dishes, but they did.  Trying to explain to them that they were the ones that bore the onus for their own mistake turned out to be fruitless. Apparently, they think that the customer should bear the brunt of their ineptitude. By this point, I was too hungry to continue arguing and paid for my order.  The food was nothing special and definitely not worth the price (even before their little \"incompetence-surcharge\").  It's quite sad how low this franchise has sunk since its heyday. This used to be my go-to place after a great night on the town. Now, it's nothing more than a two-bit, hole-in-the-wall that offers overpriced, sub-par food. Oh, and a big serving of incompetence - but be ready to pay for that last one.  Time to let this place go extinct. Good Riddance!"}
{"text":"Fast food without any apologies. Yes it's greasy. Yes it's over the recommended sodium intake. But it tastes gooood.  Spicy fries with gravy. Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"We came here for a change of the usuals and for the fact that it came up as a place for greek take as well. It appears that it never escaped the late 70's/early 80's, decor and all! I'm more than old enough to not only remember who John Anderson was, but also watched him on the ice. He was also a very charitable person in regards to helping others. But if he new what has happened here, over time, he would be very disappointed! My wife ordered the steak on a bun with fries and gravy and was very please with how for the most part the steak turned out. I ordered the gyros dinner with a side of onion rings. The meat was not only dryer than a fart in a bottle, but you could tell that it was crazy/thinly sliced donair meat from a box. As for the rice, salad and the onion rings they made up for the disappointment of what the meal's about. The price was reasonable, however we can say we've tried the place and will leave the recommendation of the place to those who wish to try something different, but don't expect anything out of the ordinary! Too bad!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for over 20 years and this place has become terrible since John Anderson sold it to the new owner a few years back. The burger patties have gotten thinner as well as the portions for all the options I've tried recently. The cheeseburger I ordered was a joke for almost $5. The prices have steadily gone up with little justification as the food is now terrible. Won't be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Went in about a month ago with my sister. Blast from the past as We ate there frequently growing up.  The decor is the exact same the food is horrible.  Ordered a souvlaki and fries (to share). We were the only people in there and it took 25 min. The place is so dirty, I was almost afraid to eat the food. I should not have. It was disgusting.  Should have been a clue that we were the only ones in there"}
{"text":"No signage and off the main street, so you won't see it unless looking for it. Typical John Anderson's, good burgers and souvlaki at good prices."}
{"text":"This burger joint located up the street from the local favorite Johnnie's Burger (another review to follow).  It appears this place used to be run by Greeks ( or Mediterranean area) for their souvlaki and other tell tale menu items.  I ordered the home burger with fries as they say it is made fresh where the others are commercial patties.  They cook their burgers a little more than my liking and the fries are the country style chunky fries ( sorry McDonalds lovers).  The burger is OK but with the other institution down the street they rely on a lot of foot traffic from the locals and schools."}
