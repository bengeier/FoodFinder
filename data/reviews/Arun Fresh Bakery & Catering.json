{"text":"Excellent food & service, try their kottu roti with either chicken or mutton. Their Buryani is not bad either."}
{"text":"Tasty food, nice service, fast. Nice family business. Try their many Sri Lankan delicacies."}
{"text":"This is a great family run Sri Lankan restaurant. Primarily take out but there are a few tables. The food is fresh, spicy but not overly so and reasonably priced. I have been here many times for take out and it is the best of few options in the area. My favourites include the rotis, the mutton devil, the channa curry and the leeks."}
{"text":"I bought mutton kottu rotti on Sunday April 2,2017 one of the worst kotthu rotti i ever eat,too oily,very very small portion compare to other sriliankan restaurants but same price????, no flavor at all ,taste like they boiled the mutton in the hot water.too dry no gravy at all,taste like old food. we never visit this place again,one of the worst srilankan restaurent in town,  you want to waste your money go there and try the food if you try their food,you will remember my review is 100% true  if they continue do like this,will close very soon/"}
