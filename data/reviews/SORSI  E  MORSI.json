{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise. Had no expectations going in. The food was terrific, (I had the Risotto with Shrimp) the staff super friendly. Be sure to try the Cheesecake for dessert."}
{"text":"So we were the only group under 50 (or likely 65 on closer observation) and while there's nothing wrong with that, I can only surmise these rave reviews are from the monied Kingsway set who like their veggies and pasta like mush, and their proteins blah. This place is outrageously overpriced for a neighborhood joint. No AC on a 30C day, we were all sweating buckets.  My $40 fish plate had mushy cut up veggies that had to be frozen (ie. I've never seen green beans cut like that except in hospitals and the frozen food section). It's also the first time I've had carrots which tasted sour, since carrots last forever I got to wonder how old that bag was.  Pasta by another in our group included oily, overcooked gnocchi that had nothing in it except some microscopic mushrooms and pepper bits. Total cost of ingredients probably $0.50 for a $25 dish. Disgusting appetizer of mushy (catching a trend here?) veal in some weird goopy fish sauce. Only got it because waiter said it contained actual tuna, then he proceeded to argue after it came that he said tuna sauce which all 4 of us swore he did not. No apology for mistake and service was super unfriendly.   Who seemed to be the owner came over and seemed quite hospitable near the end but the night was lost. Toronto does Italian so well this wouldn't survive 5 minutes outside the cloistered Kingsway. Did I mention this was $245 for 3 apps, 1 pasta dish, 2 mains and a glass of wine? You could go to Buca or Unita for less than this. Worst meal this year by far, weighing the price point possibly the worst meal I've EVER had."}
{"text":"All 4 meals sub par, and seriously overpriced.   I really don't have anything good to say."}
{"text":"Just came from dinner at this little gem!  The restaurant is charming and intimate - the perfect neighborhood Italian restaurant.  We shared the warm goat cheese salad, with their fresh bread - amazing!  We ordered the gnocchi, which were homemade and light as feathers.  I think these are some of the best I have ever had.  We also ordered the veal ravioli and they were divine!  The pasta is made fresh daily and it shows.   We did not have room for dessert but the table next to us ordered cheesecake and I almost changed my mind as it looked out of this world but I just had no space left.  I would not hesitate to come back here as the service was friendly and attentive and the food was delicious.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great find, fabulous food, warm environment and very friendly service! Lots of homemade dishes, nice wine selection and definitely don't skip the dessert!"}
{"text":"Their seafood pasta is to die for! For being a very nice sit down restaurant, the prices are very reasonable. If you ever come around the village of Islington, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Recently visited. Upon arrival staff was friendly and attentive.   Good wine list with a lot of variety. Goat cheese salad was outstanding.  Seafood spaghetti and shrimp risotto both excellent choices.   Will definitely return looking forward to the patio in summer!"}
{"text":"We love the local atmosphere  here. It has been open only a couple of months. Vincenzo Malgeri and staff were so helpful and knowledgable . The menu and food are superb. We had their homemade pepper sauce WOW. Thank you for a great dining  experience .."}
{"text":"We are visiting Toronto, from CA, after some research we Picked up this restaurant and very happy we did. Family run restaurant, all family recipes, everything was great, better than expected as well as the device. We defiantly will return next time visiting."}
