{"text":"Imaginative grilled cheese and butter chicken poutine! They have an excellent assortment of cheeses that we didn't try looked great."}
{"text":"The name says it all. Perfect cup of soup and sandwich on a rainy day strolling through the distillery district. 

The warm Watson filament lighting and crafts for sale initially drew us in to escape the dreary weather. After getting a free and amazing Gouda sample, we knew we had to order a meal here.  (All of their cheese is produced in small batches by local Canadian farmers. You can't get it in most other places). 

The woman working recommended we share the soup and sandwich since they have large portions, and she was spot on. The meatloaf sandwich with fresh rye bread meshed so well with the vegan tomato soup. We didn't have the opportunity to partake in the family style seating, but I love that they encourage you to strike up a conversation with tour table \"neighbor.\" 

A cute little French cafe that fits the vibes of the district perfectly. Such a treat."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place while going through the Christmas Market at the Distillery, and I instantly fell in love. They have a great cheese counter where they will give you samples and tell you a bit about the cheeses. They also have everything you could want to make up a wonderful charcuterie board. They have confit, marmalade, jellies and spreads to sample. They have infused olive oils and flat breads. You're sure to find lots of things to your liking.

I particularly liked the Oxford Harvest cheese, which is mild and creamy, yet still very flavourful. Honestly, I just paired it with fresh bread (acquired from a different, nearby bakery) and that was my dinner sorted. I also got their chocolate pecan butter tart. Warmed up, it is the perfect dessert to have with your favourite black tea with honey.

I'll be back very soon to try more of everything!"}
{"text":"Wildly delicious is right! 

This adorable place has a quirky hipster stuff and a ton of sauces -- jam, spreads, honey, all of it -- enough to appease a #saucequeen. 

As for the food, we got the grilled cheese, chicken sandwich, and the egg sandwhich (on a bagel). So delicious we forgot to take more pictures!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The super attentive cashier didn't steer us wrong, the Parmesan crusted grilled cheddar sandwich with added caramelized onions was delicious. The coffee was a bit bitter but much improved with the sample of buckwheat honey, and the Moroccan lentil soup was a nice light vegetarian option. The superstar treats were the two Mary Macleod shortbread cookies: chocolate and maple. The crunchy little maple chunks made the not-too-sweet cookies absolutely sing. Kitchen and barista service definite needs to be better coordinated as we weren't the only table left waiting for our order, but overall a very cool shop in a gorgeous warehouse loft space. Love all the local Canadian goods!"}
{"text":"So I was walking around distillery at the artisan tents, and I got really thirsty. Usually I just suck it up and wait for a bubble tea, but I figured since we're in the alcohol area, why not get some alcohol?

My bf and I didn't know where the breweries or bars were so we popped into the nearest thing that was blasting ac. This was it. 

Decor was clean and very rural Etsy-esque. In not really into western alcohol so I got a \"craft soda\". I never knew such a thing existed but wow it was beautiful and made me appreciate the world. 

This soda was really refreshing and made me realize how fake and over the top mass produced juices were. This soda was created from fruit juices and water and one other ingredient, and it was clean, simple, and refreshing. 

I totally recommend this place if you're looking for a drink that isn't alcoholic. The pear and vanilla soda was best. I'm not really into pear or vanilla but this combo was superb. 

I could live here."}
{"text":"I work in the distillery and so I often grab lunch somewhere in and around the neighbourhood.  The service can be spotty but the food is always fantastic.  Having eaten at nearly every restaurant, bar, bakery and cafe in the area, hands down this is my fav.
Note: Possibly best mac and cheese in the city."}
{"text":"Checked out The Distillery District on a trip to Toronto this weekend. We stopped in here for a snack before heading off on the road. I wasn't really that hungry but since the food looks so good, I decided to get the Moroccan lentil soup. I ordered the bowl size and it was fantastic and leftovers to spare. It came with three slices of bread. My companion ordered the butter chicken poutine which was fantastic. The fries were crispy and delightful and there were lots of cheese curds and chicken with an ample amount of sauce. One of the things that was cute was there were little birds. In the cafe hanging out, yet not bothersome. The cafe is also a store, with all sorts of fantastic food items such as dipping oils, cooking oils, jams, and jellies, mustards and all sorts of things; pretty much everything looked amazing. The prices were really fantastic as well. Many of the items sold in the store are actually made right on premises. Really a great setting and really kind stay. Would definitely recommend and would definitely go back if we're in the area. I bought two cookies from the cookie jar, s'mores cookies and Christmas cookie, both were hard, not fresh and not that great. Skip the cookies!"}
{"text":"Cheese is one of your favorite food items ever so while at the Distillery stumbled upon this place and it's great selection of cheeses 

The staff were super friendly and without us requesting so, offered samples of each cheese we selected so we could be sure we liked our purchases! We selected 4 local cheeses that we would never source back home and they were amazing !!

The cheese was fresh , delicious and made the perfect cheese board at the end of a long day exploring the city! 

The place also has cooking utensils, bake ware , cook books and local bakes - great place"}
{"text":"Nice addition to the Distillery district! Stumbled upon this place when we were out checking the lights festival. Nice place for you to hang out and get a coffee, tea or hot chocolate. They have a few flavours for hot chocolate - best part, you can get it in a dairy free option!

I had tried the peppermint hot chocolate with soy milk and it was nice and minty!

In looking at the menu, you could also grab a bite to eat or walk in their store to look at the different condiments they sell!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars! My husband and I came here about 2 months ago during the Christmas Market. My first reaction was that it was such a cute place - small but there is a lot of fun stuff going on!

One area is for ordering hot items like parmesan truffle fries $12 or assorted baked goods about $4 and up. I believe they also do charcuterie and cheese boards. Another area is for sampling dozens of different kinds of jams and spreads - the savoury and sweet ones that I tried were delicious! Throughout the store are stacks and shelves full of gourmet food items like different oils, seasonings, flavoured shortbread cookies and utensils. 

We ordered the parmesan truffle fries which were good but could have used a bit more truffle oil and parmesan sprinkled evenly throughout the decent sized portion. The bluberry and lemon scone also tasted as it sounds. To me, it was a good blend of sweetness and slight tartness but it wasn't amazing.

All items in general are at a higher price point (items in bottles and the takeout food) but it seemed very fresh and really, it is all about quality for people who shop or buy food here. 

Staff were nice enough but it was really busy here of course on a Friday evening. Definitely recommend stopping by here if you are strolling around the Distillery District."}
{"text":"A nice little shop for coffees and pastries.  However, very disappointed with the portion size.  I ordered a Buddha salad for lunch and got half a salad with romaine lettuce and a few veggies for 10.85.  I understand rent prices but come on, I'll be starving in an hour."}
{"text":"This pop-in shop has a very cute interior (think Pinterest/Instagram). Perf place for your next Instagram photo. They ever had a bar area where you could taste different types of sauces which was pretty neat. I ordered fries with Parmesan cheese and truffle oil. The price was alright (I expected it to cost a bit more) I think it was around $6-$9? The fries itself tasted very good, hot and fresh! Would definitely recommend checking this place out if you're looking for a decently priced snack in the distillery."}
