{"text":"In a word, heavenly! This food is divine. I am so excited to finally have an authentic and delicious Thai restaurant right here in Surprise. I've been in three times and each time gets better. I love the Thai hot Tom Yum soup with mango sticky rice. Friendly staff and fairly quick service too. I'm going to come more regularly."}
{"text":"We ordered this for a lunch group!  What amazing service!  They accomodated us and got our food to us steaming hot and on time! This is a first time pick for all of us and we cannot say enough good thi gs about it!  Job well done!"}
{"text":"I just ordered take out from here. Never again.. Ever!  I bought two orders of orange chicken and pad Thai noodles. 1. It took an hour to get it to me. 2. They forgot the rice for the orange chicken.. Ok no biggie. But when I called to let them know.. The said they would send it out right away. I live less than a mile from them. Here it is 45 min later.. I still haven't received the rice.. So kids are done eating all the chicken and waiting for the rest of the meal. Called to ask about where the delivery person was.. Oh he's on another delivery. We will give you credit for your trouble. ($3.00) and he should be there any minute.. He never showed up. I literally could have driven there and picked it up myself.. Or made my own rice...  Needless to say first time ordering from them.... And never again"}
{"text":"Good Thai food, generous portions, friendly staffs, nice, clean restaurant, you get to create your own stir fry combination, very smart idea."}
{"text":"Their Pad Thai lvl 4 spicy is amazing. Quick and friendly service. Best Thai place in surprise I'd say."}
{"text":"Soooo excited that I live near a GOOD Thai restaurant!  Although the outside looks ehh, the inside was cute and clean. The staff was nice but the most important was the food. I ordered the beef pad Thai and it was oh so yummy!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Pho are you at least once a week. I consider myself somewhat of a snob. By accident I stumbled into this place on Saturday night with my wife. It was queens and authentic and at first I didn't know if I was going to be happy with my  unplanned visit. The shrimp summer rolls we're good the peanut sauce was authentic and delicious but still I was skeptical. Then they delivered the Pho. It was outstanding! The flavor was outstanding the vegetables were cooked perfectly it had the right amount of spice and I like spicy. My favorite new place. The service was a little slow food is absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Tom Yum is friendly and nice. But their food is dry and no flavor. Needs alot of work. Yum Palace is friendly and nice. Their rice and chow mein has a great flavor. A must try. I give them a 5 star."}
{"text":"Nice, clean smaller restaurant with an outdoor area.  Service was tops and the shrimp pad Thai was delicious.  Nice size lunch portion."}
{"text":"The peanut sauce is delicious!! The best crab ragoon, I've ever tasted!! The Tom Kah (coconut soup) is oh my! So Good!!!!! The staff is super nice and make every experience, a wonderful one! Thank you!"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent this place quite a bit. It's absolutely delicious!  We are big lovers of Thai Cuisine and have been to many over the years. This place is definitely one of the best!  The staff is very nice and we've never had anything but a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery so I wouldn't have to lose my mind in traffic. Food arrived with about 15 minutes to spare. Driver nken noodles with pork, thai hot and 2 thai iced teas. The food is really good and the tea as I remember it, really really good! The person who delivered was extremely nice. Will definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I am very pleased with the delivery service. Ordered my food received it it in a timely manner and it was delicious! Service was great."}
{"text":"Meeting some friends for dinner, they live in Whitman. Looks cute from the outside. It is at the back of a very busy shopping center so if you don't know the area, you will have to search a little for it.  We were greeted when we arrived. The waitress took our drink order quickly . We ordered Chicken Satay as that typically takes a bit of time to prepare.  We ordered 4 entrees.  The chicken used for the Satay was not well trimmed of fat, but it tasted ok.  Emperor Shrimp (hot )was beautiful looking and delicious, My friend could not finish it by himself. Drunken noodles also got a rave, though she did not expect a thick wide noodle. I don't normally order this so I wouldn't know what kind of noodle should be in it.  Hubby and I both had curries Panang and Musaman chicken both ordered medium heat . They were both very good and the heat level seemed right on. The only thing I would suggest would be that they cut the chicken and potatoes smaller.    A good time was had by all, the waitress checked on us frequently enough to keep out tea and water filled. I would definitely return and recommend this place."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I love getting the duck pad thai, so flavorful."}
{"text":"Have eaten at this restaurant mny many times and have never been disappointed., the food is outstanding,  the servie is very good and the atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Probably the best restaurant in Surprise."}
{"text":"Great flavorful Thai food. A little pricey but happy to find this on the west side! We had th hot and sour soup, it had the most flavorful broth I've ever had. Also the drunken noodles with shrimp were a kid pleaser. My favorite is the spicy green beans with pork."}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times and ordered take out 3 times and I have not been disappointed. The food is excellent  I would definitely recommend this restaurant spicy or not.     it's Tom yummy"}
{"text":"The service, staff, food was excellent!! I had the crab fried rice and the orange chicken.. Both were delicious and the portions were huge! I will be coming back :-)"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian can be a struggle, but I'm happy to highly recommend this as an excellent place to eat for vegetarians and anyone looking for a great meal that can be customized to one's liking. My favorite foods here are the yellow curry made with tofu and the veggie rolls. The delivery service within 3 mile radius makes this place even better. I've dined in, ordered as takeout, and had the delivery service. Keep up the great work! I know I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant after just opening and ordered two entrees.  Ordered the broccoli and beef with rice (mild) and the chicken over medium spicy noodle.  Both had really good flavor and the meat was well cooked and very tasty.  Received a small bowl of rice and would have preferred a bit more.  The menu was filled with items with pics that made you want to try everything.  Tried the sweet rice dessert and this was just fabulous...highly recommend it.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive and the service was quick.  Restaurant looks nice with a large covered outside patio option.  My only suggestion to the owner would be to lower their prices a bit.  I have seen restaurants in Surprise with good food and fail because the price was a bit high.  Other than that...can't wait to come back and have another meal at this restaurant.  Glad there is now a Thai restaurant in Surprise!!!"}
{"text":"The beef pho was not good, beef was cut into beef stew chunks and were very dry. My wife ordered won ton soup and even the pork in the wonton were dry and tough. Service was just ok"}
{"text":"Always great (taste & portion-wise) food for great prices. My hubby & I order two dishes & share both because it's hard to choose! Definitely give it a try for yourself."}
{"text":"They are a victim of their own success here.   Advice: Do not order delivery, take out or in person during peak times. The food is fantastic, but they can't handle lots of orders. Only order during non-peak times.   These are my actual texts during my last visit 1/2/16.    Need a lot more people working.  They have 2 people handling all of the Internet and phone orders and all the tables.   They can't keep track of all of the orders they have.   One guy has given his order 4 times and they still don't have it.   I heard the waitresses say they aren't answering the phone any more.   They gave my order to someone else. The cooks are cooking it again right now and refunding our money. While I was here for 75 minutes waiting for my food they refunded 5 orders.   Seems their biggest issue is matching  orders with people. They can't seem to keep it straight and are constantly asking people what they ordered."}
{"text":"Wonderful food!  We did take out. The food was fresh, hot and exactly the correct level of spice. The summer rolls were amazing!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in the valley. Highly recommend the Pad Thai. I am not able to eat really spicy or hot food and every time I order from here they understand thst. The wait staff is very good and willing to help at anytime."}
{"text":"Best thai...omg. You need to go and order whatever they tell you to. It's Devine. It's hot on it's own but they can make it even hotter if you want! Amazing staff and bartenders!"}
{"text":"My husband and I highly recommend Tom Yum for their delicious Thai food. It is always prepared to our dietary needs in a pleasant manner. This pleasant attitude keeps us going back  to sample their various menu selections.   Satara was our favorite Thai  restaurant in the west valley. We were thrilled when Tom Yum opened to fill the void."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of  Tom Yum's food.   I'm a yellow curry girl and my husband likes the Pad Thai, but we've liked everything we've tried.  If you're unsure of what to order, just ask your server.  If you don't care for Thai-type flavors (coconut, curry, lime, cilantro, lemongrass, fish sauce, tamarind, chiles), then don't bother with the plainer-sounding items on the menu.  You'll probably be disappointed.  Be aware that on different days, there are different cooks, so the level of heat you order may be slightly different.  I usually go for medium spicy, then request the additional chile powder and sauces to be sent to my table, so I can adjust accordingly.  If you order a dish that is supposed to have some heat and you order it \"no spice\", you will be missing out on the dish's intended flavor.    Their coconut ice cream and mango sticky rice are perfect, so save room.  Delivery to our house was slow (just under an hour), so unless you're homebound, just go pick it up yourself."}
{"text":"LOVE Thai food and frequent Tom Yum because the food is good, fresh and the service is friendly and personable.  I always order the Pad Thai but all their food is really quite good.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended!! Generous portions. We had Orange chicken, Chicken satay, Drunken Noodles with chicken, Hawaiian fried rice, and Thai Iced Coffee delivered. Very tasty. Fed like 5 people. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service not always consistent. Wish they gave veggies on the side with their pho."}
{"text":"Tom Yum is a great place for Thai food.  The restaurant menu is prepared with fresh and delicious soups, appetizers, entrees, combinations, coffees and teas.  Tom Yum has great lunches and prices to match.  Tom Yum is a quant size restaurant that has doubled their seating capacity by adding a terrace or patio .  Tom Yum service is a bit slow because there was only one waitress servicing customers for dinner on Friday.  I did not notice any alcoholic beverages on the menu.  I will definitely try them for lunch."}
{"text":"Great service! Food is on point.. Flavors are so good. I love this place. Already been back a second time and I will continue to go:)"}
{"text":"????????????????????????tomyum?????????????????????????????????????????????hot????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"So I ordered the Combo platter and really want to try the Mee Krub from the combo platter. when the food got delivered to me, they did not give me any napkin or utensils. It turned out they they didn't give me the Mee Krub from the combo platter like it said on the Yelp menu. I called and they told me the Mee Krub is not included. I am very disappointed at this place. It's my second time ordered food here, the first time I got the pad Thai and it tasted terrible but I thought to give it a second try. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy myself at all. From the moment I sat down to a sticky table and disgruntled server.  The iced green tea tasted old and watered down.  The server forgot the extra sides and dessert from the meal.  The food itself was flavor less and greasy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place within 30 miles of my house. Seeing as there is really no other Thai competition in surprise its hard for them to really go wrong. I love their Tom Yum soup and my husband is a fan of the drunken noodles. We have always gotten our food to go so I've no idea what its like to dine in."}
{"text":"We ordered using the Eat24 delivery option.  Our soup, wontons and spring rolls arrived as promised and piping hot. We had asked that the food be prepared at a mild or no spice level, and the food was exactly as we had requested."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe a friend had recommended this place. It was the most mediocre food I've had in ages, and the server messed up my very simple order, then brought lukewarm food out to add to the existing dinner on my plate. Blaaaah. Not going back."}
{"text":"Base on our visit Saturday between 12:30-1:30. CUSTOMER SERVICE GUYS..   Food was just average, nothing that stood out from other Thai places. *Noddles were very rubbery. *We had better tasting Thai food .  Only reason why we are NOT coming back is the customer service. It was not busy at all when we were there. Our server was a lady that was lacking basic customer service skills.  We constantly had to be getting her attention, for soda refills, she forgot out plates and just her over all attitude. We got the feeling she didn't want to be there. I regret giving a good tip now. Specially when all she care was about us paying our bill. Drop off the bill with out saying anything. Thats very annoying and unprofessional.  We are not coming back."}
{"text":"I really like Tom Yum. I'm not a huge fan of Thai food in general. (I prefer Indian curries most of the time) However, the green curry here is delicious and crave able. Also, the last time we went here we got a shrimp soup that was delicious. I would recommend Tom Yum heartily to anyone that asked."}
{"text":"Ordered to-go through the online 3rd party. Restaurant was clean and I was helped promptly when I arrived to pick up my order. Very good noodle soup!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Great service!  Knowledgable staff :).  Get the massaman curry - you'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"A great find! The Red Curry & Tofu was wonderful. Also tried the spicy green beans that were very good. Can't wait to go back and try Eggplant, vegetables & tofu.  Lots of choices on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in AZ! Its my \"just got the paycheck lemme treat myself\" go to :)  I always get pad-see-ew when I go anywhere - and this place is the best!  I get the pad-see-ew mild heat with the seafood combo of shrimp squid cod.... so so good! It's the perfect amount of veggie eggs and noodles.  Perfect paired with a Thai tea. If you've never had a Thai tea it's a sweet creamy black tea (bright orange in color) and it's delish!!"}
{"text":"It's OK but not the greatest. Chicken Pad-Thai wasn't up to Par but the Tom Yum soup was good."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch, service was great!  Was greeted and sat immediatly, they frequently asked if I was doing good.  I had the Yellow Curry(Lunch size), it also came with white rice and two veggie rolls.  I will definetely be back when in the area!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Surprise. Good service and consistently good food. Pretty vegetarian/vegan friendly. I recommend the yellow curry w/ tofu."}
{"text":"What a great find...and in such an unexpected place! One would never think there would be a culinary oasis in the NW Valley, but now one has been found!  This restaurant is gorgeously decorated without being prissy. The waitress greets you with a complimentary soup and fried roll with a delicious accompanying sauce. What a great start!   Choose your protein! Choose your sauce! Done! You really cannot go wrong with their menu. The chicken is ample and the beef dishes are cooked to perfection. The vegetables, cooked nicely, still had a nice crunch.   The curry dishes are simply wonderful, no matter whether you choose red, yellow or spice level. Run with your choice and enjoy!  Again, this restaurant is WAY the heck out of nowhere (do not ask my why I was even near lol), but if you ever find yourself out this way, please do check this gem out!"}
{"text":"Food was good !! Service was very bad, my water cup  empty about 4o minutes and no one refill my drink !!! !!! when I call sever bring my check.   Still wait about 15min nobody take care me !!!         Never come back again  !!!"}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery and was given a wait time of 45 to 60 minutes. 2 hours later my food was delivered. It was cold and not all the items ordered were there. I tried to call many, many times and either no one answered or it gave a busy signal. I will never eat there again. They either need to hire more help or not offer delivery. Poor, poor service."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this establishment twice now, and had a poor experience each time.  It wasn't because of the food though, which is certainly passable.  It was the service!  Slow service on the first visit, and on my second visit today, they overcharged for my lunch.  When asked about the error, a server admitted they had mistakenly given me a dinner portion rather than a lunch portion.  I asked her to correct the error, but she refused because I'd been served the dinner portion (of which I ate less than half--I only wanted a lunch). It became a standoff until another server came by, responded politely, took responsibility and changed the ticket.  That mistake and their initial response cost them the time to deal with the problem, in addition to the loss of a customer and publication of this review.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"I ordered tofu green curry and it was really good. I prefer my tofu steamed but could not order it that way so I settled on the fried  tofu. This place makes it spicier than most so I had to order down from a 3 to a 2 and I am glad that I did because the 2 was spicy. I give it a four instead of a 5 because of the tofu but other than that, it is great"}
{"text":"The service was excellent! And if your in to hot food they offer a double Thai hot option which is very hot but really good. My wife is a vegan and they have plenty of options for her as well. 6 stars!"}
{"text":"I ordered the green curry dish for dinner and it was very tasty but it didn't come with enough white rice. Most likely will return."}
{"text":"Fresh, colorful and very tasty. Their lunch special is an amazing deal! Upon arrival we received a nice plate of small egg rolls and a delightful soup. We tried both the yellow and green curries, hot and mild respectively. The veggies were fresh; the portions were generous; and the sauces were right on. We also learned that they have another location in Central Phoenix called Thai'd Up near us that we will certainly try next."}
{"text":"This is definitely a restaurant we'd return to any time we're in the west valley and in the mood for Thai food.  The dishes we ordered (Pad Thai and Spicy Green Beans) were excellent, as good as any we've had on the Left Coast.  The service was cordial, polite, and efficient.  Wait times from the kitchen were short, too.  I also enjoyed the iced green tea, which isn't common where we lived in SoCal."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I LOVED IT.  The atmosphere was serene, the food was delicious and the staff was very friendly. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went there during the second week of the opening-unfortunately i did not have so great experience. The orders was SO slow and the waitress was very clumsy and inexperienced. We ordered crab puffs for appetizer before dinner and I wasn't so impressed with it due to too much cream cheese filling.   My husband ordered wide rice noodles with beef and i ordered clear noodles with mixed seafood and our foods turned out very bland. They put way too much onions in my food, the most amount i have ever seen. The foods does not taste as pretty as they looked. It is definitely NOT an authentic thai food-i'd say its more like an american thai food. I have gone to hundreds of thai places to comparing with this one was one of the worse place. The  Line Thai restaurant in Sun City West is 100 times better and I will be going back to that place and stick with it."}
{"text":"First time to order online at Tom Yum. My order was hot and ready to go, everything was prepared just as I order. Of course the food is great as it's always is! A great choice for authentic Thai meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  My wife and I love it.  We've tried 6 or 7 different entrees here and it is up to par with any other great Thai restaurants we've been to around the country.  Service is always great and you can't beat the lunch specials.  2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from here and it isn't even close to what I expected. First off, both of the meals that I ordered feel like their missing half the damned ingredients. Usually when I order bbq beef I expect more beef than veggies, however I only had maybe 7 little strips of beef and almost an entire tomato. My wife's meal on the other hand was almost non existent. There's was only about a handful of noodles in the box. These two meals were not worth 30 dollars. I do not recommend this restaurant at all for delivery."}
{"text":"It was tough for me to go with a lower star rating, especially since I really want to see this place succeed, but I had to go to 3 stars from 4 simply because the service is spotty.  I really enjoy the food. I find it decently authentic, especially since I'm spoiled by really good Thai food all over San Diego.   The thing is that the service isn't where it should be. It's still better than it was - the first time I visited, it took forever to get our appetizers and drinks - but something about how inconsistent the service was just bugged me. Took a while for water at some times, when it was quiet it felt like nobody was ready to take our order, things like that.   I really like the pad thai here, though. My dad seemed to enjoy his sweet and sour pork, but I don't think he was blown away. I have previously ordered the pad si yew and that was pretty good as well.  I also found the spiciness to be a little inconsistent. My dad ordered the same level of spiciness each time and they were a little far apart. Not sure what's up with that.  I'm going to have to try some curries next time and see for myself how the spiciness scale is (I have ordered noodles and I don't typically order noodles to be very spicy).   Although the prices seem fair from a San Diego perspective, I think they're a little high for Surprise.   I hope these guys figure out their consistency and service issues because it would be a real shame for this place to be doing poorly, especially when there aren't a whole lot of options in Surprise for Thai."}
{"text":"Yum Yum! Wow that was great food, delivered so quickly too! We are new to this area and the Yelp reviews proved to be correct!"}
{"text":"We happened upon this place, when we tried to go to Applebees but found that it had burned down, since our last visit. I was thinking that it was  very bold having \"Yum\" in your name. Living up to that name would be a tall order in the cut throat restaurant world of Grand ave and Bell Rd. Turns out the name is for a Thai soup and is not a customer attraction and engagement system. I Really! Really! like Tom yum soup, try it and thank me (you will). Also pick out any curry and you shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Sticky rice with custard is outstanding!!! The service however is horrible. I would suggest getting ToGo. With three servers and only three tables occupied I would expect amazing service.  But we had to ask for our drinks to be refilled. The guy server came back twice to verify what we had ordered. And finally another server came to pick up our card to pay the bill when we couldn't get our servers attention. And not to mention the inappropriate conversation going on between the employees was oh so great to listen to during our dinner. Definately not very professional people. Will for sure order the food again, but will certainly be eating it at my dining room table."}
{"text":"Great food - got dinner takeout and the portions were very small. I came home, there was very little chicken and veggies in my panang. I cooked some broccoli in the microwave to add to it.  Great flavor, nice service .. Not the best value."}
{"text":"If I had written this review on the first day it opened I would have given it a 5.  You can excuse little hiccups in the beginning.  Originally, we went weekly and enjoyed everything we ordered.  The service was good or spotty with them forgetting my lunch order till I asked about it.  I watched one poor elderly couple who was there before us eating appetizers. Our family was out before them, when they were still waiting on their entrees. Be assertive. The final straw why we no longer go at all is the prices compared to the decreasing portions and the staff power struggle with one waitress greedily grabbing \"good tables\".  I really wanted to be able to enjoy Thai food in my city, but sadly that will have to wait.  Not worth it to me.  Also no kid meals, must order an adult entrée."}
{"text":"I tried to edit my review from last time. Not sure it worked. But the management made it right. She sent us a $50 gift card so we would come try it again. We did today and had a wonderful experience.   We ordered: crab Rangoon (tasty), Massuman, and chicken and broccoli with peanut sauce. My kids got chicken and broccoli over flat noodles. We loved everything! I'm really wishing I would have gotten the green curry. I will for sure go back and am glad Tara took the time to make it up to us!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted, the food is fresh and delicious.  My favorites are the veggie rolls, and the spicy basil.  I also love that they are not afraid to add heat.  They have regular, thai spicy and something beyond that is probably hotter than I can handle.  I do agree that the man that appears to be in charge could brush up on his manners, but, he is busy so I am willing to cut him some slack."}
{"text":"My son and I had dinner at the Surprise location last evening. The summer rolls and potstickers were delicious.  I had a salad Tiger Cry and my son a noodles entree with beef. We will be back! The menu is great and the food very good!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I ordered $70 worth of food, it came luke warm, everything majorly over cooked to the point of mush and the portions were literally containers the size of tea saucers. Just crazy. I can not understand where this place gets off charging the prices they do for such small portions and old reheated food. The chicken was so dry it had to have been cooked many days ago."}
{"text":"First time here after reading reviews and I went in expecting a really good meal. That is exactly what we got too. Started with the crab Rangoon since everyone said they were amazing and true to my fellow yelpers, they truly were. I then had the shrimp clay pot for my entree. By far one of the best meals in a while. Perfectly seasoned and cooked.  My partner had the summer rolls with shrimp to start and their version of the hoisen sauce that went with them was very very good. His main entree was the chicken pad Thai seasoned \"Thai Hot\" which mixed with the sweetness of the dish made the heat just right.  We didn't have dessert since we were both full but next time I want to try the sweet sticky rice with custard. That sounds amazing.  Overall I highly recommend this place and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great service and decent food that we stumbled upon driving from LA to Sedona last week. We tired, and STARVING!!!! The food tasted super fresh and our waitress was very friendly. We ordered the Tom Yum soup with shrimp and then the chicken pad thai and a side of brown rice and steamed veggies. We will definitely return if we are craving Thai food and are passing through again."}
{"text":"First time here, I got the pad Thai with shrimp and tofu medium. This was absolutely amazing! Perfect amount of spice and lots of shrimp. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute delight! Whether you're going in or having it delivered! We love their orange chicken and Thai tea. So far everything we've tried has been great!"}
{"text":"I'm spoiled just a bit. I like Thai food and my girlfriend is Thai.  So I'm down here in Surprise, AZ and praying Yelp can help me find some tasty food for dinner during the week. I must say other reviews of Tom Yum are pretty accurate. The food here was delicious. Honestly, when you see sticky rice and mango as a dessert option at any Thai restaurant chances are the food is going to be some level of authentic. The cheap crappy places don't take the time to prepare sticky rice desserts.  Anywhoo, I made the mistake of ordering a lemonade to drink before I actually browsed the menu. Unfortunate repercussion of leaving 0* weather for 80* weather...I was thirsty and in a hurry to consume some refreshing liquid. If I ever return I will certainly try the Thai iced tea. I enjoyed a lot of that when traveling around Thailand a couple years ago. It's delicious.  After finally opening the menu and regretting jumping at the lemonade I noticed there was more than just Thai in the menu. There was some Vietnamese and some Chinese mixed in. Honestly I think that's more of a good sign as there is a lot of Chinese heritage in Thailand and Vietnam is a neighbor. To get that combination you're looking at Bangkok or a little to the northeast. Good food there.  After mulling over the menu for a bit I opted for the panang curry with pork. When confronted with the dreaded \"how spicy\" question I had to play it safe and go mild. There is seldom any consistency from one restaurant to the next when it comes to levels of spice. When in doubt play it safe, and occasionally you'll be pleasantly surprised. Having been to Thailand (north, central, and south) I know that not all Thai food is hot and spicy. A lot of it is quite savory. Behold the mild panang curry! With just enough spice to know it's there (like a spicy chicken sandwich from Wendy's) you can capture the wonderful sweet nature of panang curry. I had planned on eating half and ordering dessert. It was so delicious that I wound up finishing all of it.  Now back to the sticky rice and mango. This is quite possibly my girlfriend's favorite dessert on the planet. She occasionally makes it at home and it's always a treat. Don't read \"rice\" and wonder how it's a dessert. It's cooked with sugar and coconut milk. It's candied rice. With some toasted sesame seeds on top and fresh mango on the side it truly is amazing. And this comes from a guy with a severe sweet tooth. Let me pick a piece of cake and every time it'll be the one with more frosting on it. Needless to say, I made room for dessert and it was fantastic. You can't go wrong with this one.    I'm left wishing I had more time in Surprise to be further surprised. I actually like green curry more than I like panang. I was simply not in the mood for the eggplant this evening and that's part of the green curry combination. I have to resist returning so I can give a few of the other well-reviewed restaurants in the area a try."}
{"text":"The only Thai place in Surprise keeps bringing the their A game. The chicken Satay is always on my table when I come here. I hate to get into a rut but I find it difficult not to order the yellow curry or Pad Thai. I see all the other wonderful items available that I should try but I'm always drawn back to these delectable dish's."}
{"text":"Customer service was poor. We were ignored for a long time while waiting for someone to take our order. Not very many customers when we came in.  We waited a very long time for take out food.  Customers who came in after us were almost done eating.  And the portions of the food were small.  Food was ok. We won't go here again.  Would rather go to Pato Thai all the way up to Flagstaff for our favorite Thai food!"}
{"text":"Wow, it gets better every time. The food is great, great service, and a convenient location for the Surprise crowd. They always seem to have people in there so they must be doing something right! Chicken pad thai noodles are the best. My wife gets the orange chicken and we usually end up splitting it, and still manage to take a whole plate home! I could go on but I am sure you get the point, it's a safe bet for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Yum in their name is so correct. Everything we have tried has been delicious. The coconut soup and pad thai are my favorites. The service is great even when the place is packed."}
{"text":"Everything is seriously so good here. If I could I would go here EVERY SINGLE DAY well I almost do. food is great along with great service. what more do you want"}
{"text":"Ive spent some time in thailand. i love the food, so took my wife to try this place. We had the tom ka gai soup. O man, you need to eat this, it is off the hook unreal! Order some and tell me its not the best soup you've ever had, and presented like ive never seen before. This is definitely my favorite restaurant in surprise, and has to be the best thai in AZ. Also highly recommend the yellow curry, pad thai, and crab rangoon, all amazing... Seriously do not listen to the negative reviews... Just go and try it for yourself. This place is not super busy and its too bad because it is real, healthy, unprocessed food, they even grow their own herbs on the patio. Do yourself a favor next time you have to wait in line at any of the mediocre chains on bell rd and go to Tom Yum instead. Great service too, every time we've been there."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Surprise and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered.  The Crab Rangoon are very tasty and fresh and an excellent way to start a meal.  My usual dish is Chicken with Peanut Sauce and I've found it rather addictive.  Normally I order it as double-Thai hot which gives it a great kick.    A friend who tried Thai food a long time ago but had a bad experience tried it here and he really liked his meal.  Now he's a regular at a local Thai restaurant in San Diego.  I hope this place sticks around for a long time."}
{"text":"Went into Tom Yum for my birthday lunch with my Mom while I was visiting my parents over Christmas 2014. We ordered the Mee Krob as an appetizer. It was ok in my mind. My Mom liked it more than I did. Wished I had ordered the spring rolls. I ordered the Drunken Noodles (chicken) while my Mom ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai. Food was good but I guess it tasted the same as other Thai places that I eat at in Vegas. Nothing stood out as spectacular. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Bottom Line?  Abysmal!  I've lived in Thailand and decided to have lunch here.  Terribly understaffed for a huge lunch crowd.  Thai hostess was very sweet and she handled herself well despite so many angered guests who waited minutes before getting seated.  The hostess was the only person taking orders while there was a man - presumably the owner - who spoke rudely to his guests.  Many people left the restaurant to go somewhere else.  The food is NOT authentic and does NOT represent real Thai food.  What you get here is \"Americanized\" Thai food, which is ok for those who enjoy the taste and are not too concerned about authenticity.  As of 2/15/16, I was told the cook was new and was trying his best.  Maybe he'll get better as time progresses and he learns how to cook Thai the proper way.    Horrible experience!  I would be surprised if this restaurant remains in business."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the west valley...period! Their spicy basil chicken and mosiman? curry are to die for."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery so I cannot speak to the restaurants ambiance. They promised delivery in 30 minutes and they were right on time. Pad Thai was delicious! So happy they are in Surprise.  Nice break from Panda Express."}
{"text":"Been there twice and whaaaaaaa, I can't remember if it's Dragon or Drunken Fried Rice but it's the bomb diggity. 1st time we went for lunch was a lot better than the 2nd time we went to dinner. Can you tell that waiter kid to pull up his pants tho'?"}
{"text":"Tom Yum  Location/Parking: In the Walmart/Home Depot strip mall on Grand and Bell.   Atmosphere: Clean, quiet, bright, and open. Small bar but with plenty of decent enough wines.  Cleanliness: Very clean and tidy. Would you expect anything less from a Thai place?  Service: Attentive without being motherly. Your glass stays full but you don't feel like you're being watched.   Food/Drinks: On my first visit, we started with Spring Rolls. Very tasty and light. Always a good choice. I ordered the Red Curry Chicken with Green Beans and my husband got the Chicken and Broccoli in Peanut Sauce. Holy crap, they were so delicious!  On my second visit, we stopped in for an early dinner and a glass of wine. This time we tried the Summer Rolls. Yum! Fascinating little apps wrapped in rice paper. Good stuff. I got #5, Ginger Angel - Onions, mushrooms, fresh ginger and bell pepper sautéed in garlic ginger sauce. My husband got #8, Spicy Green Bean - Green bean in Thai'd up curry paste with a touch of green bell pepper.   On my third visit, a friend and I went in for lunch. I got Red Curry Chicken - Thai red chili pepper base, eggplant, green bean, bell pepper and basil - and my friend got Pad Thai. She said it was really good. We shared an order of the Crab Rangoon as an appetizer. That stuff was outstanding. I could seriously eat a whole plate of those all by myself.  Happy Hour: None that I'm aware of, but any hour that you're holding a glass of wine is pretty happy.  Price: $8-$10. Nice lunch specials. Delicious Thai food that won't break the bank.  I can't describe how good this food tastes. Pictures just don't do it justice.  I definitely need to go back until I eventually try the whole menu. It's really good and you won't be disappointed. Try it for lunch first if you're afraid of commitment."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with the relatives yesterday and it was delicious. The pad thai was flavored just right with a little heat. Large & adequate number of pieces of shrimp served on top (if you wish). Not those little funky shrimp."}
{"text":"First Thai experience was great!  The waitress was so helpful on suggesting menu items based on our communicated likes.  The food was fresh, fast and delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Tom Yum Thai in Surprise for the first time this evening.  We were both very pleased with the food, the the friendly service, the timely service, the clean appearance and the ambiance.  The menu choices were great!  We especially liked the 1. 2. 3. step dinners.  And the mild, medium, hot, extra hot spice choice was great, too.  We will be returning.  A few of the Yelp reviews were not so good, but being a new place, perhaps they took note and straightened up their act...it has been open for about 2 months."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now. I'm really trying to like it since there isn't a Thai place in Surprise. Honestly, the food is mediocre. The people are super friendly, but the food just isn't really good. My dish took all but 6 minutes to come out of the kitchen, which is quick. But, authentic Thai food wouldn't take 6 minutes to craft."}
{"text":"Oh.my.goodness.  I'm addicted. I was wary of eating here based on the reviews. I've eaten Thai everywhere from Chicago to LA. So I chose a safe dish, pad thai w/tofu & veggies. It was not like any pad thai I've ever had but it was AMAZING. So good, I actually want it again, now. We also ordered the crispy tofu and spring rolls, both awesome with their sweet & sour sauce. Kids liked it. Finished with their homemade coconut ice cream-they need to sell it by the container for sure-it's so delicious.  I question the size/intake of the reviewers who complain about the portion sizes. We've had leftovers every time. Possibly these are the reviews of guys in a starting NFL lineup? I dunno....  Side note--service is so-so. First time we went, we had to call the waitress over every single time, for anything. She may also have been planning for a zombie apocalypse or something bc we had to practically pry extra napkins and silverware away from her. Second visit, no issues."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It's so good! Thai spicy! Is where it's at!!! Super cute!"}
{"text":"I hate to leave bad reviews, but I feel like it's important to let others know what the food is like.   This isn't to remark on the service at all. Everyone there was incredibly nice and had my order out in a quick and timely manner.  Unfortunately, the food just wasn't very good or authentic. I've been to Thailand several times and have a number of Thai friends--this doesn't taste anything close to the kinds of food I've had abroad and I think the limited menu also reflects that. After reading the reviews, I decided to play it safe with the Pad Thai and Drunken Noodle--two dishes that are fine even if they're pretty Americanized. The Pad Thai was bland, and didn't have any of that distinctly fish sauce-y flavor. I'd say it was more savory than your typical Pad Thai and they threw in a lemon instead of lime. The chicken in it was also a bit dryer than I had expected. The Drunken Noodle wasn't quite so flavorless, but it was certainly off--almost like they went too hard on the basil, but I'm not quite sure.   However, the portion sizes are appropriate for the price, and that's why I gave it a 2nd star. If you've had a lot of Thai food, this place isn't for you, but if you live in the area and the flavor is what you're accustomed to then it's a solid value."}
{"text":"2/15/16 around 3:30 Have done business here a few times prior-their food is decent quality with fresh ingredients prepared to order. Unfortunately, had terrible experience once inside. There were two tables occupied, yet the checker/clerk handed me a menu and said she'd be right with me. Awkward, as I made my decision prior to entering-menus are outside, but politely glanced at the menu again. The cashier/rude/clerk proceeded to complete some sort of paperwork inventory. After almost 2 minutes another employee-came out and asked how I was doing. I told him I was waiting to order. He glanced at the obnoxious oblivious cashier/clerk uncertain, and to his credit asked if my sons and I would  like something to drink. I said no I just wanted to order. Another minute or so passed-hard to tell feels like an eternity standing at a counter with the help with their back to you, and told my boys let's leave. Now they had two tables occupied, stopped by Panda Express-would rather not eat than eat there, but they had a line almost out the door with cashiers ready to help. I will be happy to spit in the face of the owner of the establishment who questions why they had to close their doors. They better not suggest it was Surprise, no it is your rude lack of help."}
{"text":"yum yum just like the name says! Come in for the lunch specials as the prices are great."}
{"text":"We have been eating here forvtwo years, they are delicious, courteous and quick! Tom Yums will cater to your whims and tweak recipes if you ask(I always say no onions). I love the vegetable yellow curry which I have them add eggplant and mushrooms to. My boyfriend ordered the MASSAMAN STEWED BEEF tonight with thai massaman chilies in coconut milk with stewed beef, potatoes and peanuts...it was delicious!  The chicken pad thsi is also delectable. The coconut ice cream is worth ordering even if you're full. The entrees are big enough to split with generous portions. Tom Yums is...yum!"}
{"text":"Holy cow. We just finished our delivery order. It's safe to say we found our new favorite place! The food is fresh tasting, the perfect spice, and absolutely wonderful tasting! The tofu is cooked to PERFECTION! The veggie rolls were way better than expected... Home made to say the least! No gross msg full feeling after this meal... Just satisfaction :)! Generous portions, as well!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and flavorful. The waitstaff is always tentative and very knowledgeable. My favorite is the Tom Kha soup!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this place recently and we both enjoyed ourselves. We've spent a couple of years searching for good Thai food in the Peoria/Glendale area and couldn't find anything. So one day as we drove through Surprise, we stumbled upon this tiny restaurant in a home depot strip mall and stopped in for lunch. My wife had a cold so she got a bowl of Tom Kha and the Panang curry. I got the Massaman curry and we shared the combo satay. The Tom Kha was flavorful and quite delicious. Both curry dishes we're also very flavorful and delicious. I wouldn't get the combo satay again, the only part of it I liked was the chicken and the next time I'd get the chicken satay instead. All in all, the food was great. The best tasting Thai food we've had so far.    For those who are sticklers for water, they're water is filtered and had no funny taste to it, which is a plus."}
{"text":"This place is so tasty! Came here and got some appetizers and some pad Thai. Everything was delicious and the staff was very friendly. Definitely would come back for some medium spice pad Thai!!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! The food is fast and delicious. I ordered the ginger chicken dish and was very very happy. The staff is also very nice and attentive. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and my food arrived pretty fast. I ordered the beef pad Thai which was the best pad Thai I have had in a long time. The spice level was hot and got me sniffling a little bit but I love spice so I was just testing the waters, next time I will try Thai hot. My stepson ordered the chicken chow mein mild which he said was ok but I don't always trust the palette of a 14 year old. We shared an order of spring rolls which were pretty good. I'd definitely recommend eating here, I'll update you the next time I go."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the yellow curry with chicken from here, Thai hot. I was able to order through Yelp and my food was delivered within an hour. I recently went into the location to sit and dine, nice staff but a little lack of training from what I saw. The food is the reason I come back, everything is good and fresh."}
{"text":"Glad I stop by and try their food! Pad Thai here is delicious and it just taste like high quality! I got shrimp with my Pad Thai and it tasted so good! We also order green beans with beef and the sauce is so savory. It's a little overprice here but for that price and the food is good, I wouldn't mind at all. Our server was fantastic and she was very friendly. Everyone there is super nice! I would definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!! Honestly, I can say this place has the best Pad Thai I have ever had. My husband and I wanted to try something new around Surprise, which can be difficult for us since we usually always settle for wings. We are very happy to add another option to dinner list."}
{"text":"I love Thai Food and this is some of the best around.  The restaurant is full service and offers take out as well. The good is very flavorful and fresh with the right amount of spice level.  The restaurant decor is nice as there are booths and tables or barstools at the small bar. There is a large covered outdoor patio with full service. The staff are very friendly and attentive.  The prices are average, but reasonable for portions.  Lunch specials are offered with soup,eggroll and rice.  I would highly recommend this Thai restaurant in Surprise."}
{"text":"The workers were friendly - but I didn't really enjoy he food. I've had much much better pad Thai for even cheaper price. The appetizer I had also tasted so different from what I was used it."}
{"text":"Another great find! Tried the fish with three discuss, BBQ fried rice and Tom Yum soup. All highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I work near Thai Town in the L.A. area so I know good Thai food. That said the Tum  Yum Thai restaurant in the Surprise, AZ was very good and Hell of spicy. We had the Coconut Tum Yum Spicy (Quite flavorful and spicy), Fried Curried Rice and my favorite Pad Thai. All the dishes were good. My only complaint was the service! It was a takeout order and no one wanted to give us extra sauce. Maybe b'cuz they were about to close but those 3 dishes cost nearly $40 so I expect a lil' better attention. Also, I would've toned down the spice on some dishes if someone over there was interested in giving good customer service. So 4 1/2 Stars for the food and 2 1/2 stars for the service = 3 stars"}
{"text":"Our neighbors recommended this place and we are glad they did!! Had a few dishes and soup and the food was very good and we will be back! Try the Panang chicken, drunken noodles and pad Thai with chicken , all good!!"}
{"text":"Very great food! The veggie spring rolls amazing as well. The medium spice was just perfect!! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Went here on opening day - didn't know if they'd be open yet or not, but the wife had a craving so we decided to check. Front door was wide open. Nice little place - got seated immediately and attended to by a fairly nice waitress. Imagine my surprise when I checked the menu and saw Vietnamese pho! I'm a big fan, and while I was guessing it wouldn't be up to par with more centrally-located places like Pho Thanh I decided to give it a shot. The wife had massaman curry which she asked to be made quite spicy (\"Thai Hot\" as they call it). My pho, as predicted, wasn't that great. The meat was cut into thick chunks and the broth was actually sweet! I called one of the servers over and asked about it - they said that the cook was used to Thai dishes and had put a little too much sugar in as that's the norm with other stuff like the satay sauce etc. Fair enough, like I said I was expecting it. Taste aside, it wasn't a huge bowl and it was $10 - very much overpriced. I honestly don't know why I got it at a Thai restaurant, I suppose it's just because I like it so much that when I saw it on the menu my eyes glazed over. Like getting a burger at a Dairy Queen or something? (shrug) Anyways, the wife thoroughly enjoyed her curry - quite spicy but not too spicy for her. Note that she was charged an extra $1 for brown rice - a little too nickel-and-dimey for my liking. My kid had his usual chicken satay sticks. The chicken was dry and leathery, so marks dropped for that. Decor was nice, menu was done very well (see my photo).  All in all a fairly average experience. We'll be back to check out other dishes (Thai ones! *8-) and to support this new local business, but these folk certainly have a lot of catching up to do before they draw level with Line Thai in Sun City and (so far) wouldn't be our first choice for lunch or dinner going forward if we were starving."}
{"text":"Consistently good. For that, it remains a local favorite.   And, you know a place is good when you're not the only ones sitting in your car, waiting in the parking lot for the place to open.   In the interest of fair reviews, I do have to say this--what the fuck was up with the kitchen?  Our waiter came, brought our drinks, took our order, and brought our food out as it was readied.   And, I swear this is true, every time our waiter would go back to the kitchen, there would come a typhoon of curses & yelling.  At first we didn't know what to make of it until we heard all 'our favorite four-letter words.   The second time the door shut, it sounded like the best of Jerry Springer: Trailer Park Edition.   The third time it shut, My wife and I looked at each other and immediately started taking bets on who is winning the waiter or the cook.   You stopped chewing so you could hear the slap of meat, and the crack of knuckle against jaw cos you just knew 'everybody was Kung Foo Fighting' ( that's racist ).   It was pretty cool."}
{"text":"I love fresh rice paper rolls and after taking a quick glance at the menu, I knew I had to give this restaurant a try in spite of the what appeared to be total disorganization.    Instead of being seated, a waitress made eye. Intact and pointed to a nearby table and told me to \"take that table in the middle.\"  Seemed odd, but I followed her instruction. Another waitress soon popped over with a menu and asked for my Oder.  It was going to cost me $8 for two fresh shrimp spring rolls, a bit pricey, but I was willing to spend it to give them a try.    I say pricey, because the Line Thai restaurant in Sun City only charges $3 for two and they are excellent, but as I said I wanted to give Tom Yum's rolls a try.    As I overheard customers complaining about long waits and poor service, I began to wonder if I made a poor decision and became a little anxious as I joined the other guests getting tired of waiting for my food.  Suddenly my waitress appeared with a cup of soup and what I would called a fried egg roll.  Both were very tasty and I now felt excited about tasting my fresh rice paper rolls.  They arrived with two sauces on the plate. They were not bad, but I preferred the sweet and sour dipping sauce that came with the fried egg roll, so I requested more from a waitress that walked by.  She brought a small to go cup of sweet and sour, which was disappointing, but I made do.  To be fair, all my food was good. Not spectacular, but good.  I can't say the same for the service or the environment.  It was uncomfortable to hear customers complain and be surrounded with tables that needed to be bused.    I am hoping the owners monitor Yelp and see have a few customer services issues to resolve.   As for me, I will give this little spot a second try -- when I'm once again shopping in the area and want a quick bite."}
{"text":"I love here! My favorite is their massaman curry with shrimp. Service is great and affordable price. :)"}
{"text":"We love this place! I am a big fan of Thai cuisine, and this hits the spot. I especially love that it's just a mile or so north of our house; we often walk here instead of driving. The food is yummy, the prices are right, and I love that it's not a big, crowded place-- however we hope that they do get good business, as it'd be a shame to lose them!"}
{"text":"i love this place, the staff is always super freindly and the food is absolutely amazing. been coming here and there other location for years and have never been disappointed. the yellow curry is fantastic as well as my other favorite, the broccoli noodles, spiced to perfection with tofu or they evan offer vegan chicken or vegan beef. ive taken freinds here with me and noone has ever not enjoyed there food. if your in the bell/grand area of surprise, i highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Got hungry on Christmas and didn't feel like cooking again. We took an chance and they were open. This is the 4th time.we have been here and the food has ways been hot and fresh and the service has been solid. Some of the best curry I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Being from California, there's alot of exposure to asian cuisines. Thai food is one of my favorites and my palate knows \"Good Eats\". This place is over priced, portions are small. Flavor is blah.... When we asked for spicy, it was medium. Yellow curry was bland and had more veggies over protein. Pad thai serving was half portion for a full. Basically you're paying for the ambience and the food is second.  It's amercanized... It will suffice a newbie to thai cuisine but it wouldn't flatter a seasoned palate. Line Thai has better customer service and authenticity. When I tried to order via phone for a pick up, they kept me on hold FOREVER and they didn't even bother getting back on to acknowledge that I was holding. I finally hung up and called back and asked them why they keep customers on hold so long. Lack of customer service. The female had an attitude and got defensive!   What a shame.... Some of the workers at this establishment can barely annunciate the dishes correctly."}
{"text":"My teenage son and I visited durin opening week.  The location was easy to find and parking was decent.  The dining area was beautifully decorated in greens and golds, with great attention to detail.  Upon entering a server asked us how many then pointed and told us to, \"sit over there\". Um.  Ok.  We sat where directed.  Our unfriendly server approached the table quickly and asked for our drink order, as we finished ordering drinks she asked if we were ready to order our lunch.  Having eagerly anticipated the opening of this restaurant, I knew exactly what I wanted and ordered immediately.  My son wasn't quite so quick to order so it took him a minute.  I ordered the Red Curry lunch special and my son ordered the Pad Thai lunch special.  Our soup came out fairly quickly and was slightly cooler than a soup would normally be, but the flavor made up for it.  Our entrees came at about average speed and were nicely presented.  The appearance of the Pad Thai made me rethink my curry- until I tasted it.  We both ordered our entree's mild since mild is subjective and we knew we could add spice if needed.  The Pad Thai was so spicy tears immediately sprang to my eyes!  My son gave a valiant effort at eating it, but soon gave up.  The chicken in his meal was delicious, but my eat-whatever-doesn't-eat-me-first carnivore son said the beef tasted off and the texture was \"funny\".  I didn't try it. My Red Curry was outstanding!  Big chunks of eggplant, red pepper, green beans and chicken made it visually appealing as well as delicious!  My mild Red Curry was slightly too mild, but there was no way I was going to ask for more spice after tasting my kiddo's meal! During our entire visit a server did not visit our table one time to check on our meal or to refill waters- which my son desperately needed.   The meal was a bit expensive $20 for lunch \"specials\". I will definitely try Tom Yum again hoping for a better experience.  p.s. as we were leaving an elderly couple came in and were told to \"sit wherever you want\".  The couple chose a table by the window, which they didn't see until they sat down that it was dirty.  When they asked the server to clean the table, she told them to sit \"over there instead\".  They told her that they would prefer to sit by the window.  She cleaned the table, but clearly was annoyed."}
{"text":"The Salmon was dry and almost tasteless. Veggies and sauce had great flavor, the service was nice, just couldn't enjoy the salmon."}
{"text":"Hungry for Thai in the Surprise area, Yelpers directed me to this place. It was busy when we arrived (6:45) and all the inside tables (what we wanted when it is 95 degrees outside) were occupied or dirty. It took a bit until we were seated, then a delay getting menus, and after another delay, we were able to order.   Our appetizers of Fish Cakes and Larb were fine. We have better and worse. While having spent a few seconds too long in the fryer, at least they make their fish cakes in house. The Larb was missing the usual toasted rice; otherwise very tasty.  The entrees, Panang Curry and Drunken Noodles, arrived shortly after the appetizers which caused a bit of a rush to finish the appi's. Both entrée's were what we expected and very tasty. Despit many of the previous reviews, we took a chance and ordered the dishes prepared at the Medium level (choices are none, mild, medium, hot, and Thai hot). That turned out to be a touch cooler than expected, so the spice pots, recommended by others, came in handy.   Overall, the food was good but the service needs improvement. We had three different waitresses handling our table and some confusion occurred. We had to ask for drink refills and even plates so we could share the dishes. Another unusual thing was none of the dishes came with serving utensils. After requesting serving spoons we received chopsticks. Partially the result was due to a language barrier between us and the waitress. The DW and I have no problem using our eating utensil to serve food but it did seem strange.   I would return if we were in the area again, but at a less busy time."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  My newest favorite Thai restaurant in all the lands!  They have a great selection and the friendliest staff to ever live.  I'm also extremely impressed by the fact that this is one of the few Thai restaurants in the Valley that knows what 'Thai hot' means. I've gone to so many Thai restaurants where I've asked for 'Thai hot' and been disappointed with a less than mild flavor.  The boyfriend and I ordered all of our dishes 'Thai hot' because my initial thought was that they're give me something disappointing. Boy was I wrong! That shit was spicy AF... AS F***!! And I mean, I'm Asian, I can handle a hefty amount of spicy in my diet. Holy shit, I couldn't do it, but I was still happy to know that they were brave enough to sell me that plate because even though it was too spicy for me. I was glad they didn't disappoint. We ordered a second round of one of our dishes with no spice added so we would mild out the spicy a little, which made it perfect for us.  Don't be discouraged by my post though. Go try their amazing food!"}
{"text":"The food is superb, the restaurant is tastefully decorated and clean (and I've never had bad service there), and I love supporting a small business in a city overrun by chains and franchises. That being said, I've been scolded twice for ordering delivery outside of their delivery zone. It's really irritating when you drop $40 on a meal plus generous tip and are made to feel like you inconvenienced the business. If you don't want to deliver to certain addresses, then feel free to turn down that order when it's phoned in. What's ridiculous is that I live in Surprise proper, it's not like I'm outside city limits.  That complaint aside, this is the best place to get thai on the west side by far- hence the 4 star rating. Just don't order delivery unless you're within the tiny 3 mile delivery radius."}
{"text":"Really good.   The owner speak Thai so there is a slight language issue on communicating but it is very family oriented   Good idea for a date night."}
{"text":"The food is decent, can't complain about that. I've ordered take-out twice and delivery three times. It's convenient that they deliver because they're the only Thai restaurant in our area to do so. However, there has not been ONE time my order has been correct. Each time I hope to have a better experience and each time it's disappointing. It's incredibly frustrating and I'm done with giving them chances."}
{"text":"Really good food. Extensive menu and prompt service. We had the Royal Shrimp and Green Curry with chicken. Would have liked the food to be served hotter but that's not a deal breaker by any means. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here. It's always tasty and the service is great. I've tried the three fish dish and the green curry. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Tom Yum for lunch today.  It is a cheery little spot with a main dining room with booths on two sides and a bar at the back.  There is also an outside dining area when the weather cools down.  The decor was very pleasant and the service was friendly and efficient.  I ordered the Ginger Angel with Pork.  Lunch specials include soup and an egg roll, with your choice of protein.  I requested \"mild\" which turned out to be very mild.  Next time I'll try medium spicy.  I will also be back to try their soups.  The Thai hot and sour soup looked tempting and they offer a Thai version of Vietnamese Pho which I would also like to try."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here.. (Over priced) The food was okay.. I thought the large soup would be a lot bigger then what we received. I Ordered the drunken noodles with veggies. It didn't taste that great, I wasn't able to finish eating it. My husband ordered pad Thai he said it was good but has had better. I doubt we will be trying this place again."}
{"text":"Ordered Vegetable Pad Thai and a Thai Tea yesterday via the Eat24 delivery option.  I requested no onions on my Pad Thai and also requested it to be \"Thai Hot.\" This was my first time eating Thai food since moving to Arizona just over 5 months ago. I was extremely excited to receive my delivery!  My total bill was $17.00 which included a delivery fee and tip.   When the food and tea reached me, the delivery driver was very courteous. My food was piping hot and the tea was ice cold. No complaints there!  There were a few onions in my meal, I think they may have realized my request a little too late.  Not a big deal, however.   The Vegetable Pad Thai was true to the \"Thai Hot\" label.  It definitely had a kick, and then some.  I love heat, so this was no problem for me.  However about 4 bites in, the bite back was almost too much for me.  I had to stop eating and finish it at a later sitting.  As for the flavor itself, it was pretty consistent with other Thai restaurants I have dined at. Not exceptional, not bad, but good.   The Thai Tea was perfect.  I had tried one in San Diego once and fell in love with it. I was skeptical when I ordered it and was pleasantly surprised when I took my first sip.  Would I eat here again?  Yes.  Would I order the same thing, sure... but I would dial down the heat just a notch. Would I get the Thai Tea? You bet! I recommend it as well.  Happy Yelping!"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow but that doesn't hurt the scoring as much, the lady was very sweet and it was hectic with just the two servers. The food is a little pricey and the meat in my Pingang curry was a little tough. The price paid vs the quality had me score this a little lower. And man, the rating of spicy is high! I can usually handle a 4 like a champ, the 4 here almost made me cry. Tasty but not my top fav."}
{"text":"I actually like this place and would like to give it a higher rating, but I felt like there should be a more inexpensive lunch special.  There is harsh competition out there for lunch.  My pad thai was pretty good, but I didn't really feel like there was any spice to it at all.  I asked for medium. I guess next time I will ask for hot.  The prawns were a decent size.  I do plan on trying them again, for dinner maybe."}
{"text":"Just tried this place tonight with my best friend and it was bomb. The Thai tea was so so yummy. They were friendly. My best friend got red curry and I got yellow curry. Their levels go from 1-6, 6 being the hottest. I got level 3 on the yellow curry and he got 2 on the red curry. His was spicier but I think the red curry is naturally spicier than yellow curry is. Which I never realized before. Both very good but I'm more of a yellow curry kind of girl. That's typically what I get when I get Thai food. I'm typically very picky about my Thai restaurants. I have my favorite but this place is pretty good too! I was very satisfied. A must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and many vegetarian options! The Panang and the Drunken noodles as well as the summer rolls are excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm always a bit suspicious of any restaurant that has to proclaim itself Authentic.    Pleasant decor, reasonable prices are the pluses.    However, the food quality is merely adequate...YMMV and I only have one data point, the pad Thai.  Unfortunately, the sauce in my pad Thai lacked complexity.  But the biggest tell:  no limes.  What authentic Thai restaurant lacks limes?  If you have a yearning for Thai, this place is adequate...don't expect too much, and you won't be disappointed.  The group I was with was more pleased than I, and the ten-year old loved his Thai tea, so maybe I'm just a little extra picky."}
{"text":"I am a fan. I ordered from this place through their online delivery system, which was simple and they accepted PayPal! The food was excellent. We ordered an array of appetizers, pork wontons, shrimp that was wrapped and fried with meat, crab rangoons and then for the finale a broccoli chicken dish. It was all excellent and I would recommend this place, especially considering I don't enjoy many Asian dishes."}
{"text":"This is really a 2.5-2.75 but I didn't want to be misleading with a 3.  All these people who have given a 4 apparently don't eat much Thai food.  This is average at best.  Yellow curry a little sweet but decent, Drunkin noodle tasted like bad Chinese, combo appetizer platter-little bit of a hot mess for $15 but the sauce it came with was good. Sumner rolls are massive!  Advice to Tom Yum, instead of making 2 giant logs, cutting them in half and charging $8, make 2 smaller ones and charge $4.  There is so much lettuce you can hardly taste anything else and they are so big I could barely fit it in my mouth.  I love these types of rolls so I was disappointed at this giant disaster.  Ladies, if you are on a date do not order these.  If you can fit your mouth around one, he may be a little too impressed and you definitely won't look very attractive stuffing this big salad in a rice paper in your mouth.  Delivery person looked like a homeless meth head they pulled off the street and the delivery bags reeked of old dirty cigarette smoke.  BTW it is only 1 mile from the restaurant to my office.  My advice, skip this restaurant, spend less money and go to Panda Express or try a different Thai restaurant with 4 stars cause this one is definitely not a 4."}
{"text":"AMAZING omg the garlic pepper w/ tofu to die for!!!! Just wish it wasn't so far from me..."}
{"text":"I like this place, I especially like that they deliver.  The servings are large & it always tastes fresh.  It tends to take quite a while for delivery, but I enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Soooo good. I've been wanting to try this place for a while. Everything we ordered was delicious. We ordered the Coconut soup (Tom Kuh). The presentation was excellent. The taste was amazing! The service was great. They were very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, order the tom Kah coconut soup and you will be in heaven. They also have some of the best house fried rice I have ever had! They cater to vegetarians and meat eaters alike and they deliver! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This place replaced one of my lunch spots, an old Rubio's restaurant. It is located next to one of the sushi places I hit every week, Fresh Wasabi, so I was excited when I saw this Thai place make its way in.  I didn't eat here, but I took food to go on a lunch break. There's a rating scale ranging from mild to medium to spicy and Thai spicy. I'm not used to seeing the actual red chili flakes, but with both dishes I ordered, it looked like red confetti sprinkled over everything. Just interesting observation though - not a deal maker or breaker for that matter. Like I said, the sprinkled red chili flakes made food look like confetti-inspired fun, perhaps?   Tom Ka soup with added shrimp - very good. I ordered this medium and the sweetness of the coconut milk really complimented the spiciness of the soup. However, the medium is not as spicy as the medium at one of my other favorite Thai places, Satara. The shrimp was cooked well - I often worry that places overcook shrimp to the point of chewy-ness, but Tom Yum's shrimp was done still tender yet cooked.   Yellow curry with chicken. - Cooked really well. The sauce is thinner but very close to the thickness I look for in my curries. I like my curry sauces on the extra thick, rich side. (Might as go \"all out\" when going unhealthy, right?) The taste was very enjoyable and flavorful.   I was put on hold for what seemed like 10 minutes listening to their background noise when ordering over the phone. It was around lunch time though, so I understand they were extra busy. I worried for them thinking, what if they put other people on hold this long too? I almost hung up and was going to try again another time when the girl finally picked up and was able to take my order. That was my only minor gripe. Otherwise, I definitely will return here.  I love Thai food, and I'm glad that this location is so convenient to get to in Surprise."}
{"text":"Yay! Finally excellent Thai food in Surprise. Extensive menu, wonderful special entrees and reasonable prices. The servers are the same people all the time and they know what they are doing. Also very nice folks. We sometimes come with a very large crowd and our dinners still come out of the kitchen fairly quickly and more or less together. The dishes are also consistently prepared. There seem to be no good nights vs. bad nights. Always good every time. The soups  are also really good and there are no unidentifiable thingys floating around in them like the Vietnamese restaurant down the block. We keep coming back here and trying new dishes all the time. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner at Tom Yum this evening because I had a craving for Thai food and remembered this place had opened recently, so we decided to try it.  When we got in there the 'hostess' told us that we could sit where we wanted (from across the room), but this didn't bother me as she was on her way to put an order in to the kitchen. Our server was very friendly and informed me as I received my soda that earlier in the week the regular and diet syrups were mixed up so if it tasted off to let her know... She comped the soda for me.  We were having a hard time picking what we wanted to try, so we ordered the Chicken Satay as an appetizer before we placed our entree order.  The appetizer came out right as we were ordering our entrees (very quick).  I ordered the Broccoli Noodles with Beef, medium heat and my husband ordered the Pad Thai Noodles with Mixed Meat, medium heat.  It took longer than I had expected to get the food since we were one of three tables, but we were there fairly late and it seemed there there were only one or two people in the kitchen.  When we received our food we were blown away at how great it tasted!!  Both the appetizer and our entrees were phenomenal.  Perfect amount of spiciness, temperature of food, consistency of noodles, texture and taste of meat, etc.  Everything was perfect.  Our server was very attentive throughout the entire meal.  All in all, Tom Yum surpassed my expectations and we will definitely be returning soon, and often, to enjoy delicious Thai food."}
{"text":"Great Thai in Surprise. The mango sticky rice will change your life. Clean and friendly inside, quick delivery. Had a few mishaps with delivery but they fix it with either a correction or credit."}
{"text":"So happy to have a local Thai restaurant! Gave it a try and have enjoyed it four times in the  last month. Have tried the yellow,  green and red curries, drunken noodles,  pad thai, and summer rolls. Have not had a bad meal. Enjoying exploring the menu, and finding lots of new favorites!"}
{"text":"When I discovered Tom Yum, we were going on day 9 of being sick. I mean sick. You're not sick for 9 days with a cold. We got visited by all manner of evil Tom Yum was the shining beam of light in the darkness of night.   I stopped at Tom Yum for some take-out after stopping at WalMart for more cold/flu remedies. At this point, my smell and taste capabilities had diminished to well below 20%. Everything we were eating tasted bland. And we were looking for some relief. We got it at Tom Yum.   We love Satara, and that has been our go-to place for Thai food in the West Valley, so Tom Yum had its work cut out for it. When we eat Thai, we always order the same thing first time in in order to give ourselves a solid baseline for quality. We get Pad Thai, medium heat, as the noodles tend to carry heat, and we order Yellow Curry, Thai hot. For this special occasion, we threw in an order of Tom Yum soup with chicken, extra hot.   Our bill came to $32 and change. For lunch. A little steep, me thinks, but the value was there. It was damn good. Good enough to go back the next day for more Tom Yum. It is THE BEST soup I've ever had. But it's $10 a quart. That one is tough to wrap my mind around.   The staff is extremely friendly, but still working kinks out. It seems they're trying to figure out their clientele. They said that take out orders far exceed dine in orders, but there's nothing about the dining room that's not inviting.   Overall, this is a quality experience. A little pricey, and that's why it's not a 5, but overall, very good, and an easy stand-in for Satara.  **With Satara now CLOSED, this is our go-to Thai spot.**"}
{"text":"Thai good can't get any better here.very neat atmosphere.good music. I would warn you though potions are huge and will fill you. Also If you are big on non oily food you'd better ask for less oil in fried noodles!"}
{"text":"Service was great, place was clean. Forgot to ask if they add MSG... flavors and food tasted great, but was so thirsty for the rest of day"}
{"text":"Had the green chicken curry, medium.  Pretty spicy.  The curry was good.  Plenty of chicken!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I ordered the noodle beef stew but was kinda bland so I switched it or the yellow curry. Omg the curry was fantastic. Waitress was nice. No issues with switching meal either. Little pricey over but good food over all."}
{"text":"My daughter surprised us with lunch. What started out to be a nice turn out terrible. The food was terrible. The rice was hard and dry, and the spring rolls were like rubber, the sweet and sour chicken was ok. I called to let them know how disappointed we were, they insisted we try something different. Reluctantly, I agreed. After hanging up with me they called my daughter and told her, the card she used would be charged another fee to deliver. My daughter opted just to be credited the entire amount back. After arguing with my daughter they agreed to the credit, and just hung up on my daughter. Now just waiting to see if the credit goes through. I will not ever go here again. And everyone I know will hear about the bad food and being treated so rudely.   They certainly deserve a negative rating -stars"}
{"text":"Delicious food, we have come here for lunch and dinner and they never disappoint. Plus, you never wait for a table and get to enjoy meal faster."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Thai food.  We have eaten at many of the Thai restaurants in the Phoenix area.  We were so happy to see a Thai restaurant opening in Surprise.  We eagerly awaited the day we could try it out and had the greatest of expectations for it, as we had peered in the windows before it opened and thought that the place looked nice.  Well, it looked nice, but we have had anything but a good experience eating here.  We have now been to this restaurant twice, hoping that the first bad experience was just \"grand opening pains\".  Unfortunately, it is not.  We went the end of the second week after its opening.  The food was decent, but the service was terrible.  Very slow, and very disorganized.  It seemed to take forever before anyone came to our table after we sat down.  Eventually, we ordered our drinks, an appetizer, and our main courses.  Our main courses were eventually brought to the table, only to have the appetizer follow the serving of our main courses.  When we pointed this out, they took our main courses away, and left the appetizer.  I told them I did not want my food brought back to the table cold, but when it was brought back (after we finished the appetizer), it was anything but hot.  It took an act of congress to get a drink refill.    Okay, we thought.  It is just grand opening problems.  We'll try it again sometime in the future.  That future was today.  Plenty of time for them to iron out their problems.  My wife and I went to the restaurant with a friend.  We were not greeted when we came in the restaurant, and a customer looked up at us and told us to just sit where we want.  So now the customers are giving other customers advise as to where to sit.  How lovely.  Never mind, we found a table and sat down.  We were given menus right away and a man took our drink order.  We then sat there for a good 15 minutes waiting for someone to take our food order.  We spotted a waitress who sat a couple down, immediately took their drink order, then immediately took their appetizer order, and I finally stopped her when she brought out the other tables appetizer.  It was obvious from the way she talked with this other couple that they were regulars.  I guess being not a regular, we didn't seem to matter.  Okay, so we gave her our orders.    My wife and I ordered the same dish, hers completely mild, and mine with medium heat.  Our friend placed his order.  After about 10 minutes, the waitress brought out my friends order and took my drink away asking what I would like in my refill.  My friend began eating, and I anticipated our order would be out within seconds.  After he had finished about a quarter of his meal, I saw our waitress with two dishes sitting up on the counter, and she was preparing take out orders.  We didn't have our food, and I never got my drink.  After a bit, i was beginning to get very annoyed, and I finally got up and asked what was going on.  Turns out that the food that was sitting on the counters for a long while were OUR orders.  She brought them over, then went and got me my drink.  This was a bit much.  Our food was anything was hot...in fact it was room temp, but I was sure not going to send it back.  i was already upset.  A man came over and told me that he would frank one of our meals.  I could care less about that....I just wanted my food and decent service.  Now here comes the cherry on the top.  My wife's meal was as spicy as mine.  They obviously didn't prepare hers mild, just made them both up in the same wok and what they make is what you get.  To top it off, the very last bite of chicken I put in my mouth I spit out as it was almost RAW.  I wanted to throw up.  AVOID THIS RESTAURANT.  You have been warned.  i wouldn't go back if the food was free.    Granted, I don't often write to Yelp about places I like, but I hardly have ever written to complain either.  For me to do this write up, you know it is bad."}
{"text":"Ordered my food and I was really worried it would be late based on some of the reviews. I requested 11:15 delivery and it was here within 5 minutes of that time, which was awesome! I ordered yellow curry mild and I will most definitely get medium or hot next time. Not spicy in the slighter and I think that will really help compliment the sweetness to this dish. I also ordered the crab ragoons and the Thai sweet tea. Rangoons were so so yummy and still pretty hot when they were delivered which is the best way to eat them.(cold rangoons are weird) the Thai tea was like creamy sweet tea, I think the tea might have been old from the night before or they need to clean out whatever they keep it in cause it just tasted a bit stale. Still a complete 5 star because this was my first time ordering from this place and it exceeded my expectations 10 times over."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here last night around 4:30-4:45 via the Yelp app. I only ordered two things: chicken pad thai (specifically asked for NO PEANUTS even though they were not listed on the item description) and spicy basil chicken (paid $1.00 extra for brown rice). I chose these options during checkout and wrote the special requests in the instruction box as well. The estimated delivery time was 60-75 minutes, which was fine even though we were extremely hungry. Our car broke down on our way back to Cali and was in the shop so we couldn't really leave. There was nothing in walking distance either.  About an hour later we get a call from the delivery driver asking what floor we were on and our room number so he could bring the food up. I had already written this info in the instructions but okay.  My boyfriend answered the door and takes the food from someone that he states is dressed like a \"bum\" and definitely does not look like he should be delivering food. I laugh it off because I'm so hungry that I don't even care.  We open the single bag of food only to discover there are no forks and no napkins. I then open the containers of food to find peanuts on the pad thai (I specifically asked for no peanuts), which looks like it was sitting for 20 minutes before even being driven to us. The noodles were dry and hard. I open the small container to discover white rice, not even the brown rice that I had paid extra for. The container of spicy basil chicken was the only thing still hot and that had flavor, but was sitting in a pool of really oily sauce.  At this point I'm upset because we had to go downstairs and get silverware from the front desk before being able to even eat our already cold Thai food.  During this time I called the restaurant to complain because I really think that everything that went wrong in our order is actually so simple to get right that there are no excuses for this kind of mishap.  I spoke with a young man with poor customer service skills, he didn't seem like he even knew what to say. I explained everything that was wrong with the order and never once did I receive an apology. I mentioned there was no plastic forks in the bag and the young man on the phone says \"Did you want me to bring you forks\". Now, I'm pretty reasonable and said no because I can get them downstairs but the fact of the matter is I shouldn't have to. I requested a refund and I believe he passed the phone to someone else who sounded just as young and confused. I asked if I was speaking with a manager and he said \"oh no, I guess not\". I requested a refund again and he explained I would have to go through Yelp and their delivery service in order to get one.   I believe Yelp uses \"EatStreet\" so I called their customer service department and was helped promptly and immediately. I explained everything that had happened and the young woman I spoke with was extremely apologetic and gave me a full refund for the food. She was the only person who offered any sort of solution to the problem. I will continue to use delivery services through Yelp thanks to EatStreet but never again from Tom Yum Thai.   *This review is mainly for their delivery and customer service via phone. Why offer delivery if you can't even properly deliver?"}
{"text":"Between this place and the Vietnamese restaurant I prefer the food here. More flavorful, more variety, tastes more authentic. Soups are excellent. I usually get the drunken noodles but all dishes I've had have been great. I approve!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! We order through the GrubHub app it's fast, easy and convenient. The only thing I wish they had was some type of Thai bread to add for the curry."}
{"text":"I had been literally starving for Thai and went with the yelp reviews. Charming outside setting & pleasant servers. The angel wings in appetizers lacked flavor, crab puffs lacked crab and the mild to medium glass noodle salad was not eatable so spicy. Did have 3 small shrimps. Waitress kindly offered to replace with no spice, asked if I wanted shrimps which I refused. The replacement salad had no taste so left it. Two stars for gracious servers. Others diners commented on the overwhelming spicy dishes. They automatically added a 25% tip on my bill because we were 7: if you know Thai food: stay away. If you don't know Thai food, you won't learn there what you have been missing."}
{"text":"Over two and a half hours waiting for a delivery, called multiple times asking them for an ETA only said \"he's on the way I didn't ask him where he was\" I called twice asking for an ETA."}
{"text":"Just ok thai place had dinner yesterday.  Ordered thai iced tea asked for 1/2 inch of creme on top. Got 2 or 3 inches.   Salad rolls 8.   Nothing in them but rice and lettuce maybe a tiny bit of protein.  Had curry asked for basil added not much flavor.  Phad Thai was decent.    Restaurant was slow lots of help my third or fourth time there.   Going to find a better Thai restaurant no consistency here."}
{"text":"Drunken noodles are absolutely amazing.  Don't miss the patio along the side - quiet with plenty of shade.  Recommend the drunken noodles. The lunch specials are great with the added soup and spring roll.  The staff is friendly and eager to help answer any and all questions about the menu and different curry's.  Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Glad to have them here in Surprise, I dropped in for lunch on the run a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed my meal.  I had the green beans with chicken, it was very tasty, cooked well.  I loved the veggie soup !! The brown rice was rock hard, so I had to send it back, seemed way old and left out, but the white they replaced it with was heavenly, fresh, fragrant, amazing!"}
{"text":"Very great atmosphere, Tom Kah was a little bland. The spice scale tonight was a bit lower than what I'm used to but the  Spicy Green Bean Pork dish on their menu is the absolute bomb.com. great service, very clean and reasonable priced."}
{"text":"I have to write this place was a total surprise to me in terms of its service and quality of food. Here we were, at Sun City West where the blue hair crowd was driving golf carts on the streets to get around.  Understandably then, my expectation to find a tasty Thai restaurant was low.  Imagine my raised eye brows when we opened the door to a pleasantly decorated and clean interior. Most importantly, the smell of the Thai food was mouth watering delicious!!! The place was crowded and everyone's plate looked fantastic that before I sat down, I became excited to eat there.  We ended up ordering the green curry and it was creamy, rich, full of flavor and out of this world!!! I promptly forgot my no rice rule and mixed the green curry with my rice and it was soooo good!!!! If you are ever in the area and are looking for a place to eat, this place is highly recommended!!!!  Yum, finger licking, bowl licking clean good!  Yup, it's that good!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I don't like Asian food....BUT Thai food (at the right restaurant) is awesome. If you're not sure what to get and is kind of skeptical about Asian food, try the Drunken Fried Rice. That's what I always get. It is seasoned just right with a slight sweet taste.  I go all the time!"}
{"text":"I eat here and my other half does not eat Thai food and will bring something for another place and they are ok with it. They have indoor and outdoor seating.   They have always been nice and have great food."}
{"text":"My aunt Patti raved and raved about this place.  Was in the area visiting with her and decided to take her out to dinner.  She said they have the best Pad Thai ever!  Personally I am not a big fan of Pad Thai.  It's like the gringo standard thai food dish, no what I mean.  Kind of bland and not very adventurous.  Anyway, we went and I asked her what else she liked.  Turns out (not surprisingly) that she had never ordered anything other than the Pad Thai.  Well, now's the time to branch out girl!  We ordered the spicy green bean with chicken choosing it to be Thai Hot since we like spicy.  It was great!  She had to get a plate of Pad Thai of course (also Thai Hot) but chose white fish.  It was pretty good!  I was surprised in Surprise AZ.  LOL.  The stand out dish however was the chicken Larb salad.  It was fresh, light, spicy and just the right amount of meat and salad to be absolutely perfect.  The service was fast and efficient.  Our waitress was very personably and friendly.  We closed the place down practically and the owner came out and spoke with us as well as packed up our left overs.  She was super sweet and made for a nice end of the meal.  Definitely will be dropping in again next time I visit Surprise."}
{"text":"this is one of those reviews that if I could give 0 stars I would.. this was Sunday night 10/25/2015 at 6:15pm. this was our first visit and after reading the reviews here we felt pretty comfortable that we were going to have a good experience.   Initial impression: When we arrived no one was available to seat us. after a couple of minutes Kevin saw us and asked us if we wanted a table for two. we said yes. he said he would get a table ready for us (there were many open tables) he walked over to a table right by the door where we were and took their bill and payment and left us standing at the doorway. another couple of minutes go by while he is having a conversation with someone behind the bar area. a female waitress comes in from the outside. sees us.. greets us and tells us to sit wherever we would like. (should have left then but okay)  Ordering: so we have a seat. we'd already looked at the menu online so we already kinda knew what we wanted. after about 5 minutes Kevin came over and took our drink order. we said we were ready to order and ordered crab Rangoon and we both ordered Ginger Fantasy.. I now know why they call it fantasy.. you get to fantasize about eating it for an hour. Kevin asked if we wanted the crab Rangoon before our meal which we said yes.   Getting your order: a few minutes later we get our drinks. we've now been in the place for 10 minutes and just getting drinks. after about 5 minutes we see another couple who were there when we got there get up and leave. they apparently didn't even have a drink order taken yet. the lady sitting by the door left about the time we placed our order. 25 minutes go by and the table the lady was siting at is still not cleaned off. we have seen about 6 people come in to pick up to go orders. we are now in the place 35 minutes and the crab Rangoon makes it to our table. I was actually just getting up from my seat to leave when he brought them out. around this time 2 other couples came in and were seated. The crab rangoon was barely warm.. which means its been sitting there at least 5 if not 10 minutes. it takes a while for a fried food to get that cold.  During this time we had a table of 2 behind us that were talking really loud about throwing up and some co-worker who was gay and had a lesbian lover. very loud and obnoxious. They finally left about 10 minutes later. after being here for 45 minutes the dirty table is finally cleaned off.   Still waiting for our actual meal. so we've now been in the place an hour.. no one has said anything about our order and the 2 couples who came in 25 minutes ago have their food. we ask our waiter for the bill for what we have had so we can leave. we go to the counter and my wife complains about the level of service and taking an hour to get a meal. She asks him to hurry up as he has already wasted enough of our time. Kevin turns around and begins to get smart mouthed with her and said \"I'm doing it look you can see i'm ringing up your order\" my wife says well it's about the only thing I've seen you do so far. he then argues with her about how busy he has been and how much he has been doing. she turns and walks away. at that point someone else was maybe the one in charge tonight called kevin back. I asked Kevin if he was seriously arguing with a customer who just waited an hour to get a meal and still didn't get it. left and will not return."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!! We tried the panang pork and larb chicken. So yummy!! The place is adorable and the staff is very friendly. We will be back! (I need to try the coconut ice cream) :)"}
{"text":"Another beautiful day in AZ so my two year old and I decided to sit in the patio area.  I was craving pad thai and this place didn't didn't disappoint at all.  The pad thai was delicious!  We also ordered wontons as an appetizer and I wish they had a little bit more meat in them, but the sauce was tasty and my son loved them so that's all that matters.  Service was amazing and they catered to my son so well.  Definitely will go back to eat here."}
{"text":"I went for the first time today. I ordered the Pad Thai lunch combo with pork. It was very tasty! The service was good and so were the spring rolls and soup they served as an appetizer. The restaurant was clean and had pleasant music playing in the background.  I will certainly be back. I was very satisfied with my experience."}
{"text":"First time here ordered wonton soup that didn't look anything like wonton soup. I paid 13$ for dry meat soup basically. I ordered pad Thai which was just ok. The restaurant is nice and quaint and ppl were friendly but food was not up to standard. Unfortunately,  I wasted a trip and money. I was so excited to eat here I love Thai food, normally."}
{"text":"I love that I can order delivery right through the Yelp app! And I don't have to deal with the BS that is currently Grand and Bell. My only qualm is that their Thai Hot is quite mild. I'll just order double Thai Hot next time. ;)"}
{"text":"On our second time eating at Tom Yum we had a very disappointing experience.  It was about 5:45 and the restaurant was not busy.  There were 3 of us ordering.  My husband got has meal first.  After a long wait my mother got her food.  My husband was over half way done with his meal before my meal was brought to the table.  When I looked at it I thought it did not seem to be what I ordered.  It was loaded with bean sprouts and my meal was supposed to have broccoli and no bean sprouts..  I looked at the menu and was sure it was wrong.  When we told the waitress she said they must have mixed up the order and would cook the right dish. So I sat and waited again. We were charged for my meal even though the other 2 diners at my table were finished before my food ever came.   I noticed at other tables people received their meals at different times too.. The whole experience was very poorly handled by the kitchen and servers."}
{"text":"This place is straight fire. My friend and I arrived pretty late and the restaurant was pretty empty but I am pretty sure it was only empty because of the time! I ordered Pad Kee Mow (Drunken Noodle) and my friend ordered Tom Yum with noodle. There was 5 different levels for how spicy the Pad Kee Mow could be (DAMN!). Being the spice lover that I am, I decided to go with the level 4, Thai Hot. Boy...do I regret choosing this spice level because I literally had water for dinner. The food was so good though. I will for sure be back but probably order my dish in Medium because this place is authentic!"}
{"text":"Not much outstanding at this restaurant. Vegetables in any of the dishes did not appear to be fresh and were instead frozen, or out of a can. Pad Thai was one of the \"sweetest\" Pad's I've ever had and just didn't  have that fresh taste that most authentic Thai restaurants have. Chicken in the dishes was chewy, with \"crunchy\" things attached to it and that really turned us off big time. Ordered the red curry, the peanut dishes and one there dish and all three of the sauces tasted exactly the same. Not alot of imagination went into the dishes so if you've never had Thai before it might be enjoyable for you, but if you love Thai and expect it to be fresh and full of flavour, then prepare to be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Sat down and took a long time to even get noticed. Even longer to get a drink order in. Service is very slow. I would NOT come here if you are one a time crunch! The place was packed at lunch time.  Ordered the shrimp Pad Thai lunch special and it was good. The sauce had a hint of BBQ flavor to it, which I thought was different.  No drink refills ever came, we were never even offered any. In fact no one ever came by to even make sure the order was correct or to see if we needed anything. Took forever to get our bill. Over all, Service was the downfall. I may come back some day, but there are a lot of other places out there waiting to be tapped into first."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place last time so this time calls for a review! So let's start from the top.  Found parking easily in front of the restaurant. Nice sign that pops out in the plaza. Found seating as soon as we walked in. Employees were nice and attentive. The red curry with chicken was as good as I remember. I chose medium spice and added a lot of chili oil! Pad see ew noodles were cooked perfectly and the beef on it was tender! Spicy eggplant with beef had very savory sauce. And the Tom Yum soup was fire! A beautiful mix of hot and sourness. From all the food that was tasted I would recommend them all! If you like Thai food, then give this place a go. if you haven't had Thai food, I would tell you to give it a try.. variety is the spice of life, so let's season it up!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Thai food....like a lot. The Hawaiian fried rice had the option of chicken and shrimp ...I just wanted vegetables, it tasted nothing of fried rice and exactly like a piece of shrimp. The wok bowl I got wasn't impressive either!"}
{"text":"I've been craving some pad Thai and Thai tea these past couple weeks. I normally order take out and pick it up on the way to work. I always loved going here, but I called last week, rang forever with no answer. I didn't have much time so I decided to just get it another day. Today, I called 3 times, which just kept ringing and ringing without an end. I was frustrated, but maybe their phones weren't working. Technology, I understand. So I drove there, and I decided to call the phone number written on their door- maybe I called the wrong number. I walked in as I was dialing. Their phone started ringing and ringing- I saw two ladies and one of them walked by, looked at it, and didn't pick it up. WOW! First time I've ever seen that happen in real life. So I walked out. There's SO many other food places around here waiting to take my money. I called 4 other times just now to talk to someone and still no one answered and the last two times the call actually ended on me. I'm so disappointed in this place now. The people that use to work here I haven't seen. And really? What's a phone for if you're not going to answer it? Goodbye pad Thai and Thai tea. I'll find you elsewhere. Like down the street."}
{"text":"I love this place for Thai food when I am in surprise. My favorite is the yellow curry. Just be careful their food can be very spicy, I usually like medium to hot spice and here the mild is still very spicy."}
{"text":"Food has gotten better! The curries are better, I'm not sure if they got someone new in the kitchen or just started to get better ingredients. I tried it out a few weeks ago and it's considerably better! Good job!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery when I was sick and it was delicious! Wonton soup was full of fresh vegetables and homemade wontons in a spicy broth. Only wish they offered egg rolls - not a fan of spring rolls - I prefer a wonton wrapper. One regret is not getting the heat level a little hotter and will dine in next time."}
{"text":"Each dish is made one at a time. Not a fast food place vut a dining experience as you wait for your food.  Staff is awesome. The frozen coffee is much better than Starbucks."}
{"text":"Took out a bunch of appetizers, pad thai, drunken noodles and the papaya salad. All fantastic."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I order from Tom Yum at least once a week, sometimes twice a week. They deliver and we love it. They are quick and they have never gotten an order wrong."}
{"text":"I've had their food delivered several times (4-5) and they haven't disappointed. Orders have been accurate and the food has been absolutely delicious. I live probably on the border of their delivery area so it might take a little longer than usual to arrive, but it hasn't been a problem. Driver has been consistent and friendly and the food is hot. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great Thai food! We had the yellow curry with white fish, drunken rice, pad Thai with shrimp and duck with ginger angel. Would highly recommend this place! Nice ambience and good service. Thai tea was delicious!"}
{"text":"Probably best Thai food on this side of town. I got the drunken noodles with shrimp (Thai hot). My coworker got the basil with calamari. We were both pleasantly surprised at the high quality of the food. It's close to my job, so I'll be back for lunch without a doubt. Thank you Tom Yum for giving me a good Thai spot nearby"}
{"text":"Ordered the pad Thai with tofu and it was decent. Not too impressive but wasn't completely disgusting. It was for about $10. I was kind of sick of American food so that was the Asian place closest to my location. Overall it was ok."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant last week and the food is fantastic. Being that they just opened, the staff was a little slow and forgot little things like the spring rolls for the lunch items. However, the food more than made up for this. I ordered the coconut curry soup. I don't think they could have done any better, and I know it was some of the best coconut curry soup I have had. I then proceeded to order my main dish, and although I did not see the noodle and sauce combination I wanted to order, the staff was more than willing to create a new item for me #16 lunch combo. :) I would HIGHLY recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Had the Drunken noodles with chicken, beef chow mein, and veggie delight. Food is great and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Thank God for this place because so many restaurants in Surprise suck.  When my wife and I go out for dinner, we usually go to another city because we are so tired of the same old cookie cutter chain restaurants, where all the food all comes from the same distributor regardless of whatever restaurant you are at.  This place is the exception.  My wife and I tried this place sort of haphazardly and much to our surprise the food was excellent.  Its traditional Thai prepared in way that Americans will enjoy.  The coconut soup and the yellow curry chicken is my main staple here.  The restaurant itself isn't much to write home about as it is a bit drab inside and at times it seems a little dirty, but the quality of food I typically receive offsets any concerns that I have in that regard.  I will warn you, the time it takes to get your food takes a little longer than your normal premade out of the box food you get everywhere else in this town, but that is because it is being made from scratch.  This isn't Panda Express.  Be patient...it will be worth it.  The place offers an outside patio which isn't anything fancy, but still it's nice to sit outside everyone once in a while when the weather is cool.  One thing that is a little annoying about this place is the strange wooden Thai lady who continuously peaks over your booth to watch you eat.  Awkward!  Also, apparently they no longer serve real coconut ice cream here anymore.  The stuff you get is the coconut flavored ice-cream you get at the grocery stores.  Pass on this item as it is not very good.  Overall, I give Tom Yum a whopping four stars for food quality and location convenience."}
{"text":"Great, amazing, delicious Thai food....but knocked them down a star because of the slow service. We will just use them for take out. Wonderful flavor, spice and selection. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Check your takeout order before you leave! I called and ordered cashew nuts and shrimp with brown rice, mild. What did I get? Cashew nuts with chicken, extra spicy,  and white rice. I took a few bites, but it was way too hot for me, so I tossed it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with different friends and always forget to write a review this service is great the food is amazing always consistent I am very particular about my food and this is probably one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to in a long time! Great place for a date night and nice dinner a quick lunch or even a pick up order!   Try any of the curries they are amazing the whole menu rocks and then make sure you save room for dessert it's the sticky rice with mango which rocks! Sorry I don't have any pics"}
{"text":"Delicious! We loved the curry and Thai spice. We thought we would get more seafood/meat per dish, but it was still good. Flavors were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Decided to try something new for date night so we stopped in. It was very busy, but we were seated immediately. I order Pho. It was not the worst I've had, but too sweet for my taste. I was looking for a more spicy Pho . Great waitress and appetizers though."}
{"text":"Pad thai chicken is the bomb!! I love this dish. You get a good amount for the price. I want to try more dishes here. I have also tried the shrimp rice and the shrimp pad thai and they are good too.  When you eat in, there is a server there by the name of Ana and she is very nice. Excellent customer service and very pleasant to have as a server."}
{"text":"Tom Yum is my favorite Thai restaurant in the valley. They open at 10am so if you're craving something savory before noon they're available. They are also willing to customize pretty much everything on their menu. I love their vegetarian mock chicken and you can get it in any of their entrees. My two favorite dishes are the broccoli noodles with mock chicken and the Masaman curry with tofu. They also customize the spice level to your palate. In addition to fabulous food, they have great service and the servers quickly get to know you and remember your favorite dishes and drink preferences. One of the places I always take out of town guests to."}
{"text":"I crave this place often and that is not common for me.  The Staff(which for me is usually a reflection on the food experience as well) is so sweet and helpful with suggesting new things.  I have tried all the Curries(Green, Yellow, Red, Panang, Massaman), I favor the Red, especially here  is creamy, rich and mild or medium is wonderfully spicy. Pad Thai - AMAZING, Thai Tea - Yummy & Creamy, Sticky Rice, Fried Banana, & Coconut Ice Cream - Wonderful, Ginger Angel & (all) Fried Rice(s) - Superb. Restaurant & Bathroom are clean. Almost always space to be seated right away. Inside & Patio seating. Stay quick for lunch or linger over dinner and conversation, this is the Thai place to come in the NW Valley. I had been new to Thai food until about two years ago (while visiting in CA), sad I know! From my first bite I was hooked, but Remember I was in CA! Imagine my happiness when I found a local place that was amazing! I am a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Finally, Thai food in Surprise!  As a first time visit, my experience was OK, but not mind-blowing. Good enough for me to want to come back.   Having lived in Thailand, I know what to expect in terms of heat, flavor, ingredients and amount. My grandma and I ordered the Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) with shrimp and the Yellow Curry with Chicken.  Pad Kee Mao: -not nearly enough wide noodles -odd addition of red bell peppers, but still tasty -veggies nicely cooked through without being limp -awesome flavor  Yellow Curry: -OK flavor, coconut milk seemed like it may have gone bad -potatoes not cooked all the way through -one small serving of rice, did not have enough to get through the dish  Our server was very polite, but the place was oddly quiet and seemed empty, even with four other tables in the restaurant. Dishes took a little longer than expected, hope to see the service pick up and the atmosphere morph into something a little more lively. Can't wait to try takeout sometime...."}
{"text":"Finally a Thai restaurant in Surprise, Az! We came the day this restaurant opened, and went back the next day as well. Great authentic Thai food, friendly atmosphere, can't go wrong plus they deliver within a 3 mile radius!"}
{"text":"During a recent visit to Phoenix, I stopped here for dinner.  I ordered the Drunken Noodles with chicken.  Tremendous flavors, fresh ingredients, and fast, friendly service.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!  Clean and quaint. Food was spot on. Could tell the chef took pride in his food preparation.  If I lived in Surprise I would be a regular diner."}
{"text":"Delicious yellow curry meal with chicken and the other person enjoyed pad thai. Spiciness of 2 worked! Loved the Thai iced tea; no room for dessert."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!  Been coming here since they opened.  Staff is super friendly and food is wonderful.  The only suggestion I have is that if you want a medium spicy then, have them put it on the side and you can add as needed.  Their homemade sweet and sour sauce it AMAZING that comes with their spring rolls, which, by the way are amazing as well!  Love those little suckers...lol  Otherwise, everything I have tried on the menu has been very good.  If its not, then they will make it right.  Nice place to go for lunch, etc.  Small dining area, but it makes it kind of cozy."}
{"text":"Walked in, waited 5 mins.  Waitress saw me.   Waited 5 mins.  waitress saw me  waited 5 mins.   then left."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food, very authentic & I have family from Northern Thailand, so I know what authentic Thai tastes like. Definitely recommend this place for delicious Thai food."}
{"text":"This review is about service not food. I can't review the food because I didn't get any. Went tonight and disagreed about where to sit with a young lady. She wanted me to sit at a 2 person booth around the side. I am claustrophobic and since I was dining alone and reading I needed more room. The young lady brought me water and then left me alone. I sat there for over 10 minutes. Three other groups of people came in after me. Sat there so more and then they waited on another group who came in behind me. They busy but overly so. After that I decided I would go somewhere else who wanted my business and money.  I come out every year for three months to visit my mom and eat out quite a bit. This restaurant has lost a lot of business from me."}
{"text":"I really want to give it 5 stars but, someone's order gets messed up each of the times that we've been here so, knocking off one start just for that.  A couple times I've even overheard another table use the phrase 'this isn't what I ordered.'  Once we get the food, it's really good, even if it's not what was ordered.  (Unless it's inedible, I won't send it back.)  I have tried a couple of the curry dishes and the Pad Thai and enjoyed each of them all the same.  When they ask for spice, don't be afraid to go hot, it's recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent. It's been a couple years since I've had a place to go for good Thai and I am so happy to find this here in my new home town of Surprise."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly srvers. Food was predictable but tasty, so no complaints !!! Makes for a good experience. The thai iced tea was great. I would definitely visit again :)"}
{"text":"The panang curry here is absolutely to die for. The staff is friendly and delivery is really fast as well. This has quickly become my go-to stop for curry, I always know it'll be top notch!"}
{"text":"Before I share our dining experience I want to call out Yelp! I travel extensively for my job, and Yelp is my go-to app for finding the best meals nearby. Yesterday's meal - #epicfail While scouring the pages for a gustatory delight, Tom Yum was near the top of the list. I kept seeing review after review of four stars. I now know to take that wit a grain of salt. Had I kept looking for the \"not-recommended reviews\" on a later page, the \"really, don't bother reviews\" were hidden away. To be fair, Saigon Kitchen was recommended but there would have been a 45 minute wait. Carrabas was across the parking lot. Same story. So we called Tom Yum to see if they were busy. The person who answered the phone said they were, but we could get a table. We stated that we would be there in five minutes. I can state that the serving staff was very nice. And the Thai Ice Tea was yummy. But we came to eat.  I ordered Broccoli Delight with BBQ pork. It wasn't. The pork was overcooked. After one bite I called our waitress over. She happily took the plate to replace the pork with beef. I think I also need to say that three of us were dining, but only one received his meal in a semi-timely fashion. But mine was next and I was quite peckish. The beef was overcooked! and the lovely broccoli dish that looked so pretty previously was covered in carrots. I detest cooked carrots. No way for them to know that but the meal was not advertised as Carrot Delight.  The third person in our party ordered Garlic & Black Pepper Shrimp. I had contemplated that dish as well but I can live without frozen seafood. Her dish came much later and to her chagrin didn't contain Black pepper. Seriously. It had chili peppers. She sent it back. Again the waitress was very nice. When she returned the dish did contain black pepper but my friend said it was pretty much tasteless. To be fair the third person in our party enjoyed his   We hadn't even left when an unsettled feeling settled in my stomach.  Thai is my favorite cuisine and I pushed for us to dine here. I was just in Thailand a few months ago and the food was superb. I wasn't expecting a comparable meal. Just a decent one.  I have been in other parts of the country where fast food was given four stars. Really don't want to go down this path with Yelp."}
{"text":"The food here was very good. I've been to many Thai restaurants in other states and was not expecting to find one here in Arizona. But the food was amazing. Very flavorful and authentic. I suggest you try a little of everything, because all the dishes have a very unique flavor. The waitresses here are extremely nice and helpful also."}
{"text":"I definitely love good Thai food and this place is right by where I work.  The staff are very friendly and quick which is important for a lunch spot.  Tom Kha (sp?) soup here is awesome and they have great lunch deals including free side soup and spring roll.  Very good overall."}
{"text":"'Hot and sour' soup on this menu is my favorite soup of all time now! Love the sweet, salty, spicy flavors and cilantro. Been here twice and enjoyed both visits. I did have Pad Thai the first visit, but fell in love with the soup. Staff was pleasant both visits and the restaurant was clean and comforting."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its name- yummy food and great service. Lunch specials are a good deal. They serve duck meat which is good news for my husband and I. There are also different Southeast Asian dishes on their menu such as pho. They also have the conventional fried rice and egg rolls. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing food  we enjoyed the red curry, hot & sour soup. Sticky rice mango, yummy.   will be back many times."}
{"text":"Great Thai food.  My wife and I will be back for sure.  She said she loved the curry and egg rolls."}
{"text":"The only complaint we had is that there was one waitress handling the entire restaurant! I hope their now hiring sign attracts more waitresses! So it was understandably slow and took forev to get the check. BUT the food was amazing! Chicken pad thai was delish and their tom kah soup was out of this world! When you order 'medium' spice level expect that to mean HOT! I would recommend ordering it mild and then asking for the sides of hot sauces. I wish they had some more appetizers that were a little less expensive but otherwise it was amazing!"}
{"text":"I haven't tasted the food yet, but that's because I have been waiting for the delivery for over an hour and a half. . . When I called they said their driver is busy and it should arrive soon, but they didn't ask who I was or have any idea if my order actually went through. . . Hopefully it arrives soon, is at least decently warn, and the ice in the iced tea isn't completely melted yet. . . Will update when the food arrives to say how it tastes, but won't be changing the rating from 1 star.  -- Update: After 2 hours of waiting I cancelled my order. Not sure if it is Tom Yum that is the problem or EatStreet that does the delivery that has the problem, but I'm leaving the 1 star review as they need to work it out. Unfortunate because I see good reviews for the food and was looking forward to trying it."}
{"text":"Disappointed ....Took my dad out to chow & he left his meal, that has happened only  once before eating Thai. The decor & interior is lovely..First off their dinner portions are small compared to what I've had other Thai spots in town..The papaya salad was fine, their hot is not very spicy.The Masamang curry w Chicken was the stopper, the curry was OK, but the chicken was under-cooked to the point my father bolted out.  Surprisingly, their didn't seem to be  much concern about this when it was addressed to the server, not sure if its common, but the cavalier attitude toward this could have been better handled.  Lunch size meal for dinner price w under-cooked chicken is not the dining experience I was looking to treat him to."}
{"text":"We moved here from Portland Oregon and have been searching for a good Thai restaurant  for quite some time.  Tom Yum is as close to our favorite place in Portland that we can find.  Good service, friendly servers, clean facility and the food is very good."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I can only speak about the pad Thai since that's the only thing I ever order. One annoyance is that they will not deliver to my house anymore when I call, but I found a work around. If I order via the yelp app, they have no choice but to deliver since my address falls within a certain range. There have been a couple of times when the chicken was dry, it can be a hit and miss, but mostly a hit."}
{"text":"Ok I now come here on a weekly basis (sometimes several times a week). I have upped my rating because I love it even more! Food is still great - Thai tea AMAZING!!! And the service and staff is great and super friendly!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Really surprised with the food & service at Tom Yum. It was our 1st time and never thought about twice about going in and glad we finally decided to check it out. The restaurant is small and in a strip mall hidden in a corner. The service & kids were very nice and always smiling. The soup pot with Tom Kha was super followed by the crispy noodles and seafood. Really good and will be back."}
{"text":"Okay so I love Thai food and this food was really good. However, I am giving a 2 star review, not because the food was bad but there were rocks in my curry :( I hope my tooth isn't cracked. Actual rocks!! Really!!??!!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived during a very busy lunch service. Both the service and the food were hit-or-miss.   We ordered tea and got water. The appetizers were supposed to be spring rolls (not fried), but what we got were small egg rolls (fried).   On the upside, the entrées were delicious. My wife had the drunken noodles and I had the red curry with squid.   We also ordered the sweet rice with mango for dessert. This is one of our favorite Thai desserts. Unfortunately, the rice was overcooked to the point it was all stuck together and was uncuttable with a fork. The sauce was runny.   Perhaps service and food is better when they are not as busy. Hard to say."}
{"text":"While the textures and qualities of the ingredients are acceptable, I am really unhappy with the spice and flavor profiles across the dishes I've tried. As a Thai food fanatic, I hoped the food at this restaurant would gratify my frequent cravings for noodles and curry in this town with very limited Asian food options. Even at the five star spice level, the flavors are bland, boring, and ultimately so dissatisfying that I have resorted to cooking my own Thai food instead of patronizing this establishment."}
{"text":"Well this is another flop of a restaurant in the West Valley!  No one can get Asian food right in this town except for P. F. Chang's!!  First off the restaurant had weird fluorescent lighting, so no ambiance whatsoever.  The food was edible, but \"blah and forgettable\".  Sort of bland and they use frozen veggies and cheap ingredients.  Haven't been back since trying this place once."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Came in with my twin 1 year old girls and it took 5 minutes to get high chairs 10 minutes later not even a drink order. 2 couples walked in after us and they had drinks and order in and we stall had not even been talked to. After about 15 to 20 minutes we left. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Never order anything over the phone or online. Twice they have screwed up the order by either mixing it up or not having it ready when they said they would. I don't like the food enough to put up with these kinds of mistakes."}
{"text":"I love this place the staff is great and I am OBSESSED with the Pineapple Duck Curry!!!! You have to try this. So much that I had enough for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"if I could give negative stars I would. my family drove in from our hometown of Vegas to see my husband's parents and we decided to grab dinner. I come from a Thai/Lao family and my husband is Filipino we both are really culturally diverse when it comes to food.  We were not greeted at the door. the one waitress working in a busy dinner service simply pointed to a booth I understand that this is a retirement community so I didn't expect authentic Thai food.. we didn't get any service but a table that came after us had already ordered. looked at the menu and they don't even use actual Chinese broccoli. if you promote authentic food please use authentic ingredients...  I understand you have to cater to the elderly but regardless of your changes to the menu customer service comes first. we come from a service industry city with high expectations on food and quality.   waited 15 minutes no water no assistance so we left if you're looking for authentic Thai food with good customer service this place doesn't have neither"}
{"text":"Me and my friend ordered orange chicken and drunken noodles which were alright. The orange chicken was mostly soggy but the drunken noodles had crunchy vegetables and flavor. The real problem starts when we get home. My friend threw up all the food from the restaurant and I had painful stomach problems and had to go to the bathroom. Based on my knowledge, this could be the result of a food borne illness from not practicing proper kitchen safety!!! We won't be coming back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Stopped here to try lunch and....  What a great addition to Surprise.  I enjoyed the pork pad Thai.  I went with no heat, but will be more adventurous and get mild heat next time.  Flavorful dish with peanuts and fresh bean sprouts to mix in the noodles.  The lunch also came with a ginger, seasoned soup and a nice sized egg roll.    I dropped $8 and my lunch guest spent $10 on the shrimp pad Thai.  Nice sized shrimp came with the dish.    I plan on trying the soup next, based on Bo R's recommendations.  Also since lunch was great.  Nice mix of flavors and a different lunch treat out in Surprise.  Finally not another burger or pizza place.    Try this place out, you will not be disappointed.  Plus its open till 10 PM."}
{"text":"I order from here frequently. The food is superb, and the kids love it. My favorites are yellow curry with chicken, extra veggies, and no potatoes.  Very accommodating of special requests.  Caution: when ordering through the Yelp app, if you have ANY special instructions,  call them in. They messed up a delivery order twice, despite special allergy instructions being printed prominently in bold on the order ticket.  Supposed to be getting a refund, but it's been a few days now with no follow-up so I'm not hopeful."}
{"text":"Location & Aesthetics - Located in Surprise in the same area as Home Depot (just opposite) just off Bell Road.  The restaurant's signage can be a little difficult to miss as the strip mall is large with many stores so it can be overlooked.  Once you're facing Office Max, just walk to the right pass Panda Express and a couple other stores and you shouldn't miss it then.   Plenty of parking is available but remember parking spots are shared with other surrounding businesses so the parking area can get a little busy but don't fret, if you can't find a parking spot in front of the business, you can easily park in the surrounding vicinity and walk, and the walk isn't far at all...just a couple feet.   The restaurant is clean, spacious and well lit however my only gripe with the atmosphere was there was no separate place to order to go.  If one wanted to place an order to go, either you would call ahead or, if you're on the premises, you have to walk through the restaurant, pass the dinning tables where other patrons are dining  Menu - The menu is available at the counter where you place your order to go.  You can even chose to sit at the counter which resembles a bar counter and wait for the order or eat it there.  There's a lunch menu which is a bit cheaper ($8).  I also believe you can place your order online as well.    Service - The staff was nice, friendly, warm and welcoming.  The lady who took our orders answered any questions we had.    Food - I order the sweet and sour chicken which, to my puzzlement, came separated in two containers unlike the rest of the orders that was placed.  I guess this was to ensure the rice didn't become saturated with the sweet and sour sauce.   The rice was soft and hot (the way I prefer), the chicken was well cooked and seasoned with the correct proportion of chicken to vegetables in the sweet and sour sauce.  The latter - the sweet and sour sauce was perfectly made with the correct ratio of sweet versus sour, neither being too overpowering to the other.  I will definitely be back to try some of their other offerings on the menu!"}
{"text":"Me and my son love this place period!! Wish it was bigger but the food is FANTASTIC!! Best Thai Food in the valley! If ur in Surprise u gotta try it!"}
{"text":"With a name like Tom Yum you would expect the soup to be excellent. My wife hates onions, cilantro and tofu, 3 of the main ingredients if you order it vegetarian. However we LOVE the soup and my wife insists on getting the soup every time we've visited.  The restaurant is very vegetarian friendly as they have more than just tofu, they have several other \"fake meats\" that you can include in the dishes. I've tried a different dish every time we've gone and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was ok when it usually is great.... Rice was overdone or looked like it was old with no seasoning on it (i ordered Hawaiian fried rice) On a Friday night make sure you order at least an hour and a half early. They only have 3 people working the floors and no one is answering the phones or the online ordering. They finally answered the phone after I called 45 times(I was craving pad Thai).... Their fax machine has a message saying \"we are trying to get a hold of you\".... I would not go on a busy night like this again.... If you want good Thai food here go Monday-Thursday....."}
{"text":"Service is great. Food is on point. Portions are definitely adequate. I like that they have different levels of spicy that you can order for your dish. I always make sure to eat here at least once when I'm in surprise."}
{"text":"I consider myself to be a Thai food connoisseur.  Also, being Asian and a cook, I tend to be very picky when it comes to good food.    Grandma and I stopped in to grab lunch after running errands and decided to give this place a try.  Ambiance and service was great!  The food was very tasty and flavorful but they are very chintzy on the meat portion.  We both ordered the Chicken Spicy Noodle (Pad Khee Mao) and there were probably 4 two inch, thin pieces of chicken each. I ordered the Chicken Panang for my husband who is very big eater.  I asked the server how the lunch portion is compared to the dinner's.  He pointed to a table nearby and the lunch portion was about a 1 1/2 cup portion in a small soup bowl.  So I ordered the dinner portion.  We were so disappointed because we paid extra for the dinner portion thinking we would get more chicken in the dinner portion but it was the exact same amount of the lunch portion.  There were about 4 thin slices of chicken and about 1 cup worth of sliced bell peppers!!  What a rip off!  This is the reason for not giving 5 stars.  We may consider going back but will most likely look for another place before we do.  Hopefully, we can find a good Thai place that has generous portions of meat.  For the price, we expect to get meat and not tons of veggies."}
{"text":"I ordered beef pho and Shrimp Summer Rolls. I ordered delivery.  The food arrived at the temperatures they should be at. The summer rolls were pretty disappointing. It came with two rolls cut in half. Out of the 4 halfs I had two small shrimps, maybe an inch and a half in size. It would have been better with more shrimp, even if it was just one more tiny shrimp because with what I got it was pretty much a veggie roll. The pho was good but the veggies they served with it looked old and withered so I skipped on adding them in. The Pho probably would have been better with fresh veggies."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!  It doesn't get any spicier then this amazing food. Possibly the best I have ever had. Nestled in a shopping center. Our server was kind and helpful with my choice. The seafood is fresh and the broccoli crunchy. They start everyone out with spring rolls and soup. Try it!!! Blazing hot if you want it. Also the temperature was just perfect too."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great atmosphere.  We made a very  satisfying meal by simply sharing two appetizers, and the deserts were quite good also.  This has become \"our \" place in Surprise, AZ."}
{"text":"Food is always good, come here every Monday, great staff too! Megan and Lowen are always awesome servers and we only visit when they are working!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place! Only suggestion would be get an ro system to improve the taste of drinking water."}
{"text":"Excellent service and even better food! There has not been one time I have been dissatisfied. We will keep coming here for the best Thai food in Surprise!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the Sushi place next door until i noticed this place. Tom Yum has absolutely the best Thai food i have had. The portions are large and usually I have to take home left-overs. The pricing is below average. As far as value goes, it is a definite must for anyone who loves asian food.   I will double up on the Yums - Tom Yum Yum !!!"}
{"text":"Their phó was so good. I've tried a few places and maybe I was really hungry, but....yum!!! My friend had the Larb salad and that was good too! It was my first time trying it, but that phó. I had mixed meat, but next time I'll do chicken or beef. I spiced it to my liking although the waitress did ask."}
{"text":"I'm honestly not sure why I don't eat here more. The food is fantastic, and I've enjoyed everything I've ever ordered.  It could be that it's just tucked in the corner of a strip mall and I just don't see it enough when I drive down the street.  But as far as Thai food goes, this place is worth a stop. Their heat-meter seems to be set a tad higher than most other places in the valley, so just be aware of that if it's a concern. They're constantly refilling your water glass anyway.    The place is open, clean, comfortable, aesthetically attractive, and the service is good as well."}
{"text":"Seafood salad (2 mussels, shrimp, squid, white fish) not bad. $16 TAXES and tip 21.5. Clean restaurant . About 6 pm. Staff took care of me."}
{"text":"I had the pad thai and it was pretty good, also the thai tea was good as well. It was a little pricier than I expected and the waitress took a while to bring me my check and water refills, overall, it was all pretty good"}
{"text":"Service is excellent.  The soup was different from what I was used to, but was told it's closer to the  authentic version.  Ask for their spicy fish sauce if it's tip mild for you.  Overall a very positive experience.  Food is good for the money, but not quite good enough for five stars."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout tonight and holy mother of god. Fucking delicious. I ordered chicken pad Thai and my lover ordered the orange chicken with white rice. Holy shit. The pad Thai was a flavor train in my mouth. I ordered mild spice and it was perfect in every sense of the word. I want to order again tomorrow. And the next day. And the next."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.   Service was pretty good too. Friendly and fast.  It was nice that they had draft beer."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly. The restaurant is clean and very well decorated; peaceful. I ordered the shrimp Pad Thai and it was delicious; equally sweet, spicy, sour, and savory. My food came out quickly. The prices were a little high."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! An unassuming hidden gem! The stewed curry beef and Pad Thai are my faves along with panang,  coconut mushroom soup and Thai tea. Service is always friendly and on point also they deliver."}
{"text":"A great thai place. Tried many dishes on the menu and everything has been good. Last time there tried drunken chicken and it was delicous."}
{"text":"I went there tonight for dinner.  The place smelled wonderful but I was hungry.  I sat at the bar area.  There were 3 tables & someone else at the bar area.  I sat there for a little over 5 minutes without even being approached by waitstaff with a menu & a \"I'll be right with you.\"  One waitress did come out of the kitchen twice to answer the phone then went right back in without addressing me.  The other waitress was taking an order.  The man at the bar got up walked around the counter and washed his hands at the bar then came around & sat back down.  At this point I left.  Someone there needs to get their act together.  You HAVE to be diligent and attentive with your customers."}
{"text":"The food is good. Usually the service is fine, however now they have 3 employees that all have no idea what they are doing, all 3 of them in the front ask the customers the same questions instead of just one person being a greeter, obviously all are new and don't mesh well together. One girl has a very bad attitude and one customer was trying to tell her what he ordered for pick up and she wouldn't even look in his direction, she just seemed like she hated working here. She kept muttering under her breath the whole time that they are running out of supplies and seemed very frustrated. They all were discussing how to open up a bottle of wine, and how they were going to figure it out. Inexperience + bad attitude is not a good combination, there needs to be a manager that needs to step in quick to supervise these employees and get them trained and informed on how to perform their tasks so customers aren't put off by this. An older gentleman was kind of lingering around behind the counter and was not in uniform and was wearing a nascar hat that had nothing to do with the restaurant which is strange cause it just seems like a random guy is hanging out behind the counter...is he the manager? Is he a friend of the owner? Or the owner himself? Your guess is as good as mine. He was sipping on soda from the restaurant and walking back and forth with a few buttons un-buttoned from his shirt like he was walking around in his home....WEIRD! Good food is only half the experience when going somewhere, make sure you don't let this place go downhill! Cause the food is really good! Get your staff trained and up to speed! I ordered a to go order (4 dishes) and it took over a half hour."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting We sat down and prepare to eat but we had to get back up and walk out  Not going back And What is the meaning of TOM YUM? Is it suppose to mean something?"}
{"text":"Overall good Thai food.  Some times are better than others so it might just depend on the chef for the day.."}
{"text":"Food is here is pretty solid (about 4-star worthy). I came in on a Saturday afternoon and ordered the chicken pad see ew, chili string beans with pork, and a Thai iced tea.. Noodles in the pad see ew were cooked well and the ratio of meat to vegetables was fine. No complaints with the chili string bean either, except that it was a little bit oversauced. However, there was plenty of rice to soak up the sauce, which was a pleasant surprise considering most Thai places give way too little rice to make up for the amount of sauce in their dishes. Food portions were quite big and we had to doggy bag our meal at the end. Thai iced tea was very good, although there was too much ice (filled from top to bottom).  I do have to knock off one star for the service, however. Other than when she took our drink and food order, she never came by and asked how we were doing. She did spend some spend schmoozing with some other customers while we were ignored. Furthermore, we were ready to order food by the time she asked for drinks but for some reason, she had someone else come by to take our food order (which resulted in us waiting an additional 5 minutes or so)."}
{"text":"Average tasting Thai food. Drunken Noodle, Fried Rice Chicken, Pad Thai. The Tom Kaw Soup was a little better than average.  We liked Line Thai better for all of the other dishes much more flavor, but it's a little further out, so we gave Tom Yum another shot. We will be driving the extra distance to pick up @ L.T. from now on...."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I don't get why they have low reviews. I've been here twice and I'm definitely in love!!"}
{"text":"Visiting my brother and he highly suggested this place.  I'm so glad he did as the food was so fresh and delicious! I had the pad Thai and my brother had the spicey green bean with chicken.  Everything was outstanding and we will be back for sure! For desert we had sticky rice with coconut ice cream.  Bottom line is I highly recommend this nice little gem of a place.  I also had to mention that the staff was all very kind and considerate."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant totally by accident and so happy we did. I understand they have only been open for about 6 months, and yet, on a very rainy day, they still had a steady flow of lunchtime traffic.   We ordered from the lunch menu - Shrimp Pad Thai, and Chicken Green Curry. We were encouraged and anticipating great flavors after sampling the complimentary soup and spring rolls. We were not disappointed. Pad Thai was delicious and one of the best I've had. It is my comparison dish, and truth be told, I can't go to a Thai restaurant without ordering their Pad Thai. The shrimp were big and juicy and the dish had just the right amount of seasoning. The green curry chicken was served in a bowl with rice on the side. So many subtle flavors in every bite - curry, of course, but the vegetables had this smoky quality - all too delicious. My partner couldn't quit raving about this dish!  We will definitely stop back here the next time we pass through. What impressed us most, besides the very attentive service and cleanliness, was the freshness of the food. Really can't wait to go back.   To the person who said they ordered spring rolls and that they were unhappy because they were fried - that's what spring rolls are: FRIED! On this menu, they are called Veggie Rolls, and clearly say they are fried. They resemble what most people know as Spring Rolls. Egg Rolls were not on the menu, and I don't believe they are Thai, but would have been larger, in any event. You probably meant to order the Summer Rolls, that are wrapped in a soft rice skin, and served with peanut sauce. Summer Rolls are not fried.  Also, we thought the menu was just the right size with just enough variety."}
{"text":"Outstanding food with authentic quality. The yellow curry and pad thai was great. I really liked the Thai desert options. The service was prompt and friendly. Overall, a great little restaurant."}
{"text":"First of all, I was disappointed because they offered nothing for kids. I ended up walking over to Taco Bell for my grandson. So, it's not the best place for younger children. I will say the food was great and the service, well they guy was super nice but the service was terrible. I'd eat here again, just without the little kiddos."}
{"text":"It's ok because it's Thai food! However, they do NOT know how to make their food spicy of flavorful. If you like mild and bland, this is your thai joint."}
{"text":"I LOVE THAI FOOD.   This place does not disappoint.  Had a party of 3 and the server cleaned a booth for us during a busy time for them.  Place was packed on a Saturday night with people even on the patio.   Ordered appetizers, soup,  entrees, and drinks. Small wait but was worth it for freshly made food. Everything we ordered with the exception of the Green Mango Salad was really good. The salad wasn't horrible. .. just different.  Not marking them down for the salad.  Love that Thai food is quality cuts of meat and not fat & fried like Chinese food always is.  Definitely a great place to go and enjoy really great Thai food."}
{"text":"Great Thai food close to surprise is hard to come by. I got pretty spoiled from living in Washington and having amazing authentic Thai food. So I decided to try out Tum yum cause it was close to home and it was amazing!! Not only was the server great the food was just as great :) I've probably gone back about 4 times now when I get a real craving for spicy food and each time has never been a disappointment :) oh and their Thai tea is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best places for a healthy meal, servers are nice, food is always well done and hot, pricing is not to bad, I recommend this place to anyone that will listen :) sticky rice with coconut cream ice is the BEST"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their pad Thai, yellow curry and drunken noodles. We have never had a bad experience. They are always very nice and food is fast."}
