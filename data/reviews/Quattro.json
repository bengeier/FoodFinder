{"text":"I have celiac and the service for gluten free customers (and full gluten customers) is fantastic. The owner assured me I would be pleased when I asked over the phone and he delivered. The food was so fresh. They baked a fresh GF roll,served hot. Olive oil was very high quality. All the appetizers had a gf option. Had the bufalo Mozzarella and grilled calamari... both awesome. They imported gf pasta from Italy, it was delicious. They made a primavera off the menu with all the in season vegetables... so good... and finished off with a gf chocolate soufflé (like air it was so light) and their fresh made vanilla ice cream. I am  very sensitive  to any gluten and feel fine after this feast. It was a higher end restaurant, but the quality of the food and the service made it well worth it."}
{"text":"Beautiful Italian restaurant in the middle of old Montreal. The space is all exposed brick, crown mouldings and soft lighting. A great spot to sit down, relax and enjoy a pretty amazing Italian meal.  To start, the service was excellent. There were no less than three people attending to each table, ensuring that fluids were topped, olive oil and other accoutrements present, and that your food was to your liking.  I had the truffled pasta with a cream sauce and it was exactly what I needed. Beautiful glass of Pinot (yes, I know, but I really wanted a Pinot noir and the wine cut through the cream and balanced the truffle!).   Fresh bread is brought to your table to start and there is a plate and olive oil readily available for bread dipping. Will definitely go back, the next I am in town.  Of note, a couple walked in with several children, the youngest still in a stroller. The staff were great about helping the couple find a place to install the stroller and find them a place toward the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Vendredi 26 septembre 2014  Par un superbe vendredi ensoleillé, les pas décidés, on se dirige vers le Centre de Commerce Mondial. On décide d'essayer un endroit fraîchement ouvert, Quattro Piatti, petite place de sandwich, en apparence très design, avec une allure invitante.  Le concept est simple, on choisit le type de sandwich puis le plat principal qui y sera ajouté puis les accompagnements (légumes, sauce, etc...) qui garniront le sandwich ou le plat.  Toutefois, un gros bémol, on vous suggère, par exemple, un sandwich La Piadina, malheureusement ce n'en est pas du tout ! On considère le client pour un niais. C'est un vulgaire wrap ! La Piadina est un sandwich fait comme une crêpe pliée en deux et grillée (obligatoire) originaire d'une région d'Italie, l'Émilie-Romagne. Il en a été question à l'émission l'Épicerie, à Radio-Canada. Ce N'EST PAS un wrap ! On exploite ici l'idée crée par un restaurant américain présenté à Diners-Drive-ins-and-Dives sur le Food Network. En bout de ligne, l'amalgame de saveurs est bien ordinaire et ça ressemble à n'importe quelle sandwicherie ou kiosque de bouffe sur le pouce, tout simplement.  Friday septembre 26th 2014  On a sunny and warm-hot friday, feet on-the-go, I walk out toward the Centre de Commerce Mondial. Decided to try a fresh new place Quattro Piatti, small sandwich stand in an alluring design.  Simple concept, you pick your format of meal, then your inside and then the garnish (vegetables and sauces).  Althought seems to be very stylish, ... if you pick the Piadina, .... it's NOT ! The Piadina IS NOT a wrap ! The Piadina is a crepe served grilled and folded in half. Its origins are in Italy, from the Emilie-Romagne region. That particular folded crepe-sandwich was also featured on the popular public affairs show l'Épicerie on Radio-Canada network. They are simply exploiting an idea originally created in an american restaurant featured on the popular show Diners-Drive-ins-and-Dives on the Food Network. They take the client for a ride. End of the line is....the flavor mixt is not original, it's not a new concept, it looks like a very ordinary sandwich and fast meal place on-the-go."}
