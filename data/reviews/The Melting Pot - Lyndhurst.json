{"text":"Rudest staff ever! Friend was double charged, called the next day and they said they didn't have time to talk to her! They said they was call back but never did! Our server, Michael, is a complete jerk."}
{"text":"For a meal you cook yourself there is no excuse for how slow the service was.  It took us 3 hours to finish the meal with us waiting around an empty pot for 20 to 30 minutes between each course.  I would not recommended this restaurant."}
{"text":"Where's the zero-star option? It wasn't my choice to try this place, and I will certainly NEVER go back. The bill for our disgusting meal came out to ~ $100/pp, and it wasn't like we chose the most expensive options. So what did we get for our money? Dry, pre-cut veggies (obviously out of a bag) and skimpy portions of very average meats and seafood, with bland cheese, oil, or salty broth. Nothing like biting into a half-raw potato that's been soaking in College Inn! Ugh. I didn't bother trying the dessert, because dipping cubes of what looks like Entenmann's pound cake into Hershey's syrup isn't my thing. And terrible food aside, I've never before been subjected to such blatant upselling by restaurant staff. A manager came over to pester us at one point because she thought we weren't ordering enough (\"I'm concerned that you don't have enough food\"), which is just tacky. That's a good word for the whole operation, actually."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and the atmosphere was unique and intimate.

The two tables that we were between had a great server. He went though how the menu works after learning that they had never been to the Melting Pot before. He brought complimentary desert to one couple that was celebrating their anniversary. He checked in on them regularly and made sure they were taken care of the best he possibly could. If he would have heard me call for him I was going to tip him and list his name for a great review even though he wasn't our server.

Our server was a different story. Although I know his name, I won't list it as this should be a general message for any server. Don't blow off your customers just because they have a Groupon. I understand you don't generally make as much off of tips from your Groupon crowd, but let's talk about the long term effects here. Groupon customers are using their Groupon for one (or maybe two) of two reasons. One, they can't afford the regular price menu items. Two, Groupon did its job and caught someone's attention to give your restaurant a try regardless of their financial status. I enjoy saving money like anyone else on planet earth (including my nameless server, I'm sure) and I understand that the chunk of server's money comes from their tips. Knowing that, I tip based off of the total bill that I have accumulated including whatever the Groupon helped out with. Maybe if our server would have thought this way we wouldn't have been guessing our way through the menu and trying to figure out how we should order things. Maybe it wouldn't have felt like we were pulling teeth when asking for help with the menu or when we had to ask for refills. Maybe there would have been more enthusiasm than Ben Stein would have had when lighting our Flaming Turtle desert ablaze. Maybe I would have left a more substantial tip (hint hint, I would have).

Overall I would probably go back but I would surely hope to get the server that I observed at the two tables we were between. If it weren't for him I wouldn't consider it. Then again, maybe his customers didn't use Groupon."}

{"text":"Went here for a birthday gathering. Very intimate setting for our party of 8 which was nice. Menu pricey but paying for the experience. Service was attentive. Best part was the cheese fondue and the amazing dessert. It was fun, would go back for an occasion."}
{"text":"Went to \"spa night\" at the Melting Pot this evening. This special night is held the last Monday of every month excluding December. It is a fixed price of $30.00 including tip and tax. Good deal.

You start off by choosing wine, martinis or a bellini. Then you get a choice of salad. Followed by cheese fondue and finished with chocolate fondue. Somewhere in the middle of dinner you get a mini spa service. Our choices tonight were a quick chair massage, paraffin wax treatment or makeup application. It is a good excuse for a ladies night out!"}
{"text":"Food is way overpriced and bland.  Silly sauce combinations which bear no relationship to your entree and the chosen method of cooking.  Slow service.   Restaurant seemed to be understaffed, although there were several workers sitting at the bar throughout the evening.  I can't imagine ever returning."}
{"text":"My husband and our two children (ages 6 and 9) had a lovely evening at the Melting Pot. Three of us are on a gluten-free diet, and The Melting Pot accommodated us in an amazing way. They provided GF bread, brownies and pound cake, and this was way beyond our expectations. We will definitely dine here again soon!"}
{"text":"We had never been to a Melting Pot but saw a Groupon for 2 so bought it & made a reservation for a Sunday night.  At the time of making the reservation we mentioned we had a Groupon as that was required in the terms of the Groupon. 

We arrived at 5:53 & checked in with the hostess. She said she'd seat us soon. A little after 6 we were seated at a booth for 2.  Our waitress stopped by, asked if we'd ever been before, and took our wine order.  Almost half an hour later the manager came by to drop off our wine- one glass was right, one was wrong, but she took both back with her when we told her since she said she might have grabbed the wrong ticket.  We waited... And waited... Finally (and I really never do this) I asked our neighbors' server to grab us some water since it'd been over half an hour at that point since we'd sat down and we still didn't have anything to drink. 

Our server came over in the next few minutes with water and the correct wine, so I told her I'd asked another server for water and to please let him know we didn't need it anymore. 

Our server then took our food order.  Our Groupon didn't include a cheese fondue but we ordered one. We also ordered what was included in our Groupon (2 salads, choice of cooking style, & each person chose 3 types of meat/seafood/etc).

Our server (after a lonnnng time) brought out what we later realized was the wrong cheese fondue. She also forgot our request to have extra veggies instead of bread.  When we realized it was the wrong cheese, we tried to tell someone- anyone... But no one came until we flagged down the hostess. 

We told her the cheese was wrong- she said she'd find our server... And we waited... And waited... The manager finally came by.  At this point my fiancé- someone I've never witnessed complain at a restaurant before- was so frustrated by the non existence of staff when we needed them that he spoke up (politely).  We explained the series of mishaps and absent service. She said she'd take care of our first 2 glasses of wine and told us our new pot of cheese was warming up in the back. 

Then we waited... And waited.  We thought for sure that would've come to an end by this point. The new cheese came out with veggies and it was great (Alpine option).

We each had another glass of wine and the rest of our meal went well.  The manager stepped in to deliver most of our food & drinks.  She did apologize for the mess ups.  I did ask her if the sloppiness was bc we had a Groupon- she said no not at all & most customers there that night were there with Groupons.  

When we were done with our entree my fiancé had another glass of wine he was finishing and the manager came by and suggested chocolate would go well with it. We said we were pretty stuffed & she said \"well, if I were to drop some chocolate off accidentally you wouldn't be upset would you?\"  She did drop off some dark chocolate and strawberries/shortcake/brownies/etc.
 
When we got our bill it was $48. Granted, we'd had a Groupon, but here's all the extra stuff we ordered, not to mention the free choc fondue the manager dropped off:

-5 glasses of wine (8 oz pours)
-cheese fondue
-2 add ons of Italian meats for the cheese fondue

We also effectively got 1.5 cheese fondues since my fiancé kept eating the first one after we told them that it was the wrong one (hey, we were hungry & the manager said to feel free to eat it). 

So I'll say that although at one point I considered prematurely asking for the bill & leaving before we were done, the manager totally turned the experience around.  A really nice effort on her part to salvage the evening for us."}
{"text":"Unhealthy, Smell gets in your hair, MUCH bigger chance of eating raw food.

I ordered the 'Surf & Turf' combo. I got raw chicken, raw steak, and raw shrimp on a plate. 
YOU have to cook the food yourself, based on their casual \"Two-Minute Rule\".

If you don't have a timer on your cell-phone (even though I do), this isn't only a bad experience, but also a dangerous one.

This was especially bad for a group because, just imagine; 

Eight people sticking raw food into one small pot, trying to keep track of how long it's been in there, and if it's theirs or not. Lots of raw food sinking to the bottom of the pot, lots of people accidentally eating a piece of half-raw food, and lots of people over or under-cooking their meal."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever been to The Melting Pot.  My wife and daughter were here a few weeks ago and they loved it so they wanted to bring me.  

The food was excellent and so was the service.  It is not your typical restaurant.  Yes, you do have to cook your food in a pot.  I see reviews complaining about the prices because you have to cook your own food but this is not your typical restaurant.

I don't mind paying the price as long as the FOOD and SERVICE are excellent.  We definitely got excellent food and service.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Used a groupon to eat here yesterday.  We boiled meat in broth, which of course made everything taste like it was seasoned with water.  They bring several dipping sauces to the table with your entree, only one of them was edible, and only barely so.  Portions were small and vegetables = about three small pieces each.  We were there about 1.5 hours to get through the meal as well.  So overall it is very expensive, probably the most bland food we've ever had, we cooked our food, and it took forever.  

The only positive thing to say is that out waiter was excellent"}
{"text":"I have been to other fondue places before so I knew what to expect when we hit the door of this higher class restaraunt in a very high class neighborhood.  I came in with a Groupon and didn't know menu prices.  

As I found out later, saying the Groupon covered a meal for two was like saying you can wear a swimsuit to church.  We had a reservation but still had to wait almost 20 minutes to be seated and this was on a weekday at 4:30 PM.  

We chose our meals and the food was very good.  We also had a nice interaction with our server Meg M. She told us she was going on vacation the next week to the Bahamas.  We wished her well and finished and paid for our meal.

TWO COMPLAINTS.  1. The Groupon no where near covered the cost of the meal minus drinks, not even close.  The bill was more than double what the Groupon covered   2. More importantly, the next monday I get a notice from my bank asking me about a $1300 charge on Caribbean Airlines.  Imagine my suprise and anger.

I called the restaraunt and talked to the manager about what happened and she basicly told me her staff is honest and I have to be mistaken.  I was treated like I was the one that took something from them.  The manager wouldn't ever concider the possibility that her staff could have done this.

Note:  when you pay there like most higher class places, your card leaves your sight.  It's easy for a server to copy the info as well as the 3 digit number on the back.

I WILL NEVER GO BACK AND I ENCOURAGE OTHERES NOT TO."}
{"text":"The dinner my wife and I had was fantastic. The wait staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. We were even treated to a free tasting plate of sesame crusted ahi tuna, duck and salmon from our waiter! The duck was absolutely delicious. This was a great date night for us."}
{"text":"Worst place and service to go. Server and manager extremely rude. Unpleasant place to be at"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm going to get beat up for giving a better than 2-star review for Melting Pot, but feel compelled to point out some of the positives of dining here. Plus, I actually get a kick out of fondue - I know, cheesy (no pun intended) - I love fondue. So much that I've actually gone to Potpourri in Mentor. Now, eat there, then eat at Melting Pot. Might bump your stars up a few!

I frequent The Melting Pot - partly because it's 5 minutes from my house and it's a fun place to eat with friends. Plenty of time to share stories, kick back some wine and just chill. Sure, at the end of the night you're not going to be commenting on some spectacular meal, but can't complain about the service and they have one of the most extensive wine lists in Cleveland. The way I see it - you're eating here to have a relaxing meal out of the house, in the company of good friends and for the fondue experience. If you don't do fondue, don't eat here.

We always get The Big Night Out. The key to not being so uncomfortably full by the end of the meal that you actually consider asking the staff to just roll you out is to hold back on the salad course. It's salad. Well, if you get the Caesar, eat all the Parmesan-crusted pine nuts - those are yummy! And, don't pass on the dipping sauces. The Green Goddess is great on the potatoes and the mild curry is fantastic on the chicken. And, during a visit last week we made a drinking game out of losing veggies/meat in the broth - if you had to use the rescue spoon, you had to drink. Simple concept.

Finally, Oreo-crusted marshmallows and graham cracker-crusted marshmallows are awesome! Been there enough times to have tried the Original, Yin & Yang, Turtle, S'mores and Baileys and I think my favorite is the Yin & Yang. Presentation is fun and the flavor of both the white and dark chocolates work well with the various dippers. Maybe I'm not difficult to please ... like fresh fruit, fudge-like brownies and those marshmallows. Did I mention them?"}
{"text":"Went for a spa night last night (Mon April 28). Nikki was our server. She was exceptional. She paced the meal perfectly because we also added an entree to the preset spa night menu. She was funny and attentive. The food was amazing as always."}
{"text":"The food and service were phenomenal. We had the spinach artichoke cheese fondue which was amazing. The mojo pot was fantastic. And the chocolate fondue was so incredible. The dessert enhancement was way worth it. We had a great time. Unfortunately though this place is only affordable with a groupon."}
{"text":"Unbelievable rip- off.  Fondue using terrible quality wonder-like bread.  The entrees give you a few pieces of raw meat to boil in the poor quality broth.  Seriously, just about any adult will find the portion size to be laughable and it is expensive to boot.  service was ok and the choclate fondue for dessert is good.  I've gone a couple times because kids find it fun, but the restauant should be ashamed for the incredibly lame portions and quality of everything  except the desert  ( but which is also terribly over priced)"}
{"text":"My son wrote the original post by Alex R...we do not wish for any hand outs and would not come back to your establish. It would be great if the staff/manager/hostess took 2 seconds to look at my email confirmation to see that I was on time (6pm) instead of telling me several times \"no I cancelled it .. It was at 5:15 but we will seat you anyway\". Embarrassing In Front of a lobby full of people. By the time  we were seated around 6:30 we had been rushed through a 4 coarse meal with a party of 6... We were out by 8. Your promotional videos state.... Take your time enjoy your experience instead we were informed they were \"slammed\" and we felt burdensome like we did something wrong. The food was excellent and waiter was good but I frequent a lot of nice restaurants where we are treated like a paying customer should. The waiter even missed out on a bigger tip too just based on overall experience...."}
{"text":"This was my family's first time dining here. We were seated promptly, and they even had the high chair for my toddler ready at the table. The menu was pretty straight forward and our server did a good job of explaining things and answering our questions. She was very attentive at first. But then that quickly changed once we started eating. After she brought out the soup and meats, she only came by one more time. I asked for more sauce and she never came back. We never got refills on water. We received hardly any veggies for the soup, especially for 4 people. The steak pieces I received looked like the scraps of a steak, while my husband had nice large cuts. We sat done eating for almost 30 minutes, when she finally came back. She did apologize for the delay, but 30 minutes?  Seriously? She knew we had a toddler with us too. The food was just ok. The basic soup broth is nothing special. The cheese at the beginning was just ok too. We had gift cards to use, but we will most likely not return after this. The food and experience was not worth the $200 for four adults. We left very disappointed in our meal. We were there for my husband's birthday, which our server also knew, she they didn't do anything special. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Service is always excellent, though they seem disorganized at times.  Food is good, but not really worth the high price.  Nice place for a date night."}
{"text":"Today was our first experience at the Melting Pot and we enjoyed ourselves. The host and server were great and were exceptionally kind to our 3 yr old who received a balloon and special treats which she enjoyed very much. 
The host and server were very friendly, personable and pleasant!!! 
The food was very tasty, from the cheese appetizer, to the interesting and cool salads, to the dinner experience with the fondue. I loved the teriyaki sirloin, very tasty......actually everything (and I do mean everything) tasted very good. 
Despite having trouble finds the place due to the GPS, we definitely had a great lunch date."}
{"text":"I've been here twice before. First time I took my mother on mother's day, and the second time we went back a few weeks later just for dessert.

The first time I had no idea that you needed a reservation, but they gave me one while I was there and I just had to come back an hour later. The waiter was EXTREMELY nice and knowledgeable, and almost seemed to love telling new people how things work. I also had no idea that the prices were through the roof, and that it was ideal to order a full course meal.

Never eating at a fondue place before, it was unclear how to cook our food. But once we figured it out, we weren't impressed at all. The meats had no flavor and tasted bland.

BUT, the dessert was WONDERFUL! We got an array of fruits and banana foster fondue. It was amazing! We left broke, but extremely happy and well-fed. Which is why the next time we went, we only opted for the dessert.

The downfall of this place is the TINY waiting room. There's only 5 seats and chances are you'll be waiting a lot longer than they tell you. They don't give you updates on your time or anything, and you can't help but feel like you're standing on top of people or staring at someone without trying to."}
{"text":"LOVED the Melting Pot in Lyndhurst!  ASK FOR HELENA!  She was SO ACCOMMODATING and incredibly friendly.  MADE our experience!  I had all veggies in the yummy Mojo broth & a great salad!

{"text":"Had heard about this place a million times. Always mixed reviews, either people loved it, or hated it. Went this past weekend and really enjoyed myself. It was pricey and the food was good, nothing to rave about but being my first fondue experience I thought it was cool and had fun! Though I wont be rushing back, The atmosphere made for a nice date night and the service was great. I neither loved nor hated it...just liked it!"}

They treat their customers like crap!!

They made me stand in the lobby and wait until my friend arrived. I recommend that you eat anywhere else."}

my only assumption is the food is that expensive because small children in 3rd world countries worked in a food processing sweat shop to get the food over here to cook at your table.

{"text":"This was my first time at a Melting Pot... I thought it was very neat and fun!!! All of our food was good and so was the service!  Loved the dessert also!!"}
{"text":"We have done fondue in our house since the seventies, so I've always been keen on what's involved. The husband, as a child of the late sixties, has never done fondue ever, so I wanted to take him for the experience and to see if we could get a fondue set for the house.

We tried to make reservations for the Saturday after Valentine's day, but the earliest they had was 10:15. So we did Sunday at 5 instead. 

We got the 4 course meals and went to town ordering. We did the swiss cheese combo at the beginning, then each had a different salad. then we did the meat combo with the duck and lobster tail and different steak pieces. For dessert, we did the oreo mixture.

The husband dug in on the cheese but wasn't so keen on it. I liked it, but he found it too gooey and the bread a bit stale. So I could tell he wasn't all that impressed with the first course. The salads came out, and he was happier with that. Then, we got the main course, and with the wonderful smell of the mojo juice simmering on the table, we got to fighting for space with our sticks. He couldn't compliment them enough on the flavors, the tenderness of the meats and the delicious juice we were cooking the items in. He was really impressed with everything from that point on. It really was delicious.

Dessert came and they bring you endless items to dip as long as you still have chocolate left (same with the other courses), so we dipped sparingly at first. Then when the waitress came back, she only had a few things on a tiny bread plate each trip and we felt bad for making her run back and forth, so we finished up. 

Overall, it was a hit and we may go back again someday for a special occasion. At $136 with tip, it's not an every month type of thing for us, but it definitely is a special memory and we're glad we went. 

P.S. the only thing that upset us was that Mary Kay was there, and they came to every table, passing out free items and making you sign up for a \"mailing list\". When I got home 3 hours later, I had a text with the name of someone else on it telling me I had won a free makeover. Yeah, whatever! Melting Pot - don't let those people in anymore! It really detracted from a good experience!"}
{"text":"Melting pot is one of my favorite restaurants. We ordered the classic alpine for the cheese fondue and chocolate fondue. The classic alpine was not what we expected. The chocolate fondue was good after it was remade the second time. 

The manager and the staff went out of their way to make it right for us by re-doing the fondue and providing us with the extra dippings. I appreciate the effort but, i wouldn't recommend the classic alpine in this location."}
{"text":"There's probably not much that can be said about The Melting Pot that hasn't already been said... But I had a great meal here yesterday. We skipped the \"main course\" and had the spinach artichoke fondue, California salads and S'more chocolate fondue. So great and just enough- I didn't feel like I needed to be rolled out of the restaurant. :) Reservations on OpenTable.com are quick and easy. Highly recommended for special occasions!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It is the only one of it's kind in the area.  There aren't many fondue places left. 

Exterior/Location: Legacy Villiage Upper level.

Interior:  They try to keep some ambiance by keeping the lighting low. I reaaly get annoyed when restaurants do this.  I like to be able to see what I am eating and where.  The lighting is all aimed at the centers of the tables.  As far as what the resteraunt looks like... I'm not sure? 

Vibe/Ambiance: It's definatly a \"date night\" kind of place.  It can be romantic and novel all at the same time.  I did bring my kids and there were other kids in the restaurant.  My kids were totally ammused.  It actually made for a very interactive family dinner. 

Staff:  Our server was Colin and he was great.  He explained everything and did a real nice job with the service. 

Clientele:  Mostly adults on romantic dates.  Kids with birthdays.  There were also serveral large parties. 

Price:  I think it's pretty pricey.  My 4 course meal was $36.  They had a vegetarian option!!!!

Must get items:  The desert bananas foster fondue.

Why I love or hate it:  I would go back.  I wouldn't say it's the finest food I have ever had, but it was fun and interactive.

Final thoughts:  It is more about the experience then the fine dining.  The way you eat/cook lends itself  to good conversation with those you are with (hopefully)."}
{"text":"Whether you love to cook or absolutely despise it, the Melting Pot caters to wanna be chefs and \"I don't wanna be\"chefs by offering g a fun, cozy and delicious dining experience where you are pretty much in charge of your food - and you can't mess things up!  It's that simple!

Nestled in Legacy Village, the Melting Pot offers a cozy (or romantic, if you prefer) and clean atmosphere that works for date night, special occasions, or fun family time.

Each table boasts its own \"hot spot\" (not for WiFi -although they do offer that for free) for cooking your meal.  It's \"stove meets table\" and becomes one.

The menu selections are sure to appeal to anyone's tastebuds, whether you're a seafood fanatic (I see food, I want to eat it), a true carnivore (I want the beef, the whole beef, and nothing but the beef), or even a chicken, sausage/pork fan.  They have it all.

And then there's the fondues - both the cheese and the chocolate varieties - and if you order their all-inclusive dinner, you get the whole nine yards - a foodie's nirvana.

You begin by selecting a cheese fondue (we're fans of the beer and cheddar).  It's served with a variety of bread cubes for dipping (even soft pretzel chunks), along with fresh apple slices and veggies - and if you run out of dippage, merely ask for more! At no extra charge!

Next is the salad - choices include standard or Caesar, for example- and the portions are just right.

Once you've completed sampling and dipping and sampling some more (we usually clean out the cheese bowl), the waiter cleans up your \"mess\" and brings out whatever flavored bouillon you choose for cooking your mains, as well as more fresh vegetables (to include red skin potatoes which I love). Let the heating and cooking games begin!

You will receive a brief \"lesson\" regarding how long to cook each meat or fish type (i.e. 1 minute if it swims), and each participant gets different color skewers so there's no doubt who's cooked what.  Then cook, dip in one of the 5-6 dipping sauces they bring you - and enjoy! Need more veggies? Unlimited!

Once you've conquered the mains, some would say the best is yet to come - the chocolate fondue.  There are about 5-6 flavors to choose from (I know - difficulties- right?!).  We usually favor the turtle sundae version with pecans - and the best part?  As with the vegetables - unlimited dippage!  Dipping includes (but not limited to) brownies, blondies, chocolate covered marshmallows, pineapple, strawberries, bananas, Rice Krispie treats (sigh)!

And if you join the Fondue of the Month club, you'll receive a complimentary box of 6 chocolate covered strawberries to take home with you on your birthday.

So if you're looking for a non-rushed, fun, and interactive dining experience, try the Melting Pot."}
{"text":"I love the Melting Pot. When I was in college for four years in Knoxville, it was a regular experience for my girlfriend and I (by regular I mean every 6 months. But for a college student that's a lot, come on). But this location isn't very impressive. The layout was very bland and open. We were facing other diners not in our party. There was little to no music and we could hear everything the 5 tables around us were saying. The waitress near us was basically yelling (unnecessarily) whenever she talked and the servers were not overly polite. Also there was a huge cold draft in the restaurant, I was freezing the whole time. So after all the complaint why 3 stars still? Because the food was still good. Will I be coming back to spend another $150 on a dinner for two? No."}
{"text":"I'm gonna start this review out by saying the hostess and waiter were excellent my complaint is the management or lack of.We had a 300 pm reservation and arrived early and we're seated immediately, the hostess was awesome.There was about 5 or 6 other tables in the restaurant and guess we're we were seated clear in the back next to the kitchen so a nice dinner was out of the question. Staff was loud and playing around in the kitchen, I've seen more professionalism at McDonald s.Another bad thing was it did not appear the restaurant had been swept from the night before ,but guess what they were running a loud  vacuum while guest are paying upwards of $100.00 per two people. I have had nothing but terrible experiences at this location.Most of the staff is great it's more management problems.Have you ever been in a higher end restaurant 2 hours after they have been open only to see food and debris all over the floor now I know this place is dark but when you sit next to the kitchen your under a spot light.And let me point this out as well have you ever been paying a hundred dollar tab only to have 10 minutes of your dinner interupted by a loud vacuum.This location is an epic fail in my book.Stay away."}
{"text":"This was a far from ideal dining experience. The food was on par with previous experiences. I've always felt the restaurant is overpriced for what it actually is, but my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and it's a tradition for us to go to The Melting Pot. When we arrived for our reservation, the hostess had us waiting for at least five minutes even though the restaurant ended up being relatively empty. Upon walking through the restaurant to our table, I noticed a lot of the tables were dirty (filled with plates, fondue pots, and glasses). On my walk to the restroom, more of the same- dirty table after dirty table. Our waiter said no more than what needed to be said about our fondue heating up. And he never checked in on us or refilled our drinks one time even though our glasses were empty. We paid our bill. And on the way out, we noticed all but ONE table were dirty. That's a disgrace. Truly I was appalled that the staff doesn't take more pride in the appearance of their restaurant. My husband and I will not be returning to this location."}

{"text":"The food was great, but the service was incredibly slow and our waitress had an attitude the entire time. We rarely saw her too. The best part of the night was when the magician stopped by to do a few tricks for us between courses. It was a good thing he was there to break up the time since it took almost 3 hours to eat there. We had reservations at 7 and didn't leave until after 10 and that had nothing to do with us sitting around talking. What baffles me is it's not like they were waiting on the kitchen to cook the food since the whole idea behind this place is to cook your own. The terrible service totally ruined the evening for my mother-in-law, who was there celebrating her birthday."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the Melting Pot has always been one of my favorite restaurants and I used to be a frequent customer at the New Orleans location. I visited this location, now living in the Cleveland area, and had a terrible experience. I visited on Valentines Day. I am just now writing this review because I was going to make a reservation for endless fondue this week, and changed my mind based solely on how horrible my experience was. First, we had a reservation for 8pm. We did not get sat until nearly 9pm. I realize they were busy, it being Valentines Day, but that is the reason we make a reservation. We had no apology by management and no apology when I went back to the host stand at 8:45 to make sure we were still going to be sat. Once we were sat, we were at the worst table in the restaurant. No ambiance, right next to the bar walkway/server station. I did not make a reservation and plan to spend $100+ on a meal at a restaurant that is supposed to have an intimate setting for this table. Already upset about not getting sat at or near my reservation time, I asked to move. We got moved to a somewhat better location. The lighting was still extremely bright and we had teenage girls screaming in the booth behind us the entire time. The waiter was nice but did not make the fondue in front of us like I experience at other Melting Pot locations. The dessert seemed a lot cheaper and scaled back than it used to be. I was waiting for a refill on water once we were done eating and finishing our wine, but I saw the waiter heading out of the door with his coat on. Overall, this has been the worst experience I have ever had at a Melting Pot and probably at any restaurant in general. I don't plan on visiting this location again or recommending it to anyone as I typically would


*UPDATE: Sent a direct message with my contact information to the owner one week ago and am waiting for a response. Will update my review if I have another experience at this Melting Pot."}
{"text":"Not a favorable experience.  We had been to another location a few times and enjoyed it.  This place not so much.  The server took his time checking on our table and usually only stopped if i stopped him.  My daughter wasnt going to eat the cheese fondue so we didn't order it for her. He charged us for it because she ate a carrot. $9.95 for a carrot? The server also sloshed the cheese everywhere when he was mixing it up, had some hot oil but my hand and didn't even get a sorry. 
My son didn't like the idea of cooking his food, nor does he eat salad or chocolate as he had never been there before so he decided to cancel his order. When the check came we had to have his order removed from the check even though he was never brought any food. Our server tried to say but he was at the table. 
The chicken was very tough and gross tasting and it definitely needed more than 2 minutes to cook everytime! Might explain my stomach ache today!
For dessert we said we only needed 2 portions as my husband was full but were charged for 3, he said my husband did have some though,  and yep he ate the 3 bananas I wasn't going to eat, we weren't given an extra portion.  So he got charged $9.95 for 3 banana slices! He said the chocolate was ready when he dripped it off but nope it wasn't even warm for another 20 minutes. 
Finally I ordered a white chocolate cappuccino to go with dessert and he said that the machine was broken so I couldn't get one. Funny the table across from us had one after I ordered one.
Also if I'm clearly still cooking my food, have food that is still raw on my plate please stop sending the bus boy by to ask if we are done. 

This location needs some help before I ever return!"}
{"text":"My husband was inspired to plan a date night. Being the fiscally responsible one, I asked him to buy the Groupon for The Melting Pot. We had never been there before. First, we couldn't find the darn place. We had to drive through Legacy Village a couple of times before we found it. Tip: Look up for signs. It's on the second floor. Then came the task of finding the entrance. It's not really near the sign because you have to go up escalators which is where you finally find signage. We had a 7:15pm reservation on a Thursday but it was 25 minutes before we were seated. Once seated there were about five open tables around us so I think we could have been seated sooner. 

So, finally we got our table and things began to improve. Our cheddar appetizer was delicious and I loved that it was made at the table so you know it's fresh. We hated dipping the apples. Apples and hot cheese? Wtf? Anyway... I had the California salad... Delicious! My husband enjoyed the house salad. On to the entree, I had the teriyaki marinated sirloin, pork bbq and andouille sausage. My husband did the duck, ahi tuna and filet mignon. His favorite was the tuna and mine was the teriyaki sirloin. We were warned that the portions were small but we were okay with them. We had the original for dessert. The items to dip are great! 

It was a neat experience. If we could, they'd get 3 1/2 stars. I'm glad we had the Groupon.  I don't know that we would ever consider returning without a Groupon and I'm pretty sure everyone around us was using one too. Our total without the Groupon would have been $98. With the $30 Groupon we still owed $42."}
{"text":"I have a real conflict with this brand. Some of them are good and some of them are bad. This one is right in the middle. It has good food and bad service. I think that it has to do with they way this restaurant is managed. For example if you make a reservation is the same as a walk in. They make you wait in the order you arrived. Why? What is the purpose of making a reservation ? If only the managment would change this restaurant would have more stars."}
{"text":"Great experience!! Justin  out server was really nice and explained everything very well. He made my friends birthday really special. 
This is a great place to come for any celebration or a great date place. Everything is good and fresh."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars


Upon receiving a phone call and letter from the management of the Melting Pot (also thanks to a couple of friends who apparently contacted a national rep of the central management), 3 of the original 4 diners went to the Melting Pot with me for another chance.

Seth greeted me at the door, and we were seated with Carl who was our server.  We got a bottle of Haut Brion 2002 (non Grand Cru), and followed with traditional Swiss cheese fondue with Kirkwasser and white wine.  Salads followed by terriyaki marinade beef, filet mignon, and salmon were next in a coq au vin broth in the fondue.  Lastly, a yin and yang chocolate fondue polished off the meal.

Service was solid, and Carl got marks for attentiveness, positivity and being generally good looking (my friends called him Shuai4 in mandarin) (apparently a plus with the gals).  

I must commend Seth (manager) and Colleen (not sure her title) for their efforts at making sure their service is up to snuff.  I have no idea whether they spoke with the hostess who \"served\" us when last we went, but if they maintain this level of effort at every visit, it speaks highly for their management team."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here to celebrate my birthday. He completely surprised me, as I never heard of this place before and after he told me what it was, I was excited for a new experience. He had made the reservation earlier and we were seated right away. 

As I was looking over the menu and the hot plate in the center of the table, my boyfriend got a sour look on his face and went to talk to the manager. Confused, I asked him when he came back what was wrong. Apparently thet offer a special package to celebrate birthdays where the table gets set up with a card and flowers and none of that was there. The manager agreed to void the cost and I received my (wilting) flowers towards the end of the meal. Although I didn't get a card, i got chocolate covered strawberries lit up with a sparkler and someone came to take our picture. We were told they would come back with the picture printed out. Later to be told that the printer isn't working, so if we wrote down our email, they would send it. Well a month later and they still haven't emailed us. 

Our server was very nice. He explained everything really well, gave us recommendations, and was attentive. The menu is kinda confusing for first time customers so it was nice to have him around. 

This place is expensive. There's no way around it. About $80 for two people depending on what you get, and of course we wanted wine too. The birthday package also cost $50. But you're getting fresh cuts of beef, pork, shrimp, lobster so it's mostly the meat what you're paying for. 

The experience of the cheese dipping and the food cooking was fun and I appreciate trying new things when it comes to food. Plus our server being as good as he was, is the reason this review is a 2 star instead of a 1. The \"fun factor\" doesn't make up for the poor management fiasco. If your customers pay and reserve in advanced for your special birthday package, the manager should follow up with staff to make sure that it's being done. And that is coming from someone who is also in food service management. 

One and done. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Love going to the place. Whenever my wife and 10-year old daughter need their 'chocolate fix' - that's the place we go. Their  Chambord Dark Chocolate Fondue is just great. Even though my 7 year old doesn't understand the concept of fondue just yet, the staff always makes him feel welcome with extra servings of fruits and marshmallows to keep him happy."}
{"text":"It is over priced because the service & food did not live up to that price.

I was thinking it is the same concept as Asian Hotpot or Shabu Shabu, so I was really looking forward to try it when I arrived Cleveland. Oh boy how I get that wrong!

It is nothing similar to Shabu and the taste does not even compare. For Shabu you got meat that is really thin, so you can cook it really quickly and not eating raw food. No, you can't do it here...there will be chances where you get your food out, cut it and it is still raw inside. There is also a good chance you won't be full after eating. The whole dish is like 6-10 pieces of meat (about 2 bites per piece) and couple pieces of veggies. It is a good idea to order appetizer or dessert to fill you up.

Service:
It was good at the beginning. He gave us suggestions and instruct us how to eat it etc. But then our check is messed up. Also, the dark environment with hot melting pot on the table that just takes forever to cook throughout, (if you don't want to eat raw meat), the dinner is going to be 3 hours long and you just feel tired at the end."}
{"text":"Spur of the moment dinner plans with a friend who has been there before. She was very smart and called a reservation ahead of our arrival. I was taken aback when we walked through the doors.

At first I envisioned an upscale eatery with high-class wine and liquor choices. The whole place definitely looked the part. But the foyer was PACKED full with noisy children that look'd to be about high school age. We arrived on time and were told that our wait would just be ten more minutes. I'm okay with that. However ... 25 minutes later I was still standing there and haven't once been checked on our updated to say the wait would be longer than they had anticipated. Poor marks in my book for the host stand. It was a Friday night and they were quite busy ... but handle it. Busy nights happen, especially for an interesting establishment at Legacy. 

Finally fed up with waiting we took the liberty of sitting at the bar... which by the way was completely empty and not once did anyone offer to take us there until our table was ready. The bartender was charming and conversational. Definitely needed a pick-me up after experiencing the foyer from hell. 

Apparently Melting Pot is popular for birthday parties, family get-togethers, etc. OK. Table is ready. Thanks. We are seated with wines in hand. 

The menu has 4 basic premises. The Big Night Out which is a bit of everything and also somewhat seasonal. Fondue appetizers which are veg, fruit, bread dippers into cheese concoctions. Entrees which are also fondue style, cook-it-yourself type of deals. And desserts, also fondue style, which are probably the only reason I would ever go back. 

We ordered a white cheddar and brie appetizer with dippers as our main course. Plenty of food for two to satisfy us. Wines were had. Conversation was enjoyed. Dessert was then ordered. Milk Chocolate and Peanut Butter fondue pot with a variety of fruit and pastries to dunk into the steaming pot of chocolate. That was absolutely delicious. 

So all in all a pretty mediocre experience and quite expensive. I would still recommend going as its definitely a unique dining experience around these parts."}
{"text":"I think the Melting Pot had potential to be something good, if only they had their brains in the right places. They should have made their target audience college students for one thing. Second, prices must must must go down. It's fondue for frickin sake! It takes minimal effort to make, and the amount they charge for it is preposterous. I mean when you get down to it, you are getting cheese fondue (melted cheese) with apple...except it's like 50$. C'mon! I had no idea it was going to be that expensive until it was too late. I will say though, their dessert fondue is to die for. Others were okay, nothing special. A melting pot with reasonable prices, perhaps on Coventry road, would be an instant success with all the students nearby. 

So in short, great idea, bad way of carrying it out sadly."}
{"text":"2.75 maybe....

I recently went to the Melting Pot for a company outing at the Melting Pot.  I have been to fondue places before, and I can't say I'm a fan of them in general.... this experience didn't do anything to help that cause.

We started out with three cheese fondues- spinach and artichoke, wisconsin trio, and cheddar.  The spinach and artichoke was alrigth, but the wisconsin was beer based, and it REALLY tasted like beer.  The cheddar was really sharp, and seemed like it had alchol in it too.  

For our main course we got all the meats (pork, shrimp, chicken, beef, ravioli, pot stickers).  Of all of them, the pork loin was probably the best, but still not anything too special to write home about.  It also came with bottomless veggies (potatoes, squash, mushrooms)

For dessert we got the yin/yang chocolate, fried turtle, and baileys cream dream.  Again, nothing stood out to me as that great, though they gave you a lot of nice things to dip in the chocolate (rice krispies treats, cheesecake, brownies, strawberries, bananas).

Considering the company paid for the meal, I was fine, but this place is pretty expensive.  And I can't say paying this much to make my own food sits that well with me.  This meal is really like a 1-2 hour event.  I'm sorry, but if I were really hungry, I don't think I'd have the patience for this place.  It's a novel concept, but I just don't get it."}
{"text":"Oh and the food was phenomenal! Fondue is my one of my favorite things!"}
{"text":"I was contacted by the manager shortly after my review.  He/she apologized  for our experience and asked us to return so that the restaurant could redeem itself.  I submitted my mailing address, but never received the promised gift certificate:-(. I stand by my original review...."}
{"text":"I love the melting pot!!! It's such a fun experience.. a little pricey but worth it when u can.. better with more people. They definitely need a few more cheese m oil choices though"}
{"text":"Came here with friends for dinner on a Friday night. This was my first experience at a melting pot; I enjoyed the theme of this place and the dipping/cooking experience, but was only mildly satisfied with the food overall.  The legacy village restaurant week menu was a great deal: fondue, salad, and an entree for about $20, and I'm not sure if I would have wanted to pay much more than that considering the regular menu is more expensive. The service was a bit slow, it took about 15 minutes for us to be approached by a waitress, but the waitstaff was very friendly. I had the cheddar cheese fondue, the house salad, and a steak/shrimp/chicken combo, all of which were fairly good. The desert here is the real deal, gigantic portion sizes and absolutely delicious (I would rhighly ecommend the turtle)."}
{"text":"Talk about a fondon't! I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself. It was there for the taking. 

I recently was pretty out of it while browsing Groupon and saw they had a deal for The Melting Pot. I've never been, but figured it might be something fun to try for a date night some time. I was wrong. 

I've never actually been out to eat somewhere and had everything go completely right, but still leave feeling totally and completely dissatisfied.

I cannot believe the racket that they have going on here. On one level, it's kind of brilliant. Charge people completely ridiculous prices and throw them some \"bread\" which is actually a crouton in disguise, bagged veggies, a couple of grapes, some tiny apples, and few meat cubes along with a pot of boiling broth or cheese, and then serve them 6 different sauces out of thimbles. I wish I'd thought of it myself! 

Also, they charged us for REFILLS ON SODA! Even McDonald's will give you free refills.

Had we not had a Groupon, our meal before tip would have been around $90. I could have used that $90 to buy 12 burritos from Chipotle, 11 slices of cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory, 9 movie tickets, or yanno, an entire week of groceries for my husband and I which we also would have had to cook ourselves.

Perhaps the weirdest part of our entire experience was that there was a magician going from table to table preforming tricks. I don't know about you, but I don't think a $30-40 per person meal really pairs well with something that Red Robin has the market on.

We actually left hungrier than we were when we arrived, but our wallet was significantly lighter."}
{"text":"I recently traveled to this area of Ohio and met an old friend at the Melting pot.  I have only eaten at Melting Pot one other time in Novi, MI.  My previous experience was not a positive one, but I was open to trying the restaurant again in another locale.  The atmosphere is nice and there was lots of privacy at the table.  The wine selection is decent and it also tasted good as well.  The server was top-notch!  He was fun, attentive and really had a positive impact on the dinner.  We had a great time.  

The downside is that the food is just not good!  We started with the cheese appetizer and, although initially tasty, was so heavy and full of oil.  The tidbits that come with it were minimal and the raw veggies unappetizing.  The meal was tiny and eating boiled meat is just not very appealing.  

The prices are high!  You would think they would, at least, serve a decent amount of food for the price, but they don't.  For one person, your bill will be at least 40 dollars when all is said and done.  My bill, for myself, was 67 dollars and that was with one glass of wine.  

Although my dinner company was fantastic and the waiter was spot-on, the meal just isn't appealing at all."}
{"text":"An email I sent to management after our dining experience says it all...

Dear Laylonnie,

A couple of weeks ago I decided to make reservations for dinner at your restaurant to celebrate my wife's birthday with my family on 7/9/2013. Though my wife and I had dined with you before, I was skeptical of bringing our children. Prior to making our reservation, I even wrote you an email asking if children are welcome as we had heard from others that The Melting Pot may not be the best place for kids. You assured me that children are very welcome at your establishment.

When we arrived, our server for the evening was Michael. I know that not many people take the time to write about their good experiences, but I'd like to let you know that Michael helped us have a great experience - especially with our kids' first time there. He was very friendly, attentive, patient, courteous, and professional. His busser (sorry, I didn't catch his name) was just as great!

It's refreshing to know that you employ great people who seem to genuinely care about their work and their customers. It's an unfortunate rarity these days and I certainly don't mind taking a few minutes to commend them and say \"thank you\" for doing what you do and doing it well.

All the best,
Joel E.

EDIT on 09/18/2014: I never received a response from the manager. Great experience at the restaurant and I go out of my way to let them know, but they won't even acknowledge my compliment. Poor communication!"}
{"text":"OK fondue - nothing special. Somewhat rude service, but still an alright place for a night out with friends. Nice-size drinks."}
{"text":"I love fondue! It's a big tradition at our house and when I heard about the melting pot I really wanted to try it! The problem is, this place is so damn expensive. I saw a coupon for it on social living, so finally decided to check it out. 

The service was great! We had Dame, he was funny and attentive. You could tell they had a \"shtick\" but he added his own twists into it to make it less boring.

The food was average. The portions were small.... My boyfriend can eat a lot, and i could tell he was disappointed when we got our plate full of meat. He probably could have ate the whole thing himself! We had filet, terraki sirloin, chicken, shrimp, and raviolis. The raviolis were probably the size of a quarter. You only had maybe about 4 ounces of each meat. Both the steaks tasted the same. No seasoning on any meats, and sauces were average as well. You do however get unlimited veggies, and we filled up on those! The most amazing thing of the night? Broccoli.  Before the discount our bill was $163 dollars for two people. I was totally sticker shocked. We had one bottle of wine, and no dessert. For that price, we could have gone to Chez for an amazing meal! Whatever. After my $40 dollar discount my bill was still $90 dollars.... Again, all we ordered was a $30 dollar bottle of wine. The receipt was really hard to read, and reAlly confusing. The company added 18% on to our bill. We left Dame an even 20% for his wonderful service and left. All in all we paid $130 dollars with our discount. This just seems so unreasonable to me for the amount of food, and the quality. I could go to the grocery store and buy all these same items and make fondue at my house! I will not return, even with a coupon. There are much, MUCH better places to eat for the price. 

As for the people who are commenting on here about getting raw food... Yes they serve you raw food and you cook it yourself. It's called fondue. Enjoy the experience! If you don't like it, don't eat here."}
{"text":"Very fun great for a first date or if u have kids its always something to do lol food is really fresh"}
{"text":"Not really the best for the price, the vegetables and meats were the only serious downfall. The water the meat was boiled in table side was flavored, and extremely poorly unfortunately. It was clearly seasoned for the palate-deaf. It had enough sodium to kill a small village. The vegetables were clearly pulled from a bag, rather then prepared on the spot as they should have been.

There were some solid saving graces in my experience here. The Vermont cheddar used in the fondue was pretty spectacular, and clearly had great care put into it. Also, the desert fondue was an amazing experience. 

I've thought about, and will go back here. However when I do go back I'll opt for straight cheese fondue with a baguette. Also, I would definitely do the dessert fondue over. I would avoid the vegetables, and meats based off my single experience. I think this could be a great bar experience, but it's hard to justify an entire meal here based off the tricks up their sleeve."}
{"text":"Communal eating whist cooking skewed meats and vegetables.

There is something magical about cooking in a hotpot in a dimly lit room. The cooking is a group activity; does anyone see my potsticker, what color stickers did I have? It is just a fun experience. The food is fresh and raw. It tastes ok and is pretty pricy but the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Just not a big fan.. 2 of us spent over $100 , I would rather go to a steakhouse and spend less , way less . Too expensive for fondue , sorry."}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing special about this place. The prices are ridiculous for food that you have to cook yourself. I get the fondues and desserts, thats great, but when you pay $40 for little pieces of raw shrimp, chicken, and vegetables that you have to cook yourself...please. Save your money and don't waste your time."}
{"text":"We went again and had excellent service and the food is consistently very good! No wait this time as our reservation was ready and I highly suggest the front room for party's of 4 and the milk chocolate fondue! 

Also, Friday nights they have a magician that visits tables around the restaurant! I really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Went with another couple on a Saturday night. Reservations were at 7:15. The other couple was on their e-mail list and received a deal for \"two eat for $69\". The deal also included a bottle of wine for each couple. Including tip it was $180 for the four of us. Waitress was very attentive. It's a neat experience. I don't think we will go back. It was a tight squeeze fitting four people into our booth. It is very dimly lit. Had to use the flashlight on our cell phones to read the menu. Table gets crowded due to the cooking surface in the center. Portions are rather small. Entree plate contained six pieces  each of the following. Chicken, beef, filet mignon, shrimp and ravioli. Ravioli were literally the size of a quarter. Veggies were unlimited. Extra veggies were brought out quickly. With a one burner table, we were limited to one style of cooking. We chose Seasoned Court Bouillon. You are basically boiling everything you eat. Not the greatest way to cook steak and chicken. The dessert course was awesome. Might go again just for that. One more thing. I would not recommend for small kids. Your basically sitting up against a hot stove."}
{"text":"They were great from start to finish! I reserved a table for My wife and I's 5th anniversary and they were nothing but great, including messaging back and forth with me to get flowers and strawberries ready for the evening. Angel was our server and she did a great job as well!! Keep it up."}
{"text":"Update:  2 weeks after my poor experience I have yet to receive anything in the mail.  1 week ago an owner named Seth called me and said that he will send me compensation.  This is now 2 full weeks after my initial visit, and I have yet to receive anything from The Melting Pot.  Thanks for taking your time guys. 2 weeks later,  STILL WAITING. And as a side note.  I CAN JUST ABOUT SEE THE MELTING POT FROM MY HOUSE.  How frustrating can they be?   Update to come..."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot has been around for years now, it seems. My boyfriend found a Groupon to use here, and since he'd never been, we decided to make a date night out of it. The first time I was at a Melting Pot was probably ten years ago, in Baton Rouge, LA. I say that to say, I knew what to expect. 

This was our first time together at the Legacy Village location. We put in reservations for a Friday evening. When we arrived, three youngsters were manning the hostess stand, and they seemed to be extremely diligent at poking pens and pencils up each other's noses, rather than seating their guests. 

 We ordered a bottle of wine and our hostess had terrible difficulty opening up the bottle. Luckily, my boyfriend is a big, strong, man - so he helped her out. But, was that necessary? 

At any rate, THIS was her only flaw - I promise. She was expert at being attentive and lively. 

The cleanliness of the booth we sat in was memorable for me. And not in the good way. It felt like I was sitting in stickiness and someone seriously needed to Mr. Clean/disinfect/sanitize the cooking surface. And I PROMISE I'm not a germaphobe or a clean freak.  But when you eat out, you just don't want to sit (and cook) in layers of leftover juices.

The food itself was delicious, I got tuna, duck, and salmon to fondue. The portions were filling and fresh. We got plenty of side veggies to dip in as well. Our waitress even came out with an extra bowl (we're massive veggie eaters) at no charge. So, I guess take that as a tip - you can easily get an extra serving of the sides with your entrees. 

All in all, the two stars seem very accurate. \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" The Melting Pot isn't the go-to destination for dinner dates anymore. Clevelanders are lucky because we have so many great restaurants to chose from. I think I can easily speak on behalf of my boyfriend when I say, we probably wouldn't have went if we didn't see the Groupon. It also seemed like everyone else in the restaurant that evening was using their Groupon too. (Maybe that says something? I dunno.)"}
{"text":"Before I get into this not positive review, I want to say that at our old location of Melting Pot we never had a problem. We always had wonderful food and service. But at this location, I wish I could say the same.

First, when we entered, the hostess told us there was a 15 minute wait. We entered at 3:30 PM and there were very few people present and there were multiple booths open in the restaurant.

Then, we saw a server round the corner and tell the hostess that she was ready to seat us, but the hostess continued to let us wait. 

At that point, we searched for Capital Grille's menu. It looked delicious. As soon as we entered Capital Grille, we had a wonderful experience and delicious food. If you're in our same situation, don't wait. Go to Capital Grille.
Thanks for the feedback Seth. However, your hostess did not communicate why there was a wait and if you continue to do business that way you won't have any. And the fact that you can justify poor service doesn't solve the fact that you lost over $200 in business from us. Does your owner know that??"}
{"text":"At first we were a bit baffled on how to make sure the shrimp was properly cooked but not overdone, until I remembered the timer on my cell phone. What I liked about dinner was the variety of veggies and condiments. There were at least 20 little cups of various sauces and spices, most of which were very good. I love the sauce so this made me very happy! More condiments than a bachelor's fridge!! 

(For those unfamiliar with fondue, the table is like a flat top stove, they bring a pot of seasoned broth to heat to a boil on your table, and bring various dishes - diced meats and veggies - to cook in the broth, then fish them out with utensils and eat with sauce). It is rather time consuming, and can be interesting if you are dining with vegetarians.

If you are not interested in cooking, the cheese fondue is very good (comes with veggies, apples, and bread cubes) as is the dessert chocolate fondue. Yes, it is pricey but so is the rest of Beachwood. You are more paying for the experience of the meal than the food itself (which seems easily replicable at home)."}
{"text":"Melt a hole in your wallet.

If you have never been to the Melting Pot then be aware that it's a \"cook yourself\" style restaurant. Meaning there is an electric hotplate embedded in your table, akin to most Korean BBQ style restaurants. How can anyone go wrong with melted cheese? Here's how, charge an arm an a leg for that cheese.

One statement I don't think you'll ever hear me say is \"I have a craving for the Melting Pot\" It's difficult for me to justify the amount of money they charge for quality of the meal that is given. Even if I made a six figure income, I wouldn't be able to justify the pricing tier. 

Going to the Melting Pot is like watching a fun movie where the hero dies in the end.

Don't get me wrong, we had a great time with our friends, the staff was very friendly and it's an experience to try, but only once. However, the prices will keep me away indefinetly."}
{"text":"Update: Since my last post, the issue I had with my previous visit was addressed, very quickly and to my liking. I'm looking forward to dining once again, at The Melting Pot-Lyndhurst!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Monday afternoon for lunch and the service was great.  It is a little bit dark for a restaurant atmosphere, but the service was friendly and the food was delish!  Everything came out pretty quickly so there was hardly any downtime between ordering and stuffing our faces.  This is in a great location which means that after you eat you can walk around and let your awesomely melty meal settle.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Just left from here! We had the four course meal! Was fun if you haven't tried fondue it's pretty cool they do it table side so basically you cook your own meat when your main course arrives! The salad is good has 4 different types to serve your taste buds! Also has a special seasoning for salads or meat. Be prepared to shell roughly $100 but if you're willing to spend it he/she Is totally worth the $$$$ for the experience! Server was a little too busy for my liking. Overall she did a nice job. I tip my servers handsomely seeing as I do similar work. Just enjoy"}
{"text":"Laney (spelling ?). Thank you for making things right for us.  The ying yang and turtle chocolate fondues were superb!  We will be back to give another try."}
{"text":"I'm not a Cleveland Yelper, I come from the San Francisco Bay Area, so maybe my tastes are not quite picky enough.  

The Wife and I were in the Land of Cleve for Thanksgiving and we had an evening when The Girls were to be watched by the Grandma.  I turned to Yelp for restaurants not too far away from where we were, and in spite of the mixed reviews, I am quite fond of fondue and thought I would give it a shot.  I made reservations and our table was ready when we arrived.

I would say that I had every 'negative' experience noted in the negative reviews (we had one of the isolated tables where it's a little bit of a reach to dip your food, the server I think was the one that others had stated 'she didn't care'), and I'm going to disagree with the negatives.

The Melting Pot is a low-light place with a full bar and hot plates on every table. Our server (who was very polite and efficient although not exactly effusive) took our drink orders and returned with the fondue pots and explained the menus.  We settled on a four-course meal (cheese fondue, boullion, chocolate) and it was a lot of fun with the waitress preparing the cheese fondue at table.  

A decent selection of wine was offered and we enjoyed the cheese immensely with bread, fruit and vegetables. I would note that someone had said the cheese was cold...well that's because you need to let it warm up. 

And that's one of the expectations that must be managed; this is not a short meal; plan for at least an hour and a half, but more likely two hours.  Fondue takes time to heat up and you have to use boiling water or it will burn.  So if the waitress takes a little time between orders, it's because she's servicing other diners.  

The entrees were excellent, I had the lobster, chicken, and steak cooked in the bouillon, as did The Wife. The waitress gave us good cooking instructions and we enjoyed cooking each other's skewers.

The chocolate was almost too much.  It's a filling meal, think about it, you eat a quarter pound of cheese, bunch of surf and turf, and then you're pounding down fruit and strawberries dipped in chocolate sauce, and we were stuffed. To alleviate the pain, we capped off the night with an Irish coffee.  

They also set us up well for our anniversary, chocolate covered strawberries and a card, which was a nice touch.

So was it a five star experience?  Just a little shy, above four stars but not quite four and a half.  But unless everyone in Cleveland dines at Michelin star restaurants daily, I'm going to go on a limb and suggest that this place is underrated."}
{"text":"This place has terrible food and extremely high prices. A real double whammy. The service was bad, as was the beer selection. The quality of the cheese and bread was bad. The veg came out of a bag, the meat was exhausting to cook. You can get an amazing meal from any of a number of world class chefs for the amount of money you'll pay here. Cleveland has many great restaurants and this is easily one of the worst. If you really want fondue, I suggest making it at home."}
{"text":"Ummmm. WOW! This place is as good as it is expensive. I know there are a lot of bad reviews but I can only speak from my experience. It was my 1st time here, it was Valentine's Day and my girlfriend set the whole thing up (crazy.... I know!) There is no doubt that it is expensive...$180 for 2 of us without drinks (but read on to see what we ordered!) But the booth was clean, the lights were dim, the service was excellent and the food was really, really delicious. We had all the fixins...the main entree was lobster, filet, lamb, shrimp and chicken. Sooo good. Plus the table had a box of really delicious chocolate covered strawberries with balloons. We had a great experience but due to the price, I doubt we would return. A lot of other great options at half the cost."}
{"text":"I enjoy the experience at Melting Pot, and the food is decent, but there are some serious service issues which need to be addressed. First of all, there is nowhere close by to park if you're not already out and about shopping at Legacy Village. We had to walk a considerable distance just to get to the escalator to go upstairs and keep walking in the cold around the corner to get to the front door. Also, on several occasions when I have walked in, there has been no one standing at the hostess stand to greet me, which is very strange.
On my most recent visit, I made a reservation for a party of 4 and still had to wait about 15 minutes once we arrived at the time of our reservation before we were seated. Once we were seated in a tiny booth with a single burner, we did not see our server again for several minutes. Once he did reappear, he took our cheese fondue order, and then came back within a few minutes with the cheese, broth, and spices to make the fondue. He also brought a tiny amount of vegetables, apples, and regular bread (we had requested both regular and GF), definitely not the proper serving for 4 people. We asked again for GF bread which he brought right around the time we were done with the cheese, and then another dish of vegetables which arrived as they were taking the fondue pot away... As for entrees, it is difficult no matter what to wait for individual pieces of meat to cook for 2 minutes each. It's even harder when you have to maneuver around 12 other fondue forks in the same tiny pot. Bottom line there is that you should demand a table with 2 separate burners for 4 people. Anyway, onto dessert where honestly, you can't go wrong because liquid chocolate makes everyone happy. Unless you have a nut allergy and they bring you chocolate swirling with pecans after you requested for them to leave the pecans out... But overall the dessert was a good experience, with GF cake and brownies offered along with a variety of fruits and marshmallows. 
The story ends with the server bringing us the wrong check, taking too long to reappear, and then waiting until the last minute to bring us \"special\" birthday chocolate covered strawberries which you're supposed to receive as a part of their email club. I received 6 sad looking strawberries in a takeout container thrown on the table as we received our check. Not as impressive as I would have hoped for a $130 meal for 4. With all of the restaurant options at Legacy, I suggest you look around before you settle on Melting Pot. They have some kinks to work out, and while I would understand this happening at a newer restaurant, this place has been around for 10+ years. They definitely need some improvements."}
{"text":"We had a five star dining experience because our server was exceptional.  The food was enjoyable but this chain or concept is not novel.  It was a fun experience still.  I enjoyed the salad with the raspberry vinaigrette and the Wisconsin cheddar fondue.  The shrimp is the best protein to go with because it cooks so quickly.  We had coq au vin broth.  The salmon also was enjoyable.  The tuna and chicken didn't absorb or complement as well with the broth.  I also loved the chocolate covered strawberries we received to celebrate our engagement.  Our waiter was very helpful with recommendations for sauce pairings as well and obliged requests like adding egg to the salad.  Usually I just get a salad and one chocolate and one cheese fondue for more casual meals with friends.  The groupon is a good deal and this is a nice place to celebrate special occasions."}
{"text":"We showed up at 12:20 to have lunch (they opened at noon.) Literally almost nobody in the restaurant. And we were told no to a table because they are \"booked for the day.\"  I actually showed up. Ready to pay. And you turned me away. If I came in at 6pm- maybe I can understand. I could have understood a wait... But again, there was literally almost nobody in the place. Seriously? You're not counting on one single no-show? GM of Melting Pot- You Fail."}
{"text":"NEVER, NEVER, NEVER 

Seriously, this is like the McDonalds of fondue. Lame.

They tried, sorta, to make the place seem upscale. Location, mixing the fondue at your table and all that, but it doesn't cover up the major things missing.

#1 thing missing - good bread. I felt like I was eating Schwebels trashy bread from a bag. It was so obvious that the bread is utter crap. Hello, that is half the meal in cheese fondue. 

#2 thing missing - quantity. Seriously I thought the price was decent until we ate the whole thing so fast that I realized we got hardly anything to eat to begin with.

#3 thing missing - good decor. Yeah they tried once to set the place up, but then it got old and now it looks like a crappy hotel that once had style.

#4 thing missing - knowledge. The people there know nothing about what they are serving. I again felt like I was at McDonalds.

#5 who makes this American? I don't get it. It's like fondue is American???? I can't believe this great dish can get so mutilated by some crappy chain place. UGH I despise this place and will not go back unless it is for another person's special occasion."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just returned home from a wonderful experience. It was our first time going there. Just be aware and prepared to spend money & cook it yourself. We were treating ourselves tonight and went with the 4 course dinner. We started with the cheddar cheese that comes with bread, veggies, and apples. We were not fond of the apples...I do believe they should stop that and replace it with something else. We were very fascinated with cooking our own entrees. I will admit that it was different and did scare me a little bit because consumption of undercooked meats can result in illness. I used a timer on my phone to ensure proper cooking. I chose the steak lovers and my boyfriend chose the classic. The classic had a mixture of meats. I read pervious reviews and people complain about the price..? The steak I had was the BEST meat I've EVER had. I was willing to pay the $36. Our salads were delicious. Desert was fantastic. It's worth a shot! I will return because I had a great experience. My advice (since I am a server) is that the servers seem TOO busy sometimes. They have a lot on their shoulders and a lot to bring to your table. People NEED to be patient with them. Don't expect them to wait on you hand and foot. They do the best they can and are VERY informational and friendly. Bill was $88... NO coupons... $30 tip. Maybe a little overpriced but SO worth it."}
{"text":"It was our first time going there. It was great food and atmosphere. Our waitress was prompt and very attentive. It was a great experience with the different items.to.choose from to.dip into. Will look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Really just okay. The food was okay. The service was okay. Nothing really special. The cheese fondue was average. However the dessert was AMAZING. Other than that everything else was average"}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews and in general, for me, the Melting Pot gets all five stars. I would just note this as a cautionary tale for the owner and managers.

I drove an hour to have a special night and a unique meal. We haven't been to this spot in nearly 4 years! I'm aware that your staff must say the same script multiple times a week, but even bad acting is putting forth more effort than we got from our server who looked like someone just told him his dog died -- even disappearing at one time to \"make more sauce?\"

Our guy, didn't dampen our mood or add a bad taste to the food, but just generally seemed \"over it\" and as if we were his last table and \"omg, they are going to be here forever.\" I would just encourage someone to remind the folks serving patrons that it's an expensive experience and a little enthusiasm, even pretending, goes a long way. Although we weren't brought there to celebrate anything in particular, we were dressed as if we were obviously enjoying our night, albeit a Tuesday. 

There were a couple additional turn offs from our Debbie Downer waiter, but they are petty and I won't get into details, I just hope he split his tip with the 3 other kids who showed up to help serve us. 

I hope someone sees this and reminds the staff that not everyone walking in the door are two high school kids looking for a cool dinner experience on a cheap budget. If the folks LOOK like they are here for a date night or are spending lots of money on food, add a smile and put effort into it. If you don't like your job or serving people, find a new one.

It won't stop me from going back."}
{"text":"I went here last night with my boyfriend and had a great experience! The Wisconsin trio was outstanding!! The little nuts on the Caesar salad were weird but I loved it! The meat portion was good but I was getting full by the time it came! 
I only docked one star because we sat by the kitchen and it was so darn loud and the servers cursing in the kitchen were easily heard! Overall, excellent experience! 
 I understand some people do not enjoy the concept of cooking your own food, but that's what you should expect going to a fondue restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Once for a birthday dessert and another time for a full meal. Let me preface this review by saying that if I were to go back, it will be for a dessert only. And even then I may be kicking and screaming to go somewhere else instead...

Going to The Melting Pot is a an event of sorts. I didn't time it from start to finish, but I now understand why you have to have a reservation to get in. And it's not because of it's popularity, it's because a meal can last nearly 3 hours! 

Everything from appetizers, salads, entrees and desserts all take FOREVER to eat, especially the entrees which can take minutes at a time to cook each single bite. I suppose this all goes with the whole \"fondue\" theme, but I just found it very cumbersome after a while. I can see this place being a popular choice for well off high school kids trying to impress a date, but otherwise, I just don't get the appeal. It's a gimmicky attraction, nothing more. Plus, I didn't feel the ingredients or sauces were all that special or high grade either. For the price, I definitely thought they'd be better. 

Speaking of pricing, I agree with the consensus reviews. It was so extremely over priced, and we even had a coupon. I'm pretty sure our meal (4 drinks, app, entree and dessert for two) was well over $100! Hell, the patrons do half the work in cooking everything at the table, you'd think saving money on not having to staff a full crew of chefs would save the restaurant some overhead they could pass along to the customers. Evidently this is not the case. For the same price, we could've went to Lola for a 4 course meal and drinks. Think about that for a minute. Lola or Melting Pot, hmmm. I feel dirty just mentioning the two in the same sentence. Sorry Michael! 

In short, the food, overall experience and price-point left a lot to be desired. Our server was very accommodating though. The dessert wasn't bad either. It fit the theme and was fairly satisfying. Don't expect much more than that though."}
{"text":"The food wasn't horrible but the restaurant was not my style. The service left a lot to be desired especially at 2:00 on a Sunday afternoon and there were not a lot of people there. The waitress who had 2 tables near mine seemed to be very attentive to her customers whereas the waiter I had (Michael) was pretty much MIA until it was time to pay. It's hard to say if I will be returning to the Melting Pot but, if I do, it more than likely will not be the this location."}
{"text":"Dirty, expensive, small portions, extreme lack of quality, bad taste, and all in all awful. I will never ever go back here again. Take a good look at the grime on the walls...then take a second look at the price of your meal....then watch them bring you out half a potato....and 2 baby carrots chopped into fours....unfuckingbelieveable."}
{"text":"Food was good but our waitress was MIA multiple times.   Our reservation was for 7:30 and we didn't leave until 10:30.   We sat waiting way too long for the next menu item.   What a shame.  Also, if you have a party of 4, you really only need to split two four course meals."}
{"text":"I went once awhile ago and don't really remember that experience.  We went last night for our Fam-A-Versary since we moved to the EAst side recently.  Our server was wonderful.  However we normally go to the one on the West side for New Years Eve and it seemed like the portions were smaller here.  The hostess never asked if we needed any of the specials like balloons etc.  And the girl taking our family photo had no idea what she was doing.  Maybe that is just the photographer in me.  :-)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and we reserved the private round booth but we're sat at a wide open well lit booth and had to be reseated.  We were impressed by the service the other people were getting around us, but very disappointed with our server. We watched the tables next to ours and how they were taken care of and we sat there and wished our server was like theirs. He didn't present the overall menu in anyway and he didn't accommodate us when we asked where the sauce was for the meats he said they don't have that anymore so use blue cheese! He recommended meats that were way over seasoned with pepper, and it ruined the other meats and made everything taste like pepper. :-( Overall the quality and quantity of fruits and vegetables we were given to dip in cheese and chocolate was lacking and a big disappointment. Especially for the price. This was not worth the $150 before tip! We left regretting even tipping the waiter. The value was just not there when it came to the food and especially wasn't there in the service.  The menu and service seems is probably ran from the direction of corporate management that doesn't even eat the food. I was here 3 years before and things were better back then when they had good service and gave more fruits, veggies and better meats with lots of different sauces. This was a terrible birthday experience, but I got a picture of it!"}
{"text":"I have a few vouchers for $25 off a fondue meal and I used one for my friend's early birthday! Service was beautiful they celebrated it as if it was her birthday... our waiter was wonderful. We had the cheese fondue with veggies and bread, the soup base with meats and veggies selection and a chocolate dessert fondue. We also had fresh salads to start our meal with, definitely a bargain if you come here with vouchers or Groupon. It's fun and the only fondue place I know in the area."}
{"text":"I had a $100 gift card from two Christmases ago.  I've been to the melting pot thrice before, which is why I wasn't in any particular hurry to use it.  The last time I went there was a \"spa\" night event...the meal was sparse and a waiter ended up spilling an ENTIRE tray of red wine, mixed chocolate martinis and cosmos on me.  So, yeah.

Anyway, a friend of mine came in from out of town and so I decided that since it's been two years, I would take her here (she really wanted to experience it).  We went for \"The Big Night Out\"

Service:  Hostess was great, our server was excellent.  
Drinks:  wine and cosmo.  standard fare.

Cheese:  Much improved since last visit-got the blend with the bacon and scallions...
Bread: As another Yelper noted, it was poor quality, supermarket-ish.  Ours was half stale.  Veggies were obv not prepared on site (bagged), as pointed out by another yelper. The apples were sliced so small they were hard to dip, so we left those alone.

Salad:  Excellent, with good dressing, bacon and bleu cheese.  We really liked the salads.

We ordered Coq au Vin-style cooking.  No flavor.  We ordered the lobster, shrimp, chicken and beef and some sort of potsticker/shumai was also on our plate.  (We swapped the pork out for more shrimp.)
What was new: They salted/seasoned everything up to 11...it arrived raw at our table and looked like it would be less bland than my last experience.

Wrong.  The coq au vin broth was so bland, it did not add any flavor in the least, but it was salty, which most Americans would mistake for \"flavor\". The broth washed or cooked off whatever spice was on the meat...which is why I think they give you six sauces to dip it all in.   The meat was much higher quality than my last visits, but much less plentiful.  The best thing was the lobster and shrimp.  We left quite a bit on the plate and didn't even bother cooking it all to take home, if that tells you our level of excitement.

Dessert:  The flaming turtle.  The chocolate was good, but had only a tiny sprinkle of pecans (you really couldn't taste them, it did not taste like \"turtle\").  It came with a small plain slice of cheesecake, 2 strawberry haves, 4 coated marshmallows, 2 tiny brownie squares and 4 rice krispy treats.  It was very sparse compared to when this place first opened...my man and I had so much food left over from \"The Big Night Out\" we cooked it and took it home with a huge box for the dessert leftovers as well.

While we were having dessert, our server stopped by and dropped off extra rice krispy treats for fun; he was a nice guy.  We ended up packing much of the dessert away for the husbands and children.  Check, without tip, exceeded $100; we tipped very well for the service and we left.  My friend was happy to have finally experienced the place, I used up my gift card, we had time to catch up...but we were largely unimpressed.  The server and the cheese fondue are the only saving graces, but for goodness' sake, GET SOME BREAD THAT'S DECENT!!!!"}
{"text":"I love going to The Melting Pot it's always amazing the food is always great and it's definitely worth the price! The service is always good and last time it was exceptionally amazing we were there past closing and they still were super nice and accommodating and made sure everything was great for the whole entire meal would definitely be returning to this location can't wait for the next time I'm there!"}
{"text":"My significant other and I went for our anniversary. We made note of our anniversary on our reservation and were sad to find out that no mention of special day was made, especially after seeing other groups with special anniversary and birthday recognition. I know the reservation was read as my allergies were noted as well as my request for extra green goddess. 

I am giving two stars for the attentiveness of the staff to my allergies, although beyond that we were lacking in the same quality. We had three separate individuals come to the table to say we will get you water and then for a fourth individual to bring us water. The wait for the refill was ridiculous as we watched the table next to us get a refill why we continued to wait. When we asked for boxes, we did not get any smaller containers for the sauces or leftover fondue so we were left to pour the warm liquids along the bottom of the container. 

On the bright side, all the food, sauces, and flavors were delicious and we felt like gluttons by the end of the meal. If only there were a way to get large quantities of the green goddess to go.


I have eaten at this melting pot before and have had a much more magical experience with recognition of special occasions and more thorough explanations of dishes. I wish I could say this anniversary was of the same expected quality, but this one fell short. If it hadn't been for the attention to the allergies, this rating would have been lower."}
{"text":"I really wish I would have read these reviews prior to spending my money at this restaurant. We should have known not to eat here when we arrived and there were hardly any tables occupied. That's normally a bad sign. 

This is why I rated this place a 1 star:
1. Menu not the easiest to understand. 
2. For 4 people, we received a small bowl of veggies. It had maybe 2 potatoes, 3 broccolis, and a mushrooms. There is no way 4 people should be expected to share that. We specifically asked beforehand what came with our steaks. We were not told we would have to share a small bowl of veggies. 
3. I don't mind paying for good food and service. However, this food was not at all good. They charge you for a cooking style other than bouillon cubes seasoned water The table has to agree on the same style and everyone is charged for the style (approximately $5). FOOD IS BOILED. There has to be cross contamination issues here when you are boiling chicken and steak in the same bowl. Nothing is seasoned properly. It would have been uneatable if not for the dipping sauces. 
4. We had two servers. One was super nice and the other clearly did not want to be present and was not very patient in explaining the menu. I will give her the benefit though because she's stuck explaining something that is not clear. 

I feel as though the concept of this place is good but it is just not executed properly. It was just
not for our party of 15."}
{"text":"4 Stars: The Service,The Location
1 Star: Everything Else

TLDR: $110 before tip dinner for a regrettable meal with awful standards that The Melting Pot as a whole has designed. The flavors were awful. Someone make a fondue and brewery chain.


Anyway, this is our first time trying The Melting Pot. I've always been intrigued by the concept of this restaurant (just, what I've heard about it) so we finally decided to try it out last night. 

Approaching the restaurant, we weren't quite greeted at the door. There was a gaggle of people (hosts, servers and a few elementary kids that was associated with them somehow). I told them our reservations and they had us seated right away (but that was definitely a disorienting beginning... and the host didn't seem to know what she was doing.)

Our server was Colin, and honestly, probably the favorite part of our experience. He was attentive and helpful, with recommendations and small talk here and there. While we could tell he was also busy with other tables, it seemed he was very good at balancing out his time. 

We both ordered the 4 - course entree (The Classic) with the cheese fondue appetizer and salads. I don't remember what they were, but there wasn't anything remarkable to note. The cheese was served a tad under lukewarm. 10 minutes into the appetizer and the cheese was a little warm... But not much. It was incredibly unappetizing... Picture thick, gooey cheese... It doesn't work very well as \"fondue.\"

To \"The Classic\"...how is it possible to cook your meat completely in lukewarm broth? \"Two minutes for everything except the shrimp, which is a minute and a half.\" No offense to the server, because that's what he's taught to say. Sushi and carpaccio lover here!!! But there's no way you're convincing me to eat undercooked chicken. So wait, did I just pay $40 to throw chunks of meat into boiling liquid? Why yes, yes I did. -_- Note: Liquid did finally come to a boil after 10-15 minutes

The dessert was alright. I learned that milk chocolate mixed with caramel is sickly sweet. The server did bring my SO out some chocolate covered strawberries, for his birthday. That was probably the best part of the entire meal.

Honestly? This entire restaurant chain's delivery is awful. Someone make a fondue chain that pairs with local breweries, please. That's where food like this belongs... Oh, and boiling my meat? No thank you."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! I went here for a dinner with 3 friends after the suggestion of a co-worker. I called to see if we needed a reservation and a friendly reply said \"It never hurts.\" So I made one and whether from the reservation or just prompt service we were seated right away. Our booth was very dark and I mentioned this to the server who graciously offered to switch us to another table but we said we were fine. We ordered drinks, all of which were \"just right\" if you know what I mean. And got 2 of their package meals. The Spinach and Artichoke cheese was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. The bread was a little tough but when it was wrapped in gooey deliciousness you didn't even care or notice. The salads were GREAT!!! I got the California and ended up buying a bottle of the dressing for home! Entree was a bit confusing and we had to ask the server to repeat a few things but we knew what we were in for and had it figured out soon. We didnt bother timing our fondue sticks and all were fine the next day. Honestly the food wasnt spectacular but it certainly was above par and the QUANTITY!!! The plates left us with little room for desert, but when we saw it we quickly made room. Our waiter let us concoct our own chocolate and since we got 2 package meals he let us do 2 different ones! They were both amazing and we left VERY satisfied.

Pros: Quick and attentive service. Manager stopped by and was very sweet. Quantity of food was high and taste was top (especially that cheese!).

Cons: The restaurant is a bit old and worn looking. Not a dirty look, just needs some new carpeting and paint. The bread was a bit tough. The kitchen door was a bit loud.

All in all I will most definitely be back here again!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! I loved the chocolate fondue. They have a lot of options for you to choose from. My bf's fav is the one that will start with a quick flame/fire. It didn't last long tho but it tasted good. I can taste the crunchiness in the chocolate sauce. I think the most important thing about chocolate fondue is the consistency. It can't be too watery nor can it be too thick. I think they did a good job with that, although I think it would be better if it were just a tad thicker. I didn't like our waitress tho because she seems to be rushing us. asking if we were ready right after we sat down and asking us if we wanted to order after 1 minute. Then gave us the bill right after our food was on the table. That needs to be improved. Anyways I would go there again if I'm feeling fancy and want some sweets but I probably won't go there too often because it is kinda pricey for dessert."}
{"text":"The food was great, I was not a fan of the lighting or the impatient waitress though. I felt rushed, and forced to pick something fast. I believe it took about 35minutes to get our drinks (water). My girlfriend ordered a beverage and after the waitress passing our table five times, there was still no drink so we took it off the check."}
{"text":"I won't waste my time with giving you the full experience. We will just say it echoes many other poor reviews. We were here for the first time, birthday girl in tow. Here are the highlights.

- Not at all family friendly. No kids menu.
-Absolutely horrific service. Didn't know our servers name till the check came. Same with the table next to us, we were commiserating.
-Food is just mediocre. I realize I cooked it myself, but the vegetables didn't look fresh, etc.
-We had to ask for an explanation of how to cook the food, what the sauces were, how to properly order, etc.
-The manager stopped by to clear our plates and offer us dessert, because for a while we literally thought our waitress may have been fired mid-meal. Unfortunately, she was not.
-The building is set up for parties. Small, closed off rooms. For a while we thought we were banished to the closet room because we had the audacity to bring a kid with us.

Seriously, just go somewhere else. The experience sounds cool in theory. I assure it is not."}
{"text":"My experience at the melting pot was the worst Cleveland food experience that I have had in a long, long time. It's in the top 10 worst ever for sure. Here are the lowlights. 

Melting Pot is a fondu restaurant in Legacy Village. Their menu includes 3 main options - cheese (appetizer) , broth (entree) , and chocolate(dessert). I had heard that it was expensive, and with two under 10, I had counted it out. However, I ended up grabbing a groupon and decided the kids might enjoy it. 

We skipped the cheese (the whole room smells a bit funky due to the melting cheese) and went right for the entree. We had purchased the 4 person entree groupon and figured if it was good, we might go for the chocolate at the end. We each got the \"Fondu for you\" which allows you to choose 3 of the several meats for your entree. I chose ahi tuna, shrimp, and chicken. I was pretty excited - this sounded yummy!

When the food came out, however, I was sorely disappointed. I take that bad - I was downright mad. The portion was so small that it angered me - that's ridiculous. I wasn't mad because I'm a big fatty - I was mad because even after getting a discount with the groupon, I felt like I was being ripped off. I happen to weigh a lot of my food to count calories, so I am a pretty good judge of weight. My guess is that in total I had about 4-5 oz. of meat on my plate, and that might be over exaggerating. 

The double whammy comes when the veggies hit the table. The menu clearly notes that each entree comes with veggies. However, they fail to tell you that you get one small bowl of veggies per table. So, for our group of 4, we received a little bowl with 1 potato, a few pieces of broccoli, and a bunch of mushrooms. 

To top all of this off, the brother is not well seasoned (and either is the meat) ,so you end up boiling raw and unseasoned meat in unsalted vegetable broth. Seriously?

I paid $60 for the groupon, and that's a really good price for dinner for 4. I felt like I got robbed - highway robbery I say!! 

So folks, this place is a HUGE no no. You might think I am being a bit too harsh. Just before we were seated I was reading a few Yelp reviews and was thinking, \"it can't be that bad!\" Trust me - it is! Save your money and choose any other place in the entire greater Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Our experience at the Melting Pot was exceptional. From the moment I made the reservation (the girl was patient and offered a special treat for the birthday girl) to the moment we rolled out through the door, stuffed.

Our waitress was fantastic. She was friendly and fun, informative and helpful. she had a real focus on customer experience and made sure we were happy every step of the way.

The wine and drink list is ample.  The food choices were plentiful but not overbearing. Our meal was excellent.  The only thing I don't love is that they bring the same pot of cheese whether it's for 2 or 4 people, and we felt that we didn't get as much out of our appetizer.  But we were thoroughly stuffed at the end, so I guess it was ok!"}
{"text":"I'll never return here. I've patronized the Melting Pot at Legacy Village multiple times and this experience was unacceptable. 

I arrived before the rest of my family for a birthday party and was told our reservations were canceled by the manager because we were late. So I waited for my Mom to arrive with the screenshot of the reservation confirmation. No big deal at this point. Thing do happen. 

The way the situation was handled was unacceptable. The manager still insisted we were late, and was very condescending the entire time. Instead of being apologetic, she put the blame on us. She proceeded to tell my Mom, she informed me that she would still seat us. That was a direct lie. I work in customer service, this is unacceptable from any employee, let alone someone running the restaurant.

She seated in a tucked away room that normally sits 4 tables. Brilliant on her part. There was a huge bachelorette party and they were being loud enough to ruin our mood. The manager decided she didn't like us already and wanted to ruin our enjoyment.

They did their best to rush us through our dinner, which is supposed to be experiential. Not so much today. We were flat out told that they were slammed and they acted such.

I witnessed the manager walk past the room point out our table and use our last names. Who knows what she was saying, but it is honestly perception that is most important and she was talking about us.

The food was good and dessert was great. Our waiter did a really nice job. We were supposed to receive a picture with our birthday package, to which we were reminded but nobody ever came to take.

The icing on the cake was when we walked out and the manager turned and made eye contact, yet said nothing. This is how the Melting Pot treats customers who just spent about $300 on dinner? You can't say bye? Or have a nice day?

Food was good. Server was good. The manager had an attitude problem. It ruined our experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful place!  Hubby and I stopped here after a morning wedding since the reception wasn't until evening.  Apparently they had just opened and we didn't know we needed reservations.  We were politely informed of this, but they showed us to a table and explained their menu in full since it was our first time.  We only did cheese and some fruit and had had a wonderful martini, but the prices are astronomical.  For an appetizer and 2 drinks we spent $40 with tip.  We won't be going back due to cost, but the food was awesome and we had friendly and prompt service!!"}
{"text":"Good food as always, but the service was a bit lacking and non-conistent."}
{"text":"My youngest son and I have been to 8 different The Melting Pots restraints in the US. Each one is setup different. Not one of them is the same. We love these restraints and my grandkids too! Our favorite is the cheese fondue. We always finish it off with a chocolate fondue. It takes several hours to eat here but it is worth every bit! Love it!"}
{"text":"We had a groupon that we needed to use, but we like Melting Pot anyways,so we were happy to go.  Our Groupon did not include the cheese fondue (bummer, becasue that is by far our favorites thing!) so we ordered it anyways.  The new pricing is per person, so it is a bit more expensive than it used to be.  Howver, our fantastic server, Vince (Vin?) gave us some bonus cheese and bread!  SCORE!

We also ordered a series of steaks, duck, ahi tuna and lobster.  All were very good, except the lobster tail.  Perhaps I dont like that cooking style?  I wanted to move the pot and cook it hibachi style and was told not to.  Booo on fire safety.

The salads were fresh and good as always, but they stopped using the hot bacon dressing.

We did not get dessert, but had plenty of the leftovers because we had such an abundance of cheese.  Since that is my favorite course, I was happy!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. The waiter even tried to add $15 onto my bill for no reason and then was offended when I asked him to take it off.  The food wouldn't have been terrible if it had cost 1/3 of what I paid for it.  I wish I would have gone to cheesecake factory or claddaugh instead of wasting my time here"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and helpful which was a plus since this was my wife and I's first time to a Melting Pot.  We ordered one of the sampler platters and the cheddar fondue for appetizer.  I must say that although the experience was fun, it wasn't worth the expensive price.  The food was ok, but nothing that would want us to come back.  We did not get the dessert fondue which I suspect would be much better.  The cheese fondue was good though."}
