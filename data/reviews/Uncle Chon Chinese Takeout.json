{"text":"Stopped upon this local Chinese Take-out while I was heading to Sheridan Nurseries and never knew there was another Chinese Take-out place located on Southdown, as I knew Empire Wok was there already and didn't have a pleasant experience there.  

So I decided why not give this a try as I head home after I get some flowers, so I did! 

Most of the dishes are American Chinese dishes and the prices are amazingly affordable with the portion sizes which you are getting were plenty enough compared to other close by Chinese Take-out places such as Empire Wok.  I was able to get 5 dishes +  Egg Rolls + 6 Free chicken balls (from the coupon on their menu)  for less than $ 40 bucks! Now that is a pretty good deal grabber. 

This is considerably a small restaurant with limited decor and with only 2 owners working but the food really speaks for itself and it's it's an amazing place with an amazing service 

As for the food itself, I can say their food is decent, delicious and fresh! I was able to request no sesame oil in the dishes and the lady who was in the front was extremely friendly and loyal and the chef is extremely nice!  The wait time was approximately 15-20 minutes which is not bad but the lady said I can call in ahead to place my order so it will be ready when I come which is fantastic! 

I will definitely head down here and try out their other dishes or dinner menu in the future!"}
{"text":"I am from the States and stopped at this little place. The guy was nice and the prices are fair. I have had a lot of Chinese and I wouldn't say this place was at the top of my list , but makes for a quick easy lunch.  The rice is good but need a little more flavor to the meat and veggies."}
{"text":"I've given Uncle Chon Chinese multiple tries and every time I am left extremely disappointed and disgusted. 
This time in particular, I went to pick up my order and was told they don't give receipts. They forgot to give me my two orders of fried rice. Their 'wonton soup' is watery liquid, long flavourless noodles and 2 wontons. ONLY TWO. The sugai is basically inedible rubbery chicken. Couldn't even chew it. Beef with Chinese vegetable is rubbery beef pieces and bok choy. Again, no flavour and gross. The lady on the phone/at the counter is ridiculous. Terrible service, terrible food, waste of money."}
