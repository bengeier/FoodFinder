{"text":"Loved the loose leaf tea. Meal wasn't my favorite, but I got an egg dish and apparently they are more known for sweet breakfast dishes such as pancakes etc. The two people I went with both got pancakes and they enjoyed them"}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. Very loud indoor atmosphere and poorly shaded outdoor eating area. The waitress never checked back with us after taking our order and our glasses sat empty on our table for the duration of our meal."}
{"text":"The menu at this place was almost too much. I wanted to try it all. I opted for the pancake flight (try the peanut butter cup ) their house made chicken sausage was also amazing. Cool retro decor. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I really loved this place. Decor was cute and the food was fantastic (I had two types of the various eggs benedict offerings...both amazing). I would just recommend to the owners to not have seating so close to the ping-pong table. Although I personally could handle the sound of the table, my mom became annoyed. Also, people were constantly asking us to pick up wayward ping-pong balls that had rolled underneath our table. Next time, I will make sure we ask for a table somewhere far away. But, that said, can't wait to go back. :-)"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended, so i was excited to try it. There was a slight wait, but nothing too long. Once seated our waiter took our order and then disappeared. It took forever to get our food. It turns out the waiter forgot to turn in our order! Ugh! When the food arrived, it was merely marginal, and certainly not worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and tasty.  I'm having second thoughts about whether it's worth the wait or not.  It's typically chaos by the door when trying to check in and the staff has no idea who is next."}
{"text":"Finally Tempe has a breakfast spot.  Snooze clearly prides itself on being more than just an eatery.  Great food, atmosphere, and SERVICE!  Highly recommend the corned beef hash and danish blueberry pancakes!  Every member of the staff was dancing and smiling, again, truly an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Came back and was super happy all the way around. Perfect eggs, great service, and smiles."}
{"text":"Came down to AZ for some baseball spring training. We stayed in Mesa and relied on yelp to help us find good places to eat. We found snooze a.m and it was delicious. The staff are great and friendly. The food was suburb. I got the breakfast tacos ( added bacon and jalape√±os for the extra taste). The portions are good. If you are in the area, definitely stop by."}
{"text":"I probably will not go back to Snooze due to the deafening noise. We could not gear our own conversation. There was no music it was just the building design. I did not care for the flavor of the hash brown potatoes. Poached eggs were fine. Asked for crisp bacon, was severed to me almost raw, they took bacon back and brought crispy bacon back."}
{"text":"Snooze is the ONLY breakfast restaurant I know of that has a wait for their bar. Went to Over Easy instead. Change your bar wait policy and we'll try your establishment."}
{"text":"How the mighty have fallen. :(  I reviewed this restaurant several months ago as I was making it my 'go to' daytime restaurant.  I had a couple of not so great experiences but at least I had an experience.  True, I had visited during quiet periods so service was always good.  Today is my birthday. A friend asked me where she could take me for lunch and I eagerly said 'SNOOZE', please.  She arrived first at 11am and requested a table for two. She was told there would be 15 - 20 minute wait.  I arrived at 11.20am.  By 11.30am we started to get hungry. My friend also noticed others who had come in behind her were being seated. At 11.35am she asked the young hostess who discovered she had removed the table request as the number was no good - she had taken down the wrong number.  Her apology was lacklustre and blase. We were promised a table 'soon'.  We waited another ten minutes until the crowds thinned and everyone behind us had been seated.  A rude young woman approached and said we were 'at the top of the list'. She was anything but apologetic.  Perhaps we were too old for Snooze?  By that time we had had enough, our feet were tired and I was holding a birthday bouquet of flowers.  We went to Grassroots where we should have gone initially. So many fabulous places in Central Phoenix and we chose Snooze.  Never, ever again.  So disappointing.   On the other hand, Grassroots, whilst not a breakfast eatery, provided delicious food and outstanding service."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and it was fantastic! My aunt and I were debating on what to have and decided to split a scramble and French toast. The waiter was amazing and informed us we could have two different French toasts as one order. We had the OMG and the Neat. Both were absolutely wonderful. In the scramble we had mushrooms, bacon and cheddar. The bacon was good quality, thick cut and the veggies were fresh. All of the food was great but the service really got me hooked. The waiter was so helpful and friendly. We told him we were splitting and he thoughtfully split it all. So sad that I'm from out of town and not able to enjoy this great breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Went to Snooze Sat 10/17/18 at 8AM. Seated quickly, attentive service, good, hot coffee. Ordered the Eggs Benedict - Bella!Bella! Benny. Food came out quickly. Hollandaise sauce was tepid to COLD.  Return visit to Snooze Fri 10/23/15 at 9:30 AM. Busier - still seated quickly, all staff friendly, quick and efficient. Ordered Juan's Breakfast Tacos. Food came quickly. The hash browns in the tacos were hardly cooked - almost cold. The green chile hollandaise sauce was tepid to cold   Are all the sauces here supposed to be served cold?   The food would be awesome here, but what is the problem with food temperature?   Great location, great atmosphere, awesome service, food LOOKS fantastic - Work on food temperature."}
{"text":"Walked by several times over the years and wait time was always at least 45 minutes until we finally got a table. Sorry it wasn't busy, because I would have preferred not eating here. Eggs were bland, toast was tasteless, and the hashbrowns was like eating pure pepper. Bleh. Wife's cornbeef hash wasn't any better and when we got home, we both felt sick for the rest of the day. To make matters worse, the booth we were sitting at seemed to be very low and caused both my knees pain for hours.  For the price of one plate, I can cook a much tastier, healthier, and completely better breakfast for 8 at home. Hopefully my review doesn't stop anyone from eating here, because if you are willing to wait that long for overpriced, bland food, that's fine with me. More space in restaurants that actually deliver flavor."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Food is great. Service is hit or miss. It's a clean restaurant. This location is around the Biltmore area. There's plenty of parking in the plaza. I plan on visiting the place when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!  The wait was long but worth it. I had the pancake flight and it was delicious. Pear, Sweet Potato and Blueberry were my picks. And the Mmm Mmm Mimosa was sublime. I can't say enough good things about how good this place is. I wish I lived closer but I'd probably weigh 300 lbs real quick.  Go now - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Over rated.... The food was ok I have had waaaay better at mom and pop shops. Was also way overpriced. $9 for for two slices of French toast. If I wanted anything else like eggs or hash browns I had to order seperate :/. The only good thing I can say about the place is the food was presented well. But that's about it."}
{"text":"Great little eclectic spot for breakfast, brunch or lunch. I wanted to try somewhere new to me and wandered in here - glad I did. The music took me back to the early 90's and the food took me where I hadn't been before. Interesting spin on old ideas. The selection is fantastic and the prices won't break the bank. Great service too and the bathrooms were very clean. They obviously take pride in their work here. Highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"Amazing service, ambience and food. The waiters are helpful and happy and the food is always, always good. Super busy usually though, so be prepared for a bit of a wait - but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Always a busy place, has a pretty big menu with some creative items. Gave me the daily pancake for my birthday which was super sweet of them, the pancake was amazing, very dense and chocolaty, a few bites in and I was satisfied. They have mix and match options for their eggs Benedict, but I wasn't super impressed by them. The flavors seem fun, but they definitely lack in flavor. The hashbrowns are the worst I've ever had at a restaurant, and I love hashbrowns so that was a big turn off for me. I wouldn't choose to eat here again, but some of my friends are obsessed with this place so I may return with them if they are persistent about it."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday morning with two very active toddlers.we were seated within 15 minutes and the kids didn't want to go inside since they were entertained with the chalk and toys in the patio. Server was okay, not rude just seemed a bit overwhelmed. Our order came out with in a decent time, and the food was dekiciius. The breakfast burrito was very big that I needed a to go box. The kids plain pancakes were so fluffy they didnt need extra syrup. Overall the food was delicious service was okay and we will be back."}
{"text":"Always get a pancake (or 2) to share for the table. The cinnamon roll pancake will never disappoint and they always have a pancake of the day which is usually a good choice.  If you are a fan of Benedict's, you can mix and match and most are pretty good. I usually stick with the breakfast burrito or taco's. Add some pork on either of those and you'll be happy you did. A little hipster for my taste, but the food is always on point so I can look past all that. They just need to open one out in the northwest valley!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and the food was very good to excellent, although sadly I have to knock off a couple of stars due to some poor customer service which I'll get to in a bit.   First the good, I had the corned beef hash which was very tasty and so much better then the standard hash you get from most breakfast places. At the table we also had eggs benedict which were great, and the french toast was some of the best I've ever had. The coffee was above average for a breakfast place, and the prices overall were reasonable. The juices tasted freshly squeezed the overall quality of the food was great.  Apparently there is often an hour wait when ASU is in session, but with school out the wait was only 10 minutes or so.  Now to the aforementioned downside. My partner ordered some chorizo along with his breakfast. When we got the bill he was charged double the amount listed on the menu. When he brought it up to the waitress she got the manager who pointed out a section on the back part of the menu where the same item was shown with the increased price, then attempted to explain why sometimes it costs more and sometimes it cost less. When he pointed out there was nothing on the menu to indicate one vs the other we got a big eye-roll, shrug and the manager left without another word. It was only a difference of a couple dollars on a 60 dollar tab and an easy fix for the manager but the blow off left us annoyed and unlikely to come back, despite the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Met a friend here around 1130 on a weekday and sat at the bar. Only about 10 other people there so not busy at all. The bartender/waitress actually commented on how slow it was that day. My friend had the Bloody Mary with siracha and I had one of their cocktails (can't remember the name, but it had tequila in it) and both were very good! I got the chili verde benny and it was delish!! The hashbrowns were ok, but for me combined with the benny a little much. I learned I could get fruit if I wanted...next time! My friend had the strawberry spinach salad, a bit small for the price and had no protein. Would go back again!"}
{"text":"Great place! Fun atmosphere, fresh and local when available! Made the breakfast tacos vegan and they were awesome! Have tried to go back and the wait has kept us away but hoping to go back once the buzz has calmed. Yum!"}
{"text":"Food good, service is good. Be prepared to WAIT. Try the pancake flight and Bennie combo with another cake subbed for the browns (at least 4 us, I like crisper browns) on the first visit so u get to know the menu. Brewmosa was good (beer and oj). Good shade outside, sat comfortably outside on a warm September mid morn."}
{"text":"Way overrated breakfast spot. That they attract a crowd proves the adage of \"location, location, location.\" There are much better choices nearby, including Daily Dose and the new First Watch tucked in next to Tarbell's"}
{"text":"Food Taste: Food tastes good, fresh. What to order: spuds delux, omg french toast Price: average Atmosphere: amazing outdoor seating if the weather is nice Service: good"}
{"text":"Our first time visit was amazing. I ordered the pancake flight, which was delicious. My wife ordered the breakfast burrito, and it was delicious also! We will definitely be back. Great food, great service, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The wait was worth it! The food was delicious, and the atmosphere is great. So many unique dishes and great service."}
{"text":"PSA:  pinapple upside pancakes sound good in theory only.   After waiting 15 minutes to be seated,  another 15 to get coffee, and another 20 to get food this is my review. 1.  Waiting that long for breakfast on a Thursday...really?  I'm disappointed in myself for this one.   2.  Pancakes smothered in white sugary glaze, cinnamon butter, and pinapple pieces is just ew. 3.  Coffee was OK. 4.  Ordered a scrambled egg on the side.  It was cold and rubbery.  5.  I'll stick to plain butter and maple syrup next time.  If it ain't broke don't fix it."}
{"text":"Love the setting and the fresh new way eggs and pancakes are presented.  Options galore... You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We sat outside on a perfect morning in Tempe.   Our server was Gloria and she could not have been nicer or more efficient.  If i was the restaurant owner, i would be blessed to have someone like her working for me!     I had the corned beef hash and my wife and daughter had the breakfast tacos.  Both were awesome. .."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere.  This is a breakfast bar with with a retro, healthy, save the planet attitude. Food is not super healthy, but you can coordinate your own style if needed.  Taps and bottles all Over the breakfast bar make his a trendy red eye joint perfect for your morning after recovery.  ?"}
{"text":"Ate here on the recommendation of a friend and was very impressed. The food was fresh, delicious, and quick - even with the packed-to-the-rafters brunch rush.  The wait for the table was a bit long (72 minutes) but well worth it.   I had the Huevos Rancheros with chorizo. And I'd have it again, and again, and again"}
{"text":"Just in town one day and breakfast is a must in my world. I always try to find local joints in which to eat and the reviews on Snooze are outstanding. The menu is too vast to order just one thing but my waiter, Phil, hooked me up with some recommendations. I ended up getting the breakfast burrito, but Phil knew I was struggling with that decision. He therefore took it upon himself to send out a mammoth pancake on the house. His service was outstanding and the food was unbelievably delicious!!"}
{"text":"Overrated.  One bad experience then gave it another chance. Tried again and same bad experience - mediocre food. Service good. Food lacking. Won't go back. The location at Kierland much much better."}
{"text":"If you want a below average meal, this is the place for you! I ordered the standard ham Benedict. The whole meal was cold. The English muffin was rubbery. The ham was super dry. The poached eggs were overcooked. The hollandaise sauce wasn't enough to even cover one of the sides of the dish, and it was nearly flavorless. The hash browns were bland and undercooked, and definitely came from the freezer. What a disappointment. I can only suppose that this restaurant has so many good reviews because the majority of people there were college students who may not quite yet know what good food is supposed to taste like! Two stars instead of one because the waitress was awesome."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant!!! The waiters and waitresses were super polite and tentative. The coffee was strong enough and the food was pleasing to the palate. It is perfect to take the family. They have outdoor seating and is nice early in the morning. This place is definitely all around trendy."}
{"text":"Only have to day that the beat sandwich is one of my favorites! I also tried the drunken monkey french toast!! I am a big french toast fan and it is by far one of the best I have had in a while... perfect place to start your day!!"}
{"text":"Oh my, what I say!  The food is well presented and delicious, although it could have been hotter.  Best breakfast in the Valley."}
{"text":"I know this place is quite popular but my breakfast and service were sooooo \"meh\": The waitress wasn't sure what herbal iced tea was so I ordered herbal tea and a glass of ice. The tea came with no explanation of what kind it was and it definitely was too strong to be herbal so I didn't drink it. Never got the glass of ice. Ordered scrambled eggs, toast, hashbrowns and chicken \"sausage \". The latter was a misshapen patty that I couldn't eat. I tried two bites and it had an odd flavor so I skipped it. The eggs and toast were okay but only marmalade for the toast was served with it. No other options.   Had to wait quite awhile for the check and the place was NOT busy. My stomach was upset for about three hours afterwards. Not going back. Ever."}
{"text":"Love the pancakes. Definitely encourage the three pancakes options, don't miss the sweet potatoes and pineapple ones. Amazing."}
{"text":"Such an awesome place to eat at. I came here from California to visit my sister & our server Rylie was so sweet. The drinks & food are amazing! We felt so welcomed here definitely will come back here again."}
{"text":"So completely blown away! Snoozes incredible, high quality, fresh twist on breakfast favorites, such as hash browns and pecan pancakes, is enough to equate to a five star rating. Now add Snooze originals like breakfast pot pie, and egg, pico, and cheese breakfast tacos. YUM!! Though I have to say, the thing that completely set my experience apart was the outstanding service. Our server was Jason over at the Gilbert location. He was incredibly personable, energetic, and treated us like we were the only ones there. This guy seriously made our experience at Snooze and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Good  food but the drinks are too expensive. Wait is usually an hour but the service makes it worth it. Pineapple upside down pancakes and the breakfast tacos are the best things on the menu IMO"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! We stumbled upon it as it was next door to the hotel we stayed at the night before.  We got in with only a 10 minute wait on Sunday morning and it was Mother's Day. Free, excellent coffee is offered while you wait for your table.  Our server Claire was  great! The menu is fantastic, lots to choose from. Their spins on eggs benedict is creative and tasty. Pancakes were amazing, and they offer a flight of pancakes so you can taste 3 of the different types so you don't have to choose just one of the delectable pancakes offered. They have quite the drink menu as well (adult beverages). The service is quick and friendly. They even charged my dead phone for me while we ate. I will definitely go back and highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I had the smashin punkin pancakes and they were amazing! They had cream cheese were light and fluffy and the seeds on top were a perfect addition."}
{"text":"Quoted 65-75 min on a Sunday, waited 1:45. Checked in w hostess twice who said were running 12 min behind. No apology or explanation, she just kept pointing to her ipad. When checking in the third time we were told they texted us six minutes ago. No text, hostess wrote the number down wrong. Hostess never came to find us, even though we'd asked her twice where we were in line. Do better hostess, it's your job to find us-esp when we've checked in. You know who we are. The girl bussing our table was super slow, no sense of urgency whatsoever. I felt badly for our server, who was walking into a hornets nest. But then she didn't bring us water for 10min, so that feeling disappeared quickly. But she was super friendly, so she deserves credit for trying to rescue our experience. The food arrived fairly quickly but in batches and was not hot. Can't explain that one. Egg whites and pineapple upside down pancake were late or forgotten. The manager never stopped by once, but to their credit we never asked for a deal of any kind either.  We're from Denver and the Snoozes there are much better than what we experienced in Phoenix. Note: Our family owns a steakhouse and knows what they're doing. This group failed us. Especially when a family waits so long. No accountability for our experience. Do better."}
{"text":"Long wait but worth it.  Love the pancake flight. One of the best breakfast places in the area."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  A breakfast place with a variety of benedicts you can mix & match, ping pong, cornhole, AND they serve cocktails?  I thought I died and went to heaven, this place could be dangerous.  LOVE IT."}
{"text":"Food was bomb... We ordered the Benny duo which our pick was half of Benny Goodman and half a chili verde Benny 4 us, very good food and well worth the wait!! We also tried the upside down pineapple pancakes n cinnamon roll pancakes which were nothing short of excellent. Love this place and can't wait to come back to try different things on the menu Jessica our waitress was phenomenal!! Mimosas and Bloody Marys were also great too!! My new addiction"}
{"text":"Hip hop music, slow rude inept staff from the bottom up, bland food.  Maybe Saturday at 9:15 is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best pancake I've ever had in my life. Every time I go I get the pancake of the day cause I know it won't disappoint! If you are looking for a good breakfast place in Tempe I highly encourage you to look no further. Snooze is everything!!"}
{"text":"We will never go there again. We waited for an hour once we sat and our order was taken we waited again. When the server brought our breakfast my eggs were cold, the tortillas were cold and my husband meal eggs with chorizo had not taste. As we were leaving we asked to speak to the manager and asked if the had a card to give my review and he said to go to yelp and write. He asked was there an issue and I told what my concerns were and all he said \"OKAY\". I expected to hear I'm sorry to hear that please give us another try but now. I do not want to spend my time or money here!! It is also overpriced!!!"}
{"text":"Super yummy!! Great food, service, and environment."}
{"text":"Well, I was super excited to try their breakfast, but it was an extremely long wait. People who arrived after us got a table before us. We ended up leaving. You can't really snooze when you're coming to this place."}
{"text":"Great food.  Could not decide on sweet or savory ... So our party got some of each and shared.  Coffee and donuts Pancake was really good.  Service was excellent.   Just visiting Phoenix but it is on our list to visit when we come back!"}
{"text":"Makes me feel like I am back in Denver.  I used to live in the heart of the city and this place was always packed - great food and service. Bring a friend, kick back and enjoy some Mile-High hospitality!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch and was not disappointed.   I ordered the Chilaquiles Benedict with a spicy Bloody Mary.   The Chilaquiles were served as two croquet type servings, two tortillas with the toppings piled high on top. The helping of Barbacoa was fairly generous and really tender. The egg was done perfectly and the fresh chopped tomato salsa was really fresh. They aren't spicy but some Jalape√±o Tobasco helped with that. I felt the portion was just right but if you're really hungry make sure you get hash browns on the side to fill up.   The Bloody Mary was OK. The mix they use is somewhat thick and spicy wasn't really that spicy. They also use a lot of pepper which I'm not personally a big fan of.   My wife got the Pot Pie which she devoured. The crust was soft and flaky and the gravy had great consistency as well. She had a mimosa with cranberry and lemonade and absolutely loved it.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After a 30 min wait to b seated and another 30 min till served, long wait for  the worst breakfast I'v ever had. Ordered the Breakfast Tacos added a Pabalano pepper,got a jalape√±o cut in half   raw with seeds, not warm not roasted not Pabalano . No sauce in the Tacos like the menu described, condiments delivered with empty ketchup bottle, asked for replacement never got it , had to get up and find it myself.Food is not at all special. I did speak to the management, took my meal off the bill, offered a gift card,I declined as this is not a place I will try again."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! We have 2 young kiddos so we only eat in with them every other month but we order the pineapple upside pancakes every Saturday. The pancakes are AMAZING and to still be good when you get them as a Togo really says something. I also have to point out how amazing this restaurant is, a couple times I picked up a Togo with my kiddos and my youngest was sleeping in the back. They were more then will to give me curb side service even thou that is not something they offer. They go out of their way to make all their guest enjoy Snooze.   Now my husband and I eat there once a month without kiddos to sit and enjoy breakfast (you have kids you know how amazing this is) the host staff is fantastic Kris a hostess is always so cheerful, sweet and warm she always remembers us and is always so friendly and she has never made us feel rushed when adding our name to the wait list. The wait times (can be long yes but worth the wait) are always on schedule we have never had to wait longer than said. Natalie another hostess is such a sweetheart she remembers us by name and always ask how our kiddos are. Her conversations are of friends not a hostess which I enjoy. When our kiddos do come she goes out of her way to make them happy and enjoy their meal. Katie is the server we have had the pleasure of sitting with she is so fun and knowledgeable about them menu. She answers all my questions about the menu (which tends to be a lot since I'm vegetarian) she is also very tentative to our table. She never lets our drinks get empty and checks on us throughout the meal. Everything we have tried here has been amazing! I highly recommend the breakfast taco the are to die for (thank you Katie!) We always enjoy eating here between the service to the atmosphere and cleanliness and finally to the food we never leave unhappy."}
{"text":"I write this review in the vain hopes that they'll expand to Seattle!.  Having patronized several of their locations in Colorado, I was so excited to see them open up only a few miles from my previous downtown home.  To be honest, I've only ever eaten their Benedict, but it's just that good!  Please, please, please, expand to the Northwest!"}
{"text":"Reilly, our server was super fun and awesome to our table"}
{"text":"Cinnamon roll pancake = easily one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten...perfect pancake, and I am a pancake fanatic so this is saying something...pretty good service too but be prepared to spend some time there."}
{"text":"Had a layover in Phoenix for a few hours and decided to explore the area and grab something good for breakfast. This place is great! Awesome creative take on traditional breakfast items, breakfast cocktails, great indoor and patio seating near ASU campus."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I've been to both this, and another location, in Denver. Never had a bad experience. The place has a fun sort of 60s vibe to it. The outside patio has games for the kids, or for those who're kids at heart, as well as misters, to temper the Phoenix heat. There's a wide range of cocktails, for the adults. Food-wise, the hash browns aren't crispy, but are very well seasoned. All of the eggs dishes my guests and I have tried have been perfectly cooked. The bacon they serve is thick and meaty.  There's not a lot here, if you're not looking for breakfast foods. This can be a bit frustrating, if anyone in your party is looking for lunch rather than brunch. The wait can be an hour or longer on weekends, so it's not the best place for an impulse brunch."}
{"text":"The flavored pancakes are incredible! We also got some kind of poached egg breakfast with delicious brussel sprouts.  They have very interesting combinations which all worked well together. All four of us cleaned our plates. Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Festive place with excellent food and friendly, high energy staff. Chilaquiles Benedict was really yummy, and the signature pineapple upside down pancakes are a crazy good. Thanks Savannah from Clarkston Michigan! Making your parents proud."}
{"text":"My hubby, daughter and I enjoyed a lovely brunch at Snooze yesterday. We are excited for them to open in Scottsdale, near where we live. I must say the art deco, bright ambiance gives the proper anticipation of a fun meal. I started with an MMMmmm Mimosa which was light and lovely. Carlene, our server, made the entire experience excellent. She even had a whimsical bacon and egg hair clip that she made. Shows you right off the bat, she loves her work. Since it was our first visit she brought us (on her) the pineapple upside down pancake with cinnamon butter. I don't even like sweets, but it was DIVINE! We all scooped it up. Our sweet daughter had the tomato soup and grilled cheese, which she loved. The soup almost tasted like a marinara. Very fresh and delicious. I had the lox, rye, capers, herbed goat cheese, and arugula plate. It was very good. My husband had the corned beef hash. It came out cold and they immediately retired it and made it right. The manager( forgot his name- glasses and a ponytail) did a great job of assuring that it would be perfect the next time.   All in all, we are not going to want to wait until the end of August when Kierland opens so we will be back. BRAVO! Laurie and Rodney Malone"}
{"text":"Awful.. Waited 45 mins and got a text that my table was ready and it wasn't?? Very unorganized!"}
{"text":"OMG! From the moment when we arrived, I knew this place was going to be good!  I didn't mind having to wait nearly an hour before our name was called and we took our seats! Since I'm not from the Phoenix area, I have not heard of the breakfast offerings at Snooze, but I was pleasantly surprised! The retro decor was a nice surprise and wait staff was attentive and very helpful on this our first visit. I had the OMG French Toast and it was very delicious. So delicious that I forgot to snap a picture  of my plate before I indulged in the sweet goodness of the dish.  The toast was moist, not overdone and full of flavor. I also noticed that it was just the right amount of sweetness for my tastes.  To drink, I enjoyed a latte.  I forgot which one exactly but it was pleasant and just as good. I enjoyed this visit and will definitely visit them again!  I only hope that they open a location in San Antonio soon!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the Breakfast Pot Pie was to die for. The mimosa's were not good though.. Way more juice that what we paid for. 8-9 dollars per glass."}
{"text":"Very fun place to go for breakfast or brunch. Their \"OMG! French Toast\" is SO YUMMY! And they have delicios mimosas too! Sometimes I've been and received slow service; but always enjoy their food."}
{"text":"The food has been consistently good all the times I've visited. It's the service that's an issue. We got a table after a 15 min wait. We were seated in a table right next to the bathrooms. I usually don't have an issue with this but each time the doors swung open we caught a strong whiff of whatever was going on in there. I requested the server, very politely, for another table. She said the only options were 3 chairs at one of the communal tables or be put back on the wait list for a 20 min wait. There were tables clearing out all around us. There was no reason they couldn't have switched us to one of the other tables and given someone else our table. Very disappointed. I will explore other locations of snooze in the valley and give the Tempe location a wide berth."}
{"text":"Good - I like the decor. The staff seated us quickly. The menu has some very tasty items.   Bad - no paper towels in the men's restrooms. Makes a person wonder about the staff hygiene issues...  Asked for a straw with my water & got a condescending \"we try to conserve\" from the server. She never produced the straw...had ask another staff member & he produced them with them in his bare hands. Gross!   Coffee was good but could have enjoyed more without all of the coffee grinds at the bottom of my cup...grr! Mentioned it to my server...only got a apology.  Any manger will tell that coffee should have been comped...  Sausage was cold.  While portions were adequate, it didn't make up for the poor service."}
{"text":"Good food with a flair! Solid, friendly service in a hip atmosphere that manages to stretch almost to the edge of being cheesy yet it works. We will be back when in the area for sure."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Music was nostalgic pop from the 80's mostly. Fun decor/ atmosphere and friendly service. However, probably would not return again."}
{"text":"Great service!  Tasty food! A great place to eat;  I recommend earring here but they do closer early (2:30)"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Reasonable prices. The pancakes and breakfast pot pie were big hits.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place was awesome as a person in the business for over 30 yrs I feel this rating was definitely warrented.  The entire crew were on their game with teamwork and ensuring that every guest was taken care of. The personal service we received as a group of 7 guys who had a very long weekend went above and beyond . If you read this review and don't go your a fool this was by far the best breakfast I've had and ranks near the top for service . The Manager Chris I believe sorry if that's wrong bearded guy working the front came to our table welcomed us told me about his restaurant like it was his own. This guy is a keeper loves what he does and it showed great great great job hope I can get back there again soon maybe the ones in California near me can be visited sooner ."}
{"text":"I keep coming back for the food! Always delicious and the right portion size.  Their problem stems from servers who hate their job or customers in general. The hostess are great but the service is always slow an crappy. Not only do you wait long to seat since it's always crowded but once you do plan for a long wait. It's hot out and you constantly have to flag them for water. They should be on top of that!  Why is it you can get refills on hot coffee but not iced? Esp when it tastes like all they do is pour hot coffee over ice. Sure doesn't taste like cold brew to me very watered down.  Bad service = bad tip Institute team work or have some team pow wow sessions to uplift your servers."}
{"text":"The food at this place is really good.  However, the service is horrible.  I was so excited to eat here with my girls, and was pretty disappointed.  We waited about 15 minutes to put in our drink order, and then didn't get our drinks for over 30 minutes.  We asked the waiter if we could order our food (after about 20 minutes) and he said the bar was backed up (even though a table that sat after us already had theirs).  My friend who was pregnant and about to eat her arm ordered orange juice and when the waiter brought our mimosas, I told him she didn't get her juice and he acted annoyed with me.  I get that everyone has a bad day, but he never apologized for our wait (our food took a while too).  I have told this story to a few other people and they said that's the restaurants MO.  They are known for bad service?  I am usually not one to write bad reviews, but I thought the owners might want to know.   **Side-note: if you order the breakfast burrito, do not order the green sauce unless you like super spicy food!  Might put an asterisk next to this item for spicy.  Just my two cents."}
{"text":"In my top 3 best ever breakfasts! Amazing!  Had the Bella Bella Benny and 3 pancakes: sweet potato, pineapple upside down, and blueberry.  The tangy balsamic dressing and prosciutto were incredible on the Benny.  Hands down best pancakes EVER!  You have to try."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting Snooze and it did not disappoint. The decor is adorable; the manager calls it \"a cross between 'Happy Days' and 'The Jetsons.'\" The service is wonderful and the food is outstanding. We especially appreciated the generous, unexpected portion-size sample of the \"pancake of the day,\" the particular variety of which changes every day, we were told.   Our orders came out quickly and at the right temperature, although we purposely got there early (about 7:45 a.m.), so I don't know if the same applies when they get super-busy, as apparently they always do by 9 a.m. on a weekend day.  I mentioned to the manager, who with genuine interest and friendliness came up to the table to ask how everything was, that the portion size of the pineapple pancakes was enormous. She informed us that almost anything on the menu can be customized at least to some degree. So we could have ordered one pancake instead of two and one that was somewhat smaller in diameter. We will definitely keep that in mind for next time.   I recommend the quinoa porridge. It has currants, cranberries and raisins and is delicious (and is appropriately portioned).   Just a great overall experience. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Well, right from the start, the ONLY reason I did not give Snooze a 5 star rating is because or the wait, which was about 30 minutes longer that the hostess guesstimated.  The two of us sat at the bar for brunch yesterday, Sunday.  The attitudes and people skills of this place is off the chain, some of THE BEST that I have experienced.   So after sitting at the bar for maybe 3 minutes already with coffee in my hand, one of the bar tenders, Andy served the people next to us a cocktail and they RAVED about it, so I asked Andy what it was.  His answer while giving us the extra in the shaker to taste was \" a little morning Margarita.\"  My answer was that it could very easily turn into an all day BIGGGGG Margarita...soooooooooooooo good with the blood orange juice in it, yum!  We each ordered one. So for brunch we decided to get 3 plates and graze; Lynne ordered the pancake sampler, (gluten free), I ordered the corn beef hash with sunny side up and also the OMG stuffed french toast, also gluten free as Lynne does not eat gluten.  I had to taste the OMG stuffed french toast first.  I will admit that I was very unsure of what I was going to taste as most of the time when I do taste gluten free bread, it just does NOT appeal to me.  Let me tell you OMG OMG OMG...it was OMG!!!!  My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it.  I then tried mine, the corn beef hash.  I had it cooked crispy.  It was also off the chain, cooked perrrrrrrrfectly!  Next to get the pleasure of my fork was the pineapple pancake on Lynne's pancake sampler.  I have to say that after tasting all three plates, Snooze had a perfect score that day and we will be back very soon.  BTW, the ambiance was great.  The restaurant has great character and it is great for people watching there.  I want another one of those Margaritas!  Simply deeeeeeeeeeelicious!"}
{"text":"To whomever made my pineapple-upside-down pancakes the other day:  marry me.  Marry me now.  They were delicious ... and I loathe pancakes.  I do.  I ordered them because of a few recommendations from locals about their pancakes.  What is all the fuss about?!  Now I know.  Well done, Snooze; well done."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Snooze in Tempe this was our 3rd experience at Snooze (each in a different location including the original in Denver).  As usual the food was great it's nice to get a breakfast that is high quality, something different and a good value.  the staff was great assuming it was a manager whom greater me but based on his pride and smile you would of thought he was an owner (in a good way) as for our server, Parker, she was friendly and very helpful.  All in all as a restaurant owner myself I'd say this location hit it on the nail.  Will definitely go back (especially in the summer when we can walk right in!)"}
{"text":"The eggs benidict was so delicious. I loved that you could try two different types. The sweet potato pancakes rocked! Great food, great service. The place is super busy. On the weekend be prepared to wait for your table. We had a 45 minute wait. They had complimentary coffee while you wited, a nice perk."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast/brunch place there is! The staff is amazing, the food is outstanding, and the atmosphere is wonderful! I eat here on average of at least once a week, but more often lately. The snooze spuds deluxe are phenomenal! Also request RC as your server! He is attentive, funny, friendly, and just one of the best servers I have ever had! Say hello to Ramon the manager as well!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable atmosphere and our waiter Jason was out of this world. I've never been so impressed with a waiter and the rest of the restaurant. Plus the food is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast. We just went shopping and decried to eat here. A lot of really good sounding options. Their hash brows are really delicious and it's not very expensive.   They also have a lot of breakfast alcoholic drinks which was interesting."}
{"text":"Snooze is great! The wait times can be a little excessive and they've been a little inconsistent at times, but the pancakes more than make up for it."}
{"text":"The breakfast selection was outstanding. We were visiting Arizona and looking for Southwestern breakfast options.. they had many! Everything was delicious.. especially the green chili tortilla base for the Mexican inspired benedicts! Service was great- atmosphere is relaxing and clean. Worth a 30 minute wait on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! A wonderful selection - something for everyone from savory to sweet. Um, pancake flight and choose from the variety of amazing pancakes? Yes please. I had a breakfast sandwich on a pretzel bun, it was delicious. My sister and brother had eggs Benedict (you can choose two different versions if you can't make a choice). We were a bit surprised that the portions of the eggs Benedicts were on the small size, but were surprising filling. Like any breakfast place worth going, there was a wait, but totally worth it. The service was great and everyone was really friendly. Good atmosphere. I didn't try their breakfast cocktails, but they looked amazing! The music was Top 40 which and was a bit loud so that was odd for my Grammy, but it was a pleasant experience. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast. The food isngreat, the staff is great, and the ambiance is very nice. I had the Chiiquiles Benedict which was real good. My dining companion had Jan's Breakfast Tacos and he enjoyed them. One thing to make sure of, if you don't like waiting, is to get here before 8am."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast in old downtown Gilbert which is very cool.. Loved the idea of free coffee while you wait.. Good choices and food great.. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"On a visit to Arizona we stumbled upon this great breakfast joint.  Great Lattes and that says a lot coming from this loyal Starbucks gal.  My husband also raves about the hash and eggs.  Personally I like the yogurt and granola.  It's a great place for breakfast on the patio.  Also has a really cool and different menu of bloody Mary's-didn't try one but they looked good."}
{"text":"We usually always eat breakfast at I hop or first watch, but you get tired of the same locations and want to try new breakfast spots so we tried snooze for the high ratings. We went to Snooze on a busy Sunday morning, with a long waiting time, but overall the service was really great. The quinoa bowl and eggs Benedict were really good. The regular snooze coffee was good too. I had ordered the macchiato previously but wasn't a big fan and the server was kind enough to ask if I had liked it or wanted a regular instead. The server went above and beyond not rushing us and making suggestions she also was trying to put more umbrella on the patio outside for us and other customers. Even with how busy it was they still gave us great service!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in the Phoenix area! You'll have a wait on the weekends but it's totally worth every minute. My favorites are the Juan's Breakfast Tacos with a peanut butter cup pancake but really everything I've had here is amazing. And we saw Michael Phelps here one time!"}
{"text":"Came to Snooze for the first time with my parents while visiting them in Arizona recently and left an extremely happy--albeit sleepy--customer! We played ping pong while we waited for our table to be ready at the suggestion of the hostess and had so much fun! As soon as we sat down our waiter, Michael, came up to us and asked for our drink order. I got the Spicy Bloody with only a slight eye roll from my mother, which was delicious. As newbies to Snooze, we asked Michael for help in deciding what to order and he had great suggestions for us. We could tell he knew the menu backwards and forwards, and he was happy to help us pick out some deliciousness. I ended up getting the Benny duo (one ham, one Bella! Bella!) for myself and the sweet potato pancakes for the table at Michael's suggestion. I don't remember exactly what my parents ordered because I was too excited for my selections, but they enjoyed sharing the sweet potato pancakes with me and what they ordered as well. Great food and even better service ensures that we will be repeat customers especially when I am in town!"}
{"text":"Flip was an incredible server! Had such a great time. Glad to call him my friend. He was very personable, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"So, Snooze, huh? First of all, as much as I love my mornings, I have an equal and dedicated love with the \"snooze\" button. So, immediately, all I can think is \"I can relate...\"!  The atmosphere is absolutely perfect. Adorable and authentic. Diverse and yet coordinated and well put together. The energy is consistent. As in, the host was as personable and upbeat as the server without overdoing it... Because let's be honest here, there's a line between authentic \"radness\" and \"I'm full of shit and trying way too hard to be perky for a good tip\" radness. And let's talk about how great it is, that although there's a wait, you can walk right in to a complimentary cup of their fresh brewed Guatemalan coffee!! Now, I like my coffee untainted by sugars and creamers and the verdict is clear... They clearly drink this stuff in heaven.  Our wait wasn't too painful. A little longer than I necessarily expected, given the size of the crowd. However, it being a new restaurant and such a pleasure to be inside of, the table turnover wasn't as quick as some other places in Phoenix, i.e. \"Matts Big Breakfast\", that keeps you coming back because the food is phenomenal, but is so small that once you're done eating, it's time to dash before you get a rash on your arm from rubbing elbows with the folks at the table next to yours.   Anyway, THE FOOD! Because it's all about the food, right?  Oh. My. God.  I am a true junkie when it comes to French Toast and it's the first thing I try everywhere I go for breakfast, if of course they offer it. Not only does \"Snooze\" offer it, but they offer TWO variations of it, which I'm not sure I have ever seen anywhere else before, aside from your chains like IHOP etc.  The \"OMG French Toast\", stuffed with marscapone and topped with cinnamon, strawberries, vanilla, and... Wait for it... Coconut!.. Which almost threw me off from ordering it, because I'm generally not a fan, but I went for it. And I'm so glad that I did!!!This stuff is appropriately named, because there are TRULY no other words. Absolutely fantastic.!! Now, unfortunately, my 5th star was lost because the food did take a little longer than I think it should ever take for food to come out and it was a little soggy as if it may have been sitting on the line a tad bit longer than it should've been. I'm not going to say it was cold, because it wasn't. However, it wasn't as warm as I would've liked for it to be. Again, all of this is still MINIMAL for a brand new place just getting it's feet on the ground.  Yes, I've applied for a serving position at this spot. But, to be fair, this review isn't ONLY because I'm hoping like hell that they will hire me, but because this is a WONDERFUL addition to Central Phoenix for breakfast and brunch. I will have to check out their lunch menu as well in order to post a review about that aspect, but overall, aside from Matt's which has been in my own humble opinion, the best breakfast ONLY joint in Phoenix for years and Windsor's breakfast/brunch on weekends, Snooze is quickly behind and I have a feeling, is going to DOMINATE the morning scene sooner than later.  Now it's time to head home and snooze... Saturday \"after breakfast naptime\"."}
{"text":"Overpriced/yuppy/hipster/ok food.   Ok, so I guess Yelp did not like the succinct nature of my above review.  Please allow me to add a few pix and a few more words.  Lots of white t-shirts and beards.  Lots of high prices and lots of reviews about coldish food that should be hot (my experience this morning).  The rosemary sausage gravy...it has bits of carrot in it.  Not the first thing I would think to put in gravy.  Not a good choice in my opinion.  I guess I am old and don't have the disposable income I used to have or maybe I would like Snooze better.  I guess I will leave places like this to the 'cool' people of the world.  Congrats to you if you are one of those cool people.  You go and you enjoy your carrot rosemary sausage gravy."}
{"text":"not much to complain about. Go on a bacon day to get extra menu items that will blow your mind."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch recently and was glad that I did. Menu options seemed endless and I was struggling to decide what to order. Luckily my friend ordered the eggs Benedict two ways so I was able to taste test those and was delighted with the corned beef hash I ordered for myself. Fresh ingredients, friendly and attentive service.  Get there early if you're starving. I arrived around 945 AM and waited 15 mins to be seated...not too bad considering the line was out the door by 10 AM."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I gave Snooze a shot this morning. We decided to eat at the bar, which was a great choice because the bartender was insanely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items. My boyfriend ordered the Neat French Toast, which he scarfed down happily. I ordered a soy latte and the Late Harvest Benny. WOW. The benedict was nontraditional with polenta as the base rather than an english muffin. It had creamy hollandaise, swiss chard, goat cheese, and pine nut bread crumbs sprinkled on top. When I gave my boyfriend a bite of it, he thought it was so tasty that he ate half of my meal because he couldn't put his fork down!   It's rare to find a breakfast joint with good food and good service, so we were pleasantly surprised to see top-notch service and delicious food at Snooze.  The most wonderful thing about this restaurant is the QUALITY of the food. All of the meats are free-range, the eggs are cage-free, the coffee is through a partnership, the chai (Bhakti) is from Colorado, and the beers are local craft brews. They even have nontraditional quality liquors, and hot sauce from Colorado, too. Again, it's rare to find a restaurant that cares about the source of its food, so I love that Snooze is eco-friendly and environmentally conscious.  We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the cutest places I've been to for breakfast in a long time! Besides the fact that I have a special place in my heart for local businesses,this place blew me away!! I went around 9 AM with a friend on a Tuesday morning and was quickly seated out front on the patio. The view is beautiful and the staff is lovely. Although I can't remember exactly what I ordered from the menu, I remember that it was absolutely wonderful. An added bonus was that they're dog friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place.  I love breakfast and they do a very good breakfast.  It is a bit on the expensive side for a breakfast place.  Sometimes I miss having Jam's next to campus.  The chocolate pancakes are decent but if you really want something different opt for a barbacoa omelet."}
{"text":"Did finally give it another try.  Waited 30 minutes.  The food was good but super loud.  Waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Great place to meet up with friends for something quick and unique dishes.  Came here on a whim for breakfast and was impressed. If you like eggs benedict order the Benny Duo because you get to choose two different styles, Perfect for someone who can't decide which ones to pick."}
{"text":"Hate the wait, but loved the food.  I was willing to over look the wait until I realized I was overcharged. I called to have this resolved and was informed it will be looked at after closing and a picture of the transaction will be sent to me. I didn't request a picture, I want the additional funds stolen to be returned. We live in a digital world with such advanced technology, overcharging shouldn't be an issue. Yes! I said stolen! You don't take more than what was provided. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my food and tribe atmosphere was great. I got the Italian and Mexican eggs Benedict I don't remember what they were called). The Italian one was so amazing, you won't regret it. The Mexican one, meh. I got a mountain mule as well and it was fantastic and comes highly recommended by our table. He cinnamon pancake was so good and decadent, get one to share. The prices were normal. So considering all factors this place gets a B+. It may not become your favorite place, but you'll be happy to come."}
{"text":"Wow! All I can really say is wow! Incredible food! Honestly the best breakfast I have had in the whole state of Arizona! That is how impressed we are! Best Bloody Mary's in the state as well! Incredible impressive! We recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great management and delicious food!  My favorite dish on the menu is the spuds and flight of pancakes!  Lattes are delicious as well! They rock!"}
{"text":"My husband went in for breakfast on a Tuesday morning at approximately 7am.  We normally visit the Tempe location but, decided to give this location a try. We were greeted and seated by the host and ignored for at least five minutes; I finally stood up from my seat I thought maybe they can't see us.  After being noticed, we placed our coffee order only to get a bitter tasting coffee.  I pushed it to the edge of the table hoping someone would notice, clearly by now they had to know we were there.  It just sat there for another 3 minutes.  Finally the waitress comes by and I told her something was wrong with my coffee; It had left a bitter taste in my mouth.  In the meantime, the restaurant manager, who resembles grumpy cat walks around greeting everyone else but, us. I have never felt so unwelcome at a restaurant before.  I will never visit this place again.  Word of advise, if someone is going to to spend 40+ and tip 10+ each visit, at least make them feel welcome. Tempe location rocks!  This place not!"}
{"text":"Snooze is great! By far my favorite breakfast place. Today I got Miranda as my server and she was awesome! She had some great recommendations and was friendly and efficient, she really made the experience great!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place but unfortunately I have more negative things to say than positive. Pros: The food. We had the breakfast pot pie which was delicious! It only comes with 1 egg on top so I ordered a second egg for $2. The pancake trio(upside down pineapple, blueberry and strawberry)They were all very tasty but also very sweet. We also ordered the Benny Benedict which was delicious. They have a nice size menu with lots of options..I think they had 7 types of eggs benedict? We ordered family style to share between 3 of us. The hash browns were fantastic!!  Cons: -There's no place to sit/wait for your table. We were awkwardly standing in the way of people coming in and out. They have a bar area but it was busy and didn't have many seats. -They ask for your phone # to text you when your table is ready...I really didn't care to have to check my phone every few minutes to see if our table was ready. -Bathroom...very small, 2 stalls and the hand dryer is right in front of the stall so you can see someone drying their hands while you're using the restroom. -Worst part...the service!! Michael was our server and he couldn't have cared less. He was busy but a smile wouldn't have killed him. He was very cold and seemed like he was in a hurry to leave or had something else on his mind. We had to flag him down for refills/water. Someone else brought our food out, the pancakes came first....then we waited and waited for the rest of our food. He never checked on us or asked how our food was. We waited for quite a while for him to pick up our check while watching him do his side work.  Overall the food was delicious but service was all over the place. We went on Saturday around 1:30."}
{"text":"Great place to try!  They have an amazing amount of Gluten free choices.  The staff is so friendly and fun!  It's decorated retro and very different.  Great food and a fun experience!"}
{"text":"Great food when I've been here in the past but their service has done nothing but gone downhill with an influx of customers. After being told we would have a 30 minute wait, we finally were sat after over an hour with no apology, then no waiter or waitress came to our table for fifteen minutes so we left. Bummed too because the food really is good!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place STARTS off with FREE coffee while you wait for your table!  Once we sat down, the staff was great!!  The menu has more than enough interesting options!  (not just the usual stuff).  I had the  French Toast and my girl friends had the Breakfast pot pie.  Both were delicious!  The music was great! Our waitress was Julia, I believe, she was wonderful but if you needed something, like ICE, the others jumped right in.  I say ICE because, while it was pretty sitting outside, even under an umbrella, it was HOT!  It's AZ in June, needed ice to cool off our skin...OUT DOOR MISTERS, FANS WOULD REALLY HELP!!  Postinos next door has them. They make a BIG difference in enjoying your meal.  Corp. in Colorado says its not policy or necessary.  IT'S AZ ! BETW MAY - SEPT. , ITS NECESSARY!!  Let Corp. know that it makes a big difference!  I will definitely go back, I'm hoping I don't have to wait until Oct to do so. Renee McCray,  Gilbert, AZ"}
{"text":"What a great find in my neighborhood of central Phoenix!  The food is delicious and beautifully presented.  The place is new, aesthetically pleasing and staffed by well-trained people who are pleasant, attentive and friendly.  The trendy decor, however, has nothing to absorb the noise so with the music a bit too loud, the voices are elevated as well and the overall noise level is just too much.  If the food wasn't exceptional, I would write this one off my list.  Maybe a weekday would be better if there are fewer diners!"}
{"text":"The Best pancakes I have ever eaten! I ordered the pancake flight breakfast,  and choose the pineapple upside down, the pancake of the day, and the sweet potato, I also had a piece of bacon.  Each bite was an explosion of flavorful goodness. The price was decent and reasonable for the quality and flavor. The atmosphere was very retro but comfy and easy going. I will defintely go back."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast yesterday. It was a long wait but they have a full bar, free coffee and plenty of seats for waiting. I had Mmm..Mmm mimosa and my boyfriend had the spicy Bloody Mary. I had the scramble bacon and barbacoa and it was delicious. The other 3 people I was with had Juan's tacos, Bella Bella Benny and the chilaquies (spelling?) Benny. It was excellent and I would go back again."}
{"text":"incredibly long wait, but would possibly return for another bloody mary."}
{"text":"Honestly the best breakfast tacos I've ever had! Pico was so so delicious. My home made ones will forever be a let down from now on, and that's not the Orange Snoozius talking. Every dish that I saw looked amazing, and I wish I could have tried them all. If I ever get the chance to go again I will try something else even though I know I loved the corn tortilla tacos.  The atmosphere was up beat, trendy, and loud. Not too loud. Just perfect so that you could have a normal conversation without being overheard. I hate it when it's too quiet and you have to whisper to avoid the odd looks about our bizarre conversations."}
{"text":"Sadly I'm giving them a 1 star because I sat there for 10 minutes (while writing this review) before walking out! I realize it was later in the afternoon but to be completely ignored for that long (when the restaurant isn't even busy) is ridiculous!   I love this place back home in CO so when I saw that we had one in PHX I was ecstatic!   I hope they don't treat all their \"lunch\" hour guests that way!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to snooze a bunch of times because, well, because some friends of mine love it. Because it's in the neighborhood. And because Tempe is desperately short on great breakfast options.   I know people love snooze, I know, but I just can't get past a few things:  1. The hash browns. They are not crispy. Ever. Actually they are totally bland.   2. While the egg benedict options are good, most of them leave me feeling really heavy after breakfast. This stands to reason to an extent, but I've had Benedicts that are not this way.   3. There is an absence of anything really great. Almost everything on the menu I have ordered (all of the Benedicts, sausage, pancakes, French toast, bacon) are ok or good. But not great."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The details in the decor are bright and energizing (perfect for morning time) and the food is awesome!! Our server Andrea was super sweet and even gave us a complimentary appetizer since it was our first time here! I'd definitely come back if I lived out here!!!"}
{"text":"I don't have much to say about this place other than disappointed! Waited an hour an a half for food that wasn't that good! I did the duo Benny's and it's was so salty I could even eat it!! I will never wait that long for food from here again! I should have gone to the whiskey bar across the street!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Friday, no waiting, this place is so nice and staffs are all friendly. Food was Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Great college atmosphere, super friendly staff, great selection. I had the pretzel bun sandwich thingy, with the hollandaise sauce. Perfection."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food at all. I've had better breakfasts at other places. It was just okay. Not Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix by a long shot. Beautiful restaurant but the hype didn't match the quality."}
{"text":"Delicious food.Great service. Excellent music playing in background.  We tried 3 different benedicts, all were perfection. Pancakes are rich and sweet...perfect for sharing one order among a table. Eclectic morning drinks helped start our vacation in style.  Server Olivia is 5 star....Attentive,  genuine, and great smile which she generously shares."}
{"text":"The wait was ridiculous we waited 40 minutes to be seated. After we had a table I had to grab a server after waiting 20 minutes with nobody acknowledging us. The food was just okay definitely didn't live up to the hype. I don't think we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Order a scramble with soyrizo, mushrooms and bell peppers with some hashbrowns and toast. The only good thing on the plate was the wheat toast. Scramble was wet and bland. Hashbrowns were a disgrace to hashbrowns all over the world. We also bought the upside down pancakes which were tasty except for the fact they were raw batter in the middle of the pancake. Pancake fail  overall, disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"I'll give Snooze 3.5 stars, the food is good, the service was good, the ambiance was GREAT. Would recommend and go again if I came back to Phx."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Service is excellent. I would eat here again. Mike had the blueberry Danish pancakes very large serving tastes like a blueberry Danish. I had the green eggs and ham sandwich very good, eggs and spinach Swiss cheese ham on a fresh but chewy bun yum. The volume is loud with everyone talking it's not a quiet place but there is a quiet patio. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Absolute BEST breakfast I've ever gone out to have. The coffee \"donut\" pancake was to die for as was the Lower East Sider and breakfast burrito. Everything on the menu looks so amazing, it's hard to choose. PLUS, the wait staff is super friendly and helpful. The wait was long, but totally worth it. I already have my next trip planned!"}
{"text":"They only offer two types of beer which is disappointing if you don't like breakfast type alcoholic beverages. I had French Toast Neat, which was disappointing, with a side of two scrambled eggs, which seemed like one in serving size, and it was all very overpriced. I won't be coming back. Perhaps I will try Postino next door for brunch next time."}
{"text":"This place is really good. At times there can be a long wait and the restaurant can be somewhat noisy, but the food is fantastic. If you like pancakes, they are really good and they have some pretty crazy pancake flavors."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food, atmosphere and customer service!!!!!! The host, wait staff, bartenders are all so fantastic! We went two days in a row it was so good!!!!!! Can't wait to go again!!!!"}
{"text":"Snooze is a lovely restaurant for breakfast and brunch. A little more expensive then I like on a weekly basis, but once every few months is a real treat. Good food, massive portions, yummy drinks. There's sometimes a wait, but the shopping plaza is lovely and they will text you when the table is ready. There's lots of pokestops and you can reach a gym from inside."}
{"text":"Great breakfast menu, awesome location. Ordered  3 egg omelet with three fillings. Their cop of coffee is like a small vase, you probably won't ask for a refill."}
{"text":"Unimpressed with them. Everything on the menu was the same thing. I know it's a breakfast eatery but there was no variety in what they offered for breakfast. All their items had the exact same style egg offered. The sandwich I ended up going with was uneventful."}
{"text":"Amazing food that is produced by combining a myriad of different local vendors ingredients! You might think with that in mind you will have to pay with an arm and a leg, but that is not necessarily the case. A full Rueben sandwich is basically $10, and it's fantastic!   Additionally the customer service is outstanding. Angela, our waitress, was amazing and very upbeat. She even gave us a free dish of their secret pancakes!  Definitely a place to try at least once! You will not be disappointed... seriously try it."}
{"text":"They have free coffee while you wait for a table. Enough said.  The costumer service here is great. Even though its crowded on weekends, they are really accomodating.  Delicious food. The bacon is weirdly amazing.  Always have a great experience here!"}
{"text":"I had a very disappointing experience all around. This was my first time at this location, and I have no plans to return. My husband and I split the pancake flight and each got our own egg dish. The pancakes came out cold, but were very tasty. My egg white omelet was inedible, as it was swimming in cooking oil. There was a puddle of it on the plate, and when I tried to wipe that it just kept pouring out. I've never sent a plate of food back for something like that, but it was so gross. I told my server and got a new one about 10-15 minutes later, when my husband and was almost finished eating.   When the check came, they had tried to charge me for both omelets. No manager came to apologize, no comped coffee, nothing. They did do the courtesy of only making me pay for the one omelet though.  Overall, like I said, super disappointing experience. Go to the location in Scottsdale or central Phoenix if you're looking to try this."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  friendly fun staff and amazing food ! I love all the food here but my favorite would have to be the verde Benny and Santa fee benny. You can mix and match the benidicts which is awesome for someone who wants both or can't make up their mind.   :) you will wait a while but it is totally worth It, they text you when the table is ready so you can go shop or walk around and best part  there's a coffee bar available while waiting. :)"}
{"text":"Again. Not impressed.  Why am I brought back to places I don't like! Another friend wanted to have bkfast here.    Cold tacos, bland flavorless, pancakes are heavy and too sweet.   Service felt like it was our bartenders first real job :) had to ask for silverware, more coffee, more water, condiments etc.    I'll try not to come back...  just another chain."}
{"text":"Coolest public nursing experience yet....  After a really hectic day, we ended up at Snooze eatery in Gilbert. Lunch was wonderful with the first waitress sending us a complimentary pancake to welcome us.  As we were finishing up, my baby needed to nurse and I nursed without my cover like I usually do, not paying attention to anyone around me except my latte and family at the table.    Out of nowhere another waitress stops by our table with ANOTHER awesome complimentary peach cobbler pancake with rasperries and streusel for us with a note tucked in.  She walked away before I got to read it and it said ,  \"thank you so much for breastfeeding here! , Erica.\"    She absolutely made my year and I was so touched by it.  Thankful for people like Erica and the support of nursing without shame at awesome places like Snooze.  AZ mamas, this is a place I love to support simply because of how awesome they treat their patrons!  They have won me over!!   PS - I haven't had a meal I didn't love here,  the Eggs over Sammy, lattes, and cinnamon roll pancake were delicious.   Their atmosphere is bright, fun and inviting.    The staff is ridiculously nice and welcoming.   Their lawn games are a perfect way for kids to spend some energy outside.     They didn't rush us out when we were the last people finishing up.  Thank you Snooze and Erica for an amazing visit!!"}
{"text":"The food was incredibly delicious, but the noise level made the overall experience pretty unnerving.  I certainly understand some level of ambiance; being in my 20's, I have no problem frequenting loud clubs and bars. I just wasn't expecting to have to yell my order at the server who had to lean in to hear me. (The server's attention and attitude was fine.)  Reign the music back a tad and invest in some sound dampening panels or area rugs and I'd totally be back. Otherwise, probably not.  But. Well. You know. That's just like. My opinion man."}
{"text":"I love this place! There's usually quite a wait for breakfast, but there's plenty of shopping to do next door. And the wait is completely worth it: I get the 3 egg breakfast every time and is always so delicious! My favorite breakfast place :)"}
{"text":"Hands down best breakfast I've had in AZ. A little pricey but so worth it for elevated breakfast cuisine. I had the Benny duo and my boyfriend had a special. Both were amazing. Service at the bar was fun. We'll skip this place on the weekends because it's chaotic but 8am on a Monday was perfect. It was getting busy and there was a wait by the time we left."}
{"text":"We have been to the Snooze in Austin, Texas. This location in Phoenix  doesn't disappoint. Everything was excellent. Frittata was delicious, the breakfast tacos were also delicious and the potion was HUGE! We also got a blueberry pancake and it was really worth the extra calories too. The ambiance is great. We sat outside with music and a nice breeze. It's breakfast food with a twist. You won't be sorry you came!"}
{"text":"I give the cooks 5 stars for the amazing food.  I am sorry that I had to drop an overall rating because of the mismanaging of table flow.  Over an hour wait, when initially told 30 minutes is a lil off. The free drinks were a nice compensation, but really over an hour???"}
{"text":"Food  was fantastic, light and fresh. The gluten free pancakes are so tasty. Olivia was our server and made great recommendations. The atmosphere was relaxing and comfortable, we didn't even mind waiting. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Really great mimosas, blueberry danish pancakes, and chocolate chip pancakes! Service was good but not amazing. Would come back though!"}
{"text":"Bad service! My boy's iced teas were empty for nearly 10 min. Then waitress was nowhere to be flagged down. When our breakfast was served, we asked for a refill. I watched the waitress, Jessica, chat with her coworkers and take her time. Finally she came over with a pitcher, reached across my plate with her elbow in my face! Twice! My chilaquiles were good, but my boys hated the too sweet $3.75 side of bacon. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome service, I've never waited too long even when they had a full house. Delicious breakfast burritos. I haven't been disappointed yet. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the pineapple upside down pancakes-perfecto! They were recommended and were all that.  The fact that you can have a flight with choice of pancakes and even have French toast with it sets Snooze apart from any other breakfast place I've been to....and I've been to a few!   Unique decor gives the interior character.  Looking forward to my next visit! Will definitely try the coffee."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. Food was great, but that quickly did not matter while we were there. We ate at the bar, for it was super busy and packed. I finished my coke within the first 10 minutes of getting it, way before I got my food, and never got a refill even when I asked for one. They looked annoyed when we told them we needed a few more minutes to decide what to order. One of them even rolled her eyes. May not seem like a big deal, but they are in a customer service business. Honestly, we probably won't ever go back to this location. We might try the other ones but definitely not this one!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE coming here for brunch! Although the wait tends to be quite excessive, I usually can grab a single seat at the bar within minutes of my arrival. When there are 2-3 of us, we are usually seated at the bar within 15 mins upon arrival (Tip: ALWAYS ALWAYS head for the bar.) I've frequented this location over a dozen times and have yet to sit at an actual table (I've lost my appetite after 45 mins and, once it hits an hour I've gone from hungry to borderline postal...no thanks).  Service (5 stars all the way): Not one time have I come here and not been greeted with a warm smile and friendly face. The bartenders are the best servers (since that's all I've experienced). Being a regular helps, they always know what drink I want before I order...makes my life so much easier. It seems that they get tastier and tastier with each visit. Try the Mmm Mmm Mimosa.  Food (5 stars): Some of the food items tend to rotate with the season. If you have an opportunity, try the Sweet Potato Pancakes. Man! They're so good. I typically get The Snooze Classic (3 cage free eggs cooked anyway you like, hash browns, choice of meat and toast), which I sub the meat for avocado and the toast for a pancake for a small up charge (sweet potato of course)!  If you love Eggs Benedict, they have quite the selection. And these are NOT your obvious selections either. You have the option of mix and matching those bad boys for an optimal experience. I opt for either the Benny Goodman (Lox style salmon and cream cheese, poached cage free eggs, cream cheese hollandaise blended with sun dried tomato and caper relish on sourdough) or the Bella! Bella! Benny (Thin slices of prosciutto, Taleggio cheese, perfectly poached eggs on toasted ciabatta, topped with cream cheese hollandaise, balsamic glaze and arugula). I'm certain at some point I will try other menu options however, for right now, I'm sticking to the items that pacify my cravings for good food!  Atmosphere (4 stars): I've visited 3 of their 4 valley locations. Gilbert has been my place of choice (perhaps they make the best drinks..or maybe its because I'm a creature of habit..who knows...LOL). Tempe is ALWAYS crowded due to the location near the college. It may also be the fact that another awesome restaurant shares the sidewalk and entrance with Snooze so, folks probably toggle back and forth. They could use additional seating for those waiting. The Phoenix location is in a prime area (Biltmore-Camelback). I've only visited there once but, the crowds are not as popular as the other locations I've frequented (maybe folks in the area haven't caught on to the Snooze concept. LOL). The decor almost reminds me of the 50's.   Snooze is a definite must if you haven't tried them yet. Expect a wait on the weekends. It's worth it if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Was disappointed.  The wait is \"Long\"..not enough room inside for people waiting so the stand around and too close to those who are already eating at tables. The food is \"just Ok'. My eggs were slightly runny and the hash brown potatoes were not  very good  The bacon is excellent.  Will not be returning to this eatery."}
{"text":"Always a great experience - food and service. The pancake flight is a must! Out of town guests are always delighted. Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Although the place is trendy and well designed, Snooze is very hit or miss. The first time I went I ordered the OMG french toast and was very underwhelmed. The sauce was off and the rest of the ingredients did not seem fresh, however since then I have tried the bella bella benny and the sweet potato pancakes and they were both pretty good. That being said the food is still quite overpriced and the wait is often long."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to attend the soft opening at snooze this morning. I'm impressed, to say the least!  The food is delicious, great atmosphere, super friendly staff and I love the energy. My sister and I ordered a pancake flight (pineapple upside down, blueberry and strawberry shortcake). They were all amazing. We also ordered a duo Benedict (caprese and chilaquiles) as well as a breakfast pot pie (can't remember the exact name). Our server, Dylan, was informative, friendly, accommodating and fun. I can't complain about anything. Whoever said \"you snooze, you lose,\" has never been to the Snooze eatery. (Cheesy, I know). I can't wait to return! :)"}
{"text":"Only come here when you are not starving and don't mind the long wait.  From the time we arrived to getting our food, it was over an hour wait.  20 mins wait for a table for two on Saturday morning. 15 mins just to get a latte and our order taken.  Then 40 mins for our food to come out.  The food was okay.  Our waitress gave us the bill when our plate was still half full.  After all the waiting, I'm being rushed to leave?  The customer to our right keeps raving about how awesome this place is, when another lady next table over was complaining about the long wait too.  We've been here several times and the experience has been the same each time.  I can't agree with the raves and hype of this place."}
{"text":"Nice people. Good food.  Long wait of 45 minutes this morning at 930am. Lots of people left and they had three empty tables virtually all morning. A bit understaffed based on demand. Hash Bowne a bit undercooked for all of us. Better than good egg"}
{"text":"Kate was super nice and gave us a free pineapple upside down pancake and was so friendly and always happy"}
{"text":"As a few other reviewers have noted, this place is extremely overhyped.  I was super excited to try it and was disappointed both with the food and the service. They told us the wait would be 30 minutes, we waited over double this. It took over an hour. The thing that particularly frustrated me is that toward the end of my wait, I watched two people just waltz in in front of us. Apparently they had some open bar seating available that was first come first serve, and no one mentioned to us that this was an option.  By the time I got to my seat I was a little annoyed, but the menu looked good and after the wait I really wanted to enjoy myself. The server took our order, and literally never came back. Someone else brought out the food, and we practically had to beg the guy to take our money since he had evidently forgot we were there.  To add fuel to the fire, neither of our meals were good. I wouldn't say it was awful, but it definitely wasn't anything worth going back for. The food was plain and cooked poorly. I was really disappointed in the entire experience and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Solid food, decent wait staff, would def go again.  My omelet was very good, but would go with the breakfast burrito next time!"}
{"text":"I don't even like pancakes. The only time I ever have them is if people say, \"you have to try these\". The best pancakes I have ever had is Boots and Kimos in hawaii. These pineapple pancakes are ridiculously good. I think we have a tie. The place is clean and swanky. No doubt, this place is a keeper."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place!!! I am new to the area and have had a really hard time finding a quality breakfast place that is also fun and somewhere I would actually want to hang out and take friends. I FOUND IT! Not only was the food awesome (huge portions by the way) but my server Jessica was AMAZING! She was so much fun, had some great menu recommendations (the pineapple upside down pancake...OH...MY...GOD) and answered all my questions with a smile or joke, I loved it! She even went out of her way to give me some recommendations on things to do around the area with my kiddos since we're new here, I cannot thank her enough! I will most definitely be back to try a few other things and will also be sure to ask for Jessica's section!"}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey but good.n Substantial servings!  Coffee can be inconsistent but servers are great & helpful.  Can be noisy but breakfast on the patio this month would be amazing!  A manager who cares about her store, too.  Considerable wait on weekends...."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we were told it would be a 40 minute wait. When 45 minutes passed we were told it would be an additional 30 minutes!  There were about 7-9 open tables, plenty of outdoor seating and immediate counter space available for 2 people. The staff was extremely rude when I questioned the reason for the long wait time.   I will never go there again!  I would not recommend this place to anyone. Don't waste your time or money. There are plenty of other businesses who know how to accommodate people on a Sunday."}
{"text":"It was really good except the strawberries that came with my Omg! Frenchtoast tasted like meat was on them (probably cut with the same knife they use for meat). Other than that it was good service and my friend was completely satisfied with his pear pancakes we both couldn't finish and came in starving."}
{"text":"Cute, 50's-esqe (as currently manufactured in China) mid-century modern space. Interesting and inventive pancakes. Pineapple upside down cake was excellent, sweet potato didn't quite work.  Not too pricey for a breakfast place.  Will try again."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast this morning. Very efficient waiting process and notification when table was available. Breakfast, however was less than expected. Two of us had the mimosa with grapefruit juice and St. Germain and found the drink to be very bitter. Expected the St. Germain to smooth the flavors, but not even a hint of the liquor. Given the strong bitter flavor, could be the St. Germain didn't make it into the drink. My daughter was served the wrong omelet, my fried eggs were to be over easy, but were hard rocks. Service was okay, though we had to ask a couple of times for our server. Overall, not a good introduction to the chain and will hesitate before going to any other location."}
{"text":"So incredibly delish!  Went here on a Saturday with two friends - totally excited for the possibilities of good breakfast!  They had both been to a Snooze before in CO so had talked up the food greatly before we headed out.  I always worry that I'm being oversold and it won't live up to the hype - I was wrong!  Everything was fabulous.  The d√©cor is super cute here - I love anything with a vintage, retro vibe.  Cool colors and the jacks on the wall and the booths.  I liked the outdoor seating and the windows that are always open.    The food - one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  We three decided to split a few different plates: flight of pancakes, eggs benedict, and breakfast sandwich.  The flight of pancakes is a great idea and perfect for sharing.  We had three different flavors: pineapple upside down, flavor of the day (lemon & blueberry w/oats), and a chocolate decadent masterpiece.  I loved them all equally.  So now I'm left to dream of more visits to Snooze and what fabulous breakfast to try next.  I think I know what I'm doing on Saturday!"}
{"text":"Great place tucked away in the town and country shopping plaza in Camelback and 20th St. Food was so good sand service was excellent, started with an awesome iced chai, though I really wanted to try one of their bloody Mary's...I'll save that fire my next visit. Had the Ham Benedict III...so good my egg poached to perfection. I will definitely be returning back here soon, probably for Sunday brunch so I can give that bloody Mary a try. If you're in the area definitely stop in and have a great meal."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. They were more then willing to make accommodations for kids with special needs. I highly recommend this spot for brunch!"}
{"text":"When entering, the restaurant looks great. Love the Mod decor and upbeat music. We happened to go in the morning on a cooler day and they had the windows and doors open, so the place was downright chilly. We asked to be moved closer to the kitchen. The menu is great and there are plenty of unique items to choose from in addition to \"regular\" options. The food took a little while to arrive, but looked great when it did. I ordered the pea polenta cakes with hollandaise and my son ordered the french toast off the kids menu. Both of our orders tasted good, but were served luke-warm. The hashbrowns were not crispy and were served as if they had been popped out of muffin cups. Flavor good, temperature of food-not. I would have sent the food back, but it took a while to receive it and our waitress did not check in with us right away. While somewhat disappointing, I would go back, or maybe to a different Snooze."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried snooze for the first time this morning. To our relief we were sat immediately (I read other reviews before going and was expecting at least an hour wait). Good start to the morning. Our waitress was very friendly and very attentive and explained the menu since we said it was our first time attending the restaurant. Once we ordered, the food was out surprisingly fast for how busy it was.  Now, I would have given this 5 stars if it were based solely on atmosphere and wait service, but... The food was nothing that I was impressed with. Even the opposite. My husband ordered the omg French toast and a side of bacon (which he enjoyed). I ordered the basic eggs, hash browns, toast and bacon. My eggs that were poached tasted as if I was dipping them vinegar. Wasn't sure if this was just how it was or not, but not my liking. (Side note: was told later that it was used to keep the shape, but I would rather flat eggs that taste delicious than the vinegar drenched flavor I had) Anyways, the toast with jelly was great. Then my bacon was super sweet which I thought was weird (hoping for a salty relief from the sweetness of the jelly, but found none there). My husband even said his tasted different and not as sweet as mine which I would have loved (no chance to try his as he ate them very quickly).  Overall, coffee was good and service was great, but I left feeling unsatisfied. I would like to give it another try maybe someday, but it will be far down the list of breakfast choices for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfasts. Highly recommend the Snooze Spuds Deluxe - cheesy hash browns with a choice of two fillings - or the delicious Corned Beef Hash. The pancakes are out of this world! Sweet Potato is my favorite - the pancakes are topped with homemade caramel, candied pecans and ginger butter.  For the pancake-indecisive, the menu offers a flight of three flavors.  Be prepared for a long wait on weekends...the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"My first visit was about 3 weeks ago, and I came in when they opened at 6:30 am. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. My boyfriend and I ordered our food and it came out surprisingly fast, which was a plus. My order was incorrect, but the waitress (can't remember her name) noticed right away that something wasn't right, and she took it back to the kitchen to have it remade. The food was excellent and so was our waitress! She definitely was on top of things and deserves 5 stars.   My boyfriend and I were so pleased with our first visit, that we were back a week later. Unfortunately, it went downhill fast. Again, we arrived on a weekday at 6:30 am, right when they opened. We had the place to ourselves, and it took about 10 minutes just for our waitress to come over and ask what we would like to drink. We had a different waitress this visit, which kind of bummed me out because the girl from last time was very nice! But I thought this waitress would be just as nice. WRONG. After 10 minutes she finally came around and got our drinks and took our order. I reminded her that I wanted my eggs over hard, because I don't like the runny yolk. She acknowledged that and put our order in. It took about 30 minutes for our food to come out. Which I don't completely understand, considering we were the only people in the place. But it wasn't a big deal, since we were in no rush. Finally our food comes to the table, and again, they screwed up the eggs. I mentioned it to our waitress and her reply just stunned me. She had the worst attitude and said \"I asked you if you wanted your eggs over hard.\" To which I replied \"Yes, exactly. These eggs are not over hard.\" And she grabbed the plate and said \"Okay\" with a snarky tone, and walked away. I also got a side of bacon with my order, so I was munching on that while my food was being remade. As I picked up the second piece of bacon, I noticed there were 2 pieces of black HAIR cooked IN the bacon! Gross! And when I was putting it back down on the plate, I noticed another small black hair on the plate! When the waitress came back over to us, I pointed it out to her and she offered a new plate of bacon but I was too disgusted so I said forget it. When my food came back out, it was not hot. It was like it was sitting there for 10 minutes waiting to be taken out of the kitchen. Our visit today was a hard miss, and I understand things happen, but our waitress was beyond rude and made the whole visit uncomfortable. I can't remember her name, but she had long wavy blonde hair. The manager came over to us and gave us a card for free pancakes on our next visit, due to the horrible visit we had. Honestly, that's probably the only reason I'll be back. After that, I think I'll take my business elsewhere to a place who takes pride in customer service and excellent food."}
{"text":"I am so glad I read my email, saw this place and checked it out on here. I went on a Saturday morning around 9am and it was so packed! If you go by the bar, they give you whatever bevy you need so your wait isn't awful. They give you coffee in handle-less mugs and not disposable cups so you know that they care if you stay and not just leave. Also, they send you a text when your table is almost ready so you can roam around while you wait. And let me tell you, it is worth the wait. When you are seated, all the staff great you as they see you and the customer service is great! The menu may not look like a lot of options but when you read them, you want to try them all!! Fortunately, you can do some mix and matching so you can try a few dishes at one. For instance, if you like 2 of their eggs benedicts, you can get one of each! They have the pancake flight where you can have 3 different delicious pancakes on one plate. Speaking of which, we ordered the pancake flight that had pineapple upside down, caramel apple and sweet potato. Listen...I don't even like pancakes like that but these...these were f-ing delicious!!! They were light, not overly sweet and not too many overspend to over power the dish. Also, I'm not a big sweet potato/sweet potato pie fan but I'd those sweet potato pancakes all day; they were that good! We also got (we split the dishes so we can taste everything lol) the 3 egg omelette with chorizo, caramelized onions and jack cheese which came with a little tower of seasoned hash browns. Those eggs were fluffy and delicious; not runny at all or slightly browned, just perfect. We also topped it off nicely with the Mmm Mmm Mimosa; tasty and gets you toasty! Like I said, so glad I went. Our server Bianca was awesome and I'll definitely promote this place!"}
{"text":"I want to give a 2 star review but because of the gluten free options that are available you get another star.   Review: We called in to place an order for pick-up take-out for 2 meals and were told it would be ready in 20minute.. When we get there in 20 minutes, the waitress tells us that they have no record of the order and that they will put it in right now and it will take 5-10 minutes....WE'RE HANGRY!! It took them 25minutes to get the food out to us. The manager did make up for it by offering 50% off our bill (which also makes me want to give you 3 stars instead of 2). Being allergic to gluten, I have to put up with this type of service because not many places offer yummy gluten free options like they do. The gluten free pancakes were worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch spot.  Great service.  Food is fresh.  Coffee is good.  I got and enjoyed the Snooze Classic, but it appears the pancakes are super good as well.  Great area out back with greenery, corn hole, ping pong table.  Great spot!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with the food and service the first time I came to Snooze. I was excited to bring my family back while they were in town visiting for Thanksgiving. Our experience was quite different than the first time I had been there. We waited FOREVER for our meals to come out and when they did they were cold. We were disappointed because the flavor of everything was great. We had mentioned this to our waitress and she said she would let her manager know. Just a a couple of minutes later the manager came over and said that our meal was on him. We were so impressed by the customer service. He was gracious and grateful we had come in. I will definitely be back because they know how to take care of their customers. Thanks Snoozers!"}
{"text":"yes! this place is incredible! great prices, excellent food and awesome service! can't say enough good things about snooze! bear down!"}
{"text":"Just left...first timers. Where do I start? I must say I liked the decor and music. The servers seemed attentive except for ours. I ordered the three egg plate with my eggs over-medium because I hate runny whites. Guess what? Eggs came barely over easy. This plate was suppose to come with toast! Didn't get any to wipe up my runny egg whites. To top off the experience, a different server grabbed our salt and pepper shakers to do his side work and touched my straw with his hand as he put them back. Not sure why it's become acceptable for servers to be pulling items off our table when I'm trying to enjoy my meal but I find it rude. Might try the one in Tempe but more than likely sticking with Matt's Big Breakfast!"}
{"text":"Snooze is an apt name for this. Underwhelmed to say the least. My food was cold, as was my boyfriend's. When I brought this to the server's attention, she attempted to suggest my food was cold due to the hollandaise sauce on my poached eggs, explaining  the sauce should be cold. Nice try but the entire plate of food was cold. And in terms of flavor and distinction, everything was bland. Though my food was replaced with warmer food, no one bothered to deduct the cost. It seems the restaurant spends a lot of energy on appearance and marketing but more energy needs to be spent on timely delivery of warm food that lives up to the hype--particularly when a breakfast tab runs nearly $50 for two people. And the noise is this place is deafening!! Forget about having a conversation. Horrible acoustics made worse by music that is set on the loudest level, to, apparently, cover up the noise of the crowd. Wouldn't return. Go to Matt's Big Breakfast instead."}
{"text":"This was my second time to Snooze and this time I remembered to snap a quick pic before devouring my amazing breakfast!   Snooze is a hot spot for breakfast and will get very crowded on the weekends especially since it is located on ASU campus. You will see your fair share of sorority girls and frat bros but don't let that deter you from enjoying the creative breakfast selections. I went for the vegetarian friendly Eggs Benedict and was very pleased. They serve their hash browns made into a small cone with good flavor but I do prefer mine slightly crispier. The eggs are cooked to perfection and are served on top of a wide range of fun selections. They also have some tasty sounding sandwiches and plates that I have yet to try.   The service is decent but you can tell they are trying to move you through as quickly as possible. They clear your table before you're really done eating and bring the check when you're only half way through your meal. This doesn't bother me too much since I'd rather not wait forever to get my check, but I don't like feeling rushed either. Despite the long waits and mediocre service Snooze is totally worth it because they are friendly and most important the food is fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great food, cool place, the benedict choices were great.  Would recommend to anyone who is a breakfast lover."}
{"text":"First review I have done and Snooze deserves it.   ONE WORD - BACON!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My sister first introduced me to Snooze in San Diego. I immediately was a fan and try to hit it on every trip. Of course was super excited when I realized they were building one in AZ.    I have only been to this location once since it is not in my neck of the woods. Went on a Monday morning on a holiday weekend so the restaurant was still busy. We were told the wait would be 30 minutes and given a pager. The wait ended up being much longer. At least over 45 minutes.  However, the restaurant did try to make up for it by bringing some blueberry pancakes to our table right after we got seated.  I am fan of their Eggs Benedict options. I love that they let you mix and match.  I like the Chilaquillas Benedict and the Caprese Benedict. Their OMG! French Toast is delicious and decadent. We always get one order to share with the table.  On the lighter side, their Quinoa Porridge is good too.  My kids love this place and their hot chocolate. They also have a great menu for Morning Cocktails.  Their prices are a bit high but you do get a great dining experience. The decor is very cool and retro. Expect to wait especially on the weekends. Can't wait for their new location to open up in Kierland because that is in my neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! I had heard about Snooze for a couple years and tried to stop by a couple times at the Colorado location, but the wait was always too long. We came here on a Sunday morning and although it was pretty busy, we only waited about 30 minutes or so. The service was fast and professional. Our waiter was great with recommendations and suggestions. I had the pancake sampler and the sweet potato pancakes were AMAZING! My husband had the huevos rancheros and was not disappointed. So many of the menu items looked delicious, I can't wait to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"We went on Veteran's day, and waited over an hour to get seated, then an additional hour for our food.  There was six of us, and when the food arrived, it was all cold.  I thought the menu was very innovative, but we couldn't tell because it was all cold."}
{"text":"I was back at Snooze this morning. I usually make it here for breakfast every month or so, and the food/service is almost always great. This morning was a different story. I arrived around 8:45 and there was no wait for a table.. Lucky me ! !   I quickly was sat at a little two top table near the back. I had an idea of what I wanted, but always like to hear about the pancake of the day before finalizing my order. I sat and waited, and waited and waited. A busgirl was busy cleaning off tables around me, but no sign of a waitress. Finally, after 5 minutes, a waitress peers over the half wall and sees me sitting there. She comes over and asks if I would like something to drink. No apology for the delay or anything.. No mention of a daily special pancake. Just your very standard order taker..   I decide to try the OMG french toast with a side of ham. I had heard great things about the french toast and have never had it before. The food arrives before too long. The side of ham was actually two small pieces--one about an inch by 2 inches, and the other piece 2 inches square.. WTF? The french toast was promised to have fresh strawberries and coconut. A more appropriate description would be one strawberry cut in about 8 tiny pieces. It was supposed to be stuffed with mascarpone cheese. If there was at one time some mascarpone in between the brioche slices, it must have been spread on with a butter spreader because there was nothing between the bread slices resembling a creamy cheese. The flavor was good, but it definitely reads better on the menu that it was presented to me today. If what I got today was the spec for it and not a shorted version, maybe they should change the name from OMG french toast to Ehhhh French toast..  I will go back based on previous visits, but if this was my one and only trip, it would have been my last."}
{"text":"Great food. Great place to eat! Want something different? Eat at Snooze! Worth the wait time."}
{"text":"I think the food is good. The service is spotty. The prices are OK.  It is very popular, so expect to wait at any peak times."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good breakfast. I was over the hotel continental breakfast. Looked up Yelp and my yelp peeps didn't let me down.   Atmosphere is casual, easy and fun.  Service is smart (literally reading my mind), fast and on point.  Food is incredibly GOOD! I went for the french toast neat with a side of bacon. My coffee was the best I've EVER had. Seriously, EVER! This place did not disappoint. You owe it to yourself to have a phenomenal breakfast at Snooze."}
{"text":"Excellent food great service however the lady at the front needs people skills.   Can be rude"}
{"text":"Solid food. I got half and half if bella bella and chillaquiles benedict. Somehow I could tell my portion was so much smaller than other people's benedicts...maybe because I did half and half? But my hash was smaller portion too. :( maybe im imagining stuff because it was so good I wanted some more!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at Snooze and I absolutely love how light the breakfast meals are.   I ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie and the OMG French Toast. Although the pot pie was cream-based, the pairing with a light flaky pastry makes the whole portion light and airy. The flavoring is just right - not too salty.  The OMG French Toast was a much smaller portion than expected but it was amazing! The level of sweetness for the sauce is similar to those of condense milk.   Overall, I enjoyed the both breakfast picks, maybe more so for the French Toast since I have a thing for sweet breakfast."}
{"text":"I ordered over medium eggs and they came with very runny whites. The bacon was very burned. When I nicely told the waitress, she acted like I was being too picky."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places! Great selection for anyone. But BRING BACK THE CHILAQUILES BENNY!!!!!"}
{"text":"The first thing that comes to mind is how crowded and just plain loud it is every time I go. The second thing is that it's pretty expensive, and you don't get much variety in the way of all the breakfast foods people like, but they still charge you quite a bit for the little variety you do get. I do keep going anyway though because I live nearby, the food is alright and interesting/different, and the staff and building are nice enough, but those first two things make me really me ask \"how bad do I want it?\""}
{"text":"This is another fantastic Snooze Eatery!!! Heather, Zach (Asst Mgr) and Alec were wonderful!!! There were 5 of us and all of our breakfast was delicious. ASU is fortunate to have a great restaurant right in their midst!"}
{"text":"It's hard for me to give a breakfast place more than 4 stars, because breakfast is breakfast right? Well, Snooze earns the 5th star because it didn't miss on anything. The wait was an hour long on Sunday morning, but it's a popular place so can't ding them for that. The coffee was really good--you can read the long story about how it's from their partner farm in Guatemala or you can just drink and enjoy. Our group got a variety of breakfast items--French Toast, Corned Beef Hash, traditional Eggs Benedict, Chilaquiles Benedict, Scrambled Eggs. Our kind server also brought us out a complimentary speciality pancake, which was tasty. Everything was on point. The table was silent; everyone was enjoying their meal. I had the traditional eggs benedict (Ham Benedict III). The ham was shaved, which I surprisingly liked. The hollandaise was also light and not overpowering and not too thick. It's a long wait, but worth it."}
{"text":"Overall, I'm very impressed with this restaurant. The food is both delicious and healthy in my opinion. I was super happy to see that they had cage free eggs, free range pork, and gluten free options. I ordered the Havana Daydreaming Sammie  on gluten free toast. My fianc√© ordered their gluten free pancakes and wow they're amazing. I've come here several times after my first visit and never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"The perfect Sunday morning breakfast joint after a weekend of fun I can't believe they got me out of bed that early but MAN !! was that French toast worth it !! Have to come back next time were in town"}
{"text":"We are fans of Snooze AM.   We have visited two locations -- one in Phoenix and one in Tempe.   Service and food was consistent between the locations.     My son loves the pancake flights (you can build your own stack).  I love Juan's Tacos.  And my husband is a fan of their Omelettes.      I've read several of the reviews reference the long wait.   One trick to the long wait at this particular location (on Camelback Road) is you can order your meal To Go and they go sit at one of the tables right outside the restaurant (there are a few in front of My Sister's Closet).  The staff is super friendly and always willing to give an opinion on what to get."}
{"text":"This is such a good breakfast/brunch place! The environment is great, well besides the noise level which is pretty high, the food is amazeballs, and the drinks are also very good!  I went with my family and shared all of our foods with each other. Some of the foods we got were the burrito, pineapple upside down pancakes, the bananuttella pancakes, the eggs Benedict and some other dishes I forgot!  I wish this place had more TVs though - our group of 6 really wanted to watch a Yankees game and they were unable to grant our request.   Overall, good food, good environment, good servers, and lack of enough TVs to satisfy!"}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! Excellent Service, Excellent Food and everyone is smiling. They have great music and for people with hangovers.....they even have breakfast cocktails to bite the hair of the dog; i.e. Manhattans and whatnot. This place gets 's"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. We got the breakfast tacos which were HUGE. I got corned beef on mine at the suggestion of our server, which was a great call. Good coffee too. Good vibe - outdoor ping pong table, bags set. Would definitely return for breakfast when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I've only heard rave reviews about this place and had been encouraged for weeks to try this with the ever efficient quote of \"YOU Would LOVE This Place\", and part of that is true.  We went on a busy Sunday morning which is always a nice time for brunch and people watching. we also had just done a vigorous hike prior and were starving! We arrived around 10 am and we were Finally seated around 1045. only 20 mins past the given wait time, and without even an \"I'm so sorry the wait will be longer then expected\" or even a general nod in our direction. We were told to download an app and wait for our name to appear, we were never approached about our table being ready.  After being seated our server came by with waters (no straws) She was training a new employee and kindly introduced us to her. She then left the table and didn't return for about 5 mins to take our drink order. 1 beer and the hopes of a taster were ordered. the person who ordered the taster had to wait an extra 7 mins to place her drink order because our server was no where to be found. We were starving and wanting to order, seeing as we had 45 mins before being sat to browse their menu we all already knew what we were after. We finally were able to flag down our server and were able to order.  THE FOOD (actually came out pretty quick) man!!!! I wish I could review the food. I ordered a BREAKFAST BURRITO with the soyrizo (soy Chorizo) instead of eggs. my girlfriends ordered veggie omelets and scrambles, which looked amazing, and pancakes.  I had asked prior if the soyrizo was going to be spicy and was instantly put at ease that it was mild and full of flavor. I had one bite of my burrito and my mouth was on fire. if there was flavor it was masked by the intense amount of spices that were bombarding my taste buds. My girlfriends hash browns was more like wet mush in a ring, and the scramble was almost too much on the wet side for the eggs to have been cooked all the way thru. Too bad our server was also MIA yet again during our ENTIRE MEAL. I would have liked to have tried something I could actually eat considering my stomach was probably growling loud enough for our neighboring table to hear (even over the blaringly loud club dance music they were playing).  THE SERVICE I work in the F&B industry and have been a proud provider of excellent customer service for 15 years ( so I do sorta know what Im talking about, not saying Im the best.... I just understand what makes a complete experience) well we definatly got an experience alright.  Our service LACKED every quality of a good experience.  1)Drink orders were taken 5-12 mins after being seated.  2)we had top flag down our server after being sat for almost 20 mins to have our food order taken 3)NOT ONCE did the server stop by, after getting us the required condiments we had asked for in our food order, to see if our food was even to our liking!!!!! that is ELEMENTRY!!!! my plate was pushed to the side with one bite taken out with a napkin on top of it for close to 38 mins before our server returned. 4) SHE DIDNT EVEN ACKNOLEDGE the uneaten food when she did return 5) When the server was informed that the food was inediable she had the manager take care of it..... funny the manager didn't stop by.  Zero Stars for: Service was POOR and SLOW (the girl she was training was more attentive to the tables) Zero Stars for: The Food well they would probably get more stars if I had even been able to try any of it.   They do get one star however for D√©cor and Such, this place is super HIP and FUNKY with round booths and an open air concept. This is a place that wants to be seen.  All in All this was a disappointing experience and I wont be returning to give it a second chance. If any friends or relatives ask about this place I will highly discourage them from wasting their time and money."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food, coffee and staff are great! I love all their options, but my favorites are the egg benetics."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast very friendly staff!   Only downside is the long wait. I recommend the quinoa oatmeal."}
{"text":"By far the Best place for Breakfast in the Chandler and Gilbert areas!!!!!!!!!! The Atmosphere is great  and the servers always greet you with a smile on their face...We have eaten here on multiple occasions and I always look forward to too coming back!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. They let dogs into the patio dining area and there are puddles of pee scattered around. On top of that, they have ping pong balls bouncing around the pee-covered ground and on to tables. Waitresses will also pick up the balls when they roll around and then they're delivering food, though I doubt they're washing their hands afterwards. The food is decent, though high priced... that doesn't make up for the dog pee though."}
{"text":"Very fun environment! I have a lot of food allergies and they are very accommodating especially with my gluten allergy!!! I would recommend snooze for breakfast every weekend! also very accommodating to large orders for offices !!!!! As good as it gets!!!!"}
{"text":"Theme of snooze: ok food can only take you so far.   Snooze seems to be the recent love child of girls in yoga pants everywhere, who fill the abundance of time there is in Arizona with \" let's go to brunch!!! Fun!!!\" . This would be practical, if Arizona had the culture and weather of a large city.   Issues: exasperatingly long waits for tables (I don't have 3 spare hours for one meal, meaning from the time you wait over an hour until the time you are home), and patio seating. The patio would be nice if it wasn't in Arizona. I understand that they can't do anything about the ungodly heat or humidity but at least having a misters would do wonders. Fans would also be outside to at least take he edge off 120. Parking is also a night mare past 9 am   Positives: food is pretty good, sampled surreal dishes.  There is a lack of seasoning on some dishes but not others, and I could do without the ringed hash browns that are raw in the middle and not crunchy on the outside.   I bet this palace of breakfast would be amazing in Southern California or Colorado, but amounts to just ok here on the surface if the sun"}
{"text":"Funny, I've gone to the place next door all the time, avoiding the crowd and wait. Now I understand why snooze is always busy. I ordered the bene duo (Verde and bella); so good. I'm a bene connoisseur and I absolutely loved the southwestern take, so the Verde was my fave. Everything was tasty and flavorful. Hubby got the spuds deluxe. We both cleaned our plates. The only negative I have is that the music was a little too loud, as it often is at these modern hipster joints. I like being able to have a conversation with my meal companions and I kept having to ask the hubby to repeat himself. Still I enjoyed the food, the service was excellent and it was a pleasant overall experience. Already planning to invite friends here for brunch... Soon."}
{"text":"This is one of the best eateries me and my wife have ever ate at my wife has gluten allergy and they do all gluten breakfast manager Ramon is about one of the best , ride along with the staff couldn't ask for a better place to eat in the morning thanks guys . Terry & Julie"}
{"text":"I love Snooze!!  I've been to  their San Diego, Denver and now Phoenix spots.  Bennies are mud avorite item on the menu. With sliced tomatoes, of course."}
{"text":"Snooze absolutely blew my mind:  It was a regular day that my friend and I were going to yoga.. There happened to be an ASU football game going on making it difficult to find parking. So we did what anyone would do and decided to have breakfast instead of exercise. Snooze was just starting out at that point and we didn't know what to expect. We were seated at the breakfast bar and chatting about nothing in particular when we noticed two displaced (homeless) looking people with Starbucks cups walk by outside. We really did not think anything of it until one of them seated himself next to us. We kept talking about nothing in particular when this man interrupted us and commented on my friend's sparky shirt. He asked many questions, proceeded to become accusatory and generalizing college students, making us seem brainwashed or unaware of the world, and began on an endless tirade of conspiracy-like theories. At first I was intrigued and then realized that this person would not hear logic and did not want to discuss, more of lecture. It began to get uncomfortable. He would not leave us alone. In my mind, this man could have been a paying customer so I did not expect Snooze employees to get involved, but they did. They went out of their way to ensure that our experience in the restaurant was nothing but positive, even in situations seemingly out of their control, like this.  At first a server made eye contact with my friend, my friend made the \"save me\" eyes at the server. Then, a manager approached us from one side and asked us about our day, what we knew about the restaurant, and basically distracted us pleasantly while another server approached the gentleman to our left. This server asked the gentleman to wait at the front to be seated like everyone else. The gentleman did not want to leave and insisted that we also wanted to be engaged in conversation with him. At this point we were talking to the manager about all the restaurant locations, restaurant history, etc. My friend and I addressed the gentleman and told him we would like to eat in peace and thus the confrontation was over, thanks to the manager and server.  I was so pleasantly surprised that they would take the situation in their own hands, I assumed that it was our responsibility to stand up for ourselves and tell the gentleman we were done with the conversation, after all, we are adults. I was incredibly impressed by Snooze already and would not stop raving to my friend about what great customer service that was. Then, a completely new server came by and apologized for the situation, and offered us a sweet potato pancake (it was amazing). Later, another server came by and asked us what happened and apologized and we laughed about it. Then the manager asked us if they could get us anything off of the menu and we politely declined, they've done so much for us already! Finally, we asked for the check and were ready to pay when our original server apologized for the situation and told us they covered our bill!! Like, what??!! We were so shocked and impressed and thankful that we tipped (more than we would have paid for the meal) because that's what great customer service does to you, it makes you feel things! And write novels on Yelp! And endlessly talk about a restaurant and refer all of your friends there! This entire situation was out of Snooze's control, but they made the decision to control the situation. They didn't aim for us to have a satisfactory experience, but an unforgettable one.   And to think, it all started with us not finding parking for yoga."}
{"text":"They are phenomenal here!!! The best service I have ever had in my life plus GF everything! Amy runs the team like no other! The entire staff works together effortlessly to ensure that no one is ever out of water, coffee, etc. I would recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Awesome! There's nothing I like more than a hip Breakfast joint, and even more so a hip breakfast joint with a liquor license! Snooze had it all! Really cool retro/ jetson vibe.  Really bright colors, orange, yellow! Sunny and happy! We sat at the bar only had about 45 minutes before our flight home.  Melinda ( I think) was really great, friendly and took great care of us and was fun to chat with. I had a great chili infused tequilla iced cinnamon coffee and a grapefruit, pama, elderflower MIMOSA! So fun! Also, their Champage was on draft!!! Food was great too! I had the winter harvest eggs benedict and really great bacon! Wish we lived closer! I would totally be a regular! Thanks for a fun time!"}
{"text":"HOMOPHOBIC AND RACIST!!!!! My friend and I got attacked by a manager's friend who threatened to beat my friend to death only because he was a black gay male wearing an army camo print t-shirt!?!? This happened in the Phoenix facility with the manager Blake standing RIGHT next to this man and smiling while his friend was dropping death threats to us. We were minding our business and to be attacked like that for no reason and with the FULL SUPPORT of the manager is UNACCEPTABLE !!!!! If you want death threats with your overpriced poached eggs, this is great place for it. Make sure you say hi to racist, homophobic, incompetent  manager Blake."}
{"text":"I just tried this place the other day and got the continental breakfast, ( grapefruit, yogurt, and toast). The yogurt was amazingly yummy! The granola in it was delicious. I really like the idea of the br√ªl√©e grapefruit but I ended up taking off the sugar cause I am just too messy.   It was super busy when I went in which is always a good sign and I look forward to going back and trying some new items!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed of this place. We were seated 1 hour after putting our name down -busy on Sunday, however, our food took another hour to be served and it was cold. I ordered eggs Benedict (no one wants cold poached eggs) they were served cold and besides the eggs being tiny, they were supposed to come with ham and the second was green chili pork. I paid $12 for two tiny pieces of eggs with a tiny piece of ham and my green chili pork was barely 1 oz of meat. Disappointing! The only good thing was the upside down pancakes -they were big and yummy, but for $9 never again. We finally left by 11 am. Almost 3 hours to eat breakfast. Overpriced food, slow service and cold food. No thanks. I rather walk across the street to Liberty Market for a quick and delicious breakfast with lots of value. Obviously this place can't handle all the people coming in. Management needs to do something about it. Lost a costumer here."}
{"text":"I want to give this place more. I really liked it, food was high quality, wait was good for a Sunday morning for two people, atmosphere is awesome, but the benedicts are really poor portion size for the cost."}
{"text":"I trusted Snooze with my birthday breakfast (a Thursday at nine am) and was fairly pleased. The Palomimosa (tequila, grapefruit juice, and some other tasty shit) was quite serviceable. Bella Bella Benny was solid, the Winter Harvest was meh. The latter had a corn cake that was too soft and mealy, particularly with Snooze's signature mushy ass potatoes (made in a food mold or some such shit, like rilly?? I want it CRISPY.) But the beans and Brussels Sprouts with it were nummy, eggs were not quite but almost runny enough and the hollandaise was v v good. And the date bread french toast was stellar, just needed an extra scoop of marscapone.  The music at this location was just god frickin awful. BAD pop music blaring, like four on the floor at nine am?? Stahp it. Nicki Minaj was the parting shot, but it was not enough the make up for the Jesse goddamn McCartney. Get it together, Gilbert location.  Service was good, little slow but friendly enough."}
{"text":"The 'corned beef hash' menu description did not include potatoes, so I asked the waitress and she told me that there were a little potatoes in it. This seemed to be the most protein laden menu item, but what was served was an order of hash browns with a sprinkling of corned beef. Resolving the issue on our check became difficult and the manager made me feel guilty for the whole thing. Also getting a refill for our tea and coffee took forever, there was no one offering refills."}
{"text":"4of5 stars since we sat out on the patio(few flies). Decent service, fresh ingredients, healthy portions. Music sounded like it came from my own Playlist."}
{"text":"First time ...and loved it!!  Food was amazing!!  A bit annoyed by flies though.  Don't sit near the window or back door.  The staff was great and our waitress was on it!!  We were at Gilbert location and will go back."}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly and prompt. The reason for the 3 stars is because the food was bland and the serving size was small for the price. I ordered the salad for lunch thinking it would taste great with all the wonderful ingredients listed, but it was just average tasting."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix recently and stayed at the hotel near this place. I ended up going there everyday of my stay lol. I sat at the bar and each time the service was great.  Love the french toast and the Drunken Punk'n Pancakes are my guilty pleasure.  Will be back there soon. I have not tried the coffee yet so that is on my to do list."}
{"text":"Long wait, but will worth it. The staff was very friendly, very nicely decorated. My mother has celiac disease and I'm gluten intolerant. They were more than accommodating to our needs. We got the sweet potato pancakes with a side of bacon. This was to die for. I will be back every time I venture out to Phoenix. There was a forty five minute wait, but there are plenty of shops to fill your time. Well worth the wait!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food that hit all the right notes. Delicious cold brew coffee that was very necessary on a 100-degree morning on the patio. Very friendly service, convenient location."}
{"text":"Have been to snooze two times and each visit has not been far from impressive.  I have been a server for nine years so I try to be very understanding of the potential for things to go wrong within the restaurant, but a good attentive server whom is apologetic when things do go wrong can save a bad visit.  Each time I have been to snooze the servers are far from accommodating and unfriendly.  Today my friend and I came into eat and the visit started as an average experience.  We ordered quickly and the bartender was prompt.  Our food however took along time to come out, about 25-30 minutes and when it arrived both plates of good were very cold.  It took us about five minutes to track down a different employee to send it back. While we waited for our plates to be remade we were not offered refills on empty drinks or offered another bar drink. The plates than took another 20 minutes to be remade.  I was appreciative that the manager came and apologized and offered to take care of our entrees.  When one of the bartenders came and dropped the tab she said well as the meals were taken care of so hope that made you happy.  It was a very snide and rude remark and first of all we didn't want the meal comped.  We wanted hot food and in a timely fashion. Needless to say after her comment I will no longer return to snooze. I can make a better, more pleasant breakfast at home and I would rather give my business to a more pleasant and deserving staff."}
{"text":"Snooze is top of the food chain for breakfast. One of the best breakfast places in the country without a doubt. Everyone who works here seems incredibly happy. Wait times get long, so plan out when you intend to come. Aka don't come on a Saturday morning and expect seating right away. Pancake flights are out of this world!!"}
{"text":"Went around 9:45am this morning with 2 of my great friends. We all ordered breakfast drinks I had the mule...amazing taste had a hint of bitterness that went well with my HUGE breakfast burrito that came with chorizo, ham,onions,hash browns and green sauce. My friend got the orange smoothie cocktail and said it tasted like an orange Julius She also had the Huge breakfast burrito with sausage. The third bestie of our party had the Spicy Bloody Mary and I took a sip of it and it was probably the best BM I've ever had its ratio of tomato juice  spices spot on. She ordered the flight of pancakes which included 3 different flavors of pancakes She choose Strawberry Cheesecake, chocolate molten lava and caramel apple These were absolutely delish and not overwhelmingly sweet. I like meat for Breakfast so most likely I will never order the flight but will share a forkful with my kids because , I will be bringing them here soon"}
{"text":"Good service, food and cocktails!!! Perfect place to go if your local or out of town.... Don't let the line deceive you, sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Fresh squeezed orange juice and benedicts to die for.  Love the ham benedict, but can't eat all that food so they let me do a half order.  It is always crowded, but I sit at the bar which is just fine."}
{"text":"I took my son and nephew for the first time to your restaurant in gilbert and we enjoyed our meal, but I am writing about Ramon, who literally took the shirt off of his back and absolutely made my nephews year. He ( age 14) is raising a hog for school, and your t shirts for pork 2015 was something that he hoped that I could buy. Unfortunately your store was out, but Ramon insisted that I have his.I offered money which he also declined. My family will continue to dine here with customer service like this. Made our Christmas!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far and waited 40 minutes the first time and 75 minutes the second. I guess this is a true sign of how delicious the place is... Especially since I didn't even mind. There is plenty to do in the shopping center to keep you busy but plan on waiting on the weekends!  Their various egg Benedict options are delicious especially since there are 3 different hollandaise sauces to choose from - cream cheese, cheddar and Dijon! The pancakes are very yummy so get a flight so you can try three! I recommend the sweet potato, pineapple upside down cake and blueberry Danish. I am not a sweet breakfast person but these were too good to pass up!"}
{"text":"I went in to Snooze for the first time today after hearing great things. It was pretty busy and seemed pretty cool. After getting seated I waited for 10 minutes. I was never greeted, so decided to leave and go to Denny's. I work as a server, so I know it's unacceptable for that to happen, and while I was willing to give benefit of the doubt because of how busy it was, there were for too many people working for that to happen. On the way out I also got the most fake smile I've ever seen. I was very disappointed I didn't eat at Snooze, and may try again, but I'm not tipping a server if I have to flag one down after waiting 10 minutes to be greeted, and as a server that's saying something to not want to tip."}
{"text":"Ramon  and Mat at the Gilbert location took making customers happy to a whole new level. They allowed my sister and I to choose the pancake of the day. We chose Red velvet pancakes on August 31, which is our late mom's birthday and her favorite pan cakes. For my sister and I we will never forget this special breakfast and the people that went above and beyond!' Thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts!!"}
{"text":"Incredible pancakes. You can make your own with  a flight. Also infuse their own vodka for bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"I went to Snooze in Denver two and a half years ago and have been dreaming about going back ever since.  I was ecstatic to learn this morning while searching for a place for breakfast that one was here in Phoenix! It was as fantastic as I remembered.  The OMG French Toast was worthy of my dreams the last couple of years.  Fantastic.    Prepare to wait to get in- but once you're in the service is fast, friendly and fabulous.  Everyone is so friendly.    They do get your number and text you when your table is ready- which is nice- that means you can shop in the surrounding stores or have one person drop in and put your name down and then come back in an hour when your table is ready."}
{"text":"If I could rate any higher, I would! You will probably have a little bit of a wait time but it's worth waiting for! The food is great, the prices are good and the people are fantastic! My friend and I were talking for a while at our table after we were done eating and they asked us to move to a smaller table so they can get a large party in which was no problem. I think it was the manager that asked us if we wanted a free drink, I was thinking a coffee but he ended up getting us free mimosas for simply moving to another table! Super cool guy! Will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I found this restaurant online and decided since we were in the Phoenix area for the day we would try it out and man was it a good idea! The food is amazing! My fianc√© loves eggs benedict so he was in heaven having so many choices!! We will definetly be going back!"}
{"text":"Food was consistently delicious. We ordered two pancake flights and two duo Benny's. These are awesome ways to go -- you get to try more than amazing dish.  It was a great place to bring my autistic daughter. She enjoyed the rhythmic reggae and nobody in the place gave a second thought to her stereotype. Once we were in the booth, which provides good lighting but lots of seclusion, she was very happy. Servers were great with her."}
{"text":"This place changed everything. I went in the middle of a huge argument with my girlfriend over what would be our power couple name would be but as soon as we entered the restaurant, it all went away. It's like we stepped through a wormhole leading to breakfast heaven. The candy apple pancakes restored my faith in humanity. A choir of angels sounded as I took my first bite. I watched a blind man get his sight after one piece of bacon, and the chickens came out to personally introduce each egg. There was something cool about the coffee I don't remember, but it tastes like liquid nirvana. Long story short, don't go here if you hate good food, a friendly staff, or life in general."}
{"text":"Oh Snooze how we love thee!!! Everything was absolutely wonderful! We waited a while before we got seated however I can see why this place is so popular. My husband had the \"Pancake Flight\" where he got the OMG French Toast, Pineapple Pancake and Apple Pie Pancake... Seriously AMAZING. I got the simple 3-egg breakfast... EVERYTHING was cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here while visiting friends. Great service and great food. It was about a 45 minute wait for a table but it was on a Sunday mid morning."}
{"text":"Went in last weekend, the food was to die for. Loved seeing Micheladas on the drink menu. Service was excellent, they were swamped but we still got everything we asked for. There was a 20 minute wait to get a table, but we got free coffee while we waited so I couldn't possibly complain. Also the host working was very good about communicating and was very courteous.  Only complaint was that the music playing made me feel like I was shopping at Forever 21. I wish breakfast food could be as delicious when ordered to-go, because the ambiance there was just not for me."}
{"text":"I had the hash browns with spinach, mushroom, and avocado. I'm vegan, so it was cool that they could make me something that fits my diet. They also have almond milk for coffee drinks. My (non-vegan) friend had the pot pie and she liked it a lot. The wait was 25-40 minutes a little before 11 on a Sunday. The restaurant will text you when your table is ready. You can also download an app that lets you know how many people are in front of you. Our server was very nice, and she went above to find me something to eat that wasn't a bunch of sides or fruit. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great first time there experience. Great food and service. Lisa our server was fantastic!! She was very knowledgeable and gave us superb service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  Wait was long.  30+ minutes so they offered complementary coffee.  I brought my complementary coffee to the table and was offered a refill, and when they brought the bill, they charged me for it.  I didn't say anything because the food and the service was so great, but a bit miffed that my \"complementary\" coffee became $2.75."}
{"text":"Cute brunch place to visit. Nice atmosphere, staff is friendly, food is portioned well.  Tried the 3 egg omelet with spinach, bacon and cheddar cheese.  Wait time was about ~30 min on a busy Monday Holiday morning. Definite must try for those visiting."}
{"text":"The food and service gross, it's not for the sophisticated palette. It parallels fast food. .I have been  two times I will never go back. ..and I have told many family and friends. .the Java horrendous,  service horrendous. .food has a lot to be desired.."}
{"text":"-Snooze Spuds Delux with chorizo and bacon - super hearty. My soon to be son-in-law who doesn't know it yet, loved it and the thick slices of bacon earned it 5 out of 5 stars.  ~Pancake flight with pancake of the day (blackberry), blueberry danish, and pineapple upside down. My daughter loved the blackberry the best .. hidden caramelized walnuts in the pancake gave it the oohhh-what's-this surprise. Upside down and blackberry pancakes were excellent as well. 5 out of 5.   ~Benny Dua with chilaquilles and chili verde: very nicely done and well presented. It was an interesting take on eggs Benedict. It wasn't as saucy so the flavor would permeate but it was delicious nevertheless. 4 out of 5 ~OMG! French toast: never came. So we got this taken off our bill. Glad though because we didn't realize that was hellalot of food after we had put in the order.  ~Fall greens- I had to represent the healthy side of the family. Would order this again. Greens were fresh and the sweetness of the beets and the saltiness of the thick chunks of bacon perfectly complimented the naturally  lightly bitterness of the baby kale. 5 out of 5.  Flip was our friendly server. Not going to blame him for the OMG French toasts because we didn't need them anyway.  The restaurant was well lit, open, and clean. It has a welcoming aura to it.   Restroom is clean."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Colorado so I was so excited to see that they opened a snooze down in the valley! The pancakes...Amazing! The breakfast tacos are probably my favorite though. My girl friend and I went in to get some breakfast and couldn't have been more impressed with the service and the food. I'm 99% sure the girl that served us was named Parker and she did such a great job at making us feel welcome and she put a smile on both of our faces! I have worked in the food industry for most of my working career and its very hard to find good service. Not with Parker! I will definitely be coming back and very soon!! And if its possible I'm asking for the same server! :)  (I really hope I got the girls name right...?)"}
{"text":"Had brunch today! Was delicious from Bloody Mary to the B.E.A.T sandwich. Service was excellent!! Bobbi was polite and very friendly. There was a brief down pour; which being from Oregon wasn't a real issue but Bobbi insisted on opening an umbrella to keep my party dry.... Thank you Snooze for a wonderful experience..."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in town.  I have not had a single bad experience at any Snooze location.  If you are a meat and potatoes person, they have a pile of hash browns with whatever fixings you want!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast in town.  I have not had a single bad experience at any Snooze location.  If you are a meat and potatoes person, they have a pile of hash browns with whatever fixings you want!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back! Luckily, the boyfriend and I had a Wednesday morning off and could come when it's not standing room only. I ordered the Chilaquiles Benedict which was so delicious. The hollandaise sauce was spicy goodness! The boyfriend ordered the hash and I assume it was good considering he cleaned his plate in about 5 minutes. Will definitely be coming back to sample the Bloody Mary menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! I had the breakfast burrito and my boyfriend tried the  Chilaquiles Benedict and we both cleared our plates. Not going to lie, my burrito was pretty good but his dish was even better so I highly recommend that. It was a small factor but the music choice was also pretty epic. I'm down to eat breakfast and bob my head to some BiggieBiggieBiggie can't you see.  Unfortunately this place loses a star to its subpar coffee. If you're paying over $10 a plate you deserve a good cup of coffee."}
{"text":"This place is delicious every time. We've been to the one in Denver, Phoenix, La Jolla, and San Diego. All amazing!!! We will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Tried to visit but too much construction on college avenue - had to go all around from north only to discover parking must be paid at the building in the back about a football field away! Worst location for a restaurant - should be commercial or education based locale."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Our waitress was amazing! I had the breakfast pot pie, it was fantastic! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Food is really delicious, but be prepared to wait, especially on the weekends. My husband and I biked by one day and decided to get brunch. Coffee was great and they have lots of fun breakfast drinks. It took a while for food to come, but it was worth it. We had a great time sitting outside drinking coffee and watching people go by. Have been back several times since then."}
{"text":"Unique and delicious food. The staff was wonderful and let me bring my puppy in due to being out of town on vacation! The continental is a flavorful choice with Carmel brulee grapefruit and agave nectar Greek yogurt mmm"}
{"text":"Food was great, but not worth the hour and a half wait. Would have been easier if they said it would be 90 minutes instead of 30-45 minutes. Asked the hostess how much longer it might be at the 50 min mark and she said she doesn't know. If we knew it was going to be that long, we would have gone somewhere else. Seems to be slow at cleaning tables and getting people moving. When we were seated, the service was slow as well, which I imagine contributed to the problem. Once we got our food, it was amazing. Not sure how much of it was due to us being that much more hungry though. Would go back if the wait isn't that long but should have left after a half hour."}
{"text":"Was here awhile ago visiting family, fabulous! Today on a Thurs. morn. We waited about 15 min. then waited 'Forever'  for our breakfast, there must have been a problem...then my breakfast pot pie, the egg on top and even the rosemary gravy was cold! Everyone elses breakfast was great. We will be back, but I will stick to the OMG French toast or eggs."}
{"text":"Food was good. Mascarpone is amazing on blueberry muffins, pricey for smaller portion of quality foods. The server actually gave us a complimentary pancake being first-timers as we were.   Atmosphere was great. I like the decor--a bit retro but √† la mode as well. Out door seating area is handsome and the red brick ties it all together. I love the decor of the place.   One complaint is that their orange juice tasted odd. I don't know if it was just the cup, but definitely not ordering that again."}
{"text":"PROS Nice atmosphere, dog friendly patio. Great coffee. Good food CONS lax service, no actual 'traditional' food offerings  I've been several times and will continue to go, but wish they'd improve the service.  Would be 3-1/2 stars if that were an option."}
{"text":"We had a weekday brunch visit. The food was fine, but our bleach blonde server took to my husband right away and proceeded to flirt with him each time she came to the table, while barely acknowledging me. Based on her actions, my husband may as well have been eating alone. For example, after our food was brought to the table, she stood there and inquired with him about something random, staring at him intently, and lingered far too long for our comfort. Funny she didn't inquire about his wedding band.  We dine out a lot and have never seen this happen. The audacity of this waitress was shocking."}
{"text":"Great place to eat for brunch! The service was great and the food was amazing. Minus the 30 minute wait, I had a great time at Snooze. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First and last time!  We thought we would be in for a treat because of all the people. Nay, nay. Salmon Benedict was way too salty, pancakes could have been better. Tiny roll of butter, watery thin syrup, bacon cooked too well done and undercooked on the same plate. Sorry Snooze - very big disappointment."}
{"text":"Unbelievable,  one of the best breakfast spots I have ever been too.  Any of their Bennys are amazing.  I had the ham and the beef Benny,  so good!  I will make this a regular spot for me.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning, about 11am. Was pretty packed but went on to put in a name anyway for two. Was told it would be about a 45min wait, I said it was fine and walked outside. I looked around and realized this was going to be more than a 45min wait. I decided to leave and not cancel just to see how accurate they were being with giving out times. Turns out it was more of an hour to hour and 15min wait. Thankfully we left because we ended up at Chelsea's Kitchen which was only a 15min wait and SO good."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in the west!  I have been to snooze in Denver but get sick of waiting an hour every time. This location is every bit as good as the original with no wait.  What's better than starting the day with pineapple upside down pancakes and a mimosa? Their pancakes are always great, and gluten free by request. I've never had a bad meal at snooze and this location was more of the same.  To top off the amazing food they have a beautiful patio to take in the Arizona sun."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, incredible service and great vibe. Loved it so much went back-to-back days on vacation. Best breakfast around!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in my life. Ever. Serious. I had the green eggs n ham sandwich. My wife had the tacos. My son the pancake flight. All outstanding. And first rate service; Alex the best. If you are near this place do not pass up the chance to have an incredible meal."}
{"text":"Their selection of gf items is what brings me here. I had the pineapple upside down pancake and bacon today. Crispy bacon, and it was cooked perfectly. The pancake is huge, just the right amount of sweetness and pancake. If you are dining alone, there is rarely a wait at the counter. Service was great; I've never had bad service here."}
{"text":"This place looks very cute I love the whole vibe and atmosphere. However, it seems as though each time I come here, which has been more than 5 times with different people, I get not so great service. Initially I thought it may have been a one time thing or perhaps they're just busy, but the last time I went was the final straw for me. We waited about 20 minutes after being seated to have someone take our order (we werent even offered drinks yet) and even then I had to wave over one of the servers to our table. Almost 30 minutes went by before I was about to pay for my chai and leave that our food came out at the last minute. After quickly eating because we were pretty hungry, I then had to wave over someone else for the check (we never actually saw who our server was supposed to be). There were maybe 5 other families that were sat down long after us that got drinks and food while we barely put in our orders. After this time I dont think Ill be going back, but I did try several times to give them a chance."}
{"text":"THE BEST GLUTEN FREE PANCAKE I'VE EVER HAD!  Oh my goodness, the large crowd and long wait time didn't matter. Their sweet potato pancake was so amazingly fluffy and flavorful. Kate, my server, was super friendly and brought everything on time.  It was a great experience, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Super high energy vibe and super loud joint. Service was mediocre. The food is really good though! Definite noms"}
{"text":"First time trying Snooze. Had great expectations but unfortunately our duo Benny plate came without some of the necessary accompaniments, like hollandaise. However, our server Kate let the manager Adrienne know, and they handled it quickly and professionally. Hence the five stars. Kate's service was impeccable and Adrienne's to handle the situation with grace is why we are giving the five stars! And we are coming back to try another dish and give it another go! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Jessica is the best! Always making great conversation and is so attentive! Will keep coming back for the amazing food and great service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We were surprised by this place. I guess I was expecting a low key traditional breakfast, but the menu is definitely more upscale. I was a little worried when reading the menu that the food would be to foo foo, but unjustly so. I ordered the Bella Bella Benedict, which came with a small arugula salad and hash browns. It was so good! My husband go the breakfast pot pie and raved about the puff pastry crust. I had a little food envy when I saw the people next to us get pancakes - looked great. We will be back to try them!"}
{"text":"Simply fantastic. Try the soyrizo omelet with mushrooms, avocado and cheddar. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here and while it does not seem busy, it took longer than we would have thought to get our food."}
{"text":"Great breakfast selection. Perfect day to enjoy breakfast and pineapple mimosa on the patio."}
{"text":"Heard about the Snooze from a friend who frequents their other location on Camelback.   I was forewarned that any Snooze location, including the ASU campus will be busy, more like packed.  You can't blame the masses when the pancakes are really,  really delicious. Started with a Mimosa and lox that came with arugula salad, herbed goat cheese, bread that resembled crudite,  and tapenade of sundried tomatoes with capers.  It was really good, much tastier than the usual lox bagel you can buy anywhere.  My friend shared the pancake fight.  We got the sweet potato pancake which was so yummy.  We couldn't finish the other pancakes cause we were full.  But, I wanna try some of the other items on the menu next time.   BTW, although it was crowded and was told it would be a long wait, we got seated in 5 minutes cause we didn't mind the patio.  It was hot but glass of water is always helpful."}
{"text":"I have been here before and had yummy experience but this weekend was not so good.  Wait time was good, service was fast but food?  ehhh not so much.  The eggs were oily! I had to pat them dry for my daughter, they were slippery for her lil toddler hands.  The corned beef hash has overcooked and my bacon was droopy.  Bleh."}
{"text":"Have breakfast for the first time... Service was quick and friendly. The menu had a lot of items. Ordered beat sandwich... Delicious. They use really good bread which is key for a sandwich. I love the one have French toast with sausage patty... She loved it. My cortado was awesome. The place is really good for a chain."}
{"text":"This is a great, casual and family friendly breakfast spot. We arrived and there was an hour wait.  They took my cell phone number and I immediately got a text letting me know that they would give me advanced notice when the table was going to be ready. We were then able to go enjoy walking around the farmers market and craft fair while we waited for our table.   After about 15 minutes we started making our way back to the restaurant and as we were approaching I received a text message that our table was ready - they had the time down perfectly.  And I haven't even gotten to the food yet...   The bottom line is that the food was great, the adults and older kids loved their dishes and they had a great option for a kids meal. Despite the lengthy wait, they made it as convenient and laid-back as possible and this will definitely be a regular breakfast spot when I am in Gilbert."}
{"text":"This is going to be my new go to place for Breakfast/brunch. Although we had about a 45 min wait, which we were informed of, the service was not affected by the crowd. Jeff was our waiter and did an excellent job reviewing and explaining menu choices. We had a small mishap with one of our orders, and the kitchen corrected it, but then Jeff topped that with a kinda brunch dessert on him to make up for it. He brought us a pumpkin/pancake/topped with nuts that was fabulous! Thanks Jeff and thanks for not making us feel rushed even though the restaurant was packed! We were four ex-coworkers/friends looking to eat good food and catch up. Not dissappointed."}
{"text":"Let's start with the service, it's not that great. Waitresses are unfriendly and treat you like they are doing you a favor by doing their job.  The food however is WONDERFUL. The Eggs Benedict are so good. They have so many options and all are great!"}
{"text":"Go Cubs Go!!!   First of all, a lot things went right with this place. For starters they have a really nice patio area overlooking part of ASU. In addition to that they have a nice ping pong table and bean bag game out there as well.   The joint is right on ASU campus in Tempe with some additional restaurants in the surrounding area. Came here on a nice warm sunny Wednesday morning in November with my cousin for breakfast. I ordered three eggs with chicken sausage and hash browns and substituted toast for an upside down pineapple pancake.I will have to say that the pancake was a good size for being a single and oh yeah it tasted awesome! The eggs and chicken sausage were nice and hot the way a great breakfast should be.  As I was enjoying my breakfast I realized how much this place reminded of a breakfast place that I frequent in the Chicago suburbs named Jam N' Jelly. Snooze AM had the same awesome feel to it with the exception of having much nicer November weather than Chicago...duh right?  In addition to all the greatness mentioned above I picked up really quick on how a few of the servers there were wearing Chicago Cubs shirts and that right there earned them an extra star!  If you happen to be in the ASU area and are looking for a great, friendly, tasty breakfast place that has outside dinning, a long side a cool ping pong table, and bean bag game. Then I highly recommend this place and definitely go for some of the specialty pancakes they have on their menu."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Snooze--we only wished that we had found this place sooner!  If it were possible to rate this delicious find with TEN stars, it deserves it.  The incredibly scrumptious breakfast delights and the excellent customer service from the wonderful management and staff have put Snooze on our \"favorites\" list.  Please ask for Claire who made our first time so very special.  She took such great care of us and provided a wonderful surprise.  The Benny Duo allowed us to taste the Chile Verde Benny and the Chilaquiles Benedict.  We savored the perfectly poached eggs, the very flavorful barbacoa and pulled pork meats all placed on ranchero and green chile sauced layers of tortilla.  We also recommend the Pancake Flight--your choice of three different pancakes.  We were delighted with the Pineapple Upside Down, Sweet Potato and Blueberry Danish pancakes!  These are the best pancakes we have ever eaten!  The pancake is perfectly cooked--truly a \"pan cake\"--delicious, light and very hard to stop eating!  Be sure to ask about the \"cinnamon roll\" pancake--it's not on the menu.  Worth TEN stars and more!!!!!"}
{"text":"So happy that snooze has opened up within walking distance! I love this place... Sometimes the wait can be a little bit long but they have coffee for you to sip while you wait so I don't mind :) service has always been great and I haven't tried anything on the menu that I don't like yet."}
{"text":"We were excited to try a new independent restaurant in the neighborhood, but we ended up a bit disappointed. We we understanding of the wait on a holiday weekend, but it took nearly 45 minutes to get our food once we ordered.  Good news....we did enjoy the food once it arrived.   The management handled the situation very well, because of this we will likely try them again, but there seem to be a lot of bugs to work out!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch. I want one of these to come to Kentucky so I can eat here on the regular. We had a terrible time determining what we wanted since everything sounded so good. Our compromise was to get a Duo of Bennys and a Pancake Flight. Every single item was delicious. If I was forced to order just ONE of the food items again, I think I would order the Ham III Benny, but really, it doesn't seem like you can go wrong given our experience. The Pear Spritz was hands down our favorite cocktail - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The good: the pancake flights are fun, the staff is friendly, good service, the decor is cute.   The not-so-good: the bottom line for me is that this place is just not delicious enough to justify the ever-present wait time. There are so many great brunch places in the midtown area that aren't chains and you won't wait this long. I am willing to wait for something extraordinary, but Snooze just isn't it. I have never had anything at Snooze that was worth the wait time. The food is mediocre. Also, the music- if anyone remembers \"Jock Jams\" from the 90's, that type of music was playing on loop at top volume the last time I was in there. Super obnoxious and a lot to take in the morning."}
{"text":"EAT HERE!! I wish I could give this place 10 stars. This is the best breakfast ever. It is always a wait, today we waited 45 min (Memorial Day), but it is soooo worth it.   My daughter had chocolate chip pancakes and ate every bite. I had the chilaquiles benedict. It was so flavorful and the egg was perfect and runny. It sits on top of corn tortillas and is topped with a cotija cheese hollandaise sauce. It was simply magical. A MUST try.   Our sever, Desiree, was very nice and attentive. She also said that's her favorite Benedict on the menu.   Try it, they won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"This morning we ventured out on our 4th visit to Snooze in Gilbert. We love the space and the servers always have been friendly. Our only complaints during previous visits have been the long wait for the food (breakfast should be FAST) and the food was not hot (ranging from somewhat warm to cold).   Today, we had a lovely server who brought coffee and cream right away. We ordered two dishes to share and several sides. Regrettably all of the food was served at room temperature. Because we ate cold food during our third visit, we decided to send it back this time in the hopes of having a hot breakfast. It was nearly 10 minutes until we found someone to bring the food back to the kitchen and then another 10-15 minutes until we received our meals, which again were not quite hot (but ranged from room temperature to warm).   The server felt bad that our food was cold and we waited so long, so she asked the manager to come speak with us directly. He was pleasant, but never apologized. Oddly, we felt as if he was scolding us for not being truthful. He did remove several of the items from our check, but we cared less about the money and more about a commitment to serving hot food in the future. Alas, our hopes dashed at another promising Gilbert restaurant."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Was introduced to them in Denver where it is a staple for breakfast. I just moved to Phoenix this weekend and couldn't believe they were here. I've been here everyday since Friday and will probably hit it one more time for good measure tomorrow.   Everything about this place is great. Great service, great coffee, fantastic food, good portions, creative dishes, great flavors, cool retro scene. I travel all the time for work and this is one of my top three breakfast places in the country.   It is a couple of blocks to my office so I'm sure I'll be a quick regular. Good place to entertain clients as well."}
{"text":"This is the first place that gets five stars from me!  The service was awesome.  The blackberry pancakes were terrific!  The pit pot is great!  Lolita our server is awesome I want to come back!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with some of the dishes but the B.E.A.T sandwich was REALLY good. This place kick's IHOP in the butt but I expected more based on the street talk."}
{"text":"Today I just stopped in for a few beers. Nikki was my bartender today and she definitely hit the mark on  the high standard set for the people working for the company. They have Great Divide Colette Saison on tap. Delish. I have had their food several times at the town and country location and I've found two things to be consistent. Great food and quality peeps. Thumbs up on the Gilbert location. Welcome!"}
{"text":"The service and food was incredible. I went with two friends at 7am, we had coffee, mimosas, breakfast burritos, pancakes and the eggs Benedict. Portions, presentations and taste was A1! The culture in terms of the workers and atmosphere gave us a happy and positivity feeling. All around 5 stars on this review!"}
{"text":"The Benedict's are fantastic, but the classic ham is the best. The hash browns were a bit salty, but they were happy to make it without salt.   They had a sugary pancake special; if you buy it, part of proceeds support the Sunnyslope HS sports program, which I thought was cool. It was actually really tasty (for not having a super sweet tooth,)  Had the Mm mm Mimosa, also delicious.   Great service, I've been twice now and am happy to return again!"}
{"text":"Had the Chilaquiles Benedict with Barbacoa and it was fabulous! The hubby had the Snooze burrito but it was lacking egg and was a bit dry without adding meat. We had them bring out a side of Barbacoa and avocado and it took away the dryness. Both dishes had great flavor though!   If you hate crowds avoid coming here on a Sunday because it's their busiest day. Also, if you put up with an obnoxious drunkard in the restaurant your server will likely give you the \"Pickle\" discount which is 20% off your bill!!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place with it's cute decor and giant coffee mugs. We went in on a weekday morning where there was enough staff on for every table to have their own server. After waiting 10 minutes to be greeted by a server that looked mildly annoyed she had an opportunity to make money while at her job... I ordered a coffee, my husband ordered a pineapple juice. The juice never came. We ordered breakfast.. Maybe the juice was being fresh squeezed? My husband ordered pancakes, I ordered the chilaquiles benedict. The pancakes came out like pancakes... The Benedict looked like everything my breakfast loving heart desired. The first bite was cold... I assessed it to be the mass amount of pico piled on top. A few more bites... Meh. Tried the other half without all the pico... ICE COLD meat. Appetite killed with the fear that Id be yacking up food poisoning later. After our server finally showed up.. Still no pineapple juice.... I informed her of the ice cold meat (Cold as if they took it out of the freezer, forgot to prep it and just piled it on top). She asked if I wanted another one. I declined saying I didn't have time to wait for another meal as my husband was already finished with his breakfast and it was a weekday. She said she would take it off the bill. I handed her my credit card to go ahead and run since everything seemed to take forever there. She brings it back... The manager took $5 off. The Benedict was $13.50. The manager also never even came to the table. I want to hate this place and never return, but I know there is so much potential on that menu. The sad part is the owner was sitting at the table next to usgoing over paperwork.... Oh well."}
{"text":"Overpriced small plates of uninspiring breakfast food except the pancakes which are amazing. Overall just a snooze."}
{"text":"Great place, great atmosphere, great food, and staff is friendly. If you feel like enjoying a good mimosa then head down to snooze."}
{"text":"The location is nice. The restaurant has a neat 70's futuristic look to it. The staff is friendly and very attentive. I appreciated our server's recommendations. I got a half order of chilaquiles Benny and small upside down pineapple pancake. The chilaquiles lacked flavor, but were okay. The pancake was delicious! The boyfriend got the ham Benedict and that was really tasty. I would definitely come here again and try something different."}
{"text":"Let's start out by saying that 5 stars doesn't come close to the type of experience I had at this establishment last week. A friend and I went to Snooze last Sunday morning and I cannot wait to come back for many reasons. Every associate, from beginning to end, was exceptional; everybody had a smile on their face and they were all working very hard. However, there is one associate that I would like to shout out because she changed my entire dining experience and set a standard that not many people can beat, her name is Jessica and she is AMAZING!!! As soon as we sat down, she came up with the biggest smile and a personality that I have never had the pleasure of encountering before. She was unbelievably personable and genuinely cared about her job. I have a lot of food allergies and was not expecting to eat anything other than plain quinoa porridge (which is delicious) but after taking the time to figure out my allergies and what foods I could eat, she went back to the kitchen, personally spoke with the chef and came out with a list of ideas. Not only was I thoroughly impressed by her knowledge of the menu but I was blown away by how determined and sympathetic she was. I mean, this place was slammed and she could've easily been okay with me getting plain quinoa porridge but she went the extra mile to make my experience as best as possible with her. The food was absolutely amazing and came out promptly, so another shout out to the culinary staff. Throughout the rest of our time there, Jessica took amazing care of us and honestly, made us feel like we had known her our whole life. The manager, Ramon (hope I'm spelling it right), was incredible as well! He was so kind and was constantly checking up on us, chatting with us and making us feel right at home. I can only eat at 2 other places in town and now I can joyfully say that Snooze is the third, all thanks to this amazing woman! I'm sure every other associate is amazing there but I cannot wait to go back and sit in her section and her section only! WE LOVE JESSICA!!!!  It was such a pleasure to see and experience this truly amazing staff at Snooze in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Had the most amazing experience here, this will be the new spot. The manager was so great and the food & drinks were excellent. There were so many different things on the menu to try including a lot of healthy options. The breakfast tacos we had was also a must!"}
{"text":"Lower east sider is so simple, fresh, and delicious. their cup of joes are great as well"}
{"text":"I never post, but I have to this time. First time at snooze for me and my wife. We set down and order a coffee & a drink. Then we order our.  The table to the left orders a few minutes after us. The table to the right orders a few minutes after them. We are excited because we have heard that they have some great food. 15 minutes goes by and the table to the left gets there food. About another 5 minutes goes by and the table to the right gets there food. Each table one person order the exact same thing we did ( Duel Benne). No food waiter not in sight. I finally see him and asked him about our food. He then said he will go check. He goes back into the kitchen, he comes out with some food in his hand and goes the opposite way. Then walks back to the kitchen. He walks by our table and does not say anything. After serving some drinks he walks up to us and said our food is next to be cook. At this point it has been 40 minutes. My wife said politely can we just have the check. She gets the check and he said I am sorry. My wife is generous and tips him $3.00 for nothing. The sad think is the waiter did not even try not to make a excuse for the situation. We walk out and will never go back. We then stop at the Waffle House order and got our food in 5 minutes. Now that is service."}
{"text":"Place has an awesome young, trendy vibe that fits perfectly with Tempe's college atmosphere. The food here is great, I definetley reccomend the Sandwhich I Am for any first timers!   Call ahead if you're coming here for brunch, typically there's a 15-20 minute wait. You can play their yard games though while you do wait!"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best breakfast spot in town! Amazing food and great atmosphere! The fact that they have fun brunch drinks is a plus! I have never had a bad meal! Thanks snooze peeps!"}
{"text":"First of all what a cool and relaxed enviorment to walk into. We were  greeted and sat promptlty. The first miss that walked up to the table took our drink order and brought us our drinks as well. Although there was a bit of a gap in between the drinks and the actual server making it to our table everything was a great start.. it was our first time so it gave us a moment to browse the menu and enjoy our coffee!. We all ordered seperate plates of different choices. All were great! To top it off we shared the caramel apple pancakes!!! What a pleasant surprise these were. By far the best pancakes I have ever had!. The meals were great! The price was great! We will with out doubt be back! Good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"The food here had several unique twists on modern breakfast. The brunch cocktails were delicious. I suggest the eggs and bacon cocktail. I would give 5 stars, but one of the dishes showed up later than the others and was cold. We did not have them remake it due to our schedule."}
{"text":"Snooze did a pretty awesome job listening to my last review and responded to not only correct the rude bartender issue by responding and listening to us complaint but gave us a gift card for my husband and I. That definitely changed our mood and their impression. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"`Prices are extremely high.  I was shocked and almost walked out but went ahead and ordered.  The food was good but not special at all.  I do not understand the appeal."}
{"text":"It's only been open a few weeks and I've eaten here twice. Both times food was yummy. Pancakes were heavily. The burrito is gigantic and enough for two people.  The yummy breakfast sandwich on a pretzel bun, with bacon, avocado, and egg is goodness. I love my iced tea and theirs was great. Staff was fun, energetic, happy, helpful. Will be back."}
{"text":"The food looked amazing but I didn't even get as far as a table. The hostess looked at me like I was an idiot just for asking to put my name on the list. I didn't want to be an inconvenience to anyone so we just left."}
{"text":"I really wasn't that impressed. Like one reviewer already mentioned, the selection is primarily eggs. In fact, the menu is primarily eggs in some shape or form whether it be in a burrito, benedict, sandwich or continental style. Only 6 items on the menu besides pancakes and french toast are non egg dishes. I counted because I am allergic to eggs and was searching for something to choose from :( For being a restaurant labeled \"breakfast and BRUNCH\" I would expect at least a few more lunch items like a BLT or Cobb salad. I ended up ordering the Lower East Sider which was a variation on the traditional lox and bagel. It was a deconstructed version and included a sun dried tomato caper relish and herb goat cheese which was quite tasty. However, the $11 charge for the plate was a bit steep considering the small portion. Overall, the food was good but if eggs aren't your thing or if you like the traditional breakfast fare and portion size I would would skip the wait here and go to one of long standing \"brunch\" joints in Gilbert."}
{"text":"We found Snooze back in October in San Diego. After a great breakfast, we told them they needed to open one in Phoenix... lo and behold, it was already in the works! We moved two weeks ago to California, but we had been every Saturday since they opened. Have not had anything I don't like here. The wifey is gluten intolerant so they have gluten free toast and pancakes she loves. It's not on the menu, but ask for the cinnamon roll pancake... just do it. We would get it as an appetizer! Stop reading and try it. It is well worth the 45 min - hour wait."}
{"text":"I can't believe how good this place is, and I can't believe I have never been there until two weeks ago! Good for the soul kind of breakfast, and coffee and drinks that will tickle you on the inside!  I had the gyro bene! Never had anything like that before.With OJ and coffee, oh... my morning was perfect!"}
{"text":"As someone who lives in the area, and hears about this place all the time, I was super excited to try. However, it was underwhelming. The wait was long, the food was overpriced and frankly, it just wasn't that great. I don't get the hype, definitely overrated."}
{"text":"Best place around went to the town & country location and not only did RC give us great service but the food is awesome can't go wrong everything is so good !! Check this place out great atmosphere  as well !!"}
{"text":"You can also have Mexican food for breakfast at Snooze, for those that wish to have exclusively Mexican food while in the Southwest, but the menu is broad and delicious. We ate outside on the patio (although it is a little chilly for some of the locals outside in the morning in February), enjoyed great service. We didn't take advantage of the full bar, but loved that they have it: I had the regular drip decaf coffee, not expecting it to be as robust as I make my own, but was happily surprised: it rocked!  You could even sit at the bar for breakfast, which a number of people were doing.  It is fragrant with breakfast smells and has the hum of a successful enterprise beloved by its patrons."}
{"text":"We met our daughter here for breakfast for the first time since she started attending nearby ASU! Their breakfast menu is loaded with numerous tasty sounding options and with a big mug of great coffee, a patient waitress and such a comfy and fun environment, we took an unusually long time to make our decision! Breakfast came fairly quickly and no one in our mixed group was disappointed! Everything perfectly delicious, very unique and beautifully served!  I ordered the \"pancake of the day\" and a good day it was! Sweet potato pancake with cranberry compote, caramel butter and a drizzle of cream, with a fabulous cranberry syrup! AMAZing!! The casual and chic ambiance, the indescribable selection of amazing and unique menu options available made this an excellent breakfast choice for any occasion or group! I want to try something new, but I'm already craving what I had this morning!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast food and have tried a couple of places around the valley but Snooze is where its at. The food is always fresh and hot when brought to the table. The staff is a hit or miss though. Its always busy but sometimes we get a great server and other times the server is no where to be seen for 10+ minutes."}
{"text":"My Benny Goodman was tasty!!! Have StarChild (bartender) make you an awesome MmmMmm Mimosa. She is super friendly and has great eye makeup!! Thank you for a delicious breakfast and great service."}
{"text":"I had breakfast for the first time here and cannot understand the hype. Food was ok. Not the best breakfast I ever had. It may have been because of the service and the health issue. My friend asked for milk.with her coffee and.water with no ice. The serrver brought cream and water with ice. The server brought.me a refill of my coffee. My friend said 'don't drink it' There was a bright red lipstick stain on the mug.  We told thr server and all.she said was that.doesn't come out in the dishwasher. I told my friend I have lost my.appetite. The food comes. I ordered the corned beef hash and it was ok. I.have had better. I took a bite of my.rye toast and it was dry. Our server was ignoring us so I asked another server for butter. A server brings it  Our server comes over and said I hear you needed more butter. I asked if I was.supposed to have buttered toast. She advised me that there is s machine that does it and they must have forgotten to put my toast in it Again no apology. I live less than 10 minutes from here.Will I be back? Highly unlikely."}
{"text":"Please order the dang Blueberry Lemon (you've gone to heaven) pancakes. Danish... maybe. They are amazing! If my friend was not with me I would have made out with them. Delish!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious food in an adorable retro eatery. I ordered a half order of French toast and half order of eggs Benedict...they best of both worlds! Oh my!!! Thank you to the wonderful waitress that suggested the split and made my breakfast dreams come true. Great coffee and juice as well. A must stop...it doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"My boss took me here for lunch.  The service was fast and friendly.  The food was awesome.  The hash browns freaked me out a bit when they came molded in a little dome shape.  Overall the food was good.  It was really filling.  Unfortunately not enough for leftovers.  Another one of those places I wish was open all day."}
{"text":"As a regular at the Snooze in Denver, I was geeked to see one opening up in Phoenix because I travel here often. Echo and her team hit but out of the park with this one!!!! Excellent food and excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"Zero stars.....  We got there at 7:00AM to beat the rush.  There was no wait time and we got seated instantly. That's where the good ends, we sat there for 10 minutes never got water or even a server to let us know they would be right with us. It wasn't busy and didn't seemed under staffed, the reason I say that is there were plenty of servers just huddled around talking and making eye contact with us. So five minutes later we just walked out.  The couple right next to us were flustered too and were commenting on the bad service.  I now know why there is always long lines at this place. I thought it might have been the food but I guess I'll never know."}
{"text":"This place is the best! It's perfect in every way. Their food is delicious, unique, and fresh every time I have gone. Their staff is super friendly and inviting and prompt. The vibes of this place are great for any occasion, it's really open and has a great atmosphere, they offer beer too which is a plus! The only even remotely bad thing I could say is they are really slow about bringing you iced coffee haha. And you have to park in a parking garage but it is well worth the stop in. It's just as affordable as places like IHOP or Denny's too so why wouldn't you skip them and come here instead? They never mess up a meal either."}
{"text":"So they gave my friend and I a free chocolate chip pancake, for no reason other than, try this! That was nice and great, though I am not a pancake fan at all, I still enjoyed the delicious treat for free. Snooze is ALL the craze and it is in San Diego in both locations there and I am still in awe and curious as to why? Sure it is breakfast and the name is catchy, but what gives to make it worth a 2 hour wait? I do not have a reason, wish I did because I would wait the 2 hours for something spectacular about it but the omelettes are skimpy and the price of 2 pieces of bacon was way too much, it was not a fancy pig or anything. It needs to simply have better food to match it's great service. I recommend sitting at the bar top, always my go-to in crowded places, especially crowded at a place like snooze even at 9am on a Saturday when you think brunch is suppose to have that 2 hour wait at 11am, when many people pull themselves out of bed and lazily approach a good ole saturday."}
{"text":"Great place for a very tasty but unique breakfast.  I enjoyed it thoroughly!"}
{"text":"I blame snooze for making every meal I ate after theirs seem  ho hum. The flavor of the meal was amazing as was the service, thanks for a great meal. I had the Benny goodman and a traditional eggs Benedict. We are going to bookend our trip with another bite from the \"snooze\" before flying back to Sitka, Alaska."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for breakfast based on past Yelp reviews. The food was delicious and didn't too long to come out of the kitchen. The disappointing thing was that the service we experienced was bad, it took a while for them to acknowledge us, the server couldn't answer simple questions about the menu, and didn't come by to check on our table to refill drinks and make sure that we were ok."}
{"text":"Best selection of pancakes in the Valley.  The breakfast cocktails are not to be overlooked, great bloody mary and mimosa selection."}
{"text":"Cooper, my rescue chihuahua, and I are always looking for great food where he and I can go together. This place is perfect!  The food was great. I had the French toast and a cup of coffee and he had the bacon.   I love the attention to detail in the ingredients that is obvious in the quality of the food.   And all the employees were super nice to Cooper. They made both of us feel very welcome.  We will be back here so I can try other dishes and bring some of my other furkids!"}
{"text":"Always great service, super accommodating to food allergies!  Weekends there is always a wait, so we usually go on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Heaven....I can't wait to go back. Best breakfast I've had in years. My almond milk chai latte was amazing!!  The food was fabulously creative.  Servers were awesome and patient. And they play music that you would not expect which really adds to the fun.  Did I mention you can stare at Nordstroms Rack while you wait...like I said Heaven ^-^"}
{"text":"I'm convinced many of the reviewers were either too hungry to care about the food, or still sleeping, because I am baffled at how this place compares to anything beyond The Waffle House.  The only things worth complimenting was the very nice server. And the eggs. I ordered mine over easy and they were perfect.  And that's about it folks. Downhill from there! The hash browns are mealy and under seasoned, the chicken sausage is a haphazardly shaped disk made with ground chicken and overly used sausage seasoning, the coffee is no different than what you get in a drive thru, and the French toast is similar to what your mom makes...just bigger...and embellished with random sauces.   If you think that's worth waiting and paying for--have at it.  An alternative is just make your own meal. If you want to feel like you're at Snooze, just wait 2 hours before serving yourself."}
{"text":"Went an a Sunday at 10:30am We had a large group (10) people, so it took over an hour to seat us.  I expected this, so not a negative, just providing some insight. They seated half our group, then the other half about 10 minutes later.  Complimentary coffee while waiting is nice and the option to order a Bloody Mary or Mimosa, also a plus. I consider most breakfast joints very similar, so I'll go over the highlights  of this new venture:  Host and other staff were friendly.  Manager type person seating a couple at the counter where I was waiting on a couple of Blood Mary cocktails, not so friendly.  They could add a sign at the end of counter that says \"walk up drink orders\" and probably help out everyone. Breakfast cocktail selection was very good as well.  We tried the Gazpacho Bloody with pepper vodka and it was very tasty. Great and varied menu.  Creative offerings and the food itself was very good! We tried a number of things. The highlights included the Pancake flight, allowing you to mix and match three different pancakes.  Breakfast Pot Pie was delicious and filling.  They also had some tasty options for our non carnivore friend as well.  Regarding the comment about no paper towels in the bathroom.  The faucet has a built in Dyson Blade air hand dryer.  The only downside is if you are not familiar with this device you would benefit from reading the \"how-to\" they have posted right next to the sink.  Although I can certainly empathize that the last thing one might want to do on a Sunday morning breakfast is have to read instructions on how to dry one's hands! :)  All and all, good experience, great food.  Would I go back?  Yes."}
{"text":"We go here every other weekend and every time they service is awesome! Staff is friendly and the food is always on point! The Benny's are the best!!! Wait time is worth it and the complimentary coffee is just a added bonus."}
{"text":"Disappointing wait time. Then we were paged to be seated and were required to stand there and wait watching our empty table wait for us for 5 minutes but they kindly informed us we could play with the dirty toys that have NEVER been washed outside....wait we just did that for 45 minutes!    OMG avoid the OMG French toast because the OMG you are expecting is more like OMG they just cut one large piece of bread into 4 pieces and OMG charge $10 and OMG I am going die of starvation.   Don't come thirsty either...waiting for a refill will take an entire meal. Perhaps because the concept of busboys is left to the servers and the hostess that is more than eager to pull your plate with food still on it!  Looking forward to the new locations in Tempe and Gilbert because this location leaves a lot to be desired. Hopefully the new places are arranged to handle the crowds with comfortable seating and staff trained to serve and move food, drinks and people. Otherwise they will be hearing from me there as well"}
{"text":"The b.e.l.t. Is amazing! I added avocado and it was to die for! The Dijon mustard aioli made the sandwich. $5 for beer pitchers and wine by the glass, an awesome deal. Definitely recommend for brunch"}
{"text":"Heard this place had a best French Toast so I've ordered Just a French Toast Neat with a pouched egg and sausages on the side. The food would have tasted better if they were served hot. I've saw more employees than the customers but still my food was served cold. So disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, our server was prompt and friendly. I ordered the Ruben and it was great! Pretzel bun was nice and soft, not too chewy like I thought it would be. Ordered the Spicy Bloody Mary and it was excellent."}
{"text":"I enjoyed breakfast here with a friend. Very cute interior and fun vibe. I was a little disappointed with my French toast but everything else was excellent! I will be back and have to try some of their other dishes. The hash browns looked phenomenal."}
{"text":"What a great place. We had 11 in our party and everyone loved their food. They have lots of unique menu items and all are worth trying. Our families favorite breakfast place, too bad it is 2000 miles away."}
{"text":"Every time I go, I am always pleased. Delicious food, great service."}
{"text":"Love snooze. I'd eat here every morning if I could. They take great care of their guest, I've even gotten a few pancakes on the house. I come into snooze a lot and I'd like to shoutout the server Steven as I've had him a lot over the last few months and he rocks. Also had a guy who went by merman this morning and he was super cool and attentive as well!! But overall never had a bad experience!!"}
{"text":"If the wait is going to be an hour... they should tell you it is going to be an hour! My girlfriend and I got together Saturday morning and decided to try Snooze for the first time since we had both previously gone with our husbands but declined to wait on the very long line.  We went early in hopes of avoiding a long wait.  When we arrived, it was busy, but not crazy.  There were several open tables and we thought the line would move quickly.  When we put our name on the list we were advised it would be a 25-35 minute wait.  Ok, not too bad. We opted for \"first available\" seating as it was still early and cool enough outside. After about 50 minutes, I approached the hostess to check on our time.  She acknowledged that we were past our stated wait time and said \"Oh, I'm sorry, that was my fault, but there are still 4 people ahead of you.\"  About 15 minutes later we were told they had a table available but it was outside.  Well, now that over an hour had gone by, it had heated up nicely and we no longer wanted to sit outside.  They told us they would seat us at the next available indoor table.  We watched 2 other groups get seated inside before they remembered about us. (Sigh)  Once seated it took several minutes for anyone to show up for our drink orders or to go over the menu and specials.  On a high-note ~ I love that the food is farm fresh/organic. I opted to try the sweet potato pancake with my eggs and it was unlike any other pancake I have ever had.  Absolutely delicious!!  My friend had that day's Special, which was a lemon curd/marscapone cream, white chocolate chip pancake concoction, that she also thoroughly enjoyed.  If the service was as good as the food, I would have given 5 stars.  Unfortunately, the long wait and slow service definitely put a damper on our Snooze experience and our morning. ;("}
{"text":"So no matter what you have to wait to get a table. I knew that going in. BUT they told me the wait would be 35 min. After 50 minutes I got a text saying we'll be getting a table soon. Time keeps going by and it turns into another 30 minutes. I go up and ask what time are table will be next and they tell me someone took me off the wait list! I was next to the host table the whole time. The host team didn't seem to care. I got the next table after another 10 minutes. The food was ok, but I'm not going back after that horrible experience. What a waste of my Sunday morning!!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty fabulous!  I had the OMG French toast and they really were OMG delicious.  The waitress wasn't particularly friendly or attentive but if all the food is this good, it doesn't matter to me."}
{"text":"Food was a 4, but the service from Teasha was a little bit sideways (literally) she did not walk past the corner of the table.  I don't think she smiled once.  We were sbout to leave based on her bad attitude.  The gentleman that brought our food was more attentive than Teasha was.  So a bit of advice, if she comes to your table, leave or ask to be seated in another servers section, trust me.."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was great, Charles was very informative and patient with us since this was our first time here. The table next to us was a bit obnoxious complaining the whole time they were here about pretty much nothing. But overall it was a great experience! I will be back! Samoa cookie pancakes for the win!"}
{"text":"My heart was broken. Still bleeding, I found myself on a seven day sojourn in Denver. Looking to get lost for a while. Looking for a tourniquet. It was that trip, and the encouragement of a dear friend that opened my eyes to the beautifully unexpected marvel that is SNOOZE. I didn't know then that that experience would change my life, but what I did know was that the OMG French Toast, friendly faces, prompt service, and gallon of coffee were exactly what I needed after a loooong night trying to un-torture my past. I wandered aimlessly through the great city the next 6 days. I was a sponge. The gentle hum, the drugs, the fairer sex, the wind, steel butting against rock, all of it. Soaked it all in. They say the sponge has no nervous, digestive, or circulatory systems. I could relate that week. However, in a seven day stretch of desolate whimsy with no clear direction, I found one constant. SNOOZE. Sweet, savory, and made with pride. A game changer in the world of breakfast.     I returned home to Chicago. The scar was slow to heal, but my life would go on. Good days, bad days, days so uninspiring you can't even classify them, whatever. A rut was developing. I needed something new.     I settled in Scottsdale, AZ. I have no idea why, but here I was and I  found some fast friends. After what can only be described as one of the more epic nights in recorded drunken history a friend suggested we work off our hangovers at Snooze.     Wait....  What?  There's a Snooze here?  Are you fu**ing with me?   She was not. Once Google confirmed her story to be true, I ran out of the house as if it was on fire. I drove down to Tempe. Alone. I wanted this experience for myself. The whole 15 minute trip I fantasized about breakfast burritos, Bennys, pancakes, Micheladas, EVERYTHING! The car was floating. I was floating. I was about to be reunited with an old friend I thought I would only ever see in the city of Denver. I didn't want to pinch myself for fear of waking up.     I walked in. It was different. Not in a bad way. Just different. More open, airy, better lighting, a lot of Dr. Dog on the stereo. The smells were the same. The smiles were bigger. I liked it immediately. I sat down at the bar. Continuing to look around and soak it all in. I was a sponge again and all of the emotions of my lost week in Denver flooded back into my brain. There was pain, but there was more excitement. I was ready. I knew what I wanted.    This is when my life changed. Forever.   I haven't been to all of the Snooze's in the country, but I don't have to visit them all to tell you that Snooze Tempe has something the rest of them don't. Her name is Parker. The wild card. She's an X-factor the other locations could only dream of having. Shortly after sitting down she was right in front of me. I ordered coffee, and then it goes blank. I was lost. More like trapped. Trapped in the beautiful abyss of her eyes. I bet a thousand men have been told what the pancake of the day is, yet never truly heard the words coming out of her mouth. I gathered myself and continued to look around. Soaking everything in. I was studying the food of everyone around me, watching the staff interact, listening to the stories being told of last night. I never wanted it to end. It was pure magic, and in the center of it all was Parker and her smile that could make the world stop. I ate, we laughed, the music played, and eventually like all things do, it ended. I may never see Parker again, or eat the delicious tacos or pancakes at Snooze, but the beauty and warmth felt that morning changed me. Reinvigorated me. A meal at Snooze is not just a meal. It's an experience. I now realize that's what dragged me back there every morning in Denver, and will most likely make me return to SNOOZE TEMPE a lot more in the future.   Thank you Parker, and thank you Snooze. You woke something inside of me, and for that I'm eternally grateful."}
{"text":"Came here for my daughters 5th Bday because it's what she wanted, big mistake the wait was supposed to be one hour. It turned out to be 1 hr and forty minutes and the food came out at different times, not to mention that the waitress had a bad attitude. I love the food but the customer service and waiting is not worth the headache and frustration.  Highly recommend them taking reservations to place more focus on the food vice wait time and bad service. #iwillnevercomebackagain"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast locale in the East Valley. The food is fresh and high quality, and they offer a large variety of menu items. In addition, they are one of the few restaurants to offer stevia packets at the tables instead of just sugar and sweet & low...great for those who want more natural/healthy options to choose from. If I had to pick a negative, it would be their long wait times on the weekends, but that only speaks to how good they are, and how many people want to eat there."}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast joint!  Love the food quality, service, and ambiance.  It's just upbeat and fun.  I've never been let down, and my meal is always on point.  I'm a regular at getting a delicious omelette filled with lots of yummies, my husband loves the breakfast pot pie.  Their spicy Bloody Mary's are amazing!!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I would like to preface with the fact that I have really never left a bad review as bad as the one I'm about to give. I worked in the food industry and I get the whole being short staffed super busy on a Sunday morning thing, I really truly do. However...  Snooze is Over-hyped, understaffed, unappreciative of its customers. This \"80's themed\" breakfast joint seemed like a perfect hip place to have a family breakfast this morning, and especially so for my sister's last meal with us before she moved out of state. Boy, were we fooled!   Upon our arrival I had my two year old son, my sister and her boyfriend, my parents, and my grandmother. We def anticipated a 45 minute wait so when we approached the hostess stand we were very content at being quoted 45 minutes. Not too bad for downtown Gilbert on Sunday morning. 65 MINUTES LATER I had to approach the hostess stand and ask how much longer of a wait we were going to have. \"You have three more large groups ahead of you, so maybe 10-15 minutes.\" (70/75 minute wait total) This was after my whole family sat outside sweating our asses off. Here's a hint Snooze Owner, we live in Arizona, not sure if you've either A. EVER been here, or B. Lived through an Arizona summer, but it's pretty standard to have misters, fans, SOMETHING. It's great that you offer water and hot coffee but let's be real, ICED coffee would have been more satisfying to your customers, and COLD water, not pipe temperature luke warm water that really doesn't cool your internal temp down. Now, I do understand that there is availability to stand inside but it's so packed in the lobby area (which isn't a lobby) that you can't really stand comfortably, especially with a two year old and about 40 other hot, sweaty bodies.   Finally the hostess is ready to seat us, oh and let me say that I had approached the stand about three times after our given wait time and the hostess taking names never remembered who I was. It's called \"surprise and delight\" to which this woman did not. Hire suggestion, find someone who's younger and mature enough to put a little pep into their voice. I mean really Snooze? You're a multi-location breakfast joint. Breakfast is the pivotal moment in everyone's morning and from the look and sound of almost all the customers around me you ruined that for a lot of people today.  Upon being seated we sit at a table closer to the door so we have feel a breeze because we were seated outside where there were again NO fans or misters. After everyone sits down and begins to settle at the table some other, either hostess or kitchen staff member comes over to the table and tells us this table is for another party and we need to move over to the other table. It would have been one thing if she had asked us kindly, but she was pretty rude about it and didn't apologize. So, my family gets up and moves over to a table sitting in the sun. The waitress who ends up coming over to serve us is THE ONLY ONE who apologized, showed any enthusiasm, and was kind. She helped us move the table more into the shade and grabbed a high chair for us. If it wasn't for her I'd be giving a one star review. She was prompt about getting our order in and very understanding that we were starving and sweaty. It took her a bit of time to bring us ice water (she even brought a kids cup for my son) but she came to the table and explained she wanted to ensure a timely delivery of our food. May I also say that this waitress had been outside serving people all morning long who have also been cranky and irritated at their entire experience thus far and she truly upheld the moral part of running a restaurant. Serving good food to good people.   For the price the food costs I expected better. The food was good no less, but it wasn't any better than the Good Egg down the street who has a shorter wait, happier staff, and indoor only seating during the summer. I ordered my son french toast which had good flavor and syrup, but the bread was a little dry and lacked a little in texture. The hashbrowns were great. They came very close to beating Beth's Cafe in Seattle WA, which has been a 5 year mission of mine. My dad ordered a simple eggs benedict sandwich which did not have a good portion of hollandaise sauce and fell short. Everyone else seemed fairly happy with their food and as was I. However, like I said it did not live up to the hype or my expectations (which were not set high at any point), not just because the service (minus our waitress) was the worst ever, but because Snooze has expanded too quick & too soon. The recipes should be revisited and refocused. The interiors were fun & simple, however like I've said; it's Arizona don't have outdoor seating during the summer, it's a different story when the high is 80 degrees.   Overall, there is significant room for improvement. Owner of Gilbert Snooze, if you would like more feedback, I'm more than happy to give some so you can create a more positive experience for everyone."}
{"text":"Great service! Even offered a sling for my baby's car seat which was awesome!  We ordered the corned beef hash! Which looked and tasted great!  Would recommend this place to everyone. Although don't come here on a Saturday for brunch it's very very busy!"}
{"text":"Vegans and vegetarians, steer clear of this joint. I was excited to show my boyfriend this breakfast place that is vegan friendly, after going to the Gilbert location and having a wonderful experience. Service here was slow and food came out luke warm, despite being one of the few tables that had customers. My soyrizo tacos were baren, my boyfriend's hash browns were sad. The worst part; we found a piece of PORK(?) in his TOFU scramble? We showed the waitress, who walked away and avoided the issue entirely. Why have tofu and soy products of your going to just cook it where meat, and meat grease is? Disgusting. I definitely won't be going back. I don't understand how this place has so many good reviews while reading what horrible service and bland food is here."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service that I have received from a general manager before. It was pathetic and ruined my Sunday morning. Checked in for two letting them know we have a dog so we need the patio. After waiting for an hour we are sat at a two top right in the middle of the patio. No room for our dog as the pathway was maybe two feet wide so the whole time we would be eating she would be in the way of servers and patrons. Asked if we could move to either of the open tables and she was not willing to move us because she had a \"list\" to go by. We were just on that \"list\" and were at the top of it so you should make sure that we were priority. Total disregard for us your customer who has made snooze a frequent stop. Not anymore, you have forever lost our business and i will make sure to spread the word about. After being in the service industry for over 8 years, I know what needs to be done to satisfy your customers and you did everything but that. Don't be a dog friendly patio if you are not willing to do anything and accommodate your guest."}
{"text":"I think this place is more trendy then delicious. I was disappointed in the quality of ingredients as they advertise as being healthy.  Does their food taste great? YES!  But it's because it's fatty, greasy, and sugary (their pancakes will give you a heart attack!)"}
{"text":"It's weird that you have to check in even for the bar....but it's helpful because it's so popular that it's hard even to get a bar seat. So far everyone has a great attitude and ate very friendly. Very tasty mimosa's. ..cheers!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent food and excellent service... the only thing.. waiting sometimes is just insane! 2 or 3 hours! I guess is so good and popular that they can't keep up with so many people arriving"}
{"text":"Delicious and great service.  You must try the pineapple pancakes. Went on Tuesday just after 830 am no wait."}
{"text":"I've visited this location several times - there is a wait for a reason. The staff is friendly and smiling, the food is amazing, the price is spot on. I would highly recommend. Props to Olivia - she was funny, patient, informative (recommendations), generous - brought out a side cake for a special occasion. Love this place and well worth the wait. My favorites are the Cinnamon Roll pancakes, Egg White Frittata, Bella! Bella! Benny - Great job, Great place"}
{"text":"My experience at Snooze was vastly different that my breakfast the prior day. That place wasn't bad, just over hyped. It did gave me a 'C' baseline to compare. The snooze decor is, 'up beat' in a late 60's space Era, Tupperware colors kind of way. I liked it. Service was great. Lyle was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and gave us a complimentary pancake to sample. It was whiskey, maple, white chocolate chip something. Damn awesome is what it was. My wife and I snacked part of it down as an appetizer and the rest as dessert. I love the fact they let you mix and match both pancakes and Benedict items. I couldn't decide between the Steak or Chile Verde Benedict so I got one of each. They were both excellent. My wife got the shrimp and grits special and it was also very good. There is pet friendly outdoor seating which is always a good thing whether you prefer to dine near or far from our 4 legged pals. Strongly suggest you give them a try."}
{"text":"My favorite snooze location. Always great food and chill environment. Sit at the bar and enjoy a mmmmisoa and have some breakfast tacos!"}
{"text":"Went today and the food originally came out cold. After a ~5 minute wait for the waitress she brought the food back to be remade without an apology. Food was brought back hot but a majority was flavorless and unseasoned, and eggs were slathered in cooking oil on the bottom. Manager was polite and lowered the cost of the bill by a decent amount but overall the hassle was not worth it. The restaurant looks nice but the food and especially the customer service need to be improved."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere with great food! The stuffed French toast was delicious!  Omelette was good with lots to choose from."}
{"text":"Management should look into retraining whoever was hosting today. She must have not been on top of her game.. will probably go to the Ray or ASU one from here on out."}
{"text":"It is okay.....I can't figure out why everyone is so hyped about this place. They do have a friendly staff! I have been here twice. The pancake and big burrito was nothing special at all. The cost of burrito was fine $10 but disappointing. The beans tasted like they expired or were from a can. It didn't taste fresh and left overs it tasted worse. For a long wait I think Snooze should offer a small basket of  French toast stick and syrup when a table is seated. Or something that does not cost the company much. Great way to stick out from other competitors that are down the street."}
{"text":"This place is very popular. I have to admit i don't get it. It isn't bad, it just wasn't that good. I had the lox plate. The salmon was nice as was the bread, a dark pumpernickel type. The sides of capers, onion and tomato were made into a sweetish relish which did not go well with the lox. The greens were fesh, a large undressed mound and the egg was a halved boiled egg not chopped.  One companion had an omelet which seemed to be the best choice. Another had the quinoa porredge, not a huge hit. The service was fast, friendly and informed."}
{"text":"I think this was one of my top five breakfast places ever.  I stopped in right after they opened (7am) on a Sunday morning, and sat by myself at the counter. I ordered a flight: one pineapple upside down pancake, one sweet potato pancake, and one order of OMG french toast. I also had an order of hash browns.  The meal was one of the best I have ever had for breakfast. Every bit of food was like an explosion of bliss. I am sure that if I knew the calorie count, I'd be a little less enthusiastic. But let's not talk about that! I am usually of the opinion that most breakfast places are pretty much the same: eggs are eggs, and pancakes are pancakes, right? Wrong. Here, things are different, and they are a-MAY-zing.  I don't have a single thing to criticize about Snooze. Even the prices are great (my meal was less than $15 total)! The coffee is organically sourced from Guatemala, and it is also excellent!  In reading some of the other reviews, it appears that it can get pretty crowded, with long waits later in the day. If you get there right when they open, that is probably your best bet. So do yourself a favor: get up early, eat a huge and amazing meal, and then work out later in the day. It will all be worth it!"}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place! Love all  the different kinds of pancakes and eggs Benedict. A little too noisy when you sit inside, you have to yell to talk to the people at your table, but outside seating is great. There are games on the back patio while you are waiting to be seated or waiting for your food. They also allow dogs on the patio!"}
{"text":"A friend told us about this place so we drove up.  Sunday brunch the place was packed but we were seated within 30 min which was good. Service was great. Food was fantastic. My husband had the potpie and I had chilli verde eggs Benedict.   There were no leftovers that's for sure."}
{"text":"We came after school let out for the semester and were told we came at a good time. Great atmosphere as it's cozy.  The food selection was great and they has different twists to the food. The Benny Goodman and the Snooze Classic were amazing and very filling.  If you haven't been here,  it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Limited fountain drink options, seemed to skimp a bit on the hollandaise for the traditional eggs Benedict, eggshell in the eggs, music too loud, and the waiter didn't seem concerned about why we barely touched our food. Not worth the time or the money.  I highly doubt I will ever return or recommend this place. Don't know what people see in it."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful brunch!! Fun place and a great selection to choose from. The only problem was we couldn't decide!!  Waffles delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Not my favorite breakfast place, but top 5 for sure. Try the open face breakfast pot pie or the pancakes!"}
{"text":"I came here the day it opened at around 8:00 am, and I loved the ambience!  The service was great, as well. I ordered the O.M.G. French toast, which was out of this world!  I was afraid it would be too sweet, with the mascarpone and salted caramel sauce, but there was just a little of each, so it was perfect.  I love the patio in the back, and the fact that you can play cornhole and ping pong.  I had been to the Tempe location several times, so I was excited that one was opening right by my house.  I love everything that I've ever ordered at Snooze.  It does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Best ham Benedict I've ever had.  I also like that they provide coffee for you when you're waiting for a table.  Get there early to avoid a long wait."}
{"text":"Just visited Snooze for the first time today with my work team for breakfast. I would say that the atmosphere, food, and friendliness of the staff is super! But, we sat outside and there are no fans or misters. We asked if they had anything they can turn on ( because we are all hot and sweaty), and they said they like to preserve energy so they do not have either.  In Arizona, when it is 100 degrees by 9am and you offer outdoor seating, I think you should offer misters or fans. I understand and appreciate the thought of preserving energy and water, but when you are only open till mid afternoon, you wont have to run them as long as other businesses that are open all day long and can still be energy efficient.  We were all dripping sweat by the time breakfast was over. The food was good, and I will be back, but i will try to sit inside next time if the wait isnt too long. Glad they opened Snooze here in Gilbert. Gilbert is where it's at!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in AZ! Phenomenal service, everyone is happy to be there, delicious food, seriously there are no better pancakes in the world, I'm convinced!   Make sure to ask what the pancake of the day is! Oh and sinful pancake (not on the menu) is my absolute fav. It's like a cinnamon roll pancake with bacon bits on top. Yum, so good! Oh and so many mimosa options. If you like to brunch so hard, you will find no better place. :)"}
{"text":"Generally I try to stick to local spots when I eat out, but snooze is a breakfast joint and I love breakfast. Anyway, my first time there the waitstaff was having a competition to see who could drink the most bloody Mary's on shift; my group found this hilarious and the feeling in the restaurant was fun and professional. The food was 4/5 stars, the service was great, the prices were kind of high, and I will definitely go back. Oh! Also, they allow pets on the patio which is great for my dog -- he loves it! There are better local spots, but you probably won't be too disappointed here either way."}
{"text":"Great place to go!! Came here for my daughters birthday! Service was awesome! Wait was totally worth it! Coming back!"}
{"text":"Food always tastes so yummy and service is always on point! Little bit of a wait to get in but was so worth it ! Try the tomato soup and grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks are great. Everything else is not.   Today we were told the wait would be 35-50 minutes. Over an hour later got seated. While waiting we had a single seat at the bar and two bartenders gave us shit about taking up the seat and not ordering food even though we get drinks every time. I guess one of us should eat standing and be uncomfortable the whole time...   Also the music is terrible. Whitney Houston and Katy perry non stop....   Once seated things got a little better. But every time we're there the waitress brings the check before we are done eating and never asks if we want anything else. Was going to order a coffee but seemed like we were getting kicked out.   May go back for the food, but the service/ attitude is terrible."}
{"text":"Almost always a wait because this place is so damn good. I got the Benny Goodman, a different take on eggs benedict. Folks I was with got eggs and or pancakes (the sweet potato and buttermilk pancakes were the best. Service is friendly and no too solicitous. Closes at 2:30 on Sunday. Oh, and Snooze has a bar for those of us who enjoy a bloody mary, mimosa, or bellini with our breakfast."}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious food! Charles gave A++ service. Got the snooze classic and the French toast neat and both were so good!"}
{"text":"Been in AZ for 5 days and have been here twice. The service is awesome. We did experience a little hiccup the second visit but Echo the \"Peacemaker\"  and our waitress Dre stepped up and ended our experience and meal with smiles and class. Worth the wait.  Food and service get 5 stars. Thank you."}
{"text":"We went 2 days in a row the first day we went in the afternoon, I got loaded hash browns with green chile sauce (medium spice level) and sausage, he got a duo of eggs benedict one benny goodman and one ham benedict III no complaints and since it was so late we had our run of the place.  We enjoyed it so much we went again today this time in the morning.  I had corned beef hash without the egg and I think it needed something in place of the egg it just didn't feel complete, I opted to switch my toast for a blueberry danish pancake if I had any complaints it would be that there was to little of the lemon cream cheese.  He had another benedict duo this time he had the Bella! Bella! Benny and the caprese benny the hash was cooked to a golden perfection and both of us cleaned our plates. The service was great the atmosphere was great and the place was packed to the point where we had to sit at the high top seating or wait for a table, we opted to sit by the window which was a great view but the vents face directly at this stretch of seating so it's chilly and windy, next time I'd probably sit at the bar instead. All in all great food, service,  experience I'm sure we'll go back the next time we're in phoenix."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! My husband and I go every other Saturday after the farmers market. Every dish we have tried, which is almost everything, is delicious! It's also a plus for me that a lot of the food is obtained locally, they list the places they get everything from directly on their menu which is really cool. I personally love the eggs Benedict creations they have, Chilequilles Benedict is my fave and the coffee is really good too. Also have really great cocktails if your feeling like day drinking ;)! I 100% recommend this place and take my friends and family whenever I get the chance!"}
{"text":"First time here a couple weekends ago, but the dish I got (shrimp & grits) was soooo good. Also tried a blueberry pancake, which was very delicious. There were too many other tempting menu choices to not return..."}
{"text":"Well, I honestly wish I knew what was wrong with CS these days. It just seems bad everywhere.   My wife and daughter attempted to eat here this morning before work. We walked in and waited to be seated. Mind you, the place was barely a quarter full. So it's not like employees were running around like the place was at capacity.   It didn't take too long to get greater but it wasn't as fast as it normally takes when I frequent other restaurants. The gentleman was engaging and pleasant though, so no big deal I thought.   We were seated in plain view. It's not like they hid is away in the corner. A couple of minutes go by and no one comes to bring water and ask what we wanted to drink.   Meanwhile I see a waitress milling about by the kitchen and another girl cleaning up in the bar style seating area.   Another couple of minutes goes by and my wife sees the waitress great and start to take the drink orders of three women who were seated after us.   Well, we didn't have time due to work so we got up and left. As we left I mentioned they needed to work on their CS. The waitress looked at me with this \"duuuuhhh, huh?\" Look.  Total deer in headlights.   I'm dumbfounded. This seems like it's more and more common. Don't these people understand cleaning and rearranging and that stuff comes second to customers who are waiting?  You're there because if the customer, period. That's where the money comes from.   Nothing pisses me off more when I see employees rushing around cleaning up and doing their closing routine to \"get out on time\" when customers are there waiting on them.   I mean, even if there was a mix up no one noticed we were sitting there with no drinks. Isn't that a hint we haven't been heated by a server and to find out why?  I guess not. What do I know lol.   Anyway, I use to think the long lines on the weekends was due to great food. Now I'm guessing it's due to the lax attitude of the wait staff.   I'll wait for good food. That's ok. I won't wait because employees think milling around and piddling around with nonsense is more important than serving people. Seems like the norm nowadays."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved Snooze! The food was delicious and they were completely accommodating to my husbands allergy to gluten. I would highly recommend this great breakfast place in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"It is great but unless you want to wait 30 minutes and experience slow service and top-volume noise avoid it on weekend mornings (we've eaten at other area breakfast places with quieter atmosphere). The food is amazing and the servers friendly, though this morning the person who brought out the plates to us and our neighbors was surly, to put it mildly. We also got to enjoy the guy next to us telling his friends about his Aryan nation activities (gosh wonder what it would have been like if we'd had our biracial son along). That was unfortunate but part of the crowd bargain. Next time we'll stick to weekdays."}
{"text":"So so so good! Best breakfast with a fun environment in Tempe. We have been there multiple times and enjoy it every time. Always enjoy there pancake flights :) so yummy!  There is a long wait if you go on the weekends so plan ahead for that.  Service is always nice and friendly. The even gave us free pancakes once :)"}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with Snooze! I've tried their restaurants in San Diego (Hillcrest and Del Mar) as well as Phoenix (Tempe). Damn good food and great staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Five stars for Snooze!! I've been here a few times and food is always consistent. I've gotten the salmon Benedict's before & the Benedict's with prosciutto and arugula. Yummmm! I love their mimosas, you can choose many different flavored juice to go with the champagne, and they come in a nice, tall glass. Bloody Mary's are good too.   Five stars for our server, Olivia! She was so sweet and attentive. I love when you can tell someone is genuinely happy and enjoying their job.   Snooze gets BUSY, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, glad I did. The wait staff here looks to be having fun. They take the time to make you feel you are special. I have the cornbread hash liked it a lot. I'll be back when in the area again."}
{"text":"love this place. go there once a week at least. omg French toast is amazing. I've never had an eggs Benny i didn't love!"}
{"text":"A new weekend date spot for my husband and myself. They can make anything delicious. I can't wait until Saturday, as a matter of fact. I'm glad we stumbled on this little gem."}
{"text":"OMG, the pancake flights are the best! You can get a savory pancake and combine with some sweeter versions for a real treat. Sweet Potato pancake is a favorite.  The staff is amazing and it's one of the few places where you can get almond milk for your coffee. I don't know why more breakfast places don't offer non-milk products for those of us who don't like our coffee black, but can't drink milk. The only drawback is that it is so popular that there's usually a wait. The patio seating is great with tables under the trees and there's also beanbag tossing and ping pong out on the patio. Fun and Hip place with a great decor and great vibe."}
{"text":"Bomb is all I can say. The food was really fresh and the server was very attentive. I will definitely come here for breakfast again."}
{"text":"Waited an hour yesterday for a good breakfast...not great by any standard and certainly not worth the wait.  We agreed that if we go back and if there's a wait more than 10 minutes, we'll walk down to Liberty Market or Farmhouse for a better dining experience.  My wife had the corned beef hash and I had the reuben sandwich, both of which were OK but nothing special at all.  The staff was extremely friendly and the atmosphere inside is loud, so be prepared for really good service, pretty good food and lots of noise."}
{"text":"I didn't use any salt, pepper or hot sauce on anything, it was all that delicious. With their intriguing and diverse menu, not to mention the paradoxical vintage yet modern ambiance, I'll be eating at Snooze a lot more often."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place is AWESOME! First of all the decor is retro and 80's music is playing which is fun and really puts you in a good mood in the morning. Our server, Corey, was really cool and offers great suggestions. The food was nothing short of amazing, just as good as your grandmother's cooking. This place is the BOMB!"}
{"text":"Let's be real for moment.. This spot has the best benny's in Phoenix. I haven't been to any of the other locations, but if they're as good as this one (camelback), you can't go wrong. The staff is incredibly friendly, and ALL the food is legit."}
{"text":"I've been to Snooze a few times and it's always been a fantastic experience. There's usually a pretty long wait but it's absolutely worth it.  I definitely recommend putting your name on the wait list well before the morning hunger pangs kick in!  The upside to the long wait is that they will send a text when your table is almost ready so you don't have to hang around outside in the crazy AZ heat.  Head down the street to a coffee shop or do a little shopping next door while you wait. No more waiting in a designated perimeter with a pager! Freeeeedom!  The menu is perfect for brunch seekers with adult beverages like the Morning Manhattan,   Bangkok Bloody Mary or the Pineapple Mimosa. My favorite food item is Juan's Breakfast Tacos and their selection of Eggs Benedict is pretty wicked. I've brought both friends and family here and everyone has fallen in love with this place as the food is amazing and the retro 60s vibe offers something unique to the typical brunch experience. Snooze offers a refreshing take on some of the traditional brunch items and you truly get a sense that they put great thought and effort into their menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. The tacos are amazing and the easy access coffee is great. Games to play out back and the little bar out front is perfect. My only issue is the long wait. Generally, it's 45-60 mins so we eat something on the way there. Haha. I have yet to have anything bad on their menu, but you can't go wrong with those tacos..."}
{"text":"This will be my new favorite place to go for a great breakfast. Atmosphere is bright and floor plan doesn't leave you feeling cramped. The staff is amazing as well; friendly and attentive. The food is AMAZING, I had the Eggs Benedict with a mimosa; both were great. Best Eggs Benedict in town!! When I was carded for the mimosa our waitress noticed that it was my birthday and brought me a birthday pancake (with a single lit candle :) ) which was a surprise because I hadn't mentioned it to her. It made my day plus the pancake which I believe was drizzled in caramel and pecans was delicious. It was my first time eating here and by far the best experience at a new restaurant. Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"Definitely gets crowded on Sunday morning. Get there early and you'll be happy. We did a flight of pancakes and French toast which isn't explicitly on the menu. Really good."}
{"text":"Delicious. I'm a lover of breakfast and they do it right. Good portion size, great variety, vegan/vegetarian options and they always ask if I was the rest of my coffee to go as I'm signing my check! Just love the idea of that."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite breakfast/brunch place. Every Sunday my wife and I are here and we've tried everything on the menu. You can't go wrong. The drinks are great. Service is great and food is delicious. You won't be upset if you come!"}
{"text":"Really love Snooze! This was my third time and each time has been a different location (Houston, Scottsdale and now here). I've loved them all!   I've tried the sweet potato and blueberry pancakes and both are outstanding.  Service is friendly and efficient although there can be a wait.    I love that they really let you be creative with the menu and make your breakfast your own.  Seems like they'll do just about any substitutions you want!    The kids menu is great- a decent size pancake, fruit cup, hash browns and juice or milk for $6. My daughter loves it.    Today I tried two different types of eggs Benedict- one was classic and one Italian although I forget the names.  Both were delicious."}
{"text":"I have been to Snooze/Phoenix three times and each time the service has been poor.  The food is pretty good and it's obvious they spend time sourcing good ingredients however I can't get over the attitude of the place.  I live in Denver and go to Snooze once in a while and the service has always been quite good."}
{"text":"I honestly don't think I have ever had a more delicious pancake in my entire life than the one I had at Snooze. I did have low to average expectations of this place but the second I tried their pineapple and smores pancakes, I was hooked. SO GOOD. I have since had other savory options for breakfast and they were also wonderful. However nothing tops those pancakes. I also appreciated the staff; they are always in good spirits and but don't assault me with morning pep of which I have none. Perfect place. Can be super crowded on the weekend mornings but it's expected as it is the weekend and this place is fantastic. Definitely give it a go!"}
{"text":"Not terribly impressed with this place. My husband had the breakfast burrito and it just looked gross. It was basically eating Mexican food for breakfast. I ordered an omelette and substituted one pancake instead of toast for an outrageous $4. All the pancakes have some kind of sauce or cream or something smothered on it. You have to order plain to have it remain somewhat healthy. Our breakfast was $30 without ordering any drinks. I will not be back here. US Egg is still the best breakfast in the city."}
{"text":"I Rate this a five star.  Nice upbeat environment, superb service with a flare for attention to providing you with an enjoyable and memorable eating  experience.  Wide variety of enticing dishes, with a choice of adventuresome drinks.  Kids menus are available and a veteran discount is available."}
{"text":"I tried to love Snooze Camelback.  We went three times.  The Bloody Mary is good, and it makes the 45 minute wait tolerable, but it's downhill from there.  For me, weekend breakfast out in the Valley usually means the following, for which Snooze Camelback is guilty on all counts:   --- Service is harried, and the check is dropped when you're just far enough from being finished for it to feel rude.  Amplifying the annoyance is that it's invariably offered with a disingenuous \"no rush, guys\". --- Most Valley breakfast restaurants I've been to have an open concept, which makes the cacophony of a packed house unbearable so early in the day. --- No Valley cook who prepares my eggs understands what EGGS OVER MEDIUM means.  We always thought the distinction between eggs OVER EASY (soft, possibly runny white with liquid yolk) and OVER MEDIUM (fully cooked white with yolk having the rich, unctuous viscosity of warm custard) was a given.  In the Valley, your real choices are over easy or over hard.  I have learned that having the cook remake it is an exercise in futility.  They either don't know or don't care to know.  SPECIFIC TO SNOOZE CAMELBACK:  On the last two outings, I had to send my dish back to the kitchen for being cold.  Forget any contrition or nicety regarding as much.  Your server will have too many tables to utter more than six words about fixing it.  The food is good, but not memorable.  Add that to the rest, and Snooze Camelback is wholly forgettable."}
{"text":"I've never ordered as much food as I did and actually finished it all. Definitely worth the 40minute wait! Don't be discouraged just because there's a long wait-that means the food worth eating(: amazing"}
{"text":"I visited with my brother and encountered great service and food! Although his food came out first and I had to wait a bit the manager, Ramon Soto, noticed and quickly took care of us! He didn't have to pay for our food because it was a busy morning and I understand things can get hectic in the kitchen but he made it a great experience which we are grateful for! The eggs Benedict duo and upside down pancake was amazing!! Wish I could return but I am visiting my brother and his wife from out of town but I know my brother will definitely be back! Whenever I fly in though I will definitely make a visit here again!! Great food, great staff and beautiful town!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting Arizona for the first time and stopped here before making the drive back to LA.  The food was great, but... The hostess told us that it would take 15-20 minutes. We get a text saying that our table is almost ready. 45 minutes in, we ask them about our table, since others who came after us are getting seated before us. The manager(?) goes and tells the hostess that it will take longer than 15-20 minutes for people to be seated, but after he walks away, she continues to tell people it will be a 15-20 minute wait. We sit down, and by now, we're starving and really angry that we're going to miss the REI garage sale because of the situation. No one comes over to help us for a few minutes and we watch as one of the employees stands around flirting with a table full of college girls next to us. The girl who ends up taking our order rarely checks on us and I don't think we ever saw her smile. What a strange experience."}
{"text":"After waiting for 65 min. to get a table it took another 35 min. to get our food.  The food was ok, not worth waiting an hour in a half for.  My Husband ordered and sausage with mushrooms and cheddar cheese the one he got was pulled pork, three little mushrooms and hardly any cheese :( after waiting 35 min. to get it there was no way he was going to send it back.  The Chocolate Chip pancake was good, corn beef hash was good as well.  The best part of it was we were having brunch with our Son."}
{"text":"Great perky breakfast place.... and I'm not a breakfast eater! LOL But very cute place! Love their coffee mugs and cute design concept! Don't miss it if you ARE a breakfast eater! Their service was slow for a breakfast joint but it has been packed both times I've been there."}
{"text":"Decent food, but way overpriced. 3 eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast with a coffee was almost $14. The food was tasty but nothing special. Atmosphere was nice and waitress' were friendly."}
{"text":"Been twice now and LOVEEE the corned beef hash and they have a pretty good bloody mary. A1 pancakes can't really go wrong food wise! The only reason I take off a star was the service we received at the bar. The first time we came in we had a super fun server (wish I remembered her name so I could give her the shoutout). But bartenders seemed extremely uninterested and I felt like I was pestering them every time I asked for something! Still an awesome breakfast place especially after old town."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. We had a party of six people and took only 20 minutes for a table on a Saturday morning at 10am. The staff were all great. You can really tell that they enjoy working there. We ordered the pancake flight with chocolate chip, blueberry danish and the special bacon (who doesn't love bacon. We also ordered the Snooze Spuds and 3 egg omelette. Everything we had was delicious and not one bite was left behind. I would return again the next time I am in Tempe."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast! Staff is very friendly, they are fast at getting food out. Definitely want to come early because they get packed fast! Ordered the eggs Benedict and it was delicious! Also ordered the Ruben sandwich and it was great too!"}
{"text":"Ohh this place is fun! I love, love the decor. Takes me back to my childhood. I meet a friend here on a chilly morning this week. Neither of us had ever been here before but, it was on our list to try. So glad we did. The location is the old Soupor Salad which was there in Town and Country for many , many years. We were so sad when it closed. But, Snooze is all remodeled and cool and clean inside. The food was wonderful! very unique on a lot of items. I got an Eggs Benedict that I had never tried any where else. It was a Vegetarian version. On a bed of Grits rather than an English Muffin ,eggs,cooked just right. As well as the wonderful Hollandaise  sauce and some really great vegetables as well. The Hash Browns have been made in a form so they are nice and neat! Plus, the Coffee was wonderful. Not too strong and not weak either. The Ladies room was nice and clean with Dyson Hand dryers! Lots of parking in the lot as well."}
{"text":"This place was busy and delicious! We sat at the bar - no wait.  Our server Elisa was awesome and the food fantastic.  My husband enjoyed blueberry danish pancakes. I loved the pineapple upside down pancake.  A new favorite place when visiting Phoenix.  Lots of choices and friendly service.  Mimosas were just a bonus! Thanks Elisa - you rocked!"}
{"text":"We had our first visit today and my mother and I both agree we'll definitely be back. We sat in the back patio because it's not overly hot in AZ yet, so we might as well enjoy the weather while we can. I was sort of hesitant bringing my one year old with us because some restaurants are not baby or kid friendly. When we walked in I asked if they had highchairs and the woman behind the seating counter laughed and said something along the lines of \"How can we be a restaurant in Gilbert and not have highchairs.\" Oh yes, I forgot, we're in the suburbs...silly me. The atmosphere was pretty nice, but the food is what we will come back for! Delicious! Any place that serves breakfast and booze (mimosas, and good ones at that!) deserves some recognition. Our server was awesome. She was sweet, prompt and accommodating. I'm a manager at another restaurant, so I can tell when the staff likes where they work...It does make a difference in their service!"}
{"text":"Bomb pancakes! Weekday wait wasn't as bad as the weekend wait which was 60-80 minutes!"}
{"text":"Another gem that Yelp led me to.  Saw the ratings and decided to check this place out...a hipster, cool breakfast joint with amazing menu choices and great atmosphere.  I had the Hashbrown plate, topped with 2 sunny-side up eggs and added hickory sausage gravy and bacon.  Now if you are a \"carbophobe\" I would suggest you not order, but if amazing spuds are your weakness you won't go wrong.  The plate came loaded with country-style hashbrowns and my guess is 50000+ grams of carbs (at least) :).  Also ordered a cappuccino and was pleasantly surprised with it's somewhat chocolatey flavor that was unusual in a great way.  Breakfast for one with cappuccino and tip was $20, but very well worth it. A couple of things to note: 1.  My Google map app was trying to take me wayyyy off course, so I am not sure if it was just my phone or if it's a Google map defect?  If you are unfamiliar with the area around ASU be careful you don't get sent to East Bumble F by your phone.  Take University to College Ave, go north on College and it's on the right near the aquatic center 2. There is no parking lot so you either park on the street near the restaurant or there is a parking deck on the little street behind the restaurant.  If you choose street parking the parking spots are metered and will take coins or, get this, will accept your phone reading a QR code to bill the parking fee.  I had no spare change and my phone would not read the code so I headed over to the deck and lo-and-behold...parking was free (it was Saturday morning, 8.30am and evidently not a \"game day\").  BTW the restaurant is maybe a block from Sun Devil Stadium so I can only imagine the mess it would be when the Sun Devils are playing at home. I LOVE SNOOZE AM!  Definitely a chain that would dominate if it goes nationwide!"}
{"text":"This has become my top breakfast go to, usually to recoup from a night of drinking too much. Not only do the have a wide range of mimosas to cure the hangover, but all of the eggs Benny's and their wide variety of flavors has always left me satisfied. I honestly haven't been able to try anything else on the menu because being able to get an eggs benny duo is the only thing I have ever dreamed of."}
{"text":"This is a neat throw- back looking type of restaurant whose claim-to -fame is that they are open only for breakfast/brunch.  I ordered the tomato, mushroom, and spinach omelette, whole toast with homemade jam. which came with a very tasty hashbrown. All of it was delicious! My husband ordered the French toast strips and said they were good, except they were more like a dessert than breakfast food, but no complaint taste- wise. It's a a trendy place that is also a bit on the expensive side, but sometimes trendy and \"pricey\" go hand in hand.  They also have outdoor eating."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I went as a group of 4 plus 2 babies. The servers were super friendly and sweet. They d√©cor was fun and bright. We had to wait a while but it was Saturday and it's always busy in this area. I got the Snooze Continental which was a half grapefruit (so good) and the greek yogurt with really good granola and agave nectar drizzle. Amazing! The drinks were really good but a little pricey... $7-8 for a mimosa. I would go again!"}
{"text":"Food is great, but the service here is terrible. Definitely the D-League of Snooze service. For example, ticket times were slow, food was missing, food spilt on me, and not a single apology. Do not go to this location if you are expecting the food to match the service. Go to the other locations."}
{"text":"Snooze SNOOZES ON SERVICE: waited 30 min for a table on a Sunday morning. Finally seated and our order was taken. 35-40 min later the waiter came back to inform us that he forgot to put in our order then asked me , \"what did you order again?\" With no mention of doing something to make it up to us. We cancelled the order then left the place. Too bad, it looked good. Whah, whahhh...."}
{"text":"Snooze was really good however the wait was slightly long (30 minutes) however I should have expected this because it was a Saturday morning. I had their Mocha coffee which was excellent and not too sweet. I also ordered the ham/bacon Benedict as my entree which came with hash browns. The ham Benedict was amazing and very filling, however I was not impressed by the hash brown cake (wasn't crispy all the way through to my standards, the outside was crispy while the main portion was not). Good service good food will probably be back."}
{"text":"The pancakes are always good and I love how they have a pancake special each day.  My wife loves the Bennys and the quinoa bowl is also good.  This is our go to weekend brunch place."}
{"text":"Located in historic Gilbert amongst several eateries and shops, Snooze is one of those places you seek out when your in town visiting! A breakfast/lunch joint, this place never disappoints! Be warned though, you may have a wait, however it's well worth it. They offer all options under the sun and the food is fresh and fantastic! Who knew chicken sausage was so darn good? ... and the upside down pineapple pancakes... \"damn Gina!\"   Shout out to Ms Katie for making our trip into Snooze that much better! We appreciate ya!   Ps... Tucson. Hint hint."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding and the service was good.  Definitely not your local First Watch.  Some great menu selections.  The breakfast tacos we off the hook.    Yummy Yummy!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Snooze for the first time today. We were pleasantly surprised at how great everything was from start to finish. Service was impeccable, food was AMAZING, and the house coffee was delicious. Shannon our server, was very attentive and friendly, which was a great start to the morning. I had the corn beef hash, which tasted like it came straight out of a New York deli, and that is the greatest compliment you can bestow upon the dish. My wife, had the breakfast burrito, which was very large and absolutely delicious, according to her. Ambiance was lively and fun, and Snooze will definitely be one of our new spots for breakfast."}
{"text":"It is the cutest restaurant in Gilbert.  Love the decor and branding but we were not blown away by the food or service.  The concensus at our table was that the sweet potato and chocolate chip pancakes were awesome, the strawberry shortcake pancake was decent , the blueberry danish pancake needs work (the pecan crumble tasted oddly like bacon), and the corned beef hash was just average.  The server was slow, not particularly friendly but attentive.  I think they need a few more weeks to work out the kinks.  Get there  early!  We got right in at 7am on a Sunday but there was a 30-45 min wait when we were leaving.  The flight of pancakes is an interesting idea for those who like variety, but when you only enjoy one of the 3 it makes for a pricey pancake. Oh and the hot chocolate is just warm chocolate milk. The bill for our table of 4 was about $80...not a great deal for the quality. We wouldn't have minded paying that amount if the food was amazing, but it wasn't. I guess we could all have used a mimosa. ;)"}
{"text":"Had one of the best server interactions from Christie. I highly encourage to ask for her. I asked for well done hashbrowns the kitchen delivered the best I could ask for. My favorites for sure are the pineapple upside down pancakes and the OMG french toast! This is for sure my favorite breakfast spot and we will be back!  Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Breakfast here was excellent.  Got the pancake flight and all pancakes were so delicious.  The corned beef hash also tasted great.  Overall, food and service is top notch"}
{"text":"Came here off of a recommendation with two of my friends and the wait wasn't terrible we sat down after a 10 min wait. I got the mmm mmm mimosa and that was amazing both of my friends got coffee one had ice coffee and the other had regular coffee and they both agreed that there coffee was good. Now when it came to the food I've had way better breakfast food the chocolate chip pancakes where just ok. My one friend had the breakfast pot pie she said she couldn't even justify now could it could've been because it was ice cold. My other friend had the Bella Bella Benny and the Benny good man and all she has to say was gross the hollandaise sauce had way to much mayonnaise in it and did nothing for it. The waitress was not that great ether it just really seemed like she didn't wanna be there maybe she was just having a bad day"}
{"text":"Delicioussssss!!!!! I got the Benny Duo with Ham Benedict and the Chilaquiles!! They were both really good but I definitely LOVED the chilaquiles Benedict!!! So amazingggg! And the service was awesome!!! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Waited less than 10 minutes at 8:45 am on a Saturday for a table outside (had the dog with us). Waitlist sends you a quick text when the table is ready - and the text includes a link to the menu. Nice touch. We were quickly served - had tofu scramble, wife had breakfast burrito and soy latte. Food was great. Service was attentive yet unobtrusive. Prices were more than fair for the quality of food served. They have doggie bowls for water if you're there with Fido.  Will definitely return again. Tip from the waitstaff: Arrive well before 9 am on the weekends as it tends to get extremely busy 10:15 am onwards on the weekends. Not a problem for us at all."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast.  All Benedict dishes and the Pancake flight are delicious.  Ask for the cinnamon roll pancake (not on the menu)!   We sat at the bar and Michelle was a perfect server.  Thanks and we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing and friendly service and the mimosas are the perfect addition to a great breakfast. Flew in from Houston for a concert and wanted a good breakfast place that served alcohol and this it's it. A lot of locals come here and get greeted like of they walked into Cheers."}
{"text":"There was a wait, which was our choice to wait for, as we were excited to dine there. The wait wasn't as long as we were told, which was great. We chose to wait for a table outs to dine, which usually takes longer than inside. Wouldn't want to sit inside tho, kinda squished and loud. Friendly hostesses, our server was very nice, obviously busy, but not great as a server. Food is definitely not what we expected. I ordered the Pancake Flight,... pancakes were dry & tasteless, needed more of the \"fillings/toppings, just to try to eat them.  My husband ordered an omelet that had jam, sausage, and cheese in it. The sausage had a weird taste, ham was good, and so were the hash browns.  We aren't going back, rather spend $30 somewhere else for a better meal."}
{"text":"That food was delicious and the service was great but the water was not up to par. it tasted like sink water and not the good kind. Overall i would come here again but next time I'll bring my own water."}
{"text":"Apparently they have these in California, Arizona, Texas, and Colorado - how about coming to Milwaukee!? This is a swanky indoor & outdoor brunch spot. I had a Bangkok Bloody while we waited for our table - it had Sriracha, lime, cilantro, basil, fish sauce, and fixings - very unique & satisfying! When I got to the table, I also ordered an iced dirty drunken chai with espresso, coffee liquor, and cruzan rum - again, very delicious. Our server was hilarious and great - even sitting down and chatting with us for awhile. The perhaps best thing about this place is that you can order a Benny Duo - can't deiced which benedict you want to order? No problem, you can get 1 of each!!! Every girl's dream. They have lots of options (classic, lox style salmon & cream cheese over toasted rye, prosciutto & arugula over ciabatta, and more) but I ended up going with the Chili Verde with pulled pork and Steak + Eggs atop roasted poblano cheddar grit cakes with asparagus, roasted mushrooms, and tomato. They were both probably the best benedicts I've ever had. A+"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite breakfast spot.  When you walk in you will notice a fun light atmosphere. The decor is bright and clean, the staff is friendly and appears to really enjoy their job. The menu has enough selection without being overwhelming. The dishes are all vegetarian, you can add meats for a small additional charge.  The alcoholic beverages are really good and refreshing.  He juice and coffee is fresh. There's nothing on that menu that doesn't taste good.  As of amazing food isn't enough, the awesome staff makes the visit worth it."}
{"text":"Came in and was seated right away. Waitress brought us water and it took her another 15 minutes to come back and take our order. Once our order was placed it took 30-40 minutes for our food to show up. Sitting now for about an hour and no food.   Once the food arrived it was really good!  I had to stop another waitress to fill up my empty water glass.   Finally after being here for an hour and a half ,if not more, I flagged our waitress down with my credit card.   Our service and wait time REALLY sucked!!! But the food was so good we will have to come back and give it another shot.   Annnnd now I am 40 minutes late to a meeting. #awesome"}
{"text":"It is worth the wait... I had the best experience yesterday at snooze. Our waiter Michael was so much fun, we were being silly and he was laughing with us. He even gave us a pineapple upside down pancake that was absolutely amazing! I have never had a pancake so good in my entire life hahaha  I will be back and I want to sit in Michael's section....I'll wait!!!"}
{"text":"Let me first start out by saying my server was so nice. However, we waited over an hour for our food that never arrived. The mimosas were delicious and I would love to comment on the food but I never got the chance to actually taste it. Apparently our ticket was put in during a high volume time and the kitchen was backed up but yet customers who came in after us received their food before us. I would highly recommend going to the restaurant next door, you'd most likely get to taste the food there."}
{"text":"I am so HAPPY they opened one up in AZ!! When I lived in Denver this was the spot to go to! Since its so good, the wait is pretty long. They have an awesome system down which they text you when your table is ready! Good thing Nordstrom Rack and all the other places are around the restaurant so you can go shopping! There is FREE water and coffee in the back which I LOVE! It's like getting free bread or chips and salsa when you go to a dinner restaurant! You can't go wrong with anything on their menu! **EXCITED**"}
{"text":"I have had a couple things that weren't  perfect here, but I go often and normally  love it, so I attribute  the funky times to new employees I guess. Love the Pineapple  pancakes and omelets! Nice patio and in good weather the windows open."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place!!! Had a pancake trio and thought I died and went to heaven!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Here's a restaurant that found a niche and sticks with what works!  had the pancake sampler, corned beef hash, eggs benedict (different types), and other stuff (table of six).  Mimosas were flowing and it was a great breakfast place.  Time for more restaurants in the area as this one was always crowded (20 minute wait at 10am on Friday morning)!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb and and the service is also the bomb! Snooze is the best breakfast place to go in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast when you are down and around ASU.  Eggs Benedict was excellent.  They actually know how to poach and egg, and have the Hollandaise down pat! (Also, the late-90s play list is on point)"}
{"text":"Besides the insane wait time (which tells you it's worth it but waiting forever sucks!) and no misters outside (come on, guys- it's freaking hot in Arizona!!) it was great! I love when servers love their job and are so kind and helpful! I love that I can get almost everything gluten free and it's delicious!! The cinnamon roll pancake- amazing! Omelette, amazing!"}
{"text":"We came here for a Sunday brunch, the wait was about an hour to even get seated. The service thereafter was okay, the waitress wasn't very genuine or friendly. It seemed like the service all around was whatever, the table next to us had received all of their food minus one poor girl who didn't get her food until everyone was nearly done. As we waited we also saw people paying at the front so they could get going rather than waiting for the slow service.   The food was definitely great, but not worth an hours worth of wait. I would recommend taking your business elsewhere if you have to wait longer than 20-minutes for this place. Unless you want to spend 2.5 hours at brunch!"}
{"text":"Worst eggs and bacon ever. Not sure what grease they cook with, but it tasted disgusting!!! And my stomach hurt all night long. This restaurant cooked their bacon in additional grease...who does that? All I could taste was some funky grease, I couldn't even taste any of the natural bacon flavor expected from bacon. And I ordered my eggs basted and they too tasted greasy and watery. So disappointed after driving for nine hours and it being my first meal in Chandler Arizona. I would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago with a friend. I loved it, and when I love a food place, I bring other friends. With another friend, I returned today. She was irate with me because, in her words, \"this is the *best* food I've eaten in 4 months\".   I can't believe I'm saying this because I love their food so much, but it's even more delicious than Butters/Butterfields. Who thought that could be possible?   Both times, my friend and I have shared the following: Juan's Tacos, the option to order (2)  1/2 orders of Egg Benedict (the name of it isn't coming to mind), and the Pancake Flight. The Pancake Flight lets you sample any 3 of their fancy schmancy pancakes.   My favorite really is the Juan's Tacos; they're probably the best tacos I've eaten some I moved to Phoenix 10 yrs ago. You get 3 opened faced tacos on soft tortillas(ask them for the Cholula sauce). It comes with a grilled jalape√±o pepper, and this hash brown \"muffin\". It's a hash brown that's about 1 in thick, and shaped into a perfect cylinder. The hashbrowns are so good, you'll close your eyes as you're savoring them.  For a place in a posh area like the Biltmore, the prices are incredibly decent; about $9-$12/entree. It's incredibly popular. Today the wait was 45 min. After I put my name down, I heard the hostess tell another person that seating at the bar, and the side of the bar was open...first come first serve. Luckily for us, I was able to snake 2 chairs at the bar. Our wait time was cut in 1/2."}
{"text":"Breakfast will never be the same!  I tried the Chili Verde Benedict with Pumpkin flavored pancakes and house made corned beef hash.  The flavors on each were amazing!!  The wait was well managed and service was efficient.  I hope to have the time to eat here again soon."}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful find! They have a pancake flight! How amazing is that?! I love pancakes & that's the best thing you could give a pancake lover. I tried the strawberry-rubarb, pineapple upside down & banana Nutella. They were all delicious! My husband had the chocolate peanut butter pancake & his was just as good. Everything tasted wonderful! It's a must try for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Good but not great. That's about all I can say. The prices are a little high for what you get. Second time there, nicely decorated. However it was worth going but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast around! The boyfriend and I come weekly in the afternoon. Staff is always friendly and service is quick. Our usual server is Carla, who's a sweetheart and does an awesome job."}
{"text":"Updating this review.   Have been back three times since receiving my gift certificate (thank you so much!!) Came once again with mom, and twice with friends. The time I came with mom, they actually did get her eggs wrong but it was kind of an odd situation, we had 2 servers that day and the one server had kind of joked around with her about ordering her eggs poached well (I make fun of her for this too!) so they had to redo the eggs but other than that, the rest of the food was great except for I think the peach cobbler pancake I had. The pancake itself was good, but the peaches inside it were not ripe at all, and were hard/not cooked. I'm obsessed with the breakfast tacos, absolutely amazing and the other 2 times I've been back I've gotten the Blueberry danish pancake or something like that, and it's absolutely to die for. The only bummer has been that I haven't seen one of what must have been a seasonal pancake on the menu to try, which I think was a red velvet or a pineapple upside down, but it's ok, I'm hooked on the blueberry now so I'm not terribly broken up about it. My friend got the breakfast pot pie which I tried and that was good. The benedicts are good too, but those breakfast taco's are gonna be hard to beat. I really think they need to have a \"breakfast for dinner night\" at LEAST once a week...maybe Thursday's or Fridays..."}
{"text":"First of all, this is the cutest place ever. Wish I could have spent more time there to play in the back patio. The food was great and the service was great.  The front patio was fun to have a drink and wait for our table.  I just loved it here"}
{"text":"I love the tofu scramble from here! So flavorful and you can add 3 items to it, so I added pico de gallo, arugula, & avocado and I must say it was super delicious! It comes with toast and hash browns that are very good. I also ordered an almond milk latte, but it was too sweet for my liking. The previous time I came here, my niece ordered the hot chocolate and it was one my favorite hot chocolates I've had in a long time. The only dish I didn't really care for was the lox dish, but aside from that I've always enjoyed the dishes I've ordered."}
{"text":"Great spot with great breakfast items..   Even though it's a chain, I'm happy to see THIS chain come to Austin.   Austin isn't very welcoming of outsider restaurants.   Glad I tried this one in Phoenix.    Overall, great atmosphere and selection"}
{"text":"The wait can be very long here.  The staff is friendly.  The food is truly some of the best breakfast I have ever had."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place out because of all the good comments I've heard from my friends! My boyfriend and I sat down and the table was dirty and we waited awhile for someone to greet us and we had to ask her to wipe the table. I ordered a chai and it was delicious! He got a coffee and loved it. He ended up getting one Togo too. I ordered French toast with a side of hash brown. The meal was incredibly sweet and drenched in Carmel sauce. The hashed browns were so dry and didn't have much flavor in them. The price was expensive but the restaurant was adorable and a fun place to be. The drinks were great! Maybe next time I'll have to get something else from the menu."}
{"text":"I love snooze Am Eatery!  The wait time is horrible, very bad.  But the brunch is delicious. I highly recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Did not really care for this place. the decor is definitely trendy and cute, that part I liked.   for starters, I ordered a caramel latte. I couldn't even hold the mug it was so hot. no foam, super  milky. where was the espresso? the caramel flavor was not that good either.   Havana daydreaming - whole plate came out cold, hash browns potatoes were under cooked. hollandaise tasted like plastic.  eggs benny duo - verde and the rancheros were both delicious. hash browns again under cooked. they were actually crunchy  michelada - Delicious  gazpacho drink - fantastic  server I forgot his name he was awesome. since it was our first time there he gave us a sweet potato pancake. it was very tasty, too much syrup was definitely an over kill. but it tasted like a creme brule which is fantastic."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this a five and out of four is because we came at 1 PM therefore we didn't have to wait an hour to get service. Usually this place is very busy and the wait is over 30 minutes. Other than the usual wait, everything else (service and food...and even drinks) are amazing. Kid friendly, best selection of Benedict's and the service was quick and the staff was friendly. We will be back, but after the morning crowd of course. That is the smartest time to eat here!"}
{"text":"This place surpassed my expectations! The food was amazing, I had the OMG French Toast and an OJ Mimosa, so delicious, and the service was just as wonderful! Can't wait to be back and try something different."}
{"text":"This was literally the best breakfast place I have ever eaten. I had the French toast neat with a side of hash browns and I ate the whole thing."}
{"text":"The is a wonderful restaurant that has a nice 1960's theme. The restaurant is bright and cozy I ordered the quinoa bowl which was very good and light. I enjoyed the coffee and purchased one pound for the road. We sat in waitress Dre's section she was an excellent waitress who was very attentive and had a wonder smile and personality!"}
{"text":"First: Do not order the lemonade. $4 and no refills. Seriously no cares if it is organic and cold pressed...blah blah blah. I was just thirsty. My fault for not looking it up first I guess....  Next: The pancakes are absolutely amazing. Just sinful...like blisteringly amazing and each flavor is significantly different from the others. The Pineapple upside down pancake and the Sweet potato pancake were unreal. I just can't say enough...superb.   Also the bacon was what bacon should be ....GREAT!  The service was a bit spotty (I hear that there were a bunch of trainees that day) but I had a little spontaneous dance party with one of the staff in the middle of the dining room which totally made up for it!  All in all this place is genius, just genius. ...except for that lemonade."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and delicious food! A breakfast MUST if you are in the Tempe area. Such a nice patio area for open air dining! I recommend the MMM MMM Mimosa and any of the eggs Benedict dishes."}
{"text":"Every so often I enjoy going out for breakfast and Snooze is one of my favorites. It does get busy on the weekends but there is always the farmers market on Saturdays to help pass the time quickly. My husband and mom enjoyed spicy blood Marys. The service is good, fun atmosphere, and a ton of delicious food to choose from on the menu! Loved the 90s alternative music that was playing, too, took me back!"}
{"text":"This place is busy and for good reason! We got here just before the rush and can't wait to come back to try more on the menu. If you do anything get the Sweet Potato Pancake, it comes with caramel syrup, candied pecans, and ginger butter."}
{"text":"When we arrived there was a 30 min wait for a table, so we headed over to the bar for a little beverage. Upon ordering our \"palomimosas\" we were told to order at the other end of the bar... So we went over and ordered, standing... \"That it?\" Ummm no.. We are gonna have brunch standing here... We were seated outside, the patio is lovely.  Service was spotty... Water glasses always empty.. Food took about 40 minutes..... Think the wait staff took the restaurant name to heart... Snooze much? That being said, the food was quite satisfactory and I will give the establishment a second chance."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our breakfast but most likely won't bring us back:(   Snooze is pricey and gave both of us stomach problems the rest of the day.   My honey & I came here on accident.  Snooze was able to substitute meat and egg for faux meats. They have two faux meats: tofu and soyrizo.   While my plate was $10. My honeys plate was $23 alone. Note: a side of sausage patty is $4.  A large juice, which is a regular sized water glass was $4. Maybe it's me but $4 seems steep for one glass of OJ.   It would be easier to have an indicator on the menu with \"V\" for vegetarian/vegan options or a separate menu all together for dietary restrictions such as gluten free, vegetarian or vegan.   My server was aware what vegan was and knew what I can't eat. My server knew the dietary restrictions, as far as to make sure the bread I was eating was not animal deprived. Thank you for that."}
{"text":"I went in with my girlfriend earlier this week at 7am. They open at 6:30am. There were at least 10 servers on the clock and maybe 3 tables other than us. The service was pretty bad. We got sat in the area where the bartender served us. Not sure why but no big deal. We quickly ordered because I had to get to the airport. The staff was very busy rolling silverware, eating their own breakfasts, hanging out by the coffee station talking about their last nights experiences, laughing, having a great time. We however waited a very long time for our food. I asked the manager if he could check on it because it was taking so long, he went in the back and the food came right out... hmm. He did not come back over and ask if everything was ok or apologize. Actually no-one said anything about it. Our server was not at all attentive once we got our food and didn't thank us when she brought the check. No one said a word to us when we were leaving. The food was good but we definitely did not feel welcome and if you have anywhere to be don't go early during the week. They are more concerned about customers coming in later and chatting about their personal lives."}
{"text":"Waited less than ten minues for a table during the week.  Blueberry Danish Pancakes don't have blueberries inside of them.  Swirled on top is blueberry coulis which is a fancy way of saying blueberry syrup.  The french toast looked and tasted so so.   I was not offered a second cup of coffee.  They forgot our side of eggs (not a big deal) but when they came (promptly) they looked nice but were cold.  Also, I love Boyd's and Royal Cup coffee.  It is served at Gilbert House, Butterfield's in Scottsdale and First Watch.  The coffee here was just okay."}
{"text":"So delicious!  We've converted everyone we bring here into a snooze fan.  The pancakes are massive and delicious, especially the pineapple upside down and the strawberry rhubarb...oh! and the sweet potato pancake with ginger butter.    My go to order is-The Breakfast Pot Pie and switch out the toast for a pancake (extra charge, not much though) and it is the best mix of savory and sweet!  Go here!  On a saturday/sunday morning expect an hour wait, but there are shops their like nordstrom rack that you can wonder around while you wait.   Oh! and they let you have pets out on the patio"}
{"text":"Every visit I've made to Snooze has been great. For one thing, the service is always good. This time Angela was our server and she was friendly, really helpful with my friend's gluten-free needs and forthcoming with what she liked on the menu and recommendations. This seems to be the norm for Snooze.   We were seated promptly and decided on drinks. A Bankok Bloody Mary for me, consisting of MEll Vodka, Sriracha, Lime, Cilantro, Basil, Fish Sauce & House Bloody Mix. I added a nice slice of bacon which was just delicious. T. had something called a Cherry Pie cocktail which was tasty.   Breakfast for me this time was the \"Sandwich I Am\", a soft pretzel roll filled with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and a sausage patty, served with a side of smoked cheddar hollandaise & house hash browns. Arriving at the table it frankly didn't look like a lot of food on the plate, but let me tell ya: it was more than enough. The hash browns are served as a round patty (from a mold, I suppose) and are moist with just the right amount of crispy. The sandwich is really tasty, especially on the pretzel bun.   Snooze offers a pretty extensive list of breakfast selections, not the least of which are the pancakes. There's usually a \"pancake of the day\", one time being an apple-filled pancake which was, to this day I think, the best damned pancake I've tasted.   I'm not often in the area of Camelback for breakfast (though there are a number of locations in the Phoenix area) but Snooze is high on my list of stops. The service is exemplary and the food is always above par."}
{"text":"First impression : I'm about to die from starvation, why would I wait 50 minutes for breakfast! Lady, I did fasting cardio...cut me a break!  Well, my other half has lived nearby in the past and kept raving about this place. After listening to him and reading their yelp reviews, we decided to wait.  Once we were seated, I ordered a Kentucky coffee(so good) and French toast. Omg, it came with mascarpone and was the best French toast ever! My drink was also to die for! Ryan got a breakfast burrito, which was enormous! All three of us loved our food!  The menu has a ton of options and the restaurant has a full bar!   I'm so glad we waited and will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast stops in central Phoenix. Their food is always on point and their espresso drinks are great too - a bit stronger than most but still delicious!"}
{"text":"It's a fun and trendy breakfast place and my breakfast burrito was pretty good. I just thought it was ok. Not the greatest by any means."}
{"text":"Ahhhhmmmazing! Flipping tasty. Great atmosphere and menu variety. Staff was warm and helpful and the service was prompt. Zero complaints."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I had the egg Benedict combo with two flavors (five available). I had a mimosa and a cold brew coffee, both tasty.  I felt the portions were small.. which saved me from gorging but still left me wanting more. The wait staff was nice enough, nothing special. Biggest issue is the wait times. Over an hour wait, plus a wait for drinks.. and a wait for food after ordering. Wait wait wait.."}
{"text":"Love this place !!! Options range from healthy to decadent!! The service is always impeccable!! My friend introduced me to SNOOZE two months ago and I've been five times since... recently for my daughter's birthday!!! As always.... we had incredibly great tasting food !! surrounded by a great atmosphere!!  and fun energetic hard-working individuals!! Thank you !!!"}
{"text":"I have come to this place multiple times but keep forgetting to leave my review. I love this location, downtown Gilbert is starting to be the hit spot! The restaurant is a decent size with a back patio for eating and the front patio for waiting. On the weekends they have a portable bar out on the patio to accommodate the customers waiting. When they tell you an estimate time for waiting it's right on the money, they say 1 hour it will be 1 hour. That's probably my only complaint is the wait but understand it's in a busy location.  The vibe of the restaurant is very laid back and casual, with delicious food at a decent price. All the times I have gone with how busy the place is it's well kept (clean) with a few small exceptions, let's be realistic. The patio has games for families to play which is awesome. Another cool things is they allow you to bring your dogs but you are seated on the patio, for the dog lovers out there that's heaven for them and nice that they have a place to take there pets to. I will continue to come here on the regular for my breakfast meals!"}
{"text":"Snooze has an incredible menu and great breakfast/brunch cocktails! I go out of my way to have my casual business meetings here when possible!"}
{"text":"My daughter loves going here and the food and staff are great! I'm glad that Snooze finally made its way to Tukee!"}
{"text":"I had the flight of pancakes and a side of ham. Very sweet and delicious and such a happening cool place."}
{"text":"What an awesome place. The food is great with some offering spins put on it. The wait staff can and will tell you enthusiastically were the ingredients and products they use come from. Definitely a sense of pride here what for they are putting out.  Location is also great. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Not long of a wait but we got there real early. I am looking forward to going back and trying more things."}
{"text":"Holy cow.  This was unbelievable and I would eat here everyday if I could.  The family was completely satisfied on every level.  Bacon was outstanding.  Waffles, eggs, potatoes all perfectly done.  The best orange juice I've ever had.  I can't possibly describe how amazing this experience was.  Just too bad that I have to take a 3 hour flight to get here."}
{"text":"Ok. There are really good breakfast places and then there is Snooze. Fresh is the operative word. Had the breakfast tacos. Add some veggies. The roasted jalape√±o pepper is great."}
{"text":"I was working in the area and wanted to warm up so I went to this place for a hot chocolate and some toast. One slice of toast seemed fair @ $.75 but $4 for a hot chocolate seemed like highway robbery. I should have asked if there was refills and if I could take one to go for that price. I'd really like to know how they come up with that one. I did hear some one else mention the same price for a cup of orange juice so I don't think it's me. Can you imagine your drink bill if you came in with a family of 5 on top of your meal. I find it unreasonable."}
{"text":"Good service and fast seating due to the fact we arrived at 2pm before closing. My boyfriend and I are gilbert locals and have been anxious to go check out snooze but it's always been busy.. Like a 45 min wait so we usually go to Over Easy instead. Loved the brewmosa's and pumpkin pancakes!!! We both also ordered the breakfast burrito.. Not so great. It was a huge burrito but didn't have much flavor. It was drenched in some kind of sauce to give to flavor. I would give this restaurant another try because the pancakes were fantastic ! But not worth the long wait in the before noon hours. 3.5 starts!"}
{"text":"Waited way too long for our food to come, 40-45 minutes.  Food was good, great menu choices, but the bill was not correct.  Added costs that the waitress could not explain, just that 'that is what the computer came up with'.  Really?  Adjusted it which took another 5-10 minutes but still wasn't right.  I'll do Butterfields or Over Easy over this place."}
{"text":"Waited almost an hour for a table Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant is quite loud, and I found the music somewhat loud and rather grating (it's all top 50 female pop star music - Britney Spears and Company).  I don't see why they don't have seating on their patio, or why they have a ping pong table out there taking up valuable space.  I started with their $3.50 hot chocolate.  It was cinnamony, and the whipped cream definitely helped its richness.  I would have preferred it hotter and less syrupy, as it was slightly Hershey's chocolate milk flavored.  With bolder flavors (darker chocolate, more cinnamon) and a temperature increase it would be much better.  I tried the breakfast pot pie which consisted of a sheet of flakey pastry topped with cream gravy (no large sausage chunks despite what the waitress said) that included many large chunks of undercooked carrots, and an egg sunny side up.  I added on a side of chicken sausage ($3.75) which was not tasty - very bland and a little dry.  I should've gotten the chorizo.  The hashed brown potatoes were undercooked.  Everything was cooling off when it was served, rather than being steaming hot.  The food was fine, but I didn't appreciate the multitude of undercooked carrots at all.  The gravy could've used more sausage and spice/heat.  It was a good idea for a dish, but the components outside the egg and basic puff pastry crust didn't deliver.  Service was okay, though I didn't care for the waitress splitting the ticket down the middle, instead of breaking it into separate checks.  Parking was easy in front of Nordstrom Rack, which you can peruse while you wait for them to text you that your table is ready.  I'm glad I finally got to check this place out, but I don't see myself coming back, especially considering their prices."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot with nice vibe inside. Very friendly servers. While we were there, the QB for the Denver Broncos came in, so at least you know it's a Colorado-must!!! Food was fantastic. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great food, had breakfast, was really good.  Recommend this eatery to anyone interested in a different but nice type environment."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. We didn't want to wait 20 minutes for a table so we grabbed a couple seats at the breakfast bar. The ham Benedict was delicious. The environment was fun, retro decor and lively colors."}
{"text":"3 of us went on Sunday.  The wait gets longer and longer on weekends.  At least be up front about how long it will really be.  Once in the server was very rushed, and the orders were a bit mixed up.  She tried to make up for it, but when items are left out from prepared food it is not quite the same when they are added on the side.  Think it is just best to go to this place during the week and avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"This place has the worst fucking service times of any breakfast restaurant I have ever seen. So fucking pathetic that I left a $0 tip for the lazy fucking waiter there. You guys suck at serving customers."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. The hash browns were raw, the tortilla  on the breakfeast burrito was cold along with the insides. The green chile sauce was blah. The only good thing was the service was good, thanks Matt. Also the food is overpriced you are paying for the area. I get a much better breakfeast from Denney's. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"My go-to sit down breakfast place! I have tried the corned beef hash, Juan's Breakfast Tacos, and the O.M.G. French Toast. All of them are my favorite!!! I usually order the breakfast tacos and whoever I'm with, we share the O.M.G. French toast to have that sweet and savory mix! Soooo yummy!   I've introduced friends to this place and they are in love!! So that means I must be doing something right!   Great location, can get paced even on weekdays."}
{"text":"Well this morning I went to a place my customers suggested for breakfast.  They were on the money with this suggestion. we had an amazing breakfast, very nice atmosphere and great service. I work as a server as well and love hearing from customers dining experiences.  Not only did we have good food but we were able to watch the NY Mets game along with a fellow METS FAN D'angelo who was a very friendly server there. Our server Michele and the manager, (didn't catch his name, only know he is a Yankee fan.) were very accommodating. I had a chocolate chip pancake with salted Carmel, strawberries and coconut...YUMMMM."}
{"text":"First time here - followed the Yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed. Highly recommend - will be back."}
{"text":"I was looking to try a new restaurant, and this place blew me away!  Not too expensive, and the food was excellent! Strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Okay I have to admit I'm not a breakfast person at all I think eggs are eggs most of time pretty much everyone have the same thing lately I've been trying to explore new places found some pretty good ones lately and this was one of them there many was really interesting things I've never seen before like I had their sweet potato mash was fantastic little sweet eggs cooked perfectly and full flavor sweet potatoes didn't even need marshmallows it was so good the French toast was okay it was more caramel in sweet cream than anything Fred was not cooked crispy enough for me it was good probably when I get it again but definitely want to go back and try some more things and I menu Circe is pretty good too and the girl is always on top of the refills and is able to answer questions and give suggestions she was great in the area to must stop in for breakfast"}
{"text":"I was on a work trip and wanted to eat something other than hotel breakfast and saw this place on Yelp. It was moderately busy and they kindly sat me outside on my request. I ordered the breakfast burrito with green sauce and got the food relatively quickly. The service was great and responsive despite me being only 1 of 2 parties out in the patio. The burrito wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was good for the price!"}
{"text":"I can't recall how many times I've been here since it opened. Every time I've come for breakfast or brunch, I always try something different. My favorite is definitely the B.E.A.T Sandwich because of the flavor and whatnot. Second in line is the Huevos Racheros. YUMMY. I'd suggest that someone from your party go a little earlier to get in line for a table as there's always been a wait every time I've gone."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in a while.  Loved everything about this place.  The wait wasn't too bad but there was a wait the entire time I was there.  First, the use of technology was pretty cool.  They take your phone number and text you when your table is ready.  That was pretty cool.  I had scrambled eggs, hash browns and bacon and I substituted the toast with a Cinnamon Roll Pancake.  Everything I had was amazing.  The pancake was awesome.    The one mistake I almost made was having some of the pancake before I spread the butter that was on top.  Then I realized I didn't spread it and took another bite and wow.  That just really made a big difference.    The only real complaint I would have is that it takes a little bit for the food to come out but as good as it was, it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Tried the flight of pancakes... got the blackberry key lime (best in my opinion), cinnamon roll (not on menu) and blueberry. Very very filling!! Husband had biscuits & gravy. The biscuit was a pastry puff, so not as heavy as a traditional biscuit.  Good service as well as very good coffee!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Our wait wasn't as long as anticipated, but we did sit outside in the heat. I HIGHLY suggest that this venue get misters for their patrons. We almost went across the hall specifically because they have misters. Great, diverse brunch drink menu. Absolutely everything blew our tastebuds away and the service was great."}
{"text":"Overall I was not impressed.  I saw several great reviews and had high hopes and ended up very disappointed.  First, the use of space in this restaurant is atrocious.  Massive booths on the outside with entrance from either side of the booth, and half-moon tables with curved benches throughout the center portion of the restaurant.  They could have very easily made this a much more comfortable restaurant, however it appears they were more interested in a specific look versus functionality.  As far as the food goes, it was ok.  I had the Breakfast Burrito with chorizo and green chili sauce.  Very plain in flavor.  Sadly, I would say some of the local fast-food Mexican restaurants have much more flavorful breakfast burritos.  To be fair, I was with a large group and some of the group enjoyed their food more than me.  No one was overly impressed but some of them did feel their food and experience here was better than mine."}
{"text":"I was visiting my boyfriend in Tempe and we were so excited to try snooze. The line is always crazy so I knew we had to go here. But the food was just okay. My boyfriend had the OMG French toast which was delicious, but it was just thrown on the plate. I had the sandwich I am, which was a HUGE piece of sausage, and egg. But there wasn't a whole lot of flavor outside of that. The pretzel roll it came on wasn't that great, and it needed a lot more cheese. Our waiter was really attentive to the people next to us, but kind of glossed over us. I had to get condiments myself after waiting 15 minutes for him to come back! But, I really enjoyed the free coffee idea while you wait. It's a super cute place, and I really love the feeling of the place but overall, it was just okay."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was just eh. Because I was so unimpressed by the food, I probably won't be back. Place was packed though so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Everything and I mean everything is made from scratch! French toast is delicious and hash best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"OH yum!!  Breakfast was never better! The variety was amazing! The hollandaise sauce was superb!  The server, I am sorry I did not get her name (lots of cute tattoos!) was on top of us filling drinks and asking if there was any more she could do. Will go back soon!"}
{"text":"Really tasty breakfast spot. Go early though, the wait times are insane after 9 am. I love the pancakes and bacon here. The coffee is super delicious too."}
{"text":"Arrived early, still had a long wait.  After being seated had another long wait for orders to be taken. Food took more than 40mins and arrived lukewarm and slightly burnt.  Had to flag down waitress repeatedly for coffee, cream & sugar, butter, & napkins.  The place is cavernous and the noise level is overwhelming.  Save your time and money, Snooze is highly over-rated. The service is minimal and the food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious if you're looking for a breakfast place in the Phoenix area Snooze stands out from the rest! So good!"}
{"text":"Very close to a five star, but need to visit again to truly give it five stars.  Food that came out was all big, and truly gorgeous.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  The breakfast pot pie is awesome and they offer great mix and match options so you can enjoy the menu. Service was polite and responsive."}
{"text":"Love! It's always busy, so be prepared to wait. Get the bene-duo if you can't decide on just one!"}
{"text":"The hype is real! Breakfast was packed on a Friday morning at 9am. I took a seat at the bar so I could get my food right away. Great service!  I ordered their version of French toast. I was told that it was more on a sweet side with the vanilla creme. This French toast really was OMG! So good! It was sweet but I enjoyed every single bite. I also got a side of egg and bacon. The bacon want over cooked or undercooked. It was a thicker cut and so much flavor! Sunny side egg was perfectly cooked as well. Perfect combo to the OMG French toast   Great breakfast! Great service! 5/5"}
{"text":"I adore Snooze AM. My boyfriend and I are breakfast junkies. We don't do fancy dinners out. We get up early to slug coffee and break egg yolks together. I can never decide which benedict I want. The Chilaquiles Benny has a different bread base and the sauce... I love the sauce. The Bella Bella Benny feeds my constant craving to throw arugula on everything. The great thing is I can have one of each. Choices abound!   The staff here is friendly. A gal with blue hair chatted us up about my doppleganger in her comic club and gave us a complimentary pineapple upside down pancake a few visits ago and now I'm hooked on those. Kind gesture on a slow morning. It's now a breakfast \"appetizer\" for my boyfriend and I."}
{"text":"Eggs benedict are few and far between and rarely done extremely well, this places hits the nail on the head! Accompany it with a bloody mary on a sunday morning and you are set!"}
{"text":"My scramble with chorizo, mushrooms, and Swiss cheese was delicious, but barely warm.  The wheat toast was cold, but was promptly replaced by the server.  The hash browns were hot, but slightly undercooked.  We were seated promptly but no one acknowledged us at our table for at least ten minutes, despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy at noon.  I have definitely had better experiences at this restaurant in the past, so I hope today is not the new normal."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food and atmosphere! Can get crowded on a Sunday morning, so come early! There are GF options and the coffee drinks are great!!"}
{"text":"Wow, SUCH good food. Great presentation, tastes great, cute set up. I got the eggs benedict and was very happy with it. A+."}
{"text":"Snooze is by far my favorite breakfast place. Their entire menu is amazing. I love their omelettes, and I REALLY love all of their gluten free options. As someone who is gluten free, I sometimes get frustrated at the lack of menu options for me at restaurants I try, but Snooze is great! I definitely suggest trying some of their gluten free pancakes. They are incredible!   The service here is always great, but don't  go here if you are looking for a quiet breakfast spot. It's always packed and always pretty loud. I suggest arriving early, or be prepared to wait... Sometimes over an hour."}
{"text":"Amazing, friendly service from everyone who took our order, brought a drink, and brought our food. Went for breakfast early and it was busy for a Tuesday. All of the staff looked genuinely happy and ready for a great day even though it was 730 am. Mimosas were awesome and all food was super tasty! Highly recommend this place. If you wear scrubs on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday morning you even get half off your drinks! Great addition to downtown Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Long wait and good food. I would go back. The menu was very interesting and not just traditional breakfast fare."}
{"text":"The food was good,  good variety of food stuffs. Front end staff and waitress were very efficient and friendly. Only major issue was wait time. Apparently this a regulsr issue, so don't go if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Hash browns should be called hash black. The hash browns were nothing special. I'm a fan of golden brown hash browns so when I saw a tempe Snooze location I was excited because I've eaten at the Scottsdale location and it was the shizz. The eggs were a little under cooked I asked for over medium and got raw eggs. Blah. Bacon was good but the tortillas were a little sour. Service was great though."}
{"text":"Stopped here and ordered for pick up. The staff was super friendly and the food was so good. I ordered the corn beef hash and it was up there with some of the best corned beef I've ever had. Brother loved his huervos rancheros and my sister ordered the breakfast burrito and the were very happy with the flavor and portion."}
{"text":"Should you try this place?  Sure.  Is the food good? I wasn't amazed  Would I come back? Eh."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Snooze was in San Diego - a highlight of that vacation - so I was beyond excited to see them land in Phoenix, too! The menu is genius, really there is something for every taste. I'm a savory breakfast foods fan, but the pineapple upside down or blueberry danish pancake could change my mind again and again."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast!  I had The best pancake ever...blueberry Danish.  I could eat that every day!    The atmosphere was fun with great retro music. staff wad fantastic, friendly & quick. You have to try it to see it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. It's definitely worth the wait... a little pricey but it's soooo worth it. Make sure you're not in a hurry because this place is usually packed. Especially on the weekends. Had one of my very first dates with my boyfriend of 2 years. It's a really great atmosphere. I need to try the Bloody Mary. The employees are always fantastic and great service. The pancakes are huge! They gave us a complimentary pancake once. I think it was Valentine's Day! It was really nice! That's why we keep coming back."}
{"text":"100 beautiful love this place tha wait is pretty long though. Thank you for letting us eat here"}
{"text":"Home cooked food with excellent flavor. I had the corn beef hash and eggs (made with chunks of meat) with homemade toast and delicious jam. I had a bite of the OMG French Toast (which was delicious but super sweet). I also stole a bite of my son's pancake- equally good. If you come on a weekend expect to wait (we were there on a Sunday and waited 20 min to get seated). Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our first time at Snooze.  Our friend recommended the place,  he was right.  Everyone was friendly,  we didn't have to wait long on a Sunday morning. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  I love it that the menu is small, to the point. We ordered the benedict duo and pancakes flight. So delicious.  Needless to say our plates were clean.  We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'd heard about this restaurant and it's reputation in the mountains.  So when the family all woke up on new year's day, the youngest brother made us all trek down (from the North Valley) to Town & Country's new Snooze.  We were told 30-45 min wait and offered coffee while we waited.  We drank the coffee.  We got bored.  We wandered into Nordstrom Rack.  We tried on clothes,  We shopped,  We bought clothes.  An hour after our initial arrival... we get the text!  We were told a few minutes, you're next, just clearing a table.  10 minutes later, still waiting.  Several tables not being cleared.  Some tables get cleared!  We don't get seated.  Another 10 minutes later, we are seated.  The hostesses did not inspire confidence.  And it shouldn't take any restaurant 10 minutes to clear a table.  Our waitress is lovely.  She's knowledgeable and capable.  I like her.  She explains our options, gives us suggestions, etc.  I do the half benny as does a sister in law.  Many do pancakes, we have a burrito as well, a few pretzel sandwiches and pancakes on the side.  Coffee is good; I ordered grapefruit juice that was very delicious.  Food takes a while, they're clearly attempting to get the hang of things. Food arrives.  I like the classic benny half but not the mexican version (it's bland).  SIL doesn't like her mexican benny either, but the havana is deemed delicious.  Pancakes are fairly well received though husband and myself think they're too dry and kind of crunchy.  Husband also had Sam I Am sandwich and wasn't a fan.  I would go back to Snooze for the benedicts and the juice.  I think it has potential but it really needs to figure out it's service model and get people moving through faster.  In the meantime, I can have a similar or better brunch faster at other places.  Prices are pretty fair though.  Brunch for 6 split 3 ways as 31 (w/o tip for 2 people)."}
{"text":"Very tasty, nothing bland about this place. Omg French toast was amazing. Service was prompt and atmosphere is trendy and very comfortable. Will always recommend this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"What a find! This place is trendy, has good food, good portions AND alcohol!   Mimosas were a decent size - more like twice what you'd get elsewhere. I couldn't decide between the French toast or a pancake so the waiter suggested I do a half order so I could try both. Nice! BTW the French toast is delicious, and so was the pancake.   Patio seating is nice - even has heaters for cooler days. Definitely looking forward to my next visit. Worth the drive from the west valley."}
{"text":"Snooze does it right! They had quite the crowd on Saturday morning so the wait to get a table was about an hour. Trust me, it was worth the wait. They had a huge menu selection varying from different types of egg Benedict's to pancake flavors. There was also a choice to opt for gluten free bread as well! My favorites were the lemon poppy seed pancakes and the spicy Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"The food is a 4 star, bordering on 5. Gluten free pancakes of all varieties, which is awesome. Decor and cleanliness, 5 stars.  However, it is so loud in here, it's almost unbearable. The music was loud, so people were talking louder....uuuggghh. I'm here for breakfast, not to feel like I'm at a bar. Speaking of drinks, the soda was gross, completely flat and I never got a new one, I had to get iced tea instead. That should be a simple fix, but apparently not. Service was slow, but the waitress was very nice.  I've been to the one in Denver multiple times, so I was very excited when it came here. I'll give it a few months before I come back so they can work out the kinks."}
{"text":"I came here for the latest get together of the Breakfast Club. We usually get together on Saturday and not quite so early but this time we had to go Sunday because of other events and went early to beat the crowds. I didn't know it was a chain. Of course I had never even heard of it before but I'm glad I did. We sat outside I think because there were so many of us but it was great weather for it. I poked my head inside and it was very nice. Even though there were 14 or 16 of us, I lost count, our server did a great job. She was always checking on us and refilling drinks. Sure it took a little while but we were a large group. I like how they let you mix and match things to create just what you want. I got the blueberry pancakes and the French toast. I got the toned down French toast because I'm not a fan of coconut and something else that was on it. But it was still really good and so where the pancakes. I saw some good looking Benedicts around the table. I will have to try one of those next time because this time I was in the mood for pancakes then the French toast sounded really good too. I had a great time. Saw some Yelp friends that I feel like I haven't seen in a long time plus I got to sit next to one of my favorite Yelpers the beautiful Cheryl. I will definitely be back. I want to try some of the other things on the menu but the pancakes and French toast were great. I could not even finish the pancakes. They were huge but so good. I had to stop myself from eating more. Shout out to some Yelp friends: Meagan B, it was nice to met your stunt double lol your Mom, and Jennifer O and her husband and the staples of any great Yelp event Jon H. and Amy H. See you guys later."}
{"text":"Came with some girlfriends for brunch and my food was terrible. I ordered pancakes and it tasted like there was pepper in them. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Been here twice and we have enjoyed everything we have tried! I love the variety of the \"pancake of the day\" option with your entree and the pancakes are AMAZING !! The food is high quality !! Don't miss the Benedict's !! The staff is so friendly! If you show up and there is a wait .. They have a little grass area off of the back patio with table tennis and beanbag toss game! Stop snoozing and give SNOOZE a try !! It won't disappoint !!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to see Snooze come to AZ. The servers here are so friendly and you must try the barbacoa eggs Benedict. The only reason I knocked a star was due to location. It's on campus so parking can be a bit of a nightmare at certain times."}
{"text":"A friend took us here, saying their egg bennies were good.  First off, I love the decor in here! It has a late 70's, early 80's Brady Brunch era-esque feel to it. And the servers were in sweats and basically \"snooze\" lounge. Love it!  Anyways, my sis and I wanted a sweet and savory combo so we shared the lox benedict and their stuffed french toast.   This was among the better benedicts I've tried. The hollandaise sauce was delicious. The bread (I think it was rye) was tasty. The salmon was great. Everything paired off real well. Also, the hashbrowns that come with it were good.  The french toast was great too. It was stuffed with some kind of cream, I forget what it was.   All in all, this was a great breakfast place."}
{"text":"Very unique breakfast options that will keep you coming back again and again!  Amazing atmosphere, reasonable prices and a friendly staff make this place the ultimate breakfast eatery."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the staff is very friendly. There can be a long wait time so I would recommend going in very early on the weekends."}
{"text":"Normally breakfast places are very ho hum, but not this place! We joined a large group of yelpers for breakfast and I'm in love...with the food that is... they have a pretty eclectic menu of ommelettes, crazy pancakes and several styels of eggs benedict. I opted for the Havana Benny, think a cuban sandwich but eggs benedict. The base was this killer swiss bread pudding topped with poached eggs, ham, roated pork, pickeles and this creamy sauce. Just insanely good. Wifey was a bore and got a pick three items omellete and some hash browns. all in all, fantastic food. I also had a few breakfast cocktails..the Bangkok, which iwas a spicy bloody mary and then a breakfast manhattan...yup you read that right. think Irish coffee but with bourbon and espresso...stupid good. Al in all, great place and I cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"Holy deliciousness. I came here for the breakfast pot pie, and was sold on the pancakes and cocktails. Let me back up... the breakfast pot pie was good, but I wouldn't say it was 'great'. There was nothing wrong with it, it just had a few spices that don't match my tastes. Loved that it was in a puff pastry though, and that you get to choose the type of egg you want on top! Also, major bonus points at Snooze for being able to swap out different sides to customize your dish without it impacting the price- probably the best part about Snooze as a whole. I really wanted corned beef hash (which was A-MAZING) so I subbed out the regular hash browns for that instead.  Anyways, THE PANCAKES. I got a single blueberry danish pancake as a side to my pot pie, and oh my gosh I wish I had gotten a full stack. Normally, when you get sweetly flavored pancakes, they are super, supppppper sweet - you can hardly taste the pancake underneath. This was not the case at all at Snooze. This was the fluffiest, tastiest buttermilk pancake with a delicious light and sweet lemon cream cheese filling. The streusel, sweet cream, and blueberry topping are lightly drizzled over the top. No overkill at all - the perfect light enhancement to the delicious buttermilk of the pancake.  For beverage, if you don't get the mountain mule, you are severely missing out. This might have been the best breakfast cocktail I've ever had in my life, and I'm a big fan of brunch, so thats saying A LOT.  I will DEFINITELY be making Snooze a regular in my brunch rotation... I may even go back next weekend."}
{"text":"I had the bella benny and the caprese benny with hashbrowns, and tried a regular pancake on the side, as well as my friend's breakfast potpie. While the eggs benedict was really small, the flavor and quality ingredients were definitely there. The mozzarella on the caprese was divine and went well on a slice of ciabatta. And the prosciutto was a modern twist versus a traditional eggs benedict. The hashbrowns were okay and nothing I would rave about (not enough crunch or crisp for my taste). And don't waste your time on the breakfast potpie. I was excited to try it and it wasn't anything special. However, the rosemary added to the gravy was a nice touch. Lastly, the pancake was a nice little treat on the side, but nothing special (probably better off trying one of their more exciting pancake flavors)."}
{"text":"Amazing place, food will not disappoint!!! Pancakes are fabulous!!! Every flavor you can imagine!!!! There shouldn't be one bad review, discard those. Oh and if want mimosa or any other coffee liqueur drink they have it!!!!"}
{"text":"Best place to get breakfast ever! Love the pot pie meal and flight of pancakes I share with my husband!! On top of a full bar for a breakfast cocktail. Service is amazing and I am never disappointed!! Love the atmosphere at very location!"}
{"text":"My first time going to the Tempe location.  Although I didn't mind waiting outside (it was a beautiful day), the hostess quoted 20-25 minutes of waiting.  Luckily, there's free coffee while you are waiting.  We did not get seated until 45-50 mins.  I would say 4 stars, but minus one due to the inefficient timing.  The food was good and we didn't wait long for it.  I ordered the green chili benedict, which was good.  I am not a fan of their hashbrown style.  it comes in a puck.  I also split the Pancake Flight.  We had the sweet potato, the blueberry and the pineapple upside down.  All of them were delicious.  I'm glad I split them, because they were quite sweet.  I'm glad they made their way down from Denver!  I can definitely see my self going again while it is nice out."}
{"text":"I love Bloody Mary's, and this place has a smorgasbord of Bloody options! Great food, fun filled patio and phenomenal cocktails. Keep coming back for more..."}
{"text":"There is no reason to go to snooze when ncounter is within walking distance. The quality isn't terrible, but the prices make it seem like snooze thinks they invented breakfast.   The hollandaise sauce was thick, almost the consistency of nacho cheese you'd left sitting for a bit too long, and lacked the familiar spice or lemon zing you'd expect.   Snooze: ham Benedict (English muffin, ham, egg, hollandaise, shredded hash brown) 10.50; $13 out the door   Ncounter: farmers market eggs Benedict (English muffin, ham, avocado, saut√©ed spinach, tomato, egg, hollandaise, country style hash browns) 7.50, side of fruit (pineapple, grapes, cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, oranges) 3. $13 out the door"}
{"text":"The OMG French Toast was OMG! Great service. Staff was attentive and knowledgeable. Definitely one of my top 5 breakfast/brunch experiences!"}
{"text":"Just went here yesterday for the first time. Got there around 8:45 and was quoted a 10 minute wait. That time was spot on. The waitress (can't remember her name) was wonderful. She was very helpful and upbeat. Tried the pancake flight as an \"appetizer\" and they were delicious! Perfect way to start the meal. Then had the Spuds Deluxe. It was very good, I just wish it had more of the fillings I chose and less potatoes, because the amounts were very unbalanced. Overall it was a good meal and a cool environment."}
{"text":"We popped in here for brunch on our most recent AZ adventure. Of course there was a long wait as others have mentioned, but they take your number and text you when your table is ready so you can mill about and shop at some places nearby is you wish. I love the retro d√©cor, so cute and made you feel like you were some where else. Our server was nice but generally MIA. One of the reasons I gave it 3 stars is that it seems things happen a bit out of order and some tables get served super fast & others seem to be in another time zone slow. Anyhow, I got the snooze spuds deluxe and my guy got the huevos rancheros. I wish the spuds were cooked more, they were soggy & oily and generally not very flavorful. For my 2 fillings I had avocado & pico de gallo, which helped add a little flavor. However, if I went back here I would not order this again. The huevos rancheros was alright, had more flavor than the spud dish. If we ever rolled through one of these places again I'd be willing to go, but would probably opt for one of the pancake or French toast dishes instead. I wasn't all too impressed with the egg dishes. Love the ambiance though!"}
{"text":"Good food but service to slow every time we have breakfast here!!the staff is ok I guess it's just lack of staff training!!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here this morning for the first time for Father's Day breakfast. I'm not sure if they are always this crowded (sounds like they are) but we were quoted at least a 75 minute wait time for a party of 4 at about 11 am... so be prepared to wait, because this place is POPULAR (and doesn't take reservations)!   I'm not going to talk too much about the food, because it was all absolutely fantastic. I don't think there is anything that you could order here that wouldn't be delicious- my personal favorite, however, was the pineapple upside down pancake that we ordered as \"dessert\"- I was disappointed that I was too full to eat the whole thing myself right then! The service was great, as well. Despite being packed to capacity, our food seemed to come out very quickly and was definitely still fresh!  We ate inside because of the weather, but there were quite a few people outside on the patio. I walked through the patio to get out to the parking lot though, and it was pretty miserably hot. It didn't look like they have misters, or if they do they weren't on. Any other time of the year I would suggest the lovely patio, but I recommend skipping it for the summer, unless you're into that sort of thing.  A special thanks to our server, Meghan. She truly helped to make Father's Day special for my dad!"}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the long lines and wanted to see what was up with the Snooze hype. I put my name down at 12pm on a Saturday and was told that there would be a 1.2 hour wait. We decided to go to Postino where there was no wait and delicious food. But I was still so curious about the popularity of Snooze. I kept myself on the waitlist and as we were closing out our check at Postino, I got a text from Snooze.  We decided that we were going to brunch hop and made our way over to Snooze. It was still heavily packed, but we got a really nice table outside next to the lawn games: corn hole, ping pong and mini golf. We were interested in the pancake flight and ordered the sweet potato pancake, the OMG French toast and the blueberry pancake.   Similar to the wait for getting a seat at Snooze, they definitely make you wait for your food. It took almost an hour since we placed our order for the food to arrive. Then we realized we didn't have silverware and we waited another 15 minutes for that. I understand that being busy means great business, but still! I think I ended up eating some of the pancakes with my fingers so it wouldn't get cold, cave person style.   The pancake flight was decent, but after waiting so long, I am now hesitant to return. The only really cool addition was Balloons by Tim who comes around to businesses to make balloon sculptures for kids of all ages. My sister loves Toad from Mario Brothers and he made one for me to give her. :)"}
{"text":"This is a ASU favorite  I went for the first time while moving my daughter back to ASU.  Had the pineapple upside pancakes, and WOW what an explosion of flavor.  Its a must to return.  Try it you wont regret it"}
{"text":"Second to none, as far as food and service goes. We've been visiting Snooze in Gilbert since their opening, and each time we're more in love with the food, the flavors, the attention to detail, the employees. They are constantly refreshing their menu. Ramon is by far the best manager, or human being all around... personable and fun and friendly and devoted to his customers, all become his friends, he knows you by name and makes you feel always welcome as if part of his own family. Best place to start your day is Snooze!!! Their benedicts are addicting, do yourself a favor and try a Benny Duo (so you can indulge in two amazing flavors!). And make sure to close out your meal with a delicious and scrumptious cinnamon pancake!"}
{"text":"I wanted to REALLY like this place and I just can't give it more than 3. The food was good. The Benny Goodman was awesome. French toast was alright. The wait time and service is what killed the experience. I told the seating hostess it was my husband's birthday and asked if they do anything for birthdays. She said yes of course and made a note. Our server didn't even acknowledge it was his birthday and he didn't get anything special . Next time we'll go to Black Bear. Bigger portions, less expensive, and much more laid back."}
{"text":"Came in here last Sunday around eleven knowing it was going to be a wait. I was quoted 45-60 minutes but I was prepared. I decided to hang out by the bar and wait for a spot to watch the football game. I've heard nothing but amazing reviews here and have been wanting to try Snooze for a long time.   I waited for about twenty minutes until two seats freed up for me and my girlfriend. We both ordered the Benny Duo and a Spicy Bloody Mary. I was craving a Bloody Mary all week and boy did snooze deliver. It was spicy enough to keep it interesting and I ordered two more! The food was out of this world good! Best breakfast in Arizona! I haven't had Benny's this good in Arizona EVER. We also had two bartenders who were clearly swamped with people but catered to us every few minutes. They were positive and cracking jokes with one another. Made it pleasant to be next to. They were amazing.   Highly recommend snooze!! I love the up beat music and the modern style. Definitely a hip place to take your date out for brunch. I preferred the bar area because the backyard seemed to be where all the kids were. No thanks! Will come back lots and lots more!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast at Snooze at ASU on Sunday and loved it! We shared the incredibly good 3-pancake flight with blueberry Danish, sweet potato, and chocolate choices. We added sides of perfect hash browns and extra-crispy bacon. Wow!   Our server was superb and Snooze has a nice buzz about it. We plan to go back with family and friends! Parking nearby was easy with meters along the street.   Snooze is one of the very best!"}
{"text":"I went in today with my friend for a late breakfast and it was so amazing!! I got the ham Benedict III and my friend got the breakfast pot pie and they were both amazingly delicious. Our server (can't remember her name but we were on the patio around 12 if that helps!) was fantastic. She brought me a hot toddy and it was presented in the cutest way I have ever seen. I can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"I loved everything about Snooze! The decor is amazing! The food was delicious! The waitstaff could not have been nicer."}
{"text":"AMAZING! They have almond milk for coffee!! Really great coffee and eats. Try the pancakes (cinnamon roll or sweet potato!) and their eggs are delicious. I love the presentation of their food as well. Great service and friendly staff. tends to have a long wait so try and go early or leave some time for a wait in your schedule."}
{"text":"Sunday AM brunch. As expected, super long wait - 65 minutes. We decided to grab a drink and wait by the bar- ended up finding seats after about 35-40 minutes. Now the food - excellent! It was busy so it took a very long time for it to come out, but totally worth it. I really appreciate that they let you do a duo for the Benedict. I couldn't decide between two different varieties and got one of each for the same price. We ordered French toast for dessert - now I've had my fair share of French toast, but this was by far the best. We usually order a half portion for dessert but decided on a full and boy, I'm glad we did because I downed pretty much the whole thing and my BF got like a bite or two...maybe. Usually not a food hog, but It was just that good.   Our bartender was super cool - she realized she made a regular mimosa instead of a pineapple one for someone and offered me the incorrect one instead of just spilling it.   Snooze was on our list of things to try when we visited Denver, but we didn't get the chance. I'm SO glad we were able to in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"First time here, and I will be back! Friendly service and great food! I ordered the Egg White Frittata, and it was great. More flaverful than anticipated because normally, items off the healthy menu give up flavor, but not this one! It was very light and tasty, with a very pleasant mixture of veggies! Nicely done, and I could see this becoming a regular addition to my routine!"}
{"text":"Went to Snooze this morning for brunch.  We figured it was a Wednesday at 10am; how busy could it be?  Very busy!!  We waited 25 minutes to be seated (were told 10-20 minute wait) and ordered coffee from the bar for the wait.  We had a cold brew, which came from a tap.  It was the color and had the taste of weak tea.  Not good!!  Then we got seated, the hostess was very sweet!!  We sat for almost 10 minutes before a server approached our table at all...from then, she was not very friendly.  The food was delicious!!  We each had the Benny Duo; me, the chilaquiles and summer squash; Ash the chilaquiles and the Bella, Bella, Benny.  All were sooooo good, perfectly cooked, soooooo good!!  We each had a grapefruit mimosa; I would definitely skip that next time though it does seem to be made w fresh fruit.  Overall, go for the food.  Not a place to go have a lot of drinks for brunch...family crowd, no specials.  Food, 5 Stars.  Drinks and service, 2 Stars."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've ever had. Everything is cooked to perfection and there is a great vibe and sense of team within the restaurant and it's service. Anytime I have company I take them here for delicious food and bloody Mary's or mimosas that are to die for. I would recommend this place to anyone and I can't wait for them to expand because I don't think I'll ever get enough of this place. Some of my favorites are the pot pie and Juan's tacos. I always add barbacoa and avacado to the tacos and ask for a side of the green chilli sauce. Also the OMG French toast is out if this world I always have to get a half order no matter how full I am. You can customize any order just how you want it without the servers being frustrated. It is actually encouraged and believe me anything is possible as long as your not in there when they are slammed. I've had them make me pancakes that have never been on the menu and it was hands down the best pancake of my life. The only reason this place has 4 start is because of the wait time. This place is worth the wait and if it wasn't great quality they wouldn't have 1-2 hour waits on the weekends. If you don't like that then go during the week or later in the day because that is the one thing they cannot control. I would also recommend sitting at the bar. You get great service no matter who is behind the bar and every barista that has taken care if me has been extremely personable which ices the cake for my personal experience."}
{"text":"We moved here about 3 1/2 months ago and I had been anxiously waiting to try Snooze. Everytime we were in downtown, it was either on a weekend when it's REALLY packed or in the evening when they're already closed. So, we planned a day to go and went on a Tuesday. There was no wait and we sat in the back patio. Ambience is nice inside & outside. Service was good but food was subpar and expensive considering it's just breakfast. I was so disappointed since we had been so excited to try it and it turned out to be nothing. I don't understand what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"won us over the first girls' brunch we had there. I am not even a pancake person but you better believe I get a pancake every single time I go. Don't forget to ask what the pancake of the day is!   They recently revamped their menu.. I know it was recent because I went a week ago and it happened in between then and Saturday morning. They added a ton of delicious stuff. I tried the caprese eggs benedict a little worried I made a terrible decision. Alas, the food came out and I did not make a terrible decision. The egg was cooked perfectly. Execution: flawless. Devour time: 4 min.   The only thing I hate is the wait time but I guess that is a good thing..for them. Always packed. They just implemented a new system to let you know your table is ready though; they text you which is great.. You can go walk around the shops while you wait.  Don't forget to try a beermosa."}
{"text":"Everyone was friendly, upbeat and vibrant; definitely great qualities for a breakfast/brunch place. The five of us were seated after only about 10minutes.   We ordered quite a variety of dishes and each one was perfect. I had the eggs benedict, i chose the bella bella benny. It was fantastic. We also had pancakes the peanut butter and the cinammon are absolutely delicious.  Our waiter checked on us several times without being overbearing. He was friendly and gave us suggestions when ordering.   They have a ping pong table in the patio for busy days and they serve coffee as you wait for your table. The menu has a variety of food choices from savory to sweet. I will definitely come back. :-)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast especially for the price.   Can be very easy so to beat the line try to get there early.   Everything on the menu is great but the sweet potato pancakes is awesome!  Pancake sampler is a great item which gives you the opportunity try multiple pancakes."}
{"text":"Another example of hipsters trying to elevate something simple and crapping it all up!   Started with an inability to make a simple mimosa.   They only have champagne on tap (the way all high end,  top quality champagne is distributed) and their dispenser was down.   It's called a split,  keep some in reserve.  Asked about the eggs benedict.   \"The menu states hollandaise is made with cheddar cheese.   Do you have just plain hollandaise sauce?\" The waitress replies,  \"Yes,  we have it with cream cheese in it instead.\" Face palm.   \"I'll just have an English muffin.\". This was barely toasted.   How can you screw up bread?   Boyfriend has ordered scrambled eggs,  arrived cold anda rubbery.   Wush I could give less than one star.  If over priced,  over doctored, frou frou breafkfast is what you seek,  its so-so but there are better places.  If down home breakfast is what you seek,  go to The Farmhouse across the street."}
{"text":"Breakfast lovers look no further! This is THE SPOT--especially if you're lucky enough to get Lyle as your server. Great vibes, great food, great service!! Thank you Snooze and Lyle!!"}
{"text":"yum, yummity, yum!   Take a step back into a Jetsons-style-60s-ish diner with amazing ambiance and great food! We we a table of 7 and EVERY one of us received our dishes in a very timely manner all the while staring each other's plates down with envy! There wasn't a single person who left with food remaining on their plate."}
{"text":"Sad to say that I used to love this place, but the food quality and service have taken a nose dive.  For starters, the waitress screwed up the food order. I've been in the food service industry for 20 years and trust me, folks will not think you're incompetent if you write their order down on a little notepad. They will, however, view you as a moron if you do not write it down and their food comes out incorrectly. She did not checkin with us to see if everything tasted great and the person who dropped the food off bolted away so quickly that we had not a chance of letting her know it was, in fact, not what we ordered. When the waitress finally dropped the check off, she again ran away, even though the debit card was sitting out on the table prior to her dropping the bill. We sat for 10 minutes waiting for her to return. She didn't. So, my boyfriend got up and interrupted her conversation with her fellow coworkers to have her run our card. Totally lame. Waiting tables is not rocket science. With so many other delicious options from establishments nearby that offer both quality service and food, we will not be returning. Bummer, snooze."}
{"text":"I got the Breakfast Pot Pie this morning. Couldn't find rosemary at all in the gravy and barely a hint of sausage. The pastry was really flaky so that was nice. I was surprised by how little it was for the price. Sorry Snooze, but you really fell asleep on this one."}
{"text":"Exceptional food. Service with a smile. Good folks....... Your typical down to earth Colorado folks. Came here on a recommendation from my inlaws from Colorado and will definitely be back. I had Bella Bella Benny which I recommend highly. Even had an exquisite presentation!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Scottsdale, Tempe, and Phoenix Camelback locations of this hip eatery.  Each time I have gone the service and the food have been consistently stellar.  Snooze does not shy away from custom creations or substitutions. This is refreshing because their policy ensures that you will get exactly what you want for breakfast/brunch.  If you are a breakfast traditionalist, try the Snooze Classic.  You will get a sampler of eggs, choice of meat, toast, and hash browns.  If you are more into pancakes, they feature a pancake of the day, such as coffee cake.  I highly recommend the sweet potato pancakes and the pineapple upside down pancakes.  Of course they do have delicious plain pancakes as well.  This place is always a win and will not disappoint."}
{"text":"If you are vegan the choices are limited. They do offer a tofu scramble that is very good. It is served with hashbrowns and toast. Other things on the menus that i saw was the porridge(i haven't tried that yet)."}
{"text":"Excellent service and eggs benedict! Travis the manager is the absolute best. He will give phenomenal recommendations. Come back again to order from the secret menu!"}
{"text":"Snooze is always a great place for the family. They have very good flavors of pancakes. I always recommend the pineapple pancake. They are a morning eatery. They get very packed on the weekends especially Saturday. The staff is very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast! We were here on vacation and made many stops at snooze! Definitely busy, especially on the weekends. Weekdays there usually was no wait, but on the weekend it was around a half hour. They do send you a text on your phone, so you can wander around the shops while you are waiting.  Their pancakes are the best! Very fluffy and the most interesting flavors! Cinnamon roll is a little different but I enjoyed it! My friend got the breakfast pot pie and loved it! If we are back in town we will be sure to come back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Brunch is the best, try the Michelada and Huevos Ranchos or the B.E.A.T. Sandwich. I'm not the biggest fan of bacon but theirs is heavenly, yes heavenly. You don't have to wait for a table, bar is open seating just slide on in :) Staff is phenomenal & food is delivered quickly. I try to make it here every weekend."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast food, the OMG French Toast is amazing as are the varied seasonal Eggs Benedicts. I like that they let you combine and pick one of two different ones on the same plate. Good coffee too. A little expensive for breakfast, but the quality and service are both excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing food in a fun environment! Will definitely be back. Wonderful service with Kevin, he was quick, attentive and very nice. Also best chai I've had in a long time"}
{"text":"This is a must when visiting Tucson! Reminds me of South Beach with all the Art Deco flavor. Pancakes, AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Despite waiting over an hour and half for this breakfast - lunch eatery, it did not put a damper on our appetite.  The staff were great... from the host to the server to the server assistant.  There was a friendly manager that walked throughout the restaurants to make sure each diner were enjoying not only the food but the dining experience.  The retro vibe was super fun!  We ordered the pancake trio (upside-down-pineapple, sweet potato & apple pie) and eggs benedict.  They let us order 1/2 Benny Goodman - smoked salmon & 1/2 Harvest - hearty greens & mushroom.  We felt like we had 5 different dishes.  The food was delicious with great fresh ingredients.  You definitely have to try their pancake of the day.  It's a new flaver every day, and they never repeat it.  Get there early on weekends, but it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Ok, Phoenix peeps, there will be a wait if you go peek hours.  I would recommend going before they close or early in the morning.  In addition, after reading the previous reviews, I believe people gave A-Ok reviews based on the wait.  However, if you break it down, this is a BREAKFAST restaurant that specializes in pancakes my taste buds have never tasted in my life.  It is popular and new, therefore, there will be a wait!  I wrote an awesome review about the location in San Diego, and I will say the quality and taste is just the same in Phoenix.  For those that have tasted better pancakes elsewhere, please tell me so I can try them.  On the other hand, their pineapple upside down and caramel apple pancakes are so sweet you think you were eating dessert.  All other pancakes shiver in its presence.  If you want a more thorough review, read up on my San Diego review.  However, they have amazing pancakes with a great selection of your traditional breakfast platters with a twist.  Check in, walk around and shop, enjoy your company, and feast on some great brunch at Snooze!  We will see you again Snooze!"}
{"text":"Everything is amazing here, the line is out the door but it's for a very valid reason. The food is 100, the service is great, I love everything about this place! They also give you free coffee while waiting! Definitely top contender for best breakfast in AZ, if not the best."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast here. We split several breakfasts here to see what's best. The big secret is that they offer half orders so if you want a half omelette and pancake you can! Omelette was perfectly cooked. Chilaquiles Benedict was immediately removed from the plate and ingested with fury. Breakfast tacos were a very generous portion as well. Blueberry Danish pancake, pineapple upside down pancake, and the pancake of the day was pumpkin. All outstanding but I think the blueberry was best. Coffee is delicious and strong. Check out the variety of bloody Mary's and mimosas."}
{"text":"I have eaten and have taken associates and colleagues to Snooze. Absolutely amazing menu, one of the few I can chose mostly any of the beautifully presented dishes. The staff is always aware of situations or conversations and will either engage with you, making for a joyous line of dialogue or quietly remove plates. I absolutely recommend this restaurant for a Tempe certified outing."}
{"text":"Bomb! Great food, great service! Went here for breakfast and got the snooze burrito.. It was a cool atmosphere and a great vibe. The servers are attentive to your needs and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow what a treat!  Extremely busy but the staff are attentive and have their act together. Always nice even under a lot of volume pressure.  The two meals we had here were truly outstanding. Perfectly poached farm eggs, home made corn beef hash and hollandaise.   Great staff, comfy bar stools, excellent food and a variety of beers and custom cocktails. Nothing more I could ask for except to open one up in Birmingham - I'm begging you!"}
{"text":"Days later and I'm still thinking about the delicious BEAT sandwich-bacon, egg, arugula and tomato plus avocado. On our girls trip to Phoenix, we had brunch twice at Snooze and it was great both times. Enjoyed a blueberry danish pancake to share. Friends had the breakfast burrito, corned beef hash and omelettes. Everything was good with a comfortable, fresh atmosphere and mature, attentive wait staff. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I wish all breakfast spots were this good. I'm a sucker for good benes and snooze could teach a class. The bloody Mary that went with it was so good, and lived up to the spicy order I placed. I went on a weekday morning and there was no wait, excellent service, and the waitress was attentive throughout the stay, even with the business agenda carrying on for awhile. I'll be back here any time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with Snooze! My go-to breakfast is always Chilaquiles Eggs Benedict along with a single Cinnamon Roll Pancake. You might need to share a little since it's a lot of food to get both. Always friendly service! Keep it up Snooze"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite hangouts for brunch or a late breakfast. There typically is a wait time so be prepared for that if you decide to check it out. Their bacon is out of this world and their flavored mimosas are delicious. I have been there several times and have yet to get anything that I haven't liked. Try the breakfast burrito or some of the flavored pancakes!"}
{"text":"Thank you SNOOZE! Food was delicious and service was fantastic! Atmosphere nails it with fun, light, bright, airy, retro with perfect combination of booths, tables and bar. Pineapple upside side down pancake was yummy and not too sweet, classic Ham Benedict with shaved hickory ham,perfectly poached eggs and hollandaise will bring us back again and again!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast place right down the street from us. We went on Easter Sunday so no surprise we had a wait. Sipped Bloody Mary's out front while waiting. Pretty good ones too. I got the spicy, not spicy enough for me but I am a pepper head. :-) After a less than expected wait we were seated and waited on. Good friendly fast service. Our server (can't remember her name now) was a lot of fun and super helpful on picking out our meals. Food came pretty quick and was as expected. Poached eggs where perfectly poached and the hollandaise sauces were great! Very good, good portions and reasonable prices. This place has plenty of seating, nice patio, and good environment. I have been to other breakfast places but this is our new favorite. Pretty impressed especially for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Snooze!!! What a fantastic place. Well worth the wait. Have been twice in the last three days. OMG French Toast is very well named. This morning tried the Pineapple Upside Down Pancake, Carrot Cake Pancake, Sweet Potato Pancake & Chocolate Pancake with Oats and White Chocolate chips. I CAN'T choose a favorite! The food rocks and the service is top notch. My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Very interesting interior, okay savory food, but delicious sweet dishes and coffee!  I went to Snoose this morning for a late brunch with a party of 7. The wait time for a table on a Saturday was not very long at all, although ultimately we were packed into a single booth. The service was by far the most disappointing aspect of this visit. She was not very friendly or attentive to our dining party. Often our coffee and water glasses would remain empty for extended periods of time. Not once did she come to our table to ask to see if our food orders were correct of if we needed anything else.  For the food itself, each of the savory dishes ordered were okay at best. I ordered the breakfast burrito, which was nothing special, but surprisingly spicy. The group shared a flight of sweet pancakes. These pancakes were the highlight of the dining experience. I would highly recommend ordering from the back of the menu when you come in for a visit."}
{"text":"I would give it a 5 star but it's just too dang loud in there. The ambiance is great but the atmosphere noise level is like a bar. You can barely hear one another while conversing. But the food is excellent. We got the upside down pineapple pancakes with cinnamon butter; it was phenomenal. I also got the standard eggs benedict ham Benedict the 3rd and added tomato and it was great. My husband got Havana daydreaming which was tasty! The homemade pickles rock, especially in my spicy bloody Mary that has habanero jalapeno infused vodka, it was delicious. I would say I'd like to go back but seriously the noise level was too much and we're middle-aged people. The hostess said that their least busy before 9 a.m. so maybe we will try again during that time. Our waitress was excellent"}
{"text":"I was SO excited when I saw Snooze opened in PHX. I've been to the Denver location a couple of times- it's trendy and fun, and has great bloody marys.   I went the first time during lunch, and got there at 11:15 so we didn't have to wait. I got the huevos rancheros, and it had no flavor at all. For the price of lunch/breakfast here, I really do expect everything to be top notch.   The next time we came made me officially take my stars to a 3. Actually, it would have been a two but the waitress (Brittany, maybe??) made up for it. Got  there at 11:40, and was told for a group of 3, it'd be 15 minutes. The hostess didn't greet me, and was not polite. Well, that wait turned into a little over thirty. I was about to walk away, when I got the text my table was ready. We go to the hostess, and she just leaves- although she knew who I was and that I had been waiting for a table, and cleans tables for a few minutes- SLOWLY, then sends someone else to take us to our table. I don't know what I did to her, but she was very rude and not helpful at all.   The \"chicken pot pie\" (that's not the name of it, but it's a similar dish) was very good and so was our server.   I will try to avoid this location at lunch, and I can't wait for the Gilbert one to try near my home."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, both on a weekend, both with a group of 4 or more. I highly recommend coming early to get your name in or just be aware there's going to be quite a wait. Both occasions it was over an hour. But is it worth it?? Yes! Breakfast food is my favorite & they know what they're doing. Nice portions, great flavors & if you have a sweet tooth, this is the place to be! They're kind of known for their amazing french toast & pancakes, at least among my friends. The atmosphere is causal & bright! It can get really loud which works well if you're in a group or have kids with you. & even though they're extremely busy, service seems to keep up! Once seated we didn't have to wait very long to get drinks or have our orders taken."}
{"text":"We haven't been here for awhile due to the infestation of dogs.  The dogs and flies on the patio are a mess. Pee stains everywhere. The service was slow but the food was good. Please have a section for dogs or none at all for those of us that are allergic."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with a group of friends today, and what a treat. Our servers, Jesse & Carleen were super attentive, cannot beat the customer service we received.  Travis greeted us and checked in several times to make sure all was good. The place was packed, but we  never felt rushed to order or eat. We must have timed it right, because there were no lines, but it did get completely filled.  The food was delicious, and definitely worth going back again. So many choices, and we did get to sample the pineapple pancakes, sweet potato pancake, and OMG French Toast. Will definitely go back and recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"It took a while for us to get seated, but we were there at peak time on a Sunday morning. They were great, texting us when our seats were ready. (We shopped in the meantime, because there were ample shopping choices nearby.)  The entire staff was solicitous, helpful, and the place was HOPPING. The atmosphere was very modern and hipster, but not overly so. Our server and the manager were both fantastic.  Most importantly, let's talk the food. It was outrageously great and uniformly impressive. As a table full of food bloggers, we ordered as many things as we decently could from the menu: spud stack deluxe, breakfast tacos, Bella! Bella! Benny, chilaquiles benny, a variety of pancakes, a hot chocolate, a hot chai, and other goodies. All were perfectly executed, impressive, and seriously lip-smacking. The price for our meal -huge and impressive as it was- was reasonable.  I highly recommend Snooze!"}
{"text":"Service is amazing and they are really nice about substitutions. I try to eat vegan and they made me and amazing veggie sandwich and even brought out the bacon on the side for my friends to enjoy! My only complaint is it's so crowded and has a notorious wait. Luckily they're a a Rack next door. Not bad for them though! Thanks guys and see you again soon."}
{"text":"Phoenix is doing breakfast the right way at Snooze! The menu offers something for everyone.    I had the eggs Benedict III. The cheese hollandaise sauce was out of this world. High points go to the hash browns. I am still thinking about them several days later.   My companion had a delicious omelette with the pineapple pancake that was to die for.   Great venue for casual or business breakfast meetings. With we had this in Portland!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! The corned beef hash is the best I've ever had hands down. The pancake flight has ruined most all other pancakes for me. It's TOO good. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"First time here! Overall a positive experience... Not sure I'd venture here with my little family of 4 (2 littles) all in tow during a weekend, but def for a weekday when it's less hectic and crowded!  Staff, inc hostess: quick, friendly, genuinely seem to enjoy their job. I asked for things and they got it quick, plus they were genuinely kind and sweet with my 3yo (he was very well behaved actually). When they screwed up our seating, they apologized, fixed it quickly and then tried a complimentary huge pancake for the table on the house. Very nice!  Wait on a Sat morning was quite long, as is to be expected, so no surprise there. The pancake they kindly offered us was ridiculously sweet... These aren't really horrible things, so, you can see it is a great breakfast option if you are looking for one."}
{"text":"I don't think this really lives up to the hype or the usual wait for that matter.  I went on a Friday so the wait wasn't too long so I definitely recommend avoiding the weekends. The food was okay but nothing to rave about.  My kids did however love it and ate all gone.  I'll go again since I only tried one thing but I'm not convinced yet."}
{"text":"I debated giving snooze three stars, but their pancakes are too damn good. The wait can be atrocious and they don't take reservations so come early or nurse your hangover at the bar or drink some coffee while you wait to get your brunch on. This is part of the huge trader joes/whole foods complex, though, so you could easily kill some time around there. Everything I've gotten here is delicious, especially the breakfast tacos and pancake sampler."}
{"text":"After arriving we got seated right away even though it appeared to be busy. We waited several min for a server but when she arrived she was attentive and took our order quickly. I asked for an iced tea and never received a refill (except of water) our food came out before our beverages from the bar. ( an mmm mmm mosa, and a dirty drunken chai) the bar tender /manager had gotten distracted but promptly brought our drinks and we were apologized to and it was taken off our bill. It was very nice and thoughtful of our wait. The food was well worth the wiat. I had a B.E.A.T sandwich it was delicious. The aoli was so flavorful the bread had a perfect crunch and the bacon cooked nicely. My hubby ordered the breakfast potpie  he said it was delicious, the crust was perfectly flakey and the sausage gravy full of flavor with a  nice, creamy texture. We were very pleased with our visit here the food was very good and the customer service was exceptional."}
{"text":"If you're planning on eating here for brunch on a Saturday or Sunday, then be prepared to wait. I've been here twice around that time and both times I've waited nearly an hour. In my opinion, there are some things here that are not worth waiting for like the omelette which is tiny and uninteresting. The eggs benedict, however, is fantastic. They have a few types of bennies and the veggie one I tried was delicious. If you have a sweet tooth for breakfast, they have massive sweet ooey gooey pancakes which come in flavors like cinnamon roll and chocolate peanut butter too that are bomb. Service here is excellent and the atmosphere is really cute- almost has a -1960s pop vibe. I would say that Snooze is definitely worth a visit depending on your taste in breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"I think I've become a master at avoiding lines. Perfect example was breakfast here. We came in waited 5 minutes and were seated.   30 minutes into the meal I notice all these people standing by the door, outside the door, around the door. Whoops we hurried and ate. There was a lot of peer pressure from those people waiting to hurry and eat. Needless to say get here before the 9am rush.   I still dream about their hash browns. They were crispy yet soft and flavor full yummy in my tummy. They're Bloody Mary was spot on too. If you glance to their bar you can see that they infuse their vodka right at home. Delicious and boozy!  I wanted to try their pancakes but pancakes and Bloody Mary yuck. So instead I had their pretzel breakfast sandwich which was quite delicious. My plate was wiped clean in 10 minutes or less. Which is not that healthy to eat that fast."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had been to the Snooze Eatery in Denver and said he loved it so seeing it was the last day of our vacation in Phoenix we decided to stop here for our last breakfast.   Everyone is super friendly, great service, love the atmosphere. Super retro decor and fun music.   The new manager stopped by to welcome us. So far, so good!!  Looking through the menu I wanted one of everything and I settled on the Late Harvest Benny. Sweet potato polenta, kale, sweet potatoes and a poached egg with cream cheese hollandaise sauce.   Coffee was good, water glasses always full, fantastic service. Too bad they don't have one closer to home!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both had work off yesterday, which happened to be a Monday (we typically don't have Mondays off so we wanted to take advantage!). Based on a quick Yelp search, we decided to try breakfast at Snooze. Being a Monday at 10:30, I didn't anticipate how busy this place would be! Granted, we are in a college town and in the thick of things at ASU where most students don't have a traditional schedule, but looking around there were people of all ages filling up the place. The wait was only about 10 minutes and while I would have loved to sit on their beautiful, tree-filled patio, we settled for a booth in the corner inside as we were both famished.   I decided to go with the 3 egg omelet and added avocado, garlic and tomato. This came with a choice of toast (I picked sour dough) and hash browns. The boyfriend had one of their several unique eggs benedict options, choosing the Chili Verde Benny. I can't speak for him entirely, but he cleaned his plate in under 10 minutes. The hashbrowns arrived in a neat stack and the presentation was almost as great as the meal itself. The ingredients were incredibly fresh and well prepared. I realize this is breakfast and not a gourmet dining experience, but it was certainly one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.   Being a Monday, I decided to dry-out and opted for coffee - although they had a lot of enticing breakfast cocktail items. My breakfast date was a little more adventurous and tried the \"Snooze Fashioned\": Cyrus Noble Bourbon, Cold Brewed Coffee, Cherry Shurb and Bitters, which he very much enjoyed!  Lest I forget, the service was pretty spot on as well. I believe our servers name was Flip. He seemed almost as excited about the place as we were, and that was refreshing! He offered suggestions for future visits and was fun/attentive without being at all overbearing.  Needless to say, we will definitely be back. A great spot to bring family or friends who might be visiting from out of town :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast at this place is fantastic!!!!! A wide variety of dishes with a pancake flight that is 2nd to none!  Their Nutella and banana pancakes are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write a good review because people in tempe haven't figured out how epically good snooze is yet. This is one of the best breakfast places you'll go to. Every single thing on the menu is out of this world, even the a la carte items. Try the hash browns but ask to add cheese...you're welcome! Plenty of seating, great coffee, lovely area...homer in every time.   PS if you have a hangover go here!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday at 10:00AM and had to wait 30 minutes. Honestly I don't get why. We sat at the bar and the service was slow. I ordered a Morning Dew which was suppose to have Snooze Sparkling, Fresh Honeydew Juice & St. Germain Liqueur. I did not see the first bubble. The drink was warm and it lacked flavor.  We waited about 20 minutes for the food and quite honestly it was just ok if that.  I have had so much better. The Corned Beef Hash was the best out of all of the dishes we had.  Bella! Bella! Benny was flavorless; don't  bother with the house hash browns they lack flavor as well. I wanted to try a pancake but was undecided so I let the bartender  surprise me. She picked the Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes which was...meh.  I almost felt it was a bit underdone.   In all the experience does not have me wanting to go back which is disappointing as I was looking forward to a great breakfast/lunch place.  I just do not get all the hype... everything was just mediocre."}
{"text":"This place is soooo yummy! I have been here twice and have not been disappointed. You really can't get anything wrong on the menu. The drinks are delicious too. The service is great along with the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"White chocolate coconut banana chip pancakes very decadent. And top that off with marscapone cream. Oooh yum!!!  And Liz was the best. Terrific server. Good luck to you"}
{"text":"Service was slow. I ordered Benedict Ham III or whatever they call their Eggs Benedict.  It came wish a side of hash browns. I found the presentation excellent but I took two issues with the meal. First, the ham was dry and didn't cut easily with a knife. Second, it was a little light on the hollandaise sauce, which makes or breaks the entire dish itself.  A co-worker ordered French Toast and side of bacon. Both were on point!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...bright & cheery, as a breakfast joint should be! They have gluten-free pancakes...score!! Staff were nice, but busy...no help with menu options, which would be nice for new-comers like me. Overall, excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Wow.  So my husband picked this place for the good-looking menu and because he and my son LOVE breakfast.  I'm more of a lunch person, but I'm a convert!  The service was EXCELLENT!  To start the culinary ecstasy we tried a cinnamon roll pancake with candied pecans and cinnamon butter...holy cow!  The pancake was the perfect texture, super hot and the whole combo was the best pancake I've ever had.  My husband doesn't care for pancakes and he was blown away.  My son had the pineapple upside-down pancake and it was insanely awesome!  I had the breakfast tacos with the most delicious green chili hollandaise sauce topped with fresh cilantro and bacon...made me a breakfast believer!  My husband had the Cuban breakfast sandwich that was everything he wanted and more!  We are driving, so couldn't experience the bar drinks, but definitely will next trip.  Great coffee drinks and the whole vibe of this place was friendly, customer-oriented and amazing!  Can't wait to come back!   Well worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Was in yesterday for brunch and am super dissapointed. I ordered the corned beef hash and what came out was a thin layer of burnt hashbrowns with an almost undetectable amount of hash. I expressed my concern to the server and she told me they were working on the recipe and would bring me out another side of hash. It came out about 10 mins later and was much better than what I originally recieved. I was charged for both my meal and the side which ended up costing over 15 dollars. I've been in the food service industry for 6 years and believe this situation was handled improperly. Definitly won't be returning and will be advising everyone to do the same."}
{"text":"I tried the omelet and it was excellent.  There was so much good stuff on the menu this place merits multiple trips just to try it all.  My wife got the blueberry pancakes and they looked to die for."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal, so I am very picky. Snooze didn't disappoint. After a short wait, 6 mins I was seated and my server was prompt at addressing my thirst! I read that the weekend wait is atrocious, so I visited on a Tuesday morning. The sweet potato pancake with ginger butter and pecans is a must try. Coffee is good and my omelet wasn't burned! You'd be surprises how many restaurants burn eggs.   See you soon Snooze!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite spot for breakfast!! I had the Caprese Benedict which was amazingly delicious!  That plate had ripe heirloom tomatoes tossed with pesto, served over mozzarella. It also comes with 2 poached eggs (caged free eggs) with cream cheese hollandaise on top of crispy toast. I'll definitely come back again to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"There are all sorts of not-that-important issues I could bring up, but I'll cut to the chase - our food took 40 minutes to get to us (omelet and tacos, nothing extravagant), and it was cold. They used the wrong cheese in my omelet, and the woman sitting next to us also received a goof-up on her order. The food wasn't impressive at all, and my friend's hot chocolate tasted like it was made from Nesquik, too! Definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We went here today for their \"soft opening\", since we work next door to the restaurant. 100% of the proceeds today went to St. Mary's Food Bank. What an incredible idea to get your staff trained and get people talking about your place!  We were greeted and seated within the first 3 minutes of entering the restaurant. Our waitresses (one was in training, and one was here from San Diego to help) were at our table very quickly and ready to tell us all about the place. Very friendly and helpful service! We were happy to listen as they told us that Snooze likes to use local ingredients, which was a huge plus!  They have a great variety of food items to choose from...I went with the Spuds Deluxe, which was a huge pile of hashbrowns cooked perfectly and topped with cheeses, scallions and two \"mixings\" of your choice. I chose wild mushrooms and bacon. Delicious! My coworkers enjoyed the pancake of the day (strawberry shortcake) and the breakfast burrito. I tasted both and they were amazing. ESPECIALLY the burrito. It was HUGE and tasty. The prices are also reasonable.   I'll save giving it a 5 star review until the hype wears off and they are open for awhile, but I have a feeling it's going to go nowhere but up. Very impressed. We will definitely go here again. Probably quite often!"}
{"text":"After having been to Snooze AM in Tempe twice, my verdict is that it leaves much to be desired.  The first experience I had was absolutely horrible. We waited for about half an hour and were seated on the patio. Although the weather was okay, it got hot really quick since there was absolutely no shade. There were dogs on the patio which is fine, but what did not sit well with me was that the waiters were picking them up and then delivering food to tables. The dog that was at the table right next to ours was small & not trained as he kept peeing on the ground. Like I said, one of the waitresses kept picking him up & playing with him while serving tables. Complete turnoff!  On top of that, the food we got wasn't impressive. My date got the breakfast burrito & I got the omelette with spinach, mushrooms, & cheese. I ordered white bread and not once, but twice, our waitress brought me sourdough! We aren't pleased with any of it.  The second time I went, it was with a large group & we opted to get a table inside. The wait time was horribly long but we knew that would most likely be the case. The service was spot on. Our waitress was great in getting us everything we needed, kept our cups refilled, etc. The food was much better. I got the Benny Duo with the Bella! Bella! Benny and the Benny Goodman which came with hash browns. The Benny's were just okay - the Bella was better than the other one, but the prosciutto has a weird taste as did the salmon lox. Keep in mine their hash browns aren't of the crispy variety.  I will have to give it up for the pancakes that we received to share! The Pineapple Upside Down Pancake was one of the best things I did ever have! There were chunks of pineapple cooked inside the pancake which was topped with a vanilla sauce & cinnamon butter. I would highly recommend this!!! If you're a fan of peanut butter, try the peanut butter cup pancake! The flight is really sweet so if you're looking for something a little bit less sweet, try the French toast!  I think I'll be returning to Snooze for the pancakes and perhaps the French toast .. But probably not this location."}
{"text":"I've been to this Snooze location a few times and had really good experiences! The first time I was part of a big group and the other times it was only me and one other person. Wait times were long in both instances but that was expected.  Each time, we've received good service & good food! We all really enjoyed the different eggs benny options and the pancakes too. My fianc√©s favorite one is the Winter Harvest Benny, and I personally like the Bella! Bella! Benny and the Benny Goodman. Our pancake favorites are the Pineapple Upside Down, Peanut Butter Cup, etc etc.  Overall, I'd be inclined to return to this location and recommend it!"}
{"text":"My friend and I popped in to Snooze around noon for a (very) late breakfast. There was a 30 minute wait, which we happily agreed to. They take your cell phone number and send you a text when your table is almost ready, so you can explore the local shops while you're waiting!  The atmosphere is awesome - very cool decor, super friendly staff, and an open-air concept. I loved everything about this place from the moment I saw it!   After our allotted wait time, we were seated at an outside table - which I was happy about because the weather was just beautiful! (And I don't get many outdoor eating opportunities in my part of the land this time of year.)  Our waiter was very friendly and helped us quickly. I started with a hot chocolate - my favorite! It was okay, but tasted kind of like warm chocolate milk. Looks delicious, though! ;)   I ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie with a Candy Apple Pancake instead of hashbrowns - great decision! The crust to the pot pie was lighter than I was expecting, which was a little bit of a bummer. But it was a nice compliment to the heavy gravy, which was delicious. The gravy has big chunks of sausage and is perfectly flavorful. And the sunny side up egg on top is the perfect touch!   It's funny to me they call the Candy Apple Pancake just that, because it's more an \"Apple Pie Pancake.\" Seriously so good, though! There were just the right amount of apples and topping, and the mascarpone was a perfect touch.   The two, plus the hot chocolate, had me more than full! (Which was good, because adding the pancake made it a little pricey.)   Another place I'd be a regular at if I lived around here! Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"It is amazing, the service is 5 stars. Huervos rancheros was amazing, so amazing. The server also brought over \"off the menu\" pancake. Tasted like cinnamon roll with bacon (tastes even better then it sounds) all choices on the menu are bursting with flavor, it will take you a while picking out something you want most! My new favorite place to go in the mornings. I'd like to give a shoutout to Angela, our server, she was one of the best and friendliest servers we had. I wish I could give it a higher rating then 5 stars to bring the average up because it deserves more then 4 stars."}
{"text":"Snooze was just what the Dr. ordered. Good food, good drinks and friendly staff.   This was my first time visiting Snooze and the choice of food was great! We ordered several items off the menu to test out and share. But we ended up ordering more!   My favorite though was the coffee. The mugs they serve in kept the coffee warm forever!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat! We go out of our way for a Snooze breakfast and sometimes lunch. It's the best treat for our family!"}
{"text":"First time here. Friendly staff and cool, retro decor (think Jetsons) and an interesting menu with some unique takes on breakfast and lunch standards.  Our Initial overall reaction was very positive, but almost immediately after sitting down it became apparent the restaurant is EXTREMELY NOISY (yes I'm yelling with ALL CAPS because in Snooze it's the only way to be heard). Why do restaurant designers decide to go all hard surface. We had to raise our voices, as did our server, just to ask questions and place our order. Really uncomfortable and virtually impossible to carry on a normal, relaxed conversation. FYI, it was mid-week late morning, so I'd hate to hear what it's like when really busy.   Giving them the benefit of the doubt, perhaps where we sat was the focal point and other locations in the restaurant will be a bit quieter. If you're bothered by high sound levels, be sure to come when Snooze isn't busy and/or ask for the quietest spot in the restaurant.  On the positive side, our server was excellent. Very friendly and helpful, taking her time explaining many of the dishes to us newbies and giving us some helpful suggestions.   The food was very tasty. I enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros and my wife had an Eggs Benny Duo of Chile Verde Benny and Chilaquiles Benedict.  Everything was hot and flavorful with a new twist on old standards,. While less food for the money and perhaps not as fulfilling as some of our other favorite places,  we'll definitely come back whenever we want something unique and different for breakfast as there are some fantastic sounding items on their menu we want to try. We were also impressed enough that we'll try them for lunch.   The only thing keeping us from making this a frequent place will be the extreme noise level. Perhaps when the weather cools off we'll ask for the patio, but then we'd miss out on all the neat retro decor. Ahhh... life is just full of sacrifices."}
{"text":"Random Yelp pick while on the road... Did not disappoint! Latt√© was average but food and service were amazing!"}
{"text":"We visited this place again on the weekend.  First let me say that I want to like this place!  It's loud and LOUD!  hard to have a conversation when its packed.  You sit so close to the table next to you so there is no privacy.  The first time we tried this place was not impressed at all.  Dirty tables, loud music from the kitchen competing with the loud music in the dining areas and food was cold and not at all good. This is expensive food for breakfast.  This time the food was better, not awesome but at least tasted good.  Still music from both dining room and kitchen trying to compete.  And still loud atmosphere.  If you go try to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Cool place in the heart of Tempe....a modern retro cafe that blew my socks off! It was packed on a Friday morning so we sat at the bar and got great service! My boyfriend had the Snooze Classic with chicken sausage and it was really flavorful. I ordered the Duo Benny's, one chili Verde and one chilaquiles. AMAZING! I have been raving about it for 2 days now! Our server also had a molten chocolate lava with pomegranate pancake brought out for us to try....so rich and so awesome! I'd pair that with a bottle of red wine! Would LOVE to go back!"}
{"text":"Oh.my.gosh. They have a pancake fight!  Unfortunately, I did not indulge in the flight this time around because I'm trying to watch my girlish figure. But I did have their 3 egg scramble with pulled pork, caramelized onions, and green chile sauce. It was seriously delicious.   Our server was on-point, and the entire atmosphere of the restaurant was super cute and retro. You can tell the owners put a lot of emphasis on the details.  One last note: They have a wall of windows on every side of the restaurant with bar seating, and every window opens completely! So on a nice, sunny 70 degree day it's absolutely beautiful to sit in these areas. Highly recommended!  If you go on a weekend day or holiday, plan on waiting at least 1 hour for your table - but don't worry, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Finally writing this review! Visited in January and being the pancake addict that I am, pretty obvious what I ordered.   Overall- Excellent presentation, great service and unique decor/clean restaurant.  Flight w/ sweet potato, pancake of the day (board was not changed) and cinnamon I think. Food came quickly but I realized POTD was not what the board said at the front of the store. No worries tho because my server said I could swap for any other pancake on the menu. (Or the OMG F. Toast)   Couldn't decide between the Nana's seasonal and the blueberry danish, so guess what? My server gave me both at no additional charge!! Score   Turns out those were my favorites anyway! Amazing flavors. My least favorite was the recommended sweet potato but will be back to try them all!!  Pancake addicts and aficionados must come and eat! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Food was awesome.  Nice clean restaurant with a friendly staff. Tv's mounted on the walls to watch sports and they also play cool music in the background. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Came here mid-week for a late breakfast early lunch, this place is always packed so I'm glad we came during the week. seated immediately, my husband had a classic breakfast.I had the classic eggs benedict,the waitress came to get our drink order, she gave us a look as if she was better than we are, gave us our drinks took our order and never saw her again until we were basically finished with our meals, my drink had been empty for a while. I think she realized that she ignored us and then started up a conversation right before we were ready to leave. too little too late, you would get 5 stars if it weren't for Jessica, your tip reflected your service. Poor."}
{"text":"I'm a mega breakfast fan and Snooze has piqued my interest especially after reading all the reviews. The food was delicious but the quantity was kind of small, at least for the eggs Benedict. I got the salmon eggs Benedict and was DELICIOUUUUS but small. The two eggs were on 3 inch pieces of bread and the hashbrowns served in this weird puck shape. The hashbrowns are delicious and I love the crispiness of it but the plate just looked so bare. I'm a person who eats with her eyes. I think it would do better if they added like a micro green salad on the side or something. It needs something to make the plate look more filled and be more substantial. My husband got the Barbocoa breakfast tacos and they were SUPREME!!!  All in all; this is a fantabulous place for breakfast or brunch! Would come back"}
{"text":"YUM.  When my fiance and I visited Denver, it seemed like the only breakfast place anyone was talking about was Snooze.  Then we found out they were opening one up in Phoenix.  We were VERY excited to try this place.  This is an outstanding breakfast restaurant.  Service is terrific.  The manager even threw in an extra pancake because he had to sit us at a table for 2, instead of at a bigger table.    The food is amazing.  I had the pancake flight and it was sooooo good! I recommend the pineapple upside down pancake hands-down.  Plus, they have a ping pong table.  AWESOME.  The only thing that isn't great is the wait.  On the weekend you have to be very lucky to avoid an hour wait.  They don't do any call-aheads or anything like that, so I would say just wait until you can go during the week to avoid the craziness.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Cute, great food. Easy in and out.  I had the burrito. It had a little to many black beans for me. I hope they start to validate parking.   I would go back if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth deliciousness!! Had the chilaquiles bene amazing and Mamosa everything fantastic"}
{"text":"Second review ever!!!  But it's only my second time to Snooze :)  Squid was awesome and the food was even better!!!"}
{"text":"This location is lacking in our experiences with Snooze. We've dined at 4 different ones in CO. This location had rank coffee, incorrect latte order, forgotten things in our order. We shan't return to this location regardless of the beautiful location and setting.   Step your game up Please. We love snooze but this was not snooze quality or level."}
{"text":"Snooze is a pretty good breakfast joint. This location is much better than the Arcadia one, in my opinion. There are lots of different options, including GF & veggie (soyrizo) entrees. The pancakes are 9/10; omelettes are 8/10; coffee is 6/10; alcoholic coffee drinks are 5/10 (not great). Service is 10/10, great experiences with servers here. First come, first serve .... so I recommend getting there early if it's Friday-Sunday."}
{"text":"Came in at 12:30 on a Saturday and the place was packed! It was a 30 minute wait for a party of 2 but was well worth it! I ordered the Benny Duo with Bella Bella Benny and the Chile Verde Benny. Both turned out fantastic, the poached eggs were perfect. I upgraded my hash brown to a pancake and went with the Blueberry Danish pancake. It was large and fluffy! They also have a good drink selection, I got a Brewmosa with my meal."}
{"text":"Snooze is an amazing twist on breakfast! Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and the service was excellent! If you do t get there early there will most definitely be a wait on the weekend. This location is nice because there is a lot of shopping nearby to kill the time along with games and huddles for the kids. They take your phone number and text you when your table is almost ready so you can come to hostess to get seated which is nice.  The food and atmosphere were great! We had the pancake of the day which were a Carmel flavor and the blueberry Danish pancakes which were both excellent. I definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"Cute ambiance, but the food and service did not match the exterior. Pancakes were dry and heavy. French toast was just average. Coffee was hot and delicious. Thankfully it was not crowded so there was no wait, but our server was not very attentive. She never came over to ask how our food was or to refill coffee... disappointing since it wasn't busy. I would go to other much better places in the area."}
{"text":"Went to Snooze the other day for my birthday breakfast and what a great experience... it was early because of other commitments that we had later that morning - like 7am, but it was moderately busy with no wait for a table.   The service was great with a very engaging gal who guided us through the menu and promised me no singing on my bday - which I appreciated.   I had the corned beef hash and my gal had a benedict combo which we really enjoyed. The mochas were a bit strong for our taste but perfectly acceptable.  We're a big breakfast couple and so I think we have found our new breakfast place... though timing is going to be key in coming here... If you're not timing it right, I expect it to have quite a wait with it's location, quality of food, and level of service."}
{"text":"This is an update to my earlier, less-than-complementary review of Snooze.  I was contacted by them and agreed to give them another try.  I met up today, with a pal, for coffee and catchup The place was quite busy at 10 am on a Tuesday.  I mentioned that to the hostess and asked to be seated in a quiet spot so was taken to the back of the restaurant.  She found a tiny table for 2, which was quite close to a big table of diners.  I asked if we could sit at the table for 4 right next to it and then noticed seating outside, so decided to move out there.  Our hostess was visibly annoyed by that.  Once we settled in, the service and food were fantastic.  My friend had a yummy-looking pancake and I had Rye toast with a side of Salmon.  Our server was very nice about letting us hang out for a good long while.  So, the long and short of Snooze?  GOOD: food, wait staff, pricing, ala carte options, location, parking, super-cute decor and menus.  Could be better: noise levels and the hostess ...both of these are easy fixes with some Emotional Intelligence training. and some serious sound-dampening efforts.    Our server DID mention that you were working on the wait times.  Still a deal breaker for me but I wish you the very best as you get it figured out.  Again, summer is almost upon us and your business is bound to suffer if you can't vastly reduce those times..  Thank you again for the opportunity to re-review, Snooze.  Keep working those kinks out!"}
{"text":"We loved snooze already but this visit made us life long customers! We go every year for my husband's birthday. Our waitress had a permanent smile and thoroughly seemed to love her job. Food is absolutely phenomenal! My husband is an amputee, injured retired US Marine, at the end of our meal we asked if they had a military discount, and of course they did :) when she returned with the receipts her manager had taken 50% off our entire meal instead of 10%! He thanked my husband for his service,as did our waitress, and wished him a happy birthday. What an awesome team of people and an amazing restaurant. We will be back for sure and recommend others go! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"One word..... BOMB!!!!  This place is so good.. The OMG french toast, the chilaqullas Benedict and everything was amazing... Very happy"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for brunch on a Friday. Full of ASU kids, naturally, but the staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. Awesome food (french toast and Candy Apple pancakes) including THE best bacon I have ever had. We will absolutely go again."}
{"text":"I love the OMG! french toast. But, I don't know if you should get it. I want you to be able to enjoy other french toasts in the future. I didn't even know what marscarpone was and now I won't ever forget it. Thanks Obama!"}
{"text":"Breakfast 2 days in a row, take out the 3rd day!!  Now that's saying something.  We recently visited another Snooze location in Del Mar, CA and were so disappointed that it wasn't anything like the Tempe location. College towns tend to have more lively staffs.  It was so evident in comparison where we could barely get our servers attention in CA.  This place has such fun, energetic, playful, happy servers that make your visit even more enjoyable.  They are attentive, team players and were knowledgeable of their menus and did a great job each day steering us into trying new things.  Definitely worth the wait. I loved the grilled grapefruit, the pancake flights, OMG their menu is so much fun for breakfast.  Not the same old same old breakfast fare. Pet friendly is always a bonus in our book."}
{"text":"Walk right in a grab a seat at the bar or high tops to save you a 30 minute wait.  Good food and the pancakes are bomb! Blueberry are hands down the best and grab a bloody buddy or mosa."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It's somewhere between a A-OK, and Yay I'm a fan.  I'd likely go back if in the area again.  Food was decent. and drinks were good and all was reasonably priced.    Nothing particularly stuck out, good or bad.  Our waitress was friendly, but not particularly engaging - fine.  All food was good and as described on menu.  i thought both of our benedicts could have been a little saucier, and my 'green chili holandaise' tasted neither like hollandaise nor green chili's.  It was both bland and scant.  However, the rest of the dish was fine, and tasty without the sauce - which was good, since the sauce, as mentioned, was both bland and scant.   We liked our drinks (Mmm Mmm Mimosas) and they were both reasonably priced and sized.   We were given a 30-45 minute wait for a table upon arrival and were seated in that time.  There's a service bar area where you can get a cocktail while you wait.  I'm assuming they serve coffee as well - but we don't do that, so i'm not sure.    They had the only decent/interesting looking breakfast menu in the central/down-town phoenix area - which is why we went.  While there was nothing wrong with the place, I suspect as more and more places of interest come to the area (as has been happening the last 10 years, and the last 5 especially), that they will have to step up  their game a bit to keep the crowds coming.  Anyway - we look forward to returning to phoenix again next winter to see what they and the area are offering. :)"}
{"text":"I came here when I was visiting AZ for the weekend. I ordered a pineapple mimosa and a half and half Eggs Benedict plate (one was smoked salmon and the other was carnitas I think??). They tasted just okay, and the portions were not very big, but that was fine.The prices were fair. The staff was incredibly friendly. The wait was long for Sunday brunch, which was expected. They have SoCal locations, if I give it another chance (not likely), I would order something else."}
{"text":"food ok and overpriced .. service good .. trendy place thats about it ... cute waitresses get 2 stars"}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome. Benadicts are unique and you can get 2 kinds if your unsure. Pancake flight is the way to go to experience 3 tastes at once. Service was good. They have an outside patio seating"}
{"text":"This was our second time at this restaurant/location. The first time the service was good. Today our service was STELLAR. Erica was our server & she just went above & beyond. She must've know that our wait was almost an hour (the food is worth it, trust me) and she was quick to get us our breakfast.  Check this place out next time you're in DT Gilbert."}
{"text":"Bangkok Bloody Mary, helping my recovery aches from the CrossFit Open 14.5 workout. They also let you split your eggs Benedict order so you can end up trying two kinds of their bennies. Super friendly staff, nice open environment with plenty of fresh air. Genius!"}
{"text":"Update: today we decided to give it another shot because there was no wait. Our waiter RC was a phenomenal waiter! He was helpful, informative and had a great attitude. We also had the balloon guy come to our table which was great because waiting with a 3 year old and 2 year old is hard. The food was great also. Glad they hired RC and changed my opinion about their staff."}
{"text":"Make sure you don't arrive earlier than the rest of your party, don't expect to have your morning coffee while you are waiting for the last person to arrive. THEY WON'T SEAT YOU!!!  So, if everyone can't be there early, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else, by the time your party arrives you will have to wait another 30 minutes or more because now all the tables are taken."}
{"text":"Tried the Gilbert location of Snooze this morning. Hostess passed us over for seating so our wait was super long. Why are all the new restaurants built without any sound absorbing material? It was so noisy inside the server couldn't even hear my order. I like that they have items on their menu that other restaurants don't, like corned beef hash and blueberry pancakes with lemon custard. Friendly and attentive server and meal overall was good. If I eat there again I'll sit on the patio...just too noisy inside. Who wants to have to yell to have a conversation? Coffee not very good either."}
{"text":"As residents of Denver we were really excited to share one of our favorite restaurants with our family while we were home for Christmas. This was absolutely the worst experience we've ever had at any Snooze location. Above all the service was terrible. Our waiter didn't bring us water and acted annoyed that we were there. Snooze has always stood out as having the friendliest and best service around. The waiter also knowingly got my order wrong and didn't change it or offer anything. At the Snooze in Denver they always bring you a free pancake for a long wait or messing up your order. The terrible service overshadowed the delicious food."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal and creative.  I would give a 5 star review for the FOOD, but it is getting a 3 due to the following.  We order 2 to 3 times per week from this Snooze, breakfast to go orders.  When ordering we ask for a couple of tweaks or add on's nothing complicated or unusual yet two out of three times the order is wrong.  They even read it back to you on the phone and manage to still get it wrong?  We have called and pointed it out, we have called and complained, makes no difference.  I am not sure if it is the kitchen messing it up or the hostess, also not sure why the orders are not checked for accuracy when they come out.  I know we are not the only ones as on several occasions we have ended up with other peoples entire order, or some thing in our bag we did not order or pay for meaning someone else's order is no doubt missing that.  I am about to call the manager as the order we just picked up.//// is wrong.  We are talking about 3 breakfasts, that's it, and they can't get It right?"}
{"text":"My first experience at a Snooze restaurant was at this location a couple years ago. Now that they have one in Gilbert, I typically go to that one.  However, when I am in the area or picking up my family at the airport, we shoot right up the 51 and come here. I was here last weekend and enjoyed our visit very much like the first. Very courteous servers, quick kitchen, and tasty food as always.  My favorite is the blueberry Danish pancakes.  They can get sweet after awhile, but it's amazing with the lemon zest filling."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Snooze, I thoroughly enjoy my experience. When I have family that comes from out of town we will always stop here for breakfast as well. It is conveniently located near me. Downtown Gilbert can get busy so I suggest getting there early! The only downside is that the wait staff is hit or miss. Most of the time we get exceptional service! But a few times we have gotten slow, casual service.  All depends on who's section your seated in. Overall though, I love this place! The food is amazing no matter what you order!"}
{"text":"WOW this place is amazing! Everything sounded delicious so it was very hard to make a choice. Their pancakes are some of the best I have ever had. They have unique flavors that seem exotic but are not hard to imagine how wonderful they would taste. The waitress was super helpful in letting me customize what I wanted. The coffee was excellent too. This is not a low cal place but it worth every calorie you eat!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, however we went in their today and they bartender was extremely rude. We attempted to sit at the bar to order drinks and possibly order food. There was three of us with only one open seat. We were told we'll don't linger too long because there are people who come in by theirselves and want to sit at a bar. There was still an open seat at the end of the bar. Guess they are too busy to get our business. Bartender screwed himself out of a nice tip. Last time we went ended up staying at bar. Thank you for being rude, you saved me money! Don't think I've ever left snooze for under $100."}
{"text":"OMG!! We had 4 different dishes the were out standing!! Seriously outrageously good food!!"}
{"text":"Happy with the food and service! Pancakes were delicious. When you don't know what you want or want more than one flavor, the flight is the best choice. The thing that threw me off was the wait. It was a hour long which I am ok with for a great place, but why was there several open tables and a few people hanging out at the front counter;  two were host and the others were servers, so I am confused on the management on a holiday Monday. Besides the mismanagement the food and our server was great! Cheers"}
{"text":"My wife found this place on our last day here Tempe. It was 6 minute drive from our  hotel. We went during brunch and had roughly a 35-45 min wait. They had complimentary coffee and allow you to go to the bar to get drinks while you wait but you cant sit at the bar as other patrons are eating there. The atmosphere is chill with a great outdoor patio with FUNCTIONAL MISTERS.   FOOD: We both ordered the same dish with only one difference. We had the Snooze Spud Deluxe with bacon and sausage. My wife has scrambled eggs and I had Poached Soft eggs (done well). Our server Nick was attentive and knowledgable about the menu. He asked us where we were from and we told him Texas. We told him that we were here for our 1 year anniversary. He allowed us to get the Sweet Potato Pancake on the house. OMG, that darn pancake was so Soft and buttery. IT LITERALLY MELTED IN OUR MOUTHS.   DRINKS: I had a Brewmosa which was delightful for an early morning kick off and my wife had a Mmm Mmm Mimosa which was a great classic one, kind of light on the champagne but still good none the less.  Next time we are in town we will be back"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! I took my family here this weekend since I had heard great things and they did not disappoint! Everything we tried was amazing. My dad has the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and actually loved eggs Benedict for the first time. My step mom and I shared and egg sandwich on a pretzel roll and the blueberry Dutch crunch pancakes! SO good!! Definitely would come back. Only reason not 5 stars is that the wait on the weekends is rediculous and I've tried to come 4 other times but didn't want to wait 75 min. So I recommend going early or during the week if you can!"}
{"text":"I've actually been to the original in Denver and it was one of the highlights of my trip so I was excited as hell to hear they had opened one near me in Tempe. Came on a Friday morning around 7am. Pretty empty since everyone around here is off to class or work. Sat at the bar. Service was excellent. Meagan was friendly and on top of her game. The rest of the staff was also very cheerful. Now onto the food, the orange juice is fresh squeezed and the coffee brewed to order which is not something to see a lot so that was a nice touch. I got my personal favorite, the OMG French Toast which was, you guessed it, OMFG GTFOH GOOD! Couldn't recommend it more. The sausage patty was a good taste, little bite to it that I liked. One day I'll try something else but it's gonna be hard venturing away from this French toast."}
{"text":"Best french toast I have ever had. Coconut. OMG FRENCH TOAST. Great service. Awesome atmosphere. We sat outside. Pet friendly. Would definitely come back. Long wait. But worth it."}
{"text":"Service was great. I had the strawberry fields pancakes and found them very enjoyable. My wife had the pot pie that used filo dough. It was very good although it could have been served a little warmer. The menu here offers some unique items. It is a little pricey but that doesn't seem to bother the crowd. We are looking forward to Snooze AM opening up in Gilbert. Two things kept it from getting 5 stars from me... the pot pie could have been warmer and prices are a tad high. We were pleased with our serving sizes for both items we ordered."}
{"text":"Yum!  All of the breakfast entr√©es were so creative that we wanted to try so many things. I ended up getting The veggie frittata and my daughter got the three different pancakes... Cinnamon roll was her favorite although all  of them were  good... And The option to make them gluten free made it  even better!"}
{"text":"If I could give it less than one star I would. Terrible service, tasteless food, and gunk in my drink. I've never been so unsatisfied with a meal to where I just don't want to eat it and leave hungry. Way over priced for the quality of the food. unless you're drunk and can tolerate any food don't go here."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. How they are able to stay so busy offering such a shit, overpriced menu is beyond me.  I hate breakfast, and I couldn't eat here; went because my girlfriend loves breakfast, so she chose to eat here. Their menu is like every stupidly hip breakfast place; the same dozen dishes with some different shit sprinkled on top. Might have settled on a sandwich, but you can't get a normal sandwich side (i.e. fries), because apparently that capability is beyond that of their kitchen. Nothing even remotely appealing for me.  She ordered some sort of egg benedict dish with tomatoes for a side. Thought that was an odd choice to make, much less be offered, but whatever. After looking at the pics of other people's food, it's a crapshoot as all the sides look pretty disappointing. Overpriced drinks and a crap selection of beers, too.  Her dish was pathetic. Two smallish eggs on two pieces of cocktail-party sized toasted rye, with 4 thin slices of a pithy, white tomato on the side. For $11.50. That's it... For $6 this would have been good value, for near double that, it was by-the-book wallet rape. She commented that everything was fine, but nothing better than what you would find at a breakfast buffet in Vegas.   Service was nothing special, and everything was slow. Slow to get drinks, slow to get food (nearly 20 minutes for 2 eggs!?!), slow to get the check. The place wasn't super slammed, either.   I guess some people are into this sort of experience and overpriced food. I'll just continue not wasting my time ever again."}
{"text":"Not the type to leave a review however I have visited Snooze once or twice a month for a little over a year. Was great then the manager left a couple months ago to open the Ahwatukee location (I was told by my waitress). My last few visits however have been a shit show. This place appears to be in chaos now. Just an entirely different atmosphere and experience since the change. Can't wait for the new location to open. It is quite a bit further but will be happy to make the trip."}
{"text":"One pancake will feed 2 people.  Super creative menu and a bunch of happy college kids eager to stuff your face with delicious bacon and eggs.  Their morning booze game is fantastic.  I mean someone seriously went out of their way to make sure your hair of the dog tastes good. I'd suggest you get their early and sit outside before that Tempe heat gets you.  Love this place."}
{"text":"They told us 60 minute wait.  When I checked 30 minutes into the wait they told me \"You are 30 minutes into your 85 minute wait\".  They said the same to another party behind us.  We left for Harlows"}
{"text":"MEH not sure why this spot is so hyped.  Came with a group of 7 on a wed before noon.  Spot wasn't too packed yet the service was SO SLOW. Servers acted like we were an inconvenience to them.  Food was ok, but nothing to write home about.  I ordered a la carte pancake( which was large) hash brown, and bacon.  Bacon was odd tasting and pancake lacked flavor.  Conscious of the group was mediocre food.  It's tempe there are TONS Of other restaurants I'd recommend over this one."}
{"text":"When we were seated, it took about 15 minutes and a sideways look at one of the waitresses to get someone to come see about us. Not a huge problem, but it did make our breakfast pit stop take a little longer than desired.  The food will not be the reason why we would go back (We probably will NOT go back regardless). Other than my mother throwing up after eating, the pancakes were soggy and I'm not sure which pancake was which. The tea was served in a glass instead of a mug (a little weird).  The atmosphere was nice. Airy and Chic. Especially if you love listening to every song the backstreet boys ever made while you eat."}
{"text":"I love this place and have been to the 2 San Diego locations.  This was my first time at this one but it might as well have been at any of them.    Excellent service, really attentive.  Food was great and came out fast.  My \"over light\" eggs were cooked to perfection and my order of \"not crispy\" bacon was just right.  Solid good coffee and real cream (maybe half and half).    I sat inside but the patio looked nice and had misters.  If you've never been to a Snooze, go, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Omg all I can say is YUM! Everything was soooo good. They have coffee in the front for anyone waiting for their table. We sat at a \"community table\" so we didn't have to wait to be seated. We ordered the ham Benedict, side of one pancake (massive), Bella Bella Benny, egg white omelet, coffee and hot cocoa. Service was good and food came out pretty fast Even though the place was packed. Best breakfast we have had out in a long, long time."}
{"text":"It's a very popular spot any day of the week. Complimentary coffee while you wait... Tip for snooze rookies, get the bacon and hash browns crispy, the classic is a great item and the bennies are also very good. Also try the 3rd St chai with almond milk (hot). Kudos to Alyssa was our server and she was very accommodating as the group is a high maintenance ordering bunch of gluten free waffle seekers."}
{"text":"Snooze was a nice brunch place, great to grab food or mimosas with friends or family.  Service - friendly, just anything you'd expect from a restaurant on a college campus  Price - reasonable, generally everything is about $10-$16 range  Food - mostly brunch items consisting of spuds, eggs, eggs Benedict, pancakes, quinoa bowls. I got the breakfast quinoa bowl which was extremely light, I finished in under 7 mins max. Sister got the spuds deluxe which she enjoyed."}
{"text":"Love this place for the food, the atmosphere, and the service.  Went in hungry for a traditional breakfast, but bailed on that nonsense in a hurry. They have a bunch of different egg benedict dishes and crazy pancake combinations that we just couldn't resist. We tried a pancake flight with the sweet potato, blueberry danish, and the swamp monster (Pancake of the Day). Then we did a combo order of the chilaquile and havana benedicts. I haven't eaten this much food in a long time, and it was all fantastic.  Elise was our server, and took just superb care of us, including answering my usual string of stupid questions about a new place and its food. Apparently the little \"sparkles\" that decorate everything there are called a \"compass\" and each letter stands for a different thing.   Even the mugs and flatware are quirky, and we loved it all. We will definitely be back when we finish digesting the breakfast we ate this morning... so maybe three months or so. Ooof!"}
{"text":"A little expensive, but you get what you pay for! The food is amazing and seems like every part of the meal is prepared with care. I've personally never had a problem being seated quickly, even in their busiest hours. Our waitress was attentive and once ordered, food came quickly. My glass was never completely empty and dishes were cleared in record time! I never felt rushed to leave either. Would definitely recommend especially if you are new to the area."}
{"text":"First time here & the rating is for what I ate not the service, which was good. I had a bowl of the oatmeal quinoa, love the combo. I passed on the candied walnuts & coconut that usually come with it & good thing cuz it was really sweet. Also comes with banana. $8 for a small bowl, kinda steep. Getting it already sweetened is like ordering coffee & it arrives with sugar already heaped in. Menu looks great & love they have booze too so I'll come back & try again but will order something different."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, from the moment you walk in they're happy and get you excited for your day! I've been to the Camelback and the Kierland locations and love love love it! I'd wait for a table no problem cause I know everything is great, the coffee mugs are my favorite, I have to buy one, they are pricey at $18 but hand made and one day I'll do it. The eggs Benedict's are amazing (all of them). There was a breakfast burrito that was great(can't remember the name) Honestly it's awesome, the music that is played is wonderful. Go check it out, relax and enjoy your morning at Snooze!!"}
{"text":"Not sure I get the hype. Food is definitely unique, but when it arrived, fell short of the \"wow\" factor. My boyfriends burrito was cold and the bean flavor was overwhelming. I'm sure they would have fixed it for us, but he ate it anyway. My hash was just okay. We did split and mix and match eggs benedict that was pretty freaking good. We sat at the bar and service was top notch, seriously great bartenders and delicious coffee cocktails. I'll be back for sure, but I'm not in LOVE yet or anything."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about snooze. The first time I went there was a 45 minute wait, but hey it was a busy Saturday morning and I was okay with that and the food was good and I overall had a good experience, the food was tasty, however then I went today (2/16/15) and it was a 15 minute wait, and then when I went in the hostess at the front said her partner would be back to seat us in a moment. After she said that, a new party came in and then the lady who came to seat us despite being told there are two parties only took the group that came in after us. When she returned another group had come in and the lady began prepping for that party to be seated (again ignoring us) and when the other person in my party asked about that she said in a snippy, rude tone \"yes, i just sent you a text!\" (she hadn't, we'd been waiting after having received the message that our table was ready for about 5-10 minutes) and then seated the second party to arrive after us. Then a different person took us to our table, finally. Ultimately, that woman (working at 10:30, who was seating people) was incredibly rude, and the experience was awful and we ended up leaving because that one person gave me such a horrible time. I truly hope this was an isolated experience and that she will learn some people skills. It's really sad because I had such a good experience the first time. We left and went to ncounter and enjoyed the rest of our day."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place. I always wanted to check it out, so today was the day. My Son & I came for brunch there was a 20 min wait but 2 seats at the bar was available and we were able to sit there. Which is great he got to watch teen titans go on the tv. He had the blueberry pancake with hash browns, fruit and lemonade. I had the OMG! French Toast with a raspberry sprite. Once I tasted the hash browns I had to have some too. The food was delicious and worth the amount and the staff was friendly and very social with us. The only downside is ASU parking next time we will take the light rail."}
{"text":"2nd time at snooze 1st time at this location. Staff was friendly to all the patrons. Food was delicious. My Aint had the B.E.A.T she lived it shed an extremely picky eater. I had the I Am Sam I love pretzel buns my hashbrowns were crispy as I requested. I am glad both locations have great customer service."}
{"text":"This was the best brunch experience while in Tempe, AZ.  The customer service and the food were outstanding.  The staff were so friendly, accommodating, and just great to interact with and watch work cohesively as a team in a clean, fun, and effervescent environment. My experience surpassed my expectations and was simply amazing.    SNOOZE Eatery offers a variety of pancakes and Eggs Benedict options.  There is a Pineapple Upside Down pancake, Butter Pecan Pancake, Southwest Eggs Benedict with shredded beef among other beautifully executed brunch items. On Sundays I am \"homesick\" for this restaurant and hope that they will open at least three metro accessible locations in the Washington, DC area.  I love you Snooze!"}
{"text":"I first learned about Snooze AM eatery while on a business trip to Denver.  The food and staff was amazing, so I had to try the local one in Phoenix.  The place was packed (which is a constant) and there were already several people waiting outside.  I took my new girlfriend with me and we were told it would be a 15 minute to1 hour wait. They took my phone number, so they could text me when our table was ready.  We got the text about 50 minutes later and we sat at a shaded table outside.  Our service was incredible and we were fully taken care of and serviced in a timely and friendly manner throughout the whole experience.   I ordered the OMG French Toast and it was wonderful as always (I have had it a couple of times now).  My girlfriend ordered the Chile Verde Benny (A woman after my heart!) which was also spectacular.  Even the house hash-browns were firmly crispy on the outside and delicious.  Seriously, how could you go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Retro meets modern twist on breakfast...where to start.. I arrived at 6.45, not realizing they open at 7am on the weekends, but the hostess was kind enough to open the doors early (which they did not have to do, even tho it was an unusual 35 degrees here in AZ)..I was actually going to have coffee & normally do not but it was an early morning.  Needless to say I did NOT have the coffee because as soon as I saw they offered loose leaf tea - sold...outside if a tea/coffee shop, how many restaurants offer loose leaf tea?...I also had AJ and was pleasantly surprised again that they brought unfiltered apple juice (bonus points in my book)...Withiut going into more detail than I already have, they have a variety of breakfast items but the specialty is pancakes even offering a custom variety order of 3 (thus u can get 3 different flavored pancakes), they didn't have banana pancakes on the menu, a bit bummed as I relayed that to the waitress but plenty of others to choose from...however after settling on a blueberry Danish pancake, the cook came out with a banana pancake drizzled with chocolate, caramel & powdered sugar! - extremely shocked and amazed that they made me A special pancake, which ease note that their \"large\" size pancakes are a meal in themselves-Delicious! You can also place HALF orders on almost any item on the menu, as I had a half order of the \"neat\" fen echo toast which was even better than the pancake....along with two eggs over easy and some rye toast, I always want more than I can eat....along with an extremely friendly, happy and informative wait staff, not overly or underly attentive...my only criticism is that I wish this place was closer to chandler! :)"}
{"text":"Great food awesome service and the drinks were banging. Bacon infused bourbon Bloody Mary who knew."}
{"text":"Nothing makes me happier than breakfast! This place is great! Food is amazing! Service is amazing. Paige is awesome. You'll be lucky to have her serve you! Being in the industry myself for 7+ years, I love it when when I leave ready to go back next weekend! Thanks for the experience y'all!"}
{"text":"I'm completely in LOVE with this place! I wish they would bring them to our hometown of NYC! No kidding... the service, the ambiance, the food, the coffee - everything was top notch at this place. I ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie with a chocolate chip pancake on the side. My husband got the Bella! Bella! Benny dish. Their menu is healthy and organic/free range where possible, which is very important to us. Soooo much better than IHOP, Denny's, Perkins or any other chain. We left feeling satisfied and light (not heavy & sleepy with indigestion). I'm just salivating remembering how delicious it was. It's a great place to have a reasonably priced breakfast if you are staying at the Royal Palms Resort & Spa like we were, or any place nearby. I would go to Phoenix just to eat here again, that's how much we liked it!"}
{"text":"Good food /friendly staff -I really appreciate that they serve coffee while u wait for your table when they are busy !"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today with my boyfriend & we have to say...this is probably one of our new favorite brunch spots. First off, wait is ridiculous. We arrived around 11:00am & wait was about 60-75 mins for 2 people...crazy! We put our name down & went on some errands. They'll text you 5 mins before your table is ready. I got the text, checked in & for some reason waited an additional 20 mins. Apparently they forgot about us so we asked to be seated at the bar. To make up for the wait they gave us a free giant caramel apple pie pancake...it was insanely yummy. I'm not a fan of Apple pie but I would order this pancake again. For cocktails we ordered the spicy Bloody Mary (with habanero & jalepeno infused vodka) & spicy gazpacho Bloody Mary (with cucumber, garlic & bell pepper infused vodka). Both were delicious! As for food, we ordered the chilaquiles Benedict & Bella Bella Benny Benedict (with proscuitto, arugula & balsamic glaze). Food & flavors were incredible! Everything on their food & drink menus are unique & there's a good variety of brunch items. The girls at the bars were super nice & attentive and the restaurant has a cool, hip, trendy vibe/atmosphere. Would definitely come back to try other brunch items & would recommend it to our friends...just have to keep in mind of the crazy wait time."}
{"text":"Yum! My new breakfast spot to go to. I give this place 4 stars not 5 because although the food was delish, the service was slacking and the music was on the extremely loud side which could be good if you have loud kids or are in a tired mood and need to be jolted out of your sleepiness.  They were closing at 2:30 so that could be the reason we had gotten the slacking service. Everyone seemed to be more focused on doing their side work and getting ready to leave.   I suggest ordering the pancake flight. It comes with 3 pancakes of your choice. I enjoyed the sweet potato and blueberry Danish. There's nothing else like these pancakes. Really flavorful and unique. You can get them gluten free as well."}
{"text":"A friend from out of town was visiting and staying in Tempe so we decided to come here for breakfast on a midweek day. Neither of us have ever been here, but my friend has heard about it in Colorado. We sat outside and it wasn't too noisy. We enjoyed the great fall weather. The service was quick. I ordered the corned beef hash and my friend had the snooze deluxe. We didn't get any drinks. The food was great and we both liked the layout of the place. The location is right in the center of ASU near \"A\" mountain so afterwards we went for a walk around campus. Overall, it's a place I'd consider coming back to again with others, but I'm not sure how busy they get on weekends."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great environment. Horrible music though. All you could hear was loud, deep, throbbing bass the whole time and it drove us nuts. Something a bit more melodious in the morning would be welcome. It's already a boisterous place, no need to add to the noise, Snooze. But again: GREAT food and service."}
{"text":"The food here is always awesome but my review is regarding the service that was provided. We came on a Sunday morning so of course, it was busy. The hostess told me it would be about 20-25 minutes but we only waited for 5 mintues which was a great. When we sat down, our awesome waitress, Kylie, took our order. Kylie was nothing short of a great person in general but also the best waitress we've ever had. She was ontop of everything and had a great personality. My family and i agreed that we will now always request her as our waitress! So to the manager of Snooze, you should definitely offer a life time supply of pinnaple pancakes and a beer on the house for Kylie for her exceptional service!"}
{"text":"This Colorado based company gets my five star marks. Service is fast, friendly, up front. The corporate office responds relatively quick to emails.  Food is everything expected, but keep in mind that their \"combos\" aren't what you'd expect at standard fare paces like at Village Inn or IHOP. If you're at Snooze, expect to have to a la carte a few things. This doesn't bother me at all, but I know for some potential customers this is a big deal, so I'm making sure I'm covering ground here with various, unique, customer expectations.  I discovered this particular location after visiting their Denver location in May 2016. This one is MUCH more spacious than the central Denver location.   Drinks are great, try their Snooze fashioned, which is bouron mixed with cold brewed coffee, mixed with some sours and some other stuff. Whatever it is, it's great pre-game for you breakfast fare.  Fun games outside. Now, here's the cool thing that is natural to the restaurant industry. You may have two restaurants that are the same brand, but culturally they can be so different! The Denver, CO location had hipster 20-something year olds playing hackey-sack type games just outside the restaurant on the city block sidewalk.  The Gilbert AZ location here? DOGS! Woof woof! No, seriously, dogs! And children. It's an interesting change of pace.  Would definitely come back here. And I have."}
{"text":"This Snooze AM Eatery was especially nice for me as I lived not too far away at Aura Apts (1920 E Indian School Road), so it was nice to take a quick drive and have garage parking readily available at the shopping center that Snooze is at.  The customer obsession with Snooze is real. I've never been to Snooze and not ran into a fully filled room of seated tables.  When I last came here, I ordered the corned beef hash, which is \"Snooze's signature shredded hash mixed with artisan corned beef, caramelized poblanos and onions. Topped with two eggs your style & toast or tortillas\" as advertised on their website. It was delicious! Savory eggs with just-the-right-salty corned beef with those somewhat sweet poblano peppers. Mm mm mm!  I also ordered a Mountain Mule, which at the time of this review is described as \"CapRock Organic Gin, Fever Tree Ginger Beer, Grapefruit juice, Fresh Lime & Agave Nectar\" according to their website.  Since I've moved to Rancho Cucamonga in California, I won't be as likely to come to this Snooze anymore, which makes me a little sad. Furthermore, the nearest Snooze to me is all the way in Costa Mesa, over 50 miles away in LA traffic! Womp womp womp.  BTW they have Wi-Fi here and it is fast even when the house is full."}
{"text":"This is what I ate/drank:  french toast, side of chorizo, cold brew coffee and a bloody mary.  I liked it lots.  My server was polite and efficient in carrying out his duties regarding the service of our food and busing.  But...he failed to defend my eating companion from a curious little wasp who was all up in her biz trying to sniff around the eggs and such.    NOT COOL MAN. DON'T MAKE ME WAVE AWAY A WASP; I DON'T LIKE THEM. That's it. I recommend it. The wait wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"The atmosphere for breakfast is fun and lively and the service is awesome, went here with some girlfriends. I love that they let you do pancake flights and can choose to try a couple of different eggs Benedict, great for those indecisive since the entire menu looks delicious! Same for the mimosas, they have various juice options or you can mix them, so many choices"}
{"text":"Simply OUTSTANDING !  Be sure to ask for Rachel - she's the BEST!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. The sinful pancake and breakfast tacos would probably be my last meal if I ever had to make a choice. It's always pretty busy, so it's okay when the kids let out an unexpected scream. Our server Christie was awesome. She was very good, always there with what we needed, but did not helicopter over the whole meal."}
{"text":"Great menu selection for food and drinks. Nice patio. Quality restaurant and innovative when compared to many of the other local restaurant choices."}
{"text":"I was so happy I finally got to try this place last week when I met up with a group of friends. I had a great first visit, and now I'm counting the days until a 2nd AZ location opens in downtown Gilbert.  Usually I automatically go for savory breakfast options, but the sweet choices looked so tempting. I finally handed my menu to my 9 month old dining companion, and she pointed to the benedict section. The late harvest benny was delicious, and unlike any other benedict I've ever had. Instead of english muffins, the perfectly poached eggs, goat cheese and swiss chard sat on top of polenta cakes. The cakes were on the smaller side which made them a nice portion size for me. Our group loved the hashbrowns on the side because they were very crisp and had plenty of pepper.   One friend got the pancake flight (blueberry, peanut butter and apple), and another got the OMG french toast. I was hoping to try a bit, but there was barely a morsel left when they were done.   I can't wait to go back although I'll still be torn between the sweet and savory choices. I checked with the company, and their ranchero and green chili sauces are all vegetarian."}
{"text":"First time to Snooze. We loved it. Got seat right away. Nice table. Good coffee. Hipster vibe. We are not hitters and still felt welcome.   I had basic french toast side of eggs and chicken sausage. I love the french toast. Tiny dollop of think homemade whip cream and a nice amount of fresh berries. Delicious! I didn't care for the chicken assuage. It was over spiced for my liking. The eggs were very good.   We went rushed. Took our time. It was great! We will be back."}
{"text":"The wait can be ridiculous, and in fact, the only times we've managed to eat here it's been at the bar. The food is DECADENT - you can't get better than this, but it's fancy breakfast foods for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town on business and arrived on an early AM flight.  Needless to say, we were starving and needed breakfast STAT!!  We looked up some places on Yelp and found Snooze.    When we arrived, we were seated right away, despite the amount of guests already waiting for a table.  Our server, Lolita, was pleasant, welcoming, and made some recommendations for us.  We ordered Eggs Benedict done two ways - you get to choose 2 different Egg Benedict off their menu.  I got the Ham Benedict and the Bella Bella Benny and my wife got the Bella Bella Benny and Chile Verde Benny.  Let me say, we were blown away!!!  The Bella Bella Benny had the right balance of acidic and savory favors.  And yes, the hollandaise was very creamy and light.  Poached eggs done to perfection.  We also had the coffee and doughnuts pancake and man, that expresso syrup with the cinnamon on the doughnut shaped pancake was the bomb.com.  You love coffee and doughnuts?  You will want to have this.  For real.  So the big surprise, was when another server came over to our table and dropped off an OMG French Toast, courtesy of our server, Lolita.  She said we've been great and wanted to have us try it.  My wife and I aren't big French Toast fans, but if there was a day to make us believers and French Toast fanatics, this was the day!!  OMG???  Yes, it earned every bit of its name.  It was fluffy and not overly sweet.  The marscapone, slices of strawberries, and the vanilla cream and salted caramel topping all just came together so beautifully.  We ate everything.  Ev-ery last bit of it.  Yum!!  We left this place with our stomachs and taste buds satisfied!!!  Great service (thank you Lolita!!!) and a nice atmosphere.  Highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had SO much trouble picking what to order. I ended up with the winter greens salad and added an egg on top. Super tasty! Even though they seemed packed, the wait wasn't very long, and the service was good."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've tried a snooze restaurant. The first was at their main location and the two Benedict's we ordered took around 45 minutes and then came out cold. I gave them the benefit of the doubt because they are always busy and the staff is friendly and the restaurant is just a cool setting.   We ate at the new Gilbert location this morning, came in around 10am and told us there was a 45 minute wait... No problem we expected it on a Saturday. They called us on time sat down and ordered 2 scrambles and a kids pancake, all three meals came out cold. We sent one back and they brought out a new dish in less than ten minutes.   They took it off the bill but this was the second time as snooze restaurant  brought us cold food, I mean how do you mess up eggs?  Anyway there are so many great restaurants in Gilbert this one needs to do a better job to attract and keep customers.   Next time we'll be going to Liberty Market, Postinos, or even lolos which is doing a better job since opening up."}
{"text":"I get the same thing every time pineapple upside down pancakes! Pancakes are a good size so unless you want a side you won't need one to be full. I've had bites of other items on the menu and everything is pretty good. Hash browns are very oniony just a heads up. I prefer the Gilbert location as it is less busy. Also they do not take reservations regardless of the situation. I wanted to have my birthday brunch here but they wouldn't allow me to reserve seating for 9 people as they said their seating is \"first come first served\"."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to convince myself to pay large amounts for breakfast... I mean its breakfast, generally a meal that seldom finds itself living up to your expectation, probably because its a meal that the average person can do well enough at home. With that being said Snooze is worth every penny. The food is excellent and the creative pancake options are to die for. Its easy to find yourself eating a lot here because the portions are a great size and its also hard to pass up trying things like pineapple upside down pancakes. This place is great, the music tends to be a bit much and often way too loud to deal with early in the morning for me, but the food is worth the discomfort. The menu could be a little cheaper considering but I love this place."}
{"text":"Prepare for a rave review! Found it on Yelp and almost 500 reviews don't lie! Uhmahzing! Seriously I want to give this place 10 stars. Don't be scared by the 45-60 minute wait time. We were told that and had a table in 25 minutes. It gave us time to kick back on the sunny patio to enjoy some wonderfully inventive breakfast cocktails like the brewmosa, michelada, as well as five different versions of Bloody Mary and mimosas.   Our group had chilaquiles Benedict, ham Benedict and breakfast tacos. And you bet we added a blueberry pancake and peanut butter cup pancake. Everything was fresh and fantastic. I also recommend a side of smokey thick cut bacon.   Service was great. 80s music and clean diner decor gave Snooze a great hip vibe. The place is our new fave in Phoenix and we just may be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast the puff pasty pie looks amazing and the waffles are amazing as well I had the eggs Benedict and they were great just wish the lines were better may take over an hour to get a table"}
{"text":"My family and I came here just to try out a new place. My husband got a burrito and said it was the best he's ever had. I got the breakfast pot pie and thought it was really good. The wait for 2 adults and a 2yr old was about 25mins, it was packed! But I think the wait was worth it. If you have little kids coming with inform them because they do have high top seating. The lady seating us was a little worried about our kid sitting up so high, which was nice because nowadays people tend not to care at all. But we told her it was okay and so that's where we sat and it worked out fine but just a small tip for parents because we didn't realize this and it helps them find appropriate seating for you. Our waiter was a young man who was really nice and answered any questions we had. When we asked for some time to look at the menu he didn't just pop in every 2-3 mins bugging us which was nice. He was very busy with several other tables but he made sure to be attentive to us as well. The food is supposed to be on the healthier side, they use cage free eggs and natural ingredients. Definitely would go back and bring the family when they come visit."}
{"text":"Literally would come here every Sunday! I am never disappointed in my order and absolutely love the staff. Everyone is so nice and it has such an amazing vibe. All the staff is dressed super chill and that makes it so much more comfortable than most places. Definitely recommend going here for a good breakfast! Get there early though! It's ALWAYS busy! There's a reason for it obviously"}
{"text":"Hype around this restaurant exceeds its execution. Food was either over cooked,under cooked or barely warm. For the price you need to deliver, and it just doesn't. Skip this one."}
{"text":"Were visiting from LA and decided to eat here based on the plethora of reviews. Everything we ate was impressive, delicious and satisfying. Even our toddler stuffed her face! The ambiance is relaxed and casual even though its packed. Don't think just eat!!"}
{"text":"I love my eggs Benedict! In fact, it's the only breakfast food I eat. Theirs.... Are superrrrrrb!   I also got the hot chocolate, but it tasted like milk with nesquick. Meh! And our waitress kinda sucked."}
{"text":"The OMG! french toast was the BEST french toast that i've ever had in my life!!!! It's a must try. Everything was absolutely wonderful. Friendly service from the host and at the bar with a beautiful atmosphere. I can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"Love the mimosas here and the service is amazing- my server, Heather, is awesome and super friendly. Thank you. Oh, food was great as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing is the only word for this place. My husband and I have been there twice now and both times everything we got was fantastic!  It's not only the food, the hostess and servers are outstanding also. You're cheating yourself if you don't try this place!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and our server was awesome, but the wait was long and the food was really only decent.  I was expecting higher quality and more flavor.  I ordered the corn beef hash with poached eggs.  The hash came out blackened and bland.  The poached eggs were hard cooked rather than runny - the server brought me the correctly cooked eggs very quickly - props to her!  Like Jensen M who wrote a review on the same day, our wait was really long, not just the wait to be seated, but the wait for our food.  We waited more than 45 minutes just for the food.  The manager stopped by to thank us for being patient.  He said he had been keeping an eye on us.  That was cool. I could tell he had been \"keeping an eye\" on most of the tables in the restaurant as we all were waiting a really long time for our food.  I have worked in a restaurant and understand that some days are difficult, especially during the first month of being open.  I would try the place again.  I definitely would come back for the chai!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The flight of pancakes was amazing! I can't wait to go back and try the breakfast pot pie!"}
{"text":"You would be stupid to not eat here! Wait times are long, very long at times, but worth the wait! Enjoy some free coffee or hit the rack while you wait! My favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"My wife and I both love this place, we go here once a month or more.  Amazing food"}
{"text":"Unbelievable and incredible breakfast. We love the Benny Goodman which includes salmon, eggs and a special source on rye toast. The gluten free hotcakes are to die for. Give yourself a little time as the wait is often 30 to 45 min. Well worth the wait. Put this place on your breakfast bucket list."}
{"text":"Came in here for bunch on Monday before my flight and I loved it! So happy to learn there are locations in California too (even though they're in SD, boo). The decor is super cute and has a hip, colorful Jetsons diner feel. I wish I had a bigger appetite so I could try more, but I had:  Breakfast Pot Pie: I expected this to be more like a chicken pot pie in presentation, but it's basically the top of a chicken pot pie with the gravy and an egg on top. The pastry is super flakey and delicious, as is the gravy. It's not a lot of substance, but it's still filling!  Pineapple Upside-Down Pancake: So glad I tried this too - probably the best pancake I've ever had. The actual pancake texture was perfect and the pineapple chunks and brown butter were an incredible complement to it. I'm ready to go back for more of this...  The boozy breakfast cocktails looked amazing too. If I weren't driving, I'd have tried a few. I wish there were more places like this in NorCal (and open super late). It's the perfect blend of traditional late-night diner and experimental hipster cafe. Yes please."}
{"text":"FOOD: I had pineapple upside down pancakes with a side of bacon. Wow. It exceeded my expectations. The pancakes had gooey pineapples mixed into the batter. It was finished with a generous drizzle of cream cheese frosting, and a pat of cinnamon butter on top.  My partner had the Cocoa Pancakes with a seared marshmallow on top, and a side of melted chocolate (in lieu of syrup). He loved it. He also ordered a beautuful side of fruit which looked fresh.   DRINKS: I started with a cherry mimosa-like drink which was ok, but the Bloody Mary was very tasty. It had a nice amount of spice. He started with a grapefruit mimosa and finished with a different mixed drink that he appeared to enjoy.  SERVICE: Attentive, accurate, friendly, and prompt.  PARKING: A parking garage which is $3 an hour is just steps away. I don't know if weekends are always free, but it was free when we visited.  We dined during what, presumably, is one of their busiest periods (Sunday Brunch). Everything was spot-on. We're definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Establishment is great to eat at. Service from every employee was outstanding. The food was quite refreshing and extremely flavorful.  Absolutely tube thumbs up no question about it."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast place! You can't go wrong here! I couldn't decide which Benedict I wanted and they let me mix and match them. Delicious! Mom had the French toast and was kind enough to share a bite. That was amazing too!!!!    They have great coffee and loose leaf teas (my favorite).   Highly recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"We've eaten at the Snooze in Scottsdale several times and the service was always great as was the food but unfortunately our server was having either a bad day or was smoking something.  Our order was off and ice cold and he didn't check-in for close to 20 mns so we ate it anyways.  Giving a 3 stars because I know how good the food should be."}
{"text":"First time at snooze this morning and it was excellent!  We had Kate as our waitress, she was sweet, prompt and knowledgable!  I tried the eggs Benedict, one with salmon the other had pork and green chili, both were excellent!!  We had a party of four and everyone enjoyed their meal and we all left satisfied.  Definitely going to be back again!  Only thing that could have improved our experience would have been a misting system on the patio!  We opt out of the wait by getting seated immediately on the patio..  It was covered which was nice, but a misting system would have made it that much more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Our server was friendly and checked on us an appropriate amount of times. Food didn't take long to come and was nice and hot."}
{"text":"A little expensive but the food is great and the staff is nice. The place is sometimes a little overwhelmed and the staff can forget about you and they take a while to clean up, then again I did go less than an hour before closing.  I paid $4 for a glass of cranberry juice, no refills :( I think the food is a little overpriced but it filled me up and I would go again"}
{"text":"The perfect breakfast place with an amazing staff and the food comes out quick!! The Harvest Benny is the business."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast at snooze. I have been stalking this place for months so you could say I was pretty excited. It did not disappoint! I had the pancake flight which was amazing!!! The blueberry Danish and strawberry shortcake were so fresh and full of flavor, it was like dessert for breakfast. My husband had the Benny duo with the Bella Bella and the Benny goodman which he loved. The eggs were perfectly poached. My son's kid's plate was pretty impressive. It came with fresh fruit and a mini version of the hash browns. Our server Arianna was great! Super attentive and on the ball. All in all it was everything we were hoping for and more."}
{"text":"I love a good breakfast on Sunday morning.  Too bad the wait was too long.  Maybe next time, Snooze."}
{"text":"5 stars on the food and only one star for the service.  After our food was delivered it was impossible to get attention for coffee refills or items wanted (tabasco).  The decor is five stars.  It is a 1950's throw back ambiance. There is nothing to buffer the sound so 'ya gotta speak loudly to be heard.  There is good offering on the menu.  The omelet with 3 items was great.  One person in our group got the hash (yuck) but he was an aficionado & loved it.  All of our entrees were great.  We arrived at 8:30 on a Saturday morning and there was no wait.  However, when we left 1.5 hours later there was a huge waiting line. (They open @ 6:30 am.)  Tip: If you have more than four in your party you might go elsewhere.    Tip for the management: If you have more attentive servers you'll speed along the dining and cut down the waiting time for other patrons.  Also, the manager should float around asking if everything is ok.  Or, at least have the servers check with the customer a couple of minutes after serving to see if all is ok."}
{"text":"Went out of our way to go here. We were seated quickly and the menu had a lot of good options. However, after waiting for service for 20 minutes we decided to go try another local place."}
{"text":"This place had some pretty yummy breakfast. We were starving and happened to land here.  My goal was to find delicious and hearty breakfast and I got exactly that. I couldn't even finish it because it was so huge. I got the Snooze classic with pulled pork, chicken, hash browns, eggs over medium and coffee. Wow! Most delicious thing you could eat if you were starving! Goal accomplished indeed."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying that I am an egg Benedict nerd.  I love nothing more than a perfectly poached egg and a solid hollandaise, any flavor hollandaise for that matter as long as it is rich, creamy, and made from scratch.  Snooze has got it!! 6 different types of Benedict!! I was in heaven!  My fianc√© had the corned beef hash which was more corned beef than hash which I greatly appreciated.  The gazpacho Bloody Mary and Bangkok Bloody Mary were awesome, great house Bloody Mary mix and you call it vodka.  Did I mention that I am a Bloody Mary nerd as well!! All around solid place. The atmosphere is retro hip yet still being a very comfortable environment.  I will have many more visits here. I left one star out for the service.  It was not incredibly attentive but not unfriendly."}
{"text":"This is hands down delicious every time.  Their eggs Benedict is amazing, and the coffee and cocktails are smooth and tasty."}
{"text":"A new hidden treasure in Tempe. Just look at the menu, read it and when that question comes up \"Could this really be as good as it sounds?\" The answer is totally YES! So worth spending an hour to find a place around here worth going to for breakfast. Not an easy task I might add. Normally I don't mention anyone but the \"bartender/waitress\" that helped me was very knowledgable and as excited to tell me about their menu as I was to try it. It made my indecisive self make a clear choice based off of her recommendation which was honest and so correct!   Breakfast Tacos with Barbacoa. Not something I would normally order and something I have never had. So good!  Reasonably priced high quality food with competent and friendly staff. Not much else to ask for."}
{"text":"The customer service once again is exceptional. Today we had breakfast pot pie and the chiliquillas Benedict. Delish!  The potatoes were off for some reason today. Not sure why,  but our server/mgr everything he could to make it right."}
{"text":"I went with a friend on Saturday morning before 8 am. It was busy when we got there so we sat at the bar. I had the chilaquiles benedict which was awesome! It had so much flavor. The poblano hollandaise had a few really hot bites but the rest were tolerable (I'm a wimp with spicy hot). The only thing I didn't care for was the hash browns. I like mine crispy. These had a brown layer on top and the rest was like eating boiled potatoes. My friend and I shared a blueberry pancake. My friend is very particular about pancakes and she liked them. She says that most restaurant pancakes taste like the are made from bisquick, which these didn't. They are also very generous with the blueberries, which are wild. (wild berries are small in size and more flavorful) My friend had the green eggs and ham (green=spinach). The ham looked like real sliced ham, not the deli stuff or canadian bacon. She liked it. We both said we would return. There are some other dishes we want to try. The place was clean. The stools at the bar were comfortable, usually they aren't. The place is loud though, but so is every restaurant in that downtown Gilbert area. They have high open ceilings and no carpet so everything is amplified. I did not use the restroom so I cannot say if they were clean. Our server was friendly and even though she was the only server at the bar, she did a great job."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in my visit. I usually go to the location in Phoenix and was excited they opened up a closer store!  Order a 3 egg scramble with bacon and avo. It was SO greasy with so much thick \"bacon\" in my eggs. It was entirely over powering. The pancake was good but over cooked.  I probably won't go back for a long while after that experience."}
{"text":"Food was great!  Love the ambience.  Music is a little too loud... especially if we can't hear each other while sitting next to each other.  A little on the pricey side.  Service. s u c k e d! Once food was delivered, server never came to check on us again. Had to wave down someone for our check. Perhaps the server was having an off day?"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious brunch on the patio basking in the sun and greatly enjoyed French toast and Benedict's. Everything our table ordered had was amazing! Our server went above and beyond as we didn't have any pancakes and she ordered one for us to try! Such hospitality!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here by myself on a Sunday  and would normally sit at the bar but it was packed.  Sat at a table and waited at least 15 minutes for someone to come by. Server was very nice but seemed over whelmed. I ordered a 3 egg scramble with cheese,  chiles, & spinach & hash browns well done   After waiting another 20 minutes food came and there was more cheese than egg & hash browns were raw. It seems like they use liquid or powdered eggs. Had to flag down someone for hot sauce. Another 15-20 minutes later the very nice server came back to check on me. I asked for another mimosa & mentioned about hash browns and was very apologetic and brought me some well done but I was already done. I will give them another try but I hope management reads the reviews and works out the kinks otherwise they will lose my business."}
{"text":"Sorry Colorado- the best Snooze location is in Tempe!  I've been to four different locations, including Denver- and the Tempe location crushes all the rest. The building is just beautiful- a ton of thought and money went into making such a comfortable, bright, and airy restaurant. We all know mornings can be rough- so why not have breakfast at an amazing place?  Snooze Tempe is home to some of the best restaurants professionals I've ever encountered. In the last two visits- Flip & Starchild were amazing servers. Friendly and helpful- and just totally on point. Today I was having s friendly debate with my sister and her friend. They had never had the pineapple upside down pineapple pancake- so I was trying to tell them how epic it was. Starchild helped us settle this debate by bringing out a pineapple pancake which was just delicious.   In closing- this place is wonderful. There WILL be a line on the weekends. Just know that in advance. Craig breakfast spots don't have a line- do if you can't wait for amazing food and greet service- just hit up the nearest Denny's and let your taste buds become depressed. Otherwise check out Tempe Snooze and start your day out in the best possible way."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here for breakfast it was sooo good! He had the shrimp and grits and it was divine. The mimosa are soo good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best eggs Bennies choices and flavors I have found. Great service great breakfast get here early. Always make it a stop in Arizona."}
{"text":"I had been to Snooze in Boulder, CO and fell in love, so when they opened one here I was shocked! I love the atmosphere and the staff are always friendly. I've had the Sandwich I Am, the Breakfast Burrito and the heaping mound of hash browns and cheese that you get to add toppings to ( I chose chorizo and onion). Every item I have been thoroughly impressed with. So good.  The only downfall to this place is they need to expand or open more locations because the wait time is ridiculous, even on weekdays. But, I guess that just shows how good the food is. Also, a huge disappointment for me is their coffee! How can you have such delicious food and such terrible coffee? They even have a great back story to the coffee and it still tastes bad. The location In boulder had good coffee so I'm not sure where the disconnect is."}
{"text":"Anywhere you can go to and get a brew and a........breakfast pot pie......????? at 6:00am is my kinda joint. Now look, you don't go here to get crunk and load up on the sauce........but you go here to begin your journey to pure black out bliss by 2:00PM on any Saturday. I am a fan of anywhere that has down to earth servers and fire pits in the front yard. If you're creeping in the area or just looking to get nice at a chill spot......get on your horse and ride."}
{"text":"The food here is always a solid choice you really can't go wrong. the healthy menu items like the egg white frittata and omelette are packed with flavor and much tastier than most restaurants \"healthy option\". they also have pancake flights which are fun to split with a friend and have a little taste of some of their most popular pancakes. They've got great breakfast drinks also-all sorts of flavored mimosas and a breakfast twist on classics like margaritas etc."}
{"text":"The most amazing food,  staff and experience.  I didn't grab pictures.  But this place is truly incredible and unique. Got the Benedict in which you can pick two types.  So awesome."}
{"text":"I have only eaten at Snooze (Gilbert) twice, and obviously have not tried everything on their menu, but I can tell you that my ordered \"over medium\" eggs were most definitely over easy with nearly liquid yokes and runny egg whites -- even our waiter agreed. The hash browns are in a hockey puck shape and if you like your's crispy then you're out of luck since the hash browns are predictably soggy in the middle. They also arrived barely warm. My husband avoids dishes with their hash browns. The gravy is also different, with big chunks of carrots and celery. I know people who like Snooze, but sorry -- I don't find their food cooked-to-order, nor inspiring."}
{"text":"Ooo. M. G. Pancake flight and Steak& eggs benedict. Everything was to die for!  I mean literally I thought I died and went to Breakfast Heaven! Whoa!  Perfect combination for Hubby and I to share!  Definitely needed the hiking and Bike ride to burn it off though! Totally worth it!!  We sat outside and they have LOTS of misters and a big patio complete with a ping pong table which was fun. The vibe is fun and modern with bright happy colors and open spacious feel.  Our new Tempe favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and device. We're visiting from Out of town, and this place was recommended to us. I wish it was here when I went to ASU. Allyson and Kate provided excellent service at the bar. It's sometimes rare to find this type of service in a college town. The pineapple upside down pancake was to die for. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We love trying new places and this place did not disappoint.  We were told quite a while ago that Snooze was overrated so we've never been in a rush to try it.  Actually we did attempt to try it once but the wait was too long.  (And Not being in a rush to try it anyway, we headed over to Biscuits... which was meh).   This particular visit was on Tuesday morning (11/22) and surprisingly the wait was still about 20-minutes long. The bar was open so we sat there and just took in the energy of the place: super positive, fun and cheerful.  Our bartender was very busy yet still was able to maintain an excellent level of customer service.  She was attentive, smiled and praised us on our choices.  We just felt welcomed.  (We're in the service industry where hospitality reigns supreme; so when we see it we make sure to acknowledge it).  And the food!  Wow.  We had the breakfast pot pie and the chunky monkey.  I probably could've had two servings of each as they were so tasty!  And of course I had to try the Mmm mmm mimosa (even tho I don't like champagne); it was delicious!  Overall our experience exceeded our expectations and I hope Snooze continues to focus on elevating their customer service as this is seriously lacking in neighboring restaurants!  Great job!"}
{"text":"Well worth the wait for an amazing Sunday morning breakfast! Friendly knowledgeable staff from start to finish. They text you when your table is ready so you can leave the premises if you'd like to do some nearby shopping. When I couldn't decide between two types of eggs Benedict the server said that they could make the eggs Benedict half and half. Fantastic food and service, not a place to go if you want to get seated right away."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try snooze! I read a lot of the reviews and they were very positive. That being said I was a little underwhelmed. The coffee was not great, I ended up sending it back. I got the pancake flight and the best part was the sweet potato pancake. That was delicious, the other two (blue berry and chocolate chip) were dry and not great at all. I'm kinda a pancake snob so maybe I'll give them another shot....but I won't be ordering the pancakes. Unless it's the sweet potato!"}
{"text":"This past Saturday I came in for my first experience. Right off the bat people were friendly and very energetic. It's exciting just to walk in the doors. The line moved quickly and we were seated much sooner than I expected.   Jessica was our server and she was great! I was a server/bartender for almost a decade so I have high expectations for quality service. She was fun and prompt.   The entire staff was very helpful as well. They all took turns entertaining my son of 2 years old and another employee Natalie was excellent with him as well.   The food was absolutely amazing! We ordered a pancake combo and had three different kinds. My personal favorite was the sweet potato pancake.   I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Brunch lover here! We recently moved here from Seattle and I loved all of the hype surrounding Snooze so we have given it a try on multiple occasions but am otherwise underwhelmed with their menu and overall experience.   My family has gone to the downtown Tempe location multiple times and have enjoyed it but find the hype a little overrated for what we were met with. Being there at brunch you know it's busy but the waiters have been so maxed and are literally at the table to take your order then you're on your own which is a bummer. Still on the hunt for the place we will become regulars at :)"}
{"text":"I had a breakfast burrito and my wife had eggs Benedict.  I was there with a big group and it took 30-40 minutes to get seated, this place is very popular.  Nothing about the place screamed college, but it was across the street from the ASU bookstore."}
{"text":"Jam packed on a Friday morning during the last week of Spring Training.  The restaurant is located in a mall, but malls are big down here in AZ.  Waited 45 minutes. Our server was really positive and smiled a lot.  We had 7 adults and 2 toddlers and it worked out perfect.  Everyone liked their food.  We friends love going to Snooze so we will go back!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat with cool atmosphere. Food was delicious and I loved listening to old school hiphop during breakfast. They also text you when your table is ready so you can check out boutiques and shops nearby, instead of cramming into a lobby. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"If I can eat a cage free egg and gluten free pancakes and listen to Pink Floyd, this place is cool with me!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of breakfast food (but the girlfriend is, so we brunch) but I always find something really good here. Plus they can do just about everything gluten free. The wait can suck, so go early or on a weekday. Chairs are a little weird."}
{"text":"Brand new and looks great! Great patio!  Start with the Pancake Flight and share with your table.  Try the pineapple upside down pancake for sure.  The breakfast sammie \"sandwich I am\" is on a fresh pretzel bun and they will prepare to your liking if you are not in the mood for it as is.  The variety of eggs benedict are extensive and they are tasty, the best part is you can mix and match them so that makes decision making a bit easier.  Try the Chili Verde and the Late Harvest.  No bike racks yet but there are some down the street. If that is something you are interested in, tell the management, the more demand the better."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time this month and loved it!! I came during a weekend morning and it was pretty crowded. They take down your name and number, so you can walk around College and they will text you when your table is ready.  The inside is pretty retro and cool. The waiters and waitresses are really nice and friendly.   I got the breakfast tacos and they tasted really good! They were filling too. I heard they have really good mimosas, but I didn't try them, so I can't tell you if they were really good or not. I would recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"I LOVE SNOOZE. I used to come here 3-4 times a week but in efforts to save money I have been trying to not go out as much. This is a great place to go for breakfast or lunch as you are more Han welcome and encouraged to customize any thing you order to your liking and specs. The staff is fun and upbeat and don't make me want to fall asleep at my table. They are knowledgable and they genuinely care about your experience. If you are lucky you may receive one of their chefs complimentary pancake treats :)   Oh yes. And great strong coffee."}
{"text":"We love Snooze! Lots of yummy gluten free options including delicious pancakes. Cage free eggs, thick cut bacon and delicious coffee and to top it off their service is always so friendly.   It's worth the 30minute wait"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast stop for the family. A bit of a wait but well worth it--put your name in and stroll around the plaza a bit. Good gluten free options on all pancakes (no extra charge). We hit this place in Denver and were happy to find it in AZ."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Great food.  Fun atmosphere and music. Worth the wait. The waitress lost our ticket order. Waiting waiting. Then manager came out to apologize and  to retake our order and comped our meal.  Made it even nicer when it's comped. Super tasty."}
{"text":"Snooze is by far one of our favorite breakfast spots! Super friendly staff, to die for food, and amazing drinks (booze and no booze). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I wanted to be more pleased. It's rather expensive for the amount of food you get. Maybe I have to try their drinks they seem to be the most appealing. I'll give it another shot someday but it was OK  also the service could have way better considering there were so many people working..."}
{"text":"A good place to eat breakfast, all in all, but I have some reservations.  I again ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie, as I did in Denver. It is good, but not great. There isn't anything filling about it and the gravy was skimpy at this location. After cleaning my plate I left unsatisfied. It's a clever dish, just not dialed-in in my opinion. For the price there needs to be a better meal put in front of me. If I come back I am trying something else because all the other people at my table had ample portions, so much to the point they could not finish their food.  The coffee, man, what the heck? For a coffee they tout they have gone to great lengths to assure the integrity of it is about as flavorful as a cup of Folgers. One of the biggest disappointments for me in a breakfast spot is the lack of attention to the coffee and how it compliments the food. This coffee is simply not there.  The service was spot on. Great staff that were energetic and accommodating. I am positively impressed with their care and attention to detail. And to tell a table at the height of service on a Sunday to \"take your time, no hurry, do you want more coffee?\" is as about as welcoming as a place can get. Great job, folks."}
{"text":"Looking for a great breakfast in Phoenix, Snooze is it. The pancakes are thick and delicious. The hash browns perfect and not greasy. Eggs fresh and cooked perfectly. Most of the staff are excellent. Snooze you will not even be bothered by the wait."}
{"text":"Our server was very attentive and explained everything very well and we only waited about 15 minutes.....they have done great flavors of pancakes....I enjoyed the pineapple upside down pancakes.....along with the corned beef hash.....a very nice stop...."}
{"text":"The wait is too long and don't take reservations only been here once so can't really judge it on food... I had their burrito w/ soyrizo and it was NOT good better off getting it at a Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love love love! Every time I go it is always great and the staff is awesome! The breakfast cocktails are delish! Amazing food, amazing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food, great environment. The only things I would consider a negative would be our service wasn't top of the line, but I can forgive them due to the amount of customers in the restaurant. The other negative would be wait time, but that again I can't fault Snooze, they are just THAT GOOD."}
{"text":"Restaurant not busy, but long wait for food.  Other tables came in after us and got food and left before we got our food.  Food comes out cold and bacon burnt."}
{"text":"Food was great and the vibe of the place was a blast. Pets everywhere and a fired up crowd."}
{"text":"We went to Snooze when it first opened and we're not impressed. But we gave it another chance and our opinion did not change. Have had other friends go and say they like it. So months later we tried it again. We waited at the host stand and the employees did not seem as if they were at all phased that potential guests were waiting to have the past experiences erased and replaced with a whole new perception. The lady who greeted us was pleasant enough and directed us to our seat.  She did not ask if the table was to our liking but said \"here you go and your server will be right with you \".we asked if we could sit somewhere in the back where the sun would not hit us in the face. She obliged but seemed very put off by the ridiculous request and our audacity to want to sit elsewhere.  The employees fit a certain mold but I would prefer employees who were more energetic and happy to have guests walk in the door who could be potential regulars. We went to the Farmhouse instead where the ambience is real and genuine and did not command an eye rolling disdain from the seater when I as a guest asked to sit elsewhere"}
{"text":"Tuesday the 28th, 10 AM, at least 30 minutes wait for inside seating,m or immediate outside. We sat outside at a table with an umbrella. Service was almost nonexistent, first water, than nothing, then a server who took our drink orders. Two coffees. Drinks arrived 10 minutes later, and we later had to ask for refills. Eventually our order was taken, food arrived about 15 minutes later. Wife ordered breakfast tacos that indicated on the menu they contained scrambled eggs. I ordered an bacon and Swiss omelet and subistuted a cinnamon roll pancake in lieu of toast. When the food arrived there were no visible scrambled eggs in any of the 3 tacos. My omelet was swimming in a pool of some liquid, butter? Cooking oil? The grease from the bacon? Not very appetizing. Also on the plate was a hockey puck sized serving of hash browns. The omelet was tasty, but not exceptional. The hashbrowns were grilled inside a.metal ring and aside from the crunchy browned top the rest were essentially warmed shredded potato, and a far cry from my expectation of hashbrowns. The large pancake came on a separate place and it was surrounded in a moat of what I suspect was the cinnamon roll glaze.  The pancake was topped with pecan bits, some glaze and a dollop of cinnamon sugar. To recreate the cinnamon roll one had to re-glaze the pancake mixing in the cinnamon sugar. The pancake was OK, a bit sweet but that was to be expected. Almost at the conclusion of our meal, A coffee refill arrived as did a fresh glass of water. My wife got neither apparently she had to ask as I did, silly of me to think they would have offered to refills to both of us. The food was hot, it was filling but the totality of the experience was such this 1st visit for us will be our last. Our breakfast consisting of three small eggless  tacos, an omelet, a hash brown puck, a flavored pancake plus two coffees came to twenty- nine dollars and change. The pancake BTW was ala carte and was listed on the menu for $5.00, although it was only 3.50 as a suistution for toast. We can now say been there done that. This review was submitted in reaction to my wife's having pointed out how horrible her meal was and this is the first time in years she has said anything negative about any dining experience."}
{"text":"Chilaquiles eggs Benedict and pineapple upside down pancake was so dang amazing. Zero complaints on the food only con was the insane wait time which is understandable, and the not so great waitress"}
{"text":"While the wait was expected, we enjoyed spending the time across the street at Bergies. Once seated, we had great service. The food was delicious and the different selections for alcoholic beverages was appreciated. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cheers to the pancake flight. Whoever came up with this idea was a genuis. The flight is three cakes of your choice at 8 bucks or so. The sweet potato was the best, followed by the pineapple upside down version and then the choc. chip variety. I also added a pretty tasty mocha at $3.50. The pancakes all had an unusual butter variety on each flavor which also upgraded these hotcakes to the next level.    We only waited about 12 minutes on a Saturday AM and they have free coffee to drink during your wait. We snagged a nice table outside before the heat kicked in and there is a reason this place is popular - it's good. This is another chain though, but in the end, as long as the food makes me happy, it doesn't matter chain or not."}
{"text":"Great food! The Bella Bella Benny and OMG French toast are amazing. Cappuccino was delicious as well. Awesome service by Charles! Fun atmosphere. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever.  I have dreams about Snooze breakfast.  It is that good.   I had first tried Snooze in Denver.  Then we moved to Phoenix and found out there was a location here as well.  Best day ever.   The Breakfast Pot Pie.  The Breakfast Tacos.  The French Toast.  Those would be my 3 favorites...in no particular order.    The atmosphere is great.  The food is awesome.  It's a staple! Do yourself and your belly a favor and just go there already."}
{"text":"Great food and service, but be prepared to wait awhile during peak times. It's a popular, trendy hangout. Juan's street tacos with poblano hollandaise sauce have great flavor without being spicy. Another good choice is the spuds deluxe, which is is mound of hash browns covered with cheese and a choice of two fillings. The pork belly bacon is really good as well. We sampled a salted caramel white chocolate chip pancake too and it was rich and sweet, but tasty as a dessert. We love breakfast places that have espresso machines and a bar - this one didn't disappoint. Can't wait for the Gilbert location to open!"}
{"text":"First time here had Kylie was our waitress and made this visit amazing. She was kind, courteous, very attentive & had pretty good knowledge of the menu which is a huge plus! Ask for Kylie!"}
{"text":"Visiting from WA. Was told our wait would be about 20 minutes. Took my number so they could text me when we they were ready, which was really nice. Wait wound up only being 10 minutes! :) Great service and the food was super tasty! Kiddos both got an assorted pancake platter, ones favorite was the pineapple upside down and the others was the chocolate molten. Tasty bacon and hash browns on the side, with perfectly cooked eggs. I had the corned beef hash and my daughter kept stealing it! Good coffee and great size! The kids want to go again tomorrow and I agree! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place! Cute updated diner atmosphere-great coffee. Full bar and lots of recommended breakfast beverage combos. Waiter Alex took great care of us. Tried two Benny's and pancakes- super yummy! Spuds delicious!!!! And everything was perfectly seasoned-sure wish we had one in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This eatery is delicious. I first ate at a Snooze in Denver, CO (a few years ago) and was delighted to find out that Phoenix had one. A group of us had lunch, and just as expected the food was amazing. The only complaint I have is that our waitress didn't visit our table often. It took a while to get our food, and we were never asked if we wanted to order drinks. All that being said, the food is outstanding, the atmosphere is inviting, and everything on the menu is tasty. I highly recommend the Eggs Benedict lll!"}
{"text":"From reviews and the extremely long wait I expected much more.  The staff was indeed great.    Our server was very attentive and kind.  The food however was just average.  The regular brewed coffee was honestly the worst I have tasted.  I had blueberry pancakes that were very heavy and had a slight burnt taste.  I also had a side of scrambled eggs that were among the best I've had.  So I guess it was a mixed bag.  Great people, lousy coffee, not great pancakes but great eggs.  If you don't like setting around dogs ask for a seat inside which will undoubtedly make your long wait longer."}
{"text":"Best breakfast we've had in Phoenix for its' price range! We tried 7 kinds of pancakes with a \"Pancake Flight\" for each of us, plus a special house pancake called \"Sinner's Delight\" that blends maple and bacon.   Also gave homage to the Chillaquera Benedict and breakfast tacos, including the house hash browns. Topped it all off with the Socialist Pig and Rocky Mountain Mule cocktails, along with a cup of their delicious coffee.   Literally everything we had was beyond delicious. The atmosphere is great, the service is friendly, and the food is fantastic. Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Long line. But, the waitresses/waiters are very nice. A very nice lovely place. The seatings are kind of cramped, but it's ok. The food is very typical breakfast food. Nothing out of the ordinary. But I loved the feel of the place. I love the variety on the menu. I had a great experience there."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! Nothing about it was good. I never write reviews but this was absolutely ridiculous.... we sat at the bar which I understand your not going to get the best service but to at least be acknowledged would be nice. We sat there for about 10 minutes while the bartender was organizing the fridge before we were even asked what we wanted to drink... then had to wait about another 10-15 before we could even order. Not to mention while we were sitting there the bartender was throwing lemons across the bar to get them in the trash very unprofessional.... if she was to miss it would have easily hit us or the people next to us. It's just disrespectful. Then the food finally came out and my girlfriends eggs weren't cooked all the way it was absolutely disgusting. I go to the snooze in Gilbert all the time and it's amazing. I had to go to work after we ate so we went to the Tempe location because it's closer to my job and it was a huge mistake... I paid 40 bucks to be ignored the whole time, have lemons thrown towards me, and for my gf to not even eat. I was a restaurant owner for years and I would never have the people that were behind the bar working for me. Ever. Idk if it's because they're next to asu and the people working just don't give a fuck or what but absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Food here is absolutely phenomenonal.  There is a nice outdoor seating area with a great view. AND be sure to try one of there mimosa."}
{"text":"4 Stars because I've only been here once.  Pancakes on point! Breakfast Sammys for the win!  I mean, just yes, yes, go here and indulge! All of the Pancakes were amazeballs and the Breakfast Sandwiches were made with such fresh tasty ingredients and they weren't greasy or sloppy like a lot of Breakfast Sandwiches. I also really enjoyed the Hash Browns, crispy and also not greasy so yay.   It's pretty cute in here, the service was great, food came out at a reasonable pace and it was clean. If you're trying to eat healthy, although this place tastes like it uses fresh ingredients, their offerings aren't too healthy; and really you have to come here for the unhealthy tasting goodness anyway.  Oh and P.S Houstonians who see this review, there are plans to open one here soon!"}
{"text":"Great location across from Arizona State University campus in Tempe. Young vibrant high energy crowd. I need breakfast this morning there were many business people there with students and a lot of laptops using the robust Wi-Fi. Very clean venue, good value pricing on the menu friendly and fast service b I ordered an egg white omelette with chicken sausage, wheat toast and hashbrowns. My omelette was perfectly prepared I also had jalape√±os spinach and tomatoes. I had a very exotic brand of wheat toasted not sure what it was but it was fresh and tasty. Hashbrowns came out it in an usual circular presentation but they were perfect. Restroom small but clean. Many different seating options which I love the venue is very bright. Outdoor patio seating is complete with a ping-pong table and games. Parking is a little tough metered parking outside if you're lucky. Parking lot right next-door at the sign is hidden"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday with my mom and toddler son. Went in for breakfast around 7:30 am after looking on Yelp for places to have breakfast in the Biltmore area. To our surprise, there was no wait. We were seated immediately in a comfy round booth. Ordered the breakfast burrito with the ranchero sauce no meat. It's been over 24 hours and i am still thinking about my burrito. My mom had the huevos rancheros, she loved her dish as well. My son had the kids blueberry pancake. And we ordered an extra buttermilk pancake plus two coffees- $50 after tip. Which for me is pretty expensive for breakfast. But the food was good. Service could have been better as I had to flag down other servers for more ranchero sauce, napkins, refills, etc. overall had a good experience, but is a bit on the overpriced side for breakfast."}
{"text":"Beer flight, wine flight but how about a PANCAKE flight??!?! They have some delicious pancakes, you'll have a hard time choosing on your first visit go with the flight you won't regret it. Blueberry Danish was the winner on my flight which I'll be dreaming about all day. Quick attentive service topped off a good visit."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!!!!!! A breakfast place in this center.....I enjoyed my experience from the friendly staff to the delicious food....upscale funk.... The employees seemed excited about Snooze, customers, the food and just everything... Wait staff knowledgable about the menu and made good suggestions... Because a good cup of coffee can't be beat...I ordered a house coffee... Because basic eggs and potatoes can't be beat..I ordered the 3 eggs and home fries with a side of pico de g....the eggs were a perfect over easy...potatoes delicious with   just the right seasoning....the pico was fresh and delicious....catsup would be insulting the chef... I will definitely return to try the other tempting dishes on menu.... BRAVO'!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the best food ever! Our server Lolita was super nice. If you plan on eating here be prepared to wait. The wait is totally worth it. They have a good system in place where they text you when your table is ready. We tried the pinapple upside cake and I about melted it was so delicious. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"We decided to give Snooze a try this past Saturday.  I went prepared for an hour plus wait and was pleasantly surprised to find out the wait was only 15 to 20 minutes. We put our name in and they texted us about 15 minutes later.  On time...great!  We immediately go to the hostess stand and were told our table was being bused and to wait off to the side.  Um...ok...  Ten more minutes go by so I went back up to the hostess stand to see what was going on.  She said that I was going to be seated any minute.  I look at my phone and they had texted me again despite me standing in the exact same place the entire time.  Weird.  Anyway, we are finally seated.    I order a diet coke and the waitress brings me a coke.  No big deal.  I tell her and she brings me a new drink and takes our order.  In the meantime, apparently Snooze VIPs are seated next to us as the manager spent several minutes talking to them and they were even given a free pancake.  Nice.  Good for them.  Not so nice is when they get their food before us even though we were seated ten minutes earlier.  A half hour goes by....still no food. Our waitress says it will be out \"any minute\".  More people that were seated after us are getting food and some of them are even done eating by the time ours finally comes out.  I ordered the French toast, which was good but not great.  It was two slices of wonder bread with a strawberry or two on top.  My fianc√© got a bowl of hash browns with some cheese on top.  I can't remember what they called it on the menu.  I guess the food was good enough that I would go back if the experience was better.  At this point it's not worth it for me.  We live less than a mile from Snooze and love to go out to breakfast.  Despite the convenient location, I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic eggs Benedict. I had the duo with a regular ham benny and a child Verde benny. SO good. And the staff was so friendly!!"}
{"text":"After waiting for 30 mins for a table and another 40 for food we left when we were told It would be awhile for our food because the kitchen was so backed up. Many employees talking to customers but apparently none who can cook. None of the tables around us had food. Don't go unless you have a few hours to wait for a couple eggs."}
{"text":"My family and I tried Snooze for the first time recently and it was AMAZING! Out of the nine of us there was not one complaint about the food. I personally LOVED their cinnamon roll pancake (we shared this as a group appetizer of sorts) and the nutella French toast was to die for!  My only complaint is the wait time (at least an hour) and that they don't take reservations. My family and I love to all go out to brunch together once a month, but it's a big group of usually about 10 of us. When restaurants don't take reservations it can be hard to accommodate such a big group and it's usually a long wait. The food was worth the wait, but without reservations we can't make it our regular brunch spot."}
{"text":"I find it a bit odd that people give 4/5 stars due to a wait time but loved everything else. Snooze, like a lot of other restaurants these days, texts you when your table is ready. If it's not clicking just yet just hold on... that feature allows you to go for a walk around beautiful downtown gilbert or head in the shade or make a phone call, whatever! You don't have to stand guard at the door waiting for your table because wherever you are, your phone will tell you! A 50 minute wait everyday means the place is really worth waiting for! Service is great and the food is amazing and super customizable. This place is awesome and should be rated based on their food and service."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's one of my favorite breakfast restaurants in Phoenix.  Every time I have gone it has taken a long time to get seated. When you finally are seated, however, it's well worth the wait. The staff are all so friendly and if you joke with them they will joke right back. It's a pretty casual chain with the waiters wearing t-shirts and everything is super chill. Wait time for the food itself isn't too bad. Not as bad as the wait time to be seated. The prices are a little high but what I've found is that most high quality breakfast chains are. Convenience: 5/10 (but worth it!)  The food is out of this world. Everything that I have tried seemed to be cooked to absolute perfection. My favorite thing to get here is the spinach and mushroom omelet. It's so good! Every time I take someone new they are so impressed with the quality of the food and are so happy I introduced them to this place. Taste: 10/10 for sure  Overall I'd rate Snooze 5/5. The place is nice, clean, and tastes good. Everything I want in a breakfast chain and more!"}
{"text":"WE love breakfast. This place has it all! Creative. Flavorful. The prices are a little above what I like to pay but, it is worth it. Any of the Benny's are delicious! Any of the pancakes are delicious!"}
{"text":"First of all the food is great i really liked it but the service from our server Megan was not so great she only came by our table once I tried to get her attention multiple times but she straight up ignore  us other then that the place was good."}
{"text":"Loved their pineapple upside down pancake with cinnamon butter: skillfully controlled balance of sweet / tart.  Not so much a fan of their cocktails but would visit again for those pancakes! (You can also get a 'flight' so that you can try three different preparations).  Seriously so good that as soon as I got back home got LA I was plotting a route to their Tustin location."}
{"text":"Anywhere I can eat a flight of something, is an automatic winner.  In this case, a Benny Duo in Spring Harvest and Chili Verdi.  Next time, the pancakes.  Thanks for having fabulous Faux options for my vegan buddy!"}
{"text":"Boom! Amazing breakfast burrito! Fresh squeezed OJ! Yum! So many things on the menu I wanted to try, too few days in my trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"The Snooze am Am Eatery was ok but not worth the trouble it takes just to eat there.  Food was good, staff was friendly and the silverware was exceptionally nice.  The bad was the fact that the wait is long and they don't do any type of reservation. When I first got there I waiting in line to sign up for a seat only to find that it wasn't a line, just a large group of customers that were waiting to be seated. There is no clear waiting arrangement or area, so everybody just stands around everywhere waiting for a text in a area that gets bad cell service to begin with. Alright I'll go with it, I signed up and was told the wait time is 20-30 min. 45 min later I was seated and the wait was particularly unpleasant. No where to set, except outside and it was hot.  Meal was good, upside down banana pancakes were good. And the silverware was actually really nice.  All in all not bad, but again not worth the trouble you go through just to eat. There are plenty of other breakfest diners that serve the same quality of food with less then half the wait time."}
{"text":"Hungover from a night of rocking out with Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers at the Yucca Tap Room, we woke up in the morning in search of breakfast. Travelocity pointed us this way.   Sunday morning/ish, we crawled across town, found parking, and approached the packed eatery. We shared a high top table with six other people in almost a cafeteria feel, appropriate for a college setting, and quickly realized we were the oldest people in the joint.  Who cares. Coffee. Please.   Waitress was adorable, sweet, helpful and fast. Got us that coffee and some water (good for your hangover) and I ordered the Breakfast Burrito (must have in AZ or NM when you're coming there from Boston) and my husband got the corned beef hash.   the burrito was outstanding. Got the green and red chile sauce in Christmas style, and had sausage added. Ten thumbs up. It was as big as my head and I ended up sharing about 1/3 of it with my husband.   The girl sitting catty-corner from me asked what it was and we struck up a conversation about the food and options. I didn't feel old anymore - I felt like just another breakfast woofer amongst a bunch of students, and then realized there were some parents there with their college kids and the place opened up to a bigger family feel in my mind.   I thought about a morning cocktail to keep the roll going, but we had to make tracks. The menu looked fantastic for such treats, and I kind of regret not getting one ...   maybe next time.   Wish there was a Snooze here in Boston. I'd so go."}
{"text":"Really good food. Loved the corned beef hash.  The waiters are kind of annoying though and always want to push you to get the check even if you're just chilling.  And one waitress saw me working on my laptop and asked me what I was working on which I thought was kind of invasive. Just mind your own business Snooze AM and bring me some more refills."}
{"text":"We split the breakfast pot pie and the sweet potato pancakes. Both tasted great. Everything on the menu sounds great. Downside is an hour wait Sunday about noon. And it was very warm in there. I was sweating while waiting. I heard that crowds are less before 8 and after 1."}
{"text":"Easiest Five Star I have ever granted. Too many amazing options on this menu for the one visit we allowed. Following our morning tun we arrived hungry. We split an Eggs Benedict order...which was encouraged as they allow you to order any two from the options. My husband ordered a chilequile version and I ordered a ciabatta, prosciuttobalsamic yummy benedict. Divine! Both. Sauce and eggs were perfect. Then we odered \"dessert\"...cause we do this. It was a donut pancake with cinnamon apples, chai glaze, candied walnuts and espresso syrup. The coffee was wonderful. Service exceptional. Outdoor dining perfect. Clean bathroom. GO EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast food and great atmosphere! I love that I can bring my dogs on the patio! The con is the wait time. Everyone loves this place, so get there expecting a 30min wait. It is worth it though. They have free coffee while you wait and they will text you when your table is ready, it is really simple. I LOVE the Benny Benny Benedict. I crave this meal."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest dining experiences I've had in a long time.  The hostesses, management and our waitress Carla, were sooo nice.  I came with my elderly mother and all were so kind and accommodating.  The eggs Benedict were the best I've EVER had (and my kids will tell you I order them from coast to coast).  The drinks were great, too.  Don't miss this place or you will miss out!"}
{"text":"We went there today. Had to wait about a half hour to be sat. (no biggie) Once we were sat, I noticed a couple next to us also with menus.  They ordered about 5 minutes before us.  They had eaten and left before we even got our food. There was also a party sat a half hour after us, and while we were STILL waiting for our order, the manager went to THEIR table and said their food would be out shortly. Meanwhile, we are STILL WAITING! No table touch at our table, which was disappointing. Felt like chopped liver. The food was ok once we got it. Not steaming hot or anything, but fine. I didn't care at all for the hashbrowns. I like mine flat and crispy. I was also disapointed that there is a 3.50 upcharge to change out the toast to a pancake. Totally not worth it.   The server was sweet, but we would have liked an update on why our food took waaaaaay toooo long.  I will probably go again as they had some really interesting things on the menu that I want to try. But in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"I love breakfast and this place was delicious. I love the pancake flight by far! They had a double chocolate on their flavor of the day and was by far my favorite. They get a minus star because I ordered sausage links on the side, and there was an eyelash or eye brow of some sort. Yes, I know it happens, but totally grosses me out. Asides from that incident, don't go late morning on the weekend. Gets super busy! They have decent outdoor seating, could use landscape upgrade, but all in all, good for big  or small groups and those with special diets."}
{"text":"I really want to give Snooze 5 of 5 stars for food but other factors diminish the positive ratings. Expect a long wait!!! Not a convenient waiting area and they sure could use some misters outside for people who are waiting, especially those of us with kids with the temps being out now. Or maybe they're there but aren't on. There are only two chairs inside for waiting which doesn't do much for the hipsters who don't have the respect to give them up for elderly, or moms with babies. Check in is ok and convenient. And the decor is bright and vibrant. Games out back in the rear patio area. Recommend the flight of pancakes and their hash browns are good. There is a full barista menu and morning cocktail options."}
{"text":"Food is usually fantastic. Today was not quite up to par. Server was a bit preoccupied. We ordered strawberries on the pancakes ask specifically for fresh not soaked in sugar. We didn't want them if soaked. Typically have always come fresh but last week they weren't so we asked. They came soaked in sugar again:( also two of us ordered hash browns flat and crispy only one of us got then that way:( server was refilling waters one in my part covered his glass and said none for me thanks. She the preceded to refill his glass. We will still come back but hope for different server."}
{"text":"Fantastic new restaurant! Great selection of breakfast items: I had the pancake flight where you pick three pancake flavors. I chose cinnamon roll, pineapple upside down cake and sweet potato! The servers are friendly and very quick, in spite of the fact that this place is always busy. This location is big; although there were many people here, there was no wait. I will definitely come back to Snooze. My whole family was in shock over how delicious their breakfast was. Incredible food, pleasant servers and no wait! Another plus: the sinks in the bathroom are cool and unique! Definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"Eh, ordered their pancakes and they were a snooze, maybe its just their pancakes or the morning we went. Ordered the pancake flight with pineapple upside down (menu says it has a house made creme anglaise, expecting the yummy custard sauce, instead received CREAM in the pancake, kind of odd), sweet potato(mine was good, hub ordered these by themselves and they seemed overdone and the caramel was overcooked), and strawberry shortcake(okay). Service was okay, they were busy. If we decide to try them again, it'll be different menu items."}
{"text":"James is the guy to get as your server when you land for breakfast here.  Play a game of ping pong while you wait.  The environmental efforts that they make here should be more visible to the public. Unless an employee tells the story of the company as James did you wouldn't understand the goals and forward thinking and planning that is going into this company.  I would Add contact information about the company to the table top menu to include the website the email and phone number and address. Giving the Yelp link for realtime comments.  We ate on the patio where we were protected by a double rack of 5 gallon propane bottles. Moving the propane out of the dining are would be a good. .  All the food was plenty to eat. The service iced fast and the wait was minimal."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to have breakfast (besides Cracker Barrel)!!!!!! It has nice decor, service is amazing and the food is just oh so delicious! The cinnamon roll pancake is a MUST try!!! I've never had a pancake that was as good as that one. It literally melts in your mouth! It's so huge that it fills up the entire plate, so you only need to order one. I also love Juan's breakfast tacos. It's everything that I would want in a breakfast taco and I also add bacon to it. I bring everyone here, including my friendds that come to visit Phoenix. Everyone needs to be hooked like me. I must warn you that it does get extremely crowded on the weekends. I usually do take out on Saturdays to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"If you're into sweet specialty pancakes, snooze is the move. Hands down, the best pancakes I've ever had.  I have had the pineapple upsidedown, the sweet potato, the blueberry danish, and most recently, the blackberry sublime pancakes.   The blackberry sublime is my new front runner- it has key lime pie filling, blackberries, graham crackers, and mascarpone whipped cream. Just as amazing as it sounds.   If you're into something more savory, I would recommend the breakfast pot pie and the sandwich I am (basically eggs Benedict on a pretzel roll)."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great French toast and great service. They don't take reservations so be expected to have a wait of 30-45 mins during peak hours. But it's worth it! Definitely a favorite."}
{"text":"I went here to try with my friend. We got seated at 9:35am and our food was served at 10:25am. I watched the clock during my whole visit.. My breakfast burrito didn't have some of the main ingredients. It was missing the black beans and the cheddar. I am disappointed with my visit. My food was cold and my order was incorrect. If fiends and family ask me about this place I will discourage them and I won't return here."}
{"text":"You can't hit the snooze button on a Saturday if you want to avoid a lengthy wait. As long as we arrive early in the morning, I'm all about this place. The service is great, the coffee flows freely, and the food is on point. Because carbs run the world, I usually go with the spuds deluxe. One day, I hope to venture out and try something new. Cute patio when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! Awesome atmosphere. Great for gluten dietary restrictions and very knowledgeable about cross-contamination. My Celiac daughter had the gluten free kids' French toast and loved it. They also have her a GF chocolate chip pancake to sample. Excellent find!"}
{"text":"I love this location of snooze. I get the burrito Christmas style every time no meat. Don't go on the weekends unless you want to wait for an hour. But if your hungry on a weekday, this place is the jam. The service is always great and everyone is always smiling, so it's a great place to set the mood for the rest of your day"}
{"text":"Came here to meet family for lunch during the work day. Food was PERFECT! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Elisa and fanny Are awesome. Very friendly great customer service cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"Sooo it was an hour wait and man was it worth it! Everyone so fun and upbeat! I think it was superhero day for the servers so they looked adorbs! We got some mmmmmimosa's! And the pineapple  upside down pancakes!!! Everything was quick nice, hot , and fresh!!! We'll be back next weekend for brunch!"}
{"text":"Now HERE is were the benny's are at. Perfectly poached eggs, a killer hollandaise sauce, and enough variety of flavors for you to mix and match.  You get two bennys and hash browns per order. The portions look small when the plates arrive, but they will definitely fill you up.  Granted, my friend and I also got a plate of pancakes to share along with his own entree. And our mimosas. And beermosas (With FRESH OJ, mind you. I loathe minute maid and concentrate junk). But it's ok because their prices aren't outrageous like some other bfast spots so you can go ahead and order whatever the heck you want. The spuds were great although a little carb heavy. The pancakes have a nice crispy exterior and a smooth fluffy interior. This probably will be my go-to breakfast joint!  Food is definitely worth the wait. Just anticipate that when timing your arrival and estimated eat time. Plus there's nordstrom rack, trader joes, and whole foods for you to peruse while waiting for the text saying your table is almost ready."}
{"text":"Looking for a great place to have a great breakfast?  This is it!  The service was fantastic and we were always taken care of.  The corned beef hash was amazing.  Highly recommended!  There are breakfast choices for everyone so you won't have to worry about not finding something you like.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Holy hell, the wait to just sign in was terrible. I was second in line to just sign in. Not a good start. Finally got seats (not picky ones) and our server didn't show up until we asked for some service for simple coffee. Please work a tad better on your service."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday for breakfast and while the restaurant was not very full, the service was very, very slow. We even had to run out to the curb to put more money in the meter because it took forever to get our meals. Additionally, it took almost 15 minutes for one of my friends to receive his juice because the waitress forgot it and never came back to check.  My chai latte was very watery and tasted bland. I won't be ordering that ever again.  Finally, I ordered a \"lighter\" option omelette, but it came soaked in greasy oil which was pooled at the bottom of the plate. All in all this was a pretty bad experience and I will be very reluctant to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and what a selection. Everything I've had on my first few visits has been excellent! Service is a tad slow but the guys I've had as servers have all been friendly and very helpful with recommendations."}
{"text":"Avoid the long lines everybody is talking about and go on a weekday.  Even on a weekday (Thur @ 9AM) to be exact, inside was already full but outside was empty - so no wait at all, and with the nice warm Tempe winter weather, I was perfectly happy to be outside with my sunglasses and a heat lamp on.   Others in my party ordered americanos or other fancy coffee from the barrista (which I am normally all about) but I just got their house coffee, which was great. But I am partial to just getting drip coffee when I do brunch.  I got their breakfast tacos (highly recommend) + bacon on top.  Others in my party got the corned beef hash, one of the benedicts with salmon, and the 3-egg farm style plate, everybody was happy with their meal."}
{"text":"Great food here, nice atmosphere too. Service was good despite the place being packed. Seems to be very busy most of the time. I had the corned beef hash and it was incredible."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. I love how it's in the heart of ASU campus and downtown Tempe. Every time I go up \"A\" Mountain, I\"ll end up going there to get breakfast. It's also my go-to for hangover breakfasts because they have a great menu, good prices and there's tons of parking in the vicinity.  Make sure you have some spare time because it does get busy and it can take a while to get a table sometimes. I'm gonna miss this place when I move!"}
{"text":"This place had an amazing atmosphere but there food was mediocre. The beans had a weird taste and I wouldn't order them again."}
{"text":"Picked up a breakfast order the other morning and the hostess who helped me was phenomenal. I've gone to many many restaurants and have 6 years of working in the industry, and she was one of the best hostesses I've seen. She was polite, kind, had a great attitude, treated customers great, was helpful, even gave me recommendations in such a fantastic way it made me want to come back specifically for what she said and described. She is younger, short hair and glasses. Will be coming back to dine IN, specifically due to her fantastic service. Excited this restaurant is in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The service from our server Jamie was friendly and perfect and the bennidect dishes are awesome!"}
{"text":"Tried Snooze in Gilbert as it is new to the area and my wife and I love breakfast.  Good stuff here.  We arrived around 7:45 on a Saturday and had to wait about 20 minutes.  That's a long time for being that early! Anyhow, although it was very nice/modern, the decor reminded me of The Breakfast Club in Scottsdale...not a bad thing.  The menu had a wide variety of breakfast food, all of which sounded great.  My son got the kids pancake, which was very good.  Wife ordered the breakfast burrito...when it arrived not only was it huge, but fill with top quality ingredients and great tasting.  I ordered the eggs & bacon (a breakfast staple).  Eggs were good, bacon was sweet, which was nice.  Hash browns were a little different as they arrived in a perfect circle.  They were good, but not the best I've ever had. Overall we had a positive experience and will return.  We will add this to our breakfast rotation."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast entrees! Completely satisfied! It was a 10-15 minute wait though on a busy Saturday morning..Gotta try if you're around the area."}
{"text":"I don't want to give them a great review because the wait for a seat will get longer. Pancakes are phenomenal!!! Staff is friendly and awesome. Chiliquiles breakfast was delicious!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to have breakfast every time I'm in Tempe or Phoenix area. This place dishes out the classic breakfast dishes with their own twist!   My usuals - Breakfast Pot Pie/Bella Bella Benedict/ Corned Beef Hash/O.M.G. French toast and always a side of tender bacon!   Snooze also has great drink selections with a well crafted breakfast oriented cocktail menu.   Also their pancakes are great, get the pancake flight and try the hot cocoa pancakes!   Go early, as lines start to build on weekends."}
{"text":"Got there at 7.00 am no lines. We got a lot of attention.  Had their pot pie . It was nice and flaky . Good flavor . Also had their special pancakes  . They are always  excellent.  . Great place if you don't have to wait"}
{"text":"Best brunch I have ever had!! The French toast is amazing and the eggs benedict is delicious! Excellent bloody marys and complimentary coffee while you wait for a table! My go-to brunch place for sure!"}
{"text":"Bangkok Bloody Mary. Do it. They are delicious.   After trying and failing to get into Snooze on a weekend, we finally made it on a Tuesday morning. There was still a little bit of a wait, but we managed to swing a couple seats at the bar where we stayed to eat. They generally seat the bar as part of the list, but it being a Tuesday and the wait not being very long, the bartender put in a good word and got us some menus. So here is my first bit of advice: if you want to go here on a weekend, make the time for it. Don't arrive starving. The place is regularly packed and on a wait and the food does not come out quickly. Take your time and enjoy.   I read a lot of great things about the pancakes at Snooze, but when it comes down to it, I am more a savory breakfast type of girl. I went with the eggs Benedict. I could not decide between the Chilaquiles Benedict and the Havana Benny, and so it was a very good thing that they do half orders! The Havana Benny ended up being my favorite; I found the chilaquiles a little bit under spiced for my taste. The hash browns were delicious, though I think the best thing about them was the presentation.   Overall, the experience was excellent and the bartender went above and beyond to make sure we got the right drinks and the right food."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have ever had, wow! They should be proud of what they have accomplished here. Please don't lose your focus as you grow."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite place to get breakfast. The atmosphere is amazing and staff are so friendly and nice to talk to. All pancakes can be made gluten free, my favorite is blueberry streusel. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Everyone we spoke to on our trip recommended to try Snooze. My friend has been to this restaurant once before, and so we decided upon this breakfast place. It does get busy, so I do recommend going early. We went around 7 AM and luckily got one of the last few tables before it started getting super busy.   Nicely decorated atmosphere with their own special decorations. Loved that they had cute modern round tables in the middle of the restaurant.   Food wise, I ordered the Reuben sandwich. Yes crazy to have this for breakfast, but it was available; and Reuben sandwiches are my favorite! Definitely a great tasting sandwich, and it does come with a side salad if you prefer. My friend ordered their pancake flight; and she choose the sweet potato, blueberry danish, and bourbon street pumpkin pancakes.   I do recommend if you're in the area and need a breakfast place; try out Snooze!"}
{"text":"Service is great and the food is good but lacks a bit of flavour. If you're up for the typical American breakfast with an updated twist, this is the place to come. The atmosphere is upbeat and everyone looks like they've just come off the set of Portlandia. If you like oddly shaped hash browns and quirky ketchup come by and know it'll be a bit pricy."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum.  Every weekend the line to get into Snooze is insane.  So, instead I went with some co-workers over the lunch hour.  The atmosphere is great and the overall vibe is very retro, really cool.  Service was great and we even got to sample a free Apricot Pecan pancake.  I had the cinnamon roll pancake and hash-browns and they were Deeeelicious.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Slow service and mediocre food. The physical aspect is nice, good use of color. However, the coffee cups are terrible. They do not fit the hand, they were a distraction from the coffee, which was weak.  I will not go back, too many other good places close by.  Note to mgr: manage for excellent service, not for pretending you are having a party at your house and everyone is your best friend."}
{"text":"This place is always busy on Saturday, but worth the wait!!!!!! Classic breakfast is delicious. They have vegetarian chorizo, it is to die for! Most places don't offer veggie meat but this is worth a try!!!"}
{"text":"Came in around noon, and did not need to wait for a table. Hostess was extremely pleasant as well as my server. We ordered the mmm mimosa, a recommendation by the server. And it was absolutely amazing. I myself got the Benedict (chiliquean??) and a half order of the French toast. Food was amazing. I love the French toast"}
{"text":"Great looking menu but horrible service. I ordered a standard meal that came with 3 eggs, toast, bacon and 1 pineapple upsidedown pancake. Eggs were not even close to cooked right. The signature pancake was just ok. But I am getting off track. The service or lack there of was worse than going to a Denny's drunk at 4am. We had to continually remind our waitress about everything. You want water? Better give her another reminder. You ask for jelly for your kids toast? Better reminder her AND she doesn't give you an option on flavors. She just walks away and brings a random jelly in a ramekin. Btw they do have options she was just to busy,doing nothing at all, to provide them to my daughter. Order coffee and cream? Had to remind her twice about the cream.   Ask about ingredients due to an allergy? Good luck they just told us not to order it because they don't know. Thanks guys! Allergies aren't always something that just give you the sniffles. My daughter is DEATHLY allergic to certain things and this day and age a lot of people are. You need to treat allergies seriously. It will also go a long way in terms of service.  My last complaint and I will stop. I ordered an iced coffee which came in a pint glass. The glass was mostly ice. So after getting my creamer and drinking my mini ice coffee down I order refill. Waitress gets it and this is where I had to remind her about creamer AGAIN!!! Any way I get our bill and they are charging me for two at $3.50 per. At this point I am stunned so I ask the manager why I am being charged for two since regular coffee has free refills. His response is because ice coffee comes from a keg. I could go on and on about his response, the way he came across and the fact that they are just taking brewed coffee, putting it in a keg, chilling it, pouring it back into a glass which is mostly ice, charging a premium and not offering a refill. I will just say that the manager was snarky and rude about it. Btw the waitress probably should have given a heads up too..  It is sad when your 5 & 9 year old pick up on how bad the service is....  No thanks snooze. You Snoozed and you lost my business. Not coming back and going to Coffee Rush for my iced coffee. Which btw taste better and didn't come from a keg."}
{"text":"The staff was helpful, attentive, and friendly. The delicious food and drinks made up for the noise level. We could barely talk to each other across the table. Not the place for a meeting unless you sit outside."}
{"text":"I usually love Snooze. My boyfriend and I fell in love with the San Diego location and the Tempe location so when we saw a Gilbert option we were pumped. Well, our first visit was just okay. The food wasn't that hot it was more of a lukewarm, as if someone had left it sitting for 10 mins. I got the tacos with chorizo was dry and burnt. I didn't say anything at the time because I figured growing pains. But every other time after the food is always lukewarm, the coffee is hit or miss, and there's always a wait for 2 star food and service. I will go back to Snooze but only in Tempe. Try Tempe it's better service and food."}
{"text":"They have some of the best pancakes  in town . Service is a little  slow. Try the cinnamon  pineapple  upside down and peanut butter. Desert  for breakfast"}
{"text":"Knew there would be a wait...but the the one thing I  really wanted to go for was the yummy pancakes.  I specifically asked our waitress if there was a pancake and eggs item.  She said no, had to order separate.  We placed our order and I ordered my 3.50 pancake.  We had great service for the first half of our experience. Our food came out and my pancake was raw inside! The batter was liquidy!! I showed the waitress the issue and she promptly took it back to \"show the cooks\".  30 minutes later...she returns ...my coffee still empty...acting surprised that someone else hadn't brought my pancake back out .  Then 15 min after that...she returns again saying they were just making sure it was fully cooked.  Still no coffee refill offered.  At that point, we had finished our meals! It was clear she had forgotten to follow up on my order to begin with and thought lying to me ...twice ... Would pacify me.  I told her to forget the pancake...and we also had to get up and ask another server for our own to go box.  Truly she was clueless about the entire situation ....very disappointed and i won't be returning."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I dont usually rate so low but hopefully all of the low reviews will prompt the owner or manager to take notice that there is much needed room for improvement. My  son and I had been looking forward to trying Snooze since we had seen it under construction. Arrived on a Friday morning and were surprised to see such a long wait for a weekday, we were in no hurry so we decided to wait it out. About 20 minutes into our wait and having to practically yell at eachother from the loud chatter noise (preferring to wait inside as it was blistering hot outside with no misters) I was starting to have second thoughts about waiting, but figured the wait would never be shorter on a weekend and we really wanted to try it... 45 minutes later we get seated. Service was descent at best. My sons corned beef hash was very tasty but we had ordered our eggs over medium and they were disgustingly runny, neither of us ate them. Never got a refill on water nor coffee.  I have never been to an eatery that left me with a headache from yelling across the table to have a simple conversation with my son... but this place managed to do that. Neither the long wait, food, service nor loud atmosphere was tempting enough for me to give it another try. It just wasn't that impressive to me. I'd much rather go to Black Bear Diner or The Groves where I can enjoy my breakfast without feeling like I'm at a Rock concert. Hope they make improvements before the thrill of trying a new place is gone. Can't imagine anyone rushing back to try it again."}
{"text":"YUM!  I am huge breakfast fan, and the food is delicious.  The first time I went for a birthday brunch on a Saturday morning, there was a very long wait-I won't deny that it was annoying, but us midtown/Arcadia folks love our bunches! ;) We were told a 90 minute wait (!) but it was more of a 30 minute wait. Even then, we did wait quite a bit for the food, plus some of our orders were messed... but, all was made up when we weren't charged for the mistakes PLUS a  $25 gift card!! All was made right! Pancakes were delish!!  Second time we went during the week for a brunch/lunch, with no wait. And friendly service.  Eggs benedict were ahhmazing!  Check it out, but be prepared for the wait on weekends!"}
{"text":"Today I had the quinoa porridge. It was really good but the portion wasn't filling for 8 dollars. I was trying to be healthy but ended up eating my friends hash browns and some of the sweet potato pankcake. Both were amazing but lots of sugar. Server was mediocre and food took a long time coming out. But nothing that will keep me away."}
{"text":"I was refereed to this place from a friend and decided to check this place out yesterday. It was a very nice looking spot but I had my order to go since I was at work. I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was bomb! Definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious. Worth the wait. Great place for breakfast or brunch with friends or family. Fun environment. I had the Nutella and banana pancakes bacon, eggs, and hash browns. Friendly staff. Very clean and great seating areas."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint!   Have been to Snooze a couple times with the girlfriend. I love how creative they are with the menu and how generous the portion sizes are. I usually get one of their spins on eggs benedict. Sooooo good! I have always been pleased with the service and staff. Wait times can be a pain. Although, I would say the wait is worth it.   Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with a friend. We waited for about 25 mins for our table. We ordered the eggs Benedict and was perfect. The waiter was nice and loved the ambiance."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST brunch place I have been to! The sweet potato pancakes with ginger butter, the French toast and their frittata was SOO yummy! Waiting for them to open in SF."}
{"text":"Fanstastic place to get brunch. Got the drunk'n monkey and pineapple upside down. AMAZING!! Jeff our server was super nice. Got a complimentary cinnamon pancake from him. So amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Gluten Free everything! Yummy can't go wrong here! Outdoor seating mid January.  Sweet potato pancakes and tacos! Brewmosa is outstanding."}
{"text":"Snooze is certainly helping with Town & Country's revival. It took me a while to come here due to the atrocious wait, so after the hype died down I finally tried it. The wait, which is pretty much the only negative, isn't too bad because they take your phone number and will text you when they're ready. It's nice that they have this option, because your not chained inside waiting for your name to be called. They have complimentary coffee while you wait, or you can always go over to Nordstrom Rack next door where I can easily kill 45min - an hour. So while the wait can be long, it's in the most painless way possible.  As for the food, I usually go the healthy route. The Snooze Continental which contains grapefruit br√ªl√©e is amazing, I'm slightly obsessed with grapefruit br√ªl√©e and will always order this if I see it on the menu. The pairing of vanilla yogurt with fruit and granola is equally as good. I've also had the Lower East Side which is good if you want to go the savory healthier route. As for the not so healthy, I decided to cheat one day and ordered the Blueberry Danish Pancake with Bacon & Barbacoa breakfast tacos. Oh man, I'm sorry I made this bad calorific decision because it will be so hard not to order either one of those again! The pancake was to die for! It was a fluffy pancake with a lemon ricotta filling, blueberry sauce and to top it off it was sprinkled with Danish crumbles!    If you have a leisurely day and aren't concerned with time constraints, then I highly recommend trying out Snooze."}
{"text":"Well, as others, there was somewhat of a wait, but in my case, totally worth it.  Our dish choices were absolutely delicious.  Our server was very  pleasant and attentive.  First time here and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"A coworker described this spot as a 'hipster IHOP' and from the moment we walked in, it did not disappoint. The booths feel like they're from an old skating rink in the 50s- the entire vibe of the place makes you feel like you may have somehow entered a diner straight out of Pleasantville.   We sat down and decided to start with some beverages - the bloody, the bacon cocktail and some iced mochas. Everything was awesome, but the bloody was next level. There were so many things on the menu that looked awesome, but we decided to pick from the extensive list of Benedict options. We really enjoyed that this place allows you to mix and match - getting one of a certain kind and another different.   I had the quinoa patty one, which was awesome without feeling too healthy and the barbacoa one which seamlessly combined eggs bene and a huevos ranchero vibe. My colleague got one with prosciutto which he said was just ok, and the standard ham one which was good.   The service was good as well. If I lived here this would be my standard brunch spot."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. My Benny was delicious with perfect poached eggs and stacked hash browns. My table mates got pancakes and chicken sausage. They were yummy too but too sweet for me. Perfect location near campus."}
{"text":"I HATE to give poor reviews, but I must warn others that if you have a group of people, you'd better call ahead!  We decided to have a family brunch here and were really looking forward to trying it.  We expected it to be busy and had a great time with the kids playing ping pong and enjoying free coffee, but waiting more than an HOUR?    The staff did not come to us with the delay, so we had to go check on the hold-up and make sure we hadn't been dropped off the list.  Everyone around us was seated and eating by the time we were seated.  It then took another 20 minutes for the server to take our order.    Hubby and I realized that food wasn't likely to arrive any time soon, and decided we had to leave and grab McDonald's (yuk) in order to make our tee time!  We had a great time hanging with the family, but were so hungry by the time we arrived at the golf course that I almost lost a finger as I wolfed down a quick sandwich from the clubhouse!  We figured 2.5 hours is plenty of time to have brunch with the family before golf.  We sure got it wrong that day!    As we were walking out, I snagged the person who had brought our menus and gave her a heads-up that they may want to expedite the food order at our table as our nephew had to be at work by 2:00.  Checked with the family later to see how everything turned out and they got food quickly and everyone enjoyed it.   I would try Snooze again because the food looks delicious, but it won't be with more than one or two people next time!"}
{"text":"I only give 3 stars because of their drinks.   My friend and I went Sunday for brunch and sat at the counter Bc the wait was over 45 min.   We LOVED our food....tacos, pot pie, and blueberry pancakes.   There wasn't a crumb left.   However the disappointing part were the drinks.  I ordered a bloody marry. And he order mm mm mimosa.   And we basically got oj and Tomato juice w a kick.  There was zero alcohol in either.   Somewhere with such great food should do better w their drinks.  Service was ok.  Not great. Not bad.  He was attentive after he finally greeted us.  Very sweet and a nice guy.  But when we told him the drinks were no good.  He made a joke and that was it.      I will def go back Bc food is amazing.  But I won't waste money on cocktails probably"}
{"text":"Took a trip to AZ for a baseball game (Go Dodgers) and one of the locals recommended this place... and OMG, this place is delicious! I want to go back to AZ just for their hash browns! Eggs were yummy too and the whole meal was inexpensive. My friends enjoyed their food too, including their mimosas. Ambiance is pretty chill. Nice, clean and great service."}
{"text":"I went to Snooze with a friend I hadn't seen in some time for brunch.  Wrong choice!!!!  We had to yell at one another to be heard.  The waitress had to yell to tell us about the special.  I guess the food was good.  We had such a case of indigestion from the loud music and lack of acoustics, it is impossible to judge the food.  I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"The food here is sooooo good. Best breakfast in town! The service is great too. A must try!"}
{"text":"I was looking for an interesting new place to go over the labor day weekend. I checked out the  Snooze website and reviews, decided to give it a try. Was very crowded, but didn't have to wait very long. Like some of the other reviewers, we immediately noticed how loud the music was. We were seated next to each other at the counter, still had difficulty carrying on a conversation. Ordered the Gazpacho Bloody Mary and a Melon Mimosa. Both were average. My friend ordered the French toast, side of hash browns, side of bacon. I had the blueberry pancake, side of hash browns, side of bacon.  The food is okay, neither of us were overly impressed. The bacon has a great flavor, but extremely greasy. I can't say that anything stood out as spectacular. I definitely expected an experience that stood out. Just a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious and easy to navigate a dairy allergy (waa waa). I ordered the Chile Verde Benny without the hollandaise and cheese but it was still so tasty! I split my entree with a fellow dairy avoider, who ordered the Quinoa breakfast bowl sand goat cheese. It was a perfect consistency of roasted vegis, quinoa and eggs. Friends I was with ordered the Huevos Rancheros (I tried some of the beans) and it too, was so flavorful. Although we were inside and it was quite loud, the food was worth it that day. I only got one picture - of my friends food - I was too excited to take one of my own."}
{"text":"This is my first post because I usually don't care enough to write one. This place is a waste of time and money. Horrible rude service and the food is bland."}
{"text":"First time here, we waited for 40mins on a Saturday morning which was the exact approx time given...  I actually timed it and it was accurate!! Our party ordered the steak and eggs Benedict, corned beef hash eggs and the OMG French toast. We were all impressed with how good the food tasted!! The French toast was excellent!!! I did give half of my steak and eggs Benedict to my son, and turns out the steak was undercooked. So they took back half of the order and came back with a full order taken off our bill! Excellent customer service with good food!!! Will definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"It bums me out to write this review since Snooze has historically been one of my favorite restaurants, however this most recent visit was inexcusably bad. I want to preface with the fact that the food is always delicious, and all of my problems have been with incompetent service.   Upon arriving we were told the wait time would be 30 minutes, and upon waiting we were called in 5. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing, however I was ready to leave instead of waiting half an hour for a table. My girlfriend talked us into staying. As far as the estimates is concerned the hosts need to give more accurate information or they run the risk of losing potential customers.  When we were seated our server greeted us about 3 minutes in and took our full orders. We asked for 2 waters to start and a couple simple drinks I've ordered at least 4 or 5 times before without issue. This is where the problems arise.  A family of 4 came in about 5 minutes after we did, at which point their drink orders were taken. We proceeded to wait 10 minutes with no drinks while the family received theirs in about a minute or 2. When our two drinks came out, we still had not been served any waters, and the drinks were 100% in accurate. I was served a half cup of foam with nothing else in the cup, when I'd ordered a tea latte with honey. My girlfriend's drink came out without the whipped cream she'd ordered.  We flagged down another server and asked if they could get our server, who had been MIA since taking our order nearly 20 minutes prior. She came to the table and I explained the situation to her. She proceeded to give me an excuse for every issue, to which we were of course sympathetic. She corrected the issues to the best of her ability, and for that I commend her. However, the incident had already left a poor taste in my mouth.  The food was delicious as always, and we of course had not been offered any condiments, so I stood up and found some for us to use, considering I didn't expect to see any of the wait staff any time soon.  The real issue came from the bill. My girlfriend got an entree that consisted of 2 free add-ins and the ability to pay for additional ones. She chose what most people would add, a meat and a sauce, and then asked to have an extra side of spinach and tomatoes, each of which were listed for 75 cents. The meat and sauce were listed as aproximately 3 dollars each. So when we got our bill, we saw that the tomatoes and spinach had been the items added in for free to the meal, and they had charged us for the meat and sauce that she originally ordered to come with the dish.  I don't know if this is common practice for Snooze, but I don't think I'll be returning. For as good as the food is, having to go through the headache of just getting what you wanted to order in the first place is not worth it to me."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine mentioned that I might really like this place. And I did really like it. The design is fashion forward. The menu is creative. And the service was pretty friendly. We waited for about 50 minutes, which seems to be on par. So we started with bloody Mary's, and one blackberry bubbler. For breakfast we had four entr√©es at our table. (See pics.) The waiter seemed not to know that the kitchen would do tofu scramble subbed for eggs. I would come back again but I would not wait longer than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast. My family and I can't get enough of it. The hashbrowns are amazing and my kids can't get enough of them. I can honestly say I haven't had anything bad here and I've had at least 4 or 5 different dishes.   If you're looking for a hipster, cool, delicious place for breakfast, this is it."}
{"text":"My friend suggested Snooze for a midweek breakfast. Little did we realize we would still need to wait to be seated. It wasn't long but I hate waiting. I like the easy going atmosphere. The entire staff was very friendly. The food was great. I had the standard coffee, eggs, bacon and potatoes with a pancake. Loved their take on the potatoes. And loved the sweet potato pancake. However, it shouldn't cost $17.25 for breakfast for one. I get that it's mainly local and organic but still..,it's a bit pricey. Overall great experience if you don't mind paying a little extra."}
{"text":"Having eaten at a Snooze in Denver, I was thrilled to hear there was one in Phoenix! We went on a Monday, and only had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. I felt the service was a little slow, but our server was kind, so it wasn't too big of a deal.  I ordered the breakfast pot pie, having eyed it before. I ended up not liking it at all. There was too much gravy, and the pastry was kind of gross. I couldn't eat even a 1/3 of it. My husband ordered the corned beef hash, and it was delicious, but the portion was TINY. He was still quite hungry after finishing. We both tried our toddler's blueberry pancakes and they were so good. It made me wish we had just stuck with the pancake flight instead of delving into the savory dishes."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots! Great food, great service and cool environment  for you and your four legged friends. I haven't had a bad meal there yet, all very fresh and I would highly recommend their breakfast tacos.  It does get pretty busy so get there earlier to avoid a wait ( they do not take reservations)"}
{"text":"During my Freshman year of college in Fort Collins, CO I used to go here every Sunday. They had the best vanilla lattes and eggs benedict. When I transferred to ASU my sophomore year, you can imagine how much I missed my favorite breakfast place. So when I heard that they were opening one out here in AZ, I was ecstatic. The menu was almost the same but more expansive and a little more \"southwest\" than the rocky mountain counterpart that I was used to.    I had my all-time favorite, the Bella! Bella! Benny without meat. It was divine. They top it with  a perfect balsamic reduction and creamy cheesy hollandaise sauce. It's on a bed of arugula and small crostini. It's a dream. They recently started allowing 1/2 and 1/2 where you can choose two benedicts for your plate instead of two of the same. I think this is such a cool concept, but I always stick with my go-to.   My boyfriend gets The B.E.A.T Sandwich. The man gives that Guy Fieri look to me every time. You know, the one when something is really, really....REALLY good. Guy, if you're reading this, you HAVE to come visit this place.   Expect a wait for a table on a Saturday or Sunday morning, but it's definitely worth it! They text you on your phone so you are free to roam around the shopping center while you wait. If you're anything like me and you end up here after a night out on the town, there's a Nordstrom Rack right next door to get a change of outfit."}
{"text":"Always a favorite in my breakfast list. I love the food, service was great, atmosphere perfect but something just seemed missing this time. I don't know my husband got the Rueben it was ok. The breakfast tacos were good. The breakfast sandwich was just ok. I love this place and will give it another chance."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!  Pineapple mimosas started off the morning right. Hubby got the corned beef and hash, and I got the Benny Duo (Bella and Chilaquila). Both were SOOOO good. Hubs asked if I wanted a bite of his, and I said no... only because I didn't want to share mine!  Everything on the menu looked so so good. Definitely will go back there next time we're in AZ."}
{"text":"As we walked up to the restaurant we smelled the wonderful aroma of breakfast that woke me up! The staff who was friendly, courteous and professional sat us down immediately. The servers were very prompt and friendly. Our server recommended the the OG French toast which was the best French toast I have had in years.  The entire family enjoyed their breakfast and really loved the decor and vibe of the restaurant ! We can't wait until they open one in SoCal.  I recommend this restaurant to everyone!!!! I can't wait to come back to AZ to enjoy an amazing breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go to for breakfast! The food is so delicious and the people here are so friendly! I've been in multiple times and i've never had a bad experience. Their customer service is phenomenal and so is the food. It's always busy, but that never has been an issue with the employees being so great! I definitely recommend (will continue to!!) this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Amazing buttermilk pineapple upside down pancakes with cinnamon butter.  Unique and delicious. Fun, bright orange and airy ambience at the new edge of the Tempe ASU campus.  Serves a variety of interesting bloody Mary's if so inclined including fresh gazpacho. Ordered the Benny Goodman eggs Benedict with salmon locks.  Scrumptious!  Fresh squeezed OJ too.  Big crowds, but move fast and will text you when table is ready.  Can hang out for free coffee while waiting or enjoy a nice stroll if the nearby ASU campus."}
{"text":"I've never been here when there wasn't a crazy long wait. I always say first available seating and it still takes 30 minutes to an hour to get seated on the patio. The patio chairs aren't comfortable and I find the tables too small considering the size of their plates. All that said, the food has always been very good."}
{"text":"Great variety of breakfast food options!  Their mimosas are especially delicious with fresh takes on them using a variety of juices.  I am a fan of eggs Benedict so their vast variety makes my favorite dish fresh every time I come in to eat.  Would highly recommend for a delicious breakfast with great ingredients."}
{"text":"Their breakfast offers are awesome. Pricing is modest. Blueberry pancakes terrific and wait system using texted messages efficient. The problem is with the service.  Food comes to the table for some folks not all. Hard to get coffee refilled. This has been my experience every time so far....hard to get return trips to the table."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Phoenix? Possibly.   This place is incredible. Went here this morning with a friend after we randomly saw it online and decided to give it a shot.   First of all, the decor is really cute and trendy. For lack of a better way to phrase it, it feels very college. Not surprising since it's located so close to ASU. We immediately loved the feel of the place. The menu has sooooo many good things on it so it was a struggle to decide what to order. Both of us ended up ordering the Spuds Deluxe. I got mine with bacon, ham, and red peppers. It was so delicious! The hash browns were fantastic and the meat was all well cooked but not overdone. I'd come here again in a heartbeat and I can't wait to do so so I can try more items on the menu. The pancakes and French toast sound extremely tasty!"}
{"text":"I was very excited about this opening as i've been to their Denver location a few times. It did not dissapoint! We went on opening day and the food and service we great! I'm fairly picky so I stuck with the plain'ol and it was perfect! My friends swear by their more adventurous pancakes so if you're into experimenting i've heard they're delicious."}
{"text":"OMG!!! My mom, daughter and I had breakfast here while visiting the area from Texas. Service was fantastic and the food was to die for! If I had unlimited financial resources I would be flying into town every weekend just to have breakfast here. I see on the website that locations are being added in the Dallas area. YEA!!! TIP: Forget the Walnut Hill location and open a location in  the Deep Ellum area (downtown Dallas). That would serve those of us who live in the counties SOUTH of Dallas. We do NOT like to drive to the north side!!"}
{"text":"It was absolutely amazing. I ordered the pancake of the day: chocolate chip pancake with vanilla bean sauce and was totally blown away. I will definitely visit here again during my stay here in Tempe. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and everything has always been awesome!! Amy took care of us today. She was awesome! Can't think of a better way to spend a Friday morning with my wife! Thanks Snooze!"}
{"text":"The absolute BEST breakfast experience I've ever had.  Loved the pancakes, loved the Benedict, loved the hash browns, loved the service."}
{"text":"HOLY PANCAKE.   I came here for the first time on Saturday with my boyfran before taking in the sights of house-hunting around Arcadia. Like Allie S. says, if we are going to be Arcadia folks, we better start brunching!   Everything here was amazing, but I am going to start with the best thing:   Chocolate Chip Pancake. I'm kicking myself for not taking a photo, but I guess I just couldn't wait. The pancake was crispy on top.. like how do I even explain it?.. this is a stretch but it was almost like cr√®me br√ªl√©e. Seriously incredible, best pancake I have ever eaten, and that's saying something.   We also had the ham eggs benedict. the most classic style, I think it was called Ham Benedict III. It was also the best benedict I've ever eaten, but not as unique in yumminess as the pancake. It's not fair to compare a benedict to a pancake, I realize, but still that pancake... anyways,  Finally, we got the Breakfast Pot Pie. I thought it was kinda weird, but I only had a bite. Here's my bfs description: \"Flaky, like a pot pie. But not really. I think I was just way more into the homemade chicken sausage\" - which brings me to my next topic,  Homemade Chicken Sausage. Again, not up my alley AT ALL, but he was in heaven. That and the fresh squeezed OJ. He was like \"I don't even ask if it's fresh squeezed. I just order it and if it's not fresh squeezed I know the food is going to be a joke.\" I guess he was right though, because the juice was delish, and the food was oMAHHHGAHHH good."}
{"text":"Great food! I recommend going on a week day because this place gets busy!!!!!! Despite the amount of people the service was good, coffee was amazing, and there was a great selection of food. Peanut butter cup pancakes to die for!"}
{"text":"No waffles.  Still, solid fare. Hot coffee. Flakey pastry. Price was $$, so no five-star. Good for brunch with the fam :)  I had the OMG French Toast. It was a better, lighter french toast than at diners. Lots of good fresh fruit.  The service was above average; forgot drink specifics, a little slow. And it wasn't terribly busy? A slow Sun AM."}
{"text":"Visited on the second day they were opened. On the recommendation of our server, Vinny, I ordered two different eggs Benedict. The first was their traditional Benedict with ham, the other was the Chile Verde Benedict!  The hollandaise was a cream cheese base so it was not as eggy as other hollandaise I've had and was tasty though more mild than expected. The chile verde pleasantly surprised me! Had a nice kick to the back end of the bite.  The tortillas in place of the English muffin gave a great textural contrast to the melt in your mouth pork!  I cannot wait to come back to try their many other food items such as their pancake of the day or their breakfast burritos that look like the size of a small child.  Overall a very great experience made better with the expertise and care of Vinny!"}
{"text":"I think last time I gave them a higher rating.  So, the coffee is good. But when reading the cute 'story' of how the coffee was sourced I was distracted by the numerous grammatical and spelling errors. Yes, it does matter.   Service? I preferred my server from my last visit, these servers today seem a bit trite (as I say, seem to me) or a tiny bit condescending.   For breakfast I had the blueberry quinoa porridge, which was good. But...kinda expensive for value. Heads up, if you like this stuff (and I do), you can get it frozen at Trader Joe's, around the corner of the shopping center, and it's good.  Nonetheless, this is a great place to go to eat breakfast and(!!!) the music wasn't nearly so loud this time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite brunch chains! I tried it out in Denver and LOVED it and was so pleasantly surprised they had a location in PHX (now just make your way east towards CHI, snooze! ;)).   EVERY SINGLE FOOD ITEM AND DRINK ITEM WE ORDERED WAS DELISH. My only complaint was the people next to me got something on the house for literally no reason. lol."}
{"text":"First time here, and the place is fantastic.  Very nice, open, bright interior.  The staff is great. And the Peter Paul Rubens sandwich is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and my first time experience was great. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. But for the second time I'm here, I'm not happy at all. I ordered a cold brew coffee and asked for cream and sugar when I ordered it. And I asked for it again when my waiter took my food order. After a long wait, I asked for cream and sugar for the THIRD time. Then my food came up and my cream and sugar was still not here. Then the waiter finally brought them to me. No apology at all. After we finished our food and he brought us check so fast and I even did not ask for it yet. Anyway, I will not eat here ever again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast/lunch before a Monday afternoon tour of ASU (new \"Future Sun Devil Welcome Center\" is right across the street). Our group did both sweet (pancake flights-- both highly recommended the Drunken Punk'n option) and savory (Havana Daydreaming and B.E.A.T. Sammies). The food was fantastic. Delicious OJ and coffee. Only complaint was that food delivery was slow.  I started to wonder if someone forgot to fire our order given the number of guests that arrived at the same time or after us that not only received their orders but also finished them before we were served. Our server handled it well though and had plenty of time to get to our tour. Will definitely visit again when looking for food in Tempe."}
{"text":"Qu√© cosa tan m√°s deliciosa de desayuno!! El lugar padr√≠simo, y el servicio de lo mejor"}
{"text":"First VISIT to Snoose, it comes HIGHLY recommended. Corned Beef Hash, hash browns, poached eggs, equals...  HAPPINESS !!"}
{"text":"Loved what we ordered: Benny Goodman egg Benedict, Bella Bella egg Benedict, and 3 pancake flight. Can't wait to go back and try more!!"}
{"text":"I think a 3/5 is a fair rating for this place, overall. There's a lot of hype over this place and they do offer a lot of different and unique food options.  There are things that I like about this place, like the water and coffee stand for customers who are waiting for a table, or the ping pong table outside for folks to play on. They also give you options to do a pancake flight where you can order 3 smaller pancakes or the option for 2 different types of Benedict. They are accommodating with requests or changes, and they have awesome coffee cups with the little thumb holder.  Unfortunately, there are some things I'm not a fan of here. First, the hashbrowns aren't really well seasoned and they are lukewarm or cold...same kind of thing goes on with the food...at least from my experiences. The pancakes are pretty good, as I had a couple nibbles from my sister's plate.  The last time I was there I ordered the breakfast burrito with chorizo. I asked for half green chile and the other half with ranchero sauce, to taste both sauces. The filling consisted of hashbrowns, scrambled eggs, black beans and chorizo; it was all cold. The green chile sauce was spicy, which I liked. The portion was large, but I still wished it was warmer.  Our server was pretty good about making sure we had coffee refills, initially, however since it was busy, it kind of went pass after some time, same could be said about water refills.  Maybe things would have been different during non-busy times. I had a really good experience at the other snooze location in Tempe, so maybe consider going there first."}
{"text":"Nothing like starting the day with a delicious Bloody Mary.  We opted for the mild, tho you can can order it with jalape√±o vodka if you want a little bit of a kick.  I ordered the breakfast pot pie.  Flaky, light crust with an interesting combination of sausage and gravy and veggies that have you licking your plate, topped with a Sunnyside up egg.  Nice!  My friends ordered the breakfast tacos and the pancake flight.  More things to try the next time.  And the next time.  And the next time."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and food and can't say enough about Flip.  He made our morning something special.  It was like talking to a long lost friend in a different city."}
{"text":"Creative and satisfying breakfast. Menu covers the spectrum. Really comfortable atmosphere. Get here early on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"So far, two brunches here. And I look forward to adding to that number!  Visit one - with a pescatarian girlfriend.   We each had a coffee (tasty blend - good roast - FRESH!) and started by splitting the pancake of the day. I really don't remember what was in/on it...but it was divine. My friend claimed it was the best pancake of her life - and she's a pancake fiend! There were a couple of the benedicts that were jumping out at both of us - so we decided to split two of them. Turns out - Snooze is happy to split up the benedicts for anyone at anytime - so we didn't even have to agree on the two to share. Since there is so much goodness in each - I am just copying the details from the menu on the ones we had:  \"Late Harvest Benny - Wilted Swiss chard, fennel and leeks served atop goat cheese and herb polenta cakes with poached Niman Ranch eggs, cream cheese hollandaise and toasted pine nut crumb.\" and \"Upstream Benny - Honey Smoked Salmon tossed with cucumber and corn salsa and served over jalapeno-cream cheese spoonbread, topped with poached Niman Ranch eggs and cream cheese hollandaise\" They were both absolutely phenomenal!  Visit two - with a male friend notorious for his appetite and food snobbery.  Since it worked so well the first time - I suggested we split the pancake of the day. Again - no memory of the crack they addled it with - but I could not stop - and I want to go back and get the daily pancake every day! I opted for the breakfast pot pie, and he had the sweet potato pancakes. Both were great - the puff pastry on the breakfast pot pie was absolutely perfectly executed. The pancakes weren't overly sweet - and the bits of ginger really made the dish shine!  There was a 20-30 minute wait each time - and both visits were intentionally planned to be around the \"slower\" times. I truly dislike waiting for a table - but Snooze, you make it so worth it!  See you soon!"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant addition to Phoenix! The menu here had a perfect mix of sweet and savory. Our server mentioned that snooze is known for their pancakes and benedicts. I'm a huge (HUGE) pancake person but decide to branch out and tried the Late Harvest Benny. It was delicious, with just the right amount of hollandaise so that I didn't feel too guilty after finishing!   Definitely will be back, if only to try something sweet next!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast, great coffee. Portion size was a little small. But quality was there and cooked to perfection. Had the corned beef and hash, and would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"Snooze AM is certainly one of the best breakfast spots in Arizona.  The service is great and friendly.  No matter if you get eggs, the famous pancakes, or french toast, it will be delicious.  I take all my friends and clients to this place and everyone always loves it."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Good service. The only thing I didnt like was the music was up so loud that you had to almost yell across the table just to talk to whoever you were with. Its in a great location in Oldtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. Food, service, etc. wait was long, but so worth it.   Recommend French toast or scramble. I'll be back next time in Phoenix"}
{"text":"The food at this establishment is definitely worth the wait for a table. The eggs benedict combinations are unique, and each one I've tried so far has been exquisite. The mimosas are also delightful, with different juices to choose from and the perfect champagne to compliment them. The atmosphere is light and fun, and it is the perfect place to meet friends or bring a family. The staff too, from the hostess to the bussers, are energetic and easy going. This is definitely my go-to place for brunch."}
{"text":"Fun and different menu. Came with a big party and sampled a lot items and they all were amazing. The pancakes are delicious! The iced chai was ok just not sweet enough for me. Fun atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Snooze has such a cute bright and friendly atmosphere. It's a great place to meet up with friends in the morning, whether it be to catch up after a long night of partying, or for a post hike meal. Just know that if you plan on stopping by during the weekend after a morning work out, make sure you get there early enough to avoid the crowd so that you can get your protein in asap. If you come later in the morning, you will be sure to find yourself a line.  What's cool is that they take your cell number and text you when your table is ready, so you don't have to worry about staying too close. They have a coffee bar in the front for those waiting, as well as corn hole in the patio to keep people entertained.  They have a nice selection of foods on their menu. So far my favorite has been their OMG French Toast."}
{"text":"Visited Snooze on New Year's Day. Very busy with all the staff working hard. One staff member was missing though - the cleaning person. The floor had puddles of spilled drinks and who knows what else and the restroom was filthy. Lots of staff, but still one short. Gave it a 4 because the food was great."}
{"text":"I love this place and if you want alcohol this is the perfect place to go to because they give out morning cocktails"}
{"text":"This place is busy! They said it was kinda slow but it was packed for a Monday. I can just imagine the weekends!   So my first time here. When I came in they asked me how many people but it was just me & my lonely self. So they said I can get a table or booth but it would take about 15 mins. They also offered me a seat at the bar which I took cause there was seats available & you can choose where you want to sit.   I sat down and they gave me a menu and they ask for your drink. I just got water. I ordered the 3 egg omelette & you can choose what you want inside. I chose sausage, bacon, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, red peppers (they don't have green), spinach, onions & avocado. It comes with hash browns & your choice of bread (toast).   It was delicious! But I had no idea how much it would cost. It was about $20 ($19 & some change). It's about the same price I pay at ihop. Still trying to find a breakfast place where I don't have to pay for each ingredient. So far first watch is the winner but they don't have hash browns just potatoes.   They also have a patio outside. They have alcohol."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! The server was fabulous and the food and drinks were perfect! Definitely a place we will come back to next time we are in Scottsdale! The Reuben & Kale salad were very good!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! Our sever was attentive and very sweet. Everything was so delicious and the environment was really cool! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool.  We were visiting Phoenix for a graduation and found Snooze on Yelp.  The first time we went for brunch, we had the breakfast tacos, the Sandwich I Am, the Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes, and the Breakfast Tacos.  No One had a bad thing to say about any of these choices.  We all enjoyed our food, the service was great, and the atmosphere more than cool.    The second day we came (yes....two in a row), we came with different family members.  Choices included the Sandwich I Am, the Breakfast Tacos, the Breakfast Burrito, the OMG! French Toast, the Spring Salmon Cobb salad, and the tomato soup and grilled cheese.  Again, everyone enjoyed their choices and reviews were rave.  When in town, we will be back.  Kudos to servers Joe and Drey. They were both awesome, attentive, and did a great job."}
{"text":"Went to Snooze for the first time this week after hearing good things about it.     I was underwhelmed with the food and the total experience.    Service at the bar was super slow.    The bar chairs are probably the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever experienced at a restaurant.   Has an employee or manager never sat in them?  Food is pretty expensive for mediocre size portions.    The overall taste and quality of the food was very average.    Not in line with the high price.    The facility itself is clean and big with a really nice back patio.  Overall, I would never go their again.   Too expensive for very average food."}
{"text":"I'd love an opportunity to shake the hands of the Schlegel brothers during my next trip to Denver to thank them for doing something that not even IHOP has managed to incorporate into their menu.  The ability to mix and match your pancakes.  You've heard of craft beer flights, but here they've got pancake flights.  Seriously, why didn't anyone else think of this?    At any rate, my first venture to Snooze was at their Town & Country location around 7am on a Saturday morning.  Even at 7am, the place was quite busy, though I was able to get one of the few vacant spots at the bar area.  As a side note, the last vacant seat at was taken up right next to me about 5 minutes later by none other than Phoenix Suns great and Grand Canyon University basketball coach Dan Majerle.  I guess this place must be popular, huh?  Thunder Dan sighting aside, I came here for one thing.  Well, actually three things.  A blueberry danish pancake with a lemon cream cheese filling, a sweet potato pancake with caramel and pecans, and a pineapple upside down pancake with cinnamon butter.  Oh and I decided to get a chicken sausage patty on the side because, well, yes.  Total cost for all this plus water, tax, and tip came to about $17.  Of the three, the blueberry danish was my favorite.  The lemon cream cheese filing is what makes this one and the sweet cream on top helps mellow out the acidity very nicely.  The pineapple upside down cake was my second favorite thanks largely to the cinnamon butter which I basically could put on just about anything.  The sweet potato pancake was my least favorite though it certainly wasn't bad.  Just a little bland in comparison to the other two.  If you're doing the pancake flight here, my recommended plan of attack is to stack a bite of all three at once.  That's pretty much the moment you know you've arrived in pancake utopia as I did.  The chicken sausage was fairly light and had a little spicy kick to it that I didn't expect.  Great breakfast (or more accurately, morning dessert) to start a Saturday.  Based on the morning traffic it seems like they get busy pretty much from the word go here.  Not Matt's Big Breakfast busy, but still pretty busy.  So get here early.  Snooze may have been born in Denver, but they've made Phoenician breakfast lovers (my friends and family included) swoon for awhile.  And seriously, find any excuse you can to put cinnamon butter on your breakfast from now on.  I know I will."}
{"text":"I hate giving only 1 star but my family just had a horrible experience there!!!! Great food but the service is absolutely terrible so we didn't even get a chance to eat. A \"30 minute wait\" turned into over an hour before our name was called to even get a seat. Just left the restaurant annoyed. They were giving other people's tables away to the wrong groups, customers were very frustrated this morning. Would only consider this place during the summer when they can handle the little incoming demand. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"I was expecting a wait due to the place being so new and highly hyped up.  I was pleasantly surprised when we were seated right away.  The place was pretty noisy (should really do something about the acoustics and maybe play more \"family friendly\" music)  I was SUPER excited as I had looked at the menu online and had an idea of what I wanted already.    My honey ordered French Toast neat - basic French Toast with some berries on top (nothing special for the price paid for it).  I ordered a breakfast burrito with the ranchero sauce (specifically because the waitress recommended that sauce) and ended up with green chili sauce.  If you are going to go out of your way to recommend a particular sauce, make sure you put the order in right!  Food was good, but for the price, I could have fed an entire family with breakfast burritos at home.  I am a firm believer that employees should have a breakroom to take breaks in.  Obviously, I don't know what the back of the house looks like and if they have one or not, but I should not have to witness employees literally PLOPPING down in the booth with their friends who are eating there like they are just relaxing in their own home.  This is super tacky.  There should be no reason for messing up when the place was not that busy.  However, on top of the previous notes, our waitress actually tried to get us to pay TWICE.  She brought the bill, we paid cash and said no change.  I was not entirely done eating at that point, so a couple of minutes later, she came to pick up my plate and brought the bill again.  I want to give this place a second chance as there are other things on the menu that sound good, but it might be quite a while before we go back."}
{"text":"Park in the parking structure right before you get here. $3 for an hour.  Adorable little restaurant with patio seating. Servers and host are super friendly.   Apparently known for their pancakes and they have pancakes of the day. We came in on a Monday around 11 am and we're seated instantly. Server was honest about her favorites. We had the mmm mmm mimosa and a spicy bloody mary.  I ordered some healthier eggs Benedict with broccolini and pesto Rice and the hollandaise sauce is some kind of cream cheese yummy heavy sauce.  They have funny names for the dishes but I can't remember them all. My friend had a lighter breakfast and both were great. Server brought out hot sauce for me and the food came out quick.  Very trendy and fun place close to the university.  Definitely see why they are popular. Great breakfast or brunch spot."}
{"text":"Great food, great experience, great service. Sat down right away on a Sunday morning. Our waiter was prompt and explained the menu. They had a special pancake of the day which was a white chocolate chip mint one. We said that sounds good and waiter responded with \"I'll bring one out on me just so you can try it.\" That was amazing. 5 minutes later our free pancake rolled out. It was amazing, and almost had a crispy waffle like crust. We also ordered a sweet potato pancake, and strawberry one. My wife ordered the duo of capersee and regular eggs Benedict. Both were amazing. I had the mushroom/ham scramble. Fresh good mushrooms and big chunks of ham. Coffee was amazing, and always topped off. When we were getting our check they even offered coffees to go.    I see other reviews of poor service, but we had the best service I've had in a long time. New places typically have a few growing pains first few weeks. Either we lucked out, or the service has gotten a lot better since the other reviews.   By far the best breakfast I've had in Arizona since moving here."}
{"text":"Good bfast option. Everything on the menu seems to be good except for the chicken sausage. Coffee is good but doesn't blow me away"}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos are delicious, mamosas excellent & service is OK! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"5 stars for our fabulous breakfast experience this morning. Jenna, our server, was so pleasant, and the food was second to none.   My boyfriend ordered the breakfast pot pie, with a half order of French toast (both were stellar) and I got the Benny combo, with the green chilli and the Bella! Bella! -- oh my gosh. Amazing.   For 8:45 on a Friday morning, this place was packed. We opted to sit on the patio, despite the cool morning temperature. Little did we know, the high tables are right next to space heaters, so we were plenty comfortable.   Despite the number of people, we received our order promptly, and as previously stated. It was perfection.   Definitely plan on returning here. Thanks Snooze!"}
{"text":"The food here is good. Very tasty breakfast n lunch menu. Capacity crowd at lunch though. Outside patios for overflow."}
{"text":"I have eaten at your establishment several times and have always been seated upon my arrival, except for today I was told that they NEVER seat you until your whole party has arrived. That's not true, so your front desk person just called me a liar and was rude to me while doing it. She could have easily offered me a cup of coffee while I waited or made any attempt to be pleasant with me. It was a huge fail in customer service.  Our server was sweet and she was tipped well for a great job. The food was ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I AM a fan of SNOOZE - (and for all I have to say you may want to take a snooze- or heck, you may even snooze before you're done reading...but) I have been to SNOOZE a myriad of times - and GENERALLY the food/service is outstanding. But today....eh not so much. Today is my daughter's birthday. She wanted to celebrate with a breakfast instead of the traditional dinner...and she wanted SNOOZE. (YES!- I thought to myself...love Snooze). I went online to see if I was able to make a reservation. Unfortunately, no. No reservations are accepted. No worries, my hubby and I will get there when they open and get a table for 12. Well, we got there about 7:20ish and they were already getting busy. Good thing we got there early, right? That really didn't matter, although they(Snooze peeps) were kind enough to let us wait by the window, they really didn't want to hold a table for that many for that long a time. People were to come about 8am - which was about 40 minutes from then. When I asked if they use the tables, would we still be able to get seated when everyone arrived. I was told the turn around is usually about an hour so  there would be a few minute wait. (WAIT? That's why we arrived early - - so we could get a table  large enough to accommodate our family). Okay...I didn't want to be unreasonable or worse a  B-WORD - so I said...well, okay....well, see how this works. If timing were to be on our side, the tables should come free before everyone arrived. EH..not so much. That's okay... I DO realize the world doesn't revolve around our family. SO.....we waited. And waited!  .....and after asking  (twice) if they could give an estimate on how much longer we'd be waiting ----well, they were kind and said it looks as if the people were getting ready to leave. We waited....and waited some more....until  finally, yes!, we are able to be seated. The server, whose name I did not see, already seemed stressed....(trust me, I know stress, so I can spot it!) He was quick to ask if we wanted anything to drink. Coffee, coffee, coffee is our reply... Several minutes later he comes with a dark beverage that should be hot - but isn't and should be coffee - but it is not. When we ask if we could have some hot coffee instead of the tea that was brought to us, he argued a tiny bit and said, \"no, it's coffee, it came from the same section\" - I was a bit perplexed and honestly, I really did not want to be a B-WORD but I didn't understand the \"same section\" comment nor did I grasp the thought that he didn't get that if everyone said it tasted like tea, why he didn't just say, I'm sorry, I'll bring another cup. He repeated the \"Same section\" comment and then said something about maybe we weren't used to their particular coffee bean. You know they grind it themselves (sarcasm noted). While he was trying to figure out the coffee/tea thang, many minutes have past...we still haven't ordered and quite frankly I was wishing we had gone elsewhere. While we did eventually  get real coffee, that wasn't before he told us that he tasted it and \"it IS coffee.\" Implying, I suppose that we don't know the difference between coffee & tea. I assure you, you don't need to be a coffee AND tea connoisseur, to know the difference! Okay, we order, he starts at the other end of the table...no problems here....until, he gets to my dad, who is sitting next to me. My dad is 84 years and, as people might be at that age a bit grumpy & hard of hearing- oh yeah, and set in his ways. He has every right. He doesn't like butter or anything that tastes like butter so after he ordered I said to the server just that - please don't cook in butter...perhaps basted? The server, said to me, rather curtly, he wants to hear it from him(my dad) because too many people ordering will surely make it wrong and he wants to be sure he gets what he wants. He actually reprimanded me for speaking on my dads behalf. He very well dismissed me and only wanted to speak to my dad. I KNOW this as true, because, well the server told me so. HELLO! I was aghast that this server would say this to any customer. I then asked him if he were having a bad day, because it seems as if he was annoyed before he started taking our order. I was trying to break the ice but he wanted no part of this. He quickly - and I mean quickly(!) dismissed me & my comments and said that  (again) the coffee was is the same section. Okay maybe this is some kind of restaurant lingo that I am not privy to - however, he seemed bothered by the coffee tea thang. By this time we were happy with our coffees and just wanted to celebrate the birthday. Fast forward - we get the ordering done, they brought the food out in a more than normal time frame - but given there were 12 of us, that is to be expected.   I have to wrap this up, It's too long. Basically, some of the food was cold (maybe it was in the \"same section\" but they did take it off the bill. Would I go back? Yes, but not with a large group."}
{"text":"Great find - cool spot by ASU (though the area was crawling with hipsters and basics - one dude in particular was trying waaaaayyyy too hard).  Anyway, cool retro-atomic interior (including coat/hat racks) - love it.  On to what's important.  Coffee - blah blah single source blah backpacking blah south america whatever - good coffee in a big mug with prompt refills - that's all that matters!   We got a pretty good cross section of the breakfast menu among our party - a flight of pancakes (one blueberry, one sweet potato and one OMG French Toast - all very good, but the OMG French Toast was the winner), a Chilaquiles Benedict, another spicy Benedict, a combo of Sweet Potato pancake and OMG French Toast, a"}
{"text":"Me and the husband came here on a Thursday 11:45am-ish. We decided to sit at the bar since there were alot of seats open there. I ordered the Bella Bella Benny eggs Benedict and it was very tasty with prosciutto meat, eggs, cream cheese, sauce, arugula, and a balsamic vinegar drizzle. The balsamic really made it good and was a nice touch. The husband got the Green Eggs Hammie sandwich but the bun was too thick for him so he ate it open face style. I would like to come back and try their mixed drinks (mimosa, bloodys) and coffees, they all seemed delicous sounding. I like the vibe here as it is a hip young spot with the pop music and bright colors. Good meal and would try again. Go during the weekdays as the weekends have long lines out the door. Our bill was $26.00 with two meals and one house coffee."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. This place was recommended to me by an acquaintance as a breakfast place must for my trip to Phoenix. Yes, the decor is cute, but the food does not match up--at least not what I got.   Our server was really nice and enthusiastic about the food. Because it was our first time there, he brought us his favorite pancake--on the house. I believe it was a pineapple upside down pancake. Unfortunately, we ordered before I was able to taste the pancake. I do not like the syrup they use here. It has an odd flavor that I'm not used to and that doesn't taste like maple syrup (and yes, I've had real maple syrup before). So, my french toast was not good, in my opinion, because of the syrup. But I got the french toast because it sounded good and it came highly recommended.  My husband got Juan's Breakfast Tacos, and I liked that much better. Perhaps other dishes are better, but I'd venture out to try another place before I tried this place again."}
{"text":"3 REASONS TO TRY SNOOZE  1. Bacon is served here (the good stuff).  2. Exceptional service...even when there's a bit of a wait.   3. The Bella-Bella Benedict with prosciutto, arugula, and balsamic glaze is downright awesome. It can also be ordered with a side of bacon. :)"}
{"text":"Being from Colorado, you would expect me to already know about Snooze. However, I had never heard about the ones in Denver so this was a surprise. Really glad we found this place and look forward to visiting the one in my home state soon.  We hit Snooze right after hiking Camelback Mountain so we were starving and ready for a hearty breakfast. Snooze did NOT disappoint!.  Tara ordered the Huevos Rancheros. She was convinced that she would need my help to finish it but it was soooo good that she got er done all by herself! I did get a couple of bites and it rocked! I ordered an Omelette with chorizo for some extra kick and protein. Like the Huevos, this dish was amazing as well. Very tasty and appropriately filling.  Our servers were terrific as well. One was from Colorado and was the one who enlightened us to the fact that this place got started there. Not only was she very attentive, she surprised us with the house special pancake as an additional treat! Like the rest of what we had, it was rock solid!  Next time we're in Denver, I'm hunting another one down!"}
{"text":"I went to this place a few months ago.. late post. We drove by this the other day& skipped it. We just remembered how NOT great it was. It was horrible!, no WOW factor at all. The wait for this place was a hour 1/2. Was told 30 mins not even!. Way to crowded inside, the tables are pretty much on top of each other. Hello neighbors? literally! The food was rated a D. in my book. French toast was filled with pure sugar, Hash browns suck,  eggs and bacon are okay. Bacon was on a plate only two slices for extra an price. Don't waste your time or your money.. go to Breakfast Club in Old Town Scottsdale or Downtown Phx there so much better."}
{"text":"The only thing that I could eat every day for a week is the \"pancake flight\" the pancakes are to die for and the choices of toppings are really well done. If you're a French toast fanatic they also have you covered. This is not your usual eggs and hash brown diner this is a legit breakfast joint and the best scratch pancakes and waffles and French toast I've ever had. I can't wait for the Gilbert location to open near my house!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to fall in love with the cuteness of this place but unfortunately I walked out pissed off & underwhelmed. First off, 30-45 min wait.. Not worth it. They might give you complimentary coffee but then they charge you on your bill $5!!! The server said I had the coffee at my table?! Yeah, I just poured a cup!!!! While I waited, why wouldn't I bring it to my table? Who charges 2.50 a cup anyway? Coffee is free refills at Overeasy ( best bkfst) .  Dried up chicken sausage and blueberry Danish pancakes was very underwhelming. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"First time at Snooze AM. Four of us arrived at 10:30 on a Monday morning and we waited 20 mins (spring break).   Between us, we ordered Two Benny Duos, a Scramble, one order of Breakfast Tacos and three coffees plus an iced tea. It all came to $60 plus tip. Hopefully the food matched the price.   My Benny Duo was a Bela! Bela! Benedict plus a Chile Verde Benedict. The Bela was excellent: good balance of flavors, texture and spices. The bread was toasted just right, the hollandaise was rich and thick. The chile verde was good as well but I had just had pulled pork for dinner the night before so it didn't thrill.   The order came with a side of arugula drizzled with balsamic vinegar, which was a good foil to the thick sauces.   The other dishes got good responses from my family. The service was almost adequate but a bit hurried. Too bad. For a $60 breakfast I would like at least some attention.   I would recommend Snooze AM for brunch but try to avoid busy times."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place.  I am so glad they are about 25 miles away from my home, otherwise I would be there every weekend.  The wait is a little long once you hit 8 am., however I am \"lucky\" the twins wake up at 5:30am everyday.  After getting ready and gathering everything we needed we headed out.  We made it just after 7:30 am.  The only sad thing I realized this time is that the balloon twister person does not arrive until 9:00am.  Oh, well.  I am here for the food really.  I almost had a repeat of the first visit, but I decided to try a different pancake this time.  You can make any kind of combos.  So I decided for the Chilaquiles benny and the sweet potato pancakes.  I am torn, I think I almost liked the sweet potato pancake better that the pineapple upside down cake one.  I guess I have to go again to make sure.  The chilaquiles benny were so perfect.  Instead of an english muffin is a tortilla base round, so yummy, with a layer of pulled beef barbacoa, topped with a perfectly poached egg then draped with this creamy spicy sauce.  Sooooo good.  The kids had pancakes and my hubby had a breakfast taco plus the chilaquiles benny.  This time I also enjoyed the blackberry mimosa and the hubby had the am margarita, which was so strong he couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"I don't care about the wait. I set aside my morning to eat here. The food is tasty! Their menu is original! The family has a good time. Breakfast at Snooze is more of an event than \"just\" a meal.  I make sure when we go on the weekends that I have something to talk about with my teenage boys. They do not like the wait, but it's a good time to talk to them because they have nowhere to run!!! 5 stars for SNOOZE!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, server was good. My complaint was with the bar. We put our name on the list and went to the end of the bar to order some drinks where 2 seats had just opened up. We asked for a bar menu while he cleaned up the plates from the previous guests. We explained our name was on the wait and he told us we would need to order from the well if we wanted anything to drink. Disappointed that we couldn't take advantage of these open seats, we respectfully stood out the wait. Not even a minute later a couple sat down in the open seats just to get drinks. I was a little confused but now with no seat or drink I decided to order a couple drinks from the other side of the bar as he had said. They we're busy so I completely understand a little wait. When I ordered 2 bloody Mary's and rather than make the drinks, his first priority was to present me with the bill. I thought it was a little unorthodox but I paid the bill and tipped. I then sat there for about 5 minutes after payment before receiving the drinks. I was a bit irritated at this point and I asked the bartender why he didn't invite us to sit at the bar but allowed the couple to sit there just a minute later. He said it was the policy of the restaurant and it wasn't personal. This didn't make much sense to me since we were also having drinks just like the couple who sat down after we were denied. If it is the policy of Snooze, best of luck to you. Ensuring customer service and comfort is a big part of the dinning experience. This was my first time to Snooze, but likely my last. There is a lot of great food just a few yards from there where the customer experience seems to hold more value."}
{"text":"I've only had their pancake flight which consisted of pineapple pancake, blueberry, and sweet potato and their spuds deluxe with bacon and sausage. I've picked up both of these items twice on the way home from a long night at work and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed them (believe me, he can be picky about breakfast). So far they never disappointed me. I do want to venture out and try an item from their art of hollandaise menu  but I think I will save that for when I dine in. This place gets pretty busy especially on the weekends and I can see and taste why. A must try for those who haven't."}
{"text":"Long wait but after tasting the food it was worth it. Had the benny duo with Chilaquiles Benedict and the Chile Verde Benny. They were very good. One of the fanciest breakfasts I've had."}
{"text":"Attempted to have brunch with a friend on a Sunday, decided to move to a different place since the wait was over an hour.  But curiosity brought me back on a weekday, with only a 10 minute wait.  Definitely, the best time to go for  brunch time treat!  Try the pancake flight for a variety of flavors.  The chilaquiles were tasty too.  It's been awhile, so this spot is definitely on my list for a return visit for an updated review."}
{"text":"If you have not come here, then you aren't living life with purpose. Great atmosphere, amazing food, wonderful staff. Was in town for 4 days and came here twice. Quality meets affordable pricing meets a great atmosphere. A+."}
{"text":"Good food great vibes and alcohol in breakfast what else you need. Really amazing cocktails and they have a ping pong table too."}
{"text":"Was in the area and googled \"Breakfast near me.\"  Lots to choose from on the menu. I went with the Eggs Benedict III. Excellent choice that hit the spot. Everything was on point, fresh, just right and tasty. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome environment. They are always busy which means there's usually a wait, but with complimentary coffee for those yet to be seated it's not so bad. Though it is a breakfast place I do wish they would be open later for those who have no qualms against eating breakfast for dinner :)"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! My friend's gluten free pancakes tasted just like regular pancakes which is unusual with gluten free items. All the food was tasty and with nice presentation. Coffee is very good which is of high priority for me. Service was excellent, atmosphere is trendy and fun. The only reason I gave 4 rather than 5 stars is due to the noise level. Certainly not \"average;\" is very noisy. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give it a second try because they were so busy the first time, my food took forever and was cold. Upon second try they took FOREVER and the food was cold again and not that good. And the check process took 30+ min. Not going back"}
{"text":"Its okay here not anything that jumps out at you.  Its pricey if you have a budget, and not kid friendly. We ate here last saturday and my son needed a highchair, all the staff kept bumping into him as if it were an inconvenience but there the ones who sat us in the middle and put the chair their in the first place.  We had to beg our waiter for refills on drinks im sure because they are super busy, and like other reviewers have said its a wait, we waited over an hour."}
{"text":"Been there twice, once during rush, once during slow period. Both times the service was slow and not attentive.  The menu is typical but has a few surprises, Nutella thank you very much.  Food is good, but long waits, and more importantly below average service makes me a bit stand-offish."}
{"text":"My go-to brunch place when I'm in the area.  Love this location due to the proximity to ASU, friendly service and the outdoor ping pong and corn hole games available to play while you wait for your food.  I've never had a bad experience here, the food is consistent.  Usually can't go wrong with the Benny Duo.  Only downside:  difficult to find parking, and long wait times (but you can reserve and get text message when table is ready), however all this is expected with such a busy and great place to go to!"}
{"text":"I've come back here on multiple occasions now and it has become my go to breakfast/brunch place. My favorite is the corned beef hash. I almost always sit at the bar or window because it's open seating and the bartenders are usually super nice and friendly. The silverware is still weird, but I've gotten over it.  Unfortunately, I wrote this review waiting for my food this morning and have to take away stars. My food came burnt (if I wasn't starving I'd send it back) and my Michelada was forgotten for a while. Not the usuals behind the bar I will say.   So it fluctuates between 3-5 depending on the day."}
{"text":"First time at Snooze today. Sunday, 10 AM, place packed but the wait was only a half hour for the six of us. (As we left, I heard the host say it was an hour and a half wait.)  Read lots of reviews about bad service but they seem to have fixed that issue. Our server promptly greeted us, offering menus and drinks.   After we all arrived, our server offered to answer any questions about the menu. She took our orders, which were: Breakfast Pot Pie, Juan's Breakfast Taco trio, Snooze Spuds Deluxe (2), Breakfast Burrito and Ham Benedict III.   They all looked and smelled wonderful. My Benedict was excellent: toasty English muffin, lots of chopped ham, poached egg and cheesy hollandaise sauce. It also came with hash browns. I asked for them crispy and they were perfect.   The hollandaise was lacking the tang of lemon but was much more savory than normal.   During our meal, a balloon-animal dude was cruising the place, keeping the kids happy.   Give Snooze a try but plan on a wait. There are some shops nearby, which help pass the wait time."}
{"text":"I went here and had the three different pancakes, chocolate and peanut butter, sweet potato and strawberry. I would go back for the sweet potato pancake, the other two I didn't really care for. I also had bacon, which was okay, I mean I don't think anybody could get bacon wrong. Overall, it was a cool place, busy. Planning on taking my friend up there, when she comes to town."}
{"text":"Great service! Boyfriend and I came and stopped by before heading back on our long trip to California. We got the deluxe spuds dish and split it. They were so nice to bring it out in 2 plates since they knew we were sharing. That's +1 service! Loved the atmosphere, the staff were smiling and constantly asking if there was anything else we needed. It was fun to see them busting moves to the music. Great location and hearty meal. Thanks for keeping us full for the road!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch at Snooze today.  I had a great experience during lunch a few weeks ago.  The food was fantastic.  The waiter at the bar was great and very helpful.  The manager on duty was outgoing and friendly.  Unfortunately, today was the total opposite.  The waiter/bartender was nice and friendly.  That's were the good times stopped.  I guess the cook(s) were ready to call it a day.  I had a simple order....french toast, 2 eggs over medium, and bacon.  The french toast was just toast with powder sugar sprinkled on top.  I can't believe the cook tried to pass this off as french toast.  I think the bartender was embarrassed.  She quickly returned it for me.  The bacon was badly under cooked.  I returned that item, too.  It came back over cooked.  I would have been embarrassed to serve this meal at home much less serve it to a paying customer.  It will be awhile before I return to Snooze.  I work in the area and there are too many options to have to settle for this.  Thankfully, the waiter/bartender was very pleasant."}
{"text":"I absolutely love snooze! The food is great, the people are great, and the staff is awesome! I also love St. Germain's Elderflower, so naturally, I loved the Palomimosa!"}
{"text":"I love Snooze! You can always count on a delicious breakfast & friendly service. Ordered the OMG! French Toast & my BF got the Sandwich I am - we thoroughly enjoyed both of our meals."}
{"text":"Great place. We wanted to try a new brunch place , near Tempe and saw this one on yelp. Great place, great food. Staff is friendly. U have to reach early coz usually waiting is 20 mins. About food - its awesome. Pancakes are mouthwatering. One must try pancakes definitely. The options on menu are lot. Will visit again. Soon"}
{"text":"Unique menu items.  Fun decor with good service.  We really enjoyed this restaurant.  Loved the potatoes, the pancakes and the omelette.  Good juice and coffee.  Everything was very fresh, and you could really tell.  We will return, although not with the kids, they can go to Denny's!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! I have gone here four separate times because I enjoy the blue berry pancakes and they have let me down EVERY SINGLE TIME. So very disappointing. The entire time I was there all times no one  came to fill up our waters and when we had to ask multiple times the lady was rude about it. I've had to ask three separate people to serve me coffee on one visit and all of them including our server forgot about our table. It is very poorly ran especially during busy hours/days. (and I've gone here right at opening when it's slow, still horrible service) I went with my sister on a Saturday morning to brag on snoozes pancakes and we waited 1hr  for a table. We wanted to sit inside and they tried to sit us outside when we told them we said inside they made us wait another 20 minutes. Finally when our table was ready they called us in and still sat three separate tables before us even though we had been out in the heat waiting for an hour and a half. Finally we are ready to eat and all our food comes out cold. For the prices they charge it is definitely not worth it. Very very upset with the workers and service at this establishment."}
{"text":"Weekends expect a 40-75min wait. Sounds ridiculous which kinda is but TOTALLY worth it! And you get free coffee as you wait. Otherwise come during the week! Suggest hash browns! The pancakes are pretty sugary but really good. Breakfast burrito is HUGE but so good. They are pretty cool about the menu. They will split almost anything for you. I suggest the breakfast tacos!!! And you must try a bloody Mary and their brewmosa!"}
{"text":"I'm such a frequent Snoozer. I've experienced a lot of really cool waiters/waitresses. I had Olivia today and she was literally the best. She was working with a great amount of people, I came in on a Saturday at 10am.. 30 minute but its a weekend! Anyway, our waitress Olivia was super nice, multitask very awesome and brought our drinks and food in a timely manner. Always very happy at this location out of all the Snooze in PHX!"}
{"text":"Waited for so long! But the food is incredible and or server was very sweet and attentive!! I had the omg French toast and it blew my mind..!! My girlfriend got the Bella Bella Benny and that was also incredible! And definitely try the apple juice, You know it's good when you can't see through the glass"}
{"text":"Spending a long weekend in Phoenix and out adventuring around, I dropped into Snooze for brunch.  From the moment I walked in and heard Erasure playing,  I was hooked. I sat at the bar and had the gazpacho bloody mary done spicy and the breakfast pot pie. The food was perfect (an absolutely perfectly done sunny side up egg!) and the young and friendly staff was terrific. Love the vibe!"}
{"text":"Wasted an hour waiting for food that came cold.  They don't even check it before they bring it.  Oh well it's cold.  This place does it every time they seat you outside on the patio.  It's the third time I've waited with guests from out of town to get let down.  I'll never bring anyone here again.  Let down central. It sucks waiting all morning for no food."}
{"text":"This place has become our Mother's Day tradition and it never disappoints! My daughter and I chose two different items each visit and they happily split our plates. This year we went closer to noon and were seated right away. The food is amazing, service spectacular and good atmosphere vibe. Don't blame them for the long wait, they exceed expectations every visit and they do it effortlessly."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday at 8:30.  There was a line up for tables on the inside.  They asked if we would like to go outside.  They had heaters going and it was most pleasant on the patio.  As others have mentioned, the ambient noise in the main restaurant is loud.  It was much quieter on the patio.  The background music was a bit loud.  We asked one of the servers to lower the level which they were most happy to do so.  Now....to the food!  I had the breakfast burrito.  I think one of these would be enough for THREE people.  It was huge!  Enough for breakfast for the next two days.  The wait staff were very attentive, refilling our coffee numerous times.  I was impressed that the food runner came out with our plates and without asking, placed all the orders correctly.  No asking who gets this.  Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a Wednesay to have brunch. This quickly became one of my top choices for brunch in Phoenix or scottsdale. Still a little too busy for mid week dining, but we were seated in less than 5 minutes. Egg Benedicts and pancakes are their specialty and you can mix different types. If you ask for their pancakes they'll bring you one for free. Overall great experience and highly recommended."}
{"text":"First of all, I have to say how amazing the follow up from management was following my previous review. They were professional and prompt in getting us taken care of and addressing each of our concerns. We went back today for breakfast and the food was outstanding. Service was prompt and friendly. We will absolutely be coming back! Well done Snooze!!       Previous Review: Ok so I have to preface that this review is not for the food. We didn't actually have a chance to EAT the food because everything else was so terrible.  We arrived at 8:30am on a Sunday to grab a breakfast with the kids. We quoted 30 minutes wait for a table. Not a problem at all! Took the kids across the street to grab some coffee from Bergies and to wait. After 40 minutes, go back to check on our time. Still a wait....30 minutes after that we finally are sat at a table.   After a little bit our server comes over (she was very nice but could tell she was hot and stressed out). We place our food and drink order right away together. We wait 40 minutes and food still isn't there. Server is no where to be found. Water is empty. It's now been almost 2 hours since we first arrived and still no food or anything.   We ended up getting up from our table and just leaving. I tried to find our server to let her know but again...nowhere to be found.   I would highly suggest hiring enough staff to handle the demand you clearly have!   I don't know if we will ever attempt to eat here again but if we do, I'll update my review."}
{"text":"My uncle recommended this place. It took me a minute to find since he said it was next to the Nordstrom, but it's actually next to a Nordstrom Rack (the word Rack is all you can see from the road). We finally found the place around 10:30 am but it was packed with a 20 min wait to sit inside. But it was still only 90¬∞ so we sat outside. If you sit outside make sure to go around the side where the misters are. Coming from the east coast I consider myself a bit of an eggs Benedict aficionado and these were some of the best I have ever had. In addition the service was excellent, no small compliment coming from me. I never waited for a refill or wanted anything, every time I needed something there was a server already asking me if they could help."}
{"text":"This place stays packed/busy! I was able to nab a seat at the bar and enjoy my breakfast. I ordered the Beat Sandwich w/ a friend egg and 1 plain pancake, delicious! My server, a female, was very nice and attentive. I had more food than I could handle, my own fault! Snooze gets very busy and the wait becomes long. I say arrive early if you can, the good definitely makes up for the wait."}
{"text":"So the food is pretty typical for a breakfast joint. The wait gets to be a bit much for middle of the road food.   About a month or so I go and the entire breakfast experience took almost 3 hours. Managers come and apologize as after all that wait, the food came out cold and wrong. Drinks never came.. just all around bad experience. Didn't even complain but management did step in and comp the meal and gave me a $25 gift card to come back. This is the reason they get 2 stars and not 1.   I go this weekend to go ahead and use the gift card I received and give them another chance. Long wait again, including a decent line to grab a drink from the bar while waiting. Finally sit down order a drink which made it finally at the end of the my meal due to an orange juice shortage apparently. Food comes out completely wrong yet again. Management again does a great job and steps in and comps my meal. I at least got to use the gift card on the drinks!"}
{"text":"I have been to Snooze a couple of times now, we go REALLY early to avoid the lines and wait times.  I have tried the breakfast burrito, breakfast tacos and the danish blueberry pancakes so far, and they were all great.  My nephew has been ordering the pancake plate which allows you to mix and match your pancakes, he didn't like it, but I finished his bacon pancake which comes with gravy and loved it.  This is a wonderful addition to all the new restaurants popping up in Gilbert, the service has been good, we will be regulars.  Try a game of corn hole or ping pong out back, my husband and I always have a very competitive game while there, so far we are even on wins !"}
{"text":"We visited from out of town based on a friend's recommendation. Amazing brunch food - sort of a gastropub take on brunch/diner food - and boozy coffee drinks were amazing!"}
{"text":"A breakfast must.. Bella Bella won't disappoint. \"The Flight\" offers a create your own 3 pancake choice. I recommend OMG French toast, Pinapple upside down and the sweet potato or the daily special. Coffee is great and so much more..."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and stop here for breakfast. Food and coffee is amazing. So many pancake and Eggs Benedict combos. And they are all amazing. Ask what the pancake of the day is... But you can never go wrong with the pineapple upside down pancake, or sweet potato, or OMG French toast. Can't decide, get the \"Flight\" and you can try three different pankcakes, or OMG French toast or fig French toast as one of the pancakes.  Eggs Benedict? You have to try the Bella, bella or Chilquilas. Corned beef, Lox... Can't decide, get two different ones on the same plate with a hash brown cake on the side.  Havana daydreaming sammie!!!! So much to choose from and it's all great. Check out the photos!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was ok. But not worth 1.5 hours of wait time. Warning... Bring a snack while you wait. Lots of wait time. Even the food coming out took a while.   The pancakes were good though. I guess that's the only positive note."}
{"text":"Over Rated! Nothing special....service was average/ food average ...  It's trying hard to be hip....  It's breakfast food...it's easy"}
{"text":"Not too bad! I had a 3 egg scramble that was very nicely prepared. I love that they have \"chicken sausage\" to keep the cholesterol down. Price was very reasonable, in fact, you could split one of their breakfast plates very easily because the portions are very large. I would be more incline to try some of their different hollandaise sauces on a Benedict or a spivey sauce on on of their Tex-next themed breakfast. But again, that's bad on the heart for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely, loved my experience. The food was great! Are server \"Rainbow\" kill it, she gave us a delicous pancake to try on her. All the servers were so nice and came up to us and talked to us. By far some of the best service I have seen. They didn't even know it was my birthday, and they treated me like it was. Thank you! I will be back. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"With fresh ingredients and loads of flavor, this spot did not disappoint! The food is excellent and the staff is friendly. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"THIS is my NEW FAVE Breakfast spot.  Awesome music and great food.  The wait is very long on a Saturday morning but worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Tried once not impressed.  Tried twice since it is supposedly the best breakfast chain.  Second time still not what it hyped up to be.  Crackers and Co and Henhouse are much better for east valley and many better places in central Phoenix.  First time was 5 months ago and I had a pricey and small French toast and a non-memorable Benedict. This time I had their lox omelette and pancakes.  Omelette was so small but tasted decent.  The hash brown it came with was good but perhaps too salty.  The Blackberry Sublime pancake was supposed to be \"loaded with white chocolate chips\" which I asked them to leave out because it sounded like a nauseating toothache with the toppings - black berries, graham cracker crumbles, excessive key lime pie sauce, and mascarpone whipped cream.  So without the white choc chips, it still ended up being waaaaay too sweet especially soaking in that key lime pie sauce.  The mascarpone whipped cream was unique and the best part.  They are always packed with a waiting list so not worth the wait for me."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of our favorite breakfast joints in the valley. Their food and service is always amazing and the only thing I could say negative about this place, is waiting for a seat. The atmosphere is pretty cool, and the outdoor seating is just relaxing.   If you like pulled pork, this is my favorite meal there!  Chile Verde Benny  Slow cooked pulled pork over a stack of green chile sauced tortillas and melted cheese with poached cage free eggs and green chili hollandaise, pico de gallo and cotija cheese."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal! Snooze is my new go to breakfast spot when in Phoenix area!! Be sure to come early to beat the crowds & from what I've heard try & avoid the weekends cuz the wait time can be as great as 2+hrs!!! The pancake fight is the best but definitely a shared entree, we paired it with an omelette (split of course) for the perfect meal! Our server Ashley was outstanding & we even got a free pancake of the day on our first visit!!"}
{"text":"Best on a weekday and before 9 am? to get seated right away. We both enjoyed egg dishes on our first visit and were pleasantly surprised with a complimentary upside down pineapple pancake. It was so good that our next visit was made? for this. Just know that it's more dessert than breakfast food. Funky and fun setting with the same type of server vibe. Service was attentive and never had to ask for a refill. Guilt has kept us from returning and falling prey to the above-mentioned flap jack o' heaven. Highly recommend this location as long as you heed the time frame."}
{"text":"Although the wait was 50-60minutes it was well worth it there is plenty to look at around while waiting! The food was great service was fast and good! Environment on a Sunday is very upbeat and fun! Definitely recommend checking them out maybe on a weekday of your not the waiting type!"}
{"text":"An hour and a half wait,  to have a sandwich, No problem if the Pope is cooking otherwise to heck with this place. Too many better places"}
{"text":"A very happening place for so early in AM. The wait is long but that's ok go to the bar & order a mimosa or a spicy Bloody Mary & lounge outside by the fire (which is a little ridiculous when it's 90 degrees... hopefully they turn it off soon but I digress) The food is worth the wait!! I had the Ham Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was by far the best I've ever had. The service was great (especially for how busy they were) The only downside was how noisy it was. It was hard to have a conversation (but that's a small price to pay for awesome breakfast food!)"}
{"text":"Cool place. Love the hash brown. Not a fan of hash brown but this place just made me love it. I also love their Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"I looooooove this place! It is well worth the wait!!!! The service is always courteous and prompt, the food is always so fresh, and the Orange juice is tasty! this was my second time here and so far I've tried their eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, the breakfast tacos, and pancakes. I have never been disappointed. I am really looking forward to my next visit to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"As you drive down the street to Snooze AM, not many places appear busy, except this place. It was packed, many standing around the hostess stand waiting for their text that their table is ready. Love the text idea and great they don't spam you with ads and such afterwards. We waited quite a bit to sit, longer than they quoted, but they are super friendly and have water and coffee out and offered to you as you wait, worth it!  The atmosphere and decorating are great, super modern, progressive and clean, bright and fun. The service was extremely friendly, from the host/hostess, wait staff and bussers.  The menu is enormous and everything sounds amazing. Ingredients are fresh, local, highest quality and dishes are creative, full of unique flavor and extremely well presented. Everything we had was absolutely delicious. We ordered way too much food because everything sounded phenomenal, and it was! Prices are a little high, but well worth it, really.  It's not close for me to go, but absolutely worth it. The pairing of excellent service, stellar, fresh, balanced, tasty, unique food, good value, and a really fun, bright, clean, active atmosphere make this a fantastic breakfast choice on any given day. Go, enjoy, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Dropped in to this place on a recommendation from a friend. Considering that it was 11am on a Sunday morning, the wait was only about 25 minutes and they texted me when our table was ready. I like that idea because it means we can browse around the shopping center while we wait. It also shows me that they support their neighbors by not restricting customers to a 10 foot area around the entrance.  I really like the open layout. We had a nice table on the patio, which was quieter than inside. I started with a Gaspacho Bloody Mary.....it's my day off and it's the first time in months I haven't had obligations, don' t judge ;-)..... The Bloody Mary sounded great on paper, but didn't live up to my expectations. I would say that it was the only thing disappointing about Snooze. I'm willing to be forgiving though because it really is just a brunch place and the focus isn't on cocktails.  I ordered the corned beef hash breakfast. The corned beef was amazing!!! Almost as good as McMullen's in Vegas. My eggs were perfectly over-medium and the portions were just right. Enough to fill me up without being so much that I feel like I'm wasting it if I don't eat it all.   My daughter ordered the continental. She said that the grapefruit brulee was the best ever. I tried it and it was pretty damn amazing. They fire raw sugar over it to give it just the right infusion of sweet and tart. She liked the Greek yogurt, but found the agave syrup a little too sweet.  To finish the meal, I ordered a Kentucky Coffee.....again, hey, it's my day off and my kid was driving.......although a little heavy on the bourbon, it was really yummy and completed our brunch beautifully. It also was responsible for the amazing nap I had when I got home.  Overall, the Snooze brunch experience was excellent and will probably become a regular place for me. I can't wait to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"WOW! This place was spectacular!! The service was stellar, the food was delicious! I went with my mom and the server was so sweet and polite we had quite an enjoyable time. We both had the sweet potato hash, which was the first thing I noticed on the menu, and it did not disappoint! I am usually a ketchup girl, but this meal didn't need any condiments, it was seasoned to perfection! I will be going back and bringing my husband who is a breakfast junkie! Well done Snooze, well done!!"}
{"text":"This is a case where the expectations created by seeing all the people lined up to eat here aren't quite met by the actual substance of the product or service. I had the Breakfast Pot Pie. I found the entire meal completely flavorless. The gravy had big uncooked chucks of carrots in them. The rosemary sausage didn't even taste like rosemary. Even the pastry puff didn't have that buttery taste you associate with it. I substituted a pancake for the hash browns.  It came out cold (the butter wouldn't even melt). When I showed it to the waitress she didn't apologize but told me it would take 5-7 minutes to have it remade. When a few minutes passed I told her to never mind then, I don't want it. She tells me you may as well otherwise we'll just throw it out (it's $4.00 up-charge which she DID charge me for) or you can take it to go. Who takes pancakes to go?? The reason I ordered the pancake was to have the savory and sweet combination but then I had to eat the pot pie first and missed out on the sweet. Then when the pancake finally comes out she gives it to me in a to-go box!? Could her message be any clearer? And guess what? They were COLD. The pot pie wasn't hot (but not quite cold either). They serve your meal with hot sauce so I'm guessing they expect you to add the flavor. I took off work to have breakfast with my husband at this place because I was excited to try it and thought it was special. Two meals with one cup of coffee with tip (yes, I'm not completely heartless) was $33. I would not ever go back there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places I have ever eaten at. My girlfriend and I ate at a location in Denver 2 years ago. At that time there was no AZ location...we checked. When we saw that there was one in Phoenix this morning the only question was how fast can we get there?  This location was just as good as the one in Denver. The staff was friendly and attentive. We were sat at the bar and then asked to move over 1 spot each so another couple could sit next to us. For our trouble (none) the waitress sent us a free pineapple upside down pancake. We ordered the Benny Goodman (eggs Benedict/lox creation) and the Pot Pie (spin on biscuits and gravy). Everything was great. Always busy so be prepared to wait. I would have no problem waiting for an hour, maybe more."}
{"text":"Whoa, this place was busy! But food was okay, and service was top notch. I had the huevos rancheros which looked better than it tasted (didn't taste bad, but not great either). Only other suggestion would be to turn the music down a tad because I felt like I was yelling to my server and my Guest at the table."}
{"text":"I love this atmosphere! Hostess asks us what's your favorite thing chocolate or pumpkin? We said pumpkin she introduced a pumpkin pancake and it was bomb!! And I like the food and the attitude of the place worth my money!"}
{"text":"This place is a great new addition for the breakfast selections around town.  Food is 5 stars,  unique and always tasteful.  Service is 4-5 stars with some good people and proper organization.  I like the text program for when your table is ready.  Wait is 4 stars since estimate on wait time is not accurate.  Place is very \"happening\" and people like to linger.  Great for friends and kid friendly.  Price is average (priced right for what you get) and I always am full when I leave.  Try the pancake flights, they are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast and lunch is one of my favorite weekend activities. Having lived in this area for over 20 years I'm always looking for a new breakfast spot. Located in the heart of Old Town Gilbert, it's probably going to be a wait every time you go. But man, it's worth it!! Spicy Bloody Mary's or Mimosas will hold you over while you wait out front by the fire. Inside you'll order a pancake flight or a flaky breakfast pot pie... or my personal favorite, the Eggs Benedict! You can order two different kinds, so definitely take advantage of that. And prosciutto with arugula and balsamic on top? Salmon lox? Yes please!! Everything is good here. Everything. Oh, and everyone was happy and nice too. I'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Mmm Mmm Mimosa. Ordered the French toast neat with hash browns. Everything was delicious and the wait staff was very nice!"}
{"text":"OMG!! This place is amazing!! First, the service is fantastic.  Our server was so nice and since it was our first time in, she gave us a pancake sample to try.  The food is delicious.  And there's so much of it!  The breakfast burrito is huge- could easily feed two people.  The eggs Benedict was a smaller portion, but really tasty, and you can mix and match from their options.  I wish I could come here every day!"}
{"text":"This was a new place for me to try.  Probably not coming back. Wait, no, I'm definitely NOT coming back.  I had the Breakfast Pot Pie. Nope, you can't call that a pot pie. Now, I've had pot pies in my time at other places and they're were actual pies. This was a square piece of pastry with a bit of something that tried to be a gravy. And it wasn't hot. Absolutely no taste at all. It was boring. Even the Tabasco was tasting like it was watered down. Who does that?  So no, I wasn't impressed with the food......at all. Service was great tho. That's all."}
{"text":"This place was great! The wait for a table wasn't that long which I was surprised considering there were a good amount of people already waiting. The service was great and the food was truly amazing! I got the Spud Deluxe and the best part was the bacon. Not sure where they found that stuff but it was very tasty. High suggest to any one who likes breakfast joints."}
{"text":"Don't eat at this snooze if you have any allergies. I have celiac disease, and they have made me extremely sick TWICE by being careless and giving me regular pancakes. I even ordered the second time with their manager because of my first experience. This location is awful."}
{"text":"When I go to a fancy breakfast place, I look for reasons to even be there instead of Ihop, Denny's, etc because A - its usually more expensive and B - its hard to improve on eggs over easy and bacon and these places are solid.    I was going to get the breakfast pot pie but from the description it seemed less like a pie, more like a biscuit and gravy dish with a pie crust in place of biscuit.  I'm glad I asked because that's exactly what it was.  So I got the BLT instead.  Yea, it had a fancy pesto mayo on it and some kinda soft cheese but other than that, its your basic BLT and regular bacon (described as soft belly bacon).  It was good, but not good enough that I'd ever order this again.  I tried my friend's 3-ingredient omelet (sausage, cheddar and mushroom) and it was kind of dense and flavorless.  The hash browns are better than I thought they'd be, as they were shredded potatoes in the shape of a cylinder with only the top part crispy and I usually like these fried parts the best.  Nothing really special about them besides the shape.  Really, the only thing I've ever heard people rave about this place is the pancake flight deal so I won't fully dismiss the place til I've tried a pancake.  I probably won't be clamoring to be back anytime soon though."}
{"text":"Sat down in 30 min( no problem with that) the blonde girl in the pictures basically threw the menu's and silverware at my son and I ( wow nice people working here$ btw she was just as rude when we first came in to give our name. We noticed her seating 3 other tables after us and handed them the menus and nicely put down the silverware.  We sat and watched the other 3 tables give their orders when in the first 5 min no one came to our table at that point I put on on my stop watch to see how long someone would come to our table so as you can see another 4 min and 49 sec past till we saw someone. Sure wished we were one of the 3 tables that were seated after us anxious to see who gets their food first the 2 top or the 2 , 5tops and where our 2 tops. Well we got our food first because I went up to the manager.  Now I do have to say our waitress is \"pancake princess\" that's what it says on the bill is very nice. Will I come to this snooze again? That's a hard call this snooze is a hit an miss"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!!!  Eaten here 3 times this week.  Had the egg white frittata today, not sure I've ever had anything this yummy in my life.  I've loved everything I've had before, but this was amazing.  Always have toorate service too.  Hostess staff are the friendliest you'll ever meet.  I tell everyone to eat here, you'll never be disappointed."}
{"text":"So looked forward to eat at Snooze and finally the third time was a charm  as typically there is 1 up to 2 hr wait so was extatic today to get seated immediately.  Wow was I underwhelmed ! I got eggs benedict and was disappointed.  The English muffins were small and chewy. The eggs had approximately a tablespoon of hollandaise and had to ask for more. My pancake was slow in coming and was so cold the butter would NOT melt so I sent it back. The only reason I gave 3 stars is because my friend ordered a breakfast burrito that was huge and delicious.  If I come back I would order that."}
{"text":"Will change or delete my one star review if the next time I eat there I can't here the music from the kitchen being played on top of the music already being played in the restaurant. Food is good but if I have to listen to two songs being played simultaneously I'll go somewhere else. Asked the bartender to have them turn it down and nothing changed. I suppose the atmosphere of the restaurant doesn't mean anything to the cooks. If there is a next time I won't sit at the bar. One. Song. At. A. Time. Snooze.  Edit: most recent visit kitchen music couldn't be heard from the bar."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot, laid back but it still moves. Retro design is cool. Staff is friendly and competent. Locals and travelers mixed together. The food, very good. Coffee good too. Great breakfast burrito, lots of fresh-Mex in the menu options. Interesting pancakes, and good standard fare as well. Visited many times in the spring, and the open air setup into the Caf√© is refreshing.  You've gotta go there at least once, it's a unique and cool spot with good food."}
{"text":"The food was just amazing.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  The coffee was top notch.  Our server was friendly, prompt, and courteous.  I can't believe this was the first time there and we cannot wait to go back.  They allowed us to split a breakfast meal and even put it on separate plates for us.  We each had a different Benedict and I will say the Elote Benedict is as incredible as it it unique.  We split a pineapple upside down pancake for dessert and loved every bite."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Hip restaurant & great breakfast.  Took a client here for a meeting and then went back the next day for more!  The peanut buttercup pancake was decadent.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Been meaning to write this since Sunday when we came in, just now getting a chance. I came in with my girlfriend and her sisters for the first time. We heard good things and wanted to try it out. I am not a university kid, I am a community college, rock n roll kid and I couldn't help but to scoff at some of the belligerent college bros stumbling out of some of the locations near by. No big deal, they need to have fun too I suppose! The wait was about 40 minutes, but the weather was nice and they gave us coffee. Some of the staff were nice, some seemed blah, but Kate (gosh I hope that is her name!) behind the bar was serving us and she was an A fucking + server. Best server I have had in probably years. Her suggestions were amazing, her knowledge about the food and drinks was ample and her smile was so contagious. Great service, nice mid century feel, and good food! The food was great, but not amazing (I know it is hard to do that with breakfast food) so Snooze gets 4 stars from me. If I could do 4.5, I would... Just cause the service was so good."}
{"text":"Visited some friends in Chandler last week and came into this adorable diner for breakfast! We decided to sit at the bar and ordered cocktails and breakfast. You could tell the waitresses there really enjoyed their jobs! They let us sample the infused vodkas before ordering bloody marys, recommended some great menu items and they were incredibly attentive and friendly! I will definitely make a special trip over there when I go back to AZ. How about opening one up in Chicago?!?"}
{"text":"The food was TO DIE FOR! My friend had breakfast pot pie and loved it. I had the pick 2 eggs Benedict. The salmon was amazing!! Barbacoa was really good but out shined by the salmon. Breakfast cocktails were also tasty. Service was good. No complaints at all. We both look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"My friend and I had breakfast and mimosas yesterday to celebrate her 21st birthday, the food and the drinks were fantastic. Our waitress (Liz I think her name was) was a sweetheart and very helpful and even surprised us with a complimentary birthday pancake for the birthday girl! I will definitely be coming back. Also, the playlist was epic. We had a Britney Spears dance party in the bathroom :)"}
{"text":"We give the staff 5 stars - Daniel was great.  The Food gets a 4, very good.  We really enjoyed the hash browns and pineapple upside down pancake.  The wait was very long (about 60 min), but they text you when your table is ready so we went to Nordstrom Rack for some shopping.  Not the place if you are in a hurry...but a great Sunday Brunch experience."}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing negative you can say about this place. Been to two locations so far and have left in digust...of myself for eating so much. Well my most recent visit I sat at the bar. I ordered and then was asked by a couple to move over one to allow them to sit. of course I did and what was I rewarded with? the ******** received my food and proceeded to eat it, when the server said something they just laughed and acted dumb like my eggs Benedict somehow looked like an eggs Benedict?! Not Snoozes fault but I wanted go fight this couple as I fasted for 22 hours and was STARVING. Well I ended up getting a double FLIGHT of pancakes and my eggs Benny. one of the flights was comped & well I ate it all. The servers and myself were both i impressed & disgusted. but hey it satisfied my sweet tooth & only reassured me that this place is still my no #1 brunch spot even if I come alone every time"}
{"text":"Best place ever and Vinny is a dream at whatever he does. Was taken here for Mother's Day by my daughter! Vinny wasn't working which was the only bummer of the day! We sat on the patio with misters of course and enjoy one of the best breakfast I have ever had and the special pancake of the day cinnamon crunch something or another they gave me lip balm of the same flavor! Who does that?! Snoozes that's who!! Hahahahaha great day! Sorry we missed you Vinny, but you know we will be back to see you!! Love Snooze!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Best gluten free pancakes. Since it is too hard to choose a pancake flavor...take the pancake flight...3 smaller pancakes so you can have more than 1 flavor.   Yes they also have goat cheese h fresh pabano chilies to add to your food!   My hubby had the eggs Benedict with quinoa patties instead of English muffins. It was almost too pretty to eat. There was a balsamic drizzle on top of the cream cheese hollandaise.  Yummmmmmmy!  Great coffee, service & adorable retro atomic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food, great service and the scenery is great!!!  I go to the Snooze all the time with clients in Colorado (Lonetree)."}
{"text":"Thanks toYelp for the great reviews and let me add to it as well. Waited 30 minutes on a Saturday super friendly wait staff and hosts. Spicy Bloody Mary was great but I wish it had a few more garnish like olives and celery.  Had the breakfast tacos with chicken sausage and it was fantastic.  Wife had the make your own omelet which was also very good.  Hate to keep giving kudos since there goes the wait times but this will be our place for a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Snooze is really great! I'm traveling for work and I was looking for a good breakfast place and this was closest to my hotel. My server was awesome and food came out FAST! And it was hot! I ordered what my server suggested and I was not let down!"}
{"text":"Having great time with family here for breakfast. The food is healthy and  tasty as well. Variety of menu to  be selected."}
{"text":"cool retro decor. but i don't eat ambiance.  the food brought me back a second time in two weeks. i had the blueberry pancakes. both times. and they nailed them.  amazingly yum. my SO had the scramble. done perfectly fluffy with rye toast and excellent jam.  coffee cup was never empty and the bean was great.  i had iced tea and was offered a  to go order on the house.  cool. our server was terrific.  wait for a table was not overly long.  love this place!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed!!!!  The first time I came here loved it.  Today I tried the Reuben with a side of black beans.  Omg!!!  Terrible!!!  The only thing good was the pretzel bread.  Meat was very dry and not the portion I imagined for the price.  The worst thing were the black beans!!!!  Looked like crap, lukewarm and had a terrible flavor.  The server didn't even notice that I didn't eat it and didn't asked if there was a problem.  I don't like paying $10 for a subpar sandwich.  Sucks!!!  I was really hoping to have the same experience I had the first time I came.  Lesson learned!!!  Not worth the wait or the money!!!  Damn!!! (Gordon Ramsey voice)  What a waste of $30!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. We have been waiting and waiting for our food. After waiting for over 30 mins we asked why it was taking so long. And seeing people who had their food way before us eating and almost done made it worse. Come to find out they lost our ticket. And out our food in until we finally called them out. After waiting 45-1 hr. We had our plates. Last time I'll be coming here!!"}
{"text":"Took my wife today for her birthday breakfast! Wow is all I have to say great food and the pancakes to much! So good!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry Snooze, I use to really love your breakfasts, until I changed my diet to plant based (vegan). If you are not a plant based eater, this will not be an issue as there is a massive menu to select from. But my last visit my option was oatmeal and having to take half the toppings off. I am surprised that with so much business and such a selection of breakfast items, there's literally nothing on the menu. Scramble has quite a lot of vegan options (8 to be exact) and is consistently good, though I like the atmosphere at Snooze better. Please include some plant based options so I can visit you again!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and excellent fresh food dining.   Service was amazing.  The Gilbert location is every bit as good as the ones in Colorado if not better.  Take a big appetite with you, the portions are above average."}
{"text":"I had the simple pancakes with sausage pattie. They are ok. There are better places around here for pancakes. But if I do come back. The sausage pretzel burger looked really good."}
{"text":"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. The size of their mimosas (and straight champagne) are huge just like their pancakes. They had a whole page of their menu dedicated to their crazy pancake concoctions and the best thing is that you can substitute the bread side for a pancake on any breakfast entree. I definitely recommend splitting a pancake if you can't eat a lot of pancakes; they are huge. The bacon was thick and crispy, but the hash browns could've been cooked a little longer. Our server, Shannon, was awesome."}
{"text":"I think this is only the second review I've ever posted in my life. Being in the restaurant industry for nearly 10 years, I've never been one to complain when dining out.  However, this was our second visit to Snooze and also the second time our food has come out completely cold.  After our first experience, we figured we would give the place another shot, as anyone can mess up, it's just part of being a busy restaurant, I get it. But our food came out completely cold for a second time!  Management and staff  were very polite and friendly, they did their best to make it right, even took care of our food (which was really nice).. But when you're paying $14 a plate for breakfast, it should come out hot and fresh. The food should always be priority #1, if you want repeat business.  I wish this place luck, but unfortunately we won't be back. Scramble has better food..."}
{"text":"Place was busy, even at 10 am on a Wednesday in midtown Phoenix. The holidays are behind us, so I can't attribute the volume to that six week long phenomenon. I seated myself at the end of the bar.  I wasn't planning to drink, but I saw the list of bloody mary cocktails in a stand up display on the bar and decided to take a look. Bangkok bloody mary: fish sauce, srircha, lime, cilantro, house bloody mix and some brand of vodka I can't pronounce. Many of my favorite ingredients are in this drink - what's not to like? Well, the weird garnish of dried up, unfresh cauliflower, zucchini, lemon and the peel of something was gross, so I tossed it aside. The drink was not remarkable, the interesting flavors not evident, but it was tasty as any bloody should be.  I knew I wanted something with green chile, so the Chile Verde Eggs Benedict choice was easy. I substituted the second for a take off on lox and cream cheese at no extra cost, a nice option.  The green chili version was good but difficult to eat. The crust on the corn tortilla was too tough to cut so the whole arrangement came apart.  The menu indicates there's melted cheese, but I didn't see or taste any. The second benny was just not a good choice. The flavors did not mix well, there were only flakes of salmon and by the time I tried it, the egg was stone cold.  The eggs on both bennies cooled very quickly, which indicates to me they may have been prepared in advance. The appearance was nice, but pre-cooking eggs is a shortcut that should not be taken outside of a free breakfast buffet at a cut-rate hotel. The hash browns may as well be skipped as they were a disk-shaped flavorless mush as hash browns often are.  The check was presented before I asked for it, which is a personal peeve of mine. I handed over my debit card and requested a coffee be added.  No coffee refills were offered and my water glass sat empty. There were open seats, so that was not the issue.  I want to really like this place, so I will go again. Everything was fine, but I want it to be great."}
{"text":"The breakfast was absolutely amazing. It took about 15 minutes for us to be seated which is great considering it's usually a long wait to get in. Once we were seated we had a nice waitress she took our order. Not sure if the kitchen was backed up or what but it did take about 45 minutes for the food to be given to us. Our waitress was amazing she filled our waters when needed and I'm not too sure about anyone else but my boyfriend and I don't like to be bothered too much when we go out to eat and she wasn't over the top with energy or too bothersome. It was a great way to start our day."}
{"text":"After glancing at some reviews, I wondered if they were talking about the same place. First off, my Diet Coke was flat! I ordered one pancake, which was cold, and was given a tiny container of syrup that didn't cover even half the cake. My husband ordered eggs, bacon, and hash browns. The hash browns had SO MANY ONIONS you couldn't taste the potatoes. He wasn't given enough jelly to cover even one piece of his toast. We had been looking forward to eating at this establishment, but will NOT BE RETURNING. ( music so loud that we could barely converse)"}
{"text":"Convenient location near ASU.  Fun, energetic atmosphere and a great place to wake up and eat some awesome breakfast.  Lots of nearby parking.  Free WiFi.  Awesome coffee and espresso."}
{"text":"Great location on the campus of Arizona State University and the parking garage is next to Snooze. I visit Snooze Austin TX when I visit there and will make this my breakfast location while in AZ. My favorite is the tofu scramble."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch but I get the feeling this is more of a breakfast place so I will have to stop back in for breakfast. The lunch menu is sort of limited , I got a Fall greens salad which was tasty. Clean & inviting facilities, friendly staff, reasonable prices. Four Stars, I will be back."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and I see what all the craze is. Yummy!!!! I had the pancake trio (great idea) pineapple upside down, blueberry danish and the sweet potato pancakes. Well the sweet potato pancakes were beyond words. Freaking fabulous!!! The blueberry Danish were very good but the pineapple upside down ones left a little to be desired. I imagined they would taste more like true pineapple upside cake with that wonderful brown sugar caramelized pineapple taste but that didn't happen. They were ok but I think they could do a better job on them. Now back to the sweet potato ones. Absolutely mouth watering. I can't wait to go back in and make them my main event. Service was good and the wait was not bad. Try this place for your next breakfast out you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"The wait time given was 30min. We had 3 adults, 4 kids. Actual wait time was 60min. Honestly believe they tell you 30min to get you to stay.   Free coffee during the wait. Got hot chocolates and OJ for the kids. The bartender wrote my kid's name in chocolate on top of the frothy milk. Nice touch.   Finally order. Service was decent, but could have been a little more attentive on drink and coffee refills.   Food was 3-4 Stars. Had the traditional eggs Benedict dish with ham. It was good. Hollandaise sauce was a little skimpy, but tasty. Hash browns were ok... nothing special. Kids pancake dishes were really small... single tiny pancake. Had to order more for my 8 year old. It was fine for my 6 year old. My 13 year old got the adult assortment pancake dish. He enjoyed it, but didn't finish it.   Overall, expensive ($110 for 3 adults, 4 kids, including the wait-time drinks), and a bit over-rated for what you get, but food was good and atmosphere trendy I guess, and the wait time sucked. Avoid if you have a large group greater than 6 unless you don't mind waiting an hour or more."}
{"text":"I come here way too often...their breakfast tacos are to die for as well as their hot chocolate. Sometimes it takes a little while for a server to recognize that your waters are empty, but that would be my only complaint. They're all super friendly, and they seem to enjoy working there."}
{"text":"Great CS on part of PAIGE and manager. Comes by table to followup on meals! Great service and followup surpassed all expectations. Lots of food choices. No regrets"}
{"text":"Seems like a nice place.  Kind of noisy.  My eggs and toast were cold but hashbrowns were good. My husband had the Sandwich I Am....very good"}
{"text":"Great service, not so great food. The coffee was good, but the steak Benedict was ehhhh and the fruit bowl was not good at all....and I really hate even writing this because the server was so lovely. The place was full, so I'm assuming locals really like it. Maybe I just ordered the wrong things..."}
{"text":"What a cool place! It's modern with a twist!! We sat at the bar area and our service was exceptional!  Our server girl was so adorable and sweet, I regret not getting her name :( she was fun and bubbly while being attentive and on point the whole time. I hot the OMG french toast and a side of the hashbrowns. Best hashbrowns ever and the presentation was so cool! The French toast was yuuummmy!! It's a busy place, so expect a wait, but it's completely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast options.  Celiac friendly options also.  One of the few breakfast places that balances interesting things that I wouldn't make at home, with classic comfort food options."}
{"text":"Just finished up another AMAZING experience at Snooze.  Don't let the wait scare you.  It's more than worth it.  The food is great and the service is even better.  I work in the service industry so can be critical.  Our server was Taylor and she is wonderful.  Always smiling, friendly and made for a great experience.  I would wait longer just to sit in her section. Thank you again and I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I am only leaving 4 stars because the place is soo damn loud you can't hear your table mates. The gluten free blueberry pancakes I had were fantastic!!! Better than Butters.... Which is where I usually go. Service was good, and waitress was busy, but attentive. Ambiance of course was loud, but the decor in the place is absolutely right up my alley!!! Id love one of those round tables and round booths for my own kitchen!!! Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Snooze is good. It's in a really hip area just east of downtown Tempe across from ASU that is almost like a small \"Mill Avenue\".  The restaurant (and the one right next door) are in  a converted original ASU building so there is cool architecture with lots of exposed brick. It's literally right behind Mona Aquatic Center (think ASU swim meets) and occasionally you'll see high divers practicing right behind the building.   Eat there on a morning when it's good to eat outside. That's the best experience. Nice waiters and well informed. Food is good and not just traditional bacon and eggs. Very attractive crowd at breakfast though you may find a long wait during really popular times on a Saturday or Sunday morning.."}
{"text":"I usually do not write a review on my first time going to restaurants unless I'm out of town and they have one chance to make a first impression.  However, this place is an exception.  I went here for my first time last week and we were amazed.  Now, we did go here during off peak hours (9am on a Wednesday) but the restaurant was fairly full.    Service was ok, a bit on the slow side but she was great.  Remembered everything and provided good suggestions.   We got a 3 egg omelet with hash browns and a side of pancake (yes, I was hungry) and the breakfast tacos.  A pleasant surprise, but they also have a full coffee bar!  So we had to get a latte... better than the chain coffee joint I must say.  Everything was great.  The hash browns were a little soggy on the inside but crispy outside.  Buttermilk pancake.... excellent!  Omelet, light and fluffy... compliments to the cook.  Most breakfast places certainly do not make omelets like this.  The breakfast tacos were also great and you get to pick what you want in them.    All in all, not your normal breakfast place so any comparison to IHOP, Denny's etc do not make any sense.  This place is not like them so do not expect to see the Grand Slam for $5.  If you are looking for a moderately priced breakfast place close to Biltmore, the 51 or that is centrally located, this is it.  Be sure to get there at a reasonable time, it seems like this place would go on a wait quickly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Snooze, but I had to deduct one star for this location because they completely messed up my order.  I ordered the pancake flight and my food came out significantly after the rest of my party and only 1 of the 3 pancakes were what I ordered.    Otherwise, I love this location - convenient to light rail and a great patio.  The pancake flight is amazing and the peanut butter cup is my absolute favorite...I crave these pancakes every once in a while, so can't wait to visit again and hope the service is better next time."}
{"text":"Say YES to breakfast at SNOOZE! I had the shrimp and grits it's wonderful savory with a kick of spice from some delicious sausage onion and peppers situation. The coffee really good to. When Food Vibe and Price makes me happy I slap 5 stars on the place."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Snooze location for quite some time now. Be prepared - there's usually a 35 to 45 minute wait. You will give them your phone and they will text you when your table is ready.  I still love their menu. They have great variety of breakfast foods - brunchy things -nice amount of a.m. cocktails. Like a brewmosa-beer with splash of OJ. Who knew?:)  Waiters are great. Food is fresh and hot. Love the all natural sourcing for ingredients. Such as using a local dairy for dairy products or using real maple syrup from Vermont. :-)  Even when they are slammed, you don't have a too long of a wait to get your food. Added benefit- they make tasty gluten free pancakes, for those who need items to be gf. Now if they could just add misters to the patio seating, that would surely earn an extra two stars."}
{"text":"I skipped my way here to be honest. I saw a picture of the pancakes and knew that I had to have them. Upon arriving I sat at the bar with Adrienne, whom I adore. I ordered half of the Benny Goodman and half of the Winter Benny, both were amazing. Adrienne told me about their pancake of the day (which was Samoa) I didn't think I could eat all of that food, so I didn't order one. She was so sweet and sent out a small one to try on the house! The whole staff was helpful and super inviting.    Side note they have amazing lattes (salted caramel was delish) and mimosas as well!"}
{"text":"So, it's hard to rate this place 3 stars when the food is so amazing. However, there is always a very long wait to get a table... And it takes forever for the food to come out. Not only that, but the hours are very limiting. The prices are a little steep, portions are a little small. I do recommend trying it at least once... Because, as I said, the food really is good."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff making it an ideal place for breakfast. Wether or not you just got off the last shift or having brunch with family or friends, this place has amazing drinks and great food. The Benedict choices are phenomenal and worth coming back to try them all."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Hard to get over all the hipsters though. It's like Seattle but with sun and no rain in that place..."}
{"text":"I love eating here. The service is always prompt and the food is wonderful. I would recommend getting there early. It is always packed when I go. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying this would have been a five star review but unfortunately we found a hair in our pancake so I had to take it down because of that.  The manager came over and apologized they of course took it off the bill. But even with a hair I will be back. The atmosphere is very welcoming the food is delicious and service was great. We tried a few different things on the menu. I had the snooze spuds deluxe which is literally a mountain of hash browns topped with cheese and your choice of meats. As simple as it was it was delicious. My husband had chilaquiles Benedict all I can say is AMAZING!! This is not your traditional Benedict but they nailed the flavor it's almost as good as the ones we make at home. He also had the chile verde Benny which was also delicious! Since this was a new restaurant for us we decided to go big or go home and decided to share a blueberry Danish pancake and OMG it was heavenly....had there not been a hair cooked in the middle I would have eaten it all and licked the plate clean. This place also serves alcohol and that made our brunch even better :)"}
{"text":"It was pretty good but not great. The pot pie itself was good but it got kind of tiring to eat after a while. The hash was bland IMO but maybe I just have very salty taste buds.  I'm sure a lot of other items on the menu would have been good, but I just didn't get the best. They also have very interesting alcoholic drinks that I wanted to try, but didn't have a chance to.  Service was great. The employees there are very nice. It was a nice sunny day out so we sat outside with the umbrella. It felt so nice.   Overall I would recommend coming here, just ask the server for the recommended item :)"}
{"text":"Wait is too long on the weekends, so we go on the weekdays.   The Breakfast Pot Pie is SO GOOD. Rich, but tasty! You will be full when you leave. I also have had their 'classic' Benny. Eggs were cooked perfectly. For me, the smoked cheddar hollandaise was a bit too rich, but to each their own. Would love the option for a regular hollandaise...but that's just me being picky.   The coffee is flavorful.   The French toast is lovely, too. I love the atmosphere! Our waitress was friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went with my friend on a Thursday for brunch. We are both 19 and the server treated us differently than she did with her other tables who had older people. The food took a while and another table who ordered after us (with 2 people as well) got there food almost 5 minutes before we did. We ordered a single pancake and then a snooze classic. Didn't know it should take that long for that order. The service was bad and we asked to split our check after she brought it to the table. She ignored us for another 5-10 minutes and never brought us a split check and instead said we could give her our cards and she would split it for us. She then walked away AGAIN as we were getting our cards out so we had to wait longer. Finally another lady came and took our payments and got us our cards back. I've had a few problems with the location now and I don't intend on going back anymore. The servers are rude and they focus more on socializing with their co-workers than they do on taking care of paying customers."}
{"text":"UH-MAZE-ING is the best adjective to describe this delectable eatery. While in town visiting, and then reading the reviews regarding this establishment, it became a required stop. I am a true fan of eggs benedict and this place has a variety of benedict concoctions. Absolutely delish! In addition, the carrot cake pancakes make you wanna slap yo mama!  Definitely a must try, you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!  :)"}
{"text":"Visting from Texas and was looking for breakfast and going this place. The BEST pancakes I have very eaten and the service was AMAZING!!!! My husband had corn hash beef and I had ranchero eggs and it was delicious!!! We ended up eating here two days in a row!!!"}
{"text":"I liked this place.  We had to wait around 40 minutes on a late Saturday morning.  The service was great.  Ambiance was a fun 70s type theme.  Ended up sitting outside and enjoying the weather.  The menu is so fun for foodies.  My daughter and I ended up sharing a Benedict flight that included a Mexican style Benedict and an Italian style Benedict with prosciutto.  Both were good, though I enjoyed the Italian style one more.  We also shared a pancake flight with pineapple upside down pancake, white chocolate with hot chocolate drizzle and homemade marshmallow and blueberry streusel.  All were good but not great.  So glad I tried this place but TC Eggingtons is still my favorite for breakfast in the valley."}
{"text":"Snooze has the most creative pancakes I've ever tasted/ heard of! I tried the pineapple pancakes, literally little pineapple bits in the pancake with brown sugar on top. Soooo good. I also had the pecan pancakes. They are very large pancakes and can share with 3-4 people. Iced chai tea is really tasty. I ordered the \"sandwich I am\" on the menu because it sounded delicious with bacon, a fried egg, and hollindase sauce on a pretzel bun.. But somehow she put in a different breakfast sandwich instead. I ended up with the BEAT sandwich.. Served on cibatta bread with bacon, tomato, an egg, and aioli sauce. It was alright but I would preferred the one I ordered. Has browns are very crispy on the top and soft in the middle. They are generous with their sides of fruit. Friendly staff with dog-friendly patio seating."}
{"text":"Outside dining available. Portions were very good and food was very tasty! Gluten free options available for pancakes and toasts. Server was very helpful in describing the dishes."}
{"text":"I'd been here a couple of times in the past, and not been too impressed with the service. Went back Sunday, July 31st and have to say it was definitely a great experience! Paige (our server), and Ramon (working the bar area) made it such a great experience. Paige was very friendly, helpful, and patient when my girlfriend and I were deciding on what to eat and drink. Ramon, was very helpful a in helping my GF decide on a cocktail. We'll definitely go back thanks to the great service experience we had!"}
{"text":"Nice patio, very relaxed atmosphere.  Get there early to not have to wait. But if you do wait, it's worth it.  Good food and great service."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Delicious.  The downside is that it may become an addiction.  When friends or family come to town this will be my go-to place for breakfast.  The pineapple upside down cakes are beyond belief.    I've been four times, have tried something new each time, and each time thought it was fantastic.    Love the decor and the staff is very courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Pineapple Upside Down always flips my frown. Try their pancake of the day or stick with the favorites. My wife loves the egg white and spinach thing. Arrive early and drink coffee while you wait. It's totally worth it. I've visited all the locations in AZ and Colorado and their service is always great."}
{"text":"Long wait to be seated, and an even longer wait to get our food! Unless you have 3 hours to kill, I wouldn't recommend this place. Our server, Madison was extremely rude and unfriendly. The food was just ok and not at all worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've been to this location two times. The first was just a normal brunch, the second was a group event (30 people) and was for my rehearsal brunch. I worked directly with Travis Todd, the General Manager. He was extremely accommodating and his communication was on point. We sat out on the patio and he reserved several tables for us. Everyone absolutely loved the food, and it was an enjoyable experience. I would strongly recommend planning a group event here, as the staff is awesome."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from some friends and was anxious to try it when visiting Arizona. And it did not disappoint!  There was a little bit of a wait to get seated but we ended up sitting at a shared high top table which was fine with us.  There were a variety of delicious options to choose from on the menu, along with some tasty mimosas! My husband and I both tried versions of Eggs Benedict. I had the Early Harvest Benny and he had the Benny Duo - Ham Benedict III and Chile Verde Benny. Both meals were excellent! Great flavors and very reasonably priced. I loved the griddles cauliflower, green harissa and poblano pepper quinoa cakes! I really wish there was a Snooze in GA so I could try some of their other delicious menu items!"}
{"text":"The first time I had Snooze was in San Diego, so when it finally opened here I had to see how it compared. Just as amazing as I remembered it and just as busy!   My boyfriend and I were able to get in and out quickly by eating at the bar Sunday morning.   I will have to try the pineapple upside down pancake next time. Last time, I branched out from decadent pancakes and tried the breakfast tacos + chorizo. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Great place! Loved the overall aesthetics of the establishment as well as that of the food! Food came out promptly and was delicious! Staff is super friendly. The only concern we had was on of the desserts served a banana that still had the peel on it- which made my sister upset!   Great meal overall!"}
{"text":"Central Phoenix is in desperate need of quality breakfast joints that open before 8 or 9 am. Snooze offers delicious food, good service, and really, really loud music.  I love the high music volume at 6:30 am because that, along with the coffee, really jolts me awake!"}
{"text":"The sinful pancake was bomb!!!!! Vinny is an awesome bartender/waiter/barista, whatever he is."}
{"text":"Love the decor. Love the laid back atmosphere.  Absolutely HOOKED on sweet potato pancakes (ask for syrup on the side) and the B.E.A.T. which is a symphony of flavors all coated in runny egg yolk (just let it happen, don't overthink it).  Fun! Flavorful! Reasonably Priced!  Breakfast for Lunch - Oh Yes!"}
{"text":"Found a hair in my omelette so they brought me a new one. Found another hair and they didn't even acknowledge it, they said it was a fuzz. The person I was with found a hair in his orange juice. Definitely will not come again."}
{"text":"Kind of over this place. 60 minute wait yet there were a dozen empty tables. They need to get it together. Snooze has good breakfast, but not good enough to tolerate inefficient processes."}
{"text":"Yum! Cool atmosphere, great music and delicious food. I'm not giving it 5 stars because I didn't have anything I couldn't live without, but I would definitely recommend it and will go again. Liked the Bella Bella Benedict and the sausage gravy best but everything was good. Subbed a pineapple upside down pancake for toast on one meal and 4 of us shared it as a dessert. Couldn't imagine eating more than that - it's great, but a lot of sugar. Bloody Mary's were ok. Oregano's and Carly's still have the best of those in the valley.   You're going to have at least a 30 min wait and maybe closer to an hour or more depending on when you go, so go shopping at My Sisters Closet and they will text you when it's time to head back over. It's a nice feature since they don't take phone reservations."}
{"text":"A good chain restaurant to enjoy those traditional (fatty) breakfast favorites. Quite possibly the best-tasting pancakes in the world. Need more healthy options, though, as well as a more complete coffee menu. (Their coffee drinks are not good.)  The biggest challenge with Snooze is the incredibly long wait to be seated --as much as 2 hours on weekends. Also, the foods on the menu should be a rare treat, not regular fare."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago (March 1st to be exact), I had my wedding rehearsal at my venue down the road and the plan was to come to Snooze for brunch. We had a group of about 20 people and not wanting to be rude, I wanted to make a reservation. Apparently there was a miscommunication as far as the reservation goes, but I had a text message from someone who works at this location that 'the manager is not very happy about it, but there is a reservation.' Fast forward to going to ask for our table and apparently 'there is no record of our reservation and they will not be seating us together'. I get the fact that it was a large group, but the manager who was working that day was extremely rude about it. I still have the message about the confirmation. Not something a bride to be wanted to deal with."}
{"text":"This place is not only AWESOME, but the food tastes great! Went every Sunday for football, the bar staff is great and a fun environment."}
{"text":"We went around 9am on a Saturday morning and had a minimal wait. Great outdoor seating area, with ping pong and cornhole games. Brunch was awesome! They have several great eggs Benedict options, and you can mix and match two together. I had one with smoked salmon and another roasted vegetables on top of griddled roasted pepper grit cakes (Late Harvest Benny). We tried several mimosa variations, all good. Service was spot on - very attentive and never rushed us out of the table, even as the place got busy (and it gets BUSY). Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The shrimps and grits was so bomb I will definitely be coming back for them and there regular breakfast looks really good too and I can't wait to try it out"}
{"text":"This was my third visit. It's good but not great. First two visits did the bennies and they were good, very different flavored, but not spectacular. Potatoes were cold on both visits. Today , had the huevos and was not impressed at all.  Sauce was good, but could have used a flavor boost and I missed my rice.  Eggs were over easy but weren't cooked enough and there was an extreme excess of uncooked whites. Coffee was okay but expected a bolder taste, so this time ordered an Americano. Definitely need to boost this up. It was half a mug of lukewarm coffee, and lacked the boldness usually associated with an Americano. We had to sit outside, and there are no misters. You really need them as it was hotter than blazes in the courtyard with no breeze. It's decorated wonderfully, but food needs a bit of improvement. Not bad, but misses the mark consistently."}
{"text":"Worst service ever; we waited 45 minutes for a table & they put in the wrong phone number to contact us so we lost our would be table to another group of people. Didn't want to wait around any longer so we left. I don't know if the food is good or not, but the service today was terrible."}
{"text":"It was an early practice day for me. I was preparing for an upcoming tournament, and by 5:30 AM; I was famished and wanted some breakfast to top off the morning.  So, I went all the way back home and dragged my Beloved wife out of bed and took her to this establishment.  By then, it was 7AM; and I wasn't really expecting a long wait - or so I told my wife. After all it was Saturday morning. Well, I was wrong! The place was packed, and there was at least a 20 minute wait.   There was a Dad and his teenage son playing ping pong, and the Dad asked if I wanted to play his son seems he had trouble beating him. Before I could even say yes, and run to the car to grab my custom made Table Tennis paddle; my wife gave me this look that basically said \"Stephen, do you really want to humiliate this teen in front of his dad?\"   I was in a quandary, but just in time; the hostess tracked us down and let us know that our table was ready. Situation averted!  We were sat down in a small table, in between two very friendly older couples that just wanted to chat up a storm. My wife was half awake, but I am my normal self and engaged both of them in small talk - nothing serious.   Our server was promptly took our orders, and throughout this experienced; proved to be extremely cheerful, competent and attentive. In spite of the competing demands of various tables that he had to wait upon, he didn't miss a beat.  And then came our meals. My wife had the Drunken Monkey French Toast. She joked that this dish reminded her of the times that I used to compete in Kung Fu competitions in the Southwest. And some of my form styles were the Drunken Monkey and the Monkey staff.  I thought it was cute that she tried to make a joke being only half awake, but she definitely woke up when she tasted her French Toast; because it was simply amazing!   The toast was light, as well prepared. Sweet, but not too sweet. It tasted way better than it looked. This was a home run as far as her selection was concerned.  I had the Snooze Classic, which came with Bacon, Eggs, Toast, and Hash Browns. And for good measure, I add a side of Plain Pancake as well.  The Bacon stood out for me because it not only was of a thick cut, but it was well prepared and not overdone. And that Pancake was so nice and fluffy. I considered ordering on more, but restraint prevailed.  Between the bustling atmosphere, great service, and the friendly patrons; it truly made for a great opening to a wonderful Saturday!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in while visiting from Texas great food great service great atmosphere!  Do yourself a favor and have some breakfast."}
{"text":"Snooze is my absolute favorite breakfast place in the country...hands down!  I have now been to their locations in San Diego, Denver and Phoenix...ready to tackle more locations too!  This time I tried the pancake flight of strawberry malted, blueberry danish and peanut butter cup pancake...all I can say is yummy!  If you haven't tried the peanut butter cup pancake, you are most certainly missing out!    The wait can be long, but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Yes sir! When in Gilbert Az, you have to stop by Snooze, the French toast will make you slap your momma! The egg whit frittata was excellent and bring your patience because you will wait a while to be seated, plan on arriving before 8am on the weekends. The only bummer is the don't serve waffles"}
{"text":"BEST BRUNCH in Phoenix?! Yes x100!  Brunch is my favorite meal ever and I don't take it lightly. The same goes for my husband. We've read tons of Phoenix articles and searched on Yelp, trying to find the best brunch spots. Snooze would occasionally appear on our search. Most Saturdays, we like to take full advantage of sleeping in on the weekends, after busy work weeks. We would hit snooze on our alarms and ironically never make it on time to Snooze the restaurant haha. It's closes at 2:30 pm. You know the best brunch places close early.  So FINALLY we got up early in the morning, got errands and cleaning done, with enough time to check out Snooze an AM Eatery. And let me tell you, this has to be one of the best brunch experiences we've ever had!  I'm from Los Angeles, so I've had my fair share of great brunches. Snooze has made it to my top 3 now.  DRINKS -- There is a great selection of unique drinks! We had the Dirty Drunken Chai and it was so good. We drink dirty chais weekly, so an alcoholic version of a chai latte made our weekend. Also, we had to try the mimosas - pomegranate and cherry. Pomegranate was better, in my opinion. Not a big fan of cherry flavor. But for cherry lovers, I'm sure it'd be tasty.  FOOD -- The food is soooo delicious!  My husband had the corn beef hash and loved it. He had something to say every time he took a bite, like,  \"this is the best corn beef I've ever had...  best tortillas... soooo good.\"  I had the chile verde benedict - with soyrizo for my meat, avocado instead of eggs, and vegan** hash browns!  + side of black beans (big portion for a side too)  **FYI vegans - the hash browns are not vegan, but they'll gladly cook a non-dairy version for customers. I'm so glad our server let us know in advance that they weren't vegan and offered a vegan version. Yay, a vegan friendly restaurant that doesn't make you feel bad for making vegan modifications!!  Also, we had the 3 pancake sampler! Peanut butter, mocha, sweet potato pancakes. Sometimes eating normal size pancakes is too much and makes you feel bloated. But these were the perfect size to share, try different flavors and fulfill a pancake craving.  SERVICE -- P-h-e-n-o-m-e-n-a-l ! And fast! Our drinks and food came out quick. Most of all, our server was Nikki and she was the BEST!! She was so genuine, personable, friendly, and kind. If there's anyone that knows the art of customer service in the restaurant industry, it would definitely be her. This lovely woman deserves a raise or a promotion (and employee of the month - we nominate her!),  because she knows customer service like no other. Nikki made my husband and I feel so comfortable and right at home. Because of her and the superb brunch food, we will be back and want to be usuals!  Thank you SO much to Nikki for the amazing, 5 star customer service!! And to Snooze for the wonderful brunch!"}
{"text":"I love this new place especially the location is perfect right off the 51. My first time coming in and I met a wonderful elderly couple as much as I enjoyed my breakfast I enjoyed them so much more. Great service great employees, everyone is so friendly. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Snooze is a fun place. There's sort of a vintage, 60s vibe about it. Personally, I love the sweet stuff, so I usually get a flight of pancakes (you can pick any three pancakes you like!) My boyfriend likes to get something more savory, like a burrito or chilaquiles. I feel like there's something for everyone at snooze!   It's usually super busy, but it's worth your wait."}
{"text":"Best breakfast around! My brother and I go every Sunday and I look forward to it all week. Great menu, something for everyone, and lots to try! Great friendly service as well. Love this place"}
{"text":"The food here is great! Only disappointments about this place is that every time we have gone it's about a hour wait. Once we were finally seated they take another 20-30 min to bring out the food. I understand they are busy but it really takes way too long to actually get your food at the table. If you have time to wait and have patience for the food to come out, the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place for a quick breakfast while staying in Phoenix. The place is nice and has a welcoming atmosphere. It's relaxing with a pingpong table and other games for customers to play and chill out. The service was good and quick.  The food is ok. I had the benedicts half ham and half chilaquiles. The ham was good but the chilaquiles was a little plain. My friend got pot pie and I think it has a better taste than the bendicts. In general the place is ok for casual breakfast with typical dishes.  Other thoughts: they have a list of very interesting drinks/cocktails. I didn't try any of them since I was on a rush to see other places in the city, but I would definitely try some of them next time when I have more time"}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience !! Server was amazing! FOOD WAS EXCELLENT!! DRINKS WHERE AMAZING!!! DEFINITELY GO HERE!!! The wait time was 30 minutes , but it was certainly worth the wait. I would come back and recommend to all my friends!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! This was the best restaurant I went to breakfast for in Arizona! The service was great, the food looked and tasted beautiful. By the time we were done eating there was almost nothing left on the plates. I hope I can come here again when I come back to Arizona. I definitely recommend the blueberry danish pancake, and the Bella Bella Benny. It was great! I would get it medium though, not their normal because it was too runny in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is not like your typical breakfast/brunch place. The menu is very different and the flavors are robust. Great place for out of town guests or a lazy Sunday. Always a wait, so plan on 30-45 mins for a table. Well worth the wait however and there are games to keep you occupied."}
{"text":"Came here and had breakfast on a turnaround trip with my sister and it was by far one of the best places I've ever had breakfast. They give you free coffee while you wait and waiters circle around while you wait for your table asking you if you need anything from the bar. Five stars all the way"}
{"text":"Loved everything about SNOOZE!!  Mimosas were delicious!  Fun atmosphere and great food!  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Retro look, great menu and excellent food.  Only downfall was the bathroom wasn't too clean..."}
{"text":"This place's food is sooo good. Very good eggs benedict, very good peanut butter pancakes. These people got it going on, I highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Food was cool and mostly flavorless. This is our third trip and we won't be coming back. Denver location is awesome, five star, PHX needs to go for lessons in food prep and customer service."}
{"text":"Just ate here based on all the great reviews. It's Saturday so we expected a wait but we don't mind waiting for great food. I ordered the Chili Verde Benny and my husband got the Corned Beef Hash. The Corned Beef Hash was a huge disappointment so I ended up giving my husband half my Benny. The Benny was good but NO part of our meal was worth the 1 hr and 15 min wait."}
{"text":"Snooze is perfect for breakfast. This location is always packed since it's so good! Definitely worth the wait if you have time. Side of hash browns are amazing and served different than any other restaurant! You'll have to see the hipster breakfast joint for yourself!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to stop in and have breakfast here on a Sunday. I was not surprised by the wait and line once I arrived. I knew that this location is ALWAYS busy. Surprisingly, I got a table within ten minutes of checking in with my husband. Yay! Once we arrived at our table our waitress came to take our drink and breakfast order. Minutes later...our food was already delivered at our table. Talk about FAST! Our food came out so delicious. So delicious that I don't want to order anything else on the menu because I already fell in love with the first item I tried. I recommend coming early because they don't take reservations in advance, they're kind of a first come first serve type of restaurant. They're dog friendly. So, come and bring your pooches! If you're unable to find parking, the best option is to park at the nearby parking garage. Not many restaurants offer military discounts, but this Snooze location does!"}
{"text":"Amazing addition to the Biltmore area! This is the best breakfast place around (get here early to avoid a long wait, especially on  the weekends). But to fill the void of waiting, Snooze so kindly enough has complimentary coffee from Guatemala for the customers waiting.   I have been here numerous times already and everything we tried is delicious. Highly recommend the pancakes. The pancakes are light, fluffy, sweet and never get soggy. OMG French toast is another hit. Corned beef hash, eggs Benedict, just plain eggs, Juans breakfast tacos would all be ordered again!  Make sure to come on an empty stomach - it's worth it!"}
{"text":"So yummy! Good coffee, had a Bananutella pancake and a breakfast taco. The pablano hollandaise sauce makes the taco. If you're new to this place, they will do half orders on nearly everything, and make just about everything tailored to taste. Good service too. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We came here for a Sunday brunch and decided to share something sweet apart to having our Benedict eggs. We wanted pancakes but then something on the menu called our attention: the O.M.G. French toasts. We decided to give it a try, admittedly a bit skeptical. We were blown away and we were constantly mumbling \"Oh My God! this is amazing\"! We had to come again the next day before leaving Phoenix back home. This time I wanted the full order for myself so I didn't  have to share it!   I would give it 5 stars because of the OMG French toasts, the Benedicts were great and tasty. The MMM mimosa was great too. The service is great and friendly. However, my only complaint was that I ordered an OJ and asked the waiter whether it was freshly squeezed OJ, he said that it was, but when I tried it, it tasted like tropicana orange juice, which is good but not what I wanted or had in mind. Other than that it is the perfect place for your breakfast and brunch cravings."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last week and the food was great but the service wasn't the best. Even though we were seated right away, it took eight minutes before a server greeted us. After ordering, there seemed to be confusion as to who's section we were in between 2 servers and host. My family and I had to repeat our order on two different occasions along with drinks. The food deserves 5 stars but due to the service I received I only gave this restaurant three stars. Hopefully the Gilbert location will be better."}
{"text":"My friend and I had just flown into Phoenix from Indianapolis by way of Cincinnati in the early morning. We had a lengthy flight and had been up for quite a while without sleep or food. While picking up our car rental from Turo, the car's owner recommended this place for some coffee and breakfast, and I'm sure glad he did. The service was spectacular, the house blend coffee was fantastic, and the food was delicious. Our server, Angela, was as polite as could be and even brought us out a free sweet potato pancake fresh from the kitchen for us to try. She made us feel very welcome from the get-go. The food was simply incredible. My friend got the Snooze Classic and I got the half-and-half order of Eggs Benedict with the Chili Verde and Steak & Eggs. Everything on my plate was fresh, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The steak was cooked a perfect medium-rare which suit the dish very well, the grilled asparagus and onions were an excellent compliment, and the pico de gallo tasted like it was picked fresh from the garden. The menu has plenty of options for every palette and the cocktail bar will satisfy anyone as well. I would definitely recommend Snooze for breakfast if you're in the Tempe area, I'd eat breakfast here every morning if I could."}
{"text":"Great meal with the customer service to match. My new favorite go to place for breakfast."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been trying to make it to Snooze for the last couple months after friends have raved about how delicious it is. We finally went this last Sunday and it didn't disappoint.   First let me say if you are looking for a quick in and out breakfast this is not your place. Expect to wait. They quoted us a 90 minute wait time. They get your cell phone number and text you when you table is ready. This works out great if you want to go next door and browse around at Nordstrom Rack. They texted us in just over an hour that our table was ready.   Service was great and the server was very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the Snooze spuds deluxe which was so delicious! We also ordered the pancake flight with a pineapple upside down pancake, a sweet potato pancake and a candied apple pancake. All were to die for!   This place is definitely worth the wait and I can't wait until the one in North Scottsdale is open in Kierland!"}
{"text":"Thanks for forgetting the pico de gallo with my take-out order and not melting the cheese. Highly disappointing."}
{"text":"Always asking my self why this place is always busy bc after all its breakfast food  Simple eggs , simple oJ . Everything is simple  After visiting this place 5 times I think it's all  The colors of this place are very warming , the service is good and smily , the food is fresh  and come fast  Overall by far the best breakfast you can ask  The best part is the atmosphere Enjoy"}
{"text":"I went to Snooze a few weeks back for brunch with a friend. Of course, I made the mistake of going on a Saturday morning so it was incredibly busy, but that was my own fault. I was told it would be a 20 minute wait but was seated in 10 - hooray! However, I do not like their \"text\" feature for alerting you when your seat is ready. At all. I much prefer the traditional method of calling out your name... Anyway, was seated and greeted by my waitress promptly, but it became apparent over the course of my visit that she was very overwhelmed. There was not an empty table the entire time I was in the restaurant. If I were a waiter there, I'd be overwhelmed too. It took quite a long time for my friend and I to get our \"specialty\" order drinks - chai tea - and it was not very good. Extremely bland and at $4 a glass, I had hoped for more. The French toast was delicious but the serving size was small for the price. My water was only refilled once and I left the restaurant very thirsty. All in all, I'd go back. I really would. But not on a weekend morning when the wait staff is too busy to refill drinks."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited around 7:00 on Labor Day. I really wanted to like Snooze.   Very nice decor and a friendly waitress, but the food let the team down.  I ordered eggs over medium with chicken sausage and an english muffin.  The eggs were over easy.  The english muffin was slightly warm, but not toasted.  I had to ask for jam. The chicken sausage was  very peppery, cayanne, maybe.  The peppery sausage taste mystified our waitress who cheerfully offer to bring me something else.  But the replacement sausage links never arrived.  The only really good thing on my plate was the hash browns which were quite nice.  She ordered the blueberry danish pancakes.  They were dry enough that she had to request syrup on the side.  One or two bites of the pancakes tasted like onions/peppers.  Something was off in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Checked in at 9:14am. 50 min later got the table. At 10:30 still waiting for food. Did not expect 2 hours to get granola with yogurt to be served which requires zero cooking...last time I visited this eatery. If you have hours to kill then please come again. If you want food in reasonable time, please check liberty market or other eateries."}
{"text":"Seriously, Snooze is the best. Food is awesome, service is friendly, atmosphere is great. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The d√©cor in this restaurant was so cute; it was very retro.  The breakfast menu was extensive making it hard to make a decision. We ended up with the breakfast burrito (very good, the green chili made it) and the homemade granola (awesome) along with 1 flight sized pineapple upside down pancake, which was the best pancake I have every had!  I also like the option to get a flight of pancakes to try all of their wonderful varieties.  The coffee was also very good and our server was very friendly and helpful.  I cannot wait to visit AZ and hit this place up again!"}
{"text":"I like Snooze. First time I tried it was in North Park in San Diego. I'm deducting 1 star because I found the OMG French Toast at this location to be more undercooked and less tasty than the one in San Diego. My advice: get here early like I did unless you want to wait outside in line for a seat. Happy eating"}
{"text":"The food was what got this place up to two stars. It was pretty tasty if you are willing to spend half your day on breakfast. This is probably the most poorly managed restaurant I have been to in years. Put your name down and go have breakfast somewhere else. By the time your name is called it should be time for lunch. After years in the industry restaurants are all about the experience and less about the food. The food was good here for the most part aside from the hash browns. For a larger sized restaurant serving breakfast food I do not understand how on earth anyone would have to wait any longer than 40 minutes, but this seems standard to Snooze. I guess if you have a half a day to spend and your bored it's a great place for people watching and you will get to eat eventually. I won't be back again."}
{"text":"i fucking love this place!!! it is a foodgasm in your mouth!! bloodies are to die for. hollandaise is sent straight from the gods  i love you guys"}
{"text":"Can you say overrated? Why people eat here will always puzzle me. I would rather go to Denny's because at least their food comes out warm and the hash browns have some flavor. Tried this place twice now and will not return."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth it! After going to snooze I was disappointed in the food. I ordered the Danish Blueberry pancakes and they were cold when served and bland. I maybe ate half of the plate and didn't even want to take the rest home. I also ordered a side of hash browns and two scrambled eggs. The hash browns had no flavor and were too soft for my liking. The eggs weren't even good. I honestly wish we had gone to IHOP instead and that is saying something."}
{"text":"I had some frittata and absolutely loved it. Boyfriend had corn beef hash and said it was also amazing. Drinks were awesome, don't get the bourbon bloody though. Yuck! We sat at the bar, and service was good.  Wish their menu was more easily readable, but the excellent food will be enough to bring us back."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Juana tacos were my favorite but I also tried two varieties of eggs Benedict which were also great."}
{"text":"Service is very good but the wait time was a lot. However, they had ping pong table so it wasn't very boring to wait. Food is good but the portions are very small."}
{"text":"The food was really yummy and the restaurant was really cute. However the bacon had a odd taste which was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Such a cool atmosphere! Reminded me of the Jetsons cartoon in some ways. Great place to share the food. I'd back off on the peanut butter on the pancake by like 75% haha soooo good. They also have gluten free options here. Great to see them on top of their game with that becoming more popular.   Service was very fun and friendly and we all know what it takes for that this early in the morning.. #appreciated haha"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast spot. The menu has such a wide variety of dishes to choose from. I had the pancake flight and it was absolutely delicious! Service was great, tasty food, fun atmosphere...what else could you possibly need? Yum! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Arizona I visit Snooze for breakfast! I come 4-5 times a year. The food is so good! The service is even better! I return and ask for Paige when I'm here. She remembers me and really makes me feel like a VIP. I love the OMG the most! Paige recommended it. I have tried nearly everything on the menu. It's all amazing, but the OMG is still number one!"}
{"text":"there coffee is amazing- food and service amazing love this place. The waitress was a little snobby and stuck up when I was trying to be friendly and talk to her but whatever"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Phoenix.  The wait is usually pretty long, but it is well worth it.  Staff is friendly and will make balloon animals while you wait.  We have had the eggs benedict, many types of pancakes, and french toast and everything has been amazing."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. I like the round tables. Very good customer service. Nice menu that has a variety of new breakfast ideas."}
{"text":"I love breakfast, but hate pancakes. Snooze has now changed my mind on pancakes because they're freaking amazing!! Sweet potato pancake & the cinnamon roll one are to die for! The portions are huge, which is nice to leave breakfast/brunch without already thinking of lunch. A new location just opened in Gilbert & I will be frequenting that location to get my fill of all these delicious breakfast offerings."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait, but it's worth it. This is far and away the best breakfast place around. Everything is good here, especially the bloody marys."}
{"text":"Been there a lot of time with my friend Michelle service has always been great we usually go on a Saturday or Sunday worth the 30 minute wait staff is friendly and helpful the managers Matt and Ramon are the best"}
{"text":"This was my second visit here, after a not so great first, and couldn't be happier. The food was absolutely delicious. I had the Ham Benedict III and my woman had the Egg omelet. We also split the pancake of the day which was a raspberry with almonds.   Karla was our waitress and was an absolute killer. She checked on us multiple times, offered input on what we should get and explained the pancake of the day in detail. Have not had a better waitress than her in a very long time!"}
{"text":"Service was superb - and sitting on the patio in a warm spring morning was nothing short of inspiring.    I ordered the Snooze Spuds Deluxe with the green chili.  Everyone at the table ordered something different - i apologize profusely I don't remember their orders - but I do remember mine - very very very (did I say Very?!) good!  Wow - great combination of flavors, perfectly cooked, spiced just right, and the right amount to fill a big boy like me without overdoing it.  Server was there just enough to take care of us and ensure drinks were filled and any needs taken care of.    I'll be back."}
{"text":"Make sure you get here early if you want a table without having to wait for at least an hour. (Although they take your number and since it's in an outdoor shopping center you can pass time by shopping).   I'm on a no caffeine and low salt diet. Unfortunately they do not have an online nutrition menu - really wish they did! However the waitress told me they could cook my hash browns without any salt which was great! Loved how crunchy it was! A little on the greasy side, but it didn't taste like it was drenched in it. I ordered a decaf iced vanilla latte, she said they only had decaf in hot but offered to put that over ice for me and it worked great! I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe however, my mimosa wasn't cold, my food wasn't warm and the pancakes were dry --- other than the pineapple upside down pancake. A little bit over priced for what you're getting."}
{"text":"If you like salmon try the Benny Goodman. It is awesome. I know this place is eco-friendly but this is Arizona - get a misting system on your patio or you are going to be sued for people and dogs dying waiting on their food.  The shade on the patio area is extreme inadequate,"}
{"text":"First time here and it was simply the best breakfast I've had in AZ .  I got the 1/2 and 1/2 Benny's with Ham Benedict III and Winter Harvest Benny. We also got the Corned Beef Hash and they even gave us a free pancake to try.. Let's just call it the world perfect pancake .. There were about 10 other things we wanted to try .. But next time .. Our server was Kate and she made us the most amazing Boss Hog Bloody mary's .. The whole staff was professional and considering it was a mid day Sunday morning, we got top notch service .. the food was hot and delicious and fast !! This takes a team effort .. This is because of a great management by Candace .. the place ran like a charm .. Thank  Rylie & Kate .. we loved it!! PS please recreate the Breakfast shot It would. be perfect for your place .. The one with OJ Butterscotch schnapps, bourbon strawberry liquor and hot bacon on top .. You could name it after me lol"}
{"text":"Always a great breakfast.  Highly recommend giving it a try. You will leave fulfilled...and maybe ready for a nap."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is rated so high?!?! I was there for Easter, we showed up about 7:45 am. The restaurant was only about 1/3 full when we arrived, so we were excited that there was no wait. We were seated at a table very quickly when we walked in. Soon after the whole experience went in the toilet! We were seated at the very end of the restaurant furthest from the front door. This was not an issue, there were several tables that had patrons as well as the tables on both side had families. We looked over the menu and waited patiently for the server. We sat for 15 minutes before I got up to find the manager. It would have not been so bad if the servers taking care of the tables around us had at least acknowledged us. When I did get to talk to the manager I completely unloaded, I ! I went back to the table, just as a server showed up. He took our order and was trying to make things better. After a little while he showed up with a special treat to make things better, it would have been great if our food had not showed up at almost the same time. Oh wait, they took our food to the table next to us and started setting it down, as the people told them they had already eaten. To finish this long post up the food was ok but it was probably made worse because of the beginning experience. I won't be recommending the place to anyone I know, especially since we never spoke to the manager after I let him have it. He never came back over to check on us."}
{"text":"2 words...raw pancake. And other words to add: slow wait, incorrect wait times, uncomfortably close seating.   The food in unique and tasty, never had an issue until my 4-5th time here (the wait to me was always worth it) when I got my pancake served raw and uncooked. :( sad to say that (as well as birds attacking us on the patio) may have been the finally verdict on us never returning."}
{"text":"We were here recently while celebrating our anniversary, and the customer service was AMAZING. Blake went above and beyond and really turned what could have been a negative experience into the opposite. We'll definitely be back   The food: Husband built his own omelet and loved it. I got the salmon plate and it was goooood and surprisingly filling! The palomimosa and Bloody Mary were  too"}
{"text":"This place is very good for breakfast but the wait time is almost unbearable. The food is good and the atmosphere is awesome just know you will probably wait a good 30-45 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"I've always heard good things about Snooze but was quite hesitant because it was still kind of pricey for breakfast. My friends and I decided to go to this location knowing the one in Tempe was going to a really long wait.  We were seated almost right away around 8:30.  I got the blueberry danish pancakes (the two full sized ones) and I definitely underestimated the sizing. I definitely have a sweet tooth and the sweetness of the toppings of the pancakes were to perfection. The pancakes were actually pretty thick and fluffy. Because of the size, i would assume that it would be slightly dry or burnt but it wasn't at all. Both pancakes were fluffy and soft. Overall, I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I always take pictures of my food but at snooze I straight up didn't have time the first time because it was so freaking delicious. I have since been at least a few times and have some more to say   I haven't seen anyone talking about their shrimp and grits but it's really good! Perfectly spicy. I'm saying that as someone from NOLA!   The hot chocolate is also delicious! Strong recommend!   The sweet potato pancake is a must! We have ordered it a la carte and it was worth the almost $5. I couldn't have 3 myself just because I can't handle that must sticky, thick sweet. The pancake itself has the perfect amount of sweet though. Sometimes we get it in the flight if we are really feeling ambitious. It goes well with the pineapple upside down!    I will say their hash browns really aren't something to call home about. It's the only part of the meal I felt we could've done without.   Service was good, prompt, kind. Seated outside which can sometimes be hazardous (they have bee problems like everywhere else in Tempe). It's a good place to take someone to Brunch if you want to seem hip."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. The atmosphere is pretty busy being next to the campus! Very lively. The only thing I didn't like is that our mimosas came  out warm so I wasn't able to drink it. The French toast was better the first time I came. I had the make your own Omelet and that was pretty tasty with jalape√±os and barbecoa! I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent eatery. Good energy and chill. Great food. Always come back to where the belly is satisfied."}
{"text":"They have some cool stuff on their menu. As a vegan, Im glad they have options like Soyrizo and Tofu Scramble. If you see these items ala carte they are a few bucks but for some reason when you order them they end up being around $10-15. Sort of strange."}
{"text":"Took my daughter to breakfast waited an hour. The service was amazing the food looked and tasted superb!! Only complaint I had was the food arrived  luke warm and I thought it should have been a little warmer.  Other than that we had a wonderful time! We will be back."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for the table.  Food was good but not worth the wait in my opinion.  Did like that they can cater to the gluten free pretty easily."}
{"text":"Had a delicious breakfast in a lovely open-air atmosphere. The service was fantastic and the manager Garrett was awesome!!"}
{"text":"My review is super late (sorry) as this was from my one and only visit last Fall.  I had a girlfriend in from out of town and decided to try this place as it was new in Gilbert.   I wish we had gone a little further down the block to a restaurant I had already dined at.      We were there on a Friday morning   We got there after what I figured was the early rush but still had to wait 15 mins to be sat despite all the open tables (we counted 5 people ahead of us at the counter waiting to be sat).  We sat outside as it appeared to be the least busy (bar was wide open and I wish we had sat there, but since she's from a cold weather town we figured let's sit outside).  The coffee was undrinkable.  I'm not sure where they get it from, but even an artificial sweeter wouldn't help improve the flavor.  Our order was pretty straight forward - nothing special or altered from the menu.  Yet we waited over 25 mins for the food.  Our server never offered an explanation as to what the delay was.  When the food finally arrived,  my friends omelette was not cooked all the way.  She didn't want to risk sending it  back as we were supposed to be on the road for a day trip to Flagstaff 15 mins. prior.  She picked the ingredients out of the omelette that she could eat and finished my toast,   I haven't been able to work up the nerve to go back and try them again.  I see the crowds of people waiting outside every Saturday morning as I head into Postino's for my breakfast.  I stick with what I know and what hasn't let me down."}
{"text":"So , just got sat down at snooze for our early Mother's Day , breakfast for the wife . The wait was a bit long , but as expected for a weekend . The staff at snooze is , well , awesome . They saw that I was a bit perturbed about something and boy did they come through and throughly make me feel better . The brought me a sinister pancake off their secret menu . Yes , they have a secret menu . And the sinister pancake is awesome ! Both my kids and wife enjoyed it , as did I . On a side note I was drink"}
{"text":"If your not in a hurry and you don't mind to wait a while for your food. This is a great place for breakfast. Minus a star because we had to wait at the door for someone to help us and there were plenty on open tables. Our food took for everyone come out. My silverware was dirty. The food was okay. I would recommend them and come again."}
{"text":"Food was subpar. Background music was so loud that I couldn't hear myself think or talk to my friends across the table. There are tons of consistently reliable breakfast places in this town. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"This place is awesome,had the best breakfast tacos I've ever had in my life, cappuccino on point, left there feeling like I just took a mini vacation! Special thanks to Lyle for incredible service, and Cameron for running such a great place! I'll definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"I couldn't decide between the blueberry pancakes and the pumpkin. The waiter suggested one of each, which I found a wonderful option....until 2 pancakes the size of my head arrived. Oh my, way too much, but delish! Oh....go with the blueberry......yum!"}
{"text":"Great social place!  Even offers vegan options.  Waitress was knowledgeable and super friendly."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here has been pretty darn amazing! Yes they have a long wait and are very busy, especially if you go on a weekend, but the food and friendliness of the staff is worth the wait to me."}
{"text":"Was pleased with the atmosphere and service. Food was outstanding. Loved the welcoming attitude on the patio towards people with dogs.  This is a place I will go back to often."}
{"text":"This place is out of this world! My wife and I visited on a weekday morning, and it was packed. Luckily there was only about a 15 minute wait. We managed to pass the time by playing ping pong on the patio. I got the pancake sampler including Sweet Potato Pancakes! It was delicious. Very comfortable setting, nice attentive staff. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"A little late on my review but this place is great for breakfast/brunch. It does get very busy so expect a wait. I ended up coming about an hour before they close and was able to get a seat at the bar straight away.   The mimosas are totally worth it. I think they were about $6 but they are big and you can tell there is enough champagne in there.   Highly recommend the eggs Benedict. I had the dui of Bella Bella benny and ham benedict III. The Bella Bella was my favorite. Definitely get the hash browns extra crispy... tastes way better.   There is so much to choose from and everything that came out of the kitchen looked delicious."}
{"text":"Our pineapple upside down cake had chocolate in it...  I think when they're busy it's a little too overwhelming and things might get confused aka extra ingredients that arnt suppose to be there... Amazing pancake still"}
{"text":"Usually quite packed in here and very noisy. All of the employees are casual and upbeat. The food comes out fairly quick, and drinks are always being refilled. The hash-browns always seem to be overly salted/seasoned making them hard to enjoy. The cinnamon roll pancakes are very good and have a little bit of crunch to them!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Snooze three times and each time I have been so impressed. Be prepared to wait as this place is popular. But once you are seated the service is excellent. With how busy they are, I am so impressed with how fast they come out with the beverages and food. The servers are super helpful and friendly. As a vegan I am grateful for their tofu scramble and soy chorizo. They know what vegan is and can make the appropriate modifications without hesitation. And did I mention the food is delicious? I also love their fun cocktails and coffee drinks."}
{"text":"Snooze is a breakfast spot for every time i visit Tempe. Amazing breakfast tacos and cute retro look. Wait staff is also very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My family's go to breakfast spot!! Seriously delicious food and a very relaxed atmosphere! But be prepared to wait-- usually a 40minute wait, even closer to lunchtime. I love the fact that they rotate the menu seasonally! Makes for awesome and delicious choices. My current favorite are the chilequilles Benedict (it has a fancier name but whatever). Instead of English muffin, the base is a delicious layer of corn tortillas and it's stuffed with barbocoa and cheese and an amazing green chili hollandaise. Sooooo good! I also love the fact they let you mix and match different types, so you can really customize to your taste bud's delight! Don't forget to do the pancake flight! The blueberry Danish pancakes are amazeballs-- not for the faint-hearted sweets hater. Also, not for diabetics. ;) Can be pricey for the overall meal, but very much well-worth it!!"}
{"text":"Worst service I ever had.  Toast wasn't even toast it was just slices of bread.  The bacon was hardly cooked and flimsy, and it was cold.  Eggs were scrambled and cold.  Very disappointed i would highly recommend Denny's over Snooze any day of the week."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. The hostess table is run AMAZINGLY!!  The issue is the service.  It just feels like everyone could use training.  I will say the blueberry pancakes are AWESOME!! They actually have blueberries in them!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for brunch and it was really good! It was a Saturday, late morning, and my first thought when walking in was, \"Call ahead of time for a reservation.\" The place was incredibly packed and they don't have a ton of room inside to wait for a table to open up, but the wait time was around 40-50 minutes at 10am. So just make a mental note of that being the number one thing to do when coming here  My second recommendation would be to not sit outside. My pregnant friend was getting rather hungry so we agreed to be seated outside. Alas, when you live in Arizona and the sun is the devil himself at times, that was not such a good idea. Normally they have misters and shade but our little spot was out of reach for both, thus naturally we were quite sweaty by the end of the meal. Not worth it. Just call ahead for an inside spot.   Overall, the food was good! We split an omelette and the O.M.G. french toast, with the french toast living up to its fame for sure. Omelette was good also, I wish they would allow more toppings though (you can pick three, the rest are about $.75 extra to $1.50). My one biggest complaint has to be how much everything is on the side. Meals themselves are decently priced, around $9-$12, but to get something like pico de gallo (just a little cup) is $.75 and orange juice for one glass was $3, so we found that to be a bit too much. Waitress and hosts were friendly, however; the store in the front is so jam packed it gave a very chaotic feel to the front of the house which is the other thing I wasn't impressed with. It took a while just for us to be on the waiting list.  So, final thoughts on Snooze: We will be returning. Mostly because the french toast was delicious. Omelette was tasty but there is only so much you can do to one, and it wasn't anything to write home about. If you are coming here get something exciting because if the rest of their pancake and waffle dishes are like the O.M.G. one, you won't be disappointed. Not bad for an Instagram restaurant!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait! Try the strawberry fields pancakes - such a unique combo. The outdoor seating is fun."}
{"text":"Coffee. Donut. Pancakes. Together in one marvelous dish. Breakfast is my favorite meal, so I have high standards, and this place met every one of them. Not only is it located in a trendy area near ASU, but the whole place is well-branded with their logo on everything. They had coffee available while you wait for a table. At 10AM on a Saturday, we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table for 3. The coffee and donut pancakes were amazing -- made with Granny Smith apples and served with a coffee cream to be used like syrup. My sister got a breakfast sandwich on a pretzel bun, which was unique and good. Their hash brown were also really good. Very friendly service! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It was 11 on a Friday; no wait.  I was seated right away even though I was still waiting for a friend- so maybe the complaints about not being seated until the whole party arrived has to do with really busy times! Fun, energetic servers... The food was delicious!  My friend had a Benedict duo and I had a breakfast burrito.  It really was a great time."}
{"text":"Went with a friend for brunch.  The food was inventive and delicious!  Many ingredients are locally sourced and nothing was just \"run of the mill\". It seems like everything has a special touch or detail. We ate so much and were beyond stuffed. Service was lovely and prompt, server was engaged and friendly. We would love to go back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Worth the wait.  Love that they text you when they are ready to seat you.  Have eaten there twice recently with friends and they all raved about it as well.  My favorite so far is an omelette with chorizo, spinach, and barbacoa.  So good."}
{"text":"I took a chance even though this was our 1st meal of 2014, but after reading all the other glowing reviews and viewing the menu I couldn't resist.  I'm soo glad because this was hands down the best breakfast we have ever had!  I'm not going to get too descriptive but instead state that in every category they score 5 out of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Wow.   Can I take this place back to Alabama with me?   Seriously though. This dining experience was well worth the 30 minute wait! The code was delicious,  the service was excellent and the food was delicious!   What we ordered: Corned Beef Hash (substituted the Candy Apple Pancake for the toast....trust me, it is worth it!)  Chilaquiles Benny  The only down side for me was that I ordered my eggs over medium and they were brought to me over easy."}
{"text":"Snooze is the real-deal breakfast spot. I'm so happy to have finally made it here, and even happier that it's so close to the Arcadia area.  The corned beef hash was amazing and definitely made in house which is an absolute \"must\". The bacon, thick cut and seasoned perfectly. I came here with my brother and he had a combination of two different eggs benedict (awesome that you can combine two different ones into a single dish) and a pineapple pancake. Every single part of the meal was fantastic.  To top it off the coffee was served hot and the service was on point with recommendations and timeliness. Definitely recommend if you can stand to wait at least 10-15 minutes even if it's not a busy weekend morning - this place gets packed quick, and for good reason!"}
{"text":"It's ok.  So many good brunch places in Phoenix. I won't be back. Long wait yet tables were always empty. Take to long to seat. My French toast was not that great. Maybe someone else will have better luck."}
{"text":"Delicious and cute retro breakfast spot! I had the Benny duo, Eggs Benedict one traditional style and the other was with lochs & capers, with hash browns & coffee. I was more than satisfied with this dish."}
{"text":"We are here for he first time last weekend and everyone in our party (6 total) were extremely pleased with our meals! We had the nicest server, and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I wish i could give 10 star.  Having brunch with my mom today.  And I just witness the most spectacular touching moment.  This gentlemen walked into the restaurant, I mean barely walked in.  He had a hard time sitting down.  One of the employees quickly walked up to him and made sure he wouldn't fall off his chair.  He ordered his meal. His meal came out, not long after this woman came up and asked if he needed help cutting his sandwich.  She cut it and he started to eat. (Our tears began rolling). This gentlemen was struggling. Before I knew it this young woman was walking up with gloves in her hand to help him eat.   Yes,  I was in major tears by now.  I offered to pay for his meal but Snooze, an A.M. Eatery told me they would take care of it.   Not only does this establishment have delicious food, but honestly even if they didn't, they just gained a faithful customer.   Every employee that crossed passed with this man was caring and showed empathy.  Most amazing act of kindness ever!"}
{"text":"My wife and I talk about going here all week. When Saturday comes we jump out of bed so we can get there early and skip the crowds. I won't bother to recommend anything because we've both had almost everything on the menu and I have yet to be disappointed. If you're into breakfast then this is a place you HAVE to try."}
{"text":"Great place with a small but tasty menu and craft cocktails for breakfast. The breakfast pot pie is awesome and so are the Chilaquiles! seating and parking (at the tempe location) are always a gamble though."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey for me personally (I'm pretty cheap) but god is it good. The Spuds deluxe is to die for but I'd recommend a half-order if you don't plan on sharing. Also highly recommend treating yourself to a mimosa. Friendly staff, good atmosphere/music. Don't really love the patio but its pretty necessary as the place is quite small."}
{"text":"Seriously?????? People don't have a clue about food. You put up a cute interior that looks like the \"Jetson's\" cartoon and they will come regardless of food and service. Wife and I arrived on a Thursday around 9:30 and they put us on a wait list and said it would be 15 minutes. They call u by texting your cell. Problem was that after 40 minutes I went in to see what was going on and the host said he texted me 10 minutes ago. Well he wrote down the wrong cell # and said \"oops, will put u back on the list\". I told him \"so for your mistake u want me to wait again?\" He realized that wasn't right so he sat us. After we sat, the waitress greeted us 5 minutes later and we ordered coffee. Which btw, the little cue card on the table says the owner searches all over Costa Rica for the right coffee beans. Hmmm, then he must have went to Folgers plant located there cause it ain't nothin special. Again, 10 minutes pass and we get to order. I had a scramble and the wife had the corned beef hash. Trying to flag down our waitress for a coffee refill was difficult as she was more concerned on how she looked in her LuLu lemon yoga pants rather than on the customers.  Food arrives.  My scramble was slopped together overcooked dry and the potatoes are put in a mold to look fancy, not!  Wife's corned beef....in edible, tasted like it was sitting out for hours & extremely sour. Waitress never bothered to ask how the meal was or thank you, just put check on table. $30 for 2 pathetic excuses for food and 1 \"mystery\" coffee. We got duped!!!!!  Be wise and take a stand, no more eating at places just cause it looks \"cool\".  Yeah.. I guess u could say I was pissed writing this review. In closing Snooze, is the correct name for it..snooze."}
{"text":"First time here, a must is the Breakfast Pot Pie my friend got that plate and it was delicious! I even wanted to trade him for my Snooze Spuds Deluxe."}
{"text":"The Ambience was casual and quaint. The food was good, rich and tasty, bold and colorful. I gave four out of five stars due to the proportion size. It was about an hour wait at 9:30 in the morning. Service was good as well as the prices  were decent"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 10, I would! This place was just phenomenal.. from the ambience.. really open and airy (if that even makes sense) it has a nice outdoor seating area and even a boche ball game for you to play.. to the friendly and fast service( despite the 30 min wait.. which let's fave it.. all good spots will have a wait) and the most important.. FOOD!  Now the food.. my god! The flavors in our meals.. were just the BOMB! I had some benedict.. with a green sauce, pico de gallo and tortillas..can't remember NAMES RIght now.. but let's just say I didn't leave one BIT behind! The mimosas were phenomenal.. not too much OJ and not too much bubbly(even tho I wouldn't have complained for that lol) overall the food was so good, that I can't wait to bring my NY friends here since were such brunchers out there lol"}
{"text":"We sat for 10 min before asking someone if we could get a drink order in. Other tables sat after us were served drinks and food before we even got our drinks. Food was decent. The cold brew coffee is horrible would not recommend that to anyone. Cool spot with a cool vibe just disappointing service."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time and loved it! We had to wait about 20 mins for a table but it went pretty fast the place was very very packed we got a nice table outside. I had eggs sausage and pancake very very good loved it all. We will for sure be going back to this place for some great breakfast and mimosas. They are also dog friendly so feel free to bring your dog!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. While a cute place (branding and decor), this restaurant should have spent a little more time and money on training their wait staff on efficiency and service. After being seated it was 15 minutes before our server greeted us and once he greeted us took our drink order & food order - that was the last time we saw him until it was time to pay the check (which came LONG after we were finished with our meal). No checking in, no refilling of beverages...bum deal.  The food - eh. Ordered the Reuben & Sweet potato pancakes. Ruben was cold, dry, and really lacked in flavor, the pretzel bun was just ....overwhelming. Pancakes were surprisingly flavorless - this was really a drag as we were so looking forward to them.   Summary: 1st and last visit complete for this place."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town. Do yourself a favor and get the sweet potato pancake. Wait time has been half as long as they told us. Great service!"}
{"text":"Fun place. Was bit of a wait to be seated but the food was very good. Another great eatery in downtown Gilbert!! Service was also very friendly. Will go back again."}
{"text":"I have been to Snooze at both the Tempe and this location, the service is very good along with the food. The only instance I had bad service the manager was nice enough to pay for the entire meal. I really love the taste of the coffee at this restaurant as well. My server the other day was Molly and she was great!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for Breakfast. Great service, delicious food, and yummy drinks. Highly recommend this location. I go here at least once a week."}
{"text":"The place is definitely a cute place to come eat, great atmosphere and friendly servers. The food wasn't exactly up to par. I was hearing a lot of rav about this and decided to check it out. The food was all that great like everyone says, I think it's just the atmosphere that made up for it. Overall this place was ok in the food department"}
{"text":"Satisfied brunch.  I tend to steer clear of chains and when a friend suggested we go, I honestly let out a sigh. The wait was long but the food was surprisingly worth the wait. I wanted a little salty and sweet combo so they let me upgrade my Benny hash browns for a piece of French toast (at an up charge). It was too much to eat at once but my cold leftovers were just as delicious. The price is reasonable and everyone in our party left very satisfied."}
{"text":"I came here today and got the Winter Harvest Benedict and it was the best I've ever had, along with the Gazpacho Bloody Mary which was extraordinary... But what I really want to point out is the service. It was on point. Olivia was my server and along with her warm and welcoming attitude, she made it a great experience. I'll definitely be coming back for all of the above. Ask for Olivia, she's amazing! :)"}
{"text":"Is I lived in Phoenix, this place would be a staple for me. I had eggs and hash and my friend had eggs Benedict. Loved them both."}
{"text":"IN THIS CASE IF YOU SNOOZE YOU DON'T LOSE!  I've been to the Snooze in San Diego a couple times and absolutely loved the place.  In that Yelp review I said I was happy that they didn't have one here in Phoenix.  Cause if they did then I would turn into a fat ass from being there so much. So when I saw they opened up a Snooze out here I had to go.  This Snooze doesn't look as good or as big as the one in San Diego. But I came here for the food and the food did not completely disappoint.  What drew me there to begin with was the pineapple upside down pancakes.  I had a pancake flight, which allows you to pick 3 different pancakes.    I got the pineapple upside down, the carrot, and sweet potato pancakes along with the Green Eggs and Hammich.  The sandwich was good, but it wasn't anything great on the same level of the pancakes.  My girlfriend had the Sandwich I am and it was pretty bland.  I ended up being a good boyfriend and switching sandwiches with her since she liked mine.  Her daughter got chocolate chip pancakes.    The reason i couldn't give this Snooze 5 stars is because of the service and the wait time.  We had to wait for about 45 minutes for a table on a Saturday morning. Now granted it was Saturday and even the Snooze in San Diego you had to wait a while for a table.  But the difference with that one was every seat was packed. And when they told you that your table was ready, your table was ready.  Here they text you to let you know that your table is ready. Then we had to wait another 5 minutes for our table to ready. The Snooze out here looked like it still had quite a bit of room to seat a good portion of people who were waiting to get tables. We sat on the patio cause it was quicker and they still had a whole other corner that could be used for seating.  For some reason they have a ping pong table taking up that whole area instead.  The other reason is the service.  Our waitress was nice but she was very neglectful, at least to our table anyway.  She brought the chocolate chip pancakes with no syrup.  she didn't come back around to ask us if we wanted anymore water, napkins, or anything else. I had to get up and grab some hot sauce from the service cart myself.  She was going around to all the other tables around us asking them if they needed anything, going over menu items with other patrons.  The 2 ladies who sat across from us had a dog with them and the dog got better service than us.  Speaking of dogs, i love dogs. If you want to bring dogs into the restaurant that's all fine and good. But to have the dog sitting at the table with you while you eat (and not a little dog either) that's a bit much.   Like i said she wasn't mean by any means, but she was not a good waitress. Will i be back at Snooze? DUH! Does a frog bump its ass when he hops?  Of course i will be there again.  The pineapple upside down pancakes are what brought me there and the pancakes are what will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Pancakes and hot chocolate are out of this world. One of my favorite breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"Snooze is a great breakfast spot. They have something for everyone and their seasonal pancakes are always on point.  They also have some of the best breakfast drinks I've found. The mimosa is solid, they make a mean greyhound and the mayan mocha will really wake you up!  Be prepared to wait for seating - this place is BUSY (but worth it)."}
{"text":"If you're craving a delicious breakfast, Snooze has you covered.  They have something for everyone  - sweet pancakes, traditional eggs and sausage, and even some spicy eggs benedict. Plus, Snooze has a full bar and they make a mean Greyhound.  Snooze is always busy, so make sure to get there before you're starving. We've had to wait just under an hour on a busy Saturday morning, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite new brunch spots! Unfortunately, it's always packed (both this location and the one in Gilbert), but that's a good thing :) Amazing food, amazing mimosas! The people at both locations are awesome, too. If you get there early, you'll be in and out. But pretty much anytime after 8am, expect a long (but well worth it) wait."}

{"text":"All breakfast-focused eateries has to be compared to Matt's Big Breakfast, and Snooze is a worthy contender.  Snooze just opened and is really popular.  We suffered through a 45 minute wait for two.   Gave them my cell phone saying they would text me when a table was ready.   This works better than the buzzer system because it give us range to explore Town & Contry Shopping Center.  I settled on the tasty Breakfast Pot Pie with a cup-shape of hash browns.  Yes, a cup   Every other hash brown I had was low and float like a pancake.  Snooze's hash brown was in the shape of a small bowl.  Whatever the shape, it was good!    Snooze is busy, slow (in service)  and loud.    Still, I like this place.   They have a number of menu items I would like to try when I return.  To get to five stars, tighten up the service (which was slow) and find a way to lighten up on the noise and we got something pretty special here."}
{"text":"I came here again with a large group of people on a Sunday morning. Our seating was a bit awkward in that staff moved a u-shaped table up to a booth so we all could be together. I'm not complaining about that as that's just how things work when a place is busy. My biggest complaint in my original review was the awful music. I upgrade this to 4 stars as the music was a bit kinder and gentler this time around."}
{"text":"Five stars for our server Kaitlyn, she was excellent. It was busy, as to be expected on a Saturday or Caturday as all the girls wear t-shirts with cats on them, but she was still super attentive. My husband and I shared Juan's Tacos and a flight of pancakes consisting of Pineapple Upside Down, Blueberry & Strawberry Shortcake.  The toppings on the pancakes were all amazing, Blueberry was my favorite. The pancakes themselves were ok, I would never order them plain, they are small and something you could make at home. The tacos came on corn tortillas, we added bacon (which was done to perfection), with eggs, pico and a tasty green chile hollandaise. We added sriracha to make them even better. My only complaint about the tacos were the giant chunks of onion in the pico, they were so large it was like I asked for extra onion.  The place is super loud as many other reviews have stated, so don't expect to have intimate conversation, and it's decor is cheesy ultra-hipster."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sat morning after hiking A mountain. Got here about 8:30am and no wait and got seated immediately. We asked to be seated outside because the weather was gorgeous after it rained the day before.  My friend ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie which was a lot of food that filled up her plate. I ordered Juans Breakfast tacos which comes in a trio. It was a little on the lighter side but my friend and I shared plates. Highly recommend the Mmm  Mmm mimosas which has OJ and Pomegranate liqueur....So good and refreshing!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast and I think Snooze does a decent job. But only when I go in. When I call ahead, 50% of the time my order is incorrect. It's small things like forgetting cheese in my scramble or my extra hollandaise, but these kind of things add up. The food is consistently good, though the hash browns are sometimes a bit undercooked. It's good, but try some other breakfast places before you make up your mind to wait an hour."}
{"text":"I had a great first visit to this breakfast eatery.  I had a cheese potato and ham breakfast.  My buddy had the corned beef hash.  We were both very happy with our meals and our coffee.   I would like to try this place out a couple more times just to make certain before I give it five stars.    As a side note, a famous former Phoenix Sun was also eating here and was kind enough to take a photo with us."}
{"text":"Very nice to site outside in a shaded area. Food and service was outstanding will come back"}
{"text":"Came here early on a Saturday morning. Sat at the bar and Ordered two coffees and breakfast. My significant others coffee was awful.  We informed the girl working behind the counter (Leia? Leigh? Lea?) that he didn't like his drink. She immediately fixed the problem and gave him samples of coffee to try to rectify the problem. Food was good, always is. The kitchen is quick and does their job correctly. Good place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I have to give 3 stars. Food was really good when you dine in. Not as good for take out. It doesn't seem to travel well. Our waitress today(monday so slow day with wait staff wrapping silverware) never came back to refill drink and I left thirsty so that wasn't great. We waited a while for the check. Rrally enjoyed the food though. French toast and my son had tomato soup and geilled cheese."}
{"text":"YES to their pancakes YES to their sandwiches. Eggs Benedict wasn't my favorite. If you're looking for some tasty breakfast you didn't have to make yourself, it perfectly hits the spot."}
{"text":"Super fun place to eat!! Great menu and great service!!! Bloody Mary with Bacon!!!!!! Yes!!!"}
{"text":"Came to eat here with my girlfriend. The service here is unmatched and the food was delicious! Definitely plan on coming back (:"}
{"text":"The art of Hollandaise is incredible! Pretty noisy but the food is worth it. The drink menu is fantastic."}
{"text":"We did not have great service so that could have made the difference but our portions were small and over priced. Drinks were really good and food was just ok. Probably should have gotten the pancakes... We won't be rushing to come back here... Interior and atmosphere was very nice"}
{"text":"Slow service, small portion, coffee unfilled. Average food.  Could not get an English muffin right. Uncooked, then burnt. Server was kind of clueless.   To charge high price they need to deliver a good experience. Failed to do so."}
{"text":"Such an awesome selection of food and always high quality. Their soy chai's are amazing! If you haven't been... You should! Your tummy will thank you."}
{"text":"Delicious and staff is unbelievably friendly! Ready for some decadent modern pancakes? This is your spot. Everything is tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Snooze Gilbert is a wonderful place to eat, with a vibrant atmosphere. From the quaint handmade coffee mugs to the life changing pancakes, this place is where you need to be for breakfast!   Suggestions :)  Try the breakfast tacos with bacon and avocado on them or sweeten things up with a cinnamon roll pancake (best thing ever)!  Between the food and the service you won't be let down!"}
{"text":"Great service and food as always was amazing the Bella Bella benny my favorite! My girlfriend got the Choco chip pancakes and her first time and she was satisfied!"}
{"text":"Have seen this place several times when visiting the area, but it has always been closed. Happens that it's only breakfast til 2ish, but I'll be making frequent visits here. Def an add to the fav breakfast spots.   Friendly staff, great ambiance, and delicious Eggs Benedict. Flavorful coffee and a nice Bloody Mary to get the Saturday started."}
{"text":"Very trendy and cute outside with games and nice outdoor seating. The service was great but food fell short... Good but not anything to rave about. We had Nutella French toast situation - I don't think there was much actual Nutella. There was some other chocolate conception over it which was not as good as Nutella would have been ....  Also tried the breakfast burrito- good flavor, kinda soggy. Nothing amazing.   Overall trendy cute place with decent food."}
{"text":"HUGE pancakes!  Amazing bloody mary's (my favorite is the Bangkok)!  You can eat healthy or indulge.  It's always packed, so come planning to be leisurely.  Service is efficient."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in town.  Their pancakes are amazing and so many unique choices.  You won't be disappointed with any of the menu items.  My favorite hash browns by far!"}
{"text":"I'm not totally getting the hype here. However, it is tasty enough and worth a visit.   The food: Everyone in my party ordered different types of eggs Benedict. I think between the three of us we tried every single flavor. They were all delicious! The salmon one... was a little weird and I would not recommend it. I felt the menu was a little misleading in that the salmon wasn't pieces but more of a salmon patty.  The hashbrowns were extremely salty but I'll write more about that below.   The drinks: YUM (and affordable!). I ordered a straight up bloody mary with an added strip of bacon for an extra $1.25. I wouldn't recommend adding that extra slice of bacon but the drink was overall tasty.   The service: The service was what made me bump this review from 3 to 4 stars. We were told the wait would be 15 mins but we were seated in less than 5. Our server (I can't remember his name..) was attentive and friendly. My server even put all of my sauces on the side because I said I had a slight dairy allergy. I complained about my hashbrowns being salty and he promptly got me a new batch of them. Deeply appreciated and no hassle! He also offered us water since it was a hot AZ summer day. Overall, the best service I've had in a long time.   Stop by and try some of the dishes! But beware... there's not much here that's dairy-free. You might have to do some improvising."}
{"text":"Snooze is a must. Let's start with the service. When we got there, the super friendly waiter/host asked if he could get us a drink while we were waiting.....since we had just ran a half marathon, we said YES. Many choices of mimosas...we have Guava Mimosas and they were delicious. Our waitress was kind, friendly and attentive. We ordered our food and didn't have to wait too long. Which was surprising considering how packed the place was. We had OMG! french toast, breakfast tacos, Huevos Rancheros, Breakfast pot pie...everything was sooooooooooo good! Then the waitress brought over the biggest pancake (for free) for us to try. It was THE BEST pancake any of us have ever had...hot, fluffy, great flavor. This place is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great post hike brunch n they are super dog friendly..amazi g food n super relaxing..great staff"}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  In addition to cranked up night club music blasting,  the food took forever, and the English muffin took 10 minutes longer to arrive after my poached egg languished on the table.  I had already left in disgust.  My companions continued their experience there,   We we all in agreement:  I would never return even if it was free.  Dismal!"}
{"text":"I meant to write this review earlier but I am just waking up from the breakfast induced coma caused by this place.  I'm going to start eating here at night as a means to address my insomnia.  Great creative menu, good execution, and some of the best benedict in town.  Just don't eat here prior to any important meetings or events."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order the cinnamon crunch pancakes. They are a hidden gem, barely mentioned in the menu but oh, so worth it. The waitress said they were the best thing in the place. She did not lie. at all. trust."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Although a franchise, Snooze is one of the best things to happen to Phoenix! The wait is never too long, and we are always seated and served accordingly. I always order the iced vanilla lattes and famous Breakfast Pot Pie! Always a great place for brunch or breakfast with friends. Mimosas are wonderful too. Highly recommend Snooze and their staff!"}
{"text":"YOU MUST GO! Diverse menu, amazing coffee and wonderful portion sizes.  My friend and I ordered the Breakfast tacos and the French toast and split them. Both were great. Also, sit on the patio if you can.  The weather + the view of the campus and its surroundings are wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  Best breakfast place we have been to in the East Valley. Not a negative thing to say and couldn't find an area needing improvement; hope they sustain this level of customer satisfaction. The menu for food and drink is varied and very flavorful. My wife had the eggs Benedict and liked the concept of mixing two choices from the selection. I had the sweet potato pancakes with a side of bacon;  incredible! The cocktails we had were flavorful and reasonably priced. We shall return many times and look forward to those visits."}
{"text":"I love the vibe here, I'm here every Tuesday with my boyfriend. Their food is amazing. I've tried all their pancakes! They're all delicious."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever. This is the only place I go to to get breakfast. I usually get the eggs Benedict, , sausage, and an omelet. Then take home the leftovers. Haha, service is always great and clean environment. Just be prepared to wait to be seated. As it's always busy because it's so good."}
{"text":"5 stars !!! The food is amazing !! Sweet potato pancake and OMG French toast is to die for . The staff is awesome, Bianca is the best !"}
{"text":"The service was absolutely terrible.  The servers were doing their checkouts while our drinks died in the well, 15 minutes for a glass of champagne, 10 for my greyhound.  The saving grace is how delicious the food is.  Our server was very friendly, but everyone else in the restaurant seemed \"checked out.\""}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Great service. Traveler to the area so didn't know what to expect. A+. Place was packed."}
{"text":"FOOD IS GREAT...TOO LOUD. I like to Relax and be able to Hear each other while eating - the trend of 'let's be hip' by having clatter, noise...and a 'frenetic feel'...I understand - Many of us mistake 'noise' for Aliveness. Did love the food, had the Benny Goodman and Bella Bella split plate breakfast...will try to find a quiet corner if possible next time...if there is one."}
{"text":"So, Dirty has been here a few times and suggest we go. Upon arrival it's a 30 minute wait and there are five open tables and no one in line... I asked what about those tables? We waited our 30 minutes and got a text message our table is ready. Out back patio seating with a nice view of the alley, perfect.   The server \"service\" at the table was Outstanding!  First up \"the coffee\"... with this nice little trifold sitting on the table with a write up about Snooze coffee you know it's got to be good right? Wrong. We thought at first it was just watery. Dirty and I requested new cup from a fresher pot. Well that did not help. We changed it up with a Americano/Espresso and Perfect.    Corned Beef Hash is SPOT ON! I could of eaten two servings.  Snooze's signature shredded hash mixed with artisan corned beef, caramelized poblanos and onions. Topped with two eggs your style & toast or tortillas. YuM!   3 Egg Omelet or Scramble nicely done with fresh spinach, perfect farm fresh eggs with a choice of three fillings served with hash browns and choice of toast or tortillas **Now available as a tofu scramble!** Tofu is really not good for you.   Our coffee was compensated, thank you very much. it only takes a moment to make a difference.  Breakfast marks the beginning of a new day. Thank you see you again soon We're sure..."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Affordable price!!! And very upbeat and happy! All the employees seem to enjoy working there! If you go, save room for a brunch desert and get the French toast it is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious all around! Celebrating my husband's bday while visiting from Chicago and this was a perfect spot for brunch! Food, drinks, service - all around wonderful. Thank you Snooze!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Service Was top notch ... And the food was well worth the visit! I would suggest the peach pancake it was worth the taking ur time to savor the taste of such a great mixture of flavors. The salted caramel latte was extremely delicious will deff go back again and again!"}
{"text":"This place is nicely decorated, layout is nice, and its not dark inside. They have a ping pong table setup outside as well. I thought that was pretty cool.   Food was flavorful! Everything we chose was surprisingly good! Presentation was also nice! I wish menus would have pictures though. I would give me an easier time to choose what i want to eat.  Servers were welcoming, helpful, and very attentive. There was so many servers so i dont think service would be a problem.   The place was alil loud, but what do you expect when its a yummy place to eat.   I gave five stars cuz i had no complaints at all."}
{"text":"Love love love the food. Big portions and great drinks. Come here with family every other Sunday and it is always amazing. The breakfast burrito is my favorite!"}
{"text":"There's a name they give their regulars and while I may not be one in Tempe I am at their location off Camelback.  I love the breakfast tacos when I added sausage and I blow through a few vanilla lattes and mmmmimosas. The service staff is the best especially when seated at the bar, you get casual and attentive service and the managers usually swing by to say hey and make sure life is good.  Check out the daily pancake because usually it's the most creative and legit inspiration to start your day."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food is perfect. Today I went with an open faced Cuban and it had the perfect pickles and pulled pork that you'd expect. My juice was fresh and my. Jody had a beermosa.   Plan on waiting because even at noon on a Wednesday there's a wait.  It's that good. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast spot in phx! Always so good! Friendly service and amazing food! The only downside is that it is always busy so it can be hard to get a table but you can normally snag bar seats if you don't mind that!  The corned beef hash is my favorite thing it's what really keeps me coming back!  And I also love to see and try their featured pancakes!"}
{"text":"We tried Snooze for the first time this morning.  I'm starting with 4 stars, but if the service and food are as good the next time, I'll upgrade to a five star rating.  We arrived at 6:40 on a Saturday, shortly after they opened.  There were already 10-12 people in the restaurant.  We were seated immediately, and had a server get our drinks as soon as we sat.  She took our food order promptly, and the food arrived about eight minutes later.    I had the corned beef hash.  The eggs were done perfectly at over-easy, and the hash was as good as the corned beef hash at Butter's in Scottsdale (the best I've had up to now.  My wife had the pretzel roll breakfast sandwich. She specifically asked for hard cooked bacon, and it was cooked exactly as she asked.   The server brought the bill as she noticed we were done, and she handled it quickly.  The total tab for two with drinks was $22.58.  This is the same as we normally spend at any other local breakfast restaurant.  There were about 30-40 people in the restaurant by 7:15 when we finished, and more were arriving steadily.  It's certainly popular.  The d√©cor is reminiscent of The Jetsons - a blend of retro sixties with a modernistic setting (circular booths in the middle of the restaurant).  There is a substantial bar focused on morning alcoholic drinks, and there is a reasonable selection of specialty drinks.    There is a small fireplace near the entrance with sofas for anyone waiting to be seated.  We added Snooze to the ranks of Biscuits, Black Bear Diner, T.C. Eggington's, and Liberty Caf√©.  We'll be back, and I'll update the rating based on future experiences."}
{"text":"Worth the Wait  It can be said that there's no shortage of breakfast eateries in the valley, however, Snooze an AM eatery stands out above the rest.  If you decide to visit Snooze you better be hungry, or plan on sharing your dish with someone else, because the portions are large and the food is delicious. This place was crowded and ee had to wait to be seated but it was worth the wait.  I highly recommend the \"pancake flight\", three pancakes of your chosing. I went with the peanut butter pancake, pineapple upside down, and sweet potato pancakes. All the pancakes were delicious but the peanut butter will knock you out. My lunch companion decided to go with the ham and eggs benedict and he said it was the best he's ever had.  Service was friendly. With no complaints from either of us, definitely looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Snooze with my wife. \"Cup of Joe\" was our server and he was amazing. If you do go to Snooze make sure you ask to sit in Joe's section! I honestly thought he was a manager the second we sat down. He came over, welcomed us and gave his recommendations since it was our first time there. Hopefully he'll become a manager soon and make Snooze an even better place to eat at.  I had their Corn Beef Hash and I was glad I did. I also had a Snooze Fashion. I am a connoisseur of Old Fashions so I figured I should try it with coffee. I'm glad I did! The longer the drink sat the better it got!  My wife had their Bella! Bella! Benny! (Mind you she doesn't like eggs Benedict AT ALL!) and she thought it was phenomenal! She also ordered a gluten free pancake which turned out to be amazing and very fluffy for being gluten free! She had some of their mimosas and really enjoyed the MMM MMM Mimosa. She said it went down really smooth. Maybe that's why she ordered more than one.  We will be returning to Snooze again, not only to sit in Joe's section, but to enjoy some more amazing food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Yea, very unlikely that I will eat here again. The wait was 45 minutes which makes one think the food is going to be freakin' fantastic but it was just normal, regular old food.  The omelette was good but not outstanding, and I tend not to trust any food that is molded into a shape like the hash browns were.  The service added to the meh. When the server came around she used condescending pet names like \"love\" and \"sweetie\", which was annoying.  In addition, I was not given any creamer for my coffee or any jam for my toast and the music is way too loud to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I ate at Snooze for the first time on Sunday, and enjoyed the experience. I love all of the little restaurants in the downtown Gilbert area, and Snooze is a great addition. The atmosphere is great, and the service is good! We went early so we were seated right away, but as we were leaving there seemed to be a little wait.   The reason I am giving 3 stars is because the breakfast burrito I ordered was VERY spicy, so much so that I did not eat much of it. The server really wanted to take it back and give  me something else, but I really do not like to do that or waste food, so I brought the rest home. There should be a warning in the menu about how spicy it is! Our server said a lot of people have been saying that recently, so hopefully they do!   I plan to come back and try it again because my Mom loved her pancakes, and I really want to try one of the morning cocktails!"}
{"text":"Yummmm, I'm in love with the lattes and both the blueberry danish pancakes & OMG, french toast are amazingly delicious, My Sister & I came across this little place in Tempe yesterday and we love it."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but every single time I have gone there has been a hair in my food. It totally ruins my appetite :/ and I feel like I've given the place a fair shot!   I say skip it and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"So it's a Monday .... I have been a snooze customer at this specific location since they opened and until today I haven't had a horrible experience. I'm not the type of person to write a review , which I suppose that's how it starts!   Today my boyfriend and I got sat as soon as we walked in the door, which is always nice .... 5 minutes goes by.... no server. 10 minutes goes by, the tables around us are being attended and yet we still don't have a server. Not once \"hey, I'll be with you in a minute!\", nothing . 15 minutes and someone walks by and asks if we have been helped , which at this point I'm beyond irritated , which it's not this persons fault but \"Alex\" who has been to tables on either side of us , is now aware we are waiting... 5 more minutes and still nothing . Needless to say, we left. As we left I let the hostess know and I felt bad for her with a this look of panic on how to handle the situation and all she could come up with was \"I'm sorry\" ."}
{"text":"The egg white omelette with three savory flavors (aka meats etc) was really delicious. The hash browns were really golden hash browns cooked to perfection. The mimosas were good too."}
{"text":"Really cool retro ski cabin feel. I dig it! Great location. They have a corn hole game on the patio, nice touch. The most decadent pancakes!!!   Now I'm vegan and unfortunately their Veg options are pretty sad. Tofu scramble consists of big plate of whisked tofu (unseasoned or sauces) and a sprinkle of cooked veggies with toast :(   Hopefully they update their menu to offer more Veg friendly options soon. Miss that place."}
{"text":"Always a good time! Tried the corned beef hash for the first time and it's very flavorful. The eggs were cooked great! The sourdough toast and jam were amazing as well. Definitely come back again. Play some ping pong while you're waiting too! Also very great atmosphere. The only downside is it's mostly busy everyday and wait will be long."}
{"text":"Food is 3.75 stars, check in people 5 stars, our waitress 2 stars. We felt good going into this restaurant and excited for their breakfast options. Wait was about 45 min Saturday morning which seems about right for a new restaurant in downtown Gilbert. The hostess party was very enthusiastic and delightful to deal with. Once we were seated the experience started to slip, our waitress was very obviously tired of working all morning and it not only showed on her face but in her attitude as well. She was short with her answers and seemed to get annoyed at any questions. Her attitude leaked into my dining experience and I was unable to enjoy my meal. Next time we come back we will try to sit in a different area."}
{"text":"If you have time and PATIENCE this place is worth it!! I'm telling you!   I come here all of the time. I've tried the breakfast tacos, hollandaise, French toast, pancakes flights.... it's all delectable and full of flavor. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Been twice good service,food,and prices will be going back. Nice sized outdoor eating areas on street side and in back."}
{"text":"Everything about Snooze is fantastic. My 10-year-old is super-picky and even he said his blueberry pancake was \"very, very delicious.\" They served fresh-squeezed apple cider with his kid's meal! My chilaquile Benedict was amazing, but even better was the fact that you can mix and match! So, I had half chilaquile and half Havana Benny- best breakfast ever! We don't eat meat, but they offer substitutes and the waitress suggested avocado with the Havana Benny- great combination! There are just so many wonderful choices on the menu- it is tough to decide! Phoenix, you are so fortunate to have a Snooze!"}
{"text":"Other than the hip decor, Snooze's service and food left TONS to be desired. I get the feeling that Snooze coasts on its great location and outdoor seating, thinking it can just mail in the rest. One of my biggest pet peeves about any restaurant...but especially one of this caliber and price point as opposed to a Waffle House or Denny's...is when an otherwise great server takes your order then hands you off to food runners who make no attempt to confirm the accuracy of orders when they're brought out, which is exactly what happened. The customer is put in the uncomfortable position of having to re-explain the order to a completely new employee oblivious to the original order, wait to eat the corrected order while everyone else digs in, and in my case eat the very dull and lack-luster final product that wasn't anywhere near worth the wait. In my case, I had breakfast tacos, featuring bland corn tortillas, barely heated and snow-white colored hash browns, and a scramble with little seasoning. It's just not what one expects of a place like this which I hold to a higher standard than Denny's or Waffle House, both of which I've eaten better (and cheaper) breakfasts at."}
{"text":"First time at snooze was phenomenal. Daniel was our server and he was extremely sweet and personable. HUGE menu with lots of variety, and our dishes were very yummy! Very cute decor and atmosphere inside the restaurant as well as a cute patio! We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Gluten free blueberry pancake might have been the best pancake I've had. Place is packed, and it is noisy. Orange juice was fresh, hash browns were really good, in a not real crispy way. The scrambled eggs were... scrambled eggs. Great place."}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place. It's always busy and after waiting awhile (45 mins) to be seated I can say I wasn't Impressed. This food is heavy comfort food. All I had was scrambled eggs and potatoes and it felt as if I was eating a plate of grease. I felt sick the rest of the day because all the grease was so unsettling. Over rated and over priced. .75 cents for a slice of toast? No thanks. I'll be spending time and money elsewhere. On a positive note the servers were kind although he admitted to forgetting about my table."}
{"text":"Trendy and popular place but not good for a weekend breakfast due to lengthy wait time. Pretty good food although my order was only lukewarm, not hot. It took  a long time to arrive. Not sure what the hold up was but judging from the melted powdered sugar, it had been sitting somewhere for a while. Spoke to the manager afterwards who made things right. Absent that, this would be a 3 star review. After all, this isn't Denny's which you will know when you see their prices ."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast DRINKS! Awesome atmosphere & service!! Pancake delish worth the wait but quicker service at the bar if open seats!!  SNOOZIUS IS LIKE A dreancicle!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. There is a wait for a reason. Server was attentive, friendly and fun. Food was incredible. I had the egg white scramble with wheat toast and hash browns. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Snooze is my new favorite breakfast place! Lots of healthy choices for every liking. Gluten free, dairy free, vegan. A little pricey, but the service and quality are awesome!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for brunch after a long night and this seemed like the perfect place.  We walked in and there was a wait but they have this cool feature in which they just text you when your table is almost ready so you can go anywhere in the shopping center. Great idea! We sat outside because it was a beautiful day and we were greeted right away by a waitress and a lady that was training with her. They were both very outgoing and friendly. We were so hungry we could not choose so she told us what we should each get and we ordered it. When we got our food it all looked amazing and we decided that we would split everything so we passed the food between all four of us and it was perfect. We had the: -Breakfast Pot Pie: absolutely delicious. Very tasty with all the flavors you need in each bite. -Snooze Breakfast Burrito: HUGE! This thing was so big that we could not even finish it! All flavors combined into a burrito... I couldn't tell you what was inside but it was all mixed beautifully -Ham Benedict III: wow I could not believe all the flavors in each bite and how perfect it was! -Pancake Flight (Pineapple Upside Down, the Carmel Apple Pie and the almond joy): now this changed my life because I love pancakes but when you make them different flavors of other desserts its just too much for me to handle but I enjoyed every bite and it was a perfect finish to the amazing feast!  We rolled out of this place very full, happy and with a lot less dollars because its not cheap but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"The staff was very helpful and pleasant.  The food was very good.  I had the pancake trio, delicious.  Wife had the breakfast bowl.  We shared; that's how we roll.  Enjoy all"}
{"text":"Great food in a fun atmosphere!  Come prepared to wait.  Coffee was excellent!  Good tea selection.  We had the breakfast pot pie and pancake flight and both were very good!"}
{"text":"If you just want a really good solid breakfast Snooze is the place.  All items are made from scratch with creative twists to american classics.  As usual with me when i pick a place you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu so i am going to give you my top 3 recommendations.  My first recommendation is the Sandwich I Am which is A soft pretzel roll filled with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and a sausage patty, served with a side of smoked cheddar hollandaise & house hash browns.  This is your high end fresh ingredient breakfast sandwich you cannot get any where else.  My second recommendation is the OMG French Toast.  This french toast is made with a Brioche stuffed with mascarpone then griddled and topped with vanilla cr√®me, salted caramel, fresh strawberries and toasted coconut. This french toast is on another level!  My last recommendation is you have to get the flight of pancakes.  You can choose any 3 pancakes and they are light, fluffy, and innovative.  Do not sleep in and hit the SNOOZE button!  Wake up and go get an amazing breakfast!  BrandonFitFoodie"}
{"text":"If you take away one thing from this review let it be: PANCAKES.  Inside the restaurant the music is extremely loud plus the abundance of chatter makes it very difficult to hear your brunch mates. Perhaps that makes me sound old, but I don't get to see these guys all the time so when I do I'd like to be able to converse with them.   Sitting outside isn't really much of an option in the summer either. There didn't appear to be much shade or misters to try to beat the heat so unless you enjoy becoming a melted burnt mess inside you go.  The service was alright, but the servers definitely seem overwhelmed with the crowd of people. We barely saw the poor thing who was busy running around. Did I mention the place was slam packed? 'Cause it was. That being said the wait time to get in was only about 20 mins.   I wasn't overly impressed with the food I ordered. My potatoes were not crisp. (I like my hash browns to have a crispy seer.) Also, there were some gross soggy pieces of bacon fat in my dish. I took the most of it home and reheated it in a skillet with some butter and that did turn out delicious.   The pancakes are where it is at though! We split a pancake flight and I have to say all 3 different kinds were fantastic! They were light and fluffy and full of flavor. They each were so good individually I don't think I could even pick one favorite of the bunch. I highly recommend trying the ones we had: Strawberry Fields, Blueberry Danish and Peanut Butter Cup. I have a feeling the rest of the pancakes and the french toast are probably equally was tasty as well.   Oh yeah, did I mention the pancakes? Get the pancakes!!"}
{"text":"BEST breakfast place ever, I will spend my last dollars on their Bella! Bella! Benny! any day. Everything is so flavorful and the staff is always so nice and in a good mood, absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"This place is good for breakfast, but it is really packed. All the time!  I was initially put off by the way I was received, the guy (host) seemed a little overwhelmed and therefore, frustrated. He was not welcoming at all and though, at the moment I didn't really feel he was friendly, I then was understandable about the fact that, the place was really busy.  After being sat down, the waitress was extremely nice, attentive and good overall. The food was amazing! I ordered the Upside Down Pineapple Pancake and it was delicious. I would definitely comeback to The Snooze to have yet, another delish breakfast."}
{"text":"Cute place. 30 minute wait, but I was solo so I sat right away at the bar.   I was drooling over the variety of sweet options on the menu. Anytime there is marscapone and caramel on bread - yes, please. I was going to order two meals and just split them but decided to do a sweet and savory (added the sweet potato pancakes) for $4. Just means I'll have to come back and try those blasted French toasts (toasti?).  Decaf coffee was yummy. The cornbeef hash was unlike any I've ever had! Definitely house made, with the surprise addition of green peppers. Usually I'm a GP skeptic (rightfully so, I think), but these were seasoned beautifully and added a depth to the hash that I really enjoyed. A side of Cholula hot sauce, and it never stood a chance. The eggs were perfectly cooked, but a little bland. Just threw some hot sauce on them and kept chewing.   That pancake ... the sweet potato in the pancake was subtle and complimented perfectly by the caramel (which I could eat on everything!) it wasn't too thick either. The meal was a reward for finishing a 5K, and I was not at all disappointed. In myself or Snooze!"}
{"text":"Excited for the opening in Ahwatukee and not disappointed! Great service, great atmosphere, great food! Server had great recommendations.  Fun experience!"}
{"text":"Good, but not great.  Perhaps a shortage of breakfast spots in the area are contributing to the hype..?  They were consistently busy from 9am to 10:30 am on a Thursday, which I found impressive... It was spring break though, so maybe that had something to do with it.  On to the food review:  I had a pancake flight and enjoyed em, but was not blown away by them.  The best part of the pancakes were the toppings.  Both the marscapone on the apple, and the caramel sauce and ginger butter on the sweet potato were uber-yummy.  The pineapple upside down and apple pancakes on their own were not impressive.  The sweet potato pancake was good on its own.  The others at my table LoVeD their hashbrowns. The portion was good and the seasonings were perfect.  The table unanimously HaTeD the bacon. To say it was crispy is an understatement.  It was about 8 seconds on the grill from being bacon dust.  By the time our server came by, we were wrapping up eating and didn't want to wait for new sides to be made though. She was nice about it and comp'd the house made chicken sausage I ordered as an apology.  The chicken sausage wasn't anything I would order again.  It was ground chicken, lightly spiced and placed on the griddle under a press ... served up flat as a board!  Not very attractive and only mildly tasty, which improved slightly with salt.  My mom had the breakfast burrito with both red and green sauce.  That was probably the winner at the table and the green sauce was darn good.  Snooze has great coffee and BIG mugs, which was nice cuz as I mentioned, service can be a bit slow w/refills and to check on you.    I'd consider returning if prompted by friends.  Not sure I'd wander that far on my own for breakfast when places like Morning Squeeze are close by and have been unanimously stellar."}
{"text":"This is a great little place in the growing down town district of Gilbert. There is an alternative vibe to the menu but definitely made the ingredients work. I was pleasantly surprised and anticipate routine visits in the future."}
{"text":"We loved the Snooze in San Diego and I'm happy to say the Tempe snooze is just as good !"}
{"text":"We stopped in this morning for breakfast to find a beautiful restaurant with friendly staff.  We were seated immediately and offered menus.    The menu is what you might expect for a breakfast place, but what caught my eye was the Ham Benedict, served with two English muffins topped with shaved hickory smoked ham, perfectly poached Niman Ranch Cage Free Eggs and smoked cheddar hollandaise.   As much as I love egg Benedict I almost hate to order it as it mostly gets served with a day old english muffins and gloopy hollandaise.  Not at Snooze, the muffin was perfectly fresh and buttery, poached egg cooked to perfection and the hollandaise was delicious.    I am Not sure what is up with the mixed reviews here, but I am sure if Snooze is not to your liking, you will always be welcomed at Denny's.  Snooze is a welcome addition to the Town and Country Shopping Center."}
{"text":"Loved this breakfast place, great staff, service and food.  I love eggs Benedict and love the multiple types available on the menu here. I had to Yelp search for this chain in Orange,  Los Angeles & San Diego counties and glad to find them in two.  One located on Tustin and the other in Hillcrest area (San Diego).  Excited to try them out locally."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  We went here on a recommendation from a friend who loved it in Colorado, and trust me people it's worth it!  Almost every Friday you can bet that we are there eating the 3 egg scramble, the breakfast burrito (the husband's fave) and whatever pancake we argue over because it's hard to pick one!  The best thing by far though is their pancakes (and this is coming from a french toast gal).  Go for the sweet potato pancake, your taste buds will thank you for it!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! First stop right off the plane and I was satisfied. I had the Mmm Mmm Mimosa, which had a flavoring of Pomegranate, and blueberry pancakes. The pancakes were huge and tasty. Even though I stuck to basics, their menu has a variety of options for both food and drink. I also loved the 60's diner setup in the dining area. We sat outside, which wasn't as fancy, but was still enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the mimosas are great also! I ordered the Benny Goodman Lox on an English muffin......delicious!!! The atmosphere is awesome. Great place to eat good food, people watch and have some cocktails. Our waitress Karlene was exceptional!! Will return when visiting AZ again."}
{"text":"Ran in quickly to get an iced coffee. Paid $3.75 for something so small and wasn't told the price only got my change back. The iced coffee was terrible. Worse coffee ever. Should've drove to Starbucks to get better coffee and service for the same price. Bleh"}
{"text":"This place has it all. Great atmosphere, food, & drinks. Service was good. We went on Valentine's Day & i loved that in the bathroom they had Valentine cards & treats just incase you forgot someone. Very excited for one going up in Gilbert. Love the Bloody Mary options. Had the Bangkok & it was spot on! Chilaquiles Benedict where amazing & I'll be honest I was very nervous about this choice. Everyone else enjoyed their meals & they were very accommodating for my friend who doesn't do dairy. Sweet potato pancakes were a pleasant surprise. Def worth the wait, especially since Postinos is next door for a Bellini while you wait."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious I will return in a heartbeat  I dined in twice the whole weekend."}
{"text":"Food is good. Mimosas are flat and the service is slow. The atmosphere is great. I would come back to try their pancakes. They looked really good. My husband had the BEAT sandwich and he loved it. I had the late harvest and it was ok. I wouldn't get that dish again. Overall I wasn't amazed with this place but I would give them a second chance."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of town and found Snooze on Yelp. From the service to the food and drinks to the atmosphere, I give this place a 5 star. They gave me a complimentary pancake so I could get a feel for the type of food they offer, with it being my first time here. It was so decadent, melt in your mouth good. I got the Sandwich I Am as my main item and it was amazing. I will definitely be coming back. Thank you Snooze and the employees for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I love the Snooze AM on Camelback.  But this one ...   I ordered the Green Tom Bloody (Bloody Mary).  They use really cheap Vodka for this drink, which costs $8.75, and it gave me a splitting headache for hours until I took some detoxing agents.  Do not get this.  On top of it, the tomato juice used taste gross like it's been on the shelf for years.  The veggies they place on top of the drink don't taste fresh at all.  Ruined my Friday morning happy mood. 1-star.  I ordered the pancake flight which was pretty good.  4-stars.  The ambiance here is nice on a Friday morning and the temperatures have dropped so that it is nice outside.  Service seemed slow.  15 minutes to get my bloody mary drink.  25 minutes to get the pancakes.  10 minute wait on Friday morning at 10:30 AM.  Nice thing about this place is that they text you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"The sweet potato pancake was a Piece of Heaven!!  The feelings that went through my mouth and body were amazing.    I ordered the pancake flight which allows you to choose 3 pancakes.  I choose blueberry danish, pineapple upside down, and sweet potato pancake.  The sweet potato pancake was my favorite.  So Yummy!!  The second favorite was the blueberry danish.  The pineapple upside down was okay.  The place is packed at 9 AM on a Thursday morning.  10-15 minute wait unless you sit at the bar.  Update 01/31/2017:  The breakfast pot pie was good but not something I would order again as there is no filling in it.  It's just gravy over flour pastry.  I thought this would be some variation of chicken pot pie but unfortunately it is nothing close.  The Havana Daydreaming Sammie was very good.  That is a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Service was subpar. Food presentation was good, but taste wasn't as good as presentation.  I had the Bella Bella Benny and all I could taste was hollandaise sauce. They also need to invest in some misters outside."}
{"text":"Wait was not long. Sunday. Great menu, breakfast cocktails!!  Got the tacos.  My food was Luke warm. Tortilla was cold. Warm eggs. Cold hash. Wasn't impressed!! Coffee was very good!! Will give it try again!!"}
{"text":"OMG... I have my new breakfast spot! The wait was definitely worth it. We got the pancake sampler I could've had that as a meal! So flavorful...  They even have alcoholic coffee drinks.  But be careful! Summer strong enough for a 4 PM happy hour drink! I love the fact that on the menu you can do a mix-and-match. I tried to different Benedict dishes and both were amazing! This is definitely a place you want to visit if you love a good breakfast spot but they do get busy fairly quickly. They are busy from open to close. But it's definitely worth it Service was stellar!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! I definitely recommend the sweet potato pancake or the chilaquiles eggs benedict! The service was great too and they were very kind."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their breakfast and coffee is so good. I really appreciate that they have coffee for those waiting to be seated as well. I haven't tried the drinks, but if hey are as good as the food and coffee, they must be great too. I highly recommend the breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Love this place, all locations are great but our fav is the one on Camelback.  Staff are literally the happiest on earth.  We of course have our favorite....Jimmy from Boston!  He is warm, welcoming and super sweet.  He treats you like family!  The food is amazing; however, I continually get the same thing: Corned beef hash, which is the most legit.  They also have an amazing Chorizo.  If you want great service with amazing food, get there early....but it is worth the wait if you sleep in!"}
{"text":"In town on business. Happened across Snooze - an AM eatery. They do breakfast right.  Had the hot chocolate. Their own brew.  Out of this world.   Then had the pancake of the day a wild southwest concoction I never dreamed would work. It was a buttermilk base pancake with bacon covered with a maple syrup infused with roasted jalepenos then drizzled with cream cheese drizzle. Unbelievable!   My server Chelsea was awesome. Great start to a great day.  The breakfast only concept reminded me of Eggs and Things inWaikiki. Why serve anything other than breakfast?  Will make it a planned destination when I return to Phoenix area"}
{"text":"Very tasty breakfast, I ordered the classic snooze breakfast it come worth 3 eggs and hash brown and 3 bacon"}
{"text":"awesome pineapple upside down pancake...can't wait to try all of their varieties - they offer a pancake flight - pick 3 - yummy eggs benny, Carla's a good server, sit w/her."}
{"text":"We've gone to Snooze a few times now & other than one visit it's been great. The manager reached out to us about that negative experience to make up for it. I really love how genuine the people working here are. They really want to make sure you leave happy & if you aren't satisfied, they want to make it right. Our server, Brendon, today was great & the food is always 5 stars"}
{"text":"This was yummy!  It was hard to decide what to get I ended up getting the breakfast pot pie, since it's not something I make at home.  It is their twist of sausage biscuits and gravy.  It didn't disappoint!  They use puff pastry for the biscuit.  Their hash browns are a little cake of potato happiness. The next time I think I would try the pancake flight...it looked yummy too.  FYI there was a wait and I think this is the norm, there are places to shop to occupy your time and they text you letting you know your table is ready."}
{"text":"The OMG french toast is phenomenal.  Prompt, friendly service."}
{"text":"So I braved coming back to Snooze (on a Friday to avoid the weekend brunch crowd) and I have to admit, I actually LOVE the food here.  What comes out of that kitchen is freaking amazing.  I haven't had anything but benedicts, pancakes, and hashbrowns and they are, no exaggeration, the best benedicts, pancakes, and hashbrowns I've ever had anywhere.  Not sure if it was the fact that I was there during the work day on Friday or if my last visit was a complete fluke but my mom and I ordered at 10:44 and got our food (two benedicts) in about 10 minutes, which was a huge improvement from the last time I went (on a Sunday), so I feel I need to upgrade my review based on that experience which was definitely 5 Stars.  Yes there is a wait for a table, because the food is really, really good.  But they are SUPER accurate with their wait times so you should know what you are getting into before putting your name on the list. Plus there's an amazing Nordstrom Rack next door so in my opinion the wait is more like a welcome invitation to shop.  They text you when your table is almost ready, and there is plenty of stuff to do in Town & Country so it goes by pretty quickly, and as long as the food comes out as quickly as it did last time, the food is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Very cute establishment. Love the 50s retro space theme + hipster waitstaff.   Went on a Sunday. Was fairly busy as we had to wait 40 mins for a table. We got a buzzer and went next door to the Nordstoms Rack to shop for a bit.   The service that day as incredibly slow. One of those \"feel like we are the table outside the servers section since we see 4 other servers but where is ours\" sort of day.   The food quality was fine by my pancakes came out cold. Was kind of a bummer.  Might come back if I was in the area or on a less busy day."}
{"text":"Delish pancakes and Michael Phelps is usually there :-) Wide variety of mimosas and bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"Oh!!!! Snooze!!! Try this place immediately. The pineapple pancake  is amazing. Great service and great people."}
{"text":"I have seen this place many times and was always curious to try it because it always seems to have a line-up on the weekends during brunch time. Now I know why. This place is strictly breakfast and lunch and they do them both well and it is BUSY. The menu is interesting and the vibe is fun. Servers wear hipster plaid and trucker hats. the menu is fun to read as it is a tad cheeky which I love, but the main reason to try Snooze is the food. Bar none, for the money, this is some of the finest brunch food in Phoenix. Their Benny's are creative, their breakfast meats have that down-home feel: real sausages, thick cut ham steak, thick bacon strips. There are plenty of veggie options as well for those not inclined to partake of salty flesh. The service has always been very good and they seem to manage their line-ups well offering toys and sidewalk chalk to keep the kids busy and free coffee for the adults waiting of tables. This is the rub and why I'm not giving this place 5 stars: the waiting. Unless you arrive super early or unless it's the middle of summer you will likely have to wait for a table. I'm not the type of person who is willing to wait very long for a table, especially for breakfast. I'm ok to lounge in the bar while waiting for a dinner table, but if all I have on board is some hot water with lemon and an espresso from home, I need to eat NOW! otherwise I end up unreasonable and Hangry. All 3 times I visited between 10am-noon I have had to wait at least 20min for a table, and once it was more like 40 and that was on a weekday. They will take your name and cel number and send you a text when your table is ready which is a nice technology-forward feature to managing wait times. Feel free to go next door and browse the racks at Nordstrom's while you wait. Also, once you do get seated, because the food is so well made and nicely presented, it takes longer to hit the table than your usual slop n' drop diner breakfast. The bottom line is is you are 3 or more in your group and it's between 10am and noon on a weekend and you guys are STARVING, I would go elsewhere. However, if you had a snack at home and are willing to put in the time, their food and service are worth the wait. The servers have the option to \"give them the pickle\" ( Anyone in the biz knows what this means. Google it.) and drop free food items on the table which can be the pancake of the day or some other delectable item to share which can stem the tide of famished glances towards the kitchen and is a nice touch. This is likely a great place to take the person you hooked up with last night for a first breakfast together, just be sure you have had a piece of fruit or something before you leave the house otherwise you may end up in a hunger-fueled tif on your first venture out together in the light of day. I usually try to take my out of town gets there for a meal when we have visitors because it is a bit of a Phoenix institution and I always enjoy the nosh! Don't hit snooze too often, get your butt outta bed and get to Snooze!!"}
{"text":"I had the Ruben, which was messy but still good. The wife had the Green Eggs and Hamwich and was worth the trip alone. Anyone who comes here needs to try it. Price was average, and service was great."}
{"text":"You snooze, you lose! My friends say this place gets packed by 830/9am so don't snooze in or you'll have to wait a long time. With that said, my friends and I arrived at 8am and didn't have to wait. The place was half full too! They have several pancake options including a new pancake of the day flavor. The pancake of the day was a pear pancake which was DELICIOUS! Their pancake is so light and fluffy and the thinly sliced pear and glaze was so perfect. I wish it was on the regular menu because I would come back just for it. Since they offer so many pancake flavors, you can order a pancake flight of 3 different pancake flavors. Yum! The salmon Benedict was okay, it's not the raw salmon but the cooked style. It was nothing to rave over but the hash that came with it was delish. Overall, order their pancakes!!"}
{"text":"Overall rating for me was closer to a 3.5.  I'd heard of Snooze in CA, but didn't get around to checking it out until I ended up near one of the AZ locations. Dropped by bright and early at 8:10 am on a Saturday morning and managed to snag one of the very last open tables outside. The line seriously starts building early so either get there super early or buckle in for a wait!   In terms of food, I wanted something savory and went with the tofu scramble (added jalapeno, caramelized onions, and pico de gallo) and my friend grabbed the breakfast pot pie and a breakfast taco. Frankly, if you are a vegan/vegetarian/omnivorous individual who loves tofu, stay away from the tofu scramble at all costs. Dear god, the tofu was lukewarm and semi-solid with all the flavor of a wet soup spoon. The caramelized onions and jalapenos added maybe .1% flavor. Initially, when my dish came out, it was missing the pico de gallo, but our server was super helpful and brought some out right away. The pico helped, but nothing could really save the tofu imo. I ended up adding a bunch of hot sauce in order to salvage the dish. The flour tortillas and the hashbrowns on the side were fine. Nothing great, but not awful either.   My friend had an amazing experience in terms of his food and ended up loving his breakfast pot pie and the taco. *I did snag a bite of the taco and I have to admit it was amazing compared to my dish.*  Service was a bit hit or miss, but our server did have a giant table he had to deal with so I can understand the flustered-ness he had about him.   Overall, this place seems to have great promise if you order literally anything else BUT the tofu scramble. I have high hopes and may visit again in the future to try the pancakes~"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. Peanut butter cup pancake,  pleasantly not overly sweet,  was very delicious. Green eggs and hamwich on cibatta was also very good. Decent coffee and espresso, too. Service is good, restaurant  is clean, ping pong on the patio. Yelpers give bad reviews because they go at peak times and have to wait, sorry that wait comes with GREAT places. Think out side the box....don't go at peak times, just get up and go."}
{"text":"Went to Snooze this morning around 1000 with my dog, Bubba. We sat outside which, in this heat, was a questionable decision but with Bubba along for the ride we didn't have a choice. We were seated on the back patio in the shade and it was actually pretty nice! Our server promptly provided a water bowl for bubba and took our orders. We both made a couple of changes to our order and the server was happy to accommodate us. I had the egg scramble with bacon and sub'd the toast for a sweet potato pancake with blueberries. Food came out quickly and was delicious. Honestly I don't know what else to say. It was a great meal with great service. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this place! I've never had a dish I didn't like. The eggs benedict is always my go to, but I will always snag a bite of my husbands pancakes because they are always amazing. My only negative would be the wait to get it, to be expected with the great food and service. Try and go when you are not on the verge of eating your right arm and you will be good."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast I've had in... ever. When we got there we saw the line was out the door and was told the wait would be about 20 minutes. We ended up waiting about 30-35 minutes and Adrian, the manager, made sure we were compensated for that by giving us 2 complimentary pancakes. Adrian was great, she wasn't our server but she was still very attentive. We were greeted and served by about  5 different very friendly people can't even remember all of the names.  The food was phenomenal. Hubby got a benne duo, one late harvest and one chilaquiles. The beef barbacoa on the chilaquiles was tender and had wonderful flavor, and the late harvest was full of delicious fall veggies and was on top of a smooth creamy grit cake. My pancake flight were the best 3 pancakes I've ever had in life. Drunkn punkn, sweet potato, and the pancake of the day was buttermilk with Bacon pieces inside topped with strawberries and nutella sauce and marscapone! So along with the pineapple upside down and blueberry danish which were complimentary, I tried 5 different flavors of deliciousness. They were all great. Bottomless cup of coffee and really good lemonade too. Nothing to complain about on the food."}
{"text":"Great food. I am not a breakfast guy at all and I enjoyed it. Menu had plenty of options. The pancakes are HUGE. Best breakfast place in Arizona."}
{"text":"Snooz is my go place for brunch with girlfriends place. They have the most delicious benedicts. Their staff are amazing as well. What else do you want?"}
{"text":"Best bf. Lots of gluten free option- just ask for options.  Pet friendly and awesome Staffs!  Very happy!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite breakfast place! I love the bacon, coffee, pancakes but mostly the environment! Heather the hostess is the sweetest girl ever! I adore her! This place as a whole I always leave with 100 percent satisfaction in knowing I was well taken care of by my server and food is always tasty! Also guys would be crazy not to promote heather into any position she desires! Great job snooze on camelback you guys are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Hello! I can say with complete sincerity that we had the best service today in Snooze; better than I have ever had in a restaurant in any small town or metropolitan area. Our server today was Sonya. She was thoughtful, helpful, and incredibly kind. The manager was very helpful to the servers and kindly made the experiences great for all of the customers around us. My boyfriend is a \"foodie\" with food blogs for multiple cities, so needless to say we eat out quite often. I was a server for over 10 years and must say that I have never seen such a great amount of teamwork, enthusiasm, hard work, and effort in ensuring the happiness of all.   Sonya made sure the seating was ok and made us feel comfortable with our dog who can be a bit jumpy with other people.  She suggested amazing items off the menu and told us about a few combinations possible that we never thought about.  Her menu guidance and advice was incredible as the food we ordered was amazing.    The great service didn't stop with her. There were other staff members who anticipated customers being too hot in the sun and moved umbrellas around without being asked. The entire experience was astounding. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Picked up breakfast with co-worker and ordered OMG French toast and corned beef hash. The food was so satisfying that I was a happy camper rest of the day I think I found my favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Three words: Are you joking?! So, so good. Menu is decent, staff is professional, knowledgable and very friendly.  The food was delectable. I am very picky and almost always send food back. I tasted everything and it was all on point.  Only suggestion is to turn the music down and switch up the play list.  Drinks were fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fun menu, great brunch location and beverages. Cons are paid parking, and there is usually a wait because food is so delicious."}
{"text":"This place is so cute. The food was unique and exciting and the atmosphere is even better. Spencer took care of us and she was amazing! She was very attentive and made sure we got all of our orders just the way we wanted them. She even sent over a gluten free pineapple pancake for me on the house! This was totally unexpected because I didn't mention my allergy but she  noticed I specified corn tortillas instead of flour. The pancake was divine and I was so appreciative of her doing that. After dining at many other breakfast locations in the Phoenix area, Snooze is by far the most exceptional in accommodating their guests and I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food is to die for . .between the unique pancakes and the incredible corned beef hash . .we will be eating there every time we are in Tempe!  Well Done!!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch, were seated and waited for 15 minutes with no drink orders nor any contact by the wait staff. We saw several standing around chatting with each other. We waived our arms and were ignored. We walked out."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Big variety & good for all...foodies & picky eaters alike. Have tried just about everything on the menu & never disappointed. Servers are pretty friendly as well. Giving 4 stars instead of 5 due to the perpetual LONG wait...and I do mean LONGGGGGGG! 1 to 2 hour wait every time! They don't take reservations, so unless you plan on arriving when they open, be prepared to wait; don't come \"hungry\" cuz you'll be starving by the time you actually get a table. I'd be more inclined to frequent this establishment if they started taking reservations...even if they did so for just 1/2 the restaurant. This scenario would be a win-win for patrons & the restaurant, in my opinion."}
{"text":"We came here a few weeks ago, mid week for breakfast.  First off, it's a restaurant, and the food was absolutely delicious.  Unique menu items and ungigantic portions.  We tried a few different benedict dishes and they even let you substitute different ones.   I am unlikely to return anytime soon though secondary to the terrible experience actually getting a table which allowed us access to said great food.  Briefly, we were told 30 minutes to wait, 45 minutes later they say 'you are next', then proceed to seat four additional parties (same size of our own).  I don't feel that I am entitled to special treatment, but please just be honest with me, otherwise you look incompetent."}
{"text":"The meatless eggs Benedict (Late Harvest Benny) is very disappointing and was probably the worst \"veggie\" eggs Benedict I've ever had. The pancake flight (pick three different pancake flavors) was pretty good, nothing amazing though. Don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time I've been to Snooze. The food overall was good. My only complaints were, the hash browns were not any good. They should really change there way of cooking cause that stacked up thing just doesn't work for hash browns. Barely brown on the top and bottom and not crispy. They should flatten them out so they are crispy. If I'm going to spend calories on hash browns they need to be good.  Also I'm not sure if you had only an hour for lunch if you could eat there. That wasn't a problem for me. Wait staff was good and friendly and the other Items we had were good."}
{"text":"Delicious Egg Benedict - and a great variety to choose from.  I suggest splitting and keep ordering until you get all you want since it is not inexpensive.   High quality ingredients, cute place.  Going right at 6 am is the ticket for me since it is extremely loud when busy."}
{"text":"Good food and even better service, if the wait is long just get a drink next door.  I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best tasting and fresh breakfast joints in town! It seems to be busy regardless of the day or time, which says a lot. I have tried the Sandwich I Am and Juans Tacos, both delicious! I suggest asking for the hash browns outside of the normal serving dish as they are cooked more :)"}
{"text":"Traveling through Tempe again and stopped here for breakfast once again. They always cook pouched eggs perfect, not to mention the sweet potato pancakes just melt in your mouth with flavor. My husband and I always share plates to taste different things. Service, also great. This ranks as one of my top favorite places for breakfast. The reason I didn't put a 5 was because they allow dogs and when they shake all their hair goes all over the place. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs, have 2 of my own."}
{"text":"I go here frequently. I always try to order something new but struggle since I've always loved my previous orders. Wish it stayed open later!"}
{"text":"We always have such a great time here! Joe is the best server - always remembers my complicated meal, my parents, and I! I ordered a burrito custom and the waitress knew exactly what on the menu was vegan! That is awesome :-) keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"45 minutes waiting time on a busy Saturday morning. Food was YUMMY! Fresh! Hash Browns. Unique flavor. Triple Berry jam. Oh my heavenly. Even my picky eater daughter loves this place! Angel was our server. Very nice lady. A perfect way to start our Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Awesome service! And the food was great! Their buttermilk pancakes were the best I've ever had. Friendly service and cool atmosphere to dine in."}
{"text":"I was excited when I found out they'd be opening a Snooze in Phoenix. They have several locations in Colorado and their breakfast is truly unparalleled in unique menu items, quality options, and healthy alternatives. Throw in the quirky/laid back atmosphere first trademarked in Denver, and you've got a recipe for a pretty kickin am eatery!!   The food I could write about--and drool over--all day. Their pancake flights are a MUST. Far too many great choices, in addition to their awesome daily specials, to decide on just one type. Among my favorites are the bananutella and the pineapple upsidedown pancakes. Don't be afraid to throw in a plain ol' buttermilk either because simple is still superb!   I have never had a server I didn't like. Apparently being welcoming, accommodating, and perfectly friendly is a hiring requirement. You know how sometimes you can just tell when employees are happy with where they work (just how you can tell when they're definitely not...)?! This is one of those places. Everyone is happy and that happiness is contagious. What an awesome place! Job well done Snooze! Thanks for moving into town!"}
{"text":"Standard brunch menu with standard tastiness. My favorite thing in their savory menu (and I've tried a lot in attempt to like this place my friends love) is the create-your-own omelettes. Their hash browns don't have much flavor. The restaurant is cute but I think people just love this place because there aren't that many brunch places in Phoenix. Their best item is they have a pancake that they inserted icing into it, it's tasty."}
{"text":"Breakfast perfection.   I usually hate places that don't take reservations but since this was breakfast I managed to pull myself out of bed early. Be prepared there will be a wait. We got there at 8 and we waited for 10 mins which was bearable.   The best breakfast I've ever had. Stepdaughter said it was the best pancake she's ever had. We had the pancake flight (chocolate chip, pineapple upside down, cinnamon roll), chile verde Benny, breakfast tacos, ham Benedict and a sausage and egg sandwich. All the pancakes were to die for!!!!  I never finish my food but I devoured my chile verde Benny.   It couldn't have been a more perfect meal. It was seriously worth the drive. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place to go in Arizona!! food is always spectacular. Service is typical average nothing to special there but the food is well worth every second you spend there!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best home cooked breakfast, just like grandma made! Cozy upbeat environment filled with happy people. I tried the up apple down side pine cake and it's to die for."}
{"text":"It is always busy, don't arrive starving. Bar is first come. Food is great, love their renditions of Eggs Benedict, I also enjoyed their light Frittata. We went everyday when we were in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazing food my oldest daughter said her mouth was in heaven. The food is fantastic try the breakfast sandwiches you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great improvement from our last visit here. We were arrayed promptly and served just as quick. I had Juan's Breakfast Tacos and they were very good."}
{"text":"OMG... Fantastic breakfast and experience.  First time here and our server Vinny and Steven were AMAZING!  Recommendations were spot on and we ended up ordering some really amazing breakfast plates.    Although the breakfast pot pie and the breakfast burrito are their most popular, my favorite was the Juevos Ranceros with pulled pork on corn tortillas and the Traditional and Winter Harvest Eggs Benedict.     If you love pancakes then you have to try the upside down pineapple pancake.  It lives up to its name and taste like heaven!  You definitely have to try breakfast here at Snooze!"}
{"text":"Snooze will definitely become a regular for me. I can't believe I've waited so long to give it a try! Off the bat I appreciate the bright and fresh atmosphere of the 21st & Camelback location- a large open room with warm lighting and wall to wall windows. The menu was packed with traditional breakfast and brunch goodies with an obvious flair for fine dining. I sat at the bar and try server was sure to set me up with water and coffee and great drink menu. I will have to return to try one of their cocktails, they look fun and satisfying! My server explained Snooze is known for their Benedicts but I was like a moth to a flame to the Sandwich I Am, a meal fit for any hungry tummy. Sandwich I Am is a breakfast sandwich, a large quality pork sausage patty topped with fluffy 2 fluffy  eggs and cheddar cheese all in top of a soft, warm pretzel bun.... I'm salivating even as I write this and I've already eaten it! Through and through it was a great experience. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and the brunch is fabulous....but the host staff are kinda jerks! We came this morning for a planned celebratory brunch for five. Three of is arrived 25 minutes early to account for the wait that we knew we would have. When it was time for us to be sat, the host would not seat the three of us until our entire party arrived-even when we explained that the other two in our party were minutes away because it was \"policy\". We were clearly upset by this as we had planned for the long wait that is expected here accordingly, but were upset as we were left standing in the lobby. I expressed how upsetting this was and suggested they post the \"policy\" so that it is clear and not just a surprise after a 30 minute wait."}
{"text":"We were very curious to try Snooze for the first time as we've always seen a line driving by...now we see what all the fuss is about! It's super cute, the staff was very friendly and the food was delicious! Seriously delicious, and I'm not a huge breakfast fan.   My boyfriend got the breakfast pot pie, which was yummy. I couldn't decide between two items so I asked our lovely waitress, Bambi, what she recommended. Low and behold, you can do half orders and do a combo (what!), so I got the Bella! Bella! Benny and the OMG! French Toast. Both were delicious, and it was perfect having a savory dish and a sweet dish.   As we were enjoying our meal, the manager brought over a massive white chocolate chip pancake topped with some goodness and nuts and butter, as a \"thank you\" from our waitress. It was scrumptious, but even if it hadn't have been, how nice was that?!?! It was the cherry on top of a delightful meal. We will DEFINITELY be back, yay for finding our new favorite breakfast place!!!"}
{"text":"Snooze is an alright breakfast place. The pancakes are definitely the highlight. But they're still small. I always leave feeling hungry. I've tried the sausage Benny, really small portions as well. Snooze has a fun atmosphere and great employees but the food is disappointing. It's right on ASU's campus so many college students can come here. If you're in the mood for sweet pancakes, it's a good place. Any other type of home cooked breakfast food is a no."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim.  Excellent food and service.  Was surprised about a 25 min. Wait on a Monday am but totally worth it.   They have complimentary coffee so I was happy while waiting .   Tried the Bella Bella Benedict. Omg... Flavors will not be forgotten. I'm so sad I will have to wait for our next trip here.  So much more to try. Everything looked delicious!"}
{"text":"I love a good breakfast and double points for having a great environment including the music (i.e. Snow Patrol, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Metric) playing.  I had the Sam I am Sandwich on the pretzel bread (don't want to think about the calories) that comes with a spicy hollandaise- D-lish!  the soy latte was really great as well  will definitely be frequenting this place"}
{"text":"Breakfast restaurants are a natural place to start the day.  This one has vibrant colors and a modern decor.  We decided to sit on the patio since the music was loud and my friend couldn't hear with that much background sound.  The full bar provided a ginger beer and vodka drink that was delicious.  Heaters for chilly days are available but today it was not needed given the warm day. Our brunch was sweet potato pancakes with caramel sauce and walnuts and an eggs benedict over palenta with hash browns.  They arrived a bit late as did the coffee, but the wait and a good stiff drink made the extra time fly by. Ingredients are fresh and flavors are excellent, this food is exceptional. Snooze has plenty of young people and a very kind and efficient staff that keeps pace with a constant steady business in the middle of the day. The location is perfect with a high-end grocery store and a bulk store around the back of the mall.  After the meal you can walk around the renovated mall and shop to your heart's content."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. We sat at the bar and didn't have to wait the quoted 45 min wait for a table. Bartenders we're super friendly. Had the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and it was phenomenal!! Also tried out the mimosas and bloody mary's. Will definitely recommend and be back!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, typical American fare nothing super exciting. Not a full bar and grouchy waitress"}
{"text":"Be prepared for a wait! But it's worth it and there is plenty of room to wait comfortably and the bathrooms are centrally located for easy access which was nice. The location is great and the ambiance and decor was great. Our server was noticeably overwhelmed and our service time was a bit long but we were visiting with friends so we're not rushing, don't come here in a hurry. The food was really good, and fresh tasting. There was a good variety. The pancakes were delicious, rich, but delicious. Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"Loved my breakfast tacos and my chika enjoyed her eggs Benedict. Some of the seating is right on top of people, felt like I couldn't really have a private conversation and it was a bit pricey. The food tho was great, would go back."}
{"text":"My entire family came here on a wet sunday morning an loved every part of it, the ambiance was great, the food over the top great and sevice was top nitch"}
{"text":"Waited a good fifteen minutes to be acknowledged and offered coffee. Not a good start  over medium eggs were over light. I did not eat, nor complain, however I think attentive server should have noticed.  Pineapple upside down pancake was superb.  Tacos could of had more chorizo overall not bad.   Cool interior.  Servers friendly but a bit aloof"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic we went early morning when they opened up so it's not that busy but customer service was awesome very good atmosphere best breakfast place I've eaten in a long time and I currently live out of state! Corned beef hash and pineapple upside down pancake highly recommended"}
{"text":"Waited happily for about an hour for a table with friends who could not say enough wonderful things about Snooze. We were seated outside at a beautiful table, and as we walked to the table we were assured that although the there was no umbrella over the table currently, they would be moving one to alleviate the Phoenix sun.   After our waitress took our drink order, we were basically told we were moving inside due to not being able to move an umbrella. SHANNON was very rude in her delivery of the news and never apologized or recognized the error in their lack of hospitality. The new waitress more than made up for the rudeness of SHANNON and our meal was delicious. However, the incident in moving our party of 5 hung over our meal.   Another authoritative member of the staff did bring a complimentary plate of pancakes that we were not terribly interested in having since 4 out of 5 of our party had already ordered pancakes. Again, still without apology.   Restaurants are not solely about food, but experience. SHANNON could use some training in her understanding of a full dining experience."}
{"text":"So I've stood in line for an hour before to eat at the Denver location of Snooze. I was so excited to learn that they were coming to Phoenix (and appear to be planning on opening another location in the Valley as well). Finally got to go today and was not disappointed!  As others have mentioned, you can get half orders of meals in order to try a couple different things. I think that's pretty amazing in itself. Their pancakes are creative and incredible. Today's pancake of the day was white chocolate cherry and oh my lord, it was sensational. If you order food that isn't pancakes, you can also order a small pancake of your choice to have on the side so as to sample it without ordering a huge one.  The staff was genuine and appreciative of our business. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to answer every question we had. She had informed the manager that we had been to the Denver location and the manager came over to welcome us and chat a bit. We felt like VIP's during our very first trip to this location!  I honestly can't recommend this place enough. I missed it so much after moving back from Denver and I can honestly say that I'll be a regular at Snooze. I'm going to bring as many people as I can too. Everyone should experience this place."}
{"text":"I waited a good long time to come into snooze (worried about the hungry hoards that have been eagerly awaiting their opening), turns out I had nothing to worry about.  They are located in Town and Country right next to the LA fitness (so you can work off the pancakes I guess).  The coffee is good and served in comfortable large mugs.  Omlettes and savory dishes feature prominently and I haven't ventured into the sweet side of things (yet) as they veered a little into the candy side for me.  I love the d√©cor, very comfortable mid centuryish modern.  Service was chipper, almost a little too chipper for a grouch like me in the morning.  For less chipper minded headed over to Daily Dose across the street, but if you don't mind happy come on over!"}
{"text":"A great place to grab a good bite of breakfast.. definitely a nice morning date spot, but so far all the times I've gone it's been so packed that the wait time is about an hour. Must mean that it's THAT good."}
{"text":"Everything here is complex and so good! They specialize in egg benedicts, breakfast sandwiches, and pancakes.  Had a lox benedict that was so good, and they use cream cheese in their hollandaise sauce. So creamy. Pancakes from pineapple upside-down to donut- inspired. We left wanting to go back the next time we visited phoenix. Get there early! On a week-day it got busy around 830 :)"}
{"text":"Just left Snooze (Gilbert) after a brunch with the fam. Whether your looking for a family breakfast/brunch/lunch or trying to cure a hangover, Snooze aces it. The portions always satisfy, but aren't so big that they weigh you down. Breakfast tacos with Bacon hit the spot today. All menu items I have had in the past are flavorful and well prepared. The Peanut Butter Cup Pancake is insane, counting calories aside. Stuck with coffee today, but next time I need to continue to work my way through the AM cocktail menu. Always a good idea to hit Snooze."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. My aunt and I were here during the Mama's Makers Market on May 12. We had tried to eat here before but the wait time was always long. We got lucky and were able to sit outside rather quickly. The service is amazing, the atmosphere was great! I got the Ham Benedict and my aunt got the Frittata. Both were served in a timely manner despite them being busy, and the food was phenomenal. My eggs Benedict was amazing and my aunt said her Frittata was great! I will definitely be back to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The menu is mouthwatering, decisions are not easily made.  I've been here twice and the food just wasn't good at all.  One time, the hash browns were under  cooked and still hard.  The other time, the food was cold, like literally cold, there's no way it was prepared for me.  My michelada was delicious and the service was okay but not enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Snooze AZ, and the food is just as I remembered from San Diego.  Like the other reviews have said, the wait, even during the week, gets crazy. We went on a Wednesday at 10am and there was a 45 minute wait... BUT, being the hottest day of the year so far (114) , the patio had no wait. They turned on the misters and with a cup of water, it wasn't bad at all.   I got the pancake flight, $8, with two Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes and one Flavor of the day. I DREAM about the Pineapple Pancakes. The hash browns are well seasoned, $2, and the kids meal comes with a lot for only $6 (Fruit, eggs, toast, hash browns, juice).  Everything about this place makes me want to come back... every week!"}
{"text":"I love this breakfast place! If your in town come try their pancake flight. I'm a big fan of their blue berry danish, pineapple upside down, and their sweet potato pancakes, it is really worth the calories. Since I don't eat red meat anymore, I order from their light menu which is the egg whites and greens, very good and lots of veggies!  This place is good for big groups but man if you are really starving and can't wait about 20-45 minutes in line, then go somewhere else, but again you have to try their pancakes! They can get really packed in the morning and it doesn't matter what day of the week they are just always busy. I think for two people we paid 30 dollars."}
{"text":"first time at snooze.  This location is near downtown Tempe/mill. If you come here on the weekend, apparently the Parking Garage next door is free. Good thing to know if you're looking for a parking spot.  Pretty nice area and location. We had a group of 10, divide the group into 5 and 5 for seating, as It was a faster waiting time. It did take at least 50 minutes to an hour of waiting, and this was around 12pm.   Luckily we were seated into booth next to each other, even though it was back-to-back. Server and waitress were all friendly and pretty attentive.  For food, I had the snooze breakfast burrito. The burrito had hash brown, beans, eggs, and I decided to add in the chicken meat, which cost additional $1 or something I believe. Everything was topped off with tomatoes and their green chili sauce. What I didn't like about the burrito, was there was way too much hash brown in the burrito, which does fill you up, but I wish there was something else inside the burrito. Definitely wanted more chicken in the burrito, but maybe a few bites had a little bit more chicken.  Burrito overall was just okay, nothing special. Also the burrito was a little dry. I had to use their table green chili sauce for additional sauciness. And ketchup for the hash brown, wish I dissected it out.   But if you're hungry, the burrito will feel you up for sure. I only finished just a little over half of the burrito.  Pricing was around $13.   They do have inside and outside restroom.  Also when you are waiting, there is a person on the patio making mimosa and drinks for you while you wait. which is a nice touch. There is also a ping pong table outside.  --- I was able to try one of their pancakes as well. Not sure what type of pancake it was. But the pancake had a cinnamon / some caramel / mostly butterscotch syrup on the pancake. With a brown sugar butter cream on top. The pancake was actually pretty delicious. Would probably recommend having their sweet or pancakes, as opposed to the burrito for sure.   Also it is ridiculous that a single pancake cost $4.75.   Would I come back to snooze? If there wasn't a wait, maybe. But I will probably check out other breakfast/brunch places first before coming back to snooze. Their pancake was good though."}
{"text":"Food is good there. Wait is ridiculous, I guess that happens when you are new  and popular. This location is ideal for those who want to feel safe and sheltered. Parking  was a pain. Service was pleasant but our food was cold to the touch, management more than made up by getting out more food pronto. So biggest issues was long wait and cold food but ...once  everything was corrected then very good brunch."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Great food, service & drinks! Went with my vegetarian friend and we split a pancake flight (pb cup, chocolate chip and danish blueberry which was the fav) and a burrito with soyrizo + the mmm mosa and dirty drunk chai. Went on a Friday morning so only had a 10 min wait, recommend a week day if you can swing it!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place even for lunch!   The breakfast pot pie is delicious.  Order an extra egg, the one is just not enough for all the goodness on the plate"}
{"text":"Very good food, love the selection, I hate the wait but can't really help it. Good environment, fun."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend after an uber driver recommended the place and said it was a must. He sure was right! The \"Pancake Flight\" was the best decision we got the pineapple upside down pancake, sweet potatoes pancake and the Hot Cocoa pancake. They were out of this world amazing! We had gone Saturday for brunch and we loved it so much we went again on Sunday but the line was too long and we had a flight to catch back home. It is definitely worth the wait! On Saturday we only had to wait only ten minutes and we ended up popping into some shops near by while we waited to be called for a table. Also their hash browns and coffee are delicious! I wish I lived in AZ for this amazing spot!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious (had the Benny Duo) and service was attentive but it was unbearably loud inside. I actually opted to sit outside. For brunch. In Arizona. IN AUGUST."}
{"text":"Such a cool retro little place. The French toast was amazing. Had a little issue with the hash browns though, mother in law found herself eating a bunch plastic, but the waitress took a couple of dollars off the bill. Definitely recommend the French toast over the pancakes; best thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"The coffee is really amazing here!  Went on a Saturday and was seated within 10 minutes of my arrival. Had the French toast and it was good. Definitely will return. Only complaint is the acoustics of the space, it was really difficult to carry on a conversation because of the noise level."}
{"text":"Yum! Just eat here! Pancake flight (OMG French Toast, Pineapple pancake are top choices!) and chicken sausage: delish. Great service. Outside dining."}
{"text":"Long wait but will be worth it. There is a ping pong table table here. Patio and inside are chill."}
{"text":"The spicy bloody Marys are highly recommended. We were a group of 10 and even though we came on a crowded Saturday afternoon the crew was able to host us in 15 mins.    The food was great. Lot of veggie options ( if you can eat eggs). The drinks were well mixed. We had to wait a little for our food, but the staff was very friendly. Considering we were 10 people the wait time was warranted.   Highly recommend the place. Especially for groups."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a healthy breakfast spot, this is the place.  Food was amazing, portions were very large and the service was great.    If you get there before 9 on the weekend, there is no waiting either.  This place has only been open for a short time but you can't tell my the line of folks waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Seated right away early about 11am on a Wednesday. Food came out quick. Server was ok but we kinda felt rushed to leave as we were slowing down on our food. Cute place, delicious latte. I was expecting the food to be amazing as I read here on Yelp but I was a little let down. I ordered the Chilaquiles Benedict, the beef very tasty but everything else a little bland. The fianc√© had the corn beef hash and it was a little burnt and have had better in local diners. All in all I think I'd come back just to give this place another chance and to try some other things on menu."}
{"text":"Snooze sure doesn't make me snooze (and the bad jokes continue). I'll happily wake up earlier to beat the rush at Snooze for brunch, especially for their sweet potato pancakes and corned beef hash. What I love most about Snooze is their no hassle half-order policy; customers can pretty much request half orders on anything without worrying about ridiculously higher price points or messed up orders.   I love salty and sweet combinations, but I can rarely have the best of both worlds unless I dine out with a friend (and they're willing to share). Not so at Snooze! My favorite combination thus far is a half-order of corned beef hash and a half order of pancakes (one huge pancake). Oh did I mention Snooze's pancakes are the only ones I've ever liked? I'm usually a religious French toast follower, but the pancakes here are the perfect balance between fluffy and cakey. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the syrup, which I find really sweet and on the watery side, but I feel like the pancakes don't even need the syrup so it's not a big deal to me.  Service is always friendly and super laid back. Sometimes it takes a little bit of flagging during peak hours, but it's always greeted with a smile.   I haven't had a bad dish at Snooze, and some of my favorites are:  Pancakes pancakes pancakes: Snooze has a specialty pancake on rotation, and I've tried three different kinds so far and liked them all. Specials will be written at the front on a little blackboard, can be ordered within pancake flights, or can be ordered with a half order. Full orders are two huge pancakes, half order is one, and flights are three smaller-sized pancakes. So far my favorites have been chocolate chip, sweet potato, and a specialty one served with chocolate, almonds, and homemade creme anglaise. I've also enjoyed their plain, blueberry danish, and other specialty pancakes. The texture is really nice on these pancakes -- not too cakey, just be right amount of fluffy.  French toast: There are two kinds of french toast: neat and OMG. I think they're rather similar, with the OMG coming with more mascarpone cheese stuffed in the middle while the neat version has a little dollop on top. I find the neat to be more balanced and less heavy, especially when topped with fresh fruit that have thus far been strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries.   Corned beef hash: Seriously scrumptious corned beef hash with tender and flavorful corned beef, cohesive hash browns, and lovely flavoring. I substitute the toast out for more hash browns and mix it in. You can also ask for the hash browns to be extra crispy, although I like the original soft ones just fine.  Breakfast pie: I was curious as to what this actually was, and it turned out to be a flaky puff pastry doused in gravy with eggs and hash browns. The puff pastry was stellar, especially speaking as an amateur baker who has fumbled many times at making puff pastry. It was light and airy, with a  perfect crunch on the edges and a buttery flakiness in the middle. The gravy didn't mask the texture of the pastry, and it complemented the overall dish well. I was surprised by how much I liked this dish, and I'd order it again on a cheat day.  Benedicts: Snooze offers an interesting quinoa benedict with corn salsa. I thought the taste and textures were well thought out, but it took a little getting used to. The sharpness of the spice and creaminess of the egg and sauce complemented each other well. Regular eggs benedict was good as well, and eggs were poached perfectly each time.  Miscellaneous items: I've had a mocha here a couple of times, and it wasn't bad, but I'd probably opt for the plain coffee.  Hot chocolate comes with cinnamon and a heaping mound of whipped cream. Chicken sausage can be request a la carte, and I appreciate the non-red meat option. Extra crispy hash browns are smooshed down into flattened discs instead of the regular cupped kind and fried until they're crunchy on the outside.  Writing this review makes me hungry for Snooze, and chances are I'll be back this week."}
{"text":"Snooze did not live up to the hype. It's one of those places people tend to put up on a pedestal so expectations were high, and well, we left feeling underwhelmed. First, the wait was pretty long. In fairness, it was a holiday, but from what I understand, it's sort of the norm here anyway. The look of the place is clean and hip, and the staff were nice, but the food was nowhere close to what we were hoping for.   My breakfast burrito, an item we were told is their most popular dish, was big, but so dry I couldn't finish it. My wife wasn't crazy about her eggs benedict or her Bloody Mary either. My cappuccino was okay, though nothing special. There was a slight mixup with the drinks, that we had to get corrected, the server was apologetic, and maybe the holiday rush added to the confusion. At the end of it all, we looked at eachother and asked, \"Did you think it was as good as you thought it would be?\" The answer was pretty obvious without having to say it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've waited this long to try out Snooze!  It was incredible.  At a recent yelp elite event I sampled their French toast and I don't even really like French toast and it was amazing.  Today however I tried the steak and eggs benny and it was amazing!  The poblano grits were so good, the steak was perfectly cooked and the hollandaise sauce was offthe hook amazingly delicious.  My husband ordered the danish blueberry pancakes and they were so rich and delicious.  He really had to dig deep to finish his serving, but he did.  Though he may be regretting it all day.  But it was really that good.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Snooze for years now I can't believe I haven't written a review yet! This location is convenient to my house and apparently also for a lot of other people because there is always a wait! I have had a few things from their menu including the Snooze Continental {house made granola | Greek yogurt | Agave nectar drizzle | Grapefruit brul√©e | choice of toast} which I think is the perfect light but filling breakfast. I have also had the Benny Goodman {Eggs Benedict with Lox style salmon and cream cheese} which is to die for! Seriously I was skeptical of salmon with Hollandaise sauce but it is fantastic! My most recent visit I shared the Blueberry Danish Pancakes and the Quinoa Breakfast Bowl. Holy smokes guys, the pancakes were perfect! A perfect balance of sweetness from the blueberry coulis, sweet cream and almond streusel with a lemon cream cheese filling. The quinoa bowl was equally as satisfying (and a bit easier on the waist!) with heirloom carrots, baby kale, crispy prosciutto, and a poached egg. You can choose how the egg is cooked but I'm partial to poached. Service here is always good in my experience. It might not be the best place to take the parents as they can play music pretty loud but that doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by Snooze. So many breakfast places in the Valley are, for lack of a better work, underwhelming. I don't need a lumberjack slam or an eight page menu of just breakfast offerings. Just do what you do and do it well - and that describes our experiences at Snooze. Excellent service, good coffee (BIG CUPS - if you are reading this, Snooze, we always have to ask for extra creamer for our two coffees), and good food. The interior is cool and comfortable. I'm glad we tried the place and, if you are considering giving Snooze a go, I think you will too."}
{"text":"Quick Summary: We went on a Sunday Morning during a busy time and expected to wait. They seated us within the predicted time frame and promptly took our orders. The ambiance is welcoming and bright with large open windows that nicely blend the outdoors with the indoors. The servers were friendly and the food was great. I've listed some pros and cons below. Overall we were very satisfied.   Pros: *Ambiance - Cool retro Jetsons  -like theme.   *Could get coffee and specialty drinks from the bar while waiting to be seated. *Gluten free pancakes for adults and kids and the kids plates were completely polished off because they loved them so much.  *Excellent fluffy and tasty pancakes.  *3rd Street Chai (aka their Honey Vanilla sweet chai) was really good...so good my wife ordered a second one.  *Orange juice was fresh and delicious.  *Pineapple upside down pancake was great.  *Balloon animals for the kids on this Sunday morning made smiles and gave us something for the kids to take home.  *Friendly servers.   Cons: *Music in restaurant a little too loud for normal conversation and made it hard to hear the server.  *Table Turn Times slow. Many tables were empty for up to 5 minutes waiting to be bussed after a party left. Of course, when you're starving, even a few minutes seems like forever.  *Not enough sauce initially on my Strawberry Rhubarb pancakes.  *The strawberry rhubarb pancake only came with a blended sauce and no real strawberries.   Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in tempe. Our waiter brought us an order of sinful pancakes and they are still my favorite pancakes of all time. Ate them so fast I couldn't get a picture in time"}
{"text":"Server was Charles he was very pleasant, polite and attentive to my wife and I. We had the Oreo pancakes and breakfast burrito. I must say I was skeptical of the pancakes but they were good."}
{"text":"Located next to the Fulton center Parking, they serve solid breakfast here. Came here after the race day 2 during RNR AZ marathon as I parked at the Fulton parking in the morning. Walking back from Tempe park, I wanted to stop for breakfast sooner but I didn't have money with me, I had to go back to my car first to get my credit card. Conveniently located next to where I parked, this restaurant was perfect as I didn't have to walk anymore.  Initially I was told 20 mins wait, but they have some seats available with bar height chairs, I was told they were first come first served. Shortly after I sat down, friendly server came to take an order. She was extremely busy but her service was prompt.   Food is excellent. We had pinnacle upside down pancake and ham Benedict, both tasted very good, solid breakfast.  Porched egg was cooked perfect, good sauce, I also enjoyed their hash browns. Good textures.  Good portion size, definitely hit the spot after running.  Parking was free for runners when I arrived at 6:30am but notice they charge $5 for special event when I came back. Not sure how much is parking normally.  I always thought Tempe is just a college town and never ventured out here but now I know, I would like to explore this area more."}
{"text":"Snooze is my favorite breakfast spot.  The food is not your traditional breakfast recipes.  Everything is made with a flare which is just delicious.   It's so hard to decide what to order each time because it is all so good.  I only wish they offered a sample plate so you can have a little of everything.  They actually offer the eggs Benedict that way singly can order two different types.  I recommend the Chile Verde Benedict and the Bella Bella but if your a potato lover the Snooze spuds are awesome either the pulled pork and jalape√±os.  Never a bad meal here."}
{"text":"It's been a while since my last trip to snooze and glad to be back. Can't wait for my Bella Bella Benedict to arrive.  If you've never tried snooze you need to get here.  Long waits on weekends but well worth it. I've never had a bad meal here.  Try the spuds if your really hungry.  Nice job Snooze."}
{"text":"Still giving this place five stars.   Went for breakfast/lunch the other day.   I had the coupon for a free cinnamon roll pancake from when they were at Best of the Biltmore (or was that the Best of New Times??)  Oh, well, one of those best events.   My daughter had the B.E.A.T. sandwich.  Rachel was our server.  We sat outside cause why not with today's weather.   I had ordered a couple of egga to offset the pancake.   The pancake was light and fluffy and the sauce on top was oh so sweet.   Almost too sweet.   The eggs helped cut down on how sweet I thought it was although I did save the rest for later that day, and it didn't seem so bad.   Still light and fluffy, though.     My daughter's sandwich was an acronym for bacon, egg, avocado and tomato.   I ate half of that later as well as the side of hash browns.  She skipped the avocado.     Lots of thick cut bacon, which I love.  Even though I ate it as a leftover, the bread was not soggy, and the condiments were quite tasty.   Of course, the bacon is what really added to it since it was essentially a bacon sandwich by that time.  I still vote the blueberry danish pancake as the best so far at this place.   Whenever I think of eating at Snooze, that's what I want to order."}
{"text":"Snooze is my favorite breakfast spot in the valley.  The staff is great and it is totally kid friendly.  Its a good balance between classic breakfast and healthier options.  The menu is really big and has a good variety of options.  It can get busy, but while you wait they have some games and activities for kids.  Prices are reasonable and the kids menu is a great deal.  One of my favorites for sure!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed!! The wait was 35min we waited they seated us outside on the higher chair the most uncomfortable chairs ever!!! then waited for over 15min for our drinks and the cold brew was garbage do not order!!!!! Then waited over 15min just to order. I got the early harvest benny it was really really good if review was just on food it would get 5 starts but overall not impressed."}
{"text":"Well I finally had a chance to try out Snooze Eatery and really enjoyed the grub.  I say that even though we had to wait an hour for a seat. The family stopped by on Sunday morning and as mentioned, the place was very busy. No big deal, the wife and daughter drained the pocket book at other retail shops while we waited :). The restaurant had a nice vibe to it. Our waiter was very outgoing and helpful. For the food, we tried the trio of pancakes (pineapple, peach, and potato) and a benedict plate (sadly forgot the name). All were super tasty and if sweet is your thing, the pancakes are the way to go. Again though, both dishes were oh so good. I will definitely come by again and just hope its sooner than later."}
{"text":"Nice modern and clean place, that was great for brunch. Convenient with them texting you when the table is ready. We ordered the Benedict, corn beef hash and the cinnamon roll pancake. The eggs benedict and cinnamon pancakes were delicious! The corn beef hash was alright, barely any hash browns. Overall experience was great though."}
{"text":"Great food.  I hate this whole hipster crap but this place is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm... so good! You can't go wrong with Snooze. I love their eggs benedicts -- all of them are absolutely delicious. My friend recommended the chilaquiles one, and she had the great insight to substitute the corn tortilla with English muffins. Yes, it makes it less authentic, but corn tortilla just don't soak up that deliciously runny egg as well as English muffins do. It is absolutely heavenly!  My very first time at Snooze as at the Gilbert location, and that day, all of our orders were incredibly salty. I've also had some rather curt servers there. However, the staff (servers and chefs) here at the Tempe location know what they are doing. The food came out better than I expected and the servers were friendly. Although we waited an hour to be seated (this was a Saturday morning at 10 am), it was definitely worth it. Next time I am feeling in the mood for brunch at Snooze, I will pick this location over the Gilbert one."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about Snooze for brunch, so I came with some friends to try it out. We came right at the rush, and the place was packed. Luckily the first person who arrived already put down a table, so we waited probably 20-30 minutes at most. While you wait, help yourself to coffee, which is off to the right when you walk in. I thought it was a very nice note of hospitality to customers.  We got seated to a nice comfy booth, but since we were catching up with each other, it took us a while to make our orders. Nonetheless, the server was patient with us. Some friends who had visited before said that the eggs Benedict were good, so I went with the Ham Benedict. It was definitely true to legend, and I ate it all up! The eggs were the perfect level of runny, and the English muffin sopped it up nicely. The only thing that was a little off was the hash browns were a bit salty, and that was the general opinion around the table, but we are all looking forward to brunch here again!"}
{"text":"A lot of hoopla from my Denver friends so I had to check it out. High hopes ends in disappointment.   First issue, unorganized front desk. Seating people out of check-in order (same size party) makes for a frustrating experience. Four tables sitting empty for nearly 10 minutes with people waiting  (that never makes sense to me). From what I could tell, the front desk nedeed \"one\" person to take control. In a nutshell, too many employees standing around staring at the iPads.  After a 25 minute wait (we were advised 10-15) we make it to the table and I ordered a glass of cranberry juice. Whatever you do, don't order it! When it arrived in a tall glass it was nearly clear with a hint of pink. I knew at that very moment we had a problem. I took a sip and as I expected it was watered down and barely resembled cranberry. Why would you serve this? I then ordered the Bella Bella which was quite good. I would definetly recommend it.   So would I visit again? No"}
{"text":"Crazy good!   Now we are crazy full!   Our server Britt was very helpful, responsive and a delightful person.  We had green eggs and hamwich, breakfast burrito,  sammy I am, and flight of pancakes.   Place has a cool vibe and a good pace of service.   Great meal and experience.   Would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for the first time the other day, and the food was awesome! I got the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup, and a cinnamon pancake (random, I know), and she got the OMG French toast. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because there was stuff floating in my water, and there still was even after they replaced my drink. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The pancakes were terrible. They have a strange taste to them and the portion sizes are not very large. There are better breakfast places near by that are well worth your money. Go to them instead."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to breakfast here today. I know they're packed on the weekend, but during the week it's almost empty first thing in the morning.   I had the OMG French toast. It was dessert for breakfast: French toast with mascarpone, caramel sauce, and strawberries. My dining partner had the breakfast pot pie - it looked delicious.   Our coffee cups were always full. Our server was attentive but not overbearing.  I may not be back on the weekend because of how busy it gets, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"I frequent Snooze Town and Country once a week since they opened. The service has always been great until today. Food took over 40 minutes and the waitress Shelly disappeared the entire time not even filling our teas. I finally found her and asked why the entire patio received their food except me and I was there first. She checked in the back and told me they were out of poached eggs and it would be another 3-5 minutes. The food came out finally and it was delicious however we never saw Shelly again. I hope she splits tips with Charles because be picked up her slack big time. She finally dropped the bill and we asked for a refill which we never got. I decided to let the manager know so other guests dont have our experience and her response is \"she is trying and Snooze is a beast of a restaurant\". I guess maybe Shelly learned from the manager. I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in their lack of customer service and dishonesty here. Im from Los Angeles and was visiting some friends this weekend in Phoenix. We had a 3pm flight to catch so we got to the restaurant at 1030am. We assumed from the number of yelp reviews that it was popular and would have a wait so we were pleasantly surprised when they told us 15-20 mins. 30 mins later when we asked about our table they said there were 3 tables in front of us and it should be another 15-20 mins. I specifically asked asked are you sure, you don't think it's going to be longer? And they said no, about 15-20 mins. Another 45 mins later we were told there were 6 tables in front of us and it should be 15-30 mins. At that point we didn't want to risk it and just found another spot to eat. An hour and a half from when we put our name down we got a text that our table would be ready soon. An hour and a half!  I completely understand long waits, especially for good food and trendy restaurants. What I don't understand is giving false wait times to your guest. If we were told an hour to an hour and a half wait at the beginning we would have realized we couldnt wait that long and just left, no harm. But to give your guests unrealistic wait times is not good customer service. In addition, I don't understand how it jumped from 3 tables to 6 tables ahead of us. It was suppose to be on a first come first serve basis so I hope we weren't discriminated against for having 2 children with us.  I was very excited to try this place but will never come back here and our friends who live in Phoenix will spread that word too."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed with this place - menu seemed so awesome, I thought they might have a shot at dethroning Butter's as my breakfast favorite in Phoenix.  Alas, it wasn't to be.  The benny we had was good but not great, and the pancake flight underwhelmed.  Pineapple upside down pancake was watery and the sweet potato pancake didn't have any sweet potato taste at all.  And my lord the ginger butter was way over the top.  Also, their hash browns look pretty but are a pile of mush.  Boo...  Place seemed trendy and most folks were sipping mimosas and bloody Mary's.  Maybe that's our mistake, this one's for hair of the dog not great eats."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Hawaii for the GCU winter graduation. We googled places nearby to where we were staying and chose Snooze. At first we were worried about the wait time but when we got there we arrived right before the crowd and only waited 15 minutes. Our server was friendly and we also said hello to another server  (Jenna) originally from Hawaii. The food was great. The Benny Duo Benedict, Snooze Classic a d Corn Beef Hash were all winner selections.  I loved the atmosphere!  Great breakfast/brunch selections"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Someone recommend I come here for breakfast and I'm glad I did! Beautiful atmosphere, customer service was excellent, and the food was to DIE FOR! It doesn't get better than this! Please give this place a try; you won't be sorry you did, and you'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"You tell them you are here, they text you when they can seat you, and they give you free coffee to keep you awake while you wait!  Then, it gets even BETTER!  The food is innovative and delicious.  I love breakfast, but there is usually one thing on the plate that could be prepared a bit better. Not here.  Our food came out hot and perfect.  I had the breakfast pot pie - puff pastry covered with a mild sausage gravy and a perfect over-easy egg.  Puff pastry crunchy and flaky?  Check.  Sausage gravy smooth and just the right thickness?  Check.  Egg cooked just over and hot?  Check.  Then, to top it all off, a round mold of the most delicious, perfectly crisped hash browns ever!    My husband had the breakfast burrito.  Not original, you say?  Think again.  Fluffy, creamy eggs, with onions, chorizo and hash browns in a soft, soft, soft (not mushy, soft) burrito with a salsa verde on top.  I do not like chorizo or onions, but on this burrito, it was a perfect combination.  I wanted to eat slowly so I would never finish this meal.  The menu is so innovative and everything looks and sounds delicious.  We watched people rave to one another about the sweet potato pancakes and the Bella=Bella Benny.  The wait is more than worth it - but if you hate to wait, come early.  You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went back for our second visit. We arrived just after 11am on  Friday, 7/24/2015. I would have sworn it was Mothers Day Sunday, it was crazy busy. We were told a 20 minute wait, it was longer. Once again, the music is so loud, along with the people noise, it's just to loud. We finally get a table, a half booth with a bench and a funky, uncomfortable plastic chair, Our server was so nice, but I had to have him repeat what he said a few times due to the noise.   My wife ordered the \"Breakfast Pot Pie Snooze's homemade rosemary sausage gravy smothers a flaky puff pastry, topped with an egg your style (we'd say sunny side up!). You've reached breakfast bliss, complete with hash browns. $9.00. She was not impressed. No Bliss reached here. How can you call a puff pastry, that has nothing on the inside, but has gravy over the top a \"Pot Pie\"? I had a bite, and I too, thought it was plain.  I had the \"Snooze Breakfast Burrito Burrito Filled with scrambled eggs, hash browns, house black beans, cheddar & jack cheese, topped with pico de gallo and choice of green chili or ranchero  (psst, love your veggies & meats)\"  I added pulled pork. It is rather large, topped in green sauce. I cut it open down the middle, and I could see the shredded cheese, it had not melted. This is a giant pet peeve of mine. The inside had spots that were warmer then others, but the cheese not melted, still looking like it just came out of a bag, not good. I ate some of the giant tortilla, but then just the insides.  I did not finish, lost my appetite, my wife didn't want a bite. Its not vey appetizing to look at. I think they need to put this in a very hot oven, to really get it HOT inside. I didn't tell our server, we had waited long enough.   We shared the \"Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes Buttermilk pancakes with caramelized pineapple chunks, housemade vanilla cr√®me anglaise and cinnamon butter\". This was the best part of our breakfast. The pineapple chunks were warm, no way were the caramelized. $7.50 for two pancakes. Very sweet, gooey, Good!.  After trying Snooze for a second time, I have lowered my rating to \"2 Stars\".  The loud music, loud chatter noise, long wait turned me way off. { I don't mind a long wait if the end result is satisfaction} If the food was Great, then maybe, maybe, I would over look the other things, but with this much going against it, we won't be back.   I now , along with my wife, give Snooze a big \"DOH!\""}
{"text":"Snooze is so good. Very high quality ingredients and presentation. A wide variety of choices and gluten free options!!! A long wait sometimes especially on weekends but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"They have the most amazing upside down pineapple pancakes ever!. I go to this place for brunch at least once a week because the taste is just incredible and I can't complain about anything."}
{"text":"We love snooze! It's a great place to bring friends and family! They have a great menu with a wide variety for all! The only downside is that they have a massive wait time, all the time. I would likely recommend implementing some sort of app reservation/checkin service. Erika helped us today and even brought us a complimentary pancake, super awesome service!"}
{"text":"It's a solid breakfast spot that offers better variety than some of the other places around."}
{"text":"Went to Snooze this morning for a work meeting. This was my third visit and, as usual, the food was amazing! But what really made this visit phenomenal was our servers, Vincent and Katie. Both of them went above and beyond, from Vincent bringing me a sweet potato pancake (which was to die for) to try while I was waiting for my colleague to join, to Katie giving us to go cups at the end of our visit, I can't think of a thing that could have been better. I stopped on my way out to talk to the manager and thank her for having such amazing people. This visit made my week! I definitely recommend Snooze and the Gilbert staff!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts in town. The corn beef hash is to die for. The service was spot on, great toast, great coffee, even has great swag. Not one to miss!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes as we tried the blueberry Danish pancakes and the banana french toast!  Not to mention best service from Lolita!!"}
{"text":"It's worth the 30 minute wait!  Breakfast burrito was awesome. People were hip and not stuck up. Mimosas to die for. I'd suggest this place to anyone. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"even though it is nice to have a new eatery in the neighborhood...and we wish them good luck..they need to work on the food.. nice waitress but she was even embarrassed....took forever for order to arrive and not all in party were served at the same time...food was tasteless...hashbrowns just bronw on outside..raw on inside..other foods cheese was burned...sandwich tasteless..not sure what ingredients the chef used in that ruben but it was a gagger...  waitress tried to resolve with chef but no relief was offered...businesses are built on return customers and referrals..but I don't see us returning there or making positive referrals..sorry  UPDATE: Others in the party contacted the restaurant. The management/owners? contacted her . They were very receptive to the comments and critique and our concerns and wanted to make it right. People in our party will try the new place again (ON THE HOUSE) and hope that event was just a fluke. Hope the new restaurant continues to try and improve service and food."}
{"text":"Chilaquiles- 8/10 Breakfast pie - 7/10 Sweet potato pancakes- 9/10 Burrito - 7/10 (it's hugeee) Men's bathroom 8/10 (small, but clean.. Also they have a baby changer, soooo get to it dads!) Women's bathroom-  (I couldn't get it, I'm man) Overall great place."}
{"text":"I can't stop thinking about my amazing breakfast!!  This was our second time at Snooze. Though I felt the service was just ok our first visit, it was incredible this time around. There seemed to be a super long wait (10:30am on a Sunday), but when I went to put my name on the list, I was given the option to sit immediately at the breakfast bar, the best of inside and outside; a seat in the restaurant,  fully open to the patio and street traffic. A nice spot for just the two of us, maybe not ideal for larger groups.   Our server, Kaitlyn, was awesome - super friendly and helpful. I had the spicy Bloody Mary to start. One of the best parts of the menu is the ample vegetarian offering. This time I had the Snooze Spuds Deluxe with Soyrizo and Poblano Peppers mixed in, scrambled egg added on top. Heaven! Between this and the bloody, my hangover was cured. Unfortunately, I'm plagued with an obsession over this food and can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite place! Fantastic food , tons of options but I do love the breakfast burritos! Such a great energy there and awesome staff . We also love it because we can enjoy our weekend with our four legged children"}
{"text":"Service could have been better. They did not refill our waters and never asked if we wanted another coffee or drink. Food was ok menu was very plain. Not worth the wait that they normally have. Daily dose was a shorter wait and better menu."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!  I am so happy to find a breakfast place worth raving about.  In a sea on boring breakfast options, my sister introduced me to this gem.  I don't care if the wait is always 45 minutes.  I'll wait.  It's worth it.  I talked about their chorizo breakfast tacos to anyone that would listen for weeks.  The porridge is amazing, sweet potato pancakes delicious.... I have yet to find something not unbelievable on the menu.    If you're looking for breakfast, go here.  Do some shopping while you wait, then come enjoy the deliciousness while you are sitting out on their patio area enjoying the sunshine."}
{"text":"First impression: girl who greeted and sat us looked like she just rolled out of bed and hadn't brushed her hair for a few days. Floor under our table was dirty.   Some food was good; some was just ok. Enjoyed the BLT type sandwich but hash browns were lacking."}
{"text":"I had never eaten here before, however, when I heard my friend had a job here, I decided to stop by. I ordered eggs Benedict and added cooked spinach, and OH MY LORD... I have never seen eggs cooked quite so perfectly... The dish was creamy and absolutely delicious. I recommend swapping out the side of hash browns with the pesto tomatoes. My waitress Gloria was not only quick, but also chatty, kind, and funny! Ask for her next time you go!"}
{"text":"It was our first time since this restaurant closes at 2:30pm every day & we are not morning people. This was a graduation celebration & it was recommended by a friend. Overall, I was not happy with the small portions for the amount of money we spent or the inattentive waitstaff. My daughter & I always split our meals because neither of us eat very much but here she was just barely full & I only had 1/4th of her french toast, so I would guesstimate that the portions are half the size of almost every other breakfast restaurant we have been to.  Once we realized how small her portion was I was prepared to order another meal but the waiter never came by to ask us how our food was or how we were doing until everyone was almost done eating & it was too late to order something else."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast place. Everything is cooked PERFECTLY. I had the make your own omelette and the hashbrowns are like a big hashbrowns cake - cooked perfectly. The eggs are so silky and tasty.   We got our food quickly too. We shared an order of the pineapple upside down pancake- great choice. So tasty and no syrup needed. Every bite was savory. Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"I've brunched at Snooze a handful of times, and ranked it 4 stars...up until my last visit. We had been waiting for almost an hour for a table (you can expect this if you come any time before 11:30 a.m. on a weekend), and when we were seated, the manager comped us a \"pancake flight\" with three full-size Snooze specialty pancakes - just as a thank you for waiting! My group inhaled them faster than I could snap a picture, but they were incredible. Service is always great here - you can tell that the servers and hosts really enjoy their jobs, and it's a fun and quirky place to be!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place ever! The food is sooooo good, you have to try the hash."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and seeing the long lines I was ready to enjoy a really good breakfast boy was I disappointed   I ordered something call the potato mix it came with cheese, scallions and 2 choices so I had spinach which there was 4 pieces of it then I added chicken sausage  which wa tough and no flavor oh and it had 2 eggs on top, I bought it would come with toast and boy was I wrong so I added an order of toast and received 1 piece! What ever happened to 2 slices of toast? Well back to the potatoes they had just been shed or frozen and barely warmed on the grill I was so hungry  after the wait to be seated and he wait time for the food I just ate what I could. When the waiter brought the bill he saw that I couldn't eat my potatoes and let him know that they were undercooked and he said maybe next time they would be better and walked away.  I couldn't believe it!! Don't worry I won't be back!!! The place is loud, and not close to being worth the wait! Save your time and money"}
{"text":"Pretty long wait on weekends but the food and service are amazing every time and there are so many options."}
{"text":"If you want an incredibly sweet and savory breakfast, this is the place to go!!! My boyfriend and I shared the OMG French Toast and after the first bite, I said OMG this is SO good! We also shared the Sandwich I Am, which was a sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich on top of a pretzel bun. The servers were very nice and made sure our order was correct when we received our food. It was conveniently located right by ASU sports facilities, which we visited afterwards."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely obsessed with Snooze and cannot wait for their Gilbert location to open! The d√©cor reminds me of retro modern and the servers here are fun with great personalities! My party decided to order and share so I was able to try multiple things on the menu. Their flight of pancakes is a great deal- we got the pear, pineapple and blueberry streusel. All of them are great but the pear was my favorite! The brioche French toast is outstanding as well. The benedicts are great too because you can order both the same or 2 different ones. I went with the ham and chilaquiles and I loved the chilaquiles one! Hash browns are also great!   I really don't have a negative thing to say about this place. As a tip, they do get very busy so call ahead or be OK with a wait.  Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"It was good. The ambiance here is very similar to the Camelback location. Just more of a different crowd (of course being in a college town). Business crowd at lunch time. Service and work ethic is at every snooze location is to be expected the same at every location.   Food, solid (as usual, stays consistent from each location). Food came rather quickly. Very nice surprise.   Cheers to the staff and their smiley faces!"}
{"text":"So this time was one of the worst times since me and my girlfriend has been here. Katy (tall light black skinned lady) was really unattentive (from getting back to us about what to order) to the food taking a very long time to come out (mind you we've been here 2 other times, busier, and have gotten our food faster than this.)   This time they failed us.  BUT Echo saved the day. She came to our table and sat down, talked to all of us, even took care of our whole bill. I will give this place 4 stars because of that right there. Professionalism. Thanks Echo.  Definitely for those of you reading this review, if you haven't tried this place, come and try it out!"}
{"text":"Went at open and smelled like food was being prepped :) Ordered peanut butter pancakes and they were Gluten free also. They 2 pancakes like a big plate size , could only finish 1 and half . Bud got pot pie, the hash brown was moist and creamy ."}
{"text":"What a cute place!  The atmosphere outside was relaxing, and the outdoor heaters warmed up a slightly chilly morning.  The food was very good, and there were some really original dishes on the menu.  The staff was very nice and as attentive as they could be on such a busy morning.  The whole restaurant was very clean and trendy. Very family friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, fun environment. I love this place and their breakfast pot pie is great!  Totally recommend this place, it has quickly  become a favorite!"}
{"text":"Service was good until it came time to close out, another server came by and made it seem like it was unreasonable to ask for my tab before paying, which really soured the experience. I get being busy before close but when 5 of you are clustered just chilling and talking while we wait on a check it's a problem. The host was really good, very engaging on our way to the table."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Snooze in Gilbert for breakfast. I had the pumpkin pancakes and my husband had French toast. Both were delicious. The service was great, too. They have a good menu and a full bar as well as some specialty drinks."}
{"text":"Love!  But do NOT take any staff recommendations. Go with what you like.  I'd been suggested items twice & they were not great.  The Benedict's & Bloody's are bomb"}
{"text":"Don't snooze on Snooze. it is DELICIOUS! I get a half order of the OMG French toast and a half order of the breakfast tacos and by the end of it, my plates are bare. the sauce in the tacos is just magical. and the syrup mixed with the cream cheese or WHATEVER IT IS, that's on the French toast just melts me. I really enjoy snooze. (and the tacos are vegetarian. PLUS!)"}
{"text":"These out-of-towners from L.A. lved our meals! The wait was torturous (because of hunger) but worth the wait! If this is what the locals wait up to an hour, then it must be good right?!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service and constantly messes up my order through the to go service. I've had my to go order messed up at least 7 times now. I've probably only ordered there 10 times in all. My boss loves the food so I continue to pick up food from them but I am constantly trying to fix errors with them. My boss's card was overcharged today and then after making a phone call about the incorrect order and incorrect charge, they told me I should be thankful for the extra food. This is so infuriating as it wasn't \"extra\" food. It was the wrong order and a waste of food."}
{"text":"The pancakes are outrageous, however if you are looking more for savory than sweet you might have a more difficult time finding something to eat.  It is a fun place to eat, crazy busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"I'm visiting for graduation weekend and we headed to this place for a late Sunday brunch. We were quoted a 35 minutes wait but it was actually closer to 20 which was great for us. Our waitress was a little spacey and kept forgetting to pick up my friends Chai from the bar but over then that we had no issues. I ordered a Snooze Double Stack that I stuffed with sausage and onions and my companions had OMG French Toast, and the Ham Benedict and it was all delicious and I felt well priced"}
{"text":"When it come to their food I would definitely say 5 stars but when it comes to service I would say 2 stars. I'm in town visiting a friend and came to have breakfast here. I was super excited to have breakfast and mimosas and when they asked for my ID the waitress made a big deal because i'm from California and I don't have an Arizona ID. She went to ask a manager which I thought was ridiculous as I'm over 21 and comes over and says they will let it slide but it's not allowed due to them not wanting to lose their license and like I said IM OVER 21!? So apparently you have to be from Arizona to drink in Arizona? After that I felt very uncomfortable as she was just talking to my friend and would barely even look my way even to ask me my order. I ordered the Chile Verde Benedict but I have never had eggs Benedict so I asked it the egg was runny and she said,\"Girl have you never had an eggs Benedict because of course it's runny!\" It made me feel even worse so I just asked for it over hard. I will say it was the best thing I have tried. But If I ever come back I would definitely get my food to go!"}
{"text":"I find this restaurant overrated and overhyped. They have cute decor and a nice patio but I think the atmosphere is better than the actual food. The mimosas were good, hard to screw that up, but our server was pretty aloof and  my sister had to literally flag him down to let him know he forgot to order hers. My dish was good not great, and my sisters (marscapone?) pancakes were way too sweet and rich.  I think there are way better brunch places in Tempe and you won't have to deal with paying for parking (they don't validate) or long waits."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, drinks are made with love and service pretty chill friendly. For Drinks i had mayan mocha."}
{"text":"I had my first experience with Snooze when I was in Denver last year so was thrilled to see that there were several in the Phoenix area on a recent trip!   And, seeing as how I won't get my fix until my next trip out west in May, I made the most of it with a pancake flight (blueberry Danish, pineapple upside down cake and molten chocolate lava).  Seriously the best gluten free pancakes EVER and the pineapple upside down was hands down the favorite.  Also, I love that they have gluten free toast for the benedicts, and that you can mix and match.  I got the Bella Benny and one with lox.  Perfectly seasoned everything, and my only regret is again, that there isn't one in my hometown.  If you don't have a Snooze near you, you owe it to yourself to make a trip when you find one near!"}
{"text":"Ok, you Phoenix locals, quit hogging the good dining spots.  Snooze AM is the kind of diner that I wish we had back in my hometown. Solid food, some nice surprises and a edgy decor.  We visited on a Monday morning for breakfast and were greeted by an almost full restaurant. Finding a spot at the bar we were quickly welcomed by a friendly staff and provided good coffee and a selection of tea.  The menu has some standards, but we were recommended to try their special focus - Benedict.  I thoroughly enjoyed my blend of two different dishes  - one was a barbacoa and the other was a mushroom and asparagus. Outstanding.  Important to note is that they are willing to accept special requests. Need a half sized portion? No problem. Want to try a split dish? Do it. Have an original idea for a dish? Bring it on.  They are also a brunch place with great options for adult beverages, including Bloody Marys, Beer and Wine on Tap.  So, do yourself a favor, bust in on the locals hiding place and enjoy some great food and a cool dining experience."}
{"text":"Go EARLY and avoid the wait to be seated. We sat at the bar to avoid waiting for a table. I had the pancake flight (one was the French toast) with a side of bacon. Everything was favorable down to the thick cut bacon. The Mister had egg white omelette with veggies, hash brown and toast. He enjoyed his food as well. The atmosphere is what you would expect in a college area...casual, hip and busy. Wasn't too thrilled with having to watch  the Nickelodeon channel at the bar while drinking our mimosas. Would have preferred sports highlights or national news."}
{"text":"The only down side is you can almost always expect to wait about an hour to eat here, but the food is great. Get a pancake for the table to share - it's a must!"}
{"text":"I am always up for a good breakfast place and Snooze AM Eatery is no exception.  They've been open for about three weeks now, and they are definitely doing something right.  Luckily, when I went by with a colleague on Friday morning, we just missed the rush; there was only a few minute wait to get seated at around 9:30am.  The name \"Snooze,\" may conjure up the image of someone sleeping in, but the staff at this place is high energy and full of smiles.  The hostess, server, and all of the staff we encountered were super friendly.  The atmosphere is bright and cheery -- clean too.  Our coffee and water were constantly being refilled and our food arrived pretty quickly after we ordered as well.  I had an omelette with egg whites, spinach, mushroom and jack cheese with tomatoes and multi-grain toast.  I know, I know... boring but healthy and made just right.  I was a happy camper.  My dining companion had the Upstream Benny.  We also shared a side of the signature \"Sweet Potato Pancake.\"  Mmmmmmmm - I highly recommend it!    I don't know that I'd go wait in line to eat at Snooze on the weekend, but I totally recommend it as a weekday option.  I noticed they have plenty of bar seating - a nice option for anyone that may be dining solo.  Seeing that this is their 9th location (they've got several in Colorado and California), I have a feeling this place will do just fine and I look forward to returning sometime soon!"}
{"text":"We had been to the Snooze in Fort Collins, CO and loved it. We were looking for breakfast nearby and saw Snooze and decided to give it a try. The over easy eggs I ordered were cooked perfectly. The flight of pancakes were great. Service was great and we were very happy at Snooze again!"}
{"text":"Who the heck sits people outside in the SUN at NOON in The DESERT and then acts rude and indignant because you'd rather sit inside!?!? The manager was rude!!! I have no idea what the food taste like and really don't care... I realize it's new and very popular right now but they should get a clue and not treat their customers like they're are doing us a favor... We are not cattle!!!! Eco Friendly establishments with no misters should not have outside seating during the summer!! Way to go not impressing new patrons!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places for breakfast/brunch. Love the brewmosa as a morning cocktail and just tried the chile verde benny with soyrizo and oh my gosh.  can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Overall good place to check our for breakfast. Good food and nice atmosphere.  I had the green eggs and hammie, delish. There was a long wait time to be seated which speaks to the restaurant's popularity but the reason for the 3 stars is the less than great service once inside. Service was slow and seemed unorganized, the waitress was inattentive, and the food took 30 minutes to come out. If you have the time to spare, this is not a bad spot to check out."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, but I don't feel there's a great deal to say. Just that it's a really, really good place for brunch. It's fancy food in a casual setting, so you get the best of both worlds!  The food is great and there is a wide variety of inventive eggs benedict and pancakes to choose from, so you're all set whether you like sweet or savory for your morning meal. The coffee is good, and the servers are nice. Sometimes service is slow when they're really busy, but anyone who genuinely complains about that is a terd.  This place is also exceptionally vegetarian friendly, which I find is a tendency among breakfast joints, but it's still worth noting.   I've never had the cocktails here, so I can't speak to them, but I'm sure they're also delicious.  tl;dr You'll drop a pretty penny for breakfast/brunch/lunch at Snooze, but it's familiar food that's done well, and so it's well worth it. If you have friends visiting that appreciate good food but want to stick to something they know and keep it casual, Snooze is one of your best bets in the Valley."}
{"text":"Gluten free pancake sampler was DELICIOUS: blueberry Danish, pineapple, and sweet potato (the winner was served in maple syrup and candied nuts). Guatemalan coffee was Americano style; go for Expresso if you need more than colored water served luke warm. Busy place but we were seated immediately at 1pm on a Monday. Environment is bright diner style with nothing to absorb sound tho we could converse OK in a side booth. There's a huge parking lot to the west and this is a great addition to downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Snooze is a decent place to go for brunch if you don't mind splurging around $30 - $40 for two people. This is one of those restaurants I'll go to if I have the extra cash for a every-few-months treat. They have a laid back, somewhat retro atmosphere. Waits are never too long.   Their pancakes are fluffy with a variety of new, interesting flavors to choose from. I tried the Blueberry Danish  and a couple of others, although the Blueberry Danish sticks out in my mind the most. Sweet blueberries and tart lemon actually compliment each other very nicely.   I'm also not a fan of overly-dressed up hash browns (Snooze's include onions and spices which can be somewhat overwhelming, if I remember correctly. Honestly, it could have just been the day we went.). That's not to say that their hash browns are bad (they definitely aren't!), I'm just more of a purist when it comes to my potatoes. Give me salt and pepper.   I'd say give Snooze a visit at least once to try their unique menu and come to your own conclusion."}
{"text":"The food is always good, we are never disspointed with our choices and the atmosphere is a blast to say the least. But they don't seem to seat very fairly occording to how long we waited on one of our last visits. We waited 45 mins for an inside table after over 5 parties, who checked in after us, were seated ahead of us. It was a frustrating experience since none of the hostesses informed us that we could get seated faster if you were not specific about our table choices. Otherwise this is a wonderful breakfast joint for the entire family and it will still be a favorite of mine"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful New Years brunch with JellyBean as my server. She was great and the reason why I will return! The rest of staff was also very friendly. Food selections normal for a breakfast place, but delicious."}
{"text":"Overrated.   Nothing really special.   Eggs are eggs, pancakes are pancakes, bacon is bacon.   If you want a plain breakfast, you can go anywhere for that, otherwise you are just paying for location and atmosphere."}
{"text":"pineapple pancakes are absolutely my favorite! ordered it again today and it was just as good as last time. my friend and i ordered the breakfast buritto (it had hash browns and salsa inside) we kept on saying \"i love it\" \"this taste so good\" lol! pretty reasonable price too :) servers were so busy they got a wrong drink, etc. but we will come back for the food"}
{"text":"Very trendy modern spot that is still fairly new in the Biltmore area. We used to frequent this place at least once or twice a week however after 2 bad services in a row and a few others here and there. We made a decision to just give our gift card the manager gave us to someone else. We rather go somewhere the employees at least have an appearance that they somewhat enjoy their job and the people they are servicing. I would suggest looking into retraining your staff. Smiles, attentiveness, and being nice are part of a servers job. If you have 1 bad seed, it can spread. I believe this is the case here. It's really too bad, great looking spot, good food and drinks......the rest is just ok."}
{"text":"If you have time to wait, or get up early everyday then sure head over to Snooze. But, if you like to enjoy brunch on the weekend or are in a hurry, I recommend some other place. The wait time here is sometimes unruly. I can understand a brunch/lunch rush but being quoted over an hour seems a little ridiculous.   Their breakfast is decent. It isn't something I will wait an hour and a half to eat but if it looks like there may be enough seating for them to seat me I will head in. It doesn't mean because there is open seating that they will seat you, which I never understand. I have been here countless times now and have experienced the issue of time and seating nearly every single time. I really wanted to love the place, I really did.  Their Mmm Mmm Mimosa with pomegrante liquor is pretty good. I tried their spicy Bloody Mary and their Gazpacho Bloody Mary and  was unimpressed by both. I don't know if it is their mix or their bartender but it has been decided this is not a place for me to get Bloody Mary's.    On the last trip I had the Benny Goodman Benedict, \"Lox style\" salmon and tiny crostini rye toasty pucks. I must have missed the \"style\" portion of the description and could be wrong but I thought Lox were a salt or sugar cured salmon? Not cooked but cured giving it that smoked salmon textural  likeness? I could be wrong but this to me was just cooked salmon, not lox. It was alright....  I had previously had their duo combo Benedict and at the time I believe they may have had a corned beef hash Benedict which I no longer see and the Bella Bella Benny. I was far more impressed with those two than the Benny Goodman \"lox\" style breakie I had.  The kid had the pineapple upside down french toast and loved it! Almost ate all of it. Would be stoked if I offered the spot up to him again....  I don't know, I think this just isn't my favorite spot to grab breakfast or brunch. Maybe you will feel differently about it? It was loud, the staff was reasonable after being seated it's just too much fluff..."}
{"text":"OMG OMG! This place is the best! You walk in and they were rocking some old school MJ first thing in the morning; that was the first plus. They have these booths that are set up like a circle so everyone gets a comfy  seat ; second plus. The service is great the waitress was so nice and attentive; third plus. Then, oh and then, the food.... The breakfast burrito, taking a bite of that will set off every taste bud in your mouth. The pancakes are good too, not the best I've ever had, but the toppings make up for it. To top it all off, they have amazing drinks, and it's all really affordable! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been 3 times to this location.  The first two visits were fine, nothing to write home about.  It's a bit far from my home so I never made it a point to go here, but I needed to go to Nordstrom rack and I was a 1/2 hour early on their opening time so I went over to snooze to grab something to eat (solo with an infant in tow).  1. Service was fantastic.  Super friendly helpful staff. Got me a big comfortable table even though it was just me an a carseat with my baby.  My waitress was super friendly and chatty and another member of staff even stopped and chatted about my cute little bundle of joy.  In my opinion it's nice to go somewhere where the staff seems to enjoy their jobs and being at work and are engaging with the patrons that come in.  It definitely gives the place a positive vibe.  2.  I found my \"reason to come back over and over again\"!!! The chilaquiles Benedict was outta control delicious.  Apparently they make their barbacoa in house, which is amazing.  The time they take to stack the tortillas with the cheese in between each layer.  The very close to perfectly poached egg on top and the green chili hollandaise was sooo delicious I could have had a whole extra little ramekin of that on the side!  Only complaint was that the potatoes on the side were under seasoned (for me! Everyone is different mind you).  But honestly this Benedict was so good it didn't need a side of hashbrowns!   3.  Coffee is really good!  I've recently become kind of a coffee snob and their house blend is smooth and not bitter at all.  I added cream and stevia and I wish I hadn't added the stevia because it almost seemed like the coffee had so much great natural sweetness that the cream would have been a perfect duo with that simple yellow mug of brew.   All in all I had a very enjoyable breakfast! I will be back for that exact dish over and over again because I'm a creature of habit! ;)   Super yum!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!!! So quick and huge portions! However; be prepared to wait forever! We waited 2 and a half hours for a table of 4!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. Don't get me wrong, it is very pricey. Breakfast for just myself was $22. Drip Coffee was decent, but nothing to write home about. Peanut butter cup pancakes are out of this world. Give it a shot, just bring your wallet with you."}
{"text":"fast and friendly service!!! and they're vegan friendly!!! they offer tofu, soyrizo, and soy and almond milk. i got the tofu scramble with soyrizo, mushrooms, and caramelized onions,  hashbrowns with no butter, and sourdough toast with no butter. i also got coffee with almond milk! i have no complaints. i used to work at a breakfast place and they've really exceeded all my expectations."}
{"text":"OMG - this place is ridiculous! Please do yourself a favor and order the sweet potato pancakes...they will change your life. The chili verde benny was also amazing - I would have licked my plate if I could have! Very friendly and accommodating staff who are more than willing to make recommendations and let your order your breakfast your own way. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Lovely place with cool, retro decor, good size patio.  All staff we encountered were quite friendly, as was the GM who stopped by the table more than once.  Great menu options with a combo of traditional favorites with a twist for more modern options.  I had the OMG French toast which was amazing.  AM cocktails looked delicious, but I opted for an iced tea.   The only issue we had was navigating my friend's stroller...but it is a HUGE double stroller, so not really an issue.  Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Simply awesome!  I highly recommend this restaurant.  I got the gluten free pineapple upside down pancakes.  They were delicious and huge.  I would've had enough with just one.  I can't wait to eat there again to try other things on the menu.  Service is great, outdoor patio is dog friendly and overall there is a chill and retro vibe.  I can't wait for them to open in downtown Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  They have a great menu selection and the food is outstanding.  I would give it 5 stars if the wait wasn't so long.  Expect to wait 45-60 minutes if you come to Snooze on a Saturday.  Every time I've ever driven past the restaurant, I always see people waiting outside for a table.    The gluten free pineapple upside down pancakes are my favorite.  They are delicious and the best gluten free pancakes I've ever had.  Yum!  I wish I could have some right now."}
{"text":"This is a must!  Fun breakfast place on ASU campus Tempe AZ.  Corn Beef Hash was great with poached eggs.  Also Snooze Continental with Grapefruit Br√ªl√©e - Nice!"}
{"text":"The food is not worth the wait.  I knew what the wait was going to be like.  My family and I waited over an hour to be seated.  Our food arrived cold.  With pancakes, it's not the biggest of deals if it's cold because you just kind of deal and  you do not want to send food back.    I ordered the pot pie with gravy.  My meal was stone cold.  The waitress came by after awhile and asked how everything was.  I usually just go with the flow but when I waited an hour to be seated and waited 20 minutes on top of that to get my food, I didn't think I was speaking out of turn.  The waitress offered to \"re-fire\" my meal but the idea of reheating my meal was not appetizing because each food item re-microwaved would be not the best.  After 10 minutes, the manager came by and offered to re-make my meal.  No thanks, get me out of here.  Too little too late.  I would compare my experience to dining at banquet eating cold catered food.  Pre-made food sitting out presented well."}
{"text":"I went here because I really enjoyed Snooze in Fort Collins, CO. The Snooze in Phoenix lived up to my expectations! The pancakes are huge and delicious. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a big breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"If I could give our waitress 10 stars I would! Stacey thanks for being an amazing and hands down the best waitress! She was very very nice, she helped my friend choose one pancake out and she said you guys have to try the sweet potato one! My friend was nervous it'd taste like sweet potato and Stacey was so sure she'd like it that she bought us it! The waitress bought us a pancake to try, just because she was so confident about it...an oh goodness I'm glad she did! It was amazing ! Yes the restaurant was noisy, especially being sat by the front door but I could still hear my friend talking across from me without yelling. We were also surprised at 12:30 on a Monday was busy! We only wait 20 mins so it was fine. I did the duo eggs Benedict and it was delicious! I really like this place, the one in Tempe is also good service. I will be back just because of Stacey."}
{"text":"I showed up here on a Monday. 30 minute wait but I was curious so no big hurry. I finally grab a seat a counter. I was offered coffee a first time then never again. If you like their coffee you have to serve yourself in the corner where it's free for the waiters. The person behind the bar is way to busy to be attentive. Plus I was the oldest dude in the place and felt ignored. I'll live.   The food was OK what there was of it. My rent is less than my omelet was. It's up charge city. And the omelette was smaller than the palm of my hand. Pancakes also underwhelming. Worst part my $25 breakfast arrived cold. Would never go back again. Ever!!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on Saturday around 9. I would say the earlier you get here, the better . This place filled up quickly, but everyone seems as though they got sat pretty quickly  I started off with a cocktail of grapefruit juice, sparkling wine, and tequila. I can't remember the name of this drink, but it was pretty tasty and not super sweet. I then decided to get the Snooze Spuds Deluxe because it seemed to have everything else I wanted squeezed into one dish (potatoes, cheese, eggs, veggies, and meat). I added spinach, bacon, ham, and jack cheese to mine with over easy eggs. A few people ordered pancakes, so I got to try some of theirs.   My Spuds were delicious. They were very flavorful and filling. It was basically a mix of a hash, omelette, and over easy eggs. A perfect combination in my opinion. I also got to try the french toast (good, but not a fan of coconut) and the cinnamon bun pancake. Oh my god....that cinnamon bun pancake was so amazing. I only needed 1 pancake.   You're near the campus, so I'm guessing a lot of people working there were students, but they all were great and handled our large party very well. I will come back ."}
{"text":"I stepped inside and felt like I was in the Jetsons. Very modern, retro. Love the decor. I've been here twice and it is a fun spot for breakfast, brunch or lunch. On my last visit I got the stuffed French toast. I was disappointed by the thin slices of bread used for the toast. They should use texas toast or challach to make the dish better. The filling was also lacking in flavor. On a previous visit, I tried hash browns that were baked and seemed almost raw in the middle- a very starchy potato grainy taste. I would not order those again. Overall, an ok place. I want to try the pancakes that they are famous for."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   There is no cooler place to eat pancakes in all of Phoenix than Snooze.   SNOOZE AM EATERY: THE HISTORY   Snooze has locations in Colorado, California and 4 in the Phoenix area (Camelback, College, Gilbert and Kierland).   Every Snooze has the iconic super hype decor and edgy lighting. (see pics)   And of course, their amazing menu which includes all sorts of yummy eggs and hollandaise specials, sandwiches and many sides,  BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PANCAKES!!  Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes Sweet Potato Pancakes  Drunken Punk'n Pancakes Blueberry Danish Pancakes  Pancake of the Day Chocolate Chip Pancakes  Peanut Butter Cup Pancakes   And my favorite: Pancake Flight - which is where you can chose any 3 from above!

{"text":"Food was amazing, service was on point, and the spot had a great atmosphere. I was actually worried because I had a not so great experience last time I was here, but today was the complete opposite. I will be coming back, a lot!"}
{"text":"Had the pancakes, hash browns and egg whites. Wife and daughter had vegan/vegetarian breakfast burrito. Neither one of them could finish burrito and they said it was very good."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! One of my favorite breakfast places in all of Arizona! Everything is cooked fresh and tastes amazing! The wait is kinda long but that's expected since everyone wants to eat here. Their pancakes are to die for and their hot cocoa is A+."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday morning around 10:30 so the wait was clearly expected. Postinos was the perfect place for a Mimosa appetizer to wait out the wait. 40 minutes later, we were seated. The service was great!  The d√©cor and such was right up my alley. I loved the Jacks, the brand colors and the games! The food was simply amazing. We ordered the Bella! Bella! Benny and the OMG! French Toast with a side of bacon. OMG. It was ALL fantastic!  Cannot wait to try the pancake flight!"}
{"text":"Have been to this location several times and have felt differently each time. I've tried new things every time I go there, but this last time I was there I found my favorite menu item. To be honest I've never really understood the hype about the pancakes here. Don't get me wrong they are tasty, there just isn't really anything that excites me about them. What does get me excited though is the Breakfast Pot Pie. The rich gravy perfectly compliments the flaky puff pastry with your choice of eggs and a side of hash browns. If you're looking for something savory but still rich this is the option for you. Will definitely be getting this again when I go back."}
{"text":"Finally tried Snooze and glad we did  Have driven by Snooze many times over the last couple of months but never put 2 + 2 together to figure out that's what all the people were waiting for... though they were hanging out at the juice joint next door.   Pro's  ~Friendly staff ~Dog friendly patio ~I love a breakfast joint that can get my bacon right the first time around..I like it burned to a crisp literally and that's just what I got  ~Coffee is great ~Pancakes are amazing.. we ordered blueberry pancake instead of toast and they were mmm.mmm good. Stuffed with nice, big, fresh, juicy, real blueberries  ~The hash browns are great too ~Ping pong to play if you're not lucky enough to get there early ~Complimentary coffee while you wait for a table   Con's ~Long wait depending on what time you arrive.. Our first visit we came at 7am and we got seated right away, 2nd visit we got there at 10:30 am right smack in the middle of their brunch rush... we ended up ordering pancakes to go...they were just as good as eating them their ~If you choose to sit at the bar it's a little slower service as the bar is also prepping drinks for the whole restaurant  Overall 4 stars... we will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I had been warned it gets busy so I went early, like 7AM on a Saturday.  By the time I left about 7:45 there were only a few inside tables left.  There is nobody snoozing in the place.  All the employees were cheerful and seeing to it the customers were taken care of.  I had their take on corned beef hash and eggs and it was good.  If it wasn't so far out of my normal path I would be a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when I heard that Snooze opened up in my area, and have to say it's a great addition to the ASU area as well. If you are worried about parking there is a public parking garage just right next to Snooze, however they do not validate parking, so you will have to pay, I didn't mind because it meant easy parking and no having dig for change for parking meter, or feeding the parking meter my credit card info.   It was a Wednesday morning and I was in the mood for breakfast so I grabbed my son and daughter, who happen to both be home, which is rare and told them lets head off to breakfast.   I went with the Chiaquiles Benedict, barbacoa beef over tortillas in ranchero sauce, melted cheese, poached eggs, roasted pobalno hollandaise sauce, Pico de Gallo & cotija cheese with a chocolate chip pancake.  I have to say these are some of the best tasting benedicts I have had in a while, I just loved all the flavors and textures, and the hollandaise sauce is what makes this dish blend perfectly.  The Chocolate chip pancake was great too, just what the little kid inside me was craving, fluffy, and chocolaty good!   My daughter and son loved there dishes as well, and my son was surprised that I knew about Snooze, sometimes I think he doesn't know me at all haha.   Another great breakfast at Snooze!"}
{"text":"It was April's Breakfast Club UYE meet up and the place picked was Snooze AM Eatery, I have say I was pretty excited to try this place out, and before I even got there I knew I wanted the Pineapple Upside-down Pancakes, how good does that sound?? Oh I was so ready to give it a try!  After everyone was seated we all glanced the menu and after looking at all the great things, I was unsure of what to get, everything sounded soo good.  When it came time to order I went with the Chilaquiles Benedict.  I love eggs benedict and when you can get them styled differently that makes me happy. The Chilaquiles Benedict is barbacoa beef over ranchero sauced tortillas & melted cheese topped with poached eggs & a cream cheesy hollandaise sauce pico de gallo & cotija cheese with a side of hash potatoes.  This dish was visually stunning, and it tasted just as great, very flavourful dish, loved every bite.   Though I didn't get what I originally was wanting, I was not disappointed at all. I loved my dish and look forward to going back to try some more."}
{"text":"I wish I could have breakfast here every day. Loved it!!!! Tea was great, coffee was great servers super nice and helpful, atmosphere wonderful. Just an amazing place!!!! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place but know it's always busy and a little bit of a wait so I never bothered before now.  We had a large party and were waiting for about 30 mins to be seated but the wait was definitely worth it. The food here is incredible. I had the sweet potato mash and it was crunchy, delicious, well cooked and the sauce was spot on. Something I enjoyed was the portion wasn't bigger than my head. When food is so good I tend to over eat but the size was just right.  The server was extremely pleasant and answered a few questions from our group helping us decide on what to order (It's a fairly big menu). I tried some of the hash browns too and it was up there with the best I've had.   I felt the seating was cramped for a group our size but in no way can it bring this place down to 4 stars. Snooze is a beast of a brunch spot."}
{"text":"My son was in town visiting us with his girlfriend. They wanted to go somewhere for breakfast after I picked them up from the airport. I thought this place, located in Kierland would be the perfect spot. It was a little cold to sit on the patio - however they do have patio heaters which were nice. It was a Saturday morning and our wait wasn't too bad. They told us it would be about 30 minutes, but it was really only 20!  We had breakfast tacos and pancakes. Everything was yummy!  They brought a sample of their pancake of the day with their homemade cinnamon sauce. I could have eaten only that!  Next time I guess. Great food, great ambiance and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"#givespiceboiaraise2017 Spice boi gives service far above his pay-grade. At first unassuming in his short shorts and stache, it soon became clear his service is superior. We came in, a feeble trio- dehydrated and sallow from our previous night of sin. Spice Boi was the angel we didn't know we needed . He brought us not only a pancake-but a life changing experience . Jesus himself wept over this pancake, the syrup made from his tears. The pancakes, light and fluffy .Like tiny fairies dancing on our tongues. This pancake could end wars, or start them.   We left revitalized and renewed with a new purpose, #givespiceboiaraise2017"}
{"text":"Came there on a Saturday afternoon, yes for breakfast after a spa treatment.  The wait was 20 mins, GAME!  I heard it can be up to 1 hour (yikes).  So 10 mins in, they text me - Table is ready.  Woot woot!  Love the atmosphere.  Cool tables, chairs, and decor.  I got seated in the back of the place, nice.  I got a green hot tea.  They give you the full on leaves and everything (you know it is pretty good tea).  I got the Breakfast Pot Pie, it was ok.  It was a little bland, needed to add a tab of salt.  I had to get the chocolate chip pancake as a side.  YUM!  The service was great too!  Hash browns could have been a bit crispier."}
{"text":"I don't see myself coming back here.  I met a customer here for breakfast. Customer had eggs Benedict which looked very dry. I had a poached egg which was served below room temp. My coffee was also lukewarm at best and served with a 1/2 shot of creamer. I would've sent it all back and went somewhere else but I was with a customer and didn't want to complain or make a scene. And the flies! Maybe it's the time of year, but I was taken aback with the flies that were in the lobby. Even my customer commented.  Will not return. Do not recommend. There's plenty of restaurants in this area to patronize.  You don't need to subject yourself to mediocre service and sub-par food."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in downtown Gilbert! 70s diner theme, super cool decor and ambiance. Must be a pretty popular spot because we arrived at 8:15 am and they were already on a 15 minute wait, so keep this in mind when you go!   We sat inside and service was fairly quick and to the point. I was feeling basic and just got the 3 eggs with bacon, toast, and hash browns, but my husband ordered the breakfast burrito and it may have been the biggest I have ever seen. Really good portions for the prices. Regardless of them being busy, we were in and out in probably an hour. I noticed on our way out that their patio has corn hole and ping pong. It's a great spot for families!   Overall, great food, great time! Thanks Snooze, we will be back."}
{"text":"WE LOVE SNOOZE!! The food is outstanding... it's always one of those meals that you wish would never end! Their Bloody Mary selection is unlike any others I've seen. The staff is always on their toes and give great service!!! Everything about Snooze is what you would be looking for on the weekend or for lunch!"}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  Um, this place is AMAZING! It's my new favorite breakfast/brunch spot. Really cute indoor and outdoor area. I went on a weekday, and the service was extremely quick. I've heard this place is packed on the weekends so I would anticipate more time.   Entree: OMG French Toast It was such a great french toast. Four pieces, which is the perfect size to share, or eat all yourself. It comes with a salted caramel syrup that really pulls the entire dish together. I highly recommend it for anyone that loves french toast!   Side: Hashbrowns These are normally served in a cylinder shape, BUT I recommend ordering them \"extra crispy\" because they come flattened out, extra crunchy, and taste even better.   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The service is always amazing! Their food is delicious,  definitely worth the wait. Although the wait for a table is usually long,  once you are seated,  service is prompt,  attentive,  and the food comes fast. This is our favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This was an awesome experience.  We did have to wait a while to get in but it was worth it.  The food was amazing -- tasty, healthy, fresh, and copious.  The service was perfect.  They let me bring my dog and sit on the patio.  I only wish it were open in the evening too.  LOL.  I can't wait to return and hope to bring out of town guests!"}
{"text":"30+ of us met here for Breakfast during ASU Family weekend 7AM on a Saturday and despite them forgetting my meal it was phenomenal! I had typical Eggs Benedict which were great and several people tried other versions of the eggs Benedict and loved it.  I didn't hear a complaint and judging by the lines I saw throughout the day and the weekend ... yup they serve an awesome breakfast!  You can sit outside or inside - great place I plan on going back to."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed by the service and felt very rushed! Just wanted to have a relaxing breakfast and write in my journal plus wanted to order some pancakes after I ate my burrito but didn't have a chance cause the waitress pretty much tossed the bill at me and said nothing to me. Maybe she was having a bad day but you lost a 1st time guessed and I will go back to Liberty Market who have excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Amazing pancakes!  We had a few samples brought out for our group this morning and they were perfect. We had the server pick the spread and it would not have been my first choice, glad we let him. They were perfect! !"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend not visiting this location. I've been at least 5 times and unfortunately the service is spotty, at best.   The first few times I just chalked it up to a server, the kitchen, or the barista having a bad day, but after the 5th time, I believe this location must be poorly managed.   Twice I've waited 10 minutes or longer to be acknowledged by a server after being seated. About two thirds of the times, our order is messed up.  This last time: after waiting 20 minutes, we sat and waited 10 more to be acknowledged. By then we were ready to order and I was dying for a cup of coffee. All food came out fast and was good. I was never asked if I wanted my coffee or water refilled. Once we finished eating, we sat for another 10 minutes while our server was either on a break or just conversing with another patron. Mind you, there was a line out the door of people waiting for a table. Our table could've been turned over a minimum of 10 minutes faster... probably more like 20 if she had been attentive.   However, because this is an ongoing problem at this location, I don't think this was totally the server's fault. I believe the management has not trained people properly and/or has other issues in the implementation of their systems they are not addressing.   It is unfortunate, as the food (aside from order mistakes) usually tastes great and it's a great place to take large families. Maybe if the management spent some time at some at really busy restaurants observing how an attentive staff can turn tables over faster and make customers happier, they'd see how they can improve.   TLDR; Great food, poor service. Head to the Tempe location."}
{"text":"Snooze was so good!! We had an order for our office and the order was correct and still hot! I had the banana Nutella French toast and I've never had anything better. Highly Recommend this place !"}
{"text":"I'LL BE BACK! Rate 4.5 ( most likely will have a wait time of 20 min or longer  if you go after 9a). *First time I went to go(in CO @union station) the wait was 1.5 hours. Skipped that...and tried this location...HAPPY I WENT!  Customer Service: Very friendly and knowledgeable about the food... which helped me make my decsion.  Atmosphere: Busy, kinda loud (just cause so many people were there), good for small and large groups.  Food: Delicious and genourse portions (left w/ a full but not too stuffed tummy)  Chili Verde Benedict : Corn tortilla w/ Shredded beef(barboca(sp?)), pico de gallo, poached eggs sprinkled w/ cheese. Came w/ hash browns.  Cornbeef Hash w/ French toast (OMG): Shredded beef and potatoes (hashbrown style) crispy on the outside and tastey...yum!  OMG French Toast(name fits the dish) : Vanilla flavor enriched w/ syrup, coconut, and strawberries."}
{"text":"Just got done eating at Snooze. Nick greeted us at the door about as friendly as a host could be. Cisco, our waiter was absolutely the best. Friendly and prompt service. I had the delicious breakfast tacos and a chocolate pancake that was to die for. Definitely one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"Snooze is one of my favorite brunch spots in the valley. I love that they offer pancake trios so you can try different flavors. Their menu items are fun and so is their atmosphere. The mimosas are great - lots of flavors to choose from. Just be prepared for a long wait! On Saturdays or Sundays you may waiting on a table for an hour or more."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great service. Wonderful drinks. What more could you ask for? I love this place. Dog friendly. The flight of pancakes is a good way to figure out which one you like the best, but I liked them all!!"}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting from the typical hipster breakfast joint in the biltmore. In fact the food was amazing along with a great vintage atmosphere that could be considered a mix from the contemporary 50's with some retro 70's to spice it up. The price matched the food with everything being made from scratch along with some of the best country gravy I've ever had! I recommend anyone to go and check out the food, the ambiance, and the very nice ladies that dish you up your food along with great customer service!"}
{"text":"If I was to review this purely on food, I'd probably give it 5 stars. I've tried a few different things here and have not been diaper whatsoever. Even the coffee is amazing lol. The only drawback is that the breakfast and brunch crowd is always so so crazy. I don't think I've ever had less than a 45 min wait. But I still wait because the food is worth it! The place itself has a retro vibe to it with cool decor. I do recommend it!"}
{"text":"What a Gem!  Welcome to Phoenix Snooze!!  I have been hearing about this place for years from my sister who goes to the Denver location whenever she is there.  Once we found out it was here in Phoenix we were ready to go!  I went with her suggestion and ordered a pancake flight.  This is a genius idea and gives you your choice of 3 pancakes of your choosing.  I had their pineapple upside down, apricot buttermilk and a BanaNutella.  They were absolutely fabulous!  I know we are all trying to cut back or avoid carbs these days but this is definitely worth the splurge!  If it makes you feel better, go hike a mountain first then get some delicious pancakes!! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Expect to wait awhile if you're coming during the school year during the weekend brunch rush. This is easily one of the better breakfast places in Tempe. When I come here with a friend we like to split the gluten free pancake flight and regular 2 egg breakfast. My friend has celiac disease and they are very accommodating. The gluten free pancakes are just as good as the regular ones, super fluffy and sweet. Make sure to ask about some of the flavors that aren't listed on the menu, the cinnamon roll and sweet potato are my personal favorites. The hashbrowns and eggs are also spot on."}
{"text":"Great food, short wait times, a lot of GF options. The fresh pressed apple juice is AMAZING! Also loved the GF pancakes and seasoned potatoes!"}
{"text":"We enjoy each and every visit to Snooze, our food and service is always 5 stars! You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. My daughters favorite is the pineapple upside down pancakes. We always enjoy sitting at the bar, because the bartenders are so friendly and attentive. Today was a memorable visit, I was able to test try Lisa's bacon cocktail that she will be serving on Bacon Day! It was awesome, a little spicy, sweet, and refreshing. We will definitely be visiting on Bacon Day to enjoy her signature cocktail again! Hopefully it will be added to the menu."}
{"text":"I got the standard eggs, ham and hash brown. It was absolutely delicious. My sister had an omelet with ham and mushrooms and said it was very good. Also said the coffee was good. Our server Angela was phenomenal. Made sure we were taken care of. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Food is not only delicious, but I value their commitment to quality ingredients, local, fair trade, and organic when possible. Love their willingness to customize meals with no attitude. Cool, friendly staff, funky place, good vibe. Brunch does require a wait, but the complimentary coffee helps, and this place is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and still didn't really get to try it. I went there with my pooch and sat on the patio. Despite my flaky friend not showing up I decided to stay. It was a cloudy day and a little chilly so I ordered a hot almond milk latte. (I love places that offer more than the normal milk n soy options.) One of the staff members was very willing to turn on one of the outside heaters for me. Almost immediately after ordering my Latte it started raining. They rapidly put up the umbrellas in an attempt to keep my pooch and I dry. This is when i received several drama filled phone calls and stirred up emotion for me. I was crying, wet, and had a miserable dog. I got my latte to go.   I am writing this review Because of the great smiling service I received. I had multiple check ins by several different staff members. They truly did everything they could. Thanks guys- keep up the good work.   Can't wait to try your food."}
{"text":"First time here, love the vibe. Got a seat outside on the patio. Had great service from Melinda. She hooked it up w a tasty pancake while we waited for our food. My harvest Benny ended up not being my fav which wasn't a big deal to me but the management ended up giving me a discount. I dig this place. Everyone that works here seems happy which feeds the over all positive welcome vibe."}
{"text":"I had previously left a 4 star review so I came back in hopes of another great experience. This visit wasn't so pleasant. While I was seated quickly, I had a very strange food experience and less than stellar service.  I ordered a pancake and when it arrived it was stone cold. I flipped It over to see if it was undercooked or something and It revealed big slash marks in the pancake which put me off the rest of my breakfast. I couldn't wave anyone down because my waiter forgot I was there so by the time I was remembered, it was too late. The waiter explained that the cuts were to make sure it was done?!?! Uh if you have to destroy one side of a thin pancake to determine the doneness, you shouldn't be making them. I made perfect pancakes when I was 10 years old and never had to do that nor any other place I have ever had pancakes had the underside look like that.  On the positive, they did apologize and remove the charge from my bill. I just will refrain from the pancakes at this location going forward and continue to flip them over in the future."}
{"text":"Great casual diner to grab some delicious breakfast. My favorites are the breakfast tacos, OMG French toast, and the eggs with hash browns. This place will not disappoint and very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Delicioso! La combinaci√≥n de eggs benedict con chilaquiles es brillante! Mi esposa y yo compartimos tambi√©n french toast de vainilla se llaman OMG. Los hubiera preferido sin el coco rallado pero de cualquier forma excelente.  Llegamos un poco tarde aprox a la 1 y tardaron en darnos mesa pero comprensible por que hab√≠a mucha gente. Hay veces que prefiero ver lleno a vac√≠o!  Cielo nublado por lo que nos sentamos afuera y estuvo muy agradable.   Pidan el caf√©! Tiene un sabor agradable"}
{"text":"Came here with my family including my 3 year old and had an outstanding breakfast. Place was packed with lots of people and had a great vibe. We were told there was a 35 minute wait so we sat at a high top outside in the meantime and enjoyed yummy pineapple mimosas and the kids had juice. The table took about 45 minutes but the time flew by just hanging out and having a great time. Everybody's meal was outstanding, fresh and extremely flavorful. The portions were spot on and left you satisfied and not overly stuffed and gross feeling after. It was a great way to spend a Sunday morning with family and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Snooze is consistently awesome. Food - beverages - service...  The only downfall is that your food almost always hits the table before a glass of water and/or your coffee does.  Not sure if that's a big deal to everyone. I'm just normally thirsty AF."}
{"text":"Ummm.. Worth the wait is all I can say.   Positives:  This old fashioned diner style place is adorable. I was wondering why the wait was so long.. But soon figured it out after my first bite. Wow! It is a fun place to go when you have the time.  Both the savory and sweet dishes are amazing.  I preferred mine, the eggs Benedict to the pancakes but those were also crazy good. I recommend ordering a side of bacon as it was delicious.   Negatives: Don't go here if you're in a rush. You will certainly have to wait your turn"}
{"text":"Yes. One of our favorite spots. It may not be a favorite locally owned place but their food is delicious and the staff is always friendly. Will defiantly continue to come here. Try the Benedict's and pancakes we have never gone wrong."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict - salsa verde is untouchable.  Wow so freaking delicious.  I seriously day dream about this stuff.  I don't know how to explain it other then you won't be disappointed.  It has so much flavor and every bite will take you closer to heaven."}
{"text":"The place is average. Like most people have commented it's not worth all the hype. The specialty items on the menu and morning drinks make it unique. The service is average. For as many people as they have on staff, I'd expect better service.  Personally, I still prefer Liberty Market or the Farmouse."}
{"text":"The place oversell their service. You can be waiting for a 90 min. Crazy wasting time. Go somewhere else or get there earlier. Not a good experience. Offering to get you the food and you eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"In town for a wedding and we showed up around 10 on a Friday.  20 minute wait but it was totally worth it.  Not only was this one of the most flavorful and delicious breakfasts Ive ever had, but our waiter Flip (I think was his name) was above and beyond.  I've honestly never had a waiter foresee the needs of the table so quickly and instantly.  You'd thing this was a $200 a plate steak house.  Amazing service and amazing food, I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Yum!! We ordered the pancake of the day as a appetizer and it was coconut mocha! It was really good & one pancake was just enough for my fianc√© & I to share. Wasn't too sweet or heavy either!  We both opted for the house made granola, Greek yogurt, grapefruit and hashbrowns! Everything was Delish! Overall the breakfast was pretty heavy on the sugar but we are on vacation so it was a good indulgence   Service was great, we sat outside on the patio & it was a beautiful morning.  I would recommend the cake of the day!"}
{"text":"Amazing and relaxed breakfast spot!! The decor as you walk in is out of this world--literally it looks like you stepped into the 1950s. The staff was so receptive and kind and seated my friend and I right away. Snooze's menu is extensive, but their main feature is their pancakes. I ended up getting their egg scramble, which comes with three choices of topings (on them) and and toast and hashbrowns. I got my scramble filled with chicken sausage, Spinach and feta; and selected rye toast as my side. Oh wow, the scramble was so delicious! Everything was so fresh, light, and tasty--only thing I added was a little bit of peppet for some spice otherwise everything was great! This includes the rye toast that came with their homemade jam!! The hashbrown cake rounded everything out and was just enough for a great 11am breakfast!!  I love that Snooze uses local ingredients in all of their breakfast and brunch items! Totally check them out when you need to hit the snooze and may miss making your own breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Quinoa hot cereal and eggs Benedict were to die for! Our waitress was so accommodating as she allowed me to combine my eggs benedict with two different kinds as I could not decide between the Bella Bella and the Benny Goodman. So they gave me one of each so that was great!   Great coffee, great patio seating, and just great food!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We are here visiting and wanted to find a great breakfast place. I came across this recommendation and got in the car and showed up. The menu has tons of options, the servers are really attentive and everyone was super friendly. Coffee selection is very good and boy, the breakfast drink menu was fantastic! Tje food was genersouly portioned and very very good! A job well done by Snooze!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and great mimosas! I love the d√©cor and also love the outside seating area!  One of our favorite places to get breakfast!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning breakfast .... Get there before 8:30am or be prepared to wait. Food delicious Spouse had pancakes and we are pancake snobs, no one ever can meet our expectations.  These were blueberry pancakes and they were as close to homemade as I've tasted. DElicious Mom and I split an egg/spinach sandwich on ciabatta with holland aide aioli. Kitchen split in two plates for us always a very classy touch. Aioli served in side instead of sandwich ...great move so each ca put as little or much as they want. Ciabatta was fresh and soft, aioli was just the right flavor smack for the sandwich. Only complaint is they should have soy creamer not just soy milk. Our Sunday morning was late March so at that hour it was beautiful and cool.  But all they have is garage doors open and patios with umbrellas. Owners are from Colorado ... Obviously don't have a concept of 120 degree weather.  They should be made to eat an entire lunch meal on patio from April in and rethink their cooling strategy  Sales will certainly tell.  No matter how delicious the food is, it can't be enjoyed under little shade and no cooling"}
{"text":"The Sandwhich I Am is amazing! Hash browns are addicting! Get the pancake flight. Great service and awesome decor. This is a HUGE plus for our neighborhood. Will continue to go back"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot!! Amazing Bloody Mary's... Pancakes are beyond words.  They also have a great selection of healthy choice!!"}
{"text":"Hmm...trying to understand all of the 5 star reviews. I definitely need to give this place another try, I think. We came in late this morning (ok fine it was closer to noon) for some brunch. The place was hoppin' and we were told there was a 30-45 minute wait. We grabbed some coffee at the complimentary station (a plus!) and took a seat to wait. After about 15 minutes the hostess offered up 2 spots at the \"communal\" table to anyone who wanted to take it, so we snatched it up!  It took quite awhile to get a waitress over for our drink orders, and this lady was NOT happy. Couldn't crack a smile to even fake it. So that was a bummer. After about 20 minutes, the food came out. The food was pretty good, I'm missing where all of the rave food reviews are coming from, but I don't doubt that other items on the menu are fabulous. I got the eggs benedict (one traditional style and the other \"Bunny! Bunny! Benni\" I believe it was called, which had shaved prosciutto, arugula, balsamic...I was not blown away by any of it. The hash brown cake that came with it was kind of bland and a bit under-cooked. My fianc√© (!) had the breakfast burrito. It was gigantic and he devoured every bite and loved it. Will try again, order something else, and hope for a server who can muster up a smile :)"}
{"text":"This was a quick breakfast stop for me as I headed to the airport and it was worth it!! Nice decor. An updated modern venue. On ASU campus. Hours are 6:30-2:30 pm. I sat at the counter and the young lady served with a smile. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The portion sizes were great and will have you happy and full! I ordered the OMG French toast and highly recommend it!! I also had a side of chicken sausage, it was the best I had so far!! And it was flat like a patty versus the links you normally see. Great atmosphere and breakfast!"}
{"text":"It's ok, the food wasn't unique in taste. Staff was great though.  I got the breakfast tacos. They're ok, but taste wise nothing flavorful. I ordered mushrooms and avocado with it. They barely put any mushrooms on there and then didn't put the avocado. When we asked for it they brought out maybe 1/3 of an avocado so 1 Slides for each taco for $2.  Grapefruit mimosa was really good."}
{"text":"I met up with some friends here when I was heading out of town.  They had great food and was very kid friendly.  The pancakes were very good."}
{"text":"Always great food. Always quick service. My favorite breakfast place. Good music good vibes and great Columbian coffee to get your day started off. Staff is full of energy."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of great reviews about this place so I decided to check it out because of their famous pancakes. When I arrived the line was so long so I opted to take out. One of the waiters was very accommodating however the one of the ones up in front didn't seem to care if I was there. I waited about 30 minutes and when I finally sat down to eat my food. The beacon was burnt the egg was under cooked and the pancakes were alittle dry and hard. I hate to say the food didn't even compensate for the service. I was disappointed. Unfortunate for the first time experience."}
{"text":"Has great breakfast options but I'm not sure I would wait in line for a long time to receive this service.  Honestly, I go sometimes because I know Michael Phelps eats here A TON!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. I had the blueberry pancake. Delicious!!  The service is great and our waitress JENNA is on point. She is very attentive. Bonus! House coffee (Guatemalan blend) is my fave. Come super early it gets busy!!"}
{"text":"A friend invited me to this gem and I immediately knew why. The warm and welcoming staff took care of me like an honored guest in their home. The atmosphere was nostalgic with out being corny. It feels like a small family business, but runs like a well oiled machine. I hope they open one in Hawaii soon."}
{"text":"After hearing countless reviews and people raving about Snooze we decided to brave the crowds and long wait on a Sunday morning, bad idea. After a quoted forty-five Minute waited we received our table was ready via text... It wasn't quite \"ready yet\", after arriving to the counter we where told it would be just one minute.. Or twenty more of standing inside being pushed and shove by the crowd, after being told three times our table was being cleaned, and six or seven tables being sat before us, I watched as the host cleared a table a few rows in and FINALLY sat us, we then waited ten minutes to be greeted by a server who was visually displeased. As the meal progressed getting the smallest things to the table as water and ketchup seemed to not only be the most excruciatingly painful thing for our server but also took plenty of time.. The food was okay, took a bit longer then expected, but the service left a sour taste in our group of sevens mouth that we just couldn't shake.. I don't know if I'll give snooze a second shot or not, the service was some of the worst I've had in the industry."}
{"text":"Delicious! Perfect egg Benedict and awesome flight of pancakes. Will definitely come back the next time we visit our son at ASU"}
{"text":"My first visit I ordered the breakfast tacos and they were delicious. My second trip I ordered the breakfast burrito and the green chili had a little spice. I had added ham with the burrito and it was most pleasing.   Their americanos are pretty good. However,  I cannot say the same about the coffee pancakes. Otherwise, great service and great food."}
{"text":"Probably best breakfast in town. Cage free eggs and best pancakes and great service from Charles and Echo."}
{"text":"Visiting from Maryland and this brunch place was so good! I got the Ham Benedict III which is eggs Benedict and it was great! My friend got the pineapple upside down pancakes and they were sooo good!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast the other morning and I loved it! Place is very cute inside. When we got there our waitress told us that their specialties were pancakes and benedicts so I opted for their chilaquiles Benedict and was very satisfied! My husband got the huevos rancheros with chorizo and that was really good too! We are within walking distance so we will definitely be back for more :)"}
{"text":"Well food not bad but good also, take long time and also was cold really cold, friend also have cold food, 5 out of 10, coffee was cold if I want a ice coffee I would ask for it 5 out of 10, us timer service awful, all waiters was on all the tables, is like it to many hands to making a cake, keep asking for service over all 2 out of 10, won't come back"}
{"text":"Went there last week for the first time And I have to admit the service was not as good as I expected. My girlfriend and I waited for almost 30 mins for our food to come out. When the food did actually come out, it was already cold so we asked for it to be heated up again. The food was decent, but the fact that we had to wait for another 15 mins longer to get a nice heated brunch was quite unreasonable. I'd probably go back one day to give it another try, but not any time soon."}
{"text":"We got to Snooze on an early Saturday morning around 8am.  We got there and there was no wait. We were seated outside and I decided to get the corn beef hash.  You are able to substitute your hash browns or toast for a pancake for I decided to get a pineapple upside down pancake instead of toast.  I almost ate the whole thing.  The pancake was probably one of the best pancakes I have ever had in a really long time.  It wasn't too sweet and it was really fluffy.  I left a happy camper.  I will come back again and my recommendation is to come early to avoid the waits because as we were leaving, there was at least six or seven people waiting."}
{"text":"ONCE WAS ENOUGH.....My wife and I had been here once, the service was slow and it took 25min. for our food to get to the table. The food was good , and the place was packed. on our second visit there may have been 20 customers in the place and just as many staff. The girl who seated us threw 2 menus on the table and walked off. 16 min. later nobody had taken our drink orders or said a word to us. The server was playing with a customers dog. we left and will never return. Hipsters may love this joint and the trendy setting , Snooze and Hipsters have one thing in common ALL SHOW AND NO GO."}
{"text":"All you need to know is that you should go ! !   If I lived here I'd eat here once a week.   Yes, it is busy but all good things are.    The staff is very nice and the service is performed perfectly.  EXCELLENT ! !"}
{"text":"Sweet or savory. No matter what you order from the menu, the food is delicious! Great staff with wonderful service. We drive out of our way to visit this Snooze location because we get treated by the manager, Travis."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in the valley!! Love this place. I want to go back tomorrow for the sweet potato pancakes."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place. Every time I drove by there has always been a long wait. When we were able to try it on a Monday morning. We got seated right away. After sitting down it was extremely cold and loud inside. When we asked our server (girl with tats and piercings) if we could move outside and we got major attitude. After moving outside our new server was friendlier. My husband got the breakfast burrito and I got the Sammy we both thought the food was good but a little overpriced for what you get. We didn't think this place was anything special."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly unbiased here. I relocated from Denver. Year ago and my former residence was next to the Littleton location. It's not uncommon to have a 30 minute wait Tuesday morning at 10:00am. I love ALL the Benedict's and infused alcohols make for a fun breakfast too. The Town and Country location (great choice btw, good culture match) is of the same quality and it shows in the staff. A must try for foodies and families that like fun, good food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Kiersten, the assistant general manager, really went above and beyond for me today! I am in the service industry as well and always appreciate genuine hospitality and a desire to help others. Will definitely be recommending Snooze to the guests at my hotel."}
{"text":"The free coffee is a great start and it taste freshly brewed. The whole ambience is amazing and the chicken sausage has a little kick but great flavor. The black beans have a zesty flavor and the menu has so much more that you just have to try"}
{"text":"I really love the interior design and the free coffee during the wait. We went at 7:45 to avoid the rush but we still ended up waiting about 20 minutes. I can't imagine going during peak times. Our waitress seemed really busy but she was super nice cause she even wrote on our to go boxes which pancake is which cause we were confused earlier. The food was good but it wasn't anything extraordinary. If the wait was longer, I would have no problem going to some other breakfast place."}
{"text":"Wow what a waste of time... rancid food and way over priced. Stay away unless you hate yourself. Recommend farm house down the road or even IHOP hahaha"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times now and the customer service keeps getting better and better! Their staff are always friendly and super inviting! Not to mention to food is also great! Their pancakes are the best I have had! I totally recommend the blueberry pancakes. I recently brought my mom with me and she said their French toast was the best she has ever had!"}
{"text":"We walked to Snooze from home with our dog this am to try it for the first time.  My wife was VERY excited and had been talking about it for weeks.  Although they were busy, we left our name and they asked for a cell# in order to text us when our table was ready.  What a great idea and why isn't everyone doing this???  The hostess said about ten minutes and was spot on.  We sat on the patio where our dog was not only welcomed but doted on and brought fresh water.  I love anyplace that loves my pooch!  Onto breakfast!  The menu is different, very different.  Be prepared to expand your breakfast horizons and I mean that in a most awesome way!  If I were going to say anything at all negative about this place (which I'm not) it would be the \"coffee narrative\". The coffee, while good, is not worthy of the two page slightly pretentious story of how it came to be on our table.  So...I had a sweet potato pancake with pecans and caramel syrup that was like revisiting Thanksgiving only better, and two totally different, totally awesome versions of eggs Benedict.  My wife had two other versions of the Benedict and we literally wiped the plates.  I'd be here all day describing them so you'll just have to go and try it.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really like Snooze, so I'm happy to now have one in my neighborhood.  I've already visited this location a few times and I'd have to say it gets better every time.  On my last visit, I had the OMG.  It was the bomb.  I also had an iced caramel mocha, which also was the bomb.  The wait staff and baristas, bomb.  Even the managers, BOMB.  I will be back soon and often.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"On campus in Tempe, went on a Saturday morning so the wait was long as expected but once we were sat we had a great waiter and delicious food. One of my favorites now! I tried the Snooze Simple dish with 3 eggs, choice of meat, hash browns, and toast! It was a perfect amount of food for the price and it was delicious! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and pretty good food.  Gets busy during the school year, so plan for that."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Snooze was in Denver, so I set my expectations high considering my wonderful experience. I came to visit my boyfriend in Gilbert and noticed a location in town, therefore I couldn't resist stopping in to tame my breakfast-loving appetite. This location did NOT disappoint.   Upon entering, I immediately noticed the similar decor. I'm sure the decor is parallel among all the Snooze locations and it gives it a classy charm. Although we had to wait, a waitress came by to ask if we wanted to start with anything to drink while we waited. The Snooze experience was off to a good start!  Once seated, my boyfriend and I browsed over the menu of atypical breakfast fare. Snooze has your basic eggs and pancakes, but they know how to take it up a notch to keep customers coming back for more. Our server immediately came to take our drink orders, then we made our breakfast decisions. Customer service seemed to be a priority at Snooze.  My boyfriend ordered the Sandwich I Am. Although it wasn't up my alley, it sure pleased him! The pretzel bun seemed to really make the sandwich what it was, and the hollandaise sauce to top on was a surprisingly good touch! If you're into bacon, my boyfriend recommends ordering some bacon to put on the sandwich. The bacon (which I tried) is some of the best bacon I've ever had.  I had the three egg omelet with hashbrowns. The eggs were nice and fluffy and the vegetables were fresh. However, the hashbrowns definitely stole the show! I'm very picky about my hashbrowns, but these were not too greasy and not too soggy. They had the perfect texture and had nice crispy bits. I could easily just eat the hashbrowns as a meal. Make sure you order some if your meal doesn't already come with them.  All in all, I highly recommend coming to Snooze. Great customer service, great food. This place still stands as my favorite breakfast joint (even as a Chicago foodie!)."}
{"text":"Snooze is a special breakfast eatery. Service is top notch, the ambiance is warm and friendly and the food choices fit most every palate. The flights of pancakes make it possible for everyone at your table to sample their deliciousness. I could go on but you should try it yourself. Oh and btw, on the weekend if you arrive after 9 expect a wait to be seated. It's ok...it's worth it."}
{"text":"Everything was really good from food to  service and even the ambience. The wait was really long but so worth it. I would definitely recommend it if you don't mind waiting an hr to eat."}
{"text":"I have been to Snooze several times for weekend Brunch and it is always, hands down, a phenomenal experience. I don't know why I continue to be surprised by how quickly and friendly their staff works to get customers seated and served (without making the dining experience feel rushed) - especially being that they are one of the most popular places in town to catch a Sunday brunch.   The last two times I have dined there, I have had Jessica as my server and she was phenomenal - especially considering we had a large group with several children in our party. She was so kind and patient with our out of town guests (who had never dined at Snooze before) offering up a variety of her favorite choices. She was so sweet and friendly with the children (they LOVED her!) and made sure our waters (and mimosas) stayed full.   She checked on us often without being over bearing and all of her recommendation on food were perfect. We had a range of savory and sweet selections and I, honestly, couldn't find one thing to complain about from any of it. From start to finish every experience I have had and every member of their staff was wonderful.   There is just a great vibe and energy that exudes from Snooze and the delicious food just makes it the total brunch package. We will be back time and time again."}
{"text":"First time finally trying this place out.  I've been here 4 times but it is always too busy to get a seat without waiting 1-2 hours.  This time we came at 730am on a Sunday which was the perfect time since dining room was half full and patio is empty.  The menu is eclectic and different from any other breakfast place.  They have a list of hollandaise concoctions, breakfast tacos that are to die for, many different pancake options and the typical breakfast fare such as omelettes, eggs etc.  the service was fast and super friendly.  We had 3 different servers talk to us and make sure we were taken care of.  We will definitely be coming back and if there is a wait, it is indeed worth waiting.  Until next time."}
{"text":"Have I ever had a bad experience at Snooze? No I have not!   To be honest, Snooze is probably my favorite breakfast joint. I love every single thing I've tried there (and I've tried a lot). My favorite thing on the menu to order are their different variations of Eggs Benedict. I'm a sucker for some good EB.   And then there is this heavenly creation called the Pineapple Upside Down Pancake. Stop. Or don't. Either way, I'm about that pancake.   The servers, despite waking up before dawn, are always in chipper moods and are quick at accommodating your needs. While you wait, they're even out on the patio grabbing drink orders to get you started. \"I'll have like 8 of your various mimosas please.\"  I adore this place. The decor is super unique, it makes you feel like you've traveled back in time with all of the super retro patterns, but it is definitely a great way to start your morning with all of those sunny, bright colors.   Seriously, Snooze is always top of my list for breakfast. (Ask all of my friends)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Really nice service and unique twist on traditional breakfast. I live in the west valley but will be making the haul for this place."}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict are really good and the best part is you can choose two kinds and get half and half!!   The wait can be long but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast restaurants around (right up there with crackers)  The Eggs benedict were awesome.   Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Always amazing! The staff, food, and drinks are top awesome! The wait may be a bit long but soooo worth it! Definitely try one their daily pancakes!"}
{"text":"After a quick AM flight from ONT into PHX, on a rainy Saturday morning, we decided to partake in the most important meal of the week - Brunch.  A quick look on Yelp for some good eats and SnoozeAM had all the stars and solid reviews to coerce us into taking the drive into Tempe.  The line was long, wait time longer but low and behold two seats were available at the bar. We giggled with glee as we swooped in on the coveted bar stools. Immediately we were greeted and given menus, and we already knew that we were ready for our Mary's. I had a spicy Bloody Mary and my Love had the Beet Juice Mary. Different but good. More on the refreshing side. Very nice!  I ordered the egg white frittata Florentine and hubby had the \"pick two\" eggs Benedict ... chilaquiles and pulled pork. He wasn't a fan of the chilaquiles but loved the pork one.  Earlier we debated on whether or not we should split a pancake. Our server must have overheard this small debate because she came out with this amazing complimentary pecan caramel pancake for us to share!  Fifth star earned!  Menu is full of goodness and we would for sure go back!  Five stars \" brunch and beyond!\" Review for SnoozeAM!"}
{"text":"We live minutes down the street. My husband and I ordered takeout on a Sunday morning. Everything was cold but the taste of the OMG French toast was amazing. The breakfast tacos were Ok I'm sure they would have tasted better if they were hot. We never received a drink for my son's kids meal. I would give this place another try but wouldn't order take out again."}
{"text":"Went here for my brothers birthday.  The wait was a little long, but totally worth it.  The waiter was very polite and quick.  He was on top of our drinks and grabbing us refills.  I had asked him to \"surprise me\" and his concoction was simply amazing.  They even have a soyrizo \"meat\" option for those of us on a plant based diet.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The best Eggs Benedict that I've ever had!! I ordered a half entree which was more than filling! Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in with high expectations and they were definitely met! For 9:30 am on a Tuesday they were very busy, and we were told there would be a 15 minute wait, or we could sit at the bar right then. We chose to sit at the bar. Our coffee was brought right away and our cup was never less than half full! Our food came very quickly and was delicious! I ordered the quinoa porridge and it was AMAZING. My boyfriend got the OMG french toast and he absolutely loved it too. The service was amazing as well, very friendly and attention! Thank you snooze!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place with a laid back casual atmosphere but super nice food. My wife and I split the pot pie and Bella Bella Bennys twice. Both are great choices."}
{"text":"My new go-to breakfast joint in the neighborhood. Yay, Denver! Thanks for bringing us #Snooze!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Snooze when I lived in Denver. I was beyond excited to see it in my neighborhood a few months ago!  Pros: Breakfast tacos are amaze-ing Coffee drinks Bloody Mary's Patio in the fall Management is on top of things  Cons: Service can be kind of slow Always a wait on the weekends"}
{"text":"Was not worth the long wait. Eggs Benedict was tiny, ask for the hashbrown a extra crispy or else they come in an ice cream scoop shape and are soft. Food took over 30 minutes to come out."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Snooze at home in SD, so I was really excited to see how the the Snooze in my new home fares against my other home. Verdict: very reliable. Same delicious options, similarly great staff, and same indecision in what the heck I want to order!! (Thank goodness for flights!)   I came with a party of 40 and we were able to make reservations for outside, which was really nice since I'd been accustomed to waiting for AGES in San Diego. From what I've heard from other friends, the wait here in Gilbert is similarly long. But hey, what would you do for a reliable and moderately priced brunch?! I definitely think I'll be coming back around when I want a good brunch fix and a small piece of home! (oh or just a bunch of different bennies!)"}
{"text":"I was so happy to find this place when I came for a visit. Staff was on point, food was amazing, and the design/atmosphere of the place was great. Was so grateful for the gluten free options that they had."}
{"text":"Great place to go for an energetic atmosphere. The place is very colorful and really upbeat in spirit. The cocktail selection is really unique and the menu is a lot on the healthy side so that's a plus. This is definitely one to visit again and make it one of my favs for breakfast."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot! Substitutions encouraged meaning it's great for picky eaters and wonderful selections! The tacos and burrito are always a hit as well as the spuds deluxe. They always are offering free drinks and pancakes too! Overall a great experience"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is so great....the decor, the AMAZING food and the best waitress, Jessica, that anyone can ask for!  The pancakes are to die for and while I don't like Eggs Benedict normally the Chili Verde one with pork was a great one.  The service is top notch and me and my girlfriends learned so much about this place and what they stand for...thanks again to Jessica.  I only wish we had something like this in our little town of Brentwood, CA!  It would make a killing.  Can't wait to try other locations during my travels but this place is worth any wait.  Jessica is a top notch waitress who you can tell truly loves the company and her job.  Thanks again for making it a wonderful experience Jessica...you rock!!  YUM"}
{"text":"I'm a Denver-ite, so I'm of course a huge Snooze fan/regular. I'm easily won over with decadent pancakes and incredibly boozy iced coffee.  Visited the Tempe location with a friend and was not disappointed. We got chilaquiles benedict, salsa verde benedict, OMG french toast & a PB cup pancake. For starters - WAY too much food for two people but, we're gluttons for punishment and breakfast foods so we stuffed ourselves into oblivion. The sweet eats are always my favorite - but the benedicts were damn good too. The chilaquiles was my favorite of the two.  Only downside is the wait times are almost always SO. LONG. But, that's a sign of a good place, no? We put in for two and were told about a 30-45 min wait, which is pretty standard around late Sunday brunch time. They serve coffee in the standing area while you wait though, so that's a nice occupier. However, if bar top seating comes open it's first come first serve and we scooped up two spots about 15 minutes into the wait. Scoooooore! It's also located on campus, so take that for what it's worth - we figured it would be filled with boozing college kids (because you know, we're SO old & far removed from that lifestyle in our late 20's ha!), but it wasn't at all an issue.   Eat the pancake flight. Get the AM Manhattan. Then go home & take a nap."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday, and it made me sick as a DOG! I will NEVER eat here again!  To give you some context, I do not have a sensitive stomach; friends often refer to me as having a stomach of the Gods. I can have bloody mary's for breakfast, chipotle for lunch (with all of their salsas), and indian food for dinner... without so much as a rumble from my tummy.  That being said, I ate one of their new sammies, the name of which escapes me. But basically, it was a pretzel bun, topped with cheesy eggs, a sausage patty, and cheddar hollondaise sauce... and one of the worst mistakes of my life.   I am still recovering, unable to eat or keep fluids down, but I do seem to be improving slowly.   Before this awful experience, I had eaten at the Snooze in Denver and found it to be a decent breakfast spot with bizarre, overly sweet pancakes. For that experience, I give them three stars... for this last experience, I give them none (but yelp makes me give at least one).  And getting sick once, is one too many times for me. This should NEVER happen at ANY resturant. Will definitely NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Had the corned beef hash with eggs and a side of hash browns,outstanding the coffee is brewed medium,the service is always with a smile perfect breakfast for spring training"}
{"text":"I am writing this review based on service. We went in on a Friday morning around 820. There was no wait and a bunch of tables inside or outside. We got a table for 2 inside against the window, sat down and looked at the menu. Another party of 2 sits down two tables from us about 5 minutes later. Now we are waiting for a waitress to at least take our order or offer us coffee or water. Now it's about 10 minutes and then the waitress comes and takes the order of the party of 2 and even brought them water. She made about 3 trips to that table and didn't even acknowledge us. It's not my job to flag her down .....it wasn't busy and she should have noticed us. It's been 20 minutes so my wife and I just get up and say eff this place and go to The Farmhouse(service there is excellent got our food in 15 minutes). I will give this place another chance and see if service is still the same but I'll make sure I'll bring a white person with us so we can get some service. just my opinion."}
{"text":"Some of the best pancakes I've ever had! Service is a bit slow sometimes but overall a must every time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast spot with unique and delicious foods. The egg white frittata was really good, nice sized portion. My husband said his corned beef hash was one of the best he's ever had.  We've never had a pineapple upside down pancake and it didn't disappoint us. Even their wheat toast was on point."}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast I have had in awhile! Was so amazing I wish I could make you taste it while reading this review. I got the snooze classic and my man got the steak & eggs benny! They both were perfection! Our server was amazing as well, very down to earth and super nice. We will definitely be back. I honestly do not know how anyone could rate this place any less than 5 stars. We are impressed!"}
{"text":"Busy breakfast spot with lots of creative and yummy sounding choices from eggs Benedict to breakfast sandwiches, French toast and pancakes. It's a bright and cheery interior with lots of booths and after 8 am a crowd of people waiting.  We sat at the counter which was nice and enjoyed the almost fresh squeezed OJ while we waited for our food. I tried the cinnamon roll pancake (sweet concoction of crunchy pecans and caramel topping a large fluffy pancake) that was very good and my wife had the breakfast sandwich which came with crunch hash browns and was more than she could eat.  I'd definitely go back - especially if I'm up early."}
{"text":"First time at this location and Victoria is AMAZING. Couldn't ask for a better first time experience. THANK YOU. #victoriaforpresident"}
{"text":"First timer! Grabbing a quick bite for a late lunch and decided to go with breakfast. I got a pretty basic egg white omelet with toast and hashbrowns. The jam was good.   Standard and decently priced. Ambience of the restaurant was nice and the size is what you would expect for being right in the middle of a college campus. Weekends this place is packed but when we came after 12 on a Monday there was plenty of room."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me or reads my reviews knows that I LOVE brunch!! Snooze is awesome! I went to get my snowboard waxed across the street and one of the employees suggested this place.   I got a plate with smoked salmon and other delicious things that I can no longer remember but tasted delicious. They give a lot of food and I had enough for a second meal later that day. If it weren't a weekday and I didnt have class later, I would have definitely gotten a drink, or two.... They looked delicious! Instead, I got tomato juice, which I also love. My friend got their pancakes and we got to try 3 of them. The sweet potato pancakes tasted like heaven. i was extremely skeptical and did NOT want to taste them, but am SO glad I did.   We decided that we are definitely coming back and bringing more people so we can get a lot more food and try EVERYTHING. :)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Snooze for months, but they get so busy on weekends! I begged my husband to get up by 7am so we could head there early. We arrived with plenty of open tables. I had the pancake flight - pumpkin, sweet potato, chocolate peanut butter cup, and my husband had the corned beef hash. I also had a mimosa with orange juice and the dirty drunken chai. I was drunk before 8am. :D The food was fantastic, staff is super friendly, and I love the ambiance. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Tempe! I have probably been here about 4 times since it opened and it's now my go to breakfast spot in Tempe.  The decor is so fresh and cute but also inviting. Every time I've been the servers are great and always able to give suggestions. I have had all of the eggs Benedict but my absolute favorite is the chiliquiles benedict! It's eggs benedict with salsa, barbacoa, and a stack of tortillas instead of an English muffin. Seriously delicious! If you can't decide which eggs Benedict you want you can do half and half.  Speaking of half and half, my boyfriend was deciding between 2 different french toasts and our server said he could do half of each. They seriously go above and beyond to make their customers happy and encourage customization.   Next time you need a breakfast close to ASU or you want to show off Tempe to out of towners, come here!"}
{"text":"Pancake Platter is amazing. Regular size cakes with great toppings and flavors. Got pineapple upside down, I Want Samoa and Blueberry Danish. Blueberry was my favorite by far with that lemon cream cheese filling."}
{"text":"On reading my prior review, I was contacted by someone from Snooze and they offered to pay for me giving them another shot at their Benedict. They sent me a handwritten note, which impressed me- few people do that!  I returned and everything was perfect. The dish was seasoned very well and cooked to perfection; the atmosphere was buzzing and the servers very prompt and friendly. Such a cool location too.   I'm stoked I found another terrific brunch place in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Never been here and didn't gush about all the food. Shrimp and Grits is out now now and it was like I was in NOLA. Normally place skimp on the spice on this dish but as expected Snooze doesn't."}
{"text":"It was packed out when we got here. Waited 20 min for 2 people. Music was a little to loud.   My sister got the quinoa porridge. She loved it!  I got the blueberry pancake. Soooooo good!   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Best Brunch joint around! I love Snooze- the food, the drinks, the service, the overall vibe. I've never had a bad meal at Snooze and I love to try different things from the menu every time I go. Their specials are always spectacular too, especially when they throw out random pancakes. If you're in the Highland & 51 area, skip all of the other breakfast joints and head straight to Snooze for a great meal at a great price- You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 breakfast burritos -   One of them had ranchero sauce which taste basically like tomato paste - no flavor at all, no spice at all.   The other was ordered with green chile - equally lacking in flavor but better than the ranchero.   The green chile burrito was also ordered with avocado, a 2.50 cost, and there was no avocado present in the burrito at all.   Both burritos contained more black beans than any other ingredient - there were maybe 1-2 scrambled eggs in each burrito but how could you taste the egg when every bite contained mostly black beans?  Both burritos had hashed Browns in them, however, my definition of hash browns is crispy fried potato strings and these were virtually raw sliced potatoes with not a single bit of brown showing on them.   For my total cost being 16.50 for the green chile burrito and about 13 for the ranchero this is just a huge huge waste of time and money. I could have eaten at Chelsea's kitchen and had an amazing chilaquiles with breakfast mimosas for the same price and been far far happier.  Honestly this is the biggest most overhyped breakfast restaurant I've encountered with prices that are on par with a resort and food on par with a high school cafeteria.   Save your time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wowzers! Pineapple Upside Down pancake is out of this world yummy. Perfectly poached eggs. Crispy hash browns upon request. Bloody Mary ...mmmm good. Good service. The food was so good I went back again a couple days later while in town and brought a friend."}
{"text":"I was here Saturday for breakfast.  The wait was 50 minutes, so plan on sitting and chatting for an hour or so before breakfast.  The food is your standard breakfast fare with a cool Snooze flare; like shaped hash browns and pancake of the day.  If you're having the Snooze Breakfast (3 eggs, meat, hash browns, and toast) try the pulled pork (DELISH!) and adds a unique element to breakfast.  The frittata is a healthier option and looked amazing (my friend ordered it.) Snooze has a full bar with unique cocktails that support nursing your hangover or simply enjoying Sunday morning mimosas; try them out for an enhanced breakfast experience.  The backyard patio has fun/games/misters/ and it's freaking hot in AZ so go early or in the spring/winter/fall...    To the restaurant:  I recommend putting a water and coffee station out on the patio; the water station inside is usually blocked with people waiting for their table because it's 120 degrees out! You do a good job with the misters to keep guests cool\"ish\"; but I recommend big fans and extra sunshades for the front patio!  This would upgrade my review to 5-stars."}
{"text":"It is a great place to eat. The food is delicious. One suggestion is that fruit should be one of the side choices instead of charging extra."}
{"text":"What a breakfast!  It was busy and we thought we would have to wait to be seated... But we got right in. Great service and outstanding food. I need to come back for their array of Bloody Mary drinks."}
{"text":"Decor is adorable, food is ok. I don't feel like the quality of food matches the prices. My French toast was a little on the soggy side."}
{"text":"Snooze is best if you get there before 8:30am. They are one of the breakfast places that got it right for seating - outdoor seating in the front & back plus indoor. Wait time isn't so bad. We each had the duo eggs Benedict. I had both the Benny's - definitely recommend. My husband had the chile verde Benedict - also recommend.   Overall, great/friendly staff, good menu choices and the Bloody Mary mix is good. Maybe someday they'll start rimming the glasses and up the garnish."}
{"text":"Only waited about 15 minutes on a busy Saturday morning because we were willing to sit outside.    Excellent, fresh food which makes the high prices tolerable.    Our favs .... apple juice, bacon, and chiliquilles -- out of this world.  No issues with service or speed.  Very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and think the place is adorable . The hostess has greeted us warmly, the servers are super friendly and helpful and the coffee is delish. Had an omelete, good but a little dry , and the corn beef hash which was super good , this is definately a great addition to town and country center."}
{"text":"A month back some girlfriends and I came in for breakfast we enjoyed our visit. We had to wait a while to be seated and the bloody marys could have been a little better but the service and food was great! A girlfriend picked the multiple types of pancakes and she thoroughly enjoyed all of them. I would recommend this place. They also have a huge breakfast burrito if your really hungry!"}
{"text":"Good food, service is a little slow.  Somewhat pricey.  The variety of pancakes is awesome!"}
{"text":"The Breakfast Pot-Pie is my go to choice when I step foot into this place! You have the option to add or subtract certain veggies/meats which is a plus! Great open setting right in the middle of the ASU campus. If you want great food with an inside or outside setting, I recommend this place for breakfast/brunch!   PS - They serve alcohol & have \"bags\" outside for yourself and others to play!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the lines can be very long. Weekday mornings are better than weekends. Otherwise, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Really good food albeit a bit expensive for what you get depending on what you order sometimes. This is a nice place to come for breakfast or brunch. I would recommended it if you have been thinking about trying it sometime. Just make sure you get here early as it has always been incredibly busy whenever I come here."}
{"text":"Decor: A  Food:C+ Service: B+   I had been hearing positive things about Snooze for a while, so I thought it was time to give the place a try. My friend and I arrived there at 1:30ish on a Sunday afternoon, about an hour before closing so we were sat immediately. Service was prompt and friendly, no complaints there. I immediately noticed the fun decor they used for the inside, I really enjoyed the retro/60s vibe they had going on. They had a fairly wide selection on their menu, which I appreciated, there were vegan/ gluten free option.s The food came out at an average speed, I got the corned beef hash, my friend had pancakes of sorts. I was fairly unimpressed by the corned beef hash, it was fairly unoriginal. The beef was masked by the potatoes, and the portion was super small. My friend raved about her pancakes though, so they were able to make up for it there. I would return, but I definitely wouldn't order the hash again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in downtown Gilbert if you like to drink in the morning! The corn beef hash is amazing, as are the bloody's."}
{"text":"Snooze made my day! Right after they opened I ate outdoors.  The atmosphere, music  and view if the mountain were perfect. I had the choose two Benedict option and I had one Benny Goodman and one with the shredded  pork and green chili. The sausage Patty had an awesome brown crust and great flavor. The hash browns were perfect , I requested them crispy and they had just a touch of spice/heat. I found the all of my food to be seasoned just right.  Gloria was our server and she was super attentive, was happy to share her knowledge and had great suggestions.  I will be back again tomorrow to do it again!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great place for brunch, lunch and light drinking! A friend recommended this place for brunch after we hiked Squaw Peak Trail and it was the perfect fit after a hot day of hiking. The restaurant itself is very trendy and quite popular so I suggest getting there early to avoid the brunch and lunch rush.   I wanted a meal that was not too heavy yet still filled me up so I chose \"3 Eggs Any Style.\" It comes with 3 eggs that are cooked however you want them, a fistful of seasoned hashbrowns and a wide variety of bread to choose from for toast. Although the meal I had was simple, it was absolutely delicious and the hashbrowns are what sold me on this place as a whole. The hashbrowns are already seasoned to perfection (in my opinion at least) and are crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.   Other than some of the items on the menu being a little overpriced, I give this place 2 thumbs up and I definitely see this place becoming my new breakfast/brunch spot!"}
{"text":"I went with some old high school friends to catch up and enjoy some brunch. It had just recently opened so it was insanely packed, so it took about 40 min just to get a seat! I got the breakfast burrito, and it was enormous! It could probably feed a small village for a meal. The burrito itself was just your standard affair of breakfast ingredients with a southwestern twist of beans, pico de gallo, and green chile sauce. I had a bite of my friend's order of sweet potato pancakes, and let me tell you, those suckers were rich! I definitely don't think I could have finished it if I had ordered them myself, but they were absolutely delicious.  Overall, the portions were huge (even by American standards), the decor and atmosphere was trendy yet homey, and the staff was very friendly. I would definitely go again for my brunch fix."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is so so so so so yummy...and there's a line out the door for it on the weekends that I just can't force myself to stand in, otherwise I'd be there more often! I had one of the eggs bennie and one of their dessert-like pancakes. So delicious. Great for kids. Love the booths!"}
{"text":"I make sure to visit Snooze when I'm in Tempe.  Always great service and food.  Love having a lot of gluten free options.  Everyone in our party shared pancakes and everyone agreed they were hands down the best pancakes ever.  Grilled cheese and tomato soup was another favorite. Cannot wait to visit again soon."}
{"text":"Wait times are normally long, but worth the wait. I had an amazing breakfast sandwich here! I will be returning again very soon. Employees are so nice and polite. Even very welcoming of dogs on the patio. I had a great experience at this location and will definitely return again and again!"}
{"text":"Traveling for work (alone) so I avoided the long wait by sitting at the counter. Food was decent. Prices were reasonable. Service? Well, if two pretty girls hadn't sat next to me I might have gotten some attention. I wasn't asked if it was my first time there, wasn't offered the specials, and had to ask Steve for a place-setting. Had to wait for my check after leaving my credit card on the counter for nearly 10 minutes. He's capable of good service because he even gave these girls free pancakes! You'd think I was chopped liver or had a face covered in warts by how few times he even looked at me. Don't sit in his section and your experience might be better."}
{"text":"Snooze has a pretty trendy atmosphere overall. Well decorated with a light and bright feel throughout. It's located basically on ASU campus. I came in on a Sunday afternoon and they told me it was going to be a 45 minute wait and considering the area, I'm sure that's pretty typical. The good news is it only ended up being a 20 minute wait. Not much seating in the tiny waiting area but I was lucky enough to snag a chair. Free wifi that you don't need a code for, and I thought it was cool that they text you when your table is ready so you don't have to sit there and wait for your name to be called or carry around one of those weird little things that vibrate.   We sat outside and even though it was like 98 degrees, sitting under the umbrella was surprisingly not that hot. I ordered the Sandwich I Am with a Pineapple Upside Down Pancake.  Everything was FANTASTIC. The pancake was unbelievably tasty. Might sound stupid but it tasted exactly like...you guessed it...pineapple upside down cake! The consistency was perfect and the cinnamon butter on top was delicious. My Sandwich I Am was sort of like a McDonald's sausage and egg biscuit but with real ingredients, and I mean that in a good way. Loved the pretzel bread bun. The hash browns were on point too.   I've gotta comment on our server, Jenna. She was awesome. Super friendly, gave thoughtful recommendations, all around great customer service. She even hooked it up with her favorite pancake since we're out of towners and don't have the pleasure of experiencing Snooze whenever we please. Super cool.   I'm legitimately salty that I don't live here and probably won't be able to visit Snooze AM again for quite some time. Keep it up y'all!  Here's my overall ratings: Atmosphere- 4/5 Quality/value- 4.5/5 Food- 4.5/5 Service- 4.5/5 Coffee- 4/5"}
{"text":"The pineapple upside down pancake is delicious!  The service was fantastic.  I love that they sent out a sample to try.. Good iced tea is always a bonus.  I will come back next time I visit the area!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good pancake spot so I invited some friends to join me at Snooze for early breakfast. As a newer location, the d√©cor resembled their other restaurants. The signatory yellow light fixtures corresponded with a good number of round tables. The structure also facilitated a row of stools facing the large windows, and a full bar in the back. By extension, the sidewalk patio added character and spaciousness to the restaurant. Fortunately, we arrived early enough and did not have to wait for a table.  The Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup ($7.50) came with a conventional bread and cheese sandwich, tomato soup, and hash brown. There was a light crunch on the bread, but not enough cheese to translate into that gooey experience I was looking for. For the price, I was expecting better value and taste on the sandwich. The tomato soup was rich, hearty, and had a slight kick in the end. The hash brown was soft and needed more crispy edges. It was not the best grilled cheese, but it did hit the spot.  The Pancake Flight ($9) came with our choice of blueberry pancake, sweet potato pancake, and the chocolate ganache pancake. All three of us agreed the sweet potato pancake was the most impressive, as the buttermilk and caramel flavors accompanied a touch of ginger butter and handfuls of pecans tossed on top. The server endorsed the blueberry pancake, but it tasted rather conventional. I wished there were wholesome blueberries embedded, and that these pancakes were easier to cut into. The dark chocolate ganache concoction was without depth and the least impressive.  Service was very sporadic and not warm or welcoming as I expected of breakfast places. Overall, the food were nowhere close to the experience I previously had at their sister restaurants. The food hit the spot but there was no wow factor whatsoever. Additionally, I thought the execution on the Grilled Cheese was very poor for the price and a restaurant of this caliber. The server also gave approval to a blueberry pancake that was rather sub par. Overhyped. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Two words: Da Bomb. Food: incredible! I had the corned beef hash, eggs, and flour tortillas  with a half order of French toast. Amazing! The hash was made with REAL corned beef. Not totally the canned salty stuff. It was cooked to perfection.  Service: totally awesome. Not one discrepancy from any of the folks working there. Truly a happy crew that pulls as a team. Loved the place. Will definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this morning. I was meeting a friend with a baby so I went 25 mins before we were to meet so that she didn't have to  (I had seen in reviews that Saturday mornings were terribly crowded). I arrived about 8:40am and had a table by 8:45! I was so surprised. I told the hostess my plan and they went ahead and seated me anyway. The staff was great and the food was really tasty. I had the breakfast tacos. They were really good but I didn't finish just because I had gotten full from the pancake flight we shared.   The retro decor is also super cute. I can't wait to go back on a day I don't have to work. Mimosas!!!"}
{"text":"WOW!   Pretty much one of the best breakfast places I have encountered in recent years.  Clean, cheerful atmosphere.  Great music.  Outstanding Service.  But most of all........the single best order of Bacon, yes, Bacon, I have ever had in a restaurant -- bar none.  Most pre-cook it, and toss it on the grill for a few seconds.  Others, and this is outright sacrilege, deep fry it..........But this is a place we will return to again and again."}
{"text":"Wonderful way to wake up!  Eat here for delicious breakfast finds not same old tired egg dishes."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite breakfast joints on Gilbert, Snooze delivers! I especially like the Bloody Mary options here, they're made very well and always consistent. The outdoor patio area is also a very nice touch when you are brunching and boozing with friends. The food here is exceptional as well as the friendly service."}
{"text":"I come to snooze often with my husband and father in law  on the weekends. Although there is usually a wait it is well worth it because the food is always good and staff is amazing. This past Sunday we were there and our server was Alyssa. My FIL asked Alyssa what the best French toast was (thinking he could get any of them because they have gluten free bread- he has celiac) and she says the Drunk'n Monkey. Quickly she realized it was made with banana bread and couldn't be done gluten free. Now I bet if you are reading this you think I'm going to complain but you are so wrong. She made another recommendation (the OMG French toast) and everything was great. Before our breakfast came out she brought an apology pancake (the gluten free blueberry Danish I think) and it was delicious and my FIL loved it. It truly is the little things like that when you are dining out that make your experience so much better. My husband and I got two things and split, we had the cinnamon roll pancake (which I dream about, it is seasonal and not on menu but they will still make it for you if you ask) and a breakfast scramble which were both delicious. We are probably going to ask for Alyssa next time we come, she was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Hands down best breakfast/brunch experience I've ever had. The food is phenomenal and the staff is warm and welcoming. I've eaten at this snooze location several t mes with friends and even when I went to sit at the bar by myself I felt as though I was sitting in a friends home. I love love love love snooze and the snooze family.  Whether you're craving savory or sweet I guarantee they have what you need to motivate you to quit hitting the snooze button and try out snooze."}
{"text":"Breakfast Cocktails!!  Great laid back atmosphere here. They play up to date music and reggae, which gives the place positive vibes. My waiter was excellent & very friendly. I came on  Friday morning and it was pretty packed. I had to wait about 15 mins for a table for one , since the bar area was also full. I ordered the Mountain Mule cocktail. It was light and refreshing. You could tell there were fresh ingredients used. I didnt even taste the alcohol!   I ordered the breakfast pot pie. It was really tasty. The sausage gravy has a nice hint of herbs, and just the right consistency. The crust was phyllo dough and it was nice & flaky. I did have to send my entree back due to it being on the cold side, but that was a quick fix and worth the wait. I hope they bring this to Vegas.. it would be perfect for those needing to recoup from partying the night before on the strip!"}
{"text":"Had the best experience this morning at snooze. Our server Liz was incredible. She really made the whole experience that much better, not to mention the food is incredible. Thanks Liz!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and they were so delicious! My only complaint is that the service was pretty slow even though they weren't packed. I will definitely return here again though!"}
{"text":"Standard breakfast food, but it was great to have such a great selection of it. Modern takes at comfort food side by side the good old standard breakfast picks. My husband loved their bloody so much he is still talking about it months later."}
{"text":"I love Snooze I have been to the main location in Phoenix and to the one in Tempe I was apprehensive to try the Gilbert one since it just opened and probably needed some time to work out any glitches that any new restaurant would come across. I came in right before closing they seated us immediately. The waitress was sweet and kind, the food was very good and comparable to the other locations with one exception - the hash-browns. I don't know what went wrong there but they were not good and that's normally my favorite part. They were dry and unpleasant. Everything else though was perfect. I don't understand the complaints on time - do not try to come here on a Saturday or Sunday morning and expect to be seating within 20/30 minutes. It's a very popular restaurant and it's rather small space for interior seating. I highly recommend just not at a high volume time."}
{"text":"I see why there is a 45 minute wait!  I had the pot pie and it was great with creamy sausage gravy on it.  Nice amounts of sausage with the flaky crust (not sure how it stayed flaky the whole time!)   Service was excellent, attentive, and quick. Even though we had to wait, they apologized for the delay though we expected it considering how many people there were. All in all a great experience with good unique food!    Be aware that the menu is limited and doesn't offer all things typical at a breakfast place, such as skillets, but you can customize to your hearts content.  If you are waiting, go hang out in the back of the restaurant. They will text you when your table is almost ready.  You can also go hang out at Whole Foods or Trader Joe's."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for new breakfast places. I've been all over the valley trying different places and this one is neck and neck with one of my favorites. My wife is very picky and never clears her plate and here she cleared hers and ate some of mine! The patio is nice and the service was pretty good. I would say the food is what I would come here for, not so much the service. Not saying it was bad but the food is amazing. My only complaint was that it took almost 10 minutes for my latte but in their defense it was extremely busy. I recommend the OMG! French toast. It's not too sweet and filling but not to the point where I want to fall asleep in my chair.  I had some of my wife's hashbrowns and next time I'll be getting a side of those too!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot, but today was a little disappointing. We like to go here between 7-8 when it's not crazy busy. Today we went at 7:30 lots of open tables & booths. 1. Know you clientele ( older customers might prefer a booth)  my wife and I share a meal almost all the time. We have our favorites here, but we strayed away and tried some thing new. The chili verde benny. The pulled pork was almost non existent  and what was there was fatty and not appealing. The corn tortillas were under cooked and cheese was not to be found. The poached eggs & hash browns were good as was the Hollandaise sauce, pico de gallo was also minimal. The side of bacon was not up to Snooze caliber. ( smaller than normal portion) Every visit before has been an easy 4-5 stars  this visit was about 2 1/2 stars but I gave it 3. Snooze don't start slipping. I can't remember our servers name she was very nice but on our check it said Clore Dog  very confusing. Also one of the male servers standing out in the open eating and the he went an sat in the corner by his self."}
{"text":"So I ate here this past weekend and it was okay. Maybe I should have ordered something different. Service was very attentive and sweet. It gets extremely packed so your best bet is to get here early or sit at the bar which is not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  It took me forever to decide what to order because everything looked amazing.   I got the Benny duo.  Two different types of eggs Benedict.  Delicious.  My wife got the peach cobbler pancakes.  They were huge and tasted like cake.  We will definitely be coming back again and again.   This is the best breakfast I've had."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. They allow substitutions and have healthy options! The period are also pretty large. I would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"I had never been to Phoenix before and I tried Snooze for breakfast. A great menu with vegetarian options. Outdoor seating, trendy atmosphere near college. Service was friendly, food great and the special mimosa hit the spot !"}
{"text":"Been to a Snooze establishment before and loved it so much that I thought I'd try out the Gilbert location.  Absolutely terrible. We were seated pretty quickly as it was a slow weekday morning. However, our waitress completely neglected us (a party of two). The waitress' friends were seated next to us and were given all the service. Not to mention, the entire staff kept on making rounds to check on their friends... I'm guessing a previous employee here? Anyway. They got their drinks before we did and we were never checked on for refills. Such crap service which sucks because the food is so good.  Also, if you don't get a booth, you get a small table that's pretty close distance to the next table over. Usually not a problem. However with all the staff constantly checking on their friend, we had butts in our faces for the duration of our time there. Lol not cool."}
{"text":"Outstanding coffee. Delicious food. Extremely good service. Busy Friday morning but server made time to recommend her favorites and refill our table's iced tea and coffee. Halfway through a delicious breakfast of lox, goat cheese and cress, a server brought over a pancake. On the house. Pineapple Upside Downcake. Readers, this was properly amazing. Not too sweet, but the right combo of rich and fruity. Seriously, possibly the best pancake we've ever had (and not made, either)."}
{"text":"I literally took two bites on the drinkin monkey French toast and decided to write a review. It's so amazing that I might just buy other one to take home with me. If you had not eaten here before I highly suggest Juans tacos and the drunkin monkey French toast!! I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"It just happens that we've eaten here twice in the last month or so, and I have to say that we love this place. The vibe is quintessential college-town hip, and the food is fresh and delicious, made with care and quality ingredients. The service has been very good, with a large staff that is always eager to please. Our breakfast choices have been shrimp & grits, corned beef hash & eggs, a breakfast burrito, and huevos rancheros. Every one has been excellent. If we're ever in the area again, this is our go to spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"After waiting for a brief time  -- and enjoying coffee outside and people watching -- we were expecting a good experience!  Not to be! the poached eggs were so \"vinegary\" -- they were uneatable!  The muffins for the eggs Benedict were saturated w/ the water from the eggs -- unappetizing! Truly disappointed w/ the noise level -- could not converse w/ table mates or server w/o shouting!  We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Let me make this very very clear:  This is the BEST food you will ever have in your life.  Ok, now that we have that established...let me take some time to convince you as to why.  The Pineapple upside down pancakes are so good that every other pancake for the rest of your life will be dry and tasteless in comparison. Unless of course you can convince the chef to make you coffee and donut pancakes. Also FREAKING amazing.  The sandwich I am, three egg scramble, upstream benny (or ANY of the benny's for that matter) are slap yo mama good.  Oh and the best part? A Colorado based company!! When I moved from Denver a couple of years ago, I was devestated (no, but really, I was) that I wouldn't get to make my regular weekend stop into Snooze. And lo and behold, they came to Arizona! This is the second location in the valley. The other location is off of 20th and Camelback.  Just a side note, the wait times can be a little long, but I GUARANTEE that every minute is worth it when you take your first bite. Guarantee it."}
{"text":"Hallelujah, Snooze has come to Phoenix!!!!  As a Denver native, I can only hope to describe to you non-Denverites the culture of Snooze. It has made all other breakfast places seem dismal. The quality of food is astounding, the atmosphere is upbeat and trendy and the servers are the friendliest, hippest people you will ever meet. You will never wait less tan an hour for a table, but the wait has always been worth it.  Snooze Phoenix is no different. They have captured the essence of the hipster vibe of Denver and brought it to the valley quite nicely.  The food, again will never disappoint. If you've never been, here are my suggestions:  Always ask what the pancake of the day is. Always.  Sweet: Pancake Flight with a Pineapple Upside Down Pancake, the Pancake of the Day and a Cinnamon Roll pancake.  Savory: 3 Egg Scramble with hollandaise, avocado and pico de gallo and corn tortillas.  There is nothing but love in my heart for Snooze. Now, Snooze, please get your booties out to Orange County next!!!"}
{"text":"So yummy!! 2nd time here and not disappointed! Lox Benedict and Bella Benedict did  not disappoint! Peanut butter pancake....worth the calories!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for brekkie. A Little bit of a wait which is why they lost one star. I like how you can get two different Benedicts and different pancakes on the same plate. The menu is unique and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"I love cute, hip breakfast places and snooze is definitely working in bring a cute hip breakfast spot, even if it's not quite there yet.   Cool decor. Awesome patio and open-air bar seating.  Good selection of mimosas and bloody Mary's ($6-8 each).  Food looked good, even though we didn't order anything.  Good location at the old Town and country mall, but I wish it were closer to central.  Staff was friendly, but definitely still working out the kinks. We had quite a wait for two mimosas and a beer.  Overall, I'm giving Snooze the benefit if the doubt and I will definitely be back to sample the menu.   Ps, I don't know if it will ever make it to five star status since it's part if a CA/CO chain."}
{"text":"Between the fun and the food, relaxed atmosphere you could ask for a better way to start a Saturday morning!  The games to keep the kids and adults occupied while waiting for breakfast to arrive makes the time fly and enjoyable!  The food was very good, I had the Verde Benedict and Ashley the breakfast pot pie.  The kids really enjoyed their hot chocolates and kid breakfasts!"}
{"text":"I have only been to this fabulous establishment twice and I love the service and the food !! I have to give a shout out to my wonderful hostess Heather .. she was very attentive and super sweet !! This is why I will return to this great place .."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Gluten free toast was good and the hash browns are delicious. It's really loud inside. Too loud for my preference in the morning. Good experience overall though."}
{"text":"Went here for a brunch date with a close friend...it was a 20 minute wait but totally worth it!  Any place that offers beer for breakfast is number one in my book!! Get the brewmosa and you wont be sorry!   Ordered the Chilaquiles Benedict and I never wanted it to end! It was heaven in my mouth!  Service was good and the atmosphere great. I loved the mix of music they had going on and it wasnt too loud or too quiet!   Definitely will be back to try some stuffed french toast and a Palomosa!"}
{"text":"This is straight up the best breakfast find of the century!  The menu looks so damn good I almost ate it!!  Seriously the pancakes are the best in the world and the Bfast tacos are legit with flavor, hash browns are delectable!"}
{"text":"Looking for your stereotypical brunch place after a morning run, we stumbled up Snooze AM (thanks to Yelp). Bright, cheery, and clean, it's what you'd expect from an upscale brunch chain.   Coffee was great and refills plentiful. Plenty of options, savory and sweet. The omelets were done well, and the hashbrowns were...unique. In a good way. Portions weren't grossly large, which I actually appreciate in a restaurant. Quality, not quantity.  Server was a bit of a space cadet and service was pretty slow, but it may have been a one-off, so I can't knock the place for that."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I dined her frequently when they first opened, but the quality of the good and the service rapidly declined. Such a disappointment. I'll choose Luci's any day."}
{"text":"I went to Snooze several months ago, around when it first opened. I totally spaced on writing a review. D'oh! But I remember everything so well, I'll just go ahead and write one anyway. 4 months later. Gonna be super accurate.  I went here with 2 other friends of mine during peak brunch hour. i.e., when yo' ass rolls out of bed on a Saturday around 10:30AM. It was pretty crowded, but we only ended up waiting about 20 minutes or so. I just stood outside and snapped pictures of their awesome sign. Such pretty typography + signage (insert nerdy laugh-snort). Once inside and seated, I became increasingly impressed by their fantastic brand consistency. Everything felt so...cool and retro. What the Hell guys, why didn't you hire me as your graphic designer!? I would've traded my work for food. Anyway, our orders were promptly taken by extremely friendly staff. It DID take an overly long time for our food to arrive, but they hadn't been open very long and it was ridiculously busy, so I wasn't too surprised by that. Once the food came, I snarfed it down and washed food particles away with some delicious mimosas. I don't have a massive appetite usually, but I felt their dishes were perfectly proportionate. Just enough food to fill you up, but not too much to put you into a brunch food coma for the rest of the afternoon. I wish I could recall exactly what I ate, but I'm writing this review 4 months later, so my memory is a bit wonky. Oh, remember a few sentences ago when I said our food took a while to arrive? They felt the need to make up for that by gifting us a free pancake that tasted like A FREAKIN' SAMOA. Yeah, I forgive you. Like immediately. Overall, everything was really tasty and appropriately priced. Staff was genuinely kind and really easy to interact with. It gave me the opportunity to crack a bunch of cheesy jokes with our server.   I haven't been back since, mostly because I just eat a banana for breakfast when I wake up in the morning. But next time I get HONGRAY for some brunch, I'll definitely hit this place up. Plus, I can ride my bicycle there! Wow dude!  bye"}
{"text":"I was hungry for pancakes but decided against them. They have all sweet toppings, soI chose the Bella Bella Benny hollandaise instead. It was good though wary since the meat was prosciutto.  Other party members had the Ham Benedict III and Juan's Breakfast Tacos.  We arrived early at 9:15 amenity a 30 minute wait, we were told. The wait was much longer and they lost new business  and the restaurant next door received those customers. There is complementary coffee while you wait which is a major plus!    The food was very tasty and we'd definitely return! I had the option to substitute pancakes for the hash browns for a $3.50 surcharge. That's quite a hefty substitute fee!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this restaurant. They have a community table, bright colors, friendly staff and excellent food. The only downfall i'd say is the pancakes are a little to thick for my liking but the flavor was pretty good. We will be back"}
{"text":"Great service and a cool environment...  BUT,  - the food is a little pricey, especially for simple breakfast food. - food was warm, but definitely not as hot as I would like my eggs Benedict. (Pretty luke warm to be honest) - did the pancake flight, flavor of the day was so gross neither my guest or I finished.  (Also pretty dry, not quite pizza crust dry but almost there.)  Wouldn't recommend going out of your way to go here for breakfast.  However, if you go try the pineapple upside down cake pancakes. They were the least dry I tried while here!  Will not be coming back, but did not have a terrible experience here."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food. Got the Snooze Spuds (a plate of hashbrowns and cheese with your choice of add-ins) and the daily Banana Fosters pancake on the side. I didn't realize the pancake would be so HUGE! But everything was really good and the service was great. Go with a hearty appetite if you want to try more than one thing."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I had the pancake flight and my husband had the corned beef hash. This is by far one of the best breakfasts we have had during our time in the Phoenix area!  I didn't realize it when I found them on yelp, but was delighted to find out that this place also has locations in SanDiego, and was the same place I had raved to my friends and family about when I got back from visiting there. If you are around this area, visit this restaurant!  AMAZING food!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other one in Gilbert, but this one is quite a different feel. I think it might habe to do with the location being on ASU's campus, so it's a bit \"collegey\". The decor is cute and classy but it definitely caters more to a college scene.  My friend at for breakfast at 8am and it was about 80% occupied for the indoor seating. No one was out on the patio seating area as yet because it was a tad too chilly still. By the time we left though, the line was out the door onto the sidewalk at almost 10am.  I ordered the Benny duo (one of each type of eggs benedict) with the Bella! Bella! Benny and the Chili Verde Benedict with pulled pork. So the chili sauced tortilla that they had as the \"bread\" for the Chili Verde Benedict was very different, but I wasn't too sold on it. It might be the texture or the corn tortilla flavor overpowering the rest of the benedict... it wasn't a hit for me. The hollandaise, egg and pulled pork though were pretty good. For the Bella! Bella! Benny, the slice of ciabata bread it came on was so thin and just underwhelming. The prosciutto, egg and hollandaise sauce again were spot on. But with how salty prosciutto is, I felt like there should be a more hearty piece/type of bread to balance out that natural saltiness of the prosciutto.   The meal came with hash browns which to me was the only perfect (for me) item on my plate. The outside brown and crisp on the outside, moist and cooked just right on the inside. My other complaint is that they neither have blue cheese dressing nor ranch dressing/dipping sauce, and those are my sauces of choice for potatoes (I don'tlike ketchup).  Another thing is Snooze changes their menu, but it always has a lot of similarities to the one before. It's like they remix items that are on the menu. They have a lot of great ideas and sometimes they're great (like their fall menu was) and sometimes they fall short - like the current menu."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of Snooze, the great attitude of the hospitality staff, the food and music. I will come here as often as I get back into town."}
{"text":"Gravy was way to salty, coffee was weak. Great location though. Blah blah blah blah review review review review review"}
{"text":"I like to try out the pancakes of the day ussually really good"}
{"text":"Good service with bad food except the smoked ham it's delicious.  Coffee was week a brewing problem. Tables were dirty and the menu was grimy."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Basic. Alright.  Please save your appetite and time - go to the location in Tempe/Scottsdale. We made plans to spend our afternoon brunch sitting down at one of our favorite restaurants. Instead of going to our typical locations we decided to switch it up and try the location in Gilbert.  The service was unfortunately inattentive. After receiving our food we literally lost our server and the server assistant for 10 minutes. We ended up getting up to ask the bartender for condiments.  Food was mediocre - the food was thrown on to the plate and the overall look of our dishes was unappealing. I don't know how the same restaurant and the same dish could possibly tasted so different from other times we've eaten at Snooze but it did.  I ordered the hash brown and chorizo meal. While he order the benny duo combination along with a side of peanut butter and chip pancakes.  Just save your money and go to the other locations. They have more attentive staff and put more effort into their meals."}
{"text":"I love Snooze and my brother and I had been planning to go here all week when I came to visit. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that they sent out an omelette when I'd ordered a scramble and had to wait about 10 min to get the correct order. Otherwise the food was delicious (albeit a cold pancake that sat while I waited for the rest of the food to come out).  I always get the pineapple upside down pancake (gluten-free). It's the best pancake they have IMO. Also (eventually) got the egg scramble with goat cheese, spinach and mushrooms. I could have done without the hashbrowns. I tried just get the pancake instead of the toast and hashbrowns which I think is a fair trade out, but apparently you have to pay an additional $4 for the pancake whether you want to trade out both or just one of them (which doesn't make sense to me, but oh well).  Their lattes are good. I asked for a latte with almond milk and a little honey and cinnamon. It was delicious."}
{"text":"best breakfast I've had in a long, long time.   what I love about this place is how customizable it is. the menu encourages you to get creative. don't worry about messing up a combination, because it's darn near impossible to go wrong here!  this was my first time experiencing a \"pancake flight\" and let me tell you - I hope it's not my last. pancakes were really unique, e.g. pineapple upside down cake, blueberry danish, sweet potato, etc. pineapple was my favorite.   they have almond milk, which is always a plus.   friendly wait staff, despite being crazy busy on super bowl sunday AM.   I will definitely be back here next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I went to the one in Boulder back in October and couldn't wait for this one at the Town and Country shopping center to open.   Being a vegan, I loved that they had options to make my breakfast without meat/dairy. While my husband loved that he could have whatever his meatlover heart desired. I have had the tofu scramble with the soyrizo which is delicious! My husband loves the sausage. The pancake of the day when we were there the first time was a sticky bun pancake, we ordered one for the table as dessert and I had a couple bites, it was heaven!   There is usually a wait, even during the week. But they will text you when your table is ready and you can go shopping at Nordstrom Rack right next door or take advantage of the games they have on their patio. They also have Bloody Mary's and mimosas, and great coffee. I know I'll be back! I love a good breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"I'm loving all the new restaurants that are opening in Tempe and Snooze is no exception!  My boyfriend and I visited for breakfast and it wasn't too busy so we were seated right away - it's a pretty big place. We opted for seats at the counter by the window so we could stare outside (and we had a good view of the ping pong table, which was entertaining.)  I ordered the late harvest benny which is sweet potato polenta topped with more sweet potatoes, eggs, fennel and kale and served with hashbrowns. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast pot pie. We both really enjoyed our choices. I love the combination of the sweet potato polenta with the eggs paired with the hashbrowns. Plus, the cream cheese hollandaise gave a nice sweet balance to this savory dish. All mixed together it made for a tasty breakfast hash. And it was very filling.  Overall I really liked the atmosphere, the service was good and the food was yummy. It will be great to go here when it's nice enough to open up the large windows."}
{"text":"We first tried this restaurant in Denver and gave it 5 stars. While visiting ASU, we were ecstatic to find a location on campus. We placed our name on the list and were told it was about an hour and fifteen minute wait.    We weren't deterred because if it was good as Denver, it would be worth the wait.  We returned from walking around the campus in the estimated time and were seated shortly after.  As with Denver, the wait was worth it.  Friendly staff and great food! The French toast is a must try and is our favorite."}
{"text":"Snooze! How amazing you are!  Lines are long but food is worth it.  Hopefully you can catch one of the communal tables and skip the wait.   Food was phenomenal! All. Of. It!    We had the OMG French Toast, Scramble, with the pancake of the day (Smores) and a couple Mimosas.  The OMG French Toast was stupid good! Everything you hear and more.  The pancake was on the same level. The Scramble was good but took a major back seat to the other items.  Service was solid too.  We had a really good sever.  Philip was his name.  He was very efficient, very nice and gave solid recommendations.  For as busy as they were he did an amazing job holding down all of his tables.   The place has a great vibe to it, busy and bustling but stayed clean and under control.    You get a bang for your buck for sure.  You pay for good food but you aren't giving an arm or a leg."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service.  Not too busy mid-morning on a Friday.  I opted for a \"lighter\" breakfast with the egg white scramble and was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for a weekday brunch. I bet it can get busy on weekends. It seems like a fun place to hang out with a ping pong table and a good amount of seating. The menu makes it hard to choose because everything looks delicious. We ended up going with the best choice for two people who can't make a decision because they allow you to mix and match pancakes to make a meal and do half and half with different kinds of eggs benedict. The food was so good and it was awesome to be able to try 5 different menu items between the two of us.  The coffee wasn't the best but they do serve it with fresh cream which always steps it up."}
{"text":"Wait gets pretty aggressive so be prepared. Breakfast is good. If you have a sweet tooth their pancakes are delicious and creative. Would come back if I can get in quickly."}
{"text":"I've experienced about ten breakfasts at Snooze. One I brought my 18 yo niece and she said, \"best pancakes ever\". Today my 51 yo wife just got the pancake flight and happily exclaimed repeatedly, \" best breakfast ever \".  For those of you who enjoy the details, Snooze pays attention to all the details to create a gourmet breakfast dining experience. Excellent, fresh squeezed juices, high end coffee, upgraded ingredients, resulting in a very beautiful way to start the day."}
{"text":"Went here recently for the first time and I. Will. Be. Back! Loved my waitress and the positive, energetic vibes! The food was FANTASTIC! Portion sizes made me forget about portion control, haha!  The drinks are awesome and well thought out as well... I never thought to have tequila with breakfast until i came here and it was worth it!  My group had a blast and loved the service and food! 10/10 would recommend. It's worth the wait on a busy day!"}
{"text":"Went to snooze for the second time Friday (first at this location). I was told our wait would be 20-25 minutes, but only took 15. The staff were friendly and attentive, and my meal was perfect."}
{"text":"We were in downtown Gilbert for the Art Walk. My wife Susan is a painter and had some wonderful mini paintings for sale at the GAL booth. Afterwords, by happy accident, we ended up at Snooze (thought we were at Joyride Taco lol). Sat on the very nice back patio. Had a wonderful server Catlynn. Both of us had eggs benedict, Susan had the Chilaquiles  and I had the Bella Bella. Both were delicious. Had fun talking with Catlynn about the \"accident\". Very good experience overall."}
{"text":"Every experience is a good one.  The food is amazing.  The restaurant is quaint.  Can be a bit noisy because of the openness, but is still a great place for good food.  Highly recommend the pancakes.  Mostly, just sit back, relax and enjoy."}
{"text":"This breakfast was probably top 5 breakfasts of my life- the food was outstanding....the creativity and variety of breakfast foods and not to mention DRINKS! Yes, like alcoholic breakfast drinks. They have a full bar in there too! They have such unique egg benedicts and if you can't decide (like me) they have the Benny Duo which u can pick 2 different eggs Benedict- super clever. AND a pancake flight because we also couldn't all decide on the pancakes which were AHmazing. Our server Charles was on point, super friendly and just on it lol probably one of the better servers I have come across in a long while too! Great experience at Snooze, I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"5 million stars for this cute little place ! I had the drunken punken pancakes $7.50 the pannycakes were as big as the plate . The pumpkin pie spice was strong & proud , mixed with the velvety cream cheese .. This was a definite party on a plate  coffee was great and served with real cream . I can't wait to come back and try one of the Benedict items"}
{"text":"I tried their flight of pineapple, sweet potato, pumpkin! Their pancakes are definitely unique and all other breakfast items looks pretty good. The service was good even it was very busy in morning. I would like to re-visit this place."}
{"text":"I've been here on 4 separate occasions and all 4 times, the service and wait time to receive my drink or food was outrageous. I would never dine here just based on the fact that an omelet should never take 45 minutes to get. On a positive note, the back patio is inviting and has activities for the kids to be entertained with. Too bad the service was so slow."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast place in Phoenix by far. Responsibly sourced ingredients, fantastic friendly wait staff, and consistently excellent food. Never had an \"off day\" here. Modern retro decor and this place is always buzzing. Always a wait to get in on the weekends because everyone knows how great it is, totally worth it. I don't even blink if they say it going to be 45 mins or more, although usually we get in quicker than they estimate. This is THE place we bring our out of town guests for breakfast and it always impresses. I'm currently on a Spuds Deluxe kick but I also enjoy the Sandwich I Am, breakfast burrito is also excellent and my girlfriend is always thinking about the sweet potato pancake."}
{"text":"Date of Visit 8/5 7:30am approx  I love this place.  The chocolate chip pancakes were delicious.  The music playing reminded me of the late 1990s early 2000s when I was still in middle school/high school.  The servers were fantastic.  I ate chocolate chip pancakes with homemade chicken sausage.  This place is so good I plan to return on Sunday.  Date of Return Visit 8/9 12pm approx.  Note: If you want to come here, avoid Sunday midday.  Come earlier in the day, or come during a weekday.  I went & they said 45-60 minutes waiting for a table.  Since I was in a chess tournament & could not afford to wait that long for food, I opted to order takeout instead.  The takeout option was worth it - I loved the breakfast I had - their sausage was good, the upside down pineapple pancakes were good, & I enjoyed their hot chocolate.  I recommend coming here during non-peak visiting hours, & ordering food to go during peak visiting hours."}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet friends for breakfast but be aware there is always a wait.  Get there when they open on weekends for the least resistance.  The food is good and so is the service.  There is gratis coffee while you wait near the fountain for a table.   I have not had a negative experience here yet."}
{"text":"I don't wait in line for food - EVER, and this place always has a line. When a colleague suggested we meet at Snooze for a breakfast meeting I cringed. I reluctantly went and was thrilled there was a table open when I arrived. The restaurant gods were smiling on me. Obviously the place is popular and I can see why. The service was great. Our waitress was friendly, always ready to refresh coffee, making sure everything was OK. Not overbearing, just enough to feel taken care of. Now, I already had breakfast so just had coffee, other people ordered and they loved their food. The breakfast burrito was popular. It looked massive and not a single person was able to finish it, not because it was bad, but because of the size of the burrito. People seemed happy. Now, the burrito didn't come with any breakfast fluff on the side. You ordered the burrito and that is all that came, but it was ample. Next time I'll eat, but still won't wait in line."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Snooze AM for awhile now and I'm ready to write a review. I will say this, sometimes I get a four star experience (food is good and service is helpful and prompt) while during other visits the experience is one star or less (food is good but service is horrible [non existent] and very slow).  When I visit during the week, the service is great. The servers are helpful and I always have water in my glass (a marker of good service). The food is also usually very prompt. During the weekends, the servers are friendly (when they are there) but they don't come back and sometimes mix up your order.  All in all, the food is always reliably good and often very rich. However, the service can be good or bad depending on the day of the week. I suggest going during the week when there are less people while during the weekend there are long waits and spotty service.  For lack of constituency of experience, I give two stars.  Things I've had: 3 Eggs Any Style (Made my order perfect) Breakfast Pot Pie (very very very rich, lots of cream) Snooze Breakfast Burrito (my favorite, large burrito and the flavor is very universally appealing) Green Eggs 'n Hamwich (Delicious) Sister Fig's French Toast (too sweet) Fall Greens (lovely light meal) House Coffee (not strong coffee) Choice Mimosa(for me YES!)"}
{"text":"Pros: what a cute cute cute place to eat breakfast. Perfect day to eat breakfast on the patio. Good services.   Cons: long wait. Luckily we were able to explore the Trader Joe's and Whole Foods in the same shopping complex."}
{"text":"I love this place! The first time I ate here was in San Diego, and now they have opened one in Gilbert! The closest to me since I live in Tucson! This is all around a perfect brunch place! Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite breakfast joint!  Mimosa glasses....LARGE!  Thank u for that! We started at the bar which was easy to get into because there was a break between chairs in the middle so that people on the wait can get to it easier.  We waited 30mins for a table but this place was well worth the wait. And the drinks are big so they lasted. Friend got a bacon Bloody Mary and was pleased with the flavors The Chilaquiles Benedict was amazing. Hash browns cooked just right! Asked for an expresso martini and they said \"sure! What's in it?\"  I told them.... And it wAs made perfect but not in a martini glass but a glass. And who cares. It was cold and yummy!  Our server Alex (I believe his name was) provided amazing and friendly service"}
{"text":"LOVE Snooze. I had eaten at the San Diego restaurant several times while living there so I was very excited to see it opening up in Gilbert. Food is delicious, service has been great. However, I feel that a mister system is necessary given that the waits are often lengthy. Other than that I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place. It is super chill and relaxing. There is some ping pong and bags if you want something to do. They have a lot of delicious drink options and the food is amazing! The only bummer is sometimes it is very packed and hard to get in"}
{"text":"Writing this review as we sit waiting for the past 15 minutes on our server to take our order,after waiting 35 minutes to be seated. Under the table is a crayon and crushed Pringles from who knows when. On top of that they put us at a table underneath a planter swarming with flies and bees, needless to say I have done the landscaping for them. Will update this post after The meal if the food happens to be better than the service, which is what we have heard. Way to treat a new patron, will not recommend or be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Snore 5 times now, here in Phoenix.  Alright, it's \"Snooze\", not Snore.  But I don't like either names: because if I'm \"snoozing\", why, how would I be at breakfast?  In fact, I think \"BREAK-FAST! Is a better name than Snooze or Snore.  But I digress...my first visit was to a San Diego Snore location. and that visit was fast, friendly and delicious!   And accommodating, everything a great breakfast can and should be.  The last two visits were bad and I think they're moving in the wrong direction.  First of all, the servers are a whole bunch less friendly than the hostesses.  In fact, they're kinda aloof.    Worse is slow: last Sunday, I waited almost 25 minutes from order to delivery and everything on my plate was a different temperature: the toast was hot and delicious, the hash browns and eggs, cold...literally cold.  It was replaced and was delicious.  But I dunno, I think you gotta get that right the first time.    Today, I met a friend, she clearly ordered Corned Beef Hash with scrambled eggs and a pancake.  The eggs and pancake showed up alright and the Corned Beef Hash followed a good 12 minutes later.  Now, I'm not going to pay $15 - each - for breakfast, featuring poorly prepared food with slow, aloof server/service, (who today was not aloof, but was not really in-tune with waiting tables)...and a smiling hostess.  Not worth it.  Last, someone also pointed out something to me that made me take notice: you know how long-time breakfast joints, IHOP, Denny's, Village Inn, they always SMELL like a breakfast joint?  I don't know if it's 15 years of bacon grease, but they DO have that \"breakfasty\" smell, and...well...you don't get any of those aromas at Snooze. Why is that?  No breakfast aroma."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time at a \"Snooze An Am Eatery\". My first time was at a location in Houston as this time Tempe! Both experiences were great.   This location is clean and fast! We did have to wait 1.5 hours for our table (Saturday at 10:30am, prime brunch time) but it was fine because we walked around campus until they texted us.   Our food was delicious and our server was great, I highly recommend this spot for brunch. It's MUCH BETTER than Matt's Big Breakfast."}
{"text":"Decent food, but nothing out of the ordinary. Server was nice. Helped us out with a couple recommendations.  Overall, I would say most people come here for the brand more so than than the food. Price is a bit on the higher side for what you're getting in my opinion, but not bad by any means."}
{"text":"The pineapple pancake is really delicious and filling!!! The vibes here is so down to earth. The music is on point and I will definitely come back whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"A great breakfast spot. Loved the French toasts that we tried and look forward to trying other items on the menu.  We live in the far west valley and would definitely drive over here again. Service was amazing as well."}
{"text":"The host was so kind and personable to every guest and our server Flip was awesome. On top of that the food was awesome. Great addition to the Tempe food scene"}
{"text":"The perfect place to enjoy an incredible breakfast/brunch/lunch! For any occasion, including simply waking up. The blueberry danish pancake is close to heaven, definitely dip each bite in the center icing. The service is friendly, attentive & personable. I highly recommend this experience to anyone!!"}
{"text":"It's pretty swell Snooze has meat(less) options for us herbivores.   Our waiter was friendly and kept our cups full... which I'm realizing now is something I weigh heavily when considering a place to munch at.   The lines are almost always insane so just kept that in mind when going. It's a good indication of the grub they offer but not best when you're famished"}
{"text":"I became a fan when it opened in CO and was skeptical when testing the chain down in AZ but not disappointed. I was impressed with how big the area is and how fun of an environment (even has ping-pong tables for when you're waiting). I absolutely love the coffee (also free while waiting) and their OMG french toast always receives an \"oh my god, i've missed food tasting this good\" making it far worth the wait (even though it can be over an hour)."}
{"text":"Looking for the best brunch spot? This is it! Went last Sunday prepared for the wait but so excited to try the food. It was so worth it. The restaraunt was very retro with music playing and a bunch of loud chatter. Loved it. The employees very friendly and gave helpful suggestions.   Now on to the food. I ordered the flight of pancakes with Swedish blueberry, pineapple upside down, and cinnamon roll. So good. Of course our party took little bites of each others food. Chilaquiles Benedict delicious. OMG French Toast yummy. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is my new jam, yo! Music is killer but food was even better. And better yet was the service! Ash was our server and she was great. Fast on the draw and super sweet. She was real busy so the hostess, Natalie, helped out and gave me an awesome idea for what to get. Chili Verde Eggs Benedict. Great place!"}
{"text":"So I came on a Sunday about an hour before they closed.    My real complaint that almost made me walk out without even trying the food was the hostess. I walked in and there were 3 guys at the hostess stand talking to the hostess. No sign that said wait to be seeted so I did not know if you sat yourself or waited on her. I stood for 3 minutes while she flirted with the 3 guys and never acknowledge me. I finally asked excuse me may I just sit anywhere and she said oh yeah the breakfast bar is open have a seat.   I went and sat down and waited another 4 minutes before a server showed up. This did not bother me because they were busy but could have been helped by a halfway decent hostess. The server then had to backtrack to the hostess stand to get me a menu and silverware. She also had to do this for a couple that came in after me and the hostess pointed towards the breakfast bar while continuing her talk with the 3 guys.   Food: Fantastic 4.5 out of 5 I had a half order of eggs Benedict with 1 blueberry streusal pancake. Their made from scratch blueberry topping was amazing. Also their coffee cups are thick enough they retain heat.   Service 3.5 out of 5. My server did a good job and was nice but seemed overwhelmed or over sat.   I wouls love to give them 4 stars but unless they can change their staffing I am not sure I will even go back."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic so expect a wait on weekends. The breakfast burrito is delicious and they have edgy combinations for some of your favorite morning alcoholic beverages. Check out their Bloody Mary list."}
{"text":"My very first impression was not good but it turned around. When we arrived there was no one else waiting to get in, no guests at the hostess stand but us. There was clearly an empty table right in front but we were told \"We are holding that table for someone so you have about a 10 - 15 minute wait.\" That was almost enough to make me leave. However, we sat and waited a bit, then the hostess told us they were not going to hold the table any longer so she sat us. Enter our server Lyle. ADORABLE!!! The sweetest kindest server EVER. I'd go back just for him if I didn't live so far. Then the food arrived. My food looked gorgeous, fresh, yummy! But (although I specifically said \"Nothing spicy\") there was spicy Tajin sprinkled all over the top of my eggs. Lyle apologized for the error and brought me replacement eggs. After that it was perfection. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever! Our server, Phil was great! Awesome atmosphere.. Great way to enjoy Sunday"}
{"text":"Oh my GOSH!!!! DELICIOUS!!! Everything was perfect!!! The atmosphere was amazing and the staff were super friendly! The mocha was perfect, just the right amount of sweet with the most amazing coffee I have ever tasted! The mmmm mmmm mosa was sooo good! I have found my breakfast spot! I might even make this like a tradition! I will go broke and get fat eating here and I am not ashamed!    So the last time we had really bad service. It's been a few since I've been back. Seriously, if you want waited on like royalty, ask for Jason. He definitely works the weekends, I think he said Tuesday was his day off? Anyways! Jason's MY MAN NOW! Hahahaha"}
{"text":"Breakfast the most important meal of the day...but also your start of the day. With all that is hectic in life with work and everything going on in this town one would want a good breakfast experience.   Upon arrival for a late breakfast I walked in just before 2 groups who were being sat by the hostess. The hostess being busy did not greet me and the mod came and greeted me and got me sat. I chose to sit at the breakfast bar which had to be cleaned. The manager told me someone would be with me soon... nearly 15 minutes later a server finally came over to take my drink order. By then I already knew what i wanted to eat and drink. I ordered both at the same time since who knows how long it would be if I order the two separate. At this time if the waitress had not come by I was mere seconds from walking out. Being that I also work in the same type of industry I understand and would wait but this was pretty long wait.   After ordering, a few minutes later the server arrived with my coffee and water. I had ordered the breakfast pot pie with scrambled eggs. This is the same thing I order every time I come to Snooze, here and in San Diego. I waited close to 30 min for my order... during this time no visit from the server or anyone to say anything about the order taking so long. Again mere seconds from walking and some guy brings my order. At this point my short quick breakfast was nearing 45 minutes and I was survived by the sugar and caffeine from my coffee. I was so hungry that as I dove face first violently into the hash brown hockey puck I noticed that my egg was not scrambled but was over medium. Not just that it was a mistake over medium but a perfectly cooked to order over medium egg, now that is great if you like it that way but I'm very particular to how I like my eggs and I like them scrambled. Had we been at the point where I didn't wait forever for my food that I would have asked for them made over, but I have the rest of my day to get started. In a hungry starvation induced fit of rage I finished most of the hash brown to notice that there was a great portion of it being al dente. Which would have been great if it was pasta but potatoes...   Life was great, I met some awesome people this year and made some great memories... then I walked into snooze. I know we all have that one bad day, the day where everything goes wrong. This was that day for snooze, we crashed today... and you almost took me down with you. Well let's just say that I will be giving this location a break for a long time. I recommended so many people to this place and now I'm regretting it as I hope that they didn't get the same experience as I have. Well next time I go for breakfast maybe i'll go to Denny's instead."}
{"text":"I frequent the Camelback location and always leave with a happy tummy! Everything on the menu is delicious and typically large portions! If you're looking for an amazing breakfast joint because you're hungry, hungover or finishing up a hike this place is for you!! Grab a morning marg and you'll be set!"}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best breakfast places and food establishments I've ever been to. It's so modern and stylish. Great service and extremely good food. I cannot wait to go back to AZ to eat here!"}
{"text":"Fabulous little breakfast joint! Great vibe and very friendly staff.  We ordered the breakfast burrito, and after a night of boozing, it was like heaven wrapped inside a tortilla.    The only downfall was our food took a bit long to come out but given the amount of people that were there, it was understandable.  Great find on Yelp!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  The only complaint was I felt service was very slow. Our waiter basically disappeared after giving us water. It took 20 mins to come back and get order then quite a bit of time to get food. We got there at 9 am food was delivered at 10:25.  Nice to have a leisurely breakfast on a Saturday morning but not to feel like you have been forgotten."}
{"text":"Great place.   Food good and unusual items.  Downtown Tempe Az.  Atmosphere fun old and young people.  Service very good and happy"}
{"text":"We were here from out of town to have breakfast and omg this place wayyyy exceeded my expectations! First of all it was super busy but we were able to sit outside right away it was nice and sunny!  Our waitress was sooo nice!  The hot cocoa she said would be the best I've had and yes it was I was craving some now that I'm back home!  The eggs Benedict was the best we ever had it was perfect and the hash browns on the side amazing as well!  Since we were there from out of town our waitress brought over a pancake for us to try had blueberry and cream cheese it was good! My boyfriend also loved his mocha!  We can't wait to come back to visit again we will definitely be coming here!  And bring one to Oregon please!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal.  First time here with my two best friend,  the bloody Mary,  mojito,  Bennies and pancakes so delicious. I had the Bangkok bloody Mary and Benny Goodman with Cinnamon crunch pancakes,  amazeball!"}
{"text":"All hail the new king!  King of breakfast sandwiches that is - the Sam I Am!  This awesome pretzel roll of love just told any other ordinary breakfast sandwich to beat it!  The sausage on this beauty has just enough kick to keep the taste buds interested!  The flavor combo is what every AM needs. Bow down breakfast sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for this true gem. I love the food and the service gets no better. Awesome... open up during dinner \"PM Eatery\""}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Love the laid back atmosphere.  The omelet was AMAZING.  Pick your 3 favorite fillers and enjoy!  I chose mushrooms, spinach, and avocado!  Lean mean and green! Service was quick, friendly, and educated on all their dishes!"}
{"text":"After waiting 20 minutes we were texted that our table was ready. Another lady said she was me and was seated. When the hostess finally got back to me she realized what happened, never apologized and said there would be 1-2 tables ahead of us. After waiting another 25 minutes checked back with the hostess and said they were told we were sitting at the bar. We've been standing there for 45 minutes and they kept looking at us. After telling them we were leaving they said they'd put us back on the list and there's only be 1-2 tables ahead of us. Why wouldn't you get us seated next? We left and probably won't be back. You need a better system for people waiting!"}
{"text":"I was in town for Dodgers Spring training and turned to Yelp for some breakfast places. I'm so glad we were introduced to this place! All the food was so yummy! We even went 2 days in a row, because we just couldn't find another place that was comparable. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great environment, smiling faces. The food was good and would have been better had the over-medium eggs been a tad (ALOT!) less slimy. I brought it to the attention of our very friendly waiter and he simply smiled and said \"oh, sorry about that\", with no offer whatsoever to make it right. Disappointing."}
{"text":"We frequent this location a couple times a year hopping for better service but we are always disappointed.  The food is really good here. Great selection and farm to table concept.  The service is just awful,  the wait times are horrible in that they are completely inaccurate.  Wait time for your food is thirty plus minutes from when they take your order."}
{"text":"Banana pancakes. That's all I have to say. This is your carb loading station. I was good and had bacon and eggs but after tasting the pancakes, I will certainly head back on my next carb-hunger day. Nice clean place, great service. Prices are Biltmore prices, so what? YOLO, right? This place is special. We need more special"}
{"text":"So incredible!! We had the pancake flight with the pineapple upside down, pb, and blueberry danish pancakes and they were incredible. The blueberry danish was our absolute favorite! We also had the Benedict. I forget which one, but it has corn on the side, and quinoa cakes. Absolutely amazing! Already dying to go back!"}
{"text":"recently decided to try a new breakfast place and Snooze was the choice.   What a surprising and delicious find.   Went with my boyfriend and a friend, and there was an error in my order, before i even noticed they had brought me my plate, just a few minutes later than the other two and had not charged me for it.   Service was amazing and food was delicious, this is definitely a place i encourage to try and you will love it."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast plain and simple.  You have to try their breakfast pot pie and their pineapple pancakes.  Seriously both of those are amazeballs and will send your taste buds into ecstasy!!    Only complaint is that they lack seating and during their busy times they rush you out once you are done eating... a bit more than any other restaurant.  So I wouldn't suggest going on weekend mornings during busy times if you want a nice relaxed breakfast.  You will feel quite rushed and won't get to enjoy the place.  Kinda sucks but I guess they have to get as many people seated as possible.  Still worth it for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"They say,  if you Snooze you loose. Can't say what this place is like.  When we arrived and were told in a very cheerful manner 'the expected wait is 1 to 1.25 hours for a table' we drove on.  Really?  And no reservation options either.  What a let down!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday. I have tried to go several times on the weekend but the wait was always well over an hour. Overall, the decoration and vibe if the restaurant were nice. However, the service was very slow. It took about 25 to 30 minutes to get our food, our waitress barely checked on us, and our drinks stayed empty the majority of the time. I agree with other reviewers that it appears that their sweeter items may be better than their savory. We had the Sandwich I Am and the Green Eggs and Hamwich. The green eggs and hamwich was a good size but not too flavorful and overpowered by the spinach. The ham on it was tasty. The other sandwich was average. We had the side of fruit which was extra and pretty small but okay. We had a side if hash browns which were good. They did offer me a beverage to go which was nice. Overall it was okay but nothing I would wait in line for. There are better breakfast options within a few blocks of here."}
{"text":"At the Snooze restaurant in Gilbert with my family, they were very busy and on a long wait. We expected that going in. It was, of course, a Sunday morning. We put our name on the list, a 35-55 minute wait. We have never been to a Snooze location and not had to wait. The food is worth it.   I saw a solo seat open at the bar. Excited, I walk up to order a latte. If I'm going to wait an hour then I should get some caffeine. The bartender came over to me. I had my drink order ready to ramble off to her. Before I could say anything she informed me that the bar is for full service dinning customers and that I could wait outside. Confused, I told her that I wanted to order a latte. She then stated that I could order from the cocktail waitress. She pointed her out to me. I turned to see where the cocktail waitress was but she was already walking up to us. She must have seen her co-worker turning us away. She also told us the same thing, we can't sit there but we could wait outside. She took my drink order, thankfully. \"Can I have a hot almond milk latte with caramel please?\" As I sat at the bar, now waiting for my drink, another employee came to tell me the exact same thing. \"This is for full service customers; if I'm waiting for a table then I can wait outside.\" My husband and I were confused, I just wanted a drink then I was going to move. They must really not want my business. The cocktail waitress brings the drink and I give her my credit card. As I'm waiting for my receipt, another bartender comes to tell me again that I need to move. I have a drink in front of me, I'm a paying customer! I let her know that  I'm just waiting to sign my bill. I'm very aggravated. Here I am sitting at the bar, my husband and one year old son standing next me, just wanting some caffeine while I wait for our table. It's summer and even though it's only 10:00am it's already 100 degrees outside. I'd rather not take my baby out there! Also, this happened all within 20 minutes. I was not sitting there very long what so ever. We arrived at 10 and were seated by 10:30am.  The couple sitting next to me must have seen how embarrassed and upset I was. They agreed that I should be able to order a cup of coffee in peace. They offered to buy my drink for the trouble they had put me through. I had already paid but it was nice that another customer noticed how I was being treated. They had sat down after me and they were treated with respect.    Just thinking, if I weren't a young female and dark skinned than maybe they would not have been so rude. I hate to even think that. I wish that I could say that they were being impolite for another reason but I'm not positive. None of these employees were the nicest about asking me to move. Just imagine, if I were an older white lady, would they have talked to me the same? I highly doubt it. The gentleman who sat down in the seat after me, doing the same thing, didn't get hassled one bit. However, he happened to be white. Why was is necessary to tell me 4 times within 20 minutes that I couldn't sit there, even though I ordered something from the bar? It may be a restaurant policy to only have those who want to eat up at the bar. But then why have a bar top at all? Is it not common practice to order drinks at a bar? Did I miss the big sign saying I couldn't be there?   I don't like confrontation and I didn't want to make a scene. My stomach was in knots the entire rest of the time I was at the restaurant. Should I tell the manager what happened? I was afraid not only to make a scene but also that the manager would also treat me the same way. I was taught that good girls don't make a fuss. How many times has that come back to haunt me? Another one bites the dust. I'll just put my head down and pretend nothing happened. I did not want my husband or son to see me bothered.   Once I was home I couldn't help but break down and cry. The entire Ism's in my life had all festered into this one incident. Racism, Sexism, and Ageism: A young, dark skinned female. This will not change. That is who I am. Treat me differently if you must. I will grow stronger with each ism encounter"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Angela was very attentive and knowledgeable. The food was delicious and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I don't like the round tables in the middle. Only two to a seat for sure. Unless you are smaller. I was uncomfortable when i was there. The service was good. The food was alright, not my absolute favorite. I think it is because I heard it was  supposed to be really good and the wait is always crazy long. So when I got my food, I did enjoy it, but not my favorite brunch type food. The taste was alright, but it didn't match their presentation. Such a trendy presentation of food, but didn't feel like anything was mind blowing, but maybe that is what they were striving for all along... hipsters confuse me."}
{"text":"Three of us headed for Sunday breakfast after good workouts. Arrived 8am and waited 20 mins. Joe was our server-outstanding in efficiency, friendly and revisited the table throughout the meal. Three different breakfasts - breakfast tacos, caprese benedict and quinoa porridge!  All were delicious and right portioned. Will be back!  Simply worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast/ brunch.  Really cutely named dishes.  A bit on the pricy side but the food is good.  The snooze hot chocolate isnt very good, it was made with milk which was great but the chocolate wasnt enough which made it taste like bery mild flavored chocolate milk.  But it was topped with a giant ball of whippes cream! Ordered the flight of pancakes which allows you to pick a combo of 3 pancakes, the peanut butter cup one was the best, followed by the blueberry danish one and lastly the chocolate chip one.  Great service!  But definitely a wait.  Loved that they would text you when your table was ready!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, hands-down.  Service...amazing!  Atmosphere.....if you have piercings, tattoos, unshaved arm pits (Girls), the latest Hemp clothing fashion....you will love to eat or work here."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely incredible! I love it and they are very accommodating to those with food allergies. I love their food and would recommend bringing friends, family or anyone from out of town here for breakfast. Very comfortable environment."}
{"text":"Snooze is perfection. The inside of the restaurant is very cute. I love the current vibe that they have going on. It is very welcoming. The wait can be a bit much...once I had to wait as much as an hour for breakfast...I have never before had to wait that long anywhere else. This was also just for 2 people. However, it is very much worth it. The ham Benedict is amazing. The holandase sauce is to die for. The service sucked to be honest. Maybe, it waa just because it was extremely busy. I saw my waitress twice -- once during the order and once during the bill. She never came to check up or refill the water. I had to ask someone else. The portions are pretty small for what you pay for, or at least what I got ..it was just a black of hash browns and 2 ham benedicts. It was not too filling."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in Arizona. Do yourself a favor and get the Benedict. The ham Benedict is incredible."}
{"text":"The wait was a little long but what can you expect when you go to such a great restaurant! the staff is also very nice and attentive, I will definitely continue to keep going"}
{"text":"Always love coming here! I'm not a big sweets person (especially for breakfast) but OH MY their pineapple upside down pancake is ahhmazing. I definitely recommend checking this place out if you haven't yet. Just be cautious that there's usually a wait (and for good reason)."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had! Definitely will be returning! Amazing customer service! Keep it up snooze"}
{"text":"Love Snooze! Get the pancake flight - it will not disappoint! The food is so amazing and they pretty much have a menu that is inclusive enough for anyone's appetite. The seating can suck pretty bad, depending on where you get stuck. Outdoor seating is absolutely unbearable during the summer, since there are no misters. Most of the inside seating is cramped and full of flies."}
{"text":"Visited for the second time this morning, and food was just as good as the first time. So far, we've tried six dishes and all have been excellent. The house made sausage is great, the corned beef hash is out of this world, and even though I'm not much of a pancake fan, the sweet potato and carrot cake pancakes were excellent as well. Service earned them the fifth star; on both visits we've been served by Chelsea and she has done a spectacular job--even offered me a roadie for my coffee on our first visit before Christmas. Looking forward to making Snooze a regular player in our weekend breakfast rotation!"}
{"text":"well after a less than favorable review I was promptly contacted by Rebecca from their corporate offices. she was very interested in what I had to say. She asked if she bought our next meal would we be willing to try them 1 more time? Why not... I'm glad we did. What a difference. Britt, our server was outstanding. The food came out shortly after we ordered. It was hot and fresh. Long story short, I will definitely be going back. Good food and good management."}
{"text":"Delicious Breakfast place. They are creative with food. There is a lot of great offerings including drinks."}
{"text":"Ok here is the deal, this place has amazingly delicious food, however the two hour wait for lunch is ridiculous!  I don't know if I got there on an off day but waiting that long for eggs and bacon is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Snooze hit the mark today with an excellent corn beef hash and good service. Plan on a long wait line but relax, have coffee or a drink while waiting and then enjoy some good food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing ! The service was fantastic ! Great service with excellent food !  Pancakes are absolutely perfect !   My eggs were on point .   Thank you for doin things right !   Bloody Mary's are fantastic the morning marg was absolutely epic as well !   There can and will be a long wait but hey every restaurant in down town Gilbert has a long wait ! But it is so worth every minute !    Our waitress was so friendly and attentive .   Thanks again for an amazing late breakfast !   We truly enjoyed it !"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and I always leave with a happy stomach. Warning: There is always an extremely long wait on weekends. When I went today, I got the pancake of the day which was a strawberries and white chocolate one (you can order single pancakes). It was super fluffy and I got a bite of strawberry with each bite. I also ordered the BEAT sandwich, and the bacon tomato aioli was to die for. The ciabatta bread was nice and soft, and overall it was delicious. My all time favorite pancake is the sweet potato one. Whenever I bring someone new there, I force them to try it and they never regret it. If you prefer french toast, I highly recommend the OMG French Toast because it is amazing."}
{"text":"Snooze is a hipster breakfast spot located right by ASU. We visited on a Saturday and waited an hour to be seated. It's worth the wait.   The table ordered the deluxe Benedicts half steak and eggs and the other ham. The steak Benedict's is a must try. The meat was extremely tender and flavorful it was served with harsh browns and veggies. It's also topped with holiday sauce and green toppings that tasted like pesto. I wish I ordered just the steak. Instead of bread it's served with something else that's amazing. The ham Benedict was good too.  We also tried three pancakes the pineapple upside down, blueberries, and another one that tasted like amazing dessert. There small but man it's a great portion. Their version of small is the size of my hand.   Overall great breakfast spot but get ready for a wait."}
{"text":"Food was very good and their bread is very delicious.  The service was so so, had I wanted a second cup of coffee I would have waited awhile.  Why I am rating at 3 stars, it felt like I was eating in a gymnasium.  The place has nothing to absorb all the noise and the beating music in the background just adds to the noise chaos!   Yes it was good to see people talking and enjoying one another's company vs sitting and looking at iPhones.  But I felt like I had to yell in order to have a decent conversation.  Friendly staff, clean surroundings.  Cute items with their logo and loved the story of where their coffee comes from.  I am going to say a lot of time has gone into the creation of snooze.  Now they need to find a way to absorb the noise and for me it would be a perfect breakfast spot."}
{"text":"A first visit to this location.  Seated immediately indoors as patio was n/a.  Lots of friendly staff milling around but service was slow, especially from the kitchen.  The trio of tacos and shrimp grits bowl were well crafted.  The bacon & egg sandwich had a bit of a fishy taste.  Cocktail mixology good but the champagne glass was sticky on the outside."}
{"text":"Average !  This is our second time here and service was still quite slow. Too many other choices in Gilbert to give more stars than three. Food was tasty and very good coffee !"}
{"text":"An amazing breakfast spot that will have something for everyone in your group ! We had a sample of the OMG French toast and it was fantastic . I hate sweet things for breakfast but thy managed to make it not gnawingly sweet - instead it had notes of creaminess and butteriness , salt and fresh strawberries . For the meal I had the Bella eggs Benedict with crispy hash browns . If you ask for them crispy they actually deliver and flatten the pile to brown them all over . The Bella was delicious , the prochutto (can't spell that (: ) was a salty and they give you enough to really taste it in the dish . The cream cheese hollandaise was decadent , the arugula fresh and peppery , and the balsamic sweet . A perfect combo of flavors , I wouldn't add anything . My friend had one chilaquiles Benedict  and she has gotten it multiple times because she loves it so much . The wait was not bad for us because we were there at noon and the outdoor seating was shady but no misters or fans to keep you cool . For the good food sitting outside in the summer was worth it , just plan for a wait of some kind . The waitress was great and all the staff was very nice . I almost forgot , the drinks are amazing ! They have a large menu for a breakfast spot (lots of options just like the food menu) . I got the grapefruit elderflower mimosa and I had two it was so yummy . My friend had a chai drink with coffee liquor , fantastic . Try it all !"}
{"text":"Atmosphere awesome. Very chic and hip little spot! Food was amazing and staff was super friendly! Great portion size and selection! Comingbfrom the pickiest eater, this spot is absolutely a must! Great way to end this AZ road trip!!"}
{"text":"Service B, ambiance D-  music as loud as a disco would not lower volume. Unable to have conversation without SHOUTING.  AT 7 AM VERY annoying  Hash B- poached eggs  B, but what is just one piece of toast,  Overall experience C+"}
{"text":"Was visiting for the Tempe Half Ironman in October, 2017. We have Snooze in Colorado, so I knew what to expect. This location did not disappoint.   Since I was by myself, I had no problem getting a seat, but if you come with a family or a group, you may end up waiting.   This restaurant treats breakfast like a dinner; meaning, they turn it up a notch. The food is creative and of good quality. During my short stay, I came here twice so I could try different things on the menu, the menu is that compelling.   Given the areas, the prices were not unreasonable."}
{"text":"food: eggs benny duo. beef and salmon. i like how you can get both. i always have that trouble. i want to eat everything on the menu. the salmon is more like a lox and bagel deal, which i liked because it's not as briny as it is on a bagel. the beef is like a bbq kind of thing. tender beef on top of an egg. ***4/5  service: i came in as soon as the door opened. plans didnt work out. server was nice. got my food hot and delicious. ample seats, but then i was very early. ***4/5  value: i liked how you can do a combo on the benedicts. i can try the whole menu faster. the quality and service is great. price is good for the portion. ***4/5"}
{"text":"Free coffee while you wait for your table!  I had the 3 Egg Scramble with a Blueberry Danish Pancake. AWESOME!! Everything was super delicious. Service was very slow that's the reason for 4/5 star rating. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"It's a great place for kids if you didn't get up at the crack of dawn to avoid a wait. They have Foosball, ring toss, and ping pong outside. My kid literally didn't care that we waited about 20 minutes. The service was a little slow on the inside, but ok. They put some chives on their bacon. Fine for adults, but my kiddo flipped. Picking chives off bacon sucked. And it's so unusual to have bacon topped with anything I didn't even mention it. That said, I'd totally go again."}
{"text":"The food and service is great. I ordered a mimosa and the OMG French Toast. I recommend a table outside on the patio."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Tempe. They are dog friendly, which is awesome. There are no bad options on the menu, and the prices are reasonable. Great staff. Always friendly."}
{"text":"We will be going back to this location. The people are super friendly and the cooks are amazing. Try the am Manhattan and the dharma rum. Also, I'm pretty sure there isn't a bad item in this menu.   UPDATE: THESE PEOPLE GET COOLER AND COOLER EVERY TIME YOU COME HERE!!! THIS IS A MUST VISIT FOR BREAKFAST/BRUNCH!!!! Try the mmm mmm mimosa too. Everything on this menu is to die for."}
{"text":"Snooze you lose?? Not here!  I came here after landing from the airport on a red eye flight. I was famished and ready for some breakfast goodies.  In the mood to feast, I ordered the best two items on the menu: Chilaquelles Benny ($11.50) and short stack of sweet potato pancakes ($3.50). This was the first time I ate Chilaquelles Benedict. Heard of it? It's a stacked dish with tortillas, melted cheese and seasoned beef. The taste immediately woke up my taste buds! The circular hash browns were perfectly crispy and the poached egg was cooked with the yolk oozing out.  If you want to sample the sweet potato pancake ($3.50), order a short stack (one flapjack) because there is probably no way you can finish a full order. Dusted with powdered sugar, it was slightly over dressed by caramel syrup and could have survived with it's own flavor.   I arrived at 10AM and it was still jumping. Be prepared to wait and drool over everyone's order. Our service was pleasant and prompt.  Afterwards, I was ready to snooze!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic. Came on a recommendation from a friend and I'm probably not going to add anything many other reviews on here have said.   Fantastic options for breakfast and brunch here.  Multiple Benedict options they even let you mix-and-match presentations. Pancakes are ridiculous the blueberry danish and pineapple upside down cake pancakes are sweet perfection.  Again they let you do a pancake trio so you can try multiple flavor options.  I had the breakfast pot pie.  Fluffy pastry filled with  rosemary sausage gravy and topped with an egg prepared to your choice. My friends had the breakfast burrito, the breakfast tacos, (both huge), as well as the Benedict's.  Highly recommend adding one of the pancakes (I had the blueberry danish one).  Friendly staff here to give recommendations, very clean, great vibe in this place."}
{"text":"Had brunch here yesterday with my girlfriend, in from out of town. Honestly chose this place because of their yelp reviews and happy I did.  Super great food, really good drinks! Sat at the bar and Starchild helped us! I recommend the Brewmossa and Eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"Everything from the food, to the presentation, and to the service is on point. The drinks are so much fun. It gets really packed on the weekends so try to get there earlier rather than later! Great for families and couples alike. Can't go wrong and definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Fun retro decor. All of the pancakes are great. The pineapple pancakes are especially superb. Friendly staff. Excellent service. Will return whenever we are in Tempe."}
{"text":"The popularity of this place is baffling. The 30-40 minute waits are absurd. The pancakes are cakey, dry and crusty -- yes you read that correctly.  Their consistency reminded me of low quality gluten-free pancakes, so possibly my order was incorrectly prepared.  Serving temps were luke warm. The house music was strangely evocative of  a club atmosphere -- 9:00 am Friday morning?  All in all, a wholly underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"Worst servers ever. Great food! Absolutely the worst service I've encountered. I'm a server so my patience is high, but it's been every time we've come here it's been beyond crappy service every single time. Horrible horrible horrible, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Snooze reached out to me after writing my preview review and asked me to give them another shot on them and sent me a gift card. They asked me to let them know when I came in, but I didn't feel like I could update a review if the service was based on them knowing that I would be reviewing them again, so I didn't say anything. I came back with my family and we had very little wait time. The service was SO much better, and our food came out hot this time. Overall, it was a much better experience, so I'm updating my rating to give them one more star."}
{"text":"Ate here today with my boyfriend for our first time ever! Food was so amazing, especially the monkey French toast. The staff was extremely friendly and patient especially because we took forever to decide what we wanted :) already can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm a huge breakfast lover, so to find a place with an extensive, fun and delicious breakfast menu always gives me the good vibes.  And Snooze definitely delivers on all facets.  On this trip, we had the Chile Verde Benny (pork green chile Benedict) and the BEAT (bacon, egg, arugula, tomato) breakfast sandwich.  Each dish came with a side of hashbrowns.  For the benedict,all I can say is WOW!!!!!  The pork and chile hollandaise were out of this world good. I was sopping up every inch of sauce from that plate.  I am 100% ordering it again, and I think my bf was a little jealous of my order.  Not that his sandwich wasn't fantastic (it was incredibly tasty), but that benedict dish is an absolute star.  And fun side note: if you enjoy coffee, and specifically their coffee, you can buy a bag of beans to take home :)  I didn't buy a bag on this trip, but am definitely considering it the next time I go.  If you go on a weekend, expect a bit of a wait, but trust me...it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Snooze is close to home, I've eaten there a few times.  It teeters on the edge of 4 stars, but doesn't quite achieve it.  Firstly...  As a proprietor, they need to get in touch with Town & Country management.  There is no reason diners should have to listen to a leaf blower for 10 minutes when we're trying to relax with the treat of Sunday breakfast out.  The building was designed thoughtfully allowing for an \"island\" effect and totally opening up so it is just a roof over head.  This doesn't work if there is a leaf blower 15 feet away.  On to the latte.  The latte mug is not a traditional shape, and does not work well for a foamy beverage.  Additionally I was told that they no longer provide Sweet N Low, which is the only sweetener I can use.  I'll either have to bring my own or go somewhere else in the future.  I buy a box 1500 packets for $10 at Costco - I'm not sure why they can't.  For the meal, I chose eggs benedict with ham.  While they have about 7 varieties of eggs benedict, they do not have traditional eggs benedict.  The hollandaise sauce was unique - not bad at all but not traditional.  I would have preferred a traditional eggs benedict offering.  Overall, it is A-OK, but they could easily move to 4 stars with Sweet N Low and no leaf blower and considering having a traditional eggs benedict since they offer so many varieties."}
{"text":"5 stars easy! This atmosphere is incomparable to any Denny's or iHOP that you've been to. The design of their interiors is unique and provides an unforgettable dining experience. Their meals are a little out of the ordinary but if you're open to it, your tastebuds are in for a treat. I tried their breakfast burrito and pot pie... AMAZEBALLS.  Shout out to Spencer our host for getting us a free pineapple pancake just for being \"Cool\" don't miss out on this place. Clean and fun."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in town. Awesome decor and friendly staff, but its the food that really shines. I am usually more of a bacon and eggs person, never really like pancakes from restaurants because they always taste so plain, but Snooze's pancakes are outstanding. I always get a flight so I can try different ones. The pumpkin one (I think they were seasonal) were my favorite, I would have dreams about them. Seriously."}
{"text":"Check this place out for sure. Excellent service, food, and atmosphere. I had Juan's tacos and was not disappointed. I will be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"In my opinon, when a restaurant has a waiting Time  of 45 or more and folks are willing to wait, it must be worth it. Our wait time was 60 minutes...not horrible since they are by the Farmers Market and we could browse and shop while we wait and they'll text when a table is ready.  This what we did, then came back to Snooze, enjoyed a cocktail then text us the table was ready.  We ordered the Benny Duo, which offered us two choices since we couldn't decide. Both of us enjoyed our choices of food; the mimosa and bloody Mary was outstanding. Service was spot on. We were able to enjoy our food  and drinks, some music and a lot of laughs. As far as the price, I could not complain. Two breakfasts 4 cocktails for $40 is not bad. We REALLY enjoyed everything from start to finish. My friend was here from Vegas, but said when they come back she wants to come back. I'm a local and will most definitely be back. Thank you Snooze for an amazing experience."}
{"text":"I don't go out for breakfast often but when I do... I Snooze! In San Diego or different locations in the Phoenix metro. Their food is delicious and it is always such a fun vibe! Every bite is a party for your palette."}
{"text":"We usually have a great time here. But today's was the worst ever. Our server was the most inattentive I have ever seen. Twice we had to bother other servers to get help. Food is always good but today was a bit unacceptable from a servers standpoint."}
{"text":"I go to Snooze a lot not just in Arizona but in California as well and today I decided to take my sister who has never gone and we got two meals plus a kids meal and we were highly disappointed not just in our meals but in our service. we were not checked on and our food tasted pretty weird so the tip was way low and our food just sucked I probably won't be back for a long time Thanks."}
{"text":"Delicious. My waiters have always been very knowledgeable and helped me with my daughter. I really appreciate it when someone takes the time to do that! Everything I've tried on the menu has been spectacular. The eggs Benedict was my favorite though. Great atmosphere, perfect for a hangover meal Or an after church lunch."}
{"text":"Another great Sunday starting at Snooze on Camelback Phoenix near the Biltmore corridor. Busy every morning especially Sunday it's a go to favorite visiting family in the area. Enjoy the consistent high quality breakfast usually getting the eggs Benedict Bella Bella or a combination of two of other favorites including  chilaquiles & chili verde always done to snooze perfection . A retro mcm vibe it's always fun. We have had server Charles before he's great, thank you! Worth the wait you can't loose!"}
{"text":"First time this morning and let me just say.. delicious! The food came out right on time nice and warm. The hot chocolate is a must! And the service was great!!! No complaints! Definitely going again!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Snooze, it was in San Diego. The portions are a bit different from San Diego to Arizona. However, I was satisfied with the food.   I ordered the corner beef dish, which the taste is never disappointing. However, it was definitely smaller than the one I've ordered in San Diego.   My friend ordered a pot pie with a side of pancakes. The pot pie was amazing! I highly recommend that. The crust was really light, which is perfect for people like me who do not enjoy heavy crusts.   I recommend this place nonetheless to people whom are looking for a breakfast place. I don't recommend going on weekends since I'm sure there will be a long wait. I recommend jumping on a table outside to eat and go."}
{"text":"Cool eclectic look and menu great combinations on breakfast. Service was friendly place was clean. They have a full bar. Would definitely come back again when I'm on vacation. Go during the week there is an hour wait on weekends"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have ever had!  Worth any wait!  We had the pancake of the day, eggs Benedict and the chorizo hash.  Everything was seasoned perfectly.  And they had a ping-pong table outside.  Loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I'm so late to the show here.  This place is GREAT.  It's packed as hell, You *will* wait, but it's worth it.  Great service, awesome old school vibe (it's like being on the Jetson's set) and even better is the food.  We split the pancake flight:  the Sinful (cinnamon, bacon, pecans), Pineapple Upside Down and the Pumpkin with white chocolate chips and some other stuff.  The Sinful was my absolute favorite. This is a huge amount of very very rich pancakes that you could easily share with someone.   We *also* split the breakfast pot pie.  YUM.  I loved that it was open faced, served on a fluffy, buttery puff pastry.  They also top it with eggs, but I detest any runny yolk so I got them scrambled on the side. I loved the pot pie and it wasn't too too filling (in a good way). This place has a variety of morning drinks (mimosas and such) and are really reasonably priced.   This will be a regular on my brunch lineup!"}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out after hearing good things and apparently so did half of Phoenix. We waited a good 45 minutes before being seated, and even then, it was at the bar. The food was great and I loved the wide variety of brunch cocktails. The wait was a big turn off, but everything else was great."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday morning around 8:30am and waited an hour for a table outside for 5 plus a high chair. The wait wasn't that bad. There was enough space to sit out front and they sent you a text once your table is ready. We didn't get our food until 10am. I ordered the tacos. The menu said it came with a sauce, but there was no sauce on the plate. I didn't say anything. I just wanted to eat. It was really good food. We sat right next to the condiments, so we didn't have to ask for much help. We asked for a cup of ice and didn't get it until we got the check. The hashbrowns are really crispy and flavorful. Everyone's food looked really good. There was a lot of color on the plate. I ordered a side jalapeno and it was hot! Be careful! We all finished our meals and didn't offer to share! I would go back again, but on a weekday. Be careful with the cutlery. My knife had dried food on it. I didn't need it, so I didn't ask for another one.  Go early with people you can talk to for hours without eating much before hand. Invite me along! I need to find more people I can be around before I've had breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast location. If you love eggs Benedict as much as I do, you must come here to try what they offer. You can mix and match the different styles to get a taste of the variety. Definitely worth checking out whether you're in town for a week or a local!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy coming here for breakfast dates while the kids are in school. During the week you will have little to no wait tune but the weekends are rough. It's not even an option for us. We have always had great service and this past visit was excellent. Courtney may have been the best server we've ever had. I got an omelette with a sweet potato pancake and my wife got the \"Sandwich I am.\" It was fantastic. My wife also really likes the iced mocha's. I wish they had a few more side options that weren't carb based. Something like cottage cheese. But that's really not why you come here."}
{"text":"Had a good first experience here We had called over weekend and been old there was an hour wait On tues we got seated immediately The hollandaise was very good and the filling in the Danish pancakes was great Bloody Mary was a lil weak but I'll def be back to try more food"}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp for breakfast. All items were quite tasty, especially the sweet potato pancakes. Service was fine, but food seemed to take long to arrive. Maybe the kitchen was backed-up, don't know. Breakfast items seem to be quick to prepare. Overall, it is definitely worth trying Snooze, and we will next time we're near one."}
{"text":"Took my best friend out this morning (a Saturday) for a birthday breakfast, and we had a great experience! We arrived at 6:45 am, there were a couple guests already seated inside. It was a nice morning, so we requested outdoor seating. Absolutely no wait this early in the morning, even on a weekend! (-: I ordered cranberry juice (a little pricey at $3 for a very small glass - my only complaint) & she had coffee. Then I ordered the Pancake Flight (I chose Pineapple Upside a Down, Strawberry Shortcake & the chocolate/cinnamon/pecan special of the day) - heavenly! My friend ordered the OMG French toast & raved over it! The bill was $26 for us both. Service was very quick and super courteous! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Place was great... with so many breakfast and coffee options in this area I feel like I stepped into Seattle on a freaky warm and sunny day. Staff here was great and the Ham Bennie was on point!   On a side note, lately I've been over-tipping as little experiment. I took my average tip from 18-20% to 35-40% with a minimum of $10. This place wrapped up my 20 restaurant experiment.   Interestingly, I haven't noticed any change in the mannerism of the servers. I don't know if they think I don't know how to tip or 35-40% just isn't enough to get their attention. Also, it's not in cash, so maybe the larger tip loses its' effectiveness when paid by amex.  Respectfully, I'm curious at what point a server gives you the extra smile and 'thank you' as you walk out the door.   Next experiment... I'm still going to pay by card, I do too many business meals and like the points. So I will zero out the credit card tip and tip out in cash. Minimum $10 and average of 40-50%. I will also try to round up to the nearest $10, $20 and $50 bill. I will let you know how it goes.   And remember, food service is usually a pretty thankless job with some crummy hours. I encourage you to over tip and find the line between 'sucker' and making someone's day better. Besides, aren't smiles priceless?"}
{"text":"Went in today for the first time time with coworkers. Everyone was happy with their food and service! The only feedback that I got was that the sausages were too salty and the bacon tasted like plastic, but besides that everything was great! The other good thing is gat it's open so early! Super beneficial to those that start at 7 or 8am their workdays."}
{"text":"Great place! Great atmosphere! Servers are really attentive. The only downside is that the wait can be long but is not the restaurant fault! When you get sat down, the food comes relatively fast. Awesome place to have a wonderful with friends and family."}
{"text":"To be honest, the food was not good at all. Nothing special, nothing that would have me coming back for more. I got the Ham Benedict III and bro there were eggshells in my food and my hash browns were cold. Like thanks chef for not even doing your job right. Prime example of \"you had one job\". I also order a side of ham so that I could have a leaner alternative to bacon but OH NELLY, that was the definition of regret and mistake. It came out cold and I almost threw up. In addition, the service sucked like a vacuum. My party and I asked frequently for more napkins and ketchup and guess what??? WE NEVER GOT IT!!! Another example of \"you had one job\". I understand that restaurants get busy and they forget and stuff but the thing is...there were hardly anyone, no parties were waiting for a table and many tables were open. In addition, we asked other servers and NOTHING!!! Hashtag I would never go here again even if my life depended on it."}
{"text":"Really long line, but the pancake flight is something a pregnant woman needs in their life. Sweet potato was my favorite.  All us gals shared, and my other favorite thing was the French toast with custard inside. To. Die. For."}
{"text":"Came here again as the manager of this location reached out to me and invited me back.  My friend and I came in on a busy Friday morning. There was a long wait but we were able to grab a spot at one of the high top tables facing the window. I got the eggs Benedict the third, my favorite. I definitely appreciate that there are hooks underneath the table so you can hang your bag/purse.  The customer service was much better this time around. If I'm in Tempe I'll definitely keep this Snooze location on my list for possible breakfast joints."}
{"text":"I went to Snooze with a couple of my friends yesterday and I was blown away with how amazing their food and service was.  I had the \"OMG French Toast\" and it was delicious! The syrup they had was scrumptious and it was the best French toast I have ever had! It was very sweet.  One of my friends had three different types of pancakes and the sweet potato pancakes were to die for. All of the pancakes were good that she had but that was the highlight.  I also got hash browns and eggs on the side. The eggs were okay and the hashbrown was delicious! I was not disappointed with it at all.  So I give snooze 5/5 stars! It's definitely something to try and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! We had the corn beef hash and the eggs, bacon and toast with a blueberry pancake on the side!! Everything was cooked to perfection and even though it was a 30 minute wait-it was so worth it! Cam was our waiter and he was very nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for breakfast/brunch in the valley. The breakfast burrito was the first thing I tried and it was AMAZING! Had to take some home in a doggy bag because it is big. Have also tried the French toast and pancakes. Everything is so great on their menu we keep going back for more! I like that you can sip on coffee while you wait for a table and the service is excellent. Will definitely be making this a regular location of ours."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!! Food is amazing!!!! Friendliest wait staff ever!! I will def be back :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place, waiter gave us crack, well it wasn't really crack but it was worse. A pancake with bacon, chocolate chips cinnamon and who knows what else. Great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I just made it to Snooze which I'm sooooo glad that I did! I'll start with the coffee which was a bit on the light side but still was very good. The OMG French toast was just that. It was buttery and not to sweet. I had a three egg scramble that had roasted garlic, saut√©ed caramelized onions and avocado in it. I also had a bowl of fresh fruit that was spectacular. The waitress was very prompt to refill our coffee and was really kind. I loved the vibe in this restaurant. It was bright and open and there were plenty of places to sit and appreciate a very tasty breakfast! I'll be returning without a doubt. I think I'm going to try the fig French toast .... I think it had blood orange syrup... YUM!"}
{"text":"Where's the beef! Pretty much sums it up when I ordered the Reuben sandwich. There was hardly any meat on it at all! There is a picture of the Reuben sandwich on this web page. but that's not what I got at all the meat that is in the picture is about 75% more than what I actually got. As I was walking out I saw there must have been 4 other people that ordered the same sandwich and all felt bad for them. Granted the sandwiches only about 10 bucks but I would have rather pay 15 for a lot more meat and then satisfied for what I paid for. I felt like the meal was really only worth about a $1.50. I really hope that they read the reviews and correct it as this is a popular sandwich. And I would have been a lot better with a lot more meat ."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the indoor and out seating is good. The prices are a little bit high and the wait is normally long but the food is worth it. If you are in Tempe you need to try this place just make sure you bring change for the meter and bring a friend so they can sign in while you find parking."}
{"text":"I've eaten lox many times and I know that it isn't cooked. However, I was served a cooked piece of Salmon. Hmmm...guess they think minorites don't know what it looks or taste like"}
{"text":"Food is So Average. Menu has creative items but end result is average. Does well bc it is a fun atmosphere, wait staff has high energy and designed well."}
{"text":"Food was okay. We waited an hour to get a table on a Saturday morning, which was fine for us since the Gilbert Art Walk was taking place. But the food was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"One if the best breakfast place you'll find in any city.. I've been to the I've Diego and in Phoenix. I recommend it to all my friends and they have never been disappointed. The OMG French toast and the pineapple upside down pancake is the bomb... PLUS... They have good coffee!!!"}
{"text":"I should have had the pancakes.  Don't get me wrong.  The omelet I had wasn't bad.  I'm giving the place four stars after all.  The eggs and ingredients tasted fresh.  However; even for three eggs, it was pretty dense and for $9 I think access to more than three fillings (including cheese) without extra charges wouldn't be asking too much.   It did come with hash browns and toast, so that certainly does help justify the price being a dollar or two more than I would like to pay for breakfast.  The orange juice is awesome.  It tasted like the oranges were squeezed to order.  The employees are awesome.  I was alone just trying to get a quality bite to eat while my car was being worked on down the street.  I sat at the bar and the server was quick and efficient handling all the people sitting around.  He also offered everyone at least a water \"to-go\" as they paid their checks (anyone who had tea or coffee was offered that in a take out cup).  Snooze is bigger, cleaner, and more modern looking than most of the breakfast spots you're probably used to hitting up.  It's certainly worth at least a try.  But next time, I think I'm going to try the pancakes.  Or maybe the french toast."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying...that Miss Jessica, the gorgeous red head with an amazing personality is the reason why I keep coming back here! The whole staff is quite friendly and food is delicious! If you are lucky enough to get Jessica as your server than you are sure to have a great time! Thank you for the best service ever Jessica!"}
{"text":"Serious kudos for the staff here. Our waitress was so sweet and brought us a 'sample' of something my mom saw on the menu but wasn't sure if she wanted to order as her meal. The rest of the staff was friendly and the food was good! Lots of creative breakfast choices plus traditional favorites.   Obviously this place is a hit so the earlier you go the less likely you'll have to wait."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday morning expecting long wait times. We were right. Luckily there's so much new to see downtown that we took a stroll while waiting. It was about 40 minutes to be seated but then it took another 15+ until a waiter came. We had to ask the hostess if one would ever show up. Luckily for this place, the pancakes are like crack so we will keep coming back because service really was horrible. Try the pancake flight and share with a friend. Carb heaven!"}
{"text":"Half the indoor seating empty but still a 30-40 min wait???  Either they are trying to make it look like a popular night club or grossly understaffed on a Tuesday - either way, boooooo"}
{"text":"Great food but displeased by the customer service we received as a first time guest. We patiently waited the hour that we were quoted, but for one reason or the other our name got removed from the list by mistake according to the hostess. When the manager (Echo) came she basically blamed us and lied in saying that she had called for our party several times. We never got the second text message from the hostess and were also waiting right by the front door, our name was never called. Fact of the matter- I get it, you're busy...but you messed up, not me.  Echo, without even briefly looking in to the situation with the hostess, blamed us by default and didn't bother with an apology. This place lost 2 stars in my book for the less than average customer service offered by the manager Echo. Our server Stephanie was awesome, we were very well taken care of after we were finally seated."}
{"text":"The food was the greatest part of this place and possibly the only thing that would bring us back. For me anything local, farm grown or organic is a plus and this wide menu offered that. It tasted delicious.  My boyfriend had three eggs with sausage (larger than expected) and I had two Benedict one regular, one caprese. Both were delectable. If you like hash browns you would love theirs, crunchy and fresh, no need for ketchup. He ordered a screwdriver which he found was bland and I had the coffee Cosmo which was tasty.  The atmosphere was retro with 70s music, although well done there was a lack of sound barrier. There were no misters outside so eating out there wasn't an option, and waiting was a bit sweaty due to their small wait area. The bar was small with limited seating. We ended up sitting inside on the back section. We were surrounded by several kids and the room was quite loud between conversations, kids yelling and the music. Dimmed our experience. Finally our waitress, this place closes at two so I imagine she was tired when we came in at 1230. She was pleasantly concerned about our drinks but disappeared after ordering and we didn't see her till she dropped the check off after someone had come to grab our plates. The other staff seemed pleasant, quick to clean tables, efficient and they use a service that texts you for your table which is convenient. Next time we will probably do take out."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict was really good. The portions was a little small as far as I was concerned, but with a side of bacon I made it work. The speed and service needs some improvement, but I must say it was a lot better than most spots on a busy weekend. I look forward to going back soon and trying a little more items, but it will be hard to find something other than that yummy Benedict."}
{"text":"Food was really good. I had the chilies benedict super good very filling I didn't finish but washed it down with a mmm mmm mimosa. The atmosphere was very mellow good music was playing not too loud. They had very nice restroom."}
{"text":"My husband and I came down to Tempe for a weekend to have fun and meet up with his college roommate.  His roommate took us here (he always takes us the best places) when we said we wanted breakfast.  We had a nice walk from our hotel and only a short wait to get a table.  The place was hoppin'.  We ate on the patio, which was perfect as it was a beautiful day.  Our server was peppy and attentive.  They were doing a 50s beach/surfer theme, so staff was all dressed in character.    I ordered the Snooze breakfast burrito and a mimosa.  It was very flavorful and I liked that it was black beans instead of refried.  My husband got the corned beef hash breakfast and was equally impressed.  It was very hard to choose what I wanted to eat because there are so many options.  They have a breakfast pot pie that looks sinful.  There are all kinds of breakfast sammies and they have pancake platters if you want to try different flavors.  I would love to eat here again on our next Tempe trip."}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would! Snooze is quickly becoming our favorite go to breakfast stop. Even though it's over 35 minutes away it's worth the drive for the food, the vibe and the service at this location. We got there around brunch and it was busy, but we were greeted with a smile and seated right away. Our server was wonderful and gave us some time to decide while he got our drinks. I ordered a mocha while waiting. It was pretty good, but I'm more into white chocolate so not my favorite, but it was presented well and just the right size. I wanted to try something new so I went for the OMG French toast and a side of scrambled eggs, and it was just that OMG! So good! Bread wasn't soggy, fresh fruit, didnt need anything added to it, and plated beautifully. My daughter had her favorite ham, eggs over medium, hash browns and toast. Everything was perfect. We chatted with our waiter a bit and he was friendly and attentive. Bright colored chairs, light fixtures and plenty of seating makes it so fun. There is also outdoor seating if interested. When we received our check our waiter also brought us a coupon for a free pancake on our next visit. My daughter loves the cinnamon pancake so she's excited lol. Very very good! Build one in Surprise please!"}
{"text":"Saw they had chilaquiles on the menu so was excited to try them since I was told this place was ok... but Idk if they know what chilaquiles are because what came out was not that... was terrible nonetheless and so were other things on the menu"}
{"text":"I had the tacos.  They were life changing.  I really think you should order two.  But in all seriousness, this place is great.  I was here on business and belly'ed up to the bar.  The service was quick and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere for breakfast. First time here and the food was delish! The service was great as well. Server recommended some great choices and the set in portions were nice!"}
{"text":"not a great experience. the food was mediocre breakfast fare - eggs and toast and sausage but marked up 300% because it's all fair-trade organic free-range millennial horseshit. they screwed up my order, which was whatever, but the biggest disappointment was that the place promised an open bar, only to offer the most anemic, off-brand alcohol that you can find. Patron in the tequila sunrise? Grey Goose in the Bloody Mary? Johnny Walker behind the bar? when I go somewhere for an eye-opener, I want them to have a decent alcohol selection, not scrub tier no-name off brands. I got their tequila sunrise drink and it was 80% ice, which makes sense because they charge $8 for it, but the ice is hand crafted artisanal ice made by a hipster who has an ironic mustache. also, only 2 beers on tap? why does this place even have a liquor license?"}
{"text":"Tasted good, ingredients were fresh and of quality. Some people said the portions were small but my breakfast burrito was the same size as a burrito from chipotle! Prices were reasonable too. Great service!"}
{"text":"I was taken here for a birthday breakfast and I've never been to this establishment before. I had high hopes due to what I heard. When I got there the place was packed and without taking reservations we put our name down with a wait of 20-30 minutes. I didn't think that was too bad of a wait given we arrived at 9:30. We decided to look over the menu and it was nothing spectacular however I was excited to try their pancakes. Well the wait got longer and longer and eventually we got seated an hour later which to me is unacceptable. What was worse was that there were places available to sit but no server say guests there. When I ordered my hot chocolate it came in a regular glass with lots of whipped cream to were I needed a straw to even drink it but then being hot the straw bending. My food (veggie omelette and Taffy Apple pancakes where nothing out of this world. I'm glad I tried but will not return which is sad because I love breakfast!"}
{"text":"I absolute love Snooze! I go here every week, at least once. The food is great, the atmosphere is mellow, even when it's busy. The service sometimes lacks, but hey, what small business doesn't lack in service when it is busy. Nothing to get bent outta shape over, usually just a little longer of a wait for your server to come back, which is totally fine considering the food is delicious! I love the o.m.g French toast, super good and light when I don't feel like being too full to run around all day. The pancake options are awesome, and they always have a pancake of the day. My personal favorite here, is the breakfast tacos, only problem I have is they are never consistent in portion. Sometimes there's a hefty amount of filling for the taco, sometimes it lacks a little, but like I said prior, the food here makes up for that either way. I give this place 5 stars. Great food, great atmosphere, good music, can't really complain. If you go on a weekend call before you head down to get on the waiting list. Sometimes it's about an hour and half long wait. Well worth it but prepare for it, and you won't have to be bummed out, you missed out on awesome food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing truly one of the best restaurants we have been too! Everyone that works here is friendly and fast.. Jessica is our favorite person and we love Jarred the dish washer, he is so nice and funny!!! Keep up the good work snooze we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast restaurant i usually have the huevos rancheros with over medium eggs the the flying pancake are the best great food great service very clean restaurant"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Thursday and it was packed.  We sat at the bar and watch the bartender sling mimosas and lattes like crazy.  The blueberry pancakes was very good.  The pulled pork breakfast burrito was great...and HUGE.  If you can get in it's worth it."}
{"text":"When I lived in Fort Collins, CO, Snooze was my favorite place for breakfast.   Especially on a morning with that hangover from hell that would always ensue after an evening of raging through the Rio or the Drunken Monkey in Old Town. Oy vey.   So, you can imagine how ecstatic I was to see them open in Phoenix!   April's Breakfast Club UYE was here. Monica O. always does a stellar job of hosting these! Brought Mama B. and Missy F. to experience the fun.   We had 12+ folks in our group, so we sat out on the patio. Perfect weather for it.   Knew what I was getting before we even arrived: A Pancake Flight! I got the Apple, Pineapple Upsidedown and Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup. Hello, Diabetes!   Know that you can order anything half and half for the same price. So if you're stuck between one of Snooze's killer Eggs Benedict dishes or pancakes ... Live on the edge and indulge in both.   Get here early as this place gets PACKED, and fast.  Welcome to Phoenix, Snooze ... It's a joy to have a Taste of the (303) and (970) in the (480)."}
{"text":"Worth the wait!!! Amazing pancakes, omelettes, and everything in between. Service is excellent! Yes, you may have to wait a few but they get you in and out. Another keeper!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast options, super healthy, and good coffee. Can't ask for anything else!"}
{"text":"Snooze I want to like you more. More for your interesting breakfast combinations...funky vibe and breakfast cocktails. If you don't want to wait for an exorbitantly long time on the weekend. Then don't come here.  Why it is a long wait. The food is good, there Are not enough breakfast places in the valley that serve quality fair. sure. Honestly this is a management/staff problem: 1. Bussing tables is an issue that takes too long for the volume of people. 2. Empty tables.... There needs to be a system of who does and does not want to sit outside. I am seeing about 20 parties outside and 4 empty outside tables. You can't tell me that no one chose outside. We did. Still waiting. This is going to drive business down. So management of Snooze take note we will not come back until you figure this out."}
{"text":"The peanut butter pancake is hands down , one of the yummiest in the valley. One pancake is plenty yet some can argue differently. The wait time however is obnoxiously long but overall staff was great and nice patio seating for the winter months in AZ!"}
{"text":"All I can say is amazing and a must breakfast stop. The service was excellent my friend's water was never empty and my coffee mug always tired off. Our waitress was really nice and explained that even if there isn't a pancake flavor on the menu that if they have the ingredients the chefs will whip it up. Food was so good. OMG French toast was amazing covered with strawberries and toasted coconut with cream and caramel sauce. I live they offer the pancake flight because they have so many yummy sounding pancakes it would be to hard to choose just one to try. The flight let's you choose 3 flavors. Definitely will be back need to try out the rest of the menu. We sat outside on the patio which was nice and they have heaters that you can have them turn on. Inside looks warm and inviting too."}
{"text":"The location is central-ish. There's plenty of parking & shopping nearby. The restaurant itself is average. It's trying to be ~hip & people are responding- there was a 20 min wait at 10 am on a Tuesday. Although their menu was promising, the food was just alright. Coffee was weak. Pancakes were undercooked. The service was friendly but I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"A regular on my breakfast rotation.  Friendly staff, plenty of seating, and good food for a good price.  One of the very few places that has pineapple juice as a selection, which is a refreshing change from orange-apple-cranberry."}
{"text":"Great food, warm atmosphere and awesome service.  The green chili on the buro was some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"I have come to this place on five occasions and every single time I have been let down. Even before they opened and gave me the food for free. Every time there has been a problem. I don't get the whole we make our Hollandaise in the morning crap! So I am eating old sauce? For the price it should be made fresh for each plate. This isn't McDonalds is it? They make it from a make line and they can't make regular Hollandaise at any point because it \"throws off their line.\"   I'm over it, the food is tasty but the staff are always flustered or over worked, and asking for something besides directly what's in the menu is always a fiasco.  The hipster crowd looks just as good as the food but for the price I would choose a different Benedict place for sure. But if you want to be seen at a cool place this is it, but not my type."}
{"text":"Great food absolutely love that my spear need to work on breakfast drinks the Mimosa is absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! I got the OMG French toast and it was scrumptious. My BFF got the breakfast pot pie with a side cinnamon pancake that was as big as her head! Fat and fluffy. My BFF also said she loved the background music (they were playing Cake)."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!!!  I have gone multiple times and I am almost sad to love a place that is such a chain as this.  BUT IT IS AMAZING!   Every drink, every meal, every dessert here is divine.    You're silly if you don't come here.   Plain silly."}
{"text":"Can I just live here? The food is so good I could cry. I didn't know hash browns could be heavenly. All other hash browns should bow down to these. And the OMG French toast? More like OMFG French toast. I would lick the plates when I'm done if it wouldn't get me strange looks. My wife had this pile of hash browns with double bacon and cheese. I should say ex wife. She ran off with that potato bacon hussy. It's fine though, I have the French toast."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff; they all seem like they love working there & have a nice team-atmosphere. The wait can be a pain, but they offer a self-serve station with yummy free coffee which helps. Cute retro decor & decent food/selection. The portions are quite large & great for sharing."}
{"text":"The service was good, but I wasn't wowed by the pancakes. I have to come back and try the other breakfast items, and maybe change my review. I ordered the triple flight and chose 3 different pancakes because the server recommended it. I got the carrot, sweet potato and upside down pancakes. I should have ordered the quinoa oatmeal instead. Oh well! Next time, I'm going to listen to my gut instinct and get what I really want. My friends ordered the omelets , and they do look good.  I might have to try them next time."}
{"text":"Here now. Waited hour for table. Fine. Beautiful day. Waited 30 mins for food once ordered.  My daughter's chocolate chip pancake was ice cold. My upside down pancake was cold. My rye toast was waived by a toaster and cold. Waitress was very apologetic and nice. Not coming back. Too bad, really enjoy the flavors, but not worth the wait and the aggravation."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks! Causal atmosphere from the people to the food. The Tempe location is more laid back and attentive service over the Scottsdsle location."}
{"text":"I've eaten at their San Diego location.... great interior design... free coffee while you wait for seating.  Get there early on the weekends to avoid the rush.   Super friendly and fast waiting staff.... the menu has SOO many yummy combinations.  The breakfast burrito is super yummy.  Their coffee is  delicious .... and the pancakes phenomonal."}
{"text":"Snooze is right around the corner from my house and it's the only decent breakfast joint around, that being said, they stay very busy. The food is great, service decent but the wait is always outrageous. 45min-over 1 hour every time we go. The space is really cool and unique and thankfully the farmers market is open on Saturdays to keep you busy while you wait but be prepared to fight for parking and a table!"}
{"text":"The food is worth waiting for.  We ended up waiting an hour for a table so we went to the farmers market and strolled around and got back just as the pager thing buzzed. We got a nice table and had fun enjoying perusing some of the unique items on the menu. To say the least the food was very good. Pancakes for her and Corned Beef Hash and Eggs for me. Simply yummy! The guy next to us had a Shrimp dish that looked amazing. I will get it next time. He loved it. I've included a photo of it. It you don't mind the wait on good food, you will love this place."}
{"text":"If I could give a minus stars, I would. Worst service ever. Benedicts were good, pancakes were nothing special. But the bad service was the thing that outweighed any good about the place. Let me preface my comments with the fact that the restaurant was NOT busy. It took forever for our waitress to get our drinks and take our orders. When the food arrived, most were correct, but a few had errors  and were not hot. Drinks were not refilled and when one of us asked for a new cup of coffee because of a crack in the cup, the waitress got a new cup and poured the old, cold coffee into it. Who does that??!!?? I had heard service was bad here, but did not believe it could be that awful. Management needs to investigate this problem!"}
{"text":"Clean. Great atmosphere. Great menu.  Decent coffee.  We got a little overlooked waiting for our server but that happens.  Good food.  And a variety of alcoholic mid day beverages."}
{"text":"Update:  Cooperate contacted me with a VERY thoughtful and meaningful response.  I specifically appreciated commentary that everyone agreed this could have been handled better and that my review was used as a training opportunity.  Their response to my review was kind and professional... exactly what one would hope for from an establishment known to have a much better reputation then I experienced.  Thank you Snooze for reaching back out to me.    I will start off by saying that the seasonal eggs Benedict were absolutely delightful... but that is the only positive thing I can say about the whole experience.  I would have been happy to have this conversation with the manager instead of posting a negative review to yelp, but the interaction I had with the manager was already unpleasant and unapologetic so I didn't think complaining to her was going to do any good.  I ordered a water upon sitting down and 15 minutes later when I still had not gotten one I had to flag down my waitress to let her know to which there was no apology just an \"oh, I'll get you one.\"  It had been just over 20 minutes since we had ordered our food and we still had not gotten our food and so I asked our waitress to check on it... again I had to flag her down since she had not once on her own stopped by to check on us.  I saw our waitress go into the kitchen, come out without our food, print up a ticket, bring it to the manager who then came over to speak with us.   I was fully expecting an apology about our ticket getting lost in the kitchen or something to that extent, but instead she informed us that the reason our food was taking so long was because poached eggs take a long time and they have a special way of poaching there and a fresh batch was coming out and so we should have our food shortly.    It took almost another 10 minutes at this point for us to get our food and the plates were incredibly hot.  I've never had poached eggs take over 1/2 an hour and typically a super hot plate means the dish was sitting under a food warmer for quite sometime.    I understand that mistakes happen, but I would have much rather preferred an honest explanation and a simple apology.  Not once did either the manager or the waitress apologize for the wait or issues with service.   It's possible that maybe the really do have a special way of poaching that requires a 30+ minute wait on your food, but I would highly recommend letting your customers know that upfront.  That exact dish, from snooze, has been ordered before and delivered in a normal time frame.   To be fair, my friend has previously had the same waitress as today and said normally she is great.  Today, was not that."}
{"text":"Snooze is our number one choice for breakfast. I cannot get enough of their pancakes especially the pancake flight where you can sample three different pancakes. My absolute favorites are pineapple upside down pancake and the gosh OMG French toast.  This particular location is always busy and loud being close to ASU. I recommend going early really early if you want to get a table. Service is a hit or miss depending on how busy they get.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"All good things come to those who wait.And we did! For a good 35 minutes before we could lay our hands on these beauties. The Pancakes Pineapple upside down and blueberry were Amazing.Soft and fluffy just sheer perfection! I loved the vanilla creme anglaise and cinnamon butter. The french toast served with strawberries, mascarpone and maple syrup was so Yum. My omelette had caramelized onions,cherry peppers,mushrooms & cheese.(you can choose your fillings).  The only disappointment was the Hash brown it wasn't crispy at all.I'm not sure if that's the way they serve it. They also have bunch of morning cocktails i had the Mmm mm Mimosa(Snooze Sparkling, Orange Juice & Pomegranate Liqueur) that tasted more like a plain orange Mimosa.  I'm definitely going back for those pancakes.But the wait time has to be endured (they are on a first come first serve basis).  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other day and ordered the French Toast Neat. It was absolutely sensational! The whipped mascarpone cream really sealed the deal for me here, complimenting the Vermont syrup beautifully! Service was fast, early on a Thursday morning. I've driven by here several times on the weekend and each time the wait is crazy! I'm glad I finally got the chance to come in here though!"}
{"text":"Every single item was good. The cafe Negroni is a great version of the Negroni. The breakfast puff pastry was delicious. And the Benes are great. Hashbrowns are perfection when you ask for crispy."}
{"text":"Hip, fun, and delicious! This place is a family favorite with their unique(and delicious) food and beverage choices. I've tried most things on their menu, and my daughter loves their chocolate chip pancakes! The Gilbert location is always busy, so expect to wait..... but trust me, it's worth it. Never disappointed,  always satisfied when I leave Snooze. Try the Bancock Bloody Mary, it's ingredients may look a bit \"interesting\" though it's delicious and provides a fun twist on a classic. As far as the food, everything on the menu is delicious,  so there are no wrong choices. Snooze is definitely a welcome addition to our rotation of favorite eats!"}
{"text":"I was BEYOND impressed with the service here. After I placed my order, the waitress overheard me telling my boyfriend how I wish I ordered the sweet potato pancakes because they looked SO good....so my waitress was kind enough to bring me one to try! It was the service of the employees and the AMAZING food that made this experience unforgettable."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow but WHO CARES since the food is SO GOOD.  I used to go to the Snooze in Denver when I visited and have always ordered One Bella Bella, one different kind of benny(changes every time but HAVE to have at least one Benny, and share a flight of pancakes.  I usually get a pancake of the day, pineapple and a chocolate chip with white and regular chips.  So Good.  You're crazy if you don't go here just because they have an hour wait for the table. One last thing-- I HATE pancakes but i LOVE them here. :)"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and every time I've been treated perfectly and serviced with the best breakfast/brunch in the Arizona. The service is great, the food is fantastic, and the vibe perfect. I've never had a bad experience. This is a must go to place."}
{"text":"What a great place to spend a morning! Excellent food, excellent atmosphere, excellent service, and an awesome excellent view of the Gilbert Water Tower. Snooze is located on downtown where Gilbert is at its best. They are famous for their pancakes but don't so easily pass up their omelettes. Their savory options are perfection. I recommend wild mushrooms, Swiss cheese, and prosciutto ham."}
{"text":"THE BEST BREAKFAST EVER!! I am so impressed with Snooze. We were seated within 15 mins on busy 4th of July. Everything my family and I ordered was delicious and well put together. We had free refills on fresh squeezed juice and delicious coffee. Our waiter Alex was so kind, attentive, funny and efficient. The music was great, the place was super clean, the plates and silverware were retro and cool. The manager came over to talk to us about our experience and she was so nice!! She told us about how the Snooze franchise composts, recycles and repurposes everything right down to the kids crayons and soda straws. They serve cage free eggs and free range meat and all the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. Not a single complaint about Snooze. The absolute best breakfast in Phoenix, a lovely environment and awesome staff."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I randomly decided to enjoy breakfast here this morning and we are considering moving to Phoenix because it was so amazing!!!! Not only was the food and drink incredible, but Kate provided us with the best service I've had in a very long time. Being someone who manages luxury hotels for a living, I know what good service looks like, and she blew us out of the water. We are sad to have to leave the restaurant to return back to our normal lives because she made our morning brighter! Thank you for the great service and amazing experience!!!"}
{"text":"First time at Snooze.  Everyone complains about the wait but we were seated right away.  The omg French toast is amazing and the pomegranate marg was tasty! I would recommend and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot! And the bartender working that day, her name was Fanny, was super nice and went out of her way to make sure we had a great brunch experience for my girlfriends birthday. Will definitely be returning. Not to mention their Benny Duo is perfect!"}
{"text":"Ordered in breakfast this morning and it was AWESOME. We did a pancake flight w the blueberry Danish, sweet potato, and pineapple upside-down pancakes. SO tasty!! We will absolutely order them all again. We also got the snooze spuds deluxe and were ecstatic to see that they have soyrizo! The most satisfying and delicious breakfast we have had in a long time. :)"}
{"text":"Food is not bad (average breakfast food). Nice atmosphere and nice staff but way over priced. Especially for being on a college campus."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!!  Excellent service every time!! The pancakes are creative and fluffy & while they sound overly sweet they are not. We typically order one creative pancake as an appetizer for the table. That's the way to start for sure.  Then spin the wheel on the menu because it's all fresh made and sourced from quality vendors that they include on the menu. All kinds of eggs Benedict which are another favorite of so many.   This has quickly become a family favorite! Thanks Snooze for being there!"}
{"text":"So - love this place, but definitely go to the Gilbert location.  Waitress was too busy to refill any drinks or check on us.  Not because the restaurant was busy, she was \"too busy.\"  Heard other tables complaining too.  Food was good, but not as good as the Gilbert location.  My son had the same meal - said it wasn't as good - but not bad."}
{"text":"Best bacon ever.  That should be enough.  But if it's not - great coffee, eggs that were delectable.  Long wait, but so worth it.  Staff awesome.  Hostess hilarious.  And....  Best bacon ever."}
{"text":"First time here, won't be the last. Food was delicious and the eggs Benny duo was the beez knees.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Very little food for the high prices. Free coffee while you wait, but then they offer to \"switch out your mug\" without saying that you'll be charged for it."}
{"text":"Wow....just wow!! After hiking \"A\" mountain, we stopped in for a fabulous breakfast....everything was delicious. We shared (as good friends do) corn beef hash, iced coffee, upside down pineapple pancake with cinnamon butter....I'm trying to figure out how to get there tomorrow! (Without hiking the mountain!) ;)"}

{"text":"Holy crap, 70 min from requesting a table till food served. The food and service was good. But maybe I won't pick Saturday to have breakfast here."}
{"text":"I was in town for business at ASU and breakfast is my thing. Love it. Want it. It makes me happy. So my coworker suggested this local spot. It was amazing! I only wish there was a location by me in California. First- the ambiance was adorable. We sat outside and enjoyed the AZ heat. Its a great locale on the busy downtown street, so great vibe. There is a parking garage right next door so that's fab. Second- the service was spot on. The girls look to be college students who are as sweet as attentive. Third- the coffee. I ordered an Americano and it was perfection. Came in a sweet, yellow cup, which any coffee lover can appreciate an original, good mug. Fourth- the food. Oh the food!! Large portions and this was by far the best breakfast burrito I have had. Eggs, hash browns, veggies, and green salsa all rolled into a perfect burrito. Love this place. Will come back when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love this place ! Yes the wait is long but I feel that it's worth it. I went here today for my moms birthday and she's the pickiest eater ever and she enjoyed it. I got the B.E.A.T sandwich and the bacon is thick cut bacon !"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, and friendly people. Their pancakes are amazing and if you like hash browns you have to try their famous 'tower'"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Nice food, good variety depending on your mood. If you feel like eating a little clean they have your back covered. I had a Egg Whites Fritata and love it! Next time I want to try their beverages it seemed delicious ."}
{"text":"Scrumptious as always, and our server, Dee could not have been any more charming! The whole menu rocks (as do the bloody Mary's and birthday treats but my personal favorites are the Benedicts! You can get a duo with 2 of your faves! So bomb."}
{"text":"Nothing special. It's all hyped up but does not deliver on the hype small portions and crowded for reasons I don't understand because it's only one step up from McDonald's breakfast and cost three times as much."}
{"text":"Holy crap, best breakfast ever!!!!  Crowded and insane wait but it's worth it.  Tried to beat the \"church\" crowd but not a chance.  All that tells ya is it's bomb!"}
{"text":"Hats off to the folks at Snooze!  The food, service and atmosphere are spot on.  My favorite dish here is the Caprese Eggs Benedict.  I get that almost everytime I am here.  The orange juice is fresh squeezed and very good.  I am not a huge fan of the coffee here, but that is the only thing.  Our server sent over a Pineapple Cream pancake which sounded gross, but was ABSOLUTELY DELICOUS! The food is consistent and great, the service is very good all the time.  Be careful if you come on a weekend morning, try to get there right when they open or be prepared to wait an hour or more!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite breakfast spot! The food is always spot on and I never get tired of ordering the same thing or mixing it up. I usually order the flight of pancakes with a chocolate chip, blueberry danish, and pineapple upside down pancake or the Chilaquiles Benedict. To be honest I have had all of the Benedicts  and they never disappoint.   The customer service is top notch, my family has always been well taken care of and we have even been gifted free pancakes. (The best is the pineapple upside down pancake)   There is usually a wait but they take your number and then text you when your table is ready. While you wait you can go browse at Nordstrom Rack next door, Paper Source or one of the many surrounding stores. Trust me the wait it worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times for lunch and breakfast. If you get there early it's not too loud,  but lunch is a different story. Since it's design is open (ceiling is exposed) the sound carries and I found myself nearly yelling to my husband who was directly in front of me. Mostly the food is good,  but it depends on the chef /cook of the day, and who you get for service...how can you mess up pancakes? Really? It just seems that it's quality and aesthetics are inconsistent.  We haven't been back; there are other restaurants close by that are consistently excellent."}
{"text":"The food and service is good, but the kitchen is so slow. It took 50 minutes to be seated and 45 minutes for our food to arrive. I asked for a second order of fruit  (which obviously does not have to be cooked or preped) for my 2 year old and it took over 30 minutes. We sent it back because we were done eating and were paying the check!"}
{"text":"Breakfast pot pie was the best!! 6 friends and I and our pups sat on the patio and they are very dog friendly and even provided water for the dogs!! Love this place and would recommend to anyone who loves good breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place for weekend brunch. It is very cozy place and enjoy spending the morning here with my mom. Server ways amazing and very friendly being that it was our first time. He answer all of our questions and made some great recommendation. I had the breakfast tacos and will have them again when I come back."}
{"text":"One disappointing moment after another.   Starting with putting our name on the list had to confirm 3 times we were a party of 4. We get called and the hostess tried to sit us at a table for two. We are left standing there waiting while she figures it out.   We get a table make our drink orders. My husband orders a soda and he's brought a coffee. Not a big deal but a big sign of what's ahead. Soda refills came easily but had to pretty much beg for a coffee refill.  Next up we order breakfast and it arrives and my 6 year old son's order was wrong. Something that should be fixed very quickly instead took about 20 minutes for his correct order to come out. But to make it better our waiter comes over 3 times to say it's not his fault and the manager tells us it's delayed because she had people not want to come to work because of the PF Chang marathon. None of this is my problem.  The rest of us had correct orders but none of it was hot. Not a single thing that hit out table was warm.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Had a business breakfast here. Very busy but efficient service. Food is very good. Had the breakfast pot pie w poached eggs. Prepared well and so tasty!! The entire group enjoyed it very much. Would definitely return. Gets a big mix of locals, tourists and business people. Expect s short wait but they get you in quickly.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious, creative food right smack dab in the middle of the asu campus. If you are a breakfast person, this place will not disappoint. I had the breakfast pot pie and it was delicious albeit a little small. It consisted of a flaky puff pastry smothered in homemade rosemary sausage gravy topped with an egg complete with hash browns which they serve as a solid chunk which is kinda unique. I also tried some of the sweet breakfasts like pineapple upside down pancakes which are killer. 4 stars?  Well, we waited a long time for our seat, I suspect you will too..."}
{"text":"What a great place! Amazing food! Christy and Cory were the friendliest servers ever! Great menu! Delicious food!"}
{"text":"Normally, i won't wait 60 minutes for a breakfast, but Snooze is worth waiting for. I had the pot pie (bias alert: I love all things with pot pie in the title) and loved their take on it.  Light puff pastry, delicious gravy, topped by a perfectly prepared egg over medium. My wife had the chilaquiles, which were amazing, and we shared the pancake of the day - blueberry! Oh, and I shouldn't forget to mention the Bloody Mary. Not my favorite, but worth a try. Finally, service is great and the atmosphere is perfect. Try sitting at the bar facing squaw peak."}
{"text":"I had the Sandwich I Am and enjoyed every single bite. Good portion and flavorful.  Hubby has the Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes and said it was just ok. He prefers Butters breakfast (located in Scottsdale) over Snooze.  Our server did not come to table often enough. We had to waive to get her attention. At a place so busy I would assume they would want to turnover the tables quick so it would make sense to come to table often to check up on guests.   Additional information: We came around 1030AM on a Sunday and street parking was easy to find. The wait was about 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Long wait but boy is it worth it. The service was perfect, the food left my boyfriend and I craving it for weeks. First time we sat on the patio and enjoyed the weather. Perfect spot for a mimosa or bloody Mary and brunch. Second time we waited for an hour and sat near the bathrooms, which awkwardly enough have a bit of a view to the men's room."}
{"text":"Pineapple upside down PANCAKES ARE THE BESTEST EVER!!! I'm from Colorado too, so I know how involved they are with charity and volunteer work in their area. Great establishment! I usually do one of two things. The burrito, so similar to a chimichanga. The Chilaqiles Benedict are pretty darn good.  This week was national pancake day, so I decided to go to snooze. They had a portion of their pancake sales going to a hospital charity so I loaded up and went a bit out of my comfort zone. I ordered the Spud Deluxe and THREE different pancakes ( a portion of each pancake went to a hospital charity) For my pancakes I chose the Velvet(I'm not a chocolate fan but just sounded good) second I chose a banana glaze, walnut, and sweet creme cheese type of pancake( just the sound of the name creme cheese makes me eek cause I am big on cream but it was still good.) to finish it off as a dessert I made my last pancake are the PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE. I love those pancakes. For my spud deluxe I added Avocado, an egg, and slow roasted pork. It was both delicious and large in portion. Being from Colorado I LOVE everything about this place. An even though there is always a wait, even though they're not as busy as their Colorado locations I still love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had eaten here once before and enjoyed it. This visit, however, was even better! We met a friend for brunch at 9:45 on this Saturday morning.  The place was busy and we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. No worries, they have cocktails both at their inside bar and on their covered front patio. We ordered up 3 of their Moscow Mules and sipped them in the shade on the patio while we chatted. Theirs are super tasty with the addition of a little grapefruit juice. We were seated in slightly under 45 minutes and had the good fortune of being served by Madison. She was friendly, attentive and had a great sense of humor. We gave her the new nickname of \"Ninja Kitty\" so be sure to call her that if you are lucky enough to be seated at one of her tables. We had such a great time with her she bestowed a couple of VERY nice perks on us. I'm not saying what, other than a free sample of their truly yummy Pineapple Upside Down pancake. We all thought it was so good and not as sweet as the name sounds.  I ordered the Egg White Frittata which was absolute savory deliciousness. Hubby ordered the Ham Benny and subbed the pork belly bacon for the ham. (They are happy to make substitutions!) He said it was awesome. Our friend ordered the Corned Beef Hash and she loved it so much she nearly cried!  Manager Leah came by at the end and gave us our finale special surprise. So sweet!  See you girls again soon!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, nothing too special. It's very expensive honestly, but it has a nice atmosphere and it's something new for Tempe. I would recommend the pancake flight, which is three mini pancakes of all their pancake choices, so it's a great way to try new things!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue! I have been going to Snooze in Gilbert AZ for years now, it's my favorite breakfast/brunch spot in the east valley. Good food, fun atmosphere, great place! What really makes Snooze different than most restaurants though, is it's staff. This Snooze in particular just has some amazing people working there. Page, in particular, is amazing! Attentive, nice, down to earth, my girls and I look forward to going in just to sit with Page! Snooze is truly lucky to have somebody who is as efficient, kind and somebody as likable as Page. My daughters run up and hug her when they see her. The fact that she has taken the time to develop those types of relationships in a restaurant as busy as Snooze, says a lot about how much she cares."}
{"text":"Breakfast is one of my favorite meals (let's be honest, there isn't a meal I dislike...) and Snooze does it right! The atmosphere is fantastic and they have a lot of indoor and outdoor seating options. The menu is fairly extensive and I'm pretty sure that even a picky eater could find something they like.   One thing to be aware of is parking. There really isn't any close parking (limited street parking and there are nearby garages), but the food makes up for it.  I highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Snooze is delicious! Super friendly staff, great service, amazing food & coffee, good prices, just be prepared for a small wait."}
{"text":"After agreeing to the $3.50 charge to upgrade toast to a gluten free pancake, the pancake showed up with hair cooked into in. Never going back."}
{"text":"We went early in the morning (before 8:00 A.M.) as to avoid the long waits you hear of when going to Snooze. That was a good idea, we were seated right away.   Our server, Michael, was great. He was fun and friendly, very thorough in answering our questions, and very knowledgeable of the menu. He continued to fill our waters and ask if he could get us anything even after we had finished eating. I will definitely look for him next time we eat at Snooze.  The food was great! If you get something from the sweet utopia section, be prepared! It is seriously sweet! That being said, it is sensational! We got the Pancake of the day to try, and between the four of us, it was plenty as a sweet treat!  We really did not have anything bad or negative. By the time we were leaving there was a long wait, so I would recommend going early as possible if you do not like to wait, however, it is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"We arrived at 12:30 on a Saturday and expected to have a wait-it was 30 minutes, 10 minutes for the waiter and 20-25 minutes for the food to come out.  Didn't expect to make it an afternoon outing! Food was amazing; HOWEVER, the sound in the place was at a level my family had to yell to talk.  Remember how it is when you go to a concert? Same thing...    The waiter got our choice wrong and I think it was because he didn't hear the order in the first place!  In addition to the loudness in the restaurant, they had the music turned up so it sounded like a base boom box.  We left and literally my husband and I had headaches and tense necks!    Moral of the story:  even when there is amazing food, you should never have to hurry to eat it to get out of the restaurant. Especially when it was $48.00."}
{"text":"Best breakfast In town. I love this place and love the fun light vibe I get everytime I go. Love it and the food!"}
{"text":"Over rated pancakes.  Not worth the wait.   Come on a day that's not busy and enjoy their corned beef hash.    Every thing else is ordinary."}
{"text":"I had the snooze classic with the chicken sausage, my love had the duo bennys, one chili verde and one chilaquiles. Totally awesome! Great service and the place was packed! Add in the complimentary molten chocolate lava pancake. this place is a must stop!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Snooze early on weekdays as to avoid crowds so I can't complain about wait times and spotty service. I've had both the corned beef hash and Chile Verde eggs Benedict. Both were delicious. I tend to choose savory options, but will have to try their pancakes a French toast in the future."}
{"text":"Always worth the wait. Few places are good enough for a 45 minute to an hour wait, but Snooze is! I have loved every item I've tried. The staff at this location is always friendly and attentive. Get a pancake to share before your main course; it's like a reverse dessert!"}
{"text":"Very good place. Prepare to wait for a table. But can't go wrong with the breakfast tacos and pancake of the day. Food's not even expensive."}
{"text":"I think I am in love with Snooze! The food, well, it will not fail you. The Drinks, they are excellent! The Service...we always sit at the bar, (its a coofee/alcohol bar with killer breakfast margaritas) so it's always good. We love the atmosphere, and the pineapple upsidedown pancakes are stupid good, the condensed syrup stuff and sweet butter OMG!...So are their breakfast tacos...so awesome due to the amazing thick cut bacoon and this green sauce.   The wait can suck...but that is only because this place is so good :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times since it opened and found the service to be great and the belly bacon always delicious. The one thing that always bugged me though is I've always hated the hash browns molded into a tour. Well today, while doing breakfast with some friends, the waiter let us know we could get the hash browns mashed down and fried crispy. i didn't get any but some of my friends did and they are everything a breakfast hash brown should be, flattened out and crispy all over. I asked if this was a new thing and the wait person told me no, it was always available and not listed so you have to ask for it.  Well Snooze, knowing that I can get my hash browns the way I want them kicks you up a star. In addition, it was my first time eating at the outside tables and wow, it was so nice outside, what a great way to start the day."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Yes. This place is amazing! We had the breakfast burrito and pineapple upside down pancakes soo delight. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I'd been to their locations in Denver before they opened here in Gilbert, and I was a fan of them there. Unabashedly hipsteresque, but that shouldn't stop you from stopping by. Their food is damned good, and even when they're a little busy they have plenty of seating to accommodate crowds. Their portions are a little on the smaller side but that wasn't a problem for me- my meal was large enough to eat in one sitting and not feel horrible, but not really large enough to eat half of and take the rest home.   Anyhow, this is a great place for breakfast or an early lunch."}
{"text":"The best service I have had at a Snooze yet, besides the one in downtown San Diego. I was waiting for my party to arrive (sitting there 9mo pregnant and super uncomfortable) trying to decide what I wanted before they got there. I was at the bar and was served water right away and offered help. I then wanted to know the pancake of the day and after the most pleasant interaction with Roman(?), pregnancy brain is taking over and I hope that is his name, I was server a flight size of that exact pancake in question! Which was amazing by the way!!! (Filled with granola and topped with yogurt and strawberries) they saved the outside table I had requested until my party arrived and there is even bags, ping pong, and a kids chalk board which made my life so easy having my 2 year old distracted! Thank you Snooze, Gilbert! I live in Scottsdale but will make the drive to your location anytime i am headed to a Snooze!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Snooze as soon as it opened its Biltmore location, so I was over the moon when they came to Tempe! This location is just as good as its Phoenix sibling, and the wait was not as long. My group of five arrived at 9 am, and we were immediately seated. I guess all the college kids were still in bed. You snooze, you lose! LOL. The place had a considerable line by the time we left around 10:30 am. The menu is solid; pancakes, eggs benedict, and breakfast sandwiches that will blow your mind. This is my favorite morning restaurant, and I can't wait for the Gilbert spot to open!!!"}
{"text":"I still love this place! Sadly, my beloved Blueberry Danish pancake is gone (it was seasonal), but they've added a Molten Chocolate Lava pancake, and it is amazing!!! I always clean my plate when I'm here. The wait time can be super long, but it's worth it!!! I'll be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite brunch spot! The eggs Benedict are always perfect, lots of different options for Benny's and they're all amazing!"}
{"text":"I dont understand what the hype is all about. We waited an hour Saturday around 10:30am. It was packed. We sat outside (after waiting for an hour outside) in the sun. Its too hot to have tables outside in the sun with no misters. We were able to sit half way in the shade after a while, but still didnt help with the heat. Service was mediocre, ran out of water a few times and had to flag people down for re-fills, ordered the omelette..... nothing but grease. Hash browns had no taste to them at all....... just really not worth the hype or the wait. I think its just busy because its a newer place in old town Gilbert. Dont let it fool you, honestly if you are going to wait an hour, it should be worth it!"}
{"text":"Super busy, full of kids, loud music, the servers did not fill up my coffee or water... I also paid EIGHT, yes eight, dollars for a bowl of quinoa and oatmeal. I expected a large bowl and honestly it was the equivalent of one of those oatmeal packets.  I have actually been to other Snooze locations, this fell to the bottom of that list pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Breakfast does not get better than this! The decor has such a funky fun vibe and the service is outstanding! Oh my goodness the food is simply fabulous! The menu is awesome and everything is delusions! Anyone not coming here is really missing out! We are definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Today my boyfriend and I split the corned beef hash and a pancake flight. Hash was delicious, just a little greasy and I wish there were more hash browns in the mix. Pancake flight was fun, and there are so many unique flavors! We got the peanut butter cup, bourbon pumpkin, and sweet potato. Sweet potato was to die for, light and moist with just a hint of sweetness - perfect. Pumpkin was also great with a tasty glaze. The chocolate pb one was just too sweet for me; delicious but I am just not a big fan of super sweet breakfasts. All around tasty breakfast with reasonable prices and unique menu items."}
{"text":"I love this place. A lot. The only negative thing I could say is it's hard to choose something off the menu because it all looks good.  There has been a wait every time I've been but never more than 30 min for 2 and they have a nice setup where you can sit and relax on the patio, play ping-pong, or play bags while you wait. The bar is also first come first serve if you happen to get lucky and spot someone leaving.  Starting with drinks, they have some really interesting sounding morning cocktails and fancy coffee drinks but so far I've just tried mimosas (grapefruit & orange) because they're fresh squeezed and you can't go wrong with a mimosa for brunch. They also have free coffee set up near the host stand to drink while you're waiting for a table.  The food is amazing. I've tried the Harvest Benedict. So good! I also got the Sandwich I Am with a pear pancake instead of the hashbrowns (you can sub for like $3 I think) and I would definitely recommend both of those as well."}
{"text":"I had gone to Snooze when I lived in Denver, so I pretty much knew what to expect...very good breakfast spot 5 min from home...been a few times, had the pancake flight one time the loaded French Toast another time.  Big menu, lots of choices...as a side, some of the better bacon I've had locally.  I'd read about the long waits, but by going at 6:30 on weekdays, there was no wait.   Definitely among the better Phoenix breakfast joints, I'd rank it up there with my favorites--Scramble and Matt's Big Breakfast."}
{"text":"We come here anther between 3-10 times a year for the past few years. Great breakfast place! Get the eggs Benedict! All the options are delicious. Fresh, tasty, and good quality food!"}
{"text":"It takes an hour to get seated here but I still always go back!! I love all of the Snooze locations and they each deserve their own 5 star rating. On weekends, you can check out the farmers market while you wait for a table. They also have cornhole and games out back. The OMG French Toast is the best french toast EVER. The brioche one is great too. I love all of their eggs, and recommend getting a few savory brunches as a group and splitting the sweet options as a table."}
{"text":"Excellent cup of coffee = five stars!!!  However the food was just as good.  Bacon not overly salty, egg poached perfectly, service rocked!  Definitely add this your list of breakfast places!"}
{"text":"I decided to go here with a group of my friends from school because I'd heard such great things about it. Pretty good place overall. Service was eh as the waitress was taking a little too long to really do anything, especially considering the flow of people coming in had pretty much seized. My group of friends and I had just come in as the rush was dying down, so after waiting about forty minutes to get seated we were starving. I'm a huge coffee drinker, so I got the iced coffee. Very good taste overall. I had been craving potatoes, so I got the dish on the menu that was literally a bowl of hash browns and you could put anything into it. When I got my meal, it was a nice portion, but it was very bland. It wouldn't have been much trouble to salt the potatoes before putting them in the bowl. Really wish I would have gotten the eggs benedict instead.  Overall, it was okay, but I wouldn't drive the thirty minutes it took me to go there again."}
{"text":"Let's start with what they are good at... the food us outstanding! Great menu, wonderful portion size and a fair price. The decor is awesome! Great layout, design etc.  However, The wait on weekends is very long.  The staff, organization and management are very poor. I have gone several times on weekends and watch empty tables for up to five minutes and the table has yet to be cleared. Once cleared and re-set, the table sits empty for several more minutes before they get around to sitting customers.  And I'm not talking about one table but four or five tables just sitting there while customers are outside in the heat waiting.  So frustrating!   You can tell the staff and management are not well trained!"}
{"text":"Wife and I discovered this restaurant because they serve gluten free pancakes.  The pancakes are hands down the best gluten free pancakes we've ever eaten. The variety and flavors make for interesting combinations and they aren't shy about sending free 'samples' to your table.  I put sample in quotes because it's often a full size pancake.    If the food wasn't enough the staff at snooze are friendly and attentive.  I've never had an issue which wasn't remedied immediately and to my complete satisfaction.  In a few short months we've gotten to know many of the servers and they us and it's always a pleasure to go there, like visiting extended family.    I can not recommend this place enough.  One word of caution, especially on weekends, this place is very popular, an hour wait is not uncommon, though first come first serve bar service ameliorates that some.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times now and every time I have had great service and very tasty food. The pancakes are my desert. They have pineapple upside pancakes, cinnamon roll pancakes and a coyote others that are amazing. This is my new favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"The Chilaquiles Benedict is the bomb dot com ~ must try!   TIP: I would recommend getting here before 8:00am on the weekends otherwise you will wait 45 minutes +"}
{"text":"This is a really great breakfast/brunch spot in the heart of ASU. If there is a wait...trust me...you need to wait. From start to finish the service and food are phenomenal. Tori and Adrienne at the bar are awesome and friendly. We got complimentary samples of hot chocolate, as well an amazing creation called the pineapple upside down pancake. This is seriously the best pancake I've ever had. Oozing with cinnamon butter and pineapple sauce and perfectly crisp. And that wasn't even the food we ordered! I had the Winter Harvest Benny Benedict. Nice twist on a regular old Benedict. It's a polenta base with Brussels sprouts. Tasted amaze balls! And the hash browns that came with it were just as good. Start to finish, from the friendly service, fun decor, and the food is seriously on point. Do yourself a favor and forget whatever place you eat brunch at and go here. I'm stoked to return for all the goodness. Snooze makes me want to be in a continual food coma. YUUUM!!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast joint! Cool atmosphere and wonderful menu! Nice place for a brunch with the house memos or bloody mary. Have been impressed with everything we have tried so far."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 4/5 Happiness - 5/5  I don't know how anybody could argue that this place is not the best. My out-of-town relatives demand to be brought here when they come. There is always a line, even in well-over-100 degree heat. The biggest flaw? The place simply needs to be bigger.  The eggs are always perfectly cooked and there are far more options than the typical bacon and sausage for your meats. As a non-pork eater, I almost weep with joy that I can get some high-quality soyrizo in my huevos rancheros and easily the best chicken breakfast sausage I have ever had in my omelets. The pancakes are very delicious and they have new ones weekly. The one we just tried? Dark chocolate, banana chip with a walnut crumble topping. My personal favorites are the sweet potato, blueberry and chocolate chip. I'm not a pancake guy, but the options are so plentiful and diverse, even I have to occasionally order them.   I will admit that the hash browns and bloody marys are a bit lacking. The hash brown stack they give you are always a bit wet and while they look good, lack any crunch or flavor. It is total empty calories in my mind - I'd rather have the fruit or another pancake. The bloody marys are always on the more watery side and I feel like they never get the balance right. Their other alcoholic drinks are far better, particularly the mayan mocha, which is spiked with some vodka.   Finally, kids love this place. There are often people making balloon animals for the little ones, and a ping pong table for the older kids."}
{"text":"My friend and I came for a 9:00 a.m. breakfast. It was nice weather so we sat outside. The restaurant was not too crowded but busy enough. Our server Tiffers was great, very attentive.  My friend had coffee and the Snooze Breakfast Burrito (filled with scrambled eggs, hash browns, house black beans, cheddar & jack cheese, topped with green chili salsa). I had an ice tea and the Huevos Rancheros  (corn tortillas layered with black beans, jack cheese, ranchero sauce, three eggs any style, and pico de gallo).   The Racheros was excellent. The Burrito was very room temperature to cool inside. When brought to the attention of Tiffers, it was reorder, and fairly quickly resolved with many apologies and comped beverages.  Atmosphere nice with patio seating. Food and Service good."}
{"text":"I went to Snooze yesterday for breakfast at 10:30 a.m. off the recommendation of a friend who said \"the Benedict and Corned Beef Hash are to die for\". The location, right next to Postino,  same decor, same beautiful outdoor patio seating. We were greeted and seated right away. Our drink order was taken. We waited a bit for the waitress to take our order, she seemed very interested in socializing with the other tables.  Our order was finally taken, we ordered Iced Tea, Iced Vanilla Latte, Corned Beef Hash (Snooze's signature shredded hash mixed with artisan corned beef, caramelized poblanos and onions. Topped with two eggs your style & toast or tortillas), and Ham Benedict III (The classic evolved with our signature English muffin topped with shaved hickory smoked ham, perfectly poached cage free eggs and smoked cheddar hollandaise).  The food came, couldn't ask for anything better, the Benedict was perfectly done, my Corned Beef Hash was fantastic, refills of my Iced Tea was flowing. Excellent breakfast foods, ordering service could of been a little faster, but all in all I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting with a friend for breakfast. I have to say the eggs Benedict are the bomb!!! They are a must get. As in previous reviews you can mix match and customize your breakfast. Being our first time there we decided to sample a couple of items and share. We started with the eggs Benedict one original and the green chile. The green chile was on a bed of pulled pork that had an amazing flavor. They are a must try. My friend who had the original said it was the best egg Benedict she ever had. Next we did the flight of pancakes. Upside down pineapple, candied Apple, and plain. I tried the pineapple and was not too impressed, but I am not a pineapple person. The candied Apple was phenomenal for me. My friend preferred the pineapple one over Apple. So it's a matter of preference. As for plain I can't give an opinion because I didn't try it. But I assume from all the other food it would have been good.  Now on service I wish I knew the servers name because she was amazing. We asked her what she would recommend since it was our first time. She took the time to explain the menu and showed us how we could customize.  She was friendly warm and conversational. She was on top of the service. At the end of the meal she even asked us if we would come back to see her tomorrow. Which made us feel welcomed. Although I wish I could eat there daily it is out of my area, but I will definitely visit regularly.  To the anonymous server thank you for an awesome experience.  To management you have a great server. Hopefully she will be there the next time we visit. I wish I would have left a manager compliment."}
{"text":"Definitely a hot spot for breakfast or brunch.  This place has a very urban/contemporary fits in with the college crowd feel.    As soon as you walk in, everything is vibrant from the decor to the friendly staff.  Everyone was exceptional from a service stand point.   They have so many speciality cocktails and while I didn't get to try one this time around they are definitely in my radar for next time.  That's right....there will most certainly be a next time!!!!   I ordered the \"OMG French Toast\" and they did pack quite the flavor punch.   They come with mascarpone butter and a Carmel syrup glaze tops with fresh strawberries and coconut shavings.  While the serving wasn't large it was just right since towards the end of the meal it was getting almost too sweet too sugary.  So be warned of your not big into sweet stuff.      Prices are a tad on the higher side, but nothing that was a deal breaker. You can at least tell that the increase in cost goes to fresh ingredients and excellent attention to detail in the little things.    I hear they might be opening one in downtown Gilbert and can't wait as that's a little closer for me, but either way I will be coming back to taste other delightful items on the menu and throwback some cocktails!!! SUNDAY FUNDAY DONE RIGHT!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is spot on at this crazy busy place. It's unbelievable. The food and drink variety runs from comfy to healthy and light. I think I can make this a (at least a) weekly habit. Keep up the awesome work!!"}
{"text":"Wow! No one is snoozing back in the kitchen of this place! The craziest eggs benedict I've ever had. Really good too! I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting over a 40 min. for take-out, on a weekday in October. Slowest kitchen in the valley. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot! There was about a 45 minute wait on a Friday morning. Luckily my friends I went during Gilberts Farmers Market which was steps away from the restaurant. I love that the host was able to shoot me a text when the table so we were able to stroll through the Farmers Market and kill some time.   The food at Snooze Am is as good as you see in the pictures. My husband and I split a few dishes and I'm not sure which one is my favorite (added pictures).  The servers were polite and pretty quick too.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What more can I add to all the other reviews? I originally went to Snooze in San Diego (check out my review!) so when I saw that they came to Phoenix I had to try them, of course.  Snooze is an excellent place for an amazing breakfast. I always get a half order of the eggs benedict and then share a flight of pancakes because o.m.g. they're amazing! The pineapple upside down pancake...wow....could there a better pancake? NO! But the chocolate chip comes in right behind it. Also what I love are their hash browns because unlike other restaurants Snooze actually seasons their hash browns wonderfully. I generally hate hash browns and avoid getting them but at Snooze I have to have them! You can order anything and won't be disappointed. Service is always great and the place is really comfortable and clean. This place is a winner for sure! Oh! And if you're going for someone's birthday breakfast, quietly tell your server and he'll bring out a birthday festive pancake with a candle! Very cool."}
{"text":"First time going, after hearing great things. Now I can confirm that everything was wonderful. Went for friend's birthday, they gave us the pineapple upside down pancake free-- which was amazing and fresh. The service was also wonderful. Our server was very well knowledged, kind, and efficient. A man who appeared to be manager, also checked in and was very nice and helpful. The eggs Benedict was unique and tasty. The items we had on the menu to eat and drink were all very good. This will now be a frequent breakfast spot for me and friends!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:00 AM on Sunday 7/26.  Waited 5 minutes just to reach the hostess stand to put our name in.  They informed us of a 75-90+min wait for a 2 top.  Half the tables were empty and there were more people standing around inside waiting than seated eating. Sadly, we left. Not worth that kind of wait for hit and miss reviews from our friends."}
{"text":"Had the pancake flight which was amazing. My favorite was the sweet potato pancake. They have the most amazing Benedict's yum. Try the Bella Bella it's to die for with prociutto and balsamic reduction. Definitely best Benedict in town!"}
{"text":"Great menu and food.  Nice atmosphere once seated.  The only complaint I have with this place is the long lines and no where to sit while waiting in the hot sun  Awesome food and definitely will be back.  Just earlier before the long line starts up.."}
{"text":"Went to Snooze for the first time the other day.  I really like the decor in the place.  It is cute a place.  When we came in the were just 2 of us and we were greeted right away.  There were quite a few tables open and the hostess sat us a really large center table.  It was way too big for two people.  I guess we should have just asked for a different table.  Our waitress took our order and she was nice but definitely over friendly in any way.  I ordered the breakfast pot pie with a side of sausage.  The meal came in an acceptable time and the pot pie was just as described other than the fact the gravy had barely any sausage in it.  The extra sausage I ordered was one very small patty.  The pot pie was extremely bland.  Just lacking in flavor.  The sausage I ordered was what I thought was going to be 1.75 extra.  When we got the bill we were charged 3.75 extra.  Now on the menu there is a spot on the left that says extras or something to the that effect. It is located right below the area I ordered from. I thought that meant if you wanted a piece of sausage or some bacon it would only be 1.75.   I ended up getting the waitress's attention and asked by I was being charged so much for a tiny piece of sausage.  She explained the extra full pieces of sausage and bacon you order are on an entire other area of the menu.  The 1.75 option is just a few crumbles extra on your meal.  I explained how misleading that was and overpriced it was and she agreed.  She did get the manager to adjust the price.  I just do not feel the food was good enough to justify the price.  If you want breakfast that tastes better and way less money there are about 20 options within 2 miles of this place.  I doubt I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful morning-open air Snooze. Love the staff and the vibe for Duck / Sparky matchup later!"}
{"text":"Totally and completely LOVE it!! The staff, hospitality and the FOOD is phenomenal. It's family friendly, dog friendly and overall a great place to be. I am definitely coming back!!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious! The staff were all so friendly and appeared happy! I had the corned beef and it's the best Ive had! Not to mention the pineapple upside down cake pancakes!! Even bought a pack of their coffee to go! Can't wait to eat here again next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"You will want to take a snooze if you fill up on one of these delicious pancake flights and eat yourself into a coma. I came for lunch and ordered breakfast here a few times. They are only open till 2:30 so breakfast/brunch is all they do and they do it really well.  I have had: -The B.E.A.T Sandwich  - Tender Belly Bacon, fried egg, arugula and tomato with bacon-tomato aioli on a ciabatta roll.   -Sandwich I Am - Pretzel Roll!!!! pretzel roll filled with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and a sausage patty, with cheddar hollandaise & house hash browns.  Both of these were delicious. I love the Tempe location and I am glad to have another place to put in to my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"So I've been to Snooze enough times to finally write a review.  I've been to this location once, Town & Country (Camelback's) location a number of times, San Diego, and even the location in Colorado where it first originated.  I'm giving some love to this one since it's not saturated with 500+ or 2000+ or even 3000+ (San Diego) reviews yet.  That 3000+ speaks volume.  But I can say that my review for all the Snooze locations have been pretty even across the board in terms of quality in the making and creations of such deliciousness!  The service for me (in all locations) have been wonderful for such a busy breakfast hang out spot.  Luckily, they do provide complimentary coffee to their awaiting hangry customers.  You will wait and that's no surprise!  However, the bar does provide fist-come-first-serve seating.  Grab away, but try not to hoover over the people still trying to enjoy their brunch or company.    I'll try to remember what I've devoured in lump sum.  I'll start with my favorite off the savory.  I love their Benedicts!  Being indecisive at times, they do give you the Benny Duo option, which means half of one choice and half of another.  I have tried them all! Yes all!  I usually would go for the most interesting (versus common) Benedict.  The Chile Verde Benedict (pulled pork) is probably my favorite for more of a daring meaty option.  It's not spicy, which is good for me.  And if you're just not feeling for something heavy, I would definitely recommend the Caprese Benedict (heirloom tomatoes and mozzarella).  Very light and refreshing for a Benedict, yet full of flavor! Something about that Balsamic reduction brings it together!  But really, any choice you can't go wrong with.  If you didn't like it, my bad.  Don't be picky!   Moving on, the Quinoa Porridge!  Yes!  As strange as it sounds, it's actually pretty good to me.  Don't know what Quinoa is?  Then that means you should try it once.  It looks like oatmeal from afar mixed in with oats.  Texture is similar to oatmeal.  It's got some sweetness of pecans, lemon shortbread, and fresh strawberries to mix in with.  Probably a perfect dish for my fellow lulu lemon heads.    I have also had their simple 3 eggs whites scrambled entree.  It comes with hash browns, toast, and choice of meat.  This is very simple and yet still delicious.  A perfect option for your plain Janes and Joe Schmos out there.    And finally, the pancakes and French Toast!  The OMG French Toast is quite sweet and huge!  It's got strawberries, mascarpone, and sweet sauces of caramel and vanilla creme drizzled.  This was shared as a dessert.  Now the pancakes....same problem with the Benedicts.  Can't decide?  There is a flight of 3 option.  You can pick and choose your top 3 victims.  They are smaller in size, but worth the taste of 3 pancakes.  The one I can't get enough of is the Pineapple Upside Down pancake!  MMmmmmm!!  If you do order that as a single choice option, you will get 2 of them the size enough to cover your face.    Down it down with some of that chai iced latte and you are set!"}
{"text":"Eggs  Benedict in so many different ways. Yummy! Great price point abs wonderful service."}
{"text":"My daughter took me here for Mothers Day.  I had shrimp and  grits.... delicious!! Different than I've had it before, but ever bit as good! We had to wait 1 hour and 15 min., but it was well worth it!! Our server was very good, she made sure our glasses were never empty!!"}
{"text":"This place was bomb.com!!! The food was amazing and the drinks were great. Went on a Wednesday morning with my family. Great vibes and the music was awesome!! Got the corn beef hash and their raspberry jam chocolate chip pancakes AMAZING!!!!!!! For drinks got the spicy bloody Mary and the mmm mmm Mamosa!! Definitely will be going back very soon!! The Bacon is so yummy and juicy!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Eggs Benedict are my favorite, you get two, and I really like that you can mix and match the flavors in one order. The loaded hash browns are good, and they have fun cocktails for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast in Tempe this place rocks the Benedicts are freaking awesome and the coffee and pancakes top it off"}
{"text":"I gave five stars even though there was a LOOOONG wait...however I can't hold that against them. The food and drinks held up to all the rave! The service was top notch as well! I will be returning!"}
{"text":"My name is Ha, and I'm basic bitch that brunches. Who doesn't love mimosas and breakfast? This place is happening, and there's a long wait. We were lucky and able to snag seats at the bar. They have a nice selection of eggs, bacon, pancakes, French toast, and a couple of breakfast sandwiches.  I decided on the pineapple upside down pancake with caramelized pineapples and creme anglaise. It's the best thing I've had in my mouth in a long time! It was so perfectly sweet, but not enough to make you sick. My only complaint is that my water smelled like fish. So weird."}
{"text":"Customer service was OK. I ordered a BLT with no condiments. And it came back with condiments sent it back did not want any more food. Every female look like they had woke up out of bed and came straight to work without showering their hair was ratty and disgusting. Our first server was a male that looked like a bum with a dirty hat on. We chose to get up and sit at the bar where they messed up my BLT."}
{"text":"I leave Snooze with few regrets and with much to celebrate. I've been here three times now, trying different dishes each time, including the spuds deluxe, shrimp and grits, chili verde benedict, corned beef hash, and many of the pancakes. Each meal has been utterly transcendental. But my favorite are the breakfast tacos, with corned beef."}
{"text":"Freaking 5s across the board!!!! Omg! Food Exceptional! Service Awesome! Our server was Spencer and she couldn't have been more attentive! She was such a doll! The mimosa was phenomenal! I had the Benny duo with salmon and beef chili verde!  I'm soooo full but a nice full! I'm so glad we came here! It was a great start for a Sunday!!! Ask for Spencer!"}
{"text":"This place has very good food! The problem is that occasionally it can get very busy and it can be hard to get service. Other than that snooze is a good breakfast place but it may not be very quick."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Music and atmosphere were great too. Service was slow and we had multiple servers taking our order. The thing that annoyed me was I asked for a mimosa and to be light on the oj bc I don't like a lot of pulp. When I got my check I saw I charged for a full glass of champagne with extra orange juice. If I knew I was going to be charged for a glass of champagne I would've got it with no oj at all. I would've disputed it but with our service being slow I didn't want to wait around."}
{"text":"Was so excited when this place came to tempe cus I had tried it in col. And it was amazing but at the orig location the servers could handle the huge crowds . not so much here. Ive been here twice and I expect a wait but both times clearly service is so slow that tables are not being turned quick enough and that causes the wait to be longer then it needs to be . I should not have to wait 10 minutes for a drink and 40 minutes for eggs. Im normally pretty generous when it comes to wait staff. But just have been let down to much here."}
{"text":"Very impressed. There's absolutely nothing that we didn't enjoy. Service. Food. Price. Can't complain at all."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday morning and had a 15min wait I would hate to see it in a Sunday funday but hey it's worth the wait! Great menu & hard to choose! I had the breakfast pot pie which was hands down one of the best breakfast inventions I've had! The \"pie crust\" was made of a flakey pastry so it wasn't too filling and the gravy they put on it was so flavorful! a perfect breakfast or brunch meal & if I lived here I would have this place as one of my top go-to places! My mom had the OMG French toast and it was freaking delish my grandma has the sweet potato pancakes and they were equally as good but the French toast was seriously amazing!  Great spot and highly recommend if you in Phoenix AZ :D"}
{"text":"if you want flys and Nats in your food, go eat at snooze. If you want to wait 15 minutes in between your server checking on you, go to snooze. And no it wasn't even busy!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the pancakes with Sunnyside up eggs and sitting on the patio with my doggie. I eat breakfast at Snooze about twice to 3 times a month. It's fantastic and the service is always quick and friendly. I've had all different pancakes, sweet potato, blueberry, Carmel with nuts. I sometimes get a Spanish egg thing or the eggs benedict which are both truly fantastic. Sometimes the waiters remember what I ordered last time which is so helpful. It's just a great place that I give a 20 on a scale from 1 to 10."}
{"text":"A friend suggested I try snooze because they have, and I quote the best brunch in town. The only mistake I made, was not taking their advice sooner. This is by far the best brunch I've had in the three years that I've lived in the valley. Most people would be highly upset and unlikely to revisit a business when the quoted wait time was half an hour, yet they end up waiting for a full hour. Thanks to the fantastic customer service from the manage, Matt, and his awesome staff, let's just say we were happy to wait for food this amazing. The service was top-notch and his professionalism is second to none.   In addition to the pancake flight with Cinnamon Roll (not on menu. Ask for it and thank me later), Blackberry sublime and Sweet Potato Pancakes, I got their Summer Harvest Benny: Parmesan pesto quinoa cakes with fresh Caprese salad topped with two poached eggs, cream cheese hollandaise, balsamic reductions, and Parmesan crisps. It was the things dreams are made of.   Also, the French Toast Neat is an absolute must have. Hard to go wrong with French toasted Bread & Cie brioche, topped w/ mascarpone whipped cream, fresh berries and Slopeside pure Vermont maple syrup"}
{"text":"I went there because my friend recommend me to this place since she knows I love benedicts!  Not your typical benedicts... there are different 'flavors.' I got a benedict that had mexican flavors to it. It was really good and the egg was cooked to perfection! The yolk was just cooked enough where the yolk was still gooey (just the way I like it!). However, it is not the best benedict I ever had.   I believe you can 'create your own pancake' too. I would definitely go here again when I'm in town, but I won't drive all the way over here just to eat (I live 40 minutes away). Next time, I will be trying the pancakes."}
{"text":"It was an amazing breakfast! Great staff! Celebrated my daughter's birthday and they sang happy birthday to her with a pineapple upside down pancake! Their mimosas are great too! You have to try the eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"Snooze is hit or miss. The tofu is terrible. I love that they have t but it's so undercooked even when I order it well done. Hashbrowns and pancakes are amazing. Mimosas are great. Great service this time."}
{"text":"Whoa... This place was a 180 from my last few visits. I had raved to friends as the best place in Phoenix for brunch, especially with all the very rare vegetarian options. I went for the sweet potato pancake, which is usually a semi sweet puffy heavenly plate of happiness. This time, they messed up and put the caramel on and had to take it back... About 10 minutes after everyone has cleaned their plates I got mine. I would've canceled it if we had been checked on more. The worst pancake arrived... A flat, sad regular pancake with chunks of sweet  potato. This was NOTHING like it has been in the past, I had two bites. The soyrizo was also horrible.. A mushy patty? The server knew that the food was bad as well as the service and apologized, but didn't offer to comp any of our uneaten food. Womp. The iced coffee is also not good, tastes like 5% coffee the rest water. It's weird because they even have a brochure about their special coffee. Anyways, I might be back because it used to be so good but definitely with low expectations. Snooze, what happened!?"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times, as usual the place was busy, which is a good sign in my books. The food is and was excellent, had a three egg omelette with beef, spinach and mushrooms, sourdough toast with blackberry jam and a hash brown. I tried one of their coffee cocktails, the dirty drunken chai. All fantastic. The only issue with the place was the service, poor would be an upgrade on what we got."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times , food and service is consistently good. We usually get a pancake of the day to share, those are always good. It gets super busy here just before 8 am so I would highly recommend to get here little bit earlier."}
{"text":"Alright I'll admit it, I'm no morning person. Sleeping in till 12pm is a breeze for me. And waking up before then is considered early for me. But no way will I snooze through the morning anymore after eating at this amazing restaurant!  After visiting Snooze for the first time in Phoenix and experienced the most amazing brunch ever, I just had to take my mom. We visited this location on a gloomy Sunday. It was raining earier but when we arrived the rain had stopped and the sun peaked through the clouds. The host took my name and number and told us the wait was about 45 minutes. We walked on over to the art festival Mill was holding untill I received a text that our table was ready.  After 45 minutes we were seated outside, which we didn't mind at all. I ordered a cappuccino with almond milk and my mom had a cup of coffee to start with. The cappuccino wasn't bad but wasn't amazing either. I actually really liked my mom's coffee more. After our drinks I ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie with the OMG! French Toast on the side. Mom got the Winter Harvest Bene with a side order of the Pineapple Upside down Pancakes.  By the time our server came out with our food the rain had started to pour. I was excited to dig it but the wind was super intense and started to damper the mood. I ask the waitress if we could sit inside as soon as there was a table available. She was very understanding and said yes of course. Less then 5 minutes later a outdoor umbrella comes crashing down towards our table. I let out a scream and held up my hand to keep it from falling on my face. A handful of servers witness this including our's. She quickly grabbed our plates and told us we're moving inside ASAP. We were seated promptly indoors and I was given ice and offered pain medicine for my hand. I'm thinking through all of this \"Man, when will I be able to dig into my French toast???? *cries*\".  Finally after getting situated we were able to fully enjoy our food. The puff pastry on my plate was amazingly pooffy and the sunny side up egg was on point. The gravy wasn't bad but I felt like it could use an extra something to make it special. The hash browns had the perfect crispy to soft texture ratio too. But honestly none of that really mattered after biting into the French toast. The warm mascarpone sandwiched between the perfectly toasted bread was outstanding. The caramel sauce on top was by far my favorite thing out of everything. You don't need syrup for this masterpiece of a dish! My mom loved her Bene  although wished the eggs were a bit more runny. I tried her pancakes and again you don't need syrup for them either. They were light and almost melted in your mouth. Probably the best pancakes I've ever had, yum!   My overall experience here wasn't so great because of the rain. But the manager and our server handled it well. The manager covered our check and followed up the next day to make sure I was okay. The food though, was totally on point for me! I for sure will be back, just not on a rainy day, haha ^^;;"}
{"text":"Fantastic pancakes and stellar french toast! Dropped by for brunch on a weekday and we were seated immediately. I got the OMG French Toast with a side of bacon and hash browns and my friend got the pancake sampler. The french toast is to die for! It comes filled with a cream cheese filling topped with the most amazing caramel sauce. I should've asked for an extra side of it! My bacon and hash were fabulous as well. I stole a bite of my friend's pancakes and each one was tastey! The pineapple one was for sure my favorite out of them!  Will for sure be back if I'm ever in this area. Normally I drop by the Tempe location but I found that service here was better and the food was slightly prepared better as well. Thanks for the awesome brunch!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for the entire family. Expect to wait but it's well worth it!  The Bloody Marys were the perfect blend of salty & spicy. Had the Quinoa Breakfast bowl which was very tasty; however, I didn't taste the prosciutto that was said to be on it. My other family members had the various eggs Benedicts and they said it was really delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've been here twice now and both experiences have been great. The wait is a little long on the weekends but it's well worth it, as the menu selections are out of this world. They use free-range eggs, there are lots of vegetarian options, and they have amazing breakfast cocktails. I highly recommend the breakfast scramble, which you kind of create yourself, as you get to select the fillings. The tortilla option is tasty (I think they're made in-house). On top of that, the pancakes are honestly the best I've ever had! I've only tried the cinnamon roll ones so far but they are so unbelievably delicious - I've never had any pancakes that come close to the ones at Snooze. Great customer service on top of it all - a fabulous place!"}
{"text":"Great place if you want to grab breakfast service was fast The coffee was very good in this place my breakfast showed up in a ok temperature"}
{"text":"I had the OMG French Toast and it was really good. The wait was about 30 minutes to get a table but I'm giving 3 stars because our food took a really really really long time. I kept thinking they were going to tell us that the meal was free, but they didn't."}
{"text":"Great mid morning get away- tell them it's your first time and get free pancakes of your choice"}
{"text":"Can't rate the food because it's a 75 Mins waiting for party of 8. No Reservations accepted. A little of frustration. Friend from Germany wants to try this out, but it wasn't justifiable for 1.5 hours of wait. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Pancakes are amazing. Would definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"so many options for eggs benedict! i checked the menu the night before and knew i had to try the elote version. we were told the wait was 45 - 60 minutes but ended up being seated much faster. the palomimosa (a mimosa paloma mash-up) was delicious - you can have tequila for brunch, right?? my order came out wrong but they fixed it quickly and were very apologetic. our server and the host were very friendly and the food was delicious. i LOVE this place! i'm a little sad that i found my favorite brunch spot while on vacation 12 hours from home!"}
{"text":"OMG! Where do I begin.....I have passed by this restaurant at least a gazillion times. Normally during the weekend this place has a line outside the door, so that in and of itself made me even more curious.   Finally, today I made my way for a visit. The place was upbeat, the wait staff was awesome and accommodating. The eatery was tidy and bright.   I ordered the AMAZING pineapple upside down pancake  with hash browns and bacon. I am so glad that I only ordered one pancake because I barely finished my meal. All of it was absolutely delicious. The orange juice even tasted freshly squeezed.   I cannot wait until my next visit to try some other options. I now also understand the name Snooze.....it is exactly what you will want to do after finishing up a meal there. The best breakfast/brunch spot I have encountered in a looooooong time!  I'm certainly a certified fan now!!!! Try it people you won't regret the decision."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their MMM MMM Mimosa with a pancake flight. Pineapple Upside Down, Sweet Potato, Banana Foster, Strawberry Shortcake; all amazing! Very much enjoyed our breakfast! Just wish the wait to get a table wasn't always do long! It was nice that they take your cell number and text when your tables ready."}
{"text":"Loved the decor, music, and food! The service was great. My family and I just flew in from a red eye... We were starving! So luckily they popped up on yelp for an early morning breakfast. I had the sweet potato pancake, which was perfect. It was too sweet."}
{"text":"When we come here, we already know the wait is going to be long, but it's always worth it. (No biggie- you can take a stroll over to Nordstrom Rack, Hi-Health, Choice Pet Market while you wait for Snooze to text you). Recently, I got the Breakfast Pot Pie with a side of hash browns & a side of bacon and was delicious! The Breakfast pot pie comes on a puff pastry square, topped with sausage gravy and an egg cooked to your choice! I would definitely get it again. My gf had the sweet potato pancakes and they were delicious as well, super savory flavor to say the least. The service is always excellent and we are always happy to come back :)"}
{"text":"Saw this place highly reviewed on Yelp. I'm staying in the Marriott Courtyard and turns out Snooze is within walking distance. Very friendly staff, seated immediately, coffee in seconds and order taken within two minutes. Very cute 60s decor. I ordered the corned beef hash with two eggs over medium. Eggs done to order, hash had great flavor and eng. muffin toasted to correct brown and warm. Waitress said that Snooze was founded in Denver so I'll have to check that one out with my wife when I'm back in Colorado. To sum up I'm a big fan of Snooze for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I have been here twice since it opened. Both times were on a Sunday, and the wait was excruciating long. I'm not going to fault the restaurant since I'm sure the longer lines are due to its newness and the weekend brunch crowd. However, I cannot excuse the lack of professionalism and disorganization throughout. It is obvious that the staff needs more training. They have brought us wrong orders, sat and moved us to different tables, and forgotten to check on us / bring us items that we requested, like straws. The food is inconsistent. The strawberry shortcake pancakes were delicious, but the egg benedicts were hit or miss. Four eggs, two of which were not poached correctly, and two were perfect. I think given more time, the front and kitchen staffs will work out their kinks. But I think I'll give it a couple of months before I give it another try."}
{"text":"This place was so disappointing.  The food was incredible but the service was horrific!!!   It was as if we didn't have a server. When we asked for things she seemed annoyed and even rolled her eyes once when she. asked. us. if we wanted something. We said no. So weird. After waiting forever for our watress to get something later I just decided to go get it myself. Eventually we had to ask someone else.  the girl literally stopped, sighed and was like \"uh okay\". I was stunned, it was awful!   I did end up speaking to the owner over the phone later, she seemed to care and said she wanted the feedback. she also said she'd like to send me a free meal, but it never came.   I would NOT recommend this place only because the business needs to figure out that just because the food is incredible  doesn't mean they get to treat people like crap. Very frustrating experience."}
{"text":"By far the best was the Benny Goodman.  Lox style salmon and cream cheese served over toasted rye and topped with poached cage free eggs, cream cheese hollandaise blended with sun dried tomato and caper relish.  Another great item was the sweet potato pancake with caramel and pecans on top...Mmm.."}
{"text":"Great food, great bold choices. Staff is usually always friendly and very helpful! They have a unique collection of breakfast cocktails to spike up the morning! Although the space seems small- \"the best packages are small packages\"! Well worth the wait and great spot for a date ! Pretty hipster for breakfast. Stop in and try some of their unique drills."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch in other words brunch!  Brought my family that was visiting us from back home for spring break.   I've been wanting to give this place a try, but haven't had a chance. I love how cute and modern it is I really enjoyed the decor to the silverware. Also I noticed the hip hop they played which I found kind of funny because it definitely did not fit their customer base here. However this music earned them an extra star lol. I love old school hip hop/r&b.   We were greeted by the hostess and got seated pretty quickly, that's another thing the employees here are like a bunch of little speedy gonzalezes no joke! We were a group of six. But with 3 6 foot men, yet they chose to sit us down in this little round table in the center of the restaurant. It was pretty tight!   I ordered the huevos rancheros with their pancake of the day it was some bacon with jalape√±o concoction. Which by the way was super delicious! They get all of their food from local farms which is a HUGE plus in my book! I only eat bacon of the source is a local farm.   Their menu wAs great pretty to the point! Everyone in my group was happy with their meal, but that pancake and that bacon was the biggest talk on our table! Our server was friendly funny and enthusiastic oh and quick!   Almost forgot to mention their jelly and coffee-yes yes yes!!!! All in all my only downfall was the small table lol but we made it work. I will most definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast food around. Longest wait around too. Sooooooooooo. Give and take. Great service when they get to you!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Snooze, and the best breakfast restaurant I have ever been to. I always come in and ask for the sweet little red head Jessica. Her wonderful attitude always makes my mornings better. They have some of the best bloody Mary's and mimosas in town. Not only the best rosemary sausage gravy I've ever had, right next to Grandma.. either way. This is probably the best running snooze to this date. Been to all of them in the valley and this is definitely by far my favorite."}
{"text":"I had the morning of my birthday off, so we ended up driving here to check it out. It was very busy for a Wednesday morning. We sat outside on the patio which was really nice. I had the pancakes of the day, which were buttermilk pancakes stuffed with strawberries. So good! Service was great, though slow, which I understand from how busy it was. I can't imagine how long the weekend waits can get here. Food was fresh, coffee was good, and I loved the mug size. Our little one had pancakes with a nice sized chocolate milk that was really good. She had some crayons and a coloring thing they gave her to keep her occupied which was nice.  For you moms, yes there is a changing table in the large bathroom stall."}
{"text":"We had great service and the food was tasty and very healthy.  Eggs Benedict served with a great salad and Home fries.  Ambiance was a hip, modern, comfortable restaurant.  Eggs Benedict a little runner and the ham good but a little thin. The waiter was friendly but the place was busy and I felt a little rushed to finish my meal."}
{"text":"I had the OMG french toast, it was beyond amazing. I would say it is the best to French toast I ever had. The service , here is excellent .thank you guys for making my morning"}
{"text":"Over all this place was pretty good. The wait sucked but food made up for it. I had the chilaquiles it had lots of flavor. It was a little pricey for the portions you get. I am not sure if I would ever come back here again though."}
{"text":"Went to Snooze yesterday because I was craving French toast. They are one of a few breakfast joints that offer gluten free AND vegetarian options.  I ordered the OMG French toast. It was OMG for two reasons: 1) it taste delicious and 2) the portion was tiny. If there was a kids size OMG French toast I think I had it. I was told that they have a new vendor for gluten free bread and their bread size is small. I understand that, but what I DO NOT understand is not including an additional piece of French toast to offset the size.   When our waiter asked if everything was ok I expressed my dismay over my kid size meal. He brought over more on the house. I appreciated that and tipped generously. I want other gf diners to be aware there is a big size difference between the brioche French toast and the gluten free French toast."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere! We went on a weekday so we didn't have a wait problem. I thought the food was okay but nothing to write home about. Our hostess was not the friendliest but I liked our waiter."}
{"text":"Good food . Cute atmosphere. I like.there are Vegan options. Good portions. Long wait. 1st visit today. Granted it was busy and a Sunday, but our service was okay at best....coffee and water sat empty. Food arrived missing some items vis a runner. Had to flag server down for extras like hit sauce, syrup, ketchup, refill on coffee, water etc. I would go back....but was ultimately a little unimpressed compared to other choices."}
{"text":"Good food nice location will definitely recommend this noteworthy place in Phx AZ. Great breakfast."}
{"text":"DEE ROCKS!!! I cannot enough good things about Snooze. From service, quality, Bloody Mary's, Benedict's to die for and DA pancakes!!! oh my gosh  to die for.    My husband and I came for a quick lunch break and met an amazing waitress. See greeted us and quickly offer something for us to drink. We already had drinks from the bar but quickly she brought us water and took our order. We decided to order the green chili Benny and I was not sure between the beef or pork. I asked her about the quality of their pork and if it was greasy. She offered me to taste it so I could decide which one was better to try. The pork was awesome, so my husband and I order that to split between the two of us and the sweet potato pancakes.   Dee was super sweet not only to let us try the food before we ordered but she actually split the dishes in advance. What a caring server for sure. She continued to fill our water and tend our table often with great professional demeanor and care. Not many people go above and beyond like she did. I hope someone at Snooze will read this and give her some kudos, a raise or praise for what she does.   Thanks, Dee. You are the best!"}
{"text":"Went to this establishment on a Sunday, was busy as I expected because I read reviews. We were a party of two and told the wait would be 30-40 mins but we waited only like 15 mins because someone didn't return for their seat on time , score!! So we started with the peach bellinis and we weren't too thrilled with those, due to the heavy presence of basil. I ordered the pineapple upside down pancakes, sausage, and eggs scrambled with cheese. My friend ordered the basic French toast, as well as a breakfast taco. The food was amazing the pancakes were delicious and the sausage patty was the best I've  ever had. My friend devoured everything while my meal could honestly feed two, so of course I couldn't eat it all! I can't wait to visit this place over and over again to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This was our 4th time going to this Snooze, so we had an expectation of good food and good service. Greeter was cheery and let us pick our own table, waitress [Anna.....something] was wonderful, got our orders taken and drinks quickly. Then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. Finally our food comes out, my wife had an incorrect pancake on her pancake flight and I had requested cheese on my hash browns. Anna wrote it down, it was on the ticket, but no cheese. We didn't even have a chance to take a bite when a large bald man stopped at our table to ask how everything was? JT, the manager, was stunned when we told him  what was incorrect. He immediately said he would get me a new order of hash browns with cheese. I said no, i'm fine, just take the cheese off the check! He agreed and apologized several times, making sure we were good.  Then my wife realizes that one of her pancakes is wrong [for whatever reason, they brought each pancake out on it's own plate] Right then Ramon, the other manager stopped by to apologize and check on us. We told him about the pancake issue and he was aghast! He took the wrong pancake, said he would be right back with the correct pancake and went straight into the kitchen.  We proceeded to eat our lunch, which was awesome, as usual.  When Ramon came out with the correct pancake, he and JT both said they were very sorry, very upset at the way this had turned out and they were going to take care of bill. They took a semi-bad experience and made it wonderful! We weren't terribly upset about the errors, mistakes happen and neither were egregious, but JT and Ramon took swift and decisive action, fixed what they could and then comped our food. THIS was the best restaurant experience EVER.  Thank you JT and Ramon!!  And Anna, our waitress! She was great too!"}
{"text":"Bright, well decorated restaurant and they have a very nice patio.  The service was attentive even though we lingered for a long time at the table, and she was really nice.  The menu is amazing and everyone else at the table loved what they got.  The sweet potato pancake with pecans on top was enormous!  I ordered their special french toast and, while I can see why others would rave about it, it just didn't have enough filling for me and the bread itself was dry inside instead of custardy.  Excellent coffee and they  have real maple syrup...I would go back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I ate at Snooze after arriving in PHX to see my parent's. We went here based on the reviews and proximity to the airport.   It was VERY BUSY on a Wednesday, it took 20 to get a seat. It's a cool looking place, kind of modern and retro.   My only complaint is there's no waiting area, so we just stood by the door. We looked at the menu in advance, and in Reno, I like Brad's Huevo's at Peg's, so I thought I would try it here.   We sat and our server was Fanny. Fanny was very nice and personable and we quickly ordered and got some great coffee.   Before the food came out there was a mysterious blueberry pancake and we were all confused because my parents are low carb, and being a Dragon, I would never get full off a pancake, so I didn't order, turns out Fanny was giving us a Special \"On The House Pancake\"!!! Very Cool!!! =)   It was the BEST PANCAKE I have ever eaten, and I am not a big fan of pancakes. It was made a hot grill so it was a great cook with texture on the outside, and inside was delicious and as you get to the center there's like lemon cream cheese. Anyways if you like pancakes you found Pancake Heaven Here!   My Huevo's arrived and I did Reno \"Brad\" style by getting a sausage patty underneath. All the meats here are thoughtful as they tell you the farm everything comes from and you could 100% taste the specialness. My sausage patty was the highlight!   Why only 4 Stars? Mainly because as I often do, my reviews are comparisons, and if Brad's Huevo's at Peg's is 5 Stars, it's hard to live up to that. My favorite part of this meal was the sauce it 100% grows on you and the sausage patty. If you are in PHX, I would definitely check this place out! AND...If you are smart, ask for Fanny, if you want great and personable service! =)"}
{"text":"Updating my previous review: after being gifted another visit I'm glad to report that our experience was much better. The staff was friendly and food was good. A much better experience all around, thank you.   Drove from the northwest valley to eat here since we enjoyed our experience in San Diego unfortunately the experience was not the same. There was no wait time to be seated but unfortunately waited for nearly 15 minutes for anyone to take a our drink and food order. Then never got refills on drinks until she brought the bill. The music was so loud you couldn't even hear the person next to you. Only giving 3 stars because the food was decent. Will not be recommending this place to anyone and will NOT be visiting again."}
{"text":"Recently tried this place out on a trip to Phoenix - it did not disappoint!  Service was fantastic.  Obviously this can always depend on the server you have but mine was fantastic - friendly, professional and certainly did a good job at selling me on the \"pancake of the day\" - a chocolate chip pancake with strawberry sauce.    Coffee was pretty good.  Refills were free and they came back often asking if I wanted some more.  The place was busy (on a Monday morning at 10:30am... I would hate to see what a weekend lineup was like?!).  There was a bit of a wait but since I was by myself I got right in at the patio bar table.   Would recommend for anyone looking for a good brunch option!"}
{"text":"Love this breakfast spot .. modern dining area, fast service and yummy food!!   On weekdays i stick with the Snooze Classic.. 3 eggs (cooked your way), ham (or bacon, sausage, chicken sausage or soyrizo for the vegetarian in your group), hash browns and toast with the most amazing jam!!   The pineapple upside down pancakes though are my favorite!! With caramalized pineapple and cinnamon sugar!!  The pancake flight allows you to select three pancake flavors .. in case you can't decide!! Today's pancake of the day was chocolate chip.   This location is always busy so get here early or allow for waiting time. The servers keep your coffee cup full and check on you often."}
{"text":"Food is very very good! I only wish they were open later. Super cute atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"So as a first timer im a little disappointed. I got the breakfast pot pie with the egg on top and a side of bacon. The bacon was so rock solid with no flavor. Plus i got just bits and pieces of the bacon not a full slice. 3$ for that?!  I guess i came in to late that they couldnt cook it fresh? Not sure. The hash browns were pretty good and the pot pie was good. I asked for hot sauce and the guy brings me a empty bottle? I let him know and he never came by to give me a new one. I also never got a refill on my drink after asking twice. I guess i just have terrible luck with that, seems every resturant they forget.  The service was alright. I dont think ill be back though. Really was looking forward to this place sucks how it turned out.. i wanted to order pancakes to go because they sounded so good, but i passed and kinda glad i did.. I dont think ill ever be back sadly... Also the music is really a bit much for kids. Maybe it was just the wrong time of day but not a place to bring kids. The music says bitch, motherfucker, hoe, pussy, dick, sex things of that nature. Not something a kid should be hearing. Not that i have an issue but if your looking to bring your kids, beware."}
{"text":"I went hear this morning and after reading the reviews I decided to go here. There breakfast was a little retro. The ham was good and the customer next to us had the pumpkin pancakes and we both want to go back to try the pancakes.  One thing that I can't get over is how everyone was how staff was dressed. In my opinion the staff needs a uniform. Yoga pants and, shorts are not appropriate we attire. I have a hard time when people look like they just rolled out of bed for work."}
{"text":"Wow! Phenomenal. Fantastic. All of those amazing words can't begin to describe this place. When I read my friend Andrew's review of this place and in his words, \"every town has a \"best brunch spot\" and this may very well be Phoenix(area)'s\", I was super excited to find out that this place was within walking distance from my hotel, Tempe Mission Palms.   When we walked in, we immediately felt old. Everyone inside was like 25 or younger. Oh well, I didn't feel out of place. The hostess and the waitress were super nice. Our waitress even brought us out a \"gift\", a pineapple upside down pancake. Thank you, Abbie. Now our trip complete. My friend doesn't usually eat breakfast, but she talked out this meal for hours.   They have several morning drinks available, including three versions of bloody marys. I played it safe and stuck with the basic one which was $.75 less anyways. For my meal, I ordered the Snooze breakfast burrito and requested the sauce and pico on the side. It was stuffed with scrambled eggs, hash browns, and black beans and was excellent. I'd say it was the best breakfast burrito I've ever had. I was hesitant in ordering it because of the potatoes, but they weren't greasy at all. My friend ordered The Snooze Classic which included farm fresh cage-free eggs cooked any style and a choice of ham, bacon, sausage, chorizo, pulled pork, chicken sausage or soyrizo, hash browns, choice of toast. She said that her entire experience was life-changing.   I agree this is \"the\" breakfast spot in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there with my parents, my husband and kids.  All the food was so good and I loved our server,  Bobby. I wish she could serve me at all restaurants I eat at.  She was so sweet,  fun,  and attentive.  I will be back. I had the pea polenta bene. It was really yummy.  my only complaint would be the kids meal quesadilla was mostly potato inside and then came with a side of potato.  I'll probably just get my kid a regular meal next time."}
{"text":"Snooze is a-maze-ing! I have not had a single thing that I didn't even not like a little bit. The pancakes are to die for. Get a flight so you can try 3 different kinds. The OMG French toast is seriously \"Oh My Goodness this is delish!\" Each and every one of the Benedict's are a knock out, its so hard to choose they let you get to different kinds on one plate!  The only thing I think could be a little bit improved on is the hash browns they don't wow but it doesn't stop me from enjoying the shit out of them with a perfectly cooked over medium egg on top.  I've yet to try the drinks but I'm sure they won't disappoint! Snooze is a definite must!!"}
{"text":"Went here recently with my wife and we absolutely loved it! The restaurant is very clean, decorated with what looks like their own logo, some type of star or snowflake on the glassware, the coat racks, it's even stitched into the leather for the seating in the booths.  We went at about 11:30am on a week day and were seated as soon as we walked in. The server was very friendly and attentive as was the manger.   We ordered sausage links, bacon, egg frittata, and pancakes that were so rich and delectable they should have came with a warning! (Bourbon Street Pumpkin)  When our food arrived, mentioned to my server I liked my sausage links cooked a little more but didn't want to send them back to the kitchen since I forgot to mention this when ordering. She wouldn't take no for an answer as she let me know she would have them make another order at no charge. Then the manager brought them out to me and informed me he had comped the second order and also gave me a discount on the bill. I was already going to leave a glowing review but that level of customer service is the icing on the cake!  There was ample parking for a week day but I've heard it's a madhouse in this area on the weekends with all these great eating establishments nearby.  This will be my \"go-to\" breakfast spot from now on! And looking forward to trying the Tempe location as well."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast with a group of 5. The wait was pretty long for breakfast, about 30-40 minutes. The decor was fun. Food was good. I had the breakfast taco which was tasty but I actually don't recommend because it was kind of messy to eat. The different egg benedicts looked good and so did the pancakes too. The sweet potato pancakes were surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Snooze delivers a superb breakfast experience. I went here originally in Boulder, and when I came to Phoenix I was really happy that they also had Snooze. It is a great place. The first time, I got a benny duo with the traditional (dat hollandaise was amazing) and the verde pulled pork (also gr8). The second time, I got the pancake flight. There was a sweet potato pancake which was not my thing but the blueberry danish pancake was amazing and delicious and next time, I am getting just that probably. The menu is diverse and great and expensive but I think brunch is worth spending big bucks on so I recommend it to all my fellow brunch lovers."}
{"text":"Came to Snooze Sun 1/22 AM... of course being a Sun morning there was a somewhat lengthy wait but took the time to enjoy a bloody mary on the front patio (good flavor but a bit weak for my taste).  They were very attentive to the patrons on the patio as one of the heat lamps ran out of fuel but they were able to quickly replace that. We were seated in \"Christie's\" section and she was as good as it can get service wise. Awesome personality, attentive w/o being obnoxious.  We ordered Snooze Spuds deluxe and Ham Benedict. While waiting another server brought us a pancake (forgot what it was exactly, had pecans & caramel sauce)... the person delivering this said that it was from Christie and she felt we needed something sweet to eat...WOW, have never had something like that happen at a restaurant. The food we ordered came shortly after and it was delicious with excellent portion size. I will make a return trip to this Snooze and will ask to be in Christie's section...not to get a comp but she was a model of how a server should be."}
{"text":"This is a cute, trendy breakfast spot.  The menu is very comprehensive.  Included are gluten free dishes, vegetarian and mucho healthy options.  Unique pancakes, eggs Benedict and drinks, yes drinks were most interesting.  I had corn beef hash.  It was perfect, crunchy and flavorful.  The pancakes were a bit heavy for my taste.  Be ready to wait but it is not Snooze's fault.  People love to linger here and linger and linger!  Food could have been warmer when served. I'll go back again, more to try."}
{"text":"This place rescued what was a horrible father's day and turned it into a awesome day.  The Eggs Benedict was awesome, the bloody mary was delicious (extra spicy).  The kids loved their dishes and my wife finally settled on the strawberry pancakes, which she loved.  We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"So disappointed in our experience at Snooze today! About halfway through eating my Bella Bella Benny, I found a hair. I alerted the server and she took it away immediately and said they would make me a new one. This was the chance for Snooze to shine, but nope. No manager ever came to our table to acknowledge the issue and guess what? They charged me for the dish!!   Sorry Snooze -- I was hoping for so much more from you!   Update: I heard from the business manager at Snooze right shortly after posting this. My faith in Snooze has been restored! I know mistakes happen but I am so pleased that this one has been handled as well as it has been. Thank you, Becky, for reaching out!  Snooze will have us as customers again soon."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous and worth the wait!! We dropped our daughter off at the airport on a Sunday morning and was looking for a place to have breakfast- The food is great and the service was incredible...Right down next to ASU campus. This is not your typical eggs and bacon food- They take the basics and step it up with the presentation! So if you aren't willing to wait you will be sorry...you won't find this food in any other breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Just had a mimosa with friends today but have eaten here in the past as well. The place is really nice and modern. This location is just off ASU campus as well as nearby to Mill Avenue; so there is plenty to see/do before or after grabbing a bite to eat (or a mimosa!)   The mimosa was pretty good. Standard I'd say and it came in a flute glass. The price, I thought, was a bit expensive but hey - I bought it anyway I guess.   All the food has been good here. My personal recommendation is the cinnamon roll pancakes!"}
{"text":"My dining companion and I have returned to Snooze several times and the food has been somewhat inconsistent (e.g., undercooked pancakes occasionally) but usually good.  This morning I was very disheartened to be given a small container of cream for my coffee which was nearly empty upon arrival at our table and contained another diner's disposed of empty sugar packets!!!!!!!  Gross!  Clearly, we were given someone else's trash!  Our waitress removed it without apology and brought a new (?) one.  Honestly, though, I didn't trust that she hadn't just removed the trash and added more cream to the contaminated cream.  I was too grossed out to use it.  Now I'm wondering if \"recycling\" left-over cream is a regular occurrence at Snooze and am not sure I will return.  Too bad.  It's a good thing that there are so many other great places for breakfast nearby in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - AWOLNATION - Sail)  Snooze  This is how I show my love I sang it in Bo Bites because Blame it on my bright Bowtie baby  This is how a pancakes made Yelp it on my own reviews Blame it on my bright Bowtie baby  Snooze, Snooze Snooze, Snooze, Snooze  Hit the Snooze one more time!  Oh wait, welcome to Snooze AM Eatery and highly popular breakfast/brunch joint that I first heard about out in the SD area.  When I attended I had to wait for 30 mins with my gang.  No worries I expected to wait since it only opens during the day.  When we finally sat we all decided to share the pancake trio - Pancake of the Day (Blueberry syrup with powdered sugar), Strawberry-Rhubarb, and the BanaNutella.  Of course we all each order an entree.  I went with Snooze Spud Deluxe - a plate of hash browns mixed with bacon and chorizo and topped with an overeasy egg!  Overall, this dish was a crunchy, mix of breakfast meat and egg with it's oozy yolk which helped mellow out the bite -- Yummy!   The pancakes were okay I thought.  I'm not much of a dessert pancake guy; the strawberry one was soggy since it was drenched in the strawberry-rhubarb sauce.  My favorite was the BanaNutella pancake - crunch of the hazelnuts and soft at the same time with a savory nutella!  We ordered the OMG French Toast just to top it off -- OMG was it good!    Overall, great service and the ambiance was vibrant and full of life.  A great way to start off the morning with good old fashion yet modern breakfast! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!! Pineapple upside down pancakes were to die for!! Chilaquiles Benedict had just the right amount of spice!! And the Mmmm Mmmm Mimosa and Spicy bloody Mary top it all off!! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Pancake flight. Enough said. Sooooo delicious. The sweet potato pancake is my all time favorite but every pancake I've had has been delicious. The tacos are great too. The only thing I don't recommend is the chicken sausage. It's bland and sausage shouldn't be bland. Other than that you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I have been going to Snooze since they opened and have never been disappointed. The menu is fabulous, the ambiance is great (fabulous music) and the staff is outstanding...starting with Kylie (sp) greeting you at the door; Echo the Manager, who is a real professional and all the wait staff, who is so well trained.  The food is amazing...not your run of the mill breakfast spot...but a kicked up menu with all your favorites.  A winner."}
{"text":"The wait was just as long as usual- 1.5 hours- but they make up for it with quick service once you're seated, an amazing staff and so so good food!! Love it, have been going to Snooze since the first location opened in Denver."}
{"text":"One of my favorite meals to eat out for is Breakfast, I LOVE Snooze. They never fail to deliver exceptional friendly service and delicious food. I highly recommend Snooze if you're ever near any of their locations- they are a must. Coffee is good and I love their hash browns. If you ever feel like trying something new, give their corned beef has a try! The best!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!!!! Hands down the best breakfast that I've had!!!! My friend and I ordered the trio pancakes and got blueberry Danish, upside down pineapple and sweet potato pancakes! Omg let me tell you... They were all delicious! It wasnt sweet at all and everything that was on it made it taste so perfect! We also ordered some eggs Benedict and I got the beef pot pie. Mmmmmm the eggs Benedict had shredded beef in it and it was so yummy with the pico de gallo! The beef pot pie was so good and I love how they made their biscuit super flaky and how it tasted light! I wasn't a big fan of the hash brown though. Other than that everything was delicious!! Service was great too and she was so helpful!"}
{"text":"My Gluten-Free boyfriend and I first tried Snooze while in San Diego and loved it. So we were incredibly excited to learn that one opened in the Valley.   We tried to go one weekend, but the wait was too long. So, we ended up going on a Thursday. We waited a bit, but I think that's really a testament to the food.  I ordered the corned beef hash. And guys, it's real corned beef! Not out of a can, like at most places. It had a crisp to it and it was so delicious.   My boyfriend loves it because just about everything on the menu can be made gluten-free.   The waitress treated us to a pineapple upside down pancake (gluten-free) and wow. It was amazing.  I can't wait to come back here. Yes, there is a wait and I'd stay away from this place on the weekends. But make time one week day morning. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm not even a breakfast person. But this is by far the best place I've ever been to and may have turned me into a breakfast person. The Benny duo was fantastic I tried two different flavors and both were great the hashbrowns were very well cooked and not overly greasy and the fruit was very fresh no bruises you could tell it was fresh-cut. I had a vanilla latte. Very well done everything had beautiful presentation and equally delicious sauces to go with it.  We waited about 30 minutes to get seated but absolutely worth the wait."}
{"text":"It was just ok... kind of bland and boring food.  The wait was too long. Not worth it to me."}
{"text":"Great brunch place, amazing pancakes and mimosa's just a little bit on the expensive side. Very loud with crowd chatter and awesome outdoor patio sitting. Just wish they had a little more shaded areas with umbrellas and they have a very limited menu items. Overall, great place to grab brunch!"}
{"text":"My daughter (who is 15 months old) LIVES for their pancakes and eggs! I've tried the breakfast tacos and the omg French toast and both were delicious! Love being in the town of Gilbert and experiencing great places like this! Paige is literally amazing! Both times I have gone in, I've had her as my server! She is so sweet and so kind! And she always gives great suggestions on food!"}
{"text":"Do not let the name fool you.  I am not a morning person and this place made me a happy woman from the time we sat down and throughout my day.  SEASONAL!! if they have the shrimp and grits, you MUST try it.  We're here on a mini vacation from northern California.  We've been here since Friday and have eaten out just about every meal.  We've had some great food.  But this place was the best all around we've had and we're hoping our plans can include a last breakfast before our flight in the morning.  I like to try new things but breakfast is always the classic potatoes eggs and whatever breakfast meat I'm in the mood for.  We were seated promptly (coming in after work and schools begin, my have helped with this) the decor takes you back back in time a bit but the casual and freedom dress of the staff keeps you in modern time.  Lyle (the most charming waiter ever) smiled from the time he greeted us and never stopped. He was amazing and very knowledgeable with all ingredients in the dishes we asked about.  When we asked about suggestions he recommended the shrimp and grits and the steak Benedict. They are seasonal and may not be available on our next visit down here.  Then he mentioned the pancake of the day.  Bourbon infused with  white chocolate chips pecans and.... Hmmmm he'd captured my taste buds at \"bourbon\" with maple syrup... My husband was torn on which Benedict he wanted and was thrilled about the option to choose 2 (TWO) different ones to make his meal.  I was torn between the bourbon pancake and the shrimp and grits.  I really didn't think I'd like this... (who eats shrimp for breakfast? And I never cared much for grits)... But Lyle described it so deliciously I opted for the shrimp and grits.  The  Coffee was good and HOT.  All of a sudden this golden disc of dreaminess was delivered to our table (compliments of our delightful server) THANK YOU LYLE!  You'd think this would be so rich you couldn't possibly eat more than a couple bites.  You'd guess wrong.  It was just the right amount of sweetness. Served on top of the drizzle of bourbon syrup, this treat kept its form, never got mushy and was just perfect.  Before we (yeah I shared it) were finished our food came out.  I'll let my husband rave about his Benedicts. My shrimp and grits was beautiful.  Now let's see how this tastes.  I don't get too emotional over food but this dish was Devine. The spice was perfect.  I could taste both the sweet peppers and the hot peppers.  I absolutely love that they dice all of it small.  The only big chunks was the very generous amount of shrimp that came with.  The grits ... Let's just say I will be adding them to my own breakfasts now.  The portion was just right for me as I'd even had some left over.  Oh I forgot to mention the eggs that topped it all.  It was delicious!  I'm glad I ordered out of my norm.  I wish it was morning already so I can go back and order something else.  I'm bummed Lyle won't be there but I have faith that we'll still be happy with our new favorite \"breakfast nook\"!"}
{"text":"Extremely pleased with the food and service. Well worth the wait. The shrimp & grits was on point."}
{"text":"Okay, I can't get over how my taste buds were totally HAPPY about the food I ate here. It is one of the most memorable and best breakfasts that I have ever had! I got the Smoked Salmon Benedict...cream cheese Hollandaise, GENUIS!!!!! The Sweet Potato Pancakes with Caramel sauce, I mean c'mon this should be against the law. It is so delicious!!! Now I'm depressed thinking about how far away from home this place is. =("}
{"text":"I've just discovered my new favorite breakfast locale!   I had the bangkok bloody mary and the snooze breakfast burrito.  The bloody mary: It was great! I love bloody mary's that are spiced with Siracha. They add crushed red pepper to the rim of the glass. That was a cool delicious add on.   The breakfast burrito: Wow! So good. I will say, that I customized it. I had them do egg whites, avocado inside, no cheese and sauce on the side. Tons of moderations and they got everything correct! The black beans in the burrito are purred which is delicious.   What a great little breakfast place. Good food, good drinks, good patio.....a win in my book."}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in town,  my most recent visit was on NY day and boy was it a packed house - 2 hour wait for a table for 2. I ordered the bacon/egg/hash brown plate and an order of flight pancakes to share.  My pancakes included pineapple upside down,  cinnamon roll and pain buttermilk.   I wasn't too crazy about the pineapple cake but the cinnamon roll one was absolutely awesome, it was pure perfection on a plate,  the buttermilk even though it's just a plain pancake it was equally good too.   This is a great little spot if you arrive early enough to beat the crowd or don't mind a wait if you arrive later. Whatever you do just get here."}
{"text":"Snooze is one of my favorite breakfast restaurants! I have yet to try something I don't like. My favorites are the chicken pot pie and the omg french toast! There is usually about a 30 minute wait because it is always busy. The staff is friendly and atmosphere is relaxed."}
{"text":"Snooze is definitly one of my favorite breakfast and brunch places. First time in the Tempe location and I love the vibe but hate the parking situation. Gonna have to cough up for the meters and it takes card. Besides that I will still continue to come here and enjoy the pancake flights"}
{"text":"I loved this breakfast spot! The food is so good and lots of yummy options. I loved how you could get any of their signature pancake on the kids meal! Great drink options and almond milk for coffee which my husband appreciated. The service was great, very friendly."}
{"text":"First time to Snooze. It was Sunday morning and busy quoted 15-20 minute wait and met that. Very innovative menu with lots of choices outside the norm. Gabby was our very friendly and attentive server. Not too friendly or spookily attentive, excellent blend! There were 4 of us and had a hard time choosing so we ordered one extra entree. The OMG french toast was just that. I highly recommend that entr√©e! We also had caramel apple pancakes, huevos rancheros, corned beef hash and the soft pretzel breakfast sandwich. Everything was excellent. Retro 70's decor and free fresh hot coffee while you wait give seated. Going back tomorrow for seconds!!"}
{"text":"The Pineapple Upside Down Pancake was to die for. A must get on the side to get that salt sweet. Had the Benny Goodman and it was awesome! The Lox was not over powering. Husband had the Chilaquilla eggs Benedict and he loved it. It's a must place especially if you're staying at the Marriott Courtyard."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a 3.5 star rating. A very cool eatery with retro interior, the offerings are well executed. I have never had a problem with the food or service but the menu is pretty generic for an upscale breakfast joint. The best meal I had was the quinoa porridge which was very unique and delicious.  I would like to see more seasonal specials or specialty coffee drinks."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time eating at a Snooze location and it did not disappoint. I love that everything is customizable from selecting two different combinations of eggs Benedict to enjoying a pancake flight with three different flavors.   My dining partners and I had the mmm mimosa, michelada, Chile verde Benedict, and pancake flight with the bourbon street pumpkin pancakes, upside down pineapple pancakes, and chocolate almond (flavor of the day). The upside down pineapple pancakes continue to be my favorite. I also loved the crunchiness of the chocolate almond.   Service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and the service is top notch!  The upside down pineapple pancakes are simply fantastic.  Great chorizo and green chile sauce for something with a little kick.  The place is always spotless and the waitstaff is very friendly and attentive.   Worth the price."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome food! Gluten free friendly:) The corned beef hash and eggs Benedict were scrumptious  The juices were fresh squeezed and coffee was excellent. Great service!"}
{"text":"My partner and I came here to celebrate my birthday and everything was beyond our highest expectations!! I had the Mmm mmm Mimosa with Promegranate liquor and we shared two dishes- the corned beef hash and eggs and the sweet potato pancakes with caramel syrup and caramelized pecans. Wow! First time I've ever actually tasted fresh (real!) corned beef for breakfast (instead of the Spam-like stuff most restaurants serve. The pancakes were the best we've ever had. Note the empty plate in the picture. Our waiter was Charles and he was the best - friendly, knowlegable and attentive. We will be coming here every time we come through Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Our office typically orders in on Fridays and we do either breakfast or brunch... Last Friday we tried out Snooze for the first time and had a wonderful experience!   From the moment the phone was answered the customer service was done extremely well. She (I wish I remembered her name) was extremely attentive, helpful and asked appropriate questions. Our order was large, about 10 breakfasts and she was kind of enough to take down our names and be attentive to certain food allergies I listed off.   Upon picking up the order, again, greeted by excellent customer service and impeccable friendliness. She confirmed the orders and made sure to point out the allergies.   Food was delicious as it could be after the 10 minute drive back to the office, we WILL be ordering from here again. Prices are very comparable and overall very pleasing.   ***update.. We have used them again and again for breakfast and have been provided with the most excellent service time and time again!!"}
{"text":"This place managed to fuck up bacon. Another trendy, hip Gilbert eatery that lures you in with aesthetics but does not deliver on food.  Got there really early on a weekday to avoid crowds. There were 4 people chatting at the hostess booth, including one cocky little prick that needed a throat punch. Despite this ample staffing, we were ignored until we finally broke up their conversation to ask if we were supposed to seat ourselves. Sure, they said. So we did. Then waited 10 more minutes for a menu, when I finally went to get them myself.  This place is always packed and I cannot figure out why. They do have intriguing pancake flavors but they do not taste as good as they sound, and the rest of the menu is uneventful and overpriced. Bland hash browns in a ring mold= I instantly hate you. Blah eggs. Blah toast. Extra charge for thick, tough, bizarrely herbal infused bacon. I have never, never not eaten my bacon.  The disappointment continued to fester as we had an eternity to stare at our uneaten food and wait for the check. $40 for me and my kid.   Ya know, if I were a server and noticed that my patrons didn't eat their food, I might ask why, but this chick was far too oblivious.   And as I walked out, I noticed the font they used on their hours of operation- papyrus! Unacceptable!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the OMG French toast and my mouth was doing the happy dance best French toast so far.  Definitely coming back here"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I had the eggs Benedict and they were amazing! I was seated right away and the service was prompt and the prices are great! Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"The food is great (can we say pancake flight!?) and the style is super cute. I'm taking away a star because it's just so damn busy ALL THE TIME. We've been several times and 45-60 minute wait each time. I know, that should be expected on weekend mornings but c'mon.... it's definitely a deterrent."}
{"text":"Awesome food... had the Juan tacos, recommend by Jeff, my waiter.   Super great service at entrance as well.  Everyone is super friendly.  Bring your doggies too... they will get lots of love!!  You won't be disappointed!!  This places rocks all around!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the one in San Diego and this location was just as great. Service was great as they are well staffed. There's always a line but it goes by fairly quickly especially if you have a group of 4 or less. I like how the menu is slightly different at each location so it's definitely worth checking out different locations. I generally stuck with the egg benedicts. They're super delicious. Although, I wish their portions were a little bit bigger or decrease the prices since each plate rarely ever fills me up compared to other brunch places I've been. Nonetheless, I definitely recommend Snooze if you haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"It's annoying they don't do reservations or call ahead seating but oh well you can shop nearby shops while you wait. I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups as the tables are small. However! The food is fresh and excellent. Pancakes are to die for! I recommend all of their pancakes (I tried several) and the B.E.A.T sandwhich."}
{"text":"Same great food as their other location.  Wasn't happy that there was no wait however it was a Friday with ASU on summer break.  I would imagine I wont be going back to this location when school is in seesion.  Also parking is more difficult here. The location at the Town and Country has plenty of free parking."}
{"text":"Would give it 5 stars for the food, service and ambience but have to knock it down a star because of the long wait times to get in.  C'mon please take reservations and make everyones life easier.  The hash with green chilies in it is to die for.  They also make a killer bloddy mary. I understand they are getting ready to open a place in Tempe. I can only imagine what the wait time will be like there.  They also carry a few beers but the choices don't make sense. I'm sorry but who wants to drink a big IPA for breakfast, they'd be better off selling San Tan's Mr. Pineapple, Papago's Orange Blossom or Sonoran's Vanilla."}
{"text":"Love Snooze. They have the best breakfast ever. The \"I Like Elote\" is to die for. The hash browns are so good too."}
{"text":"Never a dull moment at SNOOZE!   It's definitely packed and has reason to be! You will wait a bit for a seat if you're not early on the weekends, but let me tell you, it is absolutely worth every second of the wait! Their pancakes are to die for, the eggs Benedict are amazing, and the breakfast booze is always appreciated! On a cool day, it is nice to enjoy your meal on the patio.   I recently had their \"Breakfast Pot Pie\" and it is so good! Of course I had my meal accompanied with a Bloody Mary.   Go go go! It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Feels like a ski lodge, they bump an interesting blend of electro/dance music like the lodges too. It makes sense since Snooze is a mostly Colorado based breakfast/brunch chain and the interior matches it's laid back attitude with simple orange decked decor.   Free coffee in the lobby is pretty good but the paid stuff is even better. I can't quite explain the coffee taste but it's a strong bold blend with a fruity and floral aftertaste.  The mocha is delicious! I sipped through it pretty fast but at least there's a lot of whipped cream to eat when your done.   Food-wise they do a great job as well with pretty huge portions. The spuds deluxe was a giant serving of potatoes with scallions and cheese. I chose the barbacoa and mushrooms which were great but wish the dish came with eggs instead of having to add them on for $2 extra dollars. The B.E.A.T. was a solid rendition of a BLT as well with egg and avocado ($1.75 extra) and a nice little cake of hash browns on the side.  Great addition to the neighborhood with Postino's and I look forward to eating here more. The price at both joints though will be limiting my trips sadly :'(  Drinks looked interesting, especially the Bloody Mary variations! Though I'm a little hesitant to get my drank on in the morning."}
{"text":"The wait was a little long, especially on a holiday weekend where we had reservations, but it was pretty good.    - Friendly service - The location is fun and I like the open and well-lit space - The hashed browns are solid (I needed a little extra salt on mine) - The corned beef hash didn't have a lot of pop to it.  The corned beef might have been a little too lean - My daughter thought her grilled cheese was excellent - Reasonably priced, but the portions (for a breakfast place) were a little on the small side"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. This is my favorite breakfast place. The pineapple upside down pancakes are absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The breakfast is always phenomenal when I come! I've had many meetings here and brought visiting friends and family here as well. Each time they never disappoint!  The only downfall to me is the parking. But much like the rest of DT Tempe, paid parking is the norm. At least they are conveniently located right next to a parking garage so you don't have to go too far!"}
{"text":"Customer service was outstanding! Food was excellent and loved the friendliness of Snooze.  Was our first time here, would definitely recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"Decided to give snooze a try today. Overall the experience was good, but had to give them 4 stars because the Hashbrowns were bland and our server Abbie was kind of slacking. Did not offer us any condiments; order a chia tea latte never got it, even after reminding her a second time. Maybe she was having a rough day. But let me tell you, Travis is the man! He was great and very helpful to make sure my two little kids had shade from the sun. On another note the pancakes were delicious!!"}
{"text":"OMGosh......the BEST breakfast ever...service was point on, food was fantastic, for sure will drive again here from the far West side (83rd/glendale)... Need one of these on the westside!!! If I could give more stars I would"}
{"text":"So amazing. The breakfast tacos are the best! You must come...request Jason when you do, he makes the experience all worth it."}
{"text":"It's ok...probably overrated but still ok. The alcoholic breakfast drinks we had were awesome though. I'm boring and got a mimosa, but it was just the way I like it... 6oz champs and 2oz OJ.  The french toast with mascarpone was so underwhelming. The flavor wasn't bad, but it didn't knock my socks off. My husband had the breakfast burrito and it was HUGE like a brick. Unfortunately, it was 80% black beans."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed! The French Toast was Cold & Soggy. Visited on a Wednesday Morning so there should have been no excuse for this type of a result. New Place in Gilbert however way too much hype. For breakfast in the East Valley I'm sticking with TC Eggingtons or Crackers Cafe. More bang for the buck and much better food."}
{"text":"Delicious pancakes! The wait is a lil long to sit & get your food but the food is worth it"}
{"text":"I will admit when my boyfriend and I arrived at 11 for a late breakfast and we were told it would be an hour wait we almost left. However we stayed. The wait want quite an hour, but even if it had been it was so worth it!!! Great food, excellent service! Both our drinks stayed full, keep in mind they were PACKED! Yet not once did our drinks empty out! Also we noticed that they used the same glass for our drinks, most might complain about that, but we think it's a great idea!  Great place to go, don't let the wait fool you. There's a reason there is such a wait! Thanks so much, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"originally thought it was another hipster place, which isn't really my thing. but the crowd, and i don't kid when i say crowd, was a mix of all types. the food looks great. you know how sometimes you see someone else get their order and you think it looks good and you want it too? well almost everything catches your eye in that way. even the drinks. but the taste? fantastic! you taste how fresh the ingredients are and the food really is good. i'd give it 5 stars, but i feel that knowing the wait can be so long, they could offer a deal on drinks while waiting or something like that while we are waiting for those who are done and just sitting in much needed seats 20 minutes past finishing their meal that there are people waiting (when wait times are at 40 min)."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast.  Great cocktails.  Ordered the drunk enough monkey French toast delicious. New favorite place in Tempe."}
{"text":"Just better than IHOP or Waffle house. They offer some strange eclectic items. But the excel in offering veggie and vegan friendly options.   Perhaps I made a bad choice and ordered the blueberry pancakes and I hate to say while everyone is going to love them, it violated my taste buds. It's a Danish so the gooey interior is delicious but it makes the panacakes questionable as to was it soggy before or after being applied. Who likes soggy pancakes? Not Aunt Jemima! That's for sure.   They really shined with their breakfast burrito. One taste and I was like this is what I should have ordered. It's covered in green sauce and we got alternative meat that would make most vegans cry. Very scrumptious, tough and light chew for the meat and fresh and salty tomatoes. It just needed more cilantro.   The coffee was alright and I can't wait to try their breakfast drinks but with work around the bend I opted out. I would be willing to retry this place and shy away from deserts disguised as breakfasts."}
{"text":"Just love it here! Because of the long wait times, we order ahead and pick up for breakfast at work.  The breakfast burrito is on point, but a word of caution, ask for it to be easy on the black beans...& we love to add bacon!"}
{"text":"Pineapple upside down pancake was amazing!  The wait was a little long, but the food was so worth it!  Went there for a meet and greet between my boyfriend/mom.  We each had something different, but loved every bite!  My mom happened to mention how great the pancake would be, and the waitress brought us one on her!  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys good breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while walking around ASU. Fun atmosphere and food was real good. Had a nice waitress, good place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious eggs Benedict's- I had the Chili Verde version. Lovely, lovely service. Very friendly and laid back but very efficient"}
{"text":"The Good:   The restaurant itself has a fantastic midcentury vibe with lots of open windows and nifty seating. The menu was packed with so many delicious-sounding choices that I had a difficult time choosing just one. Fortunately they would let you sub a pancake for your breakfast side so I got to choose two! The food itself was magical; everything tasted exactly right and the portions were perfect for a filling meal.  The Bad:  First off, we were told there'd be a ~20 minute wait to get in. I understand and have no big problems waiting at a busy restaurant, I even thought it was pretty whiz-bang that they'd take my number and text me when a table was ready. Half an hour later my phone was still silent so I checked in and it turns out that the girl had noted my phone number incorrectly. To her credit she seated us immediately after discovering the mistake.  Once seated one thing became immediately clear: this is a *noisy* restaurant. There were parties of boisterous, energetic folks whose voices followed suit, and I'm okay dealing with that. The problem is that the restaurant pumped in loud pop music on top of that, so there wasn't just the din of a busy restaurant but a cacophony of conflicting noises. If you are hung over or otherwise want a quiet meal this is not the right place for you.  The Manic Pixie Dream Girl (google it) who served us was nice enough, but seemed eager to leave the table every time she engaged us and ended up missing small details like the coffee my dining partner ordered and later cream for that coffee. Fortunately my dining partner had pre-loaded on complimentary coffee during our too-long wait for the table otherwise violence may have ensued.   The Weird:  While waiting for our table some old guy came walking up with his pot-bellied pig on a leash, the pig wearing a Snooze AM teeshirt. I don't always expect to see my breakfast before eating it.   TL;DR:  I have a full tummy, but dealt with too much noise and neglect to be satisfied with the meal or the experience."}
{"text":"Great service, pleasant inside and outside seating arrangements and comfortable relaxed atmosphere. The food was pretty good, although the eggs seemed to be quite small, so three egg breakfast is not at all intimidating. Overall I did not feel that we got  a good value for the price.  The two things that were very bad - coffee and a choice of music. Coffee was watery and disgusting. Neither cream nor sugar could rescue it. Terrible music of a style I'm unfamiliar with was blasting precluding is from talking in comfortable tones of voice and forcing waiters to squat next to tables.  Maybe the issue is that we came near closing time, will try to get there earlier next time - maybe it will be better."}
{"text":"First off I will start by saying I will never eat breakfast anywhere but here ever again!! I ordered the blueberry Danish pancakes and can honestly say they were the best pancake i have ever had!! The lemon in the middle made the pancake over the top!! It was a party in my mouth!! The only reason for the four star is the wait.  We were told 15-20 and we waited for 35 ... The staff was very nice about the extra wait and apologized profusely!! Will be eating here as often as possible :)"}
{"text":"Been here for several times and always love their French toasts. Try banana one, I think it is better than strawberry French toast."}
{"text":"Phenomenal breakfast meats, too much time spent waiting.  We checked in at 1:03(on a Sunday), and got a table (inside) at 1:32 (told it would be a 15-25 minute wait). We ordered drinks and food at the same time.  It was just about 2:00 before we got the food. I ordered the classic 3 egg, hash + bacon with sourdough toast.  I thought my meal was delicious, though the hash was heavy on the pepper. Two gentlemen with with me ordered the Spud deluxe and both felt that it was a 6/10. They did however love the sausage they got with it. Music was pretty loud.   I am giving this hipster place 4 stars because of the lengthy wait."}
{"text":"I tried the Snooze location in Tempe and had an equally great experience. I've realized that you can't go wrong with any of their benedicts, and as per usual, the sweet potato pancakes were delicious."}
{"text":"Great place! Always busy and the food and service are always excellent!   I typically just order the three egg breakfast with bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Look, I get it, sometimes places are just so busy it's hard to be on top of your game. We were told our wait for a table would be five minutes but after waiting patiently for forty-five minutes I finally went to the hostess and she said we had been sat already. Well, I'm here to say we haven't so either someone took our table when our name was called or what I think is our name was never called and we got skipped. We waited right by the door and never heard our name. The hostess didn't take our phone number because it was supposed to be a very short wait to begin with. The hostess did immediately get a table for us because of the mishap. Our experience would have been redeemed had the food been better. My husband did really enjoy his Sandwich I Am. I got the French Toast Neat, it came with a marzipan cream rather than butter and the bread used was a bit too dense. The hash browns are highly onion flavored. But worst of all--there was a long curly hair on the French toast, what? Ew. I am disappointed because Snooze came so highly recommended by local friends. Honestly, the best part of our experience was how wonderful our waiter was. Sadly, I am not sure I will give this place a \"next time.\""}
{"text":"The first time I came I got the tacos and wasn't completely thrilled... I then got the classic because how could you mess that up and I was much happier. We ordered a pancake to split and was pretty disappointed (it was really hard and almost seemed burnt?)."}
{"text":"We are so happy we decided to eat here! When we first pulled up we saw a line at the door but we had time to kill so we decided to go for it, after a short 5 minute wait we were seated outside. My husband and I each got a mimosa which was delicious yet somewhat spendy $7 for a mimosa just seems overpriced in my opinion, but still tasted good. We each got a different eggs benedict and they were both delicious! Wish we were staying in the area longer so we could come back."}
{"text":"I would give this an extra star for the food but did not because of the waiting experience. This place is not bad at all. I am suggesting they have some benches outside for the crowd that waits outside. Also, location isn't bad but the size of the AM eatery is a bit too small for the amount of customers they receive."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing! When we walked in, nobody was there to greet us, then we were told to wait for a table that had been open the 5 minutes they had us waiting. The wait staff seemed like ASU students who went out to a party the night before and came in to work sluggish and out of it. The organization of the restaurant could be much better, but the staff was very nice and the food was great! Best pancakes I've ever had, fantastic eggs Benedict and green Chile hash. Despite the staff, my family and I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Horrible under pressure with wait time, they have notifications by texts so we stood in front of the desk.  We were standing right next to the front counter waiting for our name to be called and they never did, when we came up the lady did not even recognize us (we were standing right in front of her) and stated that they called our name.  Bullshit, as we were standing right in front of her stupid face for 45 minutes. Really bad customer experience, we had to leave. Not going back to that place EVER!"}
{"text":"WOW!  We got there, and there was a line.  They asked for my cell phone number.  I gave it to them and instantly got an email telling me that I would get another text when my table is ready.  A quick 15 minutes later, the four of us sat.  So many good choices!  I had the pancake flight with my choice of any three of their pancake flavors!  All three were great!  I had chocolate batter with strawberries, blueberry pancakes, and pineapple upside down!   the coffee was also good.  the others with me enjoyed theirs also.  One commented how much they like the weight of the silverware!  don't you hate when the fork weighs less then plastic ware--not here!  My wife said the bathroom was clean but a bit small.  Anyway, this is the first location in AZ.  I will be back, and I. Highly recommend it if you are nearby.  We drove from ahwatukee and it was worth the drive!  The general manager came from Paradise bakery, and knows how to please guests!  I would have bought a hat or tshirt as a souvenir, but did not see them displayed anywhere!  Oh well, maybe next time!  Snooze AM Eatery!  Only open until 2:30, so enjoy a hearty breakfast!"}
{"text":"It was 45 minute wait, which is expected Saturday at 11:00. We sat down ready to order, it took ten minutes to be greeted and drinks ordered, (they forgot about us). Ordered pancakes and eggs benny, a mimosa and bailey and coffee in one go. Drinks took at least ten minutes, but were great. Now we play the waiting game...45 minutes later we get some food. Which I might add was awesome.  As a restaurant worker, I understand you can't do anything about slow food or bartenders slowly making drinks. But the people next to us got a pancake while they were waiting, the entire table next to us got free shirts, and the other table got a free round of drinks. We got a long wait, good food, and server needing a tad more empathy.   We'll come back. Hopefully they'll get food and drinks times down. A bummer birthday breakfast for two."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place the first time I went. The second time it wasn't as great. The OMG French toast I would definitely recommend though"}
{"text":"Short and sweet. I never understood breakfast until I ate here. Corned beef hash, eggs over medium with the most amazing sweet potato pancake (tender, buttermilky, cakey) and caramel syrup (sauce?) I have EVER eaten. Usually I'm more likely to tune in to the corned beef hash (this was crispy, just the way I like it but I would personally like my peppers a little hotter) but that pancake? Oh my! I will be back... and not share. Get your own, honey. Oh yeah! He got the Eggs Benedict, didn't share so I assume that was pretty darned good too.  Go. Wait, don't go. The line is already crazy. But you will be rewarded."}
{"text":"Brunch at Snooze never disappoints. I've eaten at this location countless times over the past couple years. It's by far my favorite location. (I had to take off a star for the crazy wait times, though that is expected at all the locations.) The wait is always long, typically at least an hour or longer. If you plan ahead and go after 10am though, you can wander next door to Nordstrom Rack while you wait. No downside there. Or, go early and beat the rush. It is always worth the wait though.  The Spuds Deluxe is a killer stack of hashbrowns that you can load up with all your favorite things, bacon, green chile, cheese, whatever makes you happy. I could eat their gravy with a spoon, so the Pot Pie is a favorite as well. The different Benedict options are pretty amazing as well. My current favorite is whichever one comes with the killer balsamic reduction.   For sweet options, a pancake flight is a great way to try several things at once. Although, be warned most of them are solid desserts and the pancake of the day is typically the sweetest. The basic French toast (isn't really all that basic) it's my favorite thing in the sweet category.   Basically, you can't go wrong with Snooze, just plan a full morning for your brunch and don't expect to be hungry for lunch later."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place but it was only ok. We waited about 30 minutes for a table. Service was solid but nothing special. First strike was the hot chocolate. Just tasted like warmed up milk, no chocolaty flavor. I ordered the breakfast tacos with sausage. They weren't seasoned at all. My husband had the peanut butter cup pancakes. Sounds delicious right?  They were fine but not great. Overall, my feeling walking out was \"meh...\""}
{"text":"There is always a wait and I don't think it's worth it. The bar tender making coffee is a grouch and absolutely do NOT order Huevos Rancheros - it is made with spaghetti sauce. Stick with a Benedict - they are yummy. The coffee is good."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch places I have been to (and I am from Portland OR so I know about brunch). Of course with this, it gets packed. We waited 45 min for a table but forgot all about that when the food arrived. I also noticed they have a ping pong table set up while you wait. Nice touch."}
{"text":"Updating my review on Snooze. Previously we have a pretty poor experience. After writing my review the manager asked me if I would try it one more time and we did. Both of my boys are under the age of two so when we bring them its a true test of the restaurant as well as a test of my patience :) Snooze did great! They even catered to our need for special seating. When you have a kid in a high chair and another in a car seat things get tricky when it comes to that. Ramon made sure our experience was excellent and it was thanks to him. I ask the Ham benedict (which is what I got last time) and it was GREAT! the hollandaise was on point and super filling. My husband got the Chillaques Benedict and he LOVED it. like really loved it. I was only allowed one bite. And that one bit was really good. My 2 year son got the pancakes and he loved those as well. The kids meals are actually pretty big. It came with a pancake, hash browns and fruit. which was really great. I had the local iced brew coffee and that was really tasty. not too bitter which some cold brews can be that way. My husband had a mocha which is his staple coffee and liked it as well. We also sampled the gingerbread hot cocoa which was their special for the month and that was seriously good! It tasted like cinnamon toast crunch and the gingerbread man had a baby!! YUM YUM YUM. So im thinking our visit previous to this one today just must have been an off day. Which happens to everyone. Its a busy restaurant and you cant expect perfection which such high volume. I can now say this company takes pride in their staff, customers and food. We will definitely come back, but maybe not at breakfast rush hour on a weekend :) Cheers to you Snooze! And thank you for making our breakfast great today!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Really surprised by the nearly 5-star review.  Ignoring the spotty service that we received, I give this place a 2.5-star rating, not needing extraordinary measures to come back but really, really hesitant to.  And that's just based on the food.  Ordered the Benny Duo with a ham and chile verde benedict.  Also ordered a side of bacon, chicken sausage, a side of eggs, and a chocolate chip pancake.  The Benny Duo comes with a side of hash browns.  They have apparently changed the way they serve has browns here.  They used to be scattered on the grill, now they come from a cylindrical mold.  Makes for more space on the flattop to cook other stuff, but also leads to no crispiness at all in the hash browns.  The top of my hash browns were just barely browned and what was in the middle was cooked through but on the mushy side.  The side of bacon was marginally saved by the fact that they use well-sourced, thick-cut bacon - but not crisped at all.  Limp and greasy all the way through except the last bite of the last piece.   The ham benedict was superior to the chile verde.  The chile verde comes with pulled pork on a tiny stack of green chile tortillas.  Very little green chile flavor coming through.  The pulled pork was moist but lacked flavor.  To their credit, both eggs were well poached.  The ham benedict would have been pretty perfect but for the hollandaise, which was way too thick and lacked tanginess/citrus.  I'm sure that sauce will never break but it's not a good hollandaise.  My wife was also disappointed with her chicken sausage (which is a patty, not in a casing) and her chocolate chip pancake, and I concur.  Pancake was not fluffy, lacked butter, with the chocolate chips being the only thing going for it.  And they would have been better off serving a pounded out piece of chicken breast instead of the chicken sausage patty that they served - which had marginally more flavor and was dry.  A paillard wouldn't have required them to grind down chicken meat in the first place and it would probably taste better.    The atmosphere is quite nice, it's trendy, and staff was friendly - but that didn't make up for the mediocre food that got.  Again, 2.5 stars, would have been showing 3 if service were more even."}
{"text":"Very good place for a filling breakfast or brunch. Right next door to Postino and I never knew about it. I got the breakfast pot pie -Flaky crust pastry and pot pie filling with an egg on top. We also tried the ham benedict and chile verde benedict combo. Overall a great time! The menu uses seasonally sourced ingredients so we'll be back throughout the year."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Get there early as wait times increase quickly. Service was attentive. Food was great for others in my group. I ordered two eggs over medium and got two eggs over super easy. Yikes! Though my eggs were runny, I still ate them as I rarely will send food back. Alcoholic drinks are available for breakfast, which is cool. Planning to return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Great food with a wide selection of breakfast items. This place is ALWAYS busy! So go early or have a tiny snack before you go.  They definitely have a little spunk to their style. You'll enjoy the food and tge atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent food and tough choices... I always seem to have a hard time deciding between the sandwiches, the burrito and the pancakes/french toast options!   Had the burrito for the first time today and it was huge... great flavors with the green sauce on top!  This location seems bigger than the one in Gilbert.    Come early, there is always a wait, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I been to the one in San Diego, but the quality is a huge difference.   Ambience: non existence....it is equivalent to Denny's.  Service: waitress is extremely nice, but waiting for the food was ridiculous.  Took almost an hour for food to come out but they forgot some of the ingredients on our order which took another 30 minutes to make  Food: how should I say this in a nice way...I can t... Because the wait was so long that everything seems bad."}
{"text":"I like how we can get in and out quickly. They're quick to seat and serve you. I'm disappointment with the size of their eggs Benedict though-it's so small. But it's so good, I get it every time. My friends like their breakfast burrito. It's a good size for it's price."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast potpie and chili Verde benny. Very solid. The puff was wonderfully flaky and the sunny side up egg was cooked well. The Benny was decent. I prefer a real English muffin over layers of tortilla. Otherwise, taste was still pretty good.  Today there was no wait because its Superbowl Sunday and very foggy out, but I overheard some convo nearby that typical wait is up to hours on weekends."}
{"text":"Lots of creative breakfast and brunch options that taste as good as they sound! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks, amazing atmosphere, loved it. I will definitely be returning for more Eggs Benedict and Micheladas!"}
{"text":"One of the places where the food keeps you coming but the service sucks. I get that they are busy but you shouldn't be rushing your customers out the door at the end of their meal, especially after waiting 45 minutes to an hour. We have started ordering take out and it is far more enjoyable and no waiting for a table!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. The wait sucked, but obviously that means its fantastic and they have a great system where you check in and you can go shop and they'll text you when your tables about ready so you can do whatever you want or shop while you wait, which theres plenty of in the area. Best eggs benedict in Phoenix. It doesn't matter which one you get they're all amazing. Go here go here go here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try this place. Came here for my birthday and I have to say it wasn't worth the wait. The portions are small for the price.   Let's start with the location itself. Extremely noisy, to the point where you can't hear the person in front of you.  The customer service was very good, as the staff was pretty friendly and courteous.   On to what I oredered. The OMG! French Toast was a big let down. They were supposed to be stuffed and I didn't really see it, unless that was the stuff melted into the syrup. Taste could of been better, nothing OMG about it. But, you could taste the coconut. I was told by the waitress that it was 2 stuffed french toast cut into quarters, but in reality was just 1 french toast cut into quarters. Hardly worth the $9.75 I was charged. Also the large orange juice was in a small glass. Are you guys going off European measurements? The only thing I actually enjoyed was the bacon, cause how can you really mess that up.  Well, this place is over hyped and the wait is just not worth the wait. I'd recommend going to Black Bear instead. They only get 3 out of 5 stars for the customer service and the bacon. But, I might just be feeling generous today."}
{"text":"Corned beef hash = a smash! Service so gracious, in a dining room that's spacious Enough for baby to take a stroller snooze.   I was in Tempe for work and had my infant with me; of course she woke up on East Coast time and I knew I would need a hearty breakfast and espresso to start the day. Snooze was a short walk from my hotel and opens at 6:30 am (thank goodness!). My waitress was so sweet, tucked me and the stroller in a corner, and was very attentive throughout my meal. My cappuccino was really good - miles beyond espresso in New England brunch places. The corned beef hash was spicy, filling, and delicious, and the young man who brought it to my table said, \"I hope you enjoy!\" What more could I want out of this experience? I just wish there were a Snooze in Providence!"}
{"text":"The food is very good here! That's not the problem. Their service is all over the place. During our breakfast we had no less than 4 people coming by dropping stuff off. Not necessarily the worst thing but it comes off impersonal. Maybe that's just their way. My Eggs Benedict was not correct so they took my plate away then removed the wrong Bennie and brought back my original plate so I could eat what was left. Later, they brought the replacement Benedict on a separate plate after I was pretty much finished with my meal. Again, not the worse thing but they should have just re-fired the whole plate. Sort-of cheesy. The last thing that concerns me about Snooze is the noise level! This place is loud!! Like 98-100db loud (sound App) . That's the same as a jet plane or a chainsaw. If we hadn't already ordered our food we would have left. I looked up what it says about these noise levels and the employees should only have about 2-4 hours exposure max. My ears were ringing after we left. If you want a nice quiet breakfast forget about Snooze. Foods great but there is a slight downside. At least for us."}
{"text":"My brother found this place, and we went while I was in Phoenix on business. Have only eaten there once, but the huevos rancheros was awesome. The servers were attentive but left us alone to visit, and we didn't wait more than a couple of minutes. (But it was a Thursday at 9 am.) Loved it, will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"As usual this place is awesome. This has become one of our favorite breakfast spots! It's generally crowded here as well it should be because the food is amazingly delicious, the staff is friendly and upbeat, and the environment is perfect. There's a front and rear patio and the restaurant is the perfect spot whether you're looking to do a family breakfast, a more personal am date, or even a business brunch. I've even brought my laptop and worked here for a bit.  Today we came in for my birthday and our server was Matt. Matt was courteous, pleasant, and even patient with me in my indecisive state to figure out what I wanted. Yeah, I admit at times I'm one of them? I'll stare at the menu and may change my order at least twice before you leave (especially if I check out the food going to another table)!  We ordered the Snooze Classic and of course added the sinful pancake and a French toast. It was delicious and they were perfect portion sizes! Omg! If you haven't been here yet you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Aw geeze this place is precious. Retro decor and the sweetest servers. I had a Benedict with smoked salmon and rye toast mmmm so good. But the Queen Dish of this spot is their French toast!!! Omgggg not the \"neat toast\" but the other one that was stuffed with creamy goodness and topped with strawberries and dried coconut. I was in heaven."}
{"text":"Noise is overwhelming, from the clatter of dishes to the conversations and the non-stop blare of hip hop music. Breakfast burrito was good, but was served 10 minutes after my boyfriend had finished his breakfast. Waitress comped the drinks! Very friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Scrumptious!!!!!  Met friends on a Friday around 9a for bkfst.  No wait.  We all shared the OMG french toast.  And OMG is an understatement.  So good we were fighting over the last bite.  Order ranged from a simple egg and bacon bkfst to the breakfast burrito which was gigantic!  The eggs benedict chilaquilas was delish!  Both the green chile sauce and the red chile sauce were yummy. The caramel latte and their regular coffee was outstanding.  The vibe of the restaurant was great.  Acoustics a little on the loud side but the place was nonstop.    Service was also good.  Will defo be back and find a reason to make the trek!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place have not had good experiences at the hotel and restaurant we went to yesterday... decided to try out this place before we left Phoenix and we are so happy we did I have the French toast which was unbelievable my husband had the eggs Benedict he said it was he best he has ever had... eating breakfast from NY, NJ, NC Nashville, FL, TX ...this is by our favorite breakfast place! Staff is awesome too we had Dre and she was so sweet and attentive"}
{"text":"I've been to both locations before and the food is always fantastic, so no complaints there. Because I loved it so much, I brought my mom yesterday to the Tempe location.   The food was outstanding as always, but the service was pretty terrible. In fact the last time I went to the Tempe location I had the same server and thought that the service was bad, but it was very busy so I cut the guy some slack. Yesterday, however, was not busy and the service was still poor. So poor in fact my mom doesn't want to go back because of how awkward and uninviting our server was.  As I'm writing this I looked on my receipt for his name and noticed that it says: Hotline Bling. Guess that's the kind of service I should expect from a name like that."}
{"text":"Ok...four of us for breakfast, on a busy Saturday morning.  Our server was pleasant. Beverage orders were delivered quickly, breakfast orders were placed. Three of our plates arrived. The fourth \"is coming right out\". Our server came by to ask how everything was...\"fine, but we are still missing the fourth dish\". She did not seem concerned nor did she apologize. The hostess/floor manager came to say that the order was coming out shortly. She did apologize for the delay. The fourth item finally arrived about 10 to 15 minutes after the first plates were delivered.  The up side was that the food was very good and they comped the delayed fourth plate. The down side is the lack of concern shown by the server and that we had to ask for coffee refills."}
{"text":"Met my girlfriend here around 12 noon.  Very clean and well decorated.  Everyone was pleasant.  Fresh food at fair price.  Nice booths and bar.  Will surely go back.  Their menu and website explains it all very well."}
{"text":"It was so nice to have breakfast in Phoenix and not have to wait an hour for a table!  Perhaps there will be a wait once this joint is fully discovered.  Maybe I shouldn't be leaving a review?  Whatever.  I had the Chilaquiles Benedict... so good.  I literally could have licked the plate.  I almost had to take it down to four stars because the waitress was a little TOO attentive.  Then I kinda wondered if that was such a bad thing.  In a day and age when you are lucky if the server would even spit on you if you were on fire, the over-server wins.  That and the place was totally adorable inside.  Oh!  If you aren't a fan of tables with chairs, this place is all booths.  You'll love it.  Go.  Eat.  Be the chubby kid on the playground!"}
{"text":"I have had breakfast during the work week several times at this location. Food is generally pretty good. Service is pretty good. Coffee is hot and good.... BUT..... For some reason, possibly because the staff are all young and in shape, they keep the place at a temperature best described as steamy. I don't get it. I have commented several times that it is hot and humid in there, and nothing changes. I literally leave there damp  - and have to sit in my car with the air on high for five minutes to stop sweating.   I don't care how good the food is - not going back - it is not worth the swamp experience!"}
{"text":"Been going here once a week for months and really like it always bring my family and have a great breakfast and good service. Went today and that all changed so so fast. Service to start was slow for a Monday but I am ok with that. My bacon had hair on it and by breakfast pot pie had raw sausage in it. When I cut a piece open it was pink and cold. Sent them both back and bacon came back fine not sure if it was the same bacon - the hair but I ate it. The pot pie came back out and cut a piece open and same thing. The waiter explain that per the manager that is the way it is the cook it once and then reheat it. Sausage should never be pink and cold. The manager did not even feel the need to come talk to me. Well lost a very regular customer."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place although the wait times are forever. Never been disappointed with the food or service though! Plus my server added some Baileys to my hot chocolate. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for breakfast our brunch. The food here overall has great flavor and textures. The staff is friendly and attentive. The Ham Benedict III is quite  excellent. Then hollandaise sauce has a great balance that is not overly tart. The pineapple upside down and sweet potato pancakes are light and fluffy. I was not impressed by the pretzel bun. This is a great place to come and enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend to visit my fianc√© and we went here for brunch on Sunday morning with the family. I knew Snooze was popular so I was anticipating a wait, which only turned out to be about 45 minutes. Once we got seated, our waitress, Spencer, greeted us with much enthusiasm. Great coffee, entrees, and breakfast drinks. The food came out very quickly and was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend the Bella! Bella! Benny, it was phenomenal. If you're lucky enough to get a seat in a booth you've really lucked out, they are very cozy! Definitely worth the wait, staff is friendly and inviting, and the food was terrific! I will be coming back here very soon!!"}
{"text":"The Pancake Flight was the best decision I'll have made my entire vacation here in AZ. As I debated between sweet dishes (my go-to at every breakfast restaurant) I noticed the option to try three different ones. I got the pineapple upside down pancake, blueberry danish pancake, and the OMG French toast. I was stoked to find out that you can choose 2 pancakes and 1 French toast for your options! All three were absolutely decadent. The pineapple upside down cake was probably my favorite as I am bias toward pineapple anything, but the OMG French toast was something special too. My bacon came out crispy as I asked, and my iced caramel latte was good but nothing unique. My grandpa ate every bite of his corned beef hash, and my grandma enjoyed her breakfast pot pie however wasn't a huge fan of the gravy. Regardless, my meal was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Our waiter was a joy as well. I wish we had one of these where I live!!"}
{"text":"Fun food and staff  My wife and I used to live near the original Snooze in Denver and were fans.  So, my wife was stoked when I surprised her and our girls with a visit to their new location in Phoenix.  She actually hit me and gave me an arm hug.  It's everything I remember... minus the big mural outside.  Snooze is fun, quick (apart from the lines), and high-energy.  The staff is always pleasant while orders hit your table without a lot of waiting, making it easy with kids.  The pancake, waffle, and french toast options are always worth blowing your diet on.  I really enjoy their breakfast tacos with chorizo and a dousing of Tapatio.  Definitely a place to take your spouse and/or family for an enjoyable start to the day.  And the balloon guys was really good with our daughter.  She loves her mermaid."}
{"text":"This place was spectacular. The atmosphere, the service, and the food were all excellent. My first visit was yesterday, and I am already planning my next trip over there (I live in SE Gilbert).   I had coffee and the Green Eggs and Hamwich with a side of hash browns. My son had scrambled eggs, sausage links, and a chocolate chip pancake. Everything was delicious. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Such a great place to have breakfast. I had the Benny duo 2 choices - the ham Benny and chililetos (beef) Benny. OMG both excellent but my fav was the beef one w pico de gillo and crispy hash. Hubby had the pancake flight with peanut butter, the house special berry and peach cobbler pancakes. The peach cobbler one was my fav too.   Staff is friendly and helpful if you don't know what you want. Outdoor seating is available too. Very retro decor.  Plus coffee is the best! Nice and strong."}
{"text":"Nice hipster breakfast spot in the heart of Tempe. We went Saturday afternoon around 1pm. Our hostess was very pleasant and seated us right away. 5 Star for Kaitlyn our server she was on point the entire time. Damn I'm still buzzed from the cold pressed coffee. The wife got Juan's tacos with bacon and they were awesome. The bacon was crispy and meaty. They carry Sriracha and that's the extra kicker I needed. I had the pancake flight, pineapple, strawberry, and blueberry. They were all good but the blueberry was by far the best. The portion size was small for $9. I would have paid whatever for bigger portions. If not for the taco my wife shared with me, I would have left hungry. The reviews are spot on about how loud it is. It's hard to carry on a conversation and not be overwhelmed with overhearing your neighbors plans for the day/night."}
{"text":"Best breakfasts ever!  Gluten free pancakes, friendly staff, always a treat to eat here!"}
{"text":"This place has got a lot going for it. It's in a great location, it has a wonderful patio area with games you can play while you wait and the food well prepare. I had the OMG French toast and it was as good as promised. The portion size was generous, I have left overs and it was served promptly. I can definitely see this being a favorite AM spot of mine - when it cools down- the wait for a table inside was a bit long and the patio does have some shade and misters - those just don't stand up in the middle of a Arizona summer- I also thought the decor was really fun and comfortable. They should consider doing after the party hours and letting that great patio get some play."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and had an amazing experience. The food was delicious and our server, Dee, was amazing. I asked her for multiple suggestions and she knew her stuff. Everything she suggested was delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here while I was in Arizona for a work trip. I went on a Wednesday morning so there was no wait but the place was still full. Service was quick and friendly. The menu is quite extensive but I went with the classic breakfast plate. (Should've gone with my go to eggs benedict lol). Anyway, food was amazing...I especially loved the hasbrowns they have..seasoned very well! This is probably one of my favorite brunch places I have been to...now they just need to open in Northern California!!!"}
{"text":"One hour wait, but worth it! Come hungry, servings are big. The only thing, our bacon was slightly burnt, but will return next time we are in town again!"}
{"text":"So my mom and my sister and I are visiting my other sister who now lives here, and our sister loves this spot so she brought us here directly after she picked us from the airport. She's been raving about how this is her favorite breakfast place and said we have to eat here. I have to say, this place definitely didn't disappoint and now i know why she eats here constantly. We had Aily as our server... OMGGGG she is the sweetest!!!!! She catered to us from beginning to end and even brought us a complimentary pineapple upside down pancake because she heard us debating back and forth about whether we should order it, because all the food options looked so good that we couldn't decide. Definitely delicious! We forgot to take pics of our food because we legit devoured it when It touched our table... THE FOOD WAS SOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS! so we're here for a week, and we already decided we want to have breakfast here a few more times before we leave... with Aily as our waitress! The entire staff was incredibly accommodating and we didn't have reservations but they sat us outside as we asked in 4 minutes. Speedy, friendly, service and amazing food. HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE READING THIS TO EAT HERE!   With love from Philly"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast place we've been to, plus they also have restaurants in Colorado as well"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch today. Can't complain about the food. All our dishes were delicious! Service was deserving of a 2 star so the food really helped you on this review. I understand it's 102 outside and the outside tables probably aren't the ones you want to check up on. But geez. Drinks forgotten... Coffee forgotten... Get charged wrong on the bill then confronts me like I'm wrong but then offers to remove the whole charge?? I didn't want it removed I was fine paying what it said I would be charged on the menu. I didn't even have her waste her time rebilling me. We just left. Bloody Mary's were gross too. Casinos make a better Bloody Mary than this spot."}
{"text":"Food was good Service was mediocre, no coffee or water refills??  Maybe it was determined that the cool weather didnt require?  It was disappointing that the service was poor as the food was good"}
{"text":"We've been to the Snooze in San Diego and it's way better than this one. We checked in, and hour wait, honestly very typical and usually worth it. So went next door to shop. Got the text to our table was ready and to see the hostess within 5 minutes. There was a woman ahead of me asking the hostess tons of questions so by the time I checked in with her it had been SIX minutes after the text and our table was already given to someone else, the hostess kept repeating that it was because we hadn't gotten back to them, I showed her my phone stating it had only been 6 minutes and she clearly saw me waiting to speak with her prior to that. Now we're seated, ordered pineapple juice and got apple juice. Our waitress probably couldn't hear us because of the ridiculously loud music playing  (not like the Snooze in San Diego where the background music is just that, in the background).  Food came out, lukewarm at best and the toast was NOT toasted. Hmm, cold breakfast meat. Will probably never return unless we're in San Diego. Get it together Phoenix Snooze."}
{"text":"Really great place for breakfast or brunch, but it's really loud in there! I went in with my mom for the first time a few weeks ago and the music was so loud that it was difficult for us to talk to each other. And at 8 AM in the morning I really don't need loud music anyway. The food was great and the service was wonderful and I might go back once it cools off and I can sit outside but the loudness inside may keep me from going there in the future."}
{"text":"Snooze is always pack regardless of the location. From time to time, we luck out getting seats at the bar. There are only 3 items that we get because they are unique. The Chile verde benedict, benny duo and shrimp & grits. They used to have green eggs and ham on a croissant, wish they would bring that back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dining experience at Snooze. The wait staff was friendly. I ordered blueberry danish pancakes instead of following my first mind and getting regular pancakes. I didn't care for them. The pancakes themselves lacked flavor and the toppings weren't sweet. I would've rather had the addition of maple syrup and butter. I did love the lemon cream, however. It was tasty. I also ordered scrambled eggs that were cooked as ordered and pork belly bacon. The bacon was super good. My almond milk cappuccino was creamy and strong with a cinnamon sprinkle on top. My breakfast was right around $21.  There seemed to be a diverse crowd of happy diners. The staff were having fun with each other and the customers. The decor was cute.  I would definitely go back. I saw a yummy sounding chai drink on the menu that I'd love to try."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with stellar wait staff, delicious food, and top-notch coffee.   WAIT TIME For me, there was none. I woke up stupidly early this morning, and I noticed that Snooze would be open in a matter of minutes, so I went. I was a little surprised to find that many people were already seated and having their breakfast. I strongly recommend coming within that first hour. I've seen the restaurant past 8-9 AM, and it can certainly get packed-- a testament to the quality of this restaurant, no doubt.  COFFEE This itself requires its own category, for it was not only the clay cup (is that clay? It felt like clay.... either way, the insulation was superb), or the undeniable heat despite being poured from a carafe (I tend to be wary). This coffee tasted like it was freshly pressed. All the essential flavors were abundant in this bold, smokey bounty. If you're one for black coffee, you won't be disappointed.   THE BREAKFAST Their entire menu is impressive -- see for yourself -- and, to my delight, they sport a diverse variety of Eggs Benedicts, including a 50/50 (two different kinds of Benedicts) should you have trouble deciding on one. I have attached a photo of my order: the Steak and Eggs Benny; not the best quality photo, but look at this presentation! Every element of this dish is good and necessary: the traditional English muffin is replaced with cheese grit cakes, an unexpected yet highly workable twist. The steak medallions, albeit farther along the spectrum to wellness, yield just the right amount of juiciness. Even the hash browns, which I tend to cast aside for dryness or flavorlessness, are lively with perfect texture.   THE SERVICE Expect to be gregariously welcomed and treated well. The wait staff brightened my morning with their swift and friendly service. As I wrapped up my meal, I was thinking about how nice it would be to have an extra cup of coffee for the road, when my waiter offered a to-go cup. Thus I am led to believe the wait staff can also read minds.   Snooze An AM Eatery, though its name predisposes itself to insufferable puns, is a talented, well-managed restaurant well worth every minute and dollar. In my endeavor to try every breakfast venue within a 10-mile radius of my home in Tempe, I submit that I should have saved this one for last. It is unclear if I will find another breakfast spot in Tempe that will capture my enthusiasm like this one did, and for that, I say thanks...and see you again soon."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here for forever.... But the few times we tried, it was an hour wait... No thanks!!   Now that the newness has died down, I met my cousin here for breakfast at 8 am. No wait! :).   I was torn because I was told their pancakes were delicious, but I didn't want to just eat pancakes. I love eggs Benedict, but I didn't want to give up my hash browns for a pancake...... The waitress let me know there were options! So I ended up w 1/2 order of the Bella! Bella! Benny and hash browns and added a blueberry Danish pancake.  My cousin let me try her Benny Goodman also! Everything was tasty.    Service was good. But it was a little loud in there.   I'll be back to try more goodness :)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I've been to! Incredible food, light and modern ambience. The sweet potato pancakes are to die for! Joe was our server and he did an AMAZING job. Coffee is great, and the wait is typically longer than 30 minutes. Overall, would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"A variety of benedicts to choose from and delish pancake varieties.   Corned beef hash is tasty, traditional eggs benedict is nothing great, but the salmon version is excellent. PB Cup pancake boasts fab peanutbutter flavor with a home-made PB drizzle."}
{"text":"From start to finish PERFECTION. Our server Jessica was absolutely delightful . She knew everything and more about the menu and was spot on with her recommendations. The food not only danced with flavors it did a tango in my mouth. A well orchestrated symphony with each and every bite!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great breakfast brunch spot! Quinoa bowl was so full of flavor and filling. My family got the benny duos with chilaquiles, and chile verde, and raved about them. our waitress, Olivia, was so down to earth and professional. We loved her! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I wouldn't have such a hard time waiting if the staff was actually hospitable. It felt like an inconvenience asking anyone for anything, and the trend seems to be that people walk away when you need something. Food is good, atmosphere as well, but I would not come back for the service."}
{"text":"I can't believe people wait 90 minutes to eat here. Maybe it was just an off day but I was disappointed. Bad service and bad food. If you can't cook eggs correctly, than you have no business serving breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch this morning before dropping my brother off at the airport and all I can say is amazing!!!! Healthy food super filling and the staff was more then sweet as soon as we walked in the front door!!! We will definitley be back!! It's a shame we didn't get out servers name because her and the hostess were as sweet as pie"}
{"text":"What a fun place. Food was awesome! I had the BEAT Sammie. Delicious! The others in the group had pancakes and tacos also awesome. Didn't have a cocktail but they also looked amazing.  Service was a bit slow but overall great place."}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in Phoenix. From ambiance to staff to food it was all 10/10. You have to try the drunken monkey pancakes, it was heaven. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"on the real, this place is tits. the chocolate chip pancakes will put you in a food coma that will render you completely useless for the remainder of your sunday afternoon. the wait time is pretty jewish, but the delicious grub and abundance of trim is well worth it."}
{"text":"Totally worth getting up early to beat the lines at this place... Amazing, creative food and a fun atmosphere. Bloody Mary's are fantastic! Ashley went out of her way to make recommendations, substitutions, and anything else we needed to make this a great brunch experience. Wonderful place and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went twice with my daughter and order the Ham Bene twice because the first time, the egg was over cooked--not running at all, so I decided to give them a second chance.  Unfortunately, two times wasn't a charm, it was still overcooked....  I should've stuck with the french toast I was lynching off my daughter's OMG French toast.  The hollandaise sauce and brioche on the bene was great, thought.  Coffee was okay."}
{"text":"All of my friends love this place. I've been twice. This second time I got the OMG french toast. I was expecting more. It was a waste of money for the quantity of food you get and too expensive. I haven't been back and don't plan to. Head to Over Easy, Joe's Farm Grill, The Farmhouse, heck go get a breakfast jack from Jack in the Box instead. The amount of time you'll waste waiting to get a table isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Tempe is a gorgeous city.  This place was so relaxed and the staff seemed very happy. This placed rocked! I had the huevos rancheros and it was delicious.  Every meal that came out - I wanted.  Check this place out if you're in the area. Go ASU!"}
{"text":"The food was great but I ordered a breakfast burrito and it came with green chili, I asked for gravy instead and then when asked if I wanted to add a meat I chose steak. When the bill came they charged me an extra $3 for gravy, and an extra $10 for the steak... when I asked they took it down to $5 the \"fancy meats\" were a $3 add on but steak wasn't and option. If I would have known that steak and gravy would cost an extra $8 to a $9 burrito I wouldn't have gotten it. The service was okay but they should tell people how much the add on would be."}
{"text":"Reservations - None taken so expect a wait.  Service - Stellar. Even got a cup of ice for my juice without me asking!  Food - Very good 1. Pancake Flight - In order of yumminess: Chocolate chip cookie dough special, Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes, and plain blueberry pancakes. Light, fluffy, sweet but not overly. 2. Breakfast Pot Pie - I did add mushroom and a layer of spinach on top.  Very good.  Not overly indulgent. 3. Snooze Spuds Deluxe - Least favorite.  Just a lot of potatoes and toppings.  Needed a sauce."}
{"text":"Best Eggs Benedict that I have ever tried!  The winners are: Chile Verde and Chilaquiles Benedicts!  They have majorly cute Winnie the Pooh look alike tiny honey pots of espresso! Good!  Super cute atmosphere. Great service. A bit of a wait to get seated but its ok cause I just went down the plaza to Nordstrom rack to shop while I waited. They text/call you when you're table is ready."}
{"text":"A very nice restaurant, with amazing service and food.  Coworkers and I decided to hit this place up because it was on our way to a meeting.    When we first walked in we were amazed how busy it was, it was about 89% filled.  In our heads we knew this place was going to be amazing.  The restaurant was clean, and looked super modern, which was cool.  The bathroom was super clean, you can tell they took care of it!!  You could probably eat in there if you wanted.  Service was quick and excellent.  The staff was fast, efficient and attentive.  I ordered the a benedict with ham, and it was absolutely amazing.  Unlike any benedict I had before.  So if you want a benedict come here and get your benedict fix.  I don't remember what my two coworkers ordered but they did get coffee and loved it, and even took some with them in the fancy cup.    Overall a great breakfast food type restaurant, the only draw back to this place is probably the prices.  Fortunately for us one of my coworker's dad is a doctor and we used his black looking credit card.  So be sure to thank a doctor!!"}
{"text":"Get here before 8 on weekends, or learn to enjoy the waiting list.  Overall, very happy to have this fancy breakfast eatery in the 'hood. All ingredients were prime, from the coffee to the side of fruit and everything in between. The interior decor is flawlessly hip-retro, and the table service is more than adequate.  Since time immemorial, breakfast restaurants counted on making money on volume and turnover rather than margin. But now at the upper end of the breakfast market, it seems they are pushing more to increase margins, as in $9 for 3-ingredient omelette with a side of hashbrowns. The meats on the side (including very good sausage) are an extra $2.50-$3.50. So count on, like, $15 for an omelette, a side of bacon, and a cup of coffee. Throw in a tip and . . . well . . . did you say you were on an expense account? Was that what I heard?  You don't come here to save money, but it still counts as a good value."}
{"text":"Excellent burrito. Excellent OMG French toast. Excellent pancakes. Friendliest hostess, but not the best server. Vibes are easy to read, and unfortunately we felt our server was not happy to be there."}
{"text":"The best food hands down! The girls here are great!!! The pancakes are fantastic, and the eggs Benedict are perfect . Amy and Katie are the sweetest girls ever"}
{"text":"This is my third visit. The food is always good. I love the espresso bar and the added fixings to your entrees, especially the barbacoa!  Unfortunately, this visit was stressful. We were seated outside next to the outdoor games. The kids and commotion made it difficult to enjoy our breakfast. Even my own kids were bothered by it. I recommend this restaurant but I will wait to be seated INSIDE next time. I was bummed because it was excited to take my family here for the first time and they didn't enjoy it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Quality food, yummy food, awesome service! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just left here for a Sunday breakfast with my boyfriend. Food was good, eggs weren't the best though. Came in and immediately sat at the bar, our server was over promptly to get our drink orders. The place was overly crowded and half the people in there were standing either right behind where you were sitting and eating basically breathing down your neck and there was no room to move. Once our waitress came back with our drinks she took our order and left. About 15 or so minutes go by and we got our food. Now we had no expectations specially since we were getting breakfast on a Sunday morning but, having all your customers wait to be seated right by people eating is beyond annoying. Now if we would've waited for a booth or a table the wait was right around 30-50 minutes and it would've been fine to wait except we were hungry and the bar had openings eating so we jumped on that. Maybe try having people sit outside after they checked in so that your entrance area isn't so jammed pack? Which is also a fire hazard having so many people stand in front of the only exit way..."}
{"text":"The food was just okay... I had the eggs benedict. Way to expensive for the quanity and quality of the food. If your looking for unique breakfast items that cost way too much this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"The corned beef hash I have been missing since I left Denver is now in PHX! Made me do a little Irish jump and punch a hole in my wall. Hey, I'm Irish, I can say that! Snooze finally made it's way to Phoenix and it didn't take long for the Colorado transplants to find it as well as the breakfast foodies. Now if we could only get Root Down and Sassafras here.   Now prepare yourself for a 30 to 45 minute wait for a table, but the complimentary coffee does help pass that time. Whether you are a pancake breakfast glutton or a hung over savory breakfast bum like me Snooze will have everything to get that morning fix.   Service here is just as good as the food. We had a couple mix ups with drink orders, but that never bothers me. Take some time and figure out your choice from the large menu, don't worry if you wanted to try a couple things, you'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've dined here half a dozen times or more. The food is creative and a fresh take on a breakfast menu.   Service, however, is severely lacking. I completely understand a longer wait for weekends and holidays.   I've been quoted 2 hours and 15 minutes for Snooze. We mostly eat here on weekdays and it's still 30-45 minutes. The longer wait usually attributes to their \"text\" system which I've never received, only to have my table given away because I wasn't aware it was ready.   Today, around 10am on Friday, we were third in line at the hostess stand. The first couple was quoted 30 minutes. While the next person was getting checked in, we waited several minutes before a hostess even spoke with us as she was conversing about class schedules rather than inputting us into a wait list.   Meanwhile during this conversation a two top approached the hostess stand and was sat immediately.   With so many breakfast restaurants in the area, I'll gladly drive farther to be seated in a timely and orderly manner and negate hostess favoritism."}
{"text":"I dream about the food from Snooze. It is extremely busy on the weekends, so we get there when it first opens on Sunday mornings. The patio seating is lovely. The service is always good, and the food is amazing! We always have the eggs Benedict and the flight of pancakes (all of the pancakes are amazing). If I could give six stars, I would. Well worth the calories!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, I had the tacos and my wife had the classic. First of all, the ingredients were extremely fresh, very tasty, and well prepared.   Great friendly service too.   Net, go here."}
{"text":"I love snooze, this isn't my first time coming here but I think it's time for a review! I usually end up getting an omelet but this time ordered the snooze spuds deluxe and the OMG French toast, and this will be my go to combo from now on to share with a friend of course! Everyone is always so friendly here and the ambiance keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"If I'm anything, I'm a breakfast enthusiast. Which is why I LOVE to find places like Snooze when I travel. We faced a pretty long hour+ wait on a Sunday even with school out of session. Fortunately they text you when you're up, so you aren't tied down. Now let me tell you, deciding what to order at Snooze was probably the hardest decision I've made in 2016. But it was my first day in Arizona, so Juan's Breakfast Tacos it was. My cohorts indulged in the Benny Duo option, which I envied. Fortunately almost everything comes with hollandaise, so I was consoled. Long story short, this is a world class breakfast-ery. Go."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday morning. Our party of two waited about 15 minutes. The host and waitress were great - very friendly. Food was amazing, too. Wife ordered the blueberry danish pancakes with scrambled eggs on the side and loved them. I ordered the corn beef hash with eggs over easy and an English muffin. It was delicious! Coffee is brewed fresh and they also serve adult beverages, freshly squeezed orange juice, and iced teas."}
{"text":"The trio pancake breakfast was great. The pancake batter is delicious! My favorite of the three pancakes I tried had to be the chocolate infused one. The wait to get in was significant but worth it. The staff is friendly, attentive, and efficient."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place I have eaten at in years. Nick was our waiter.  We had Pineapple pancakes ...dual eggs Benedict, and the most awesome breakfast burrito.  The bloody Mary's were awesome also"}
{"text":"I love snooze, especially the one on Camelback, but this place wasn't that good, at least this time.  The wife and I were returning books at the ASU Tempe campus and decided to try this place out to see which one is better.  Needless to say, it wasn't that good.  The server was nice, but it took forever to get our food.  The restaurant wasn't even that packed, so I could imagine if it was.  Now on to the food, which was really good and yummy, but not worth the price.  I had the OMG french toast, which costs almost 10$ by the way, and I was disappointed with the amount of food they gave me.  At the camelback snooze, I got nearly triple the food.  For 10$ I expect to not be hungry when I leave, but I guess that is the Texan in me.  Then to top it off, my wife found an eyelash on top of her pancake.  I know this kind of thing happens in the food business, but it surely made our visit less pleasant.  Overall, if you want snooze I would avoid this one and go to the one in Phoenix instead."}
{"text":"The food here is to die for!  Every time I make a trip up to Phoenix, the wife and I stop by here.  The place is clean and the service is pretty good here.  It can get packed, but you can call ahead and they even text you when your table is ready.  I get the blueberry pancakes, which are awesome.  The wife gets the pancake flight, which is a sample of three pancakes and she loves it.  Overall, it's a nice place to eat breakfast in the Valley.  Please come down to Tucson!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, server was fine but I can't get over the absurdly long wait and rude host staff. We visited on a Sunday, had a party of two and were told we would have a 35 minute wait. Try an hour and twenty! We inquired twice about how much longer it would take and were told that we were the next party of two, only to watch another party of two be seated ahead of us. When I asked why we couldn't be seated at the booth that had been sitting open for several minutes, I was told that they wouldn't seat us there because we could only have a two top. Not to mention all three hostesses I encountered were snarky and dismissive. I am so disappointed, I don't mind waiting for good food but I expect a little respect in return. Management should review their policies and find some new staff."}
{"text":"The best breakfast and service you can ask for. The food was amazing and it was big portions as well. They always came up and made sure we were ok and enjoying the food. Flip was our server and he was the best. Always in a good mood and just overall a very happy person. Would come here again and again."}
{"text":"I got the OMG French toast. They best French toast I ever ate. So delicious !!!  & also the breakfast tacos so delicious.  & Goodman Benedict. Kinda more on creamy side. But still good   Great service too :)  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"OMG in general describes the food here! We were in town for a few days and now have eaten here 2x. (We tried for 3 but the wait on a Sunday was ~60 min.The servers and hosts/hostesses are to notch too. Well worth the wait to get in. Highly recommend. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty and big portions...a real value for the money. The staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Coffee Pancake Flight: Pineapple Upside Down - Buttermilk pancakes with caramelized pineapple chunks, housemade vanilla cr√®me anglaise and cinnamon butter Drunken Punk'n - Our homemade pumpkin with a cream cheese filling, topped with bourbon infused maple syrup, sweet cream drizzle and maple spiced pepitas Blueberry Danish - Buttermilk pancakes topped with blueberry coulis, sweet cream and almond streusel surrounding a center of lemony cream cheese filling Sister Fig's French Toast - Fresh Brioche¬†griddled with fig preserves and Tallegio cheese and topped with blood orange syrup, caramel and walnut streusel  One of several Arizona locations spawned by a chain out of Colorado, Snooze \"An AM Eatery\" was visited for early brunch on New Years Day as a result of two things, the first a recommendation from a trusted Chef back in Las Vegas and the second a simple matter of convenience as none of the local mom n' pop shops were open for the holiday.  Small and kitsch, the d√©cor and color scheme harkening a 1970s kitchen while servers bounced around in New Years Eve party hats, it was moments after 7am that I arrived at the sizable Town & Country eatery, no line at such an early hour and seating offered immediately.  Espousing \"Green\" ethics while filling the menu with words like \"Local,\" \"Seasonal,\" and \"Community,\" Snooze offers a menu of \"Fresh Twists on American Classics\" and proudly telling as story of Fair Trade Coffee practices yielding an exclusive roast from Guatemala there is really no questioning the restaurant's ethics, though with such things comes a price higher than the typical restaurant chain while service is so laid back that it almost seems - at times - disinterested.  Eventually flagging down a young lady busy flirting with a fella sporting a man-bun to take my order, two plates and coffee that essentially required begging to be refilled totaling just under $25 before tip, it was no more than fifteen minutes before the kitchen sent plates forth, the portions somewhat smaller than would be anticipated considering the prices and the results 'fine,' though certainly nothing to write home about.  No doubt a bit more interesting than IHOP or Denny's, and additionally offering 'flights' of Bennies and Pancakes that allow diners to dabble without overinvesting on one plate, it was with three style flapjacks that the tasting got underway and with syrups only blending somewhat the \"Pineapple Upside Down\" was still somewhat oddly flavored, the texture actually surprisingly dry while blueberry and Pumpkin were better textured with unique syrups bolstering the taste.  Faring better than the Pancakes and doing an admirable job in sourcing brioche from local artisan Bread & Cie it was next in the Sister Fig's French Toast that taste buds were entrusted, the bread itself as good as remembered though a bit more time soaking would have been a personal preference, while  melted cheese and fig preserves walked a tightrope between sweet and salty, the bright syrup dancing equally well to caramelized nut streusel."}
{"text":"Fun and trendy vibe but the food was underwhelming compared to the price. Friendly service and clean environment but not enough to make me return."}
{"text":"So. Freakin. Good. Seriously... worth every penny and every minute you have to wait to get a table. The breakfast tacos are gigantic, and everything in them is delicious and fresh. Pancakes are yummy... Mimosas are great... coffee is great... I don't know what else to say besides everything is good. You have to try it!!"}
{"text":"Snooze is a brilliant execution of a post modern diner done with contemporary twist...or is it a contemporary diner with a post modern twist?    Anyways, like I said before Snooze is brilliant!  Great food (breakfast and salads only), great drinks, incredible staff that are on point and pi√®ce de r√©sistance: they have stevia LOL"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service, and atmosphere!  Takes awhile to get a table, but even that was a great experience with games, seating, free coffee."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing food!!!  They lost our order,  but brought us an amazing pancake dessert to compensate.  Attention to detail and presentation  was great.  A must go!"}
{"text":"Had the corned beef hash which is made in house. Big chunks of corned beef mixed with potatoes topped with two poached eggs. It was one of the best corned beef hash dishes I've had in a long time. Our waitress, Fanny, comped us one of their Blueberry Danish pancakes for our table to try. It was delicious! The service was top notch. Will definitely go back the next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh breakfast foods. Food came out just as ordered for our party of six, and quickly. The unique takes on breakfast aren't too \"hipster-ish or granola\" so I like it. They definitely boast a different menu of the classics without adding fresh mountain alpine arugula or southeastern Cuban coast seaweed to every dish. (Refreshing in a time where people are trying to hard sometimes.)   Atmosphere is very fun and friendly. We experienced a theme day the Sunday we went. It was beach day so the servers were wearing floaties and sunscreen noses. Very nice touch.   Service was phenomenal. Very good team effort/vibe, coupled with quick, attentive service and thorough but timely check backs from our server. It was a small 10 minute wait but this was the off college season. Throw in free weekend covered structure parking right next door and it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow wow. Amazing. Best breakfast I've ever had. I even waited 55 minutes to be seated and it was still worth it. I got the Ham Benedict and Chilaquiles Benedict with their amazing hash browns. The Chilaquiles one was seriously the best Benedict I've ever had. Every single bite of that meal was heavenThe women next to us split the breakfast burrito and I definitely want to try that next time. Also, really wanna try some of their amazing pancake creations. I plan on going back lots more! . I think my favorite part about the restaurant besides the food was the music and vibe inside. It made going to breakfast seem really fun. Really affordable, too!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! Fantastic place for brunch. Show up early because there's always a long line. They text you when a table opens up for you so feel free to walk around, go to the nearby Nordstrom Rack! Food is undeniably amazing (so is the service!) Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious and great service! It took a while to get seated, but it was well worth the wait. The prices are a little high, but what place isn't these days? Good thing I don't live close, or I would be here every weekend! :)"}
{"text":"No waiting area inside and it was too hot to wait outside. The server didn't have the best personality but the girls at the host stand were warm and inviting. It took too long to be sat at our table and it was empty for a while before they sat us there.The food was good. I liked the music they played old school rap. Different vibe from any breakfast place that I have experienced."}
{"text":"Good food but awful service. Our server, \"Paige\", was unattentive and at times, even abrasive. The couple next to us stood up holding their check and credit card just to get her attention. Won't be back to this location solely because of the service experience."}
{"text":"If you don't Snooze.. Then you Looze! Thank you for catering and supporting our Gilbert Leadership issue day for breakfast. It was incredible. I tried the Pineapple Upside Pancakes and they did not disappoint. I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and our local friends took us here for breakfast. Highly recommend the pancake flight so you can taste them all because they are all so delicious! The Benny Goodman is also an amazing take on Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Omg this food is unreal. The hollandaise is to die for and the fact that they have 5 bloody mary's wins over my heart. Definitely my new go to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"There's always a wait but it's defiantly worth it! I love their breakfast tacos and their pancakes are out of this world! The have great coffee and cocktail drinks. One of my favorite breakfast spots! Great vibes and good music!"}
{"text":"Land from Miami saw this spot 13 min away on Yelp and I loveeeed it!! Sweet potato pancakes. They need to open a spot up in Miami"}
{"text":"Great service, cool atmosphere, great location right near campus."}
{"text":"Love love love snooze.  Their OMG French toast is a go to, even though you sound lame saying it. Chilequiles benny (chi-le-key-le, it's an Aztec breakfast), the lox, I haven't found much on the menu I didn't like. The only thing that was kind of a bummer was I wasn't feeling their bloody's, not to say they won't be someone else's cup of tea. Dirty drunken chai, however, v good.  Servers are super cool too. Always incredibly polite, and willing to do whatever they can to make sure it's a good experience."}
{"text":"Too busy for their own good.  We went on a Saturday morning around 8:45 and we were seated in 20 minutes at the bar which was fine.  The problem was that no one took our order or even water for 15 minutes.  We were there 25 minutes and never got our food although people around us arrived later and already had their food.  We left.  The food is supposed to be great.  We will never know.  The employees acted liked they were not trained well and did not know how to keep the flow of people going."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for breakfast there is almost always a wait but it well worth it! Food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Went Friday around 9:30. It was busy and we had a 15 minute wait. It's really loud. I told my mom she wouldn't like it due to not being able to hear well. I had my two year old with me so I think loud restaurants work for us. I had the eggs Benedict. They were very good. I'm eager to try the different variations. My son had the scrambled eggs, hash browns and toast. He was Happy. We had a really friendly server and the food came out fast. The pancakes at the table looked great. I will want to try those next time we go.  The only improvement needed - more attention for coffee refills. My server offered me a coffee to go so that made up for it :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! This isn't only the best brunch spot I've eaten in Arizona, but THE BEST brunch spot I've had in my entire life. I was a lil hungover so don't get me wrong. It's usually a little harder for me to put food down when I am. But boy, I demolished my food. This place, I know I say it often, but I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it. This place is life changing.   I was stuck between two Benedicts and our server let me know I could just do half and half since it comes with two. Thanks homie. I got the Benny Goodman and the Winter Harvest. Nice! Both eggs were perfectly poached. Nice little bounce to the egg feeing like a custard or jello. The chef probably went through a 50 year course on how to poach eggs. Both had a cream cheese hollandaise which was surprisingly good. Nice little tang with a kiss of the sweetness from the cream cheese. It had a really bright taste. Probably a little bit of lemon juice so you don't get that eggy taste to the hollandaise.  Winter harvest had a nice sweet potato polenta topped with a few more veggie/healthy/earth ingredients. Honestly with that perfectly poached egg and sweet tangy hollandaise. You couldn't tell you were being healthy and enjoying the bountiful harvest from Mother Nature.   Now. My favorite Benny. Yo!!! Homie! I'll tell you this. I love Lox. So I'm biased on this. Having a Lox Benedict! You win me over. Everything was nice. Salmon was smokey not too fishy. Everything had a nice ratio. The best Benedict I've ever eaten. I hate rye bread. I loved having rye on this.   We got a flight of pancakes. Which is you get to choose 3 flavors. For $9? I forgot what we ordered since I don't really like pancakes. But they were all pretty good for pancakes.   What I do remember out of the pancakes was a the cinnamon bacon one. Bacon is good. Bacon makes everything good. If you're into pancakes. Do this one.    Coffee is okay.   Bloody Marys were good. We had the Bangkok one. Fishsauce, lime, cilantro, sriracha.   We were the only Asians in the restaurant at the time. Maybe in all of Arizona. Our server brought us sriracha as our hot sauce when all the other tables had Tabasco. Funny. He was a cool dude though.   If this was down the street from me. I'd wake up every morning feeling like I won the lotto."}
{"text":"I got here pretty early on a weekday - a little before 8am - and it wasn't crowded at all. However, over the next 90 minutes, the place filled up almost completely. That's a pretty good sign, but also a good thing to keep in mind: if you can get out of bed early, do it and you'll spend far less time waiting and more time EATING!  I started off with coffee, which was hot and had good flavor. It was kept constantly topped off and warm (bonus points!)  I read through the whole menu. Twice. I finally narrowed it down to 4 options and then chose the first one of those (so that it would be easy to keep track of which one I already had ordered -- see? Planning ahead.  I had the corned beef hash with two eggs and rye toast. The corned beef was awesome. If you're also a fan, this is worth it. The Reuben sandwich is probably amazing, too, since I'd imagine it uses the same flavorful, fall-apart beef product and thick-cut rye bread.  Since it was my first time there (I guess this is a thing?), the server brought us a pancake to try. It was their signature pineapple upside down pancake -- that was one of the options on my short list (more bonus points!)... And it was excellent. If you are familiar with places that make heavy pancakes, this is not one of those. The pancake was large, about the size of the plate, but light. The add-ins and toppings weren't overpowering, either. So many times, you'll get a nice pancake, but it is almost floating in syrup, butter, or who-knows-what topping (I'm looking at you, IHOP!). Not so here. I think the ratio was very well balanced.  There is so much good stuff on the menu that I couldn't order it all in one sitting. Well, I could ORDER all of it, but My attempt to EAT all of it would not be pretty ... So, I guess I have to go back (twist my arm, you know?)   Now that I've checked it out, and the weather is cooling off, I am looking forward to taking the family here. Did I mention that they have outdoor seating on the back patio? Woo hoo!"}
{"text":"When I visited Denver over the holidays I tried eating at Snooze but the wait was too long before my flight. So I was wonderfully surprised and delighted when I found out Snooze was coming to Tempe!  I am so glad I never got to have my first time experience at Snooze in Denver because I don't know if they would have been able to live up to the hospitality I received at the Tempe location.    The food was remarkable. Absolutely delicious. I sat at the bar and the servers Adrianne & Tori were fantastic. They even brought us a peanut butter cup pancake on the house! I am a pancake fanatic so this made my dining experience that much more enjoyable!   Two thumbs way up for Snooze! I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The environment is so chill, the food is great and coffee cocktails make this place my favorite brunch spot. The different types of eggs benedict make my day better. My favorite is the Bella! Bella! Benny."}
{"text":"Been here about 6 times. It's never disappointed. My personal favorite is the sweet potato pancakes. I always bring my out of town visitors and everyone loves it. The place gets packed but it's truly worth the wait."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Food is very good.  Love their concept.  I always get a side of bacon.  So good.  Their eggs benedict is great in that you can order two different types which is perfect for someone like me that can never make up their mind!  Hubby had the breakfast burrito.  Could not finish it and it was very good.  We never go on weekends as the wait is too long and my hubby has lots of health issues and cannot wait too long to eat.  Service is always very friendly and efficient.  Outside patio is dog friendly!  Love that."}
{"text":"my little review. Upon entering I was pleasantly surprised at the decor, cool retro (not my fav style), but it impressed me. The waiter was wonderful and upbeat. Right there when we needed him. The hostess which was a guy (what's the name for him? A hoster?) was welcoming as well. Anyway, the booths were comfy and even liked the lighting. food was delish, we shared the breakfast pot pie, which was big enough for two. Very flavorful, the orange juice tasted fresh squeezed although a bit pricy at $4. The only complaint I have it the noise level was very high. They were busy but I've been elsewhere in the same situation and it's been much quieter. Maybe they need some buffer in the walls or ceiling to absorbs noise. Oh and one last cool thing. There's a bar across the front for looking out to the parking lot and the windows swing up and completely out of the way. Reminded me of Brophy's on the Harbor in Santa Barbara. I will be going back to explore more of their menu for sure."}
{"text":"This is the first time my husband and I have eaten here. I got the OMG! French Toast, while my husband got the Spud Deluxe. We were served quickly, his was huge and fit the description perfectly, mine on the other had was 2 slices without any side dishes. It filled my mans hunger with ease while mine filled my sweet tooth (but that's all it filled). Our customer service was ok, she didn't take my empty plate when she came to give us refills but she took it when she gave us our check, but someone else ran our check since she didn't show up for another 5 min. For $9.75 it's more money than it's worth but for my husbands it was $11.50 and was perfect."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable breakfast with very fresh ingredients! Great OJ.  I had the egg white omelette with spinach, mushroom and chorizo, very tasty."}
{"text":"Ambiance and college atmosphere was great. Customer service was A+. Only downside was my food. Read grest things about the pancakes, so I did the sampler option and chose blueberry, the pineapple one, and sugar powder one. They were all...just ok. It could be because I also ordered the green Verde breakfast burrito. It was huge and had a lot of flavor and very filling! If i go again,  i would give the pancakes another try and not order a breakfast burrito at same time..."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Sunday brunch was very good. Prices aren't too bad. The Coffee Doughnut Pancakes are really good. The Chilaquiles Benedict was good, but hoped for better. You know when I restaurant goes the extra mile for quality, Snooze AM does that. Hipster ambiance, which isn't my style, but I don't mind it either. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I got yogurt with granola and it was delicious. I'm going to go here more often. The avocado and toast on the side was great too!"}
{"text":"Fun spot with delicious food. Loved the Bella Bella benedict. Service was good. Interior is a fun diner throwback."}
{"text":"In love with this place. 100% worth the wait. Spuds deluxe is my fav! Nothing better than a bowl full of hashbrowns with 2 toppings of choice. Pretty cheap drinks too :)  I always take out of town guests here and they love it! Last time I came, we celebrated a birthday and they gave us a pancake with sprinkles and a candle. So cute!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast options just ridiculously long wait to get seated. But what can you say. When it's good, the people will follow. Love the pancake flight and their Benedict's options are very tasty."}
{"text":"I at a the Snooze in Denver a few years ago and it was excellent so when I saw one here I kept meaning to try it. Finally went in on Saturday morning and they were packed. Wait was about 30 minutes but there is a lot to do nearby so it's not a problem killing time. The menu was different than the location I ate at but there are a lot of choices. The server was fantastic and she answered all my questions and helped me order what I wanted because my diet is a pain. Everything I tried was awesome. Even items I typically don't like were insanely good and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend loves trying out new places so we gave this a shot. It took an hour and a half to get in which is normally way longer than I'd tolerate to gets some eggs. She got french toast with Bacon and Eggs and I decided on the sausage/egg sandwich. Overall the sandwich was OK,  marginally better than a McMuffin and it came with some hash brown in the shape of a cylinder.. which meant less crunchy outer coating and more gooey insides... I prefer more crunchiness so I didn't each much of it. I tried some of my girlfriends french toast/eggs/bacon. I gotta say... I was pretty disappointed by the bacon as it was nearly flavorless and not good at all. She was not impressed either. Aside from that the rest tasted pretty standard. Overall I'd go back again but only if there was no wait. Though...  I'd probably sooner just go to IHOP or Dennys since they aren't \"hip\" and don't have an insanely long wait and high prices for food of the same quality."}
{"text":"I will never push Snooze on a day I'm heading there!! Watch out for the waiting list but know that it's worth it!!!!!  The food was great! Not just great! Even the side of fruit was great! There was an assorted array of fruit that did not consist of unripe melons!!!   The service was AWESOME!!!! We had two little girls with us and I would say that I would bring my children back!!!    Thank you Snooze for getting me up early on a Sat!"}
{"text":"The food is good! I usually get the spuds with bacon and jalape√±os and one egg weird combo but delicious!! I always get it to go when I'm working early in the am down the street but they are so disorganized at the front for pickups I usually have to wait about 5-10 more mins on top of what they say which suck because I have to go back to work but I usually don't mind but one time they told me it would be up in a couple mins and 20 mins later they realized it had been sitting on the counter since before I even got there"}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Got the Breakfast Pot Pie this time."}
{"text":"We brunch monthly and have attempted to go to Snooze more than once. We finally decided breakfast instead of brunch this weekend and it was WELL worth the wait.  We got there at 9am on a Sunday and still had about a 30 minute wait, however, they send you a text when your table is ready - so you are able to actually leave the premises. The inside is soooooooo freaking adorable, and everyone we encountered was very friendly.  About 10 minutes after we place our order our server arrived with a complimentary Nutella Banana Pancake that was huge and for our table to share.  She just showed up with it! One of our brunchers is 7 months pregnant, and you would have thought she won the lottery.  I'm not a sweet breakfast person, but this was honestly delish.  Everyone enjoyed their meals, the prices are beyond reasonable, and we all decided we need to make this a regular outing on top of our weekly brunches.   OH and I love that they have so many vegetarian options.  Honestly - so happy they opened in PHX and are just around the corner from my home."}
{"text":"A solid four rating....I rarely comment on decor.....but this place has a real nice feel to it.   Wait staff friendly and energetic....and helpful....explained menu items and specials.  Corned beef hash was excellent...eggs cooked to order and very fresh.  And portions just right.....didn't try to cover lack of flavor with sheer volume...  Seemed to be several regulars which is a good sign.  Highly recommend you try Snooze."}
{"text":"i went to Snooze for breakfast with two friends today. I guess I must be missing something. The food was just average, as was the service. We didn't have too long of a wait on a Sunday morning, which was good.  It is very busy so the patrons must enjoy eating mediocre food.  The mimosa was just ok, and the coffee was terrible. Sorry, just not impressed. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice, clean place with good food.   Excellent menu with quality ingredients. The bacon is not the standard thinly sliced 60/40 (fat/meat), it's thickly sliced seasoned meat with not much fat.  I had the 'spuds deluxe' which allows you to choose two of the ingredients. It was quiet good & an ample amount of food without being too much. Coffee is pretty good, as well.  Chilaquiles Benedict, salted caramel pancakes, a slew of breakfast sandwiches, friendly staff...oh yeah, coming back here."}
{"text":"The snooze is great for morning peeps! Great environment for anyone and everyone of all ages. I had a palomimosa \"it's an adult beverage\" it's really good and the only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars is that our waitress didn't put in the order so I had to ask twice! But all in all 4 stars and I highly recommend this place, all the food is good... especially the pineapple upside down pancakes"}
{"text":"Do not eat here. My food had a hair in it, and when I told the waitress, she brought out another dish which also had a hair in it! Absolutely disgusting. And I wasn't even compensated for my meal. The waitress herself was not understanding of the situation either, and was very rude the entire time she was serving us. She didn't even refill our empty water glasses until I called her over to tell her about my dish. Terrible service, and the two hairs ruined the entire meal for me. Never going back."}
{"text":"Best. Pancakes. Ever! First of all, let's take a step back and think about pancakes. Pancakes is a breakfast staple that you don't think too much about, it's as common as eggs or toast, and when you see specialty pancakes on the menu you often see (and come to expect) regular pancakes with some fruit tossed in it. Well, I'm here to report that Snooze changes the pancake makin' game. One, they offer a pancake flight that allows you to taste three of their pancake varieties. Two, they serve you pancakes that focus on the art of cakes, and three, they subsequently ruin all other pancakes you will taste anywhere else. For my selection I chose: Pineapple Upside Down Cake, Sweet Potato, and Coffee and Donut. The Pineapple Upside Down Cake is sweet and delectable with the Sweet Potato also being good, but different. I liked the Coffee and Donut (literally tastes like it sounds), but would recommend the signature Pineapple Upside Down Cake out of the three. In addition, their Bloody Mary's are solid, and it's important to note since the cuisine is so good you almost forget about your beverages. This Snooze location is recognized to serve some of the best Bloody Mary's in the Valley, so if that's your drink of choice you'll be pleasantly content. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've only ever gone on weekends but every time that I have gone there has been a wait. The only reason I'm giving them four stars instead of five is because two times of the many I've been there, the service wasn't the greatest. It took us about 15 minutes after we sat down until we had to ask someone for our order, utensils, and water. Other than that, the food is great, the place is clean, and you can have a group of up to 5 people here."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED LOVED LOVED this place!!! Hidden in a strip mall it doesn't look like much from the outside... Inside though was a different story. The service was outstanding, the servers were friendly and knowledgable. My husband ordered the Bankok Bloody Mary. Amazing! Their AM drink menu is outstanding. My husband ordered the Chilaquiles Benedict. My toes curled in delight. Amazing. I had the breakfast burrito and added bacon to it. The sauce on it was to die for, I mean they brought out the plate and I thought \"this thing is huge, no way I'm finishing it\". Well guess what? I couldn't stop eating. Will come back here again and if I'm ever in Colorado or San Diego, where their other locations are, I'll go there too. I am a fan for life.  Oh and what a great menu! There's something here for everyone."}
{"text":"I love eating at snooze! The food is really yummy and they have quite a few gluten free options for me to choose from. The wait is usually a little long because it's very popular but it's worth it! The blueberry streusel gluten free pancakes are yummy as well as the breakfast tacos in corn tortillas. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Holy cow everything is RIGHT with this place. Service is awesome. Location is great. But the food is a foodies dream!  We had a little of everything and it was all fantastic. It's a good thing we don't live near here or I would weigh 400 lbs."}
{"text":"Well, I'm sick. Walked out of the restaurant 10 minutes ago after eating maybe one eighth of my \"Ham Benedict III\" and I am physically sick. And that's literally not even the only bad part of the experience that I am taking a break from puking right now to write about. I want to make clear that the coffee is decent though, I love a good iced mocha from here, and the barista is doing a good job in the midst of a landfill.  So the waiter literally walked up to us and just stood there and smiled until one of us at the table said, \"Hey how is it going?\". One of the creepiest waiters ever, and then he said, \"Do you want to hear about our pancake?\", we replied with, \"Sure\" and then the guy did not even know what was in the pancake.  Food comes out and nothing better happens. My plate literally smelled like body odor, I don't know if it's just the hollandaise or what, but it was repulsive. Then we don't see the guy forever and then when he comes back and no one has eaten anything but some hash browns, he says, \"Do you guys need a box?\". Our cards are already out and on the table, come on dude no we want to get out of here before we actually puke on the floor.  I have had bad experiences here before with under cooked eggs and just weird guy servers who sit down next to you to take your order but it's just so close to home and school that I keep finding myself going there out of convenience but never again, not after being sick for food that is not even appetizing.  Bottom line is, the food is not good, the service is trash, there is almost always a ridiculous wait which still perplexes me, I would not recommend this place to any one, and honestly, if you don't offer Frank's Red Hot as one of your hot sauces you are already a garbage establishment.  Snooze, when you read this, please leave this location so something better can come in and use the spot. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here FOREVER but it is so hard to get in this place on a Saturday or Sunday morning! We finally had the perfect opportunity this past weekend as we were up early running errands around town.   Our first impressions:  Front hostess was super peppy and warm, not just to us, but to everyone..even as the line grew out the door. Her enthusiasm was contagious!   Casual and laid back retro atmosphere. The Tempe location draws a somewhat versatile crowd but it's truly the perfect spot for families and hung-over twenty-somethings alike.   Our server, Savannah, did a fantastic job. She noted that it was our first time, and treated us to a pineapple upside down pancake which literally left me speechless it tasted so good! I am definitely ordering pancakes next time!  My eggs and chicken sausage plate tasted great - I ordered more on the boring side unfortunately. Mimosa came out pretty quickly and was a solid size for the $6.  Overall, this is a no-brainer 5 star rating for amazing food and even amazing-er (yeah, I just made up a word) service!"}
{"text":"Went to Snooze for Brunch. There was a 30 minute wait as usual with any Brunch spot in downtown Gilbert. This area has become quite popular. Ordered the trio pancake off the menu and everything was Delicious, even though everything sounded extremely sweet, it didn't turn out to be like that at all. The pancakes and toppings was lightly coated and everything tasted balanced.   I also order the Huevos Rancheros. I wasn't impressed. It was 2 pieces of corn tortilla, Rachero sauce on top with some sliced sausage and egg whites. I'd stick with the signature pancakes because they are awesome. I also didn't like how ice coffee wasn't free refills because it's \"cold brew\" but yet hot coffee is free refills. The ice was filled to the brim probably only giving me about 6oz of actual cold brew coffee. It was a rip off. They should charge a little extra for unlimited refills. It's not juice, it's ground coffee for crying out loud."}
{"text":"Snooze seems like the cool hip place to go to when in Phoenix. Our server was Charles and he was very nice. I got the breakfast burrito and my husband got the Oreo pancake with eggs and bacon. The environment is really nice. One thing I noticed is that they don't ask you if you want indoor or outdoor seating. They just sit you wherever. We were seated outside, but it was ok because they had burners all around providing heat. I would most likely come back here when I come to visit AZ again."}
{"text":"Snooze is my favorite breakfast place in Phoenix! I am a big breakfast fan and I always take my friends and family here. I don't think I can count the amount of times I have been here on my fingers and toes. Yeah... it's that good.   They have a wide variety of breakfast items, but here are my top three favorites. 1.) Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes 2.) Juan's Breakfast tacos with bacon added 3.) Bella! Bella! Benny! Honorable mention: Fresh Apple Juice   I always try to get there before 8am, otherwise there is a wait."}
{"text":"Yummy food! Lots of options. Love their Mimosas and wide range juice selections.   Kind of difficult to get into on the weekends, but it's very clear why. It's so good!"}
{"text":"I went to snooze on Sunday for brunch it was incredibly busy we waited for over an hour they don't take reservations and they sat a party of 8 at a round booth table which was pretty tight. This was our only cons. The food was amazing our server was FANTASTIC!!! We had a lovely meal and family time spent well it has a good vibe to it all (: it's definitely one of my favorite spots to go to bad it's not open later then 2pm . Go here you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I've lived in Phoenix for over a year and I can't believe it took me this long to go to Snooze! I've heard a lot about this place and after going here for the first time, I understand exactly why it's so popular and why it has such a high rating on Yelp.   I came here at noon on a Saturday and it was move-in weekend for ASU, so it was pretty packed. Regardless, I was able to get a table in about ten minutes, so I didn't have to wait very long at all. Score!  The service was pretty good. My waitress was attentive and friendly, so nothing bad there.   What I especially love about this place is the variety of sweet and savory. Going into a breakfast spot is really difficult for me because I never know what to get and this place had it all! They also had about five or six different types of eggs Benedict, which I feel like is unheard of! I went with the Bella Bella Benny and it was DELICIOUS! Their hashbrowns are seriously so good too. The iced hazelnut latte really hit the spot too, plus they offer dairy substitutes (soy or almond milk).   All in all this place is fantastic. The Camelback location is more convenient for me but I'd happy return to the Tempe location! If you do, be prepared to pay for parking in either a garage or using a meter. As far as I know, Snooze doesn't validate parking."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Favorite thing to eat would have to be the chorizo or bacon breakfast tacos! The staff seemed real friendly, I would definitely go back to eat there many times. I would also suggest anyone that wants to sit down and have a quality breakfast to too. The eatery is also near a popular bar and grocery shopping centers."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service however is slow and some of the waiters are rude. Also, if you're allergic to bees, don't come. There's bees crawling and flying around everywhere. I brought this up to the manager Miriam and she made up for it all; she deserves a raise."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem while in Denver and was soon ecstatic when I found out it was right here in phx! ( my favorite jeans....not so ecstatic). The sweet potato pancakes, as crazy as that sounds, are amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Food, great drinks, great staff.  I have yet to have the same thing twice and everything has been delicious.  Favorite is the breakfast pot pie."}
{"text":"This place is on point!!! So tasty! Great menu with all the basics covered and some really great creative options as well. Lots of organic and fresh options. Coffee was delicious as well as organic and ethically sourced. Service today was provided by Jeff and he was great. In general all the servers and staff seemed to be friendly and working hard. I can't say enough good things about this place. Realized they have a location close to my home in Tustin, CA. Can't wait to hit up that location."}
{"text":"First the Bangkok Bloody Mary is one of the best we've had - rivaling Screen Door (Portland) and Hash House a Go-Go (San Diego). Loved the ability to pick two Hollandaise dishes from the menu and chose the meat/Mexican one and the Benny Goodman (lox). Both were excellent, as was the toast, sausage and coffee - no mean feat. A new favorite in Phoenix - in the top few with Farmhouse in Gilbert and Matt's in Phoenix. Wait staff was very friendly - lots of people came over and so it was fun, but wondering if it's really efficient? One point off because the free coffee only comes with plastic cups that were recently washed and frankly looked unappetizing. Paper would be much more sanitary. Nonetheless we'll be back."}
{"text":"Verde Bloody Mary and the Havana Benny is my perfect breakfast. If you want to try two different Benny's, you can split an order of two Bennys. The pancakes are great, especially the cinnamon bun pancake. A few other good ones were the Samoa (like the girl scout cookie) and the pineapple upside down pancake.   Service is extremely friendly and great, but its EXTREMELY SLOW. Everytime I've gone we always get bloody mary's and mimosa's and it takes FOREVER. Then the food takes even longer to get, but you know what?? Its worth the wait. Expect to be waiting for a table too, each time I've gone its been about 45 min."}
{"text":"The food here is extraordinary.  I had the chilaquiles benedict and they were swoon worthy.    I did not give it 5 stars because the noise level in the restaurant is painful.  I have slight hearing loss (as do many of us) and the ambient noise is magnified and conversation is impossible.  If noise is not an issue for you, I am sure you will give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I came here while visiting AZ for my friends birthday and we LOVED it! Our waiter CamDog was extremely helpful and made some awesome recommendations. The drinks were good and so was the food! The burritos was huge and full of amazing fresh ingredients. I don't think you can go wrong at this rest"}
{"text":"The coffee was fantastic. Service was fast and very friendly. I sat at the bar and the waitress greeted me with s nice hello and asked how I was doing. Corn beef  hash was amazing. Highly recommend this place when in the Phoenix area. Ill be back for sure"}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast.  The menu has many great options that are a bit different than standard breakfast fare.  Coffee is excellent.  Be prepared for waits up to an hour on weekends."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times and have gotten a few different things. Every time that I've been here I've always done take out just because the wait time is always super long and don't really have patience to wait that long, especially in the morning when I'm hungry. The Sandwich I am is probably my favorite thing on the menu! There's a sauce that comes with the sandwich and they've forgotten it a few times which is quite annoying and I've always noticed it was missing when I arrived home. The customer service is pretty good. The menu prices are a little high though for me. I think I'd definitely give another star if the prices were lower!"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating brunch at Snooze, and I got to say... it was great! The pancakes are very good. Since it was my first time, the waiter sent out a free pancake, to taste. The sweet potato pancakes are awesome paired with a spicy Bloody Mary. The service is great and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We ordered and waited for our food and after two different tables were seated, placed their orders, received their food, paid and left and we still did not have our food yet. Although when it finally arrived it was really worth the wait! The name Omg French toast is very fitting as my boyfriend said \"oh my god\" after the first bite. The Bella Bella Benny was superb and the apple juice AMAZING. I was going to give this 4 stars because the wait, but before we left our server brought us a complementary hot chocolate for being so patient and that small gesture really turned by review around!"}
{"text":"Snooze is always consistent with their food and service. We came here before heading to the airport to leave AZ. We had snooze in Pheonix the day before and really enjoyed our experience there. We had to wait 45 mins for a table at this one. Something I like about Snooze is that their timelines are accurate for a wait. They also text you when your table is about to be ready. This location of this one is pretty small and it's right on campus. We made the mistake of saying first available and it was a hot day. They strategized well with with umbrellas and each table was under an umbrella. The still air didn't help the situation though and we were pretty hot while we ate. It really just took from our experience a bit since the food and service were still great. I had the lower east sider (I'm not sure if it's lower or upper) and it was great. My husband had the build your own omelette which he really enjoyed (again). We both shared the cinnamon roll pancake which is thee best pancake ever! It melts in your mouth and has some sort of warm frosting filling. Oh man, it's divine.  So yeah good food, service, ambiance and I recommend sitting inside!"}
{"text":"Snooze is the best place to go for a delicious breakfast with healthy options. The vibe is fun and this particular location was the nicest snooze I've been to. They had the windows open all around the restaurant which was perfect the morning we visited.  We arrived and were told we'd have to wait 20minutes. We asked to wait at the bar so we could rehydrate after a late evening exploring the Pheonix night life. The hostesses were kind and said we could hang out on the side without a problem. Our service at the bar was excellent too. Each server came over to us to ensure that we had ordered. I got the sweet and spicy chai teas blended together after a recommendation from our server. It was delicious and helped hold me over until my meal. My husband got some tea and was happy that it was loose leaf.   We were sat 20 minutes later and ordered. I had my go-to, the upper east sider which is spinach, artesian bread, smoked salmon, goat cheese with herbs and capers with sun dried tomatoes. It was delicious. My husband got a build your own omelette with green chillies on top. His was also really tasty and he was very happy with his selection. We did share the peanut butter and chocolate chip pancake which we didn't really care for. The cinnamon bun one is what we usually go with and regretted not getting it this time. Fortunately we had another chance the next morning to make up for it. Great spot and great service are always consistent here!"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow because they are busy but the food was excellent! We ordered the breakfast pot pie thingy.... it was lighter than expected but just as satisfying!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food is delicious, staff is super friendly and helpful, pancakes are phenomenal, so glad this place is here in AZ!"}
{"text":"So snoozey and absolutely to die for pancakes. German chocolate, pumpkin, and sweet potato.... served with amazing coffee. The atmosphere is a mid century modern meets dinner. The deduction was due to a little glitch in service. We didn't get our sides until well into the main dishes and coffee was hard to get a refill.Unfortunately the projected 10-15 minute wait was more like 40 minutes. I really liked this place for its fun and food (drink menu looked amazing too, I just don't drink in the daytime). Hopefully today's service was just a glitch."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday breakfast. Had the 3 egg omelette which was amazing. The gf had the Peach Pie pankcakes, which were huge but she very much enjoyed them. Definitely coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place is the best!  They have a great selection of various spins of classic breakfasts.  There are so many pancakes here, I would recommend the pancake flight so you can try a few.  Make sure to ask about the off menu pancakes, including the cinnamon roll pancake.  They have some healthy options also, but this is a place to splurge.  Only thing missing is waffles.  Very popular and trendy, so there may be a wait even on week days, but it's not to bad.  You can never go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Our family has been to Snooze a couple of times and the food is delicious. Our favorite is the cinnamon roll pancake - even though we may order different things we always order the pancake.  We like to try different things on the menu and so far everything has been 5 stars.  The eggs Benedict are wonderful, the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup tastes like heaven and for the kiddos they love the hot chocolate with whipped cream.  I do suggest arriving around 1:00 on Sundays to let the crowd simmer down - we waited an hour last time we were there but it was definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went for my husbands birthday on a Saturday morning. 45 minute wait but we got seats at the bar right away! Food was delicious and service was great. Even got a free pancake for his birthday :) I ordered the two Spanish benedicts and my husband ordered the original. Both delish."}
{"text":"Love this place! My go to is the breakfast tacos and the cinnamon roll pancake (not listed on their menu). I don't think you can really go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here after finding it on Yelp....we had previously eaten at the one in Gilbert and remembered how good the food was. This location is great....the food was even better than we remembered and the staff and Manager Kirsten were awesome. Highly recommended eating here."}
{"text":"The food, although tasty, was lukewarm. I requested my daughter's pancakes with chocolate chips and nothing else on them. They came out smothered in powdered sugar. I would have sent everything back but between the wait to be seated and the time it took to get the food out, we were pretty hungry. I finished my coffee halfway through my meal and never was given a refill. Same with my daughter's juice. It's brand new and hyped up, so obviously it's very busy and loud, so it just isn't a very pleasing atmosphere. Despite being so busy the servers don't seem to move with much urgency. I was pretty disappointed because I keep hearing how amazing it is. Again, the food did taste very good, but it wasn't a good experience overall. I'll probably give it another chance after the hype dies down."}
{"text":"reliably fresh, reliably friendly, reliably not boring food. thank you!"}
{"text":"Ok - I have read other reviews and YES the food was good but heck after 45 mins waiting for a table and then another 45 minutes at the table waiting for food... well our taste buds were diminished, maybe it was the dry mouth we suffered waiting endlessly for refills, or the lack luster wait staff, common one girl was in short shorts that should never be on someone her size (puked in my mouth).  Its the kind of place people go to just because they went in Cali or CO.  If you have no place to be and want to wait hours for OK breakfast then this is the place for you!  Breakfast Club in Old Town has the same wait but your in and out in 20 mins once you sit down... and must better looking staff!"}
{"text":"Awesome fun-filled food place. And great tasting food. I like the ping-ping table. Something to keep us entertained while we wait for our table."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last week..don't judge me! First time around I was so impressed that I brought my boyfriend back with me so he could experience it as well. The Bella Bella Benedict is to die for and you have to get a side of bacon cause it's so good. I also got a Reese's pancake and Blueberry pancake. DELICIOUS and generous sizes! Order your eggs poached and you won't be disappointed. Corned beef hash is also very yummy! Service is great and I love how laid back they seem to be. Will be back next weekend for more!"}
{"text":"Great location. Great coffee. A dog friendly patio. Kids meals. A selection of pancakes that might as well be desserts. Friendly hostesses and servers, for the most part. Cute surroundings. So what's not to like?   Noise this day made conversation a bit difficult, but that's me being a nitpicky Yelp reviewer, the kind I try not to be. I suppose the wait often required to get a table can be a more significant issue. There really is no off peak time at Snooze on the weekends. We usually opt for a very early or very late strategy, but this Saturday we showed up forty-five minutes before closing and still had a five minute wait just to put in our name and had another fifteen minute wait to be seated. There's really no easy solution for the unpredictable waits unless you have a flexible weekday schedule. Given the multitude of great breakfast spots in Phoenix, traditional and otherwise, you have to ask yourself if the food and ambiance at Snooze really is distinctive enough to be worth the hassle. For me? Usually not.   But every once in a while the \"Flight\" three pancake assortment calls my name. This day our table shared a total of six different pancakes, a fun dining experience I'd recommend if you're comfortable sharing."}
{"text":"Cute cafe just off ASU campus. Great breakfast brunch selection."}
{"text":"Brunch brunch brunchhhhhhhhhh.  Came here with my family that's from cali. 11 people!!! 35 minute wait. Ahhh... and 45 minutes for our food to come out.  My uncle was fighting with our waiter, idk the whole story, but we got a gift card and $15 off. :)  Cute layout, great atmosphere. I like the round booth chairs.  Idk if they're snowflakes or jacks around the place. :))   Snooze breakfast burrito ;; vegetarian btw :))) yummmyyyyyy, the sauce was phenomenal. Highly recommended  Three pancake flights ; any choice you want. My nephew got the carrot cake, chocolate and blueberries pancake. He loved it.  French toast neat ;; it was okay. Kinda sweet for me.     OMG French toast ;; omggggggg"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for brunch while we were in town for a music festival during Halloween weekend. The place came highly recommended, and being such a foodie, I had to check it out. We came in a little later (around 1) after their rush and were seated right away at the community table. The staff was all dressed up in costumes being that it was Halloween which was cute (the bartenders were all characters from Orange is the New Black which I thought was pretty awesome.. it is a major college town after all.) After a long night, the first thing we went to was the cocktails. They had multiple Bloody Mary options which is always a great first impression for us! We tried the Gazpacho (lighter and refreshing spin on a bloody with cucumber) it was good, but the best one has to be the Bangkok! It has fish sauce, cilantro, lime, basil, sriracha, and a spicy, salty rim -- AMAZING! Arguably one of the best bloody's I've ever had and that's really saying something. Onto the food... everything sounded amazing, but we both decided on some benny's (there are a ton of them on the menu and they have an option of a \"duo\" benny which is nice because you can do one of each.) I ordered the duo of the \"benny goodman\" and the \"bella! bella!\" because I couldn't decide, but unfortunately when the food came they were both the goodman, but I didn't complain because 1) I work in the industry and know that's annoying (although they did mess up my order.. I hate to waste food and I know if it's sent back it's thrown out) and 2) it was delicious! I would have liked to try the other one, too, but if that's the worst thing that happened at this place I can live with it. The goodman is like a lox bagel style eggs benedict and it was to die for! My boyfriend got the chilaquiles benedict and really enjoyed that, too, (but he said mine was better). Service was good, but not memorable. Maybe it is different if you are at a table instead of the community, but either way it didn't take away or add anything to the experience. The menu was so great that I want to come back and try everything on it! The best news was when I realized they have a location where I live! New regular brunch spot for sure!  Definitely check it out! And you have to try the Bangkok Bloody Mary and the Benny Goodman. So so good!"}
{"text":"Snooze has such a great ambience and the service was amazing! Definitely try the breakfast burrito with green chile sauce, it was absolutely delicious. Will get again."}
{"text":"Great, and our server, Phil was a real pro! Fabulous food, great environment, one of the best Bloody Mary's I've ever had! Can't hardly wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. I get the gluten friendly pancakes and they are amazing. Their hash browns and eggs are to die for. Top that off with great service makes for a wonderful experience. We drive all the way from Goodyear to come here and are never let down."}
{"text":"We arrived at Snooze for what would be our final meal here AZ before heading back home. My sister claims this is her favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix--which is a huge recommendation considering every breakfast here has been terrific. As I perused the menu I noticed they had a nice selection of fancy pancakes and they all sounded terrific. My Brother-in-law pointed out that they had a thing called the \"Pancake Flight\" where you can choose any three flavors you want.  Pancake Flight:  Pineapple Upside Down Pancake- I had to get this since it was one of the Yelp Review Highlights, and it was pretty good but didn't live up to the hype. I actually would've appreciated more Pineapple in it. While it was good, I doubt I'd order it again. 3*  Molten Chocolate Lava Pancake- This was a little slice of Heaven; it's a chocolate buttermilk pancake with a huge dollop of chocolate custard in the middle and topped with a Tangerine Glaze. Oh, yeah.. it's as good as it sounds. 4.5*  Pancake of the Day- Snooze features a different Pancake everyday, so be sure to ask your server before making any final decisions. On the day I was there it was some kind of Salted Caramel/Cinnamon concoction with a dollop of Ancho-Chocolate Custard in the middle. My jaw dropped as our waitress described it--much as yours did as you read my description. It was superb, and if you're lucky enough to be there when they feature it you *must* get it. 5*  Chocolate-Peanut Butter- My wife ordered this as a side to her eggs, and it was so massive I had to help her finish it--one of the perks when you're married to a light eater! It was pretty good, and tasted a lot like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. I'm not a huge Reese's fan, but if you are then this should be right up your alley! 3.5*  Coffee- Above-standard Diner Coffee, but nothing special. They have a whole placard on your table ballyhooing their coffee, but I just didn't get it. 3.5*  Service & Ambiance- Our server was excellent, and I wish I could remember her name and give her credit, but I misplaced the receipt as well. She was a tall, pretty brunette--you can't miss her. Snooze is a very clean and modern-looking, but I found some of their decorations to be a bit cloying--especially that huge asterisk logo thingy. The place also gets very loud, which I don't particularly want first thing in the morning. Time to invest in some sound dampeners, me thinks. 4.5*-service/2.5*-Ambiance  Value- Standard AZ value of less than $10 for breakfast, but still cheaper than Cali pricing. 4*  Everyone really enjoyed their breakfast here at Snooze; I was tempted to give it a 5th star, but the noise factor was a bit of a turn-off. I'd still probably say it's a solid 4.5-star breakfast joint, and I'd definitely go again and again if I lived in the area; I'll just try to remember to bring some earplugs next time."}
{"text":"Go here!! If you haven't been, you're missing out. I wanted to lick my plate. I had the three pancakes and let me tell you...compliments to whoever created the menu...whew...I want some right now just thinking about it. Ok so I had the pineapple upside down pancake, the sweet potato and the blueberry streusel...yall...so damn tasty. Mimosas and other cocktails, great service, outside seating. I have nothing bad to say. I think we'll go there for breakfast tomorrow."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. Had the green chili Benny and the pancake flight. Pineapple upside down pancakes are unreal. Beau is an amazing server and this is a fantastic location. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday and it was pretty darned good. The dining room was pretty much full when i arrived, it looked like it might be slowing down as i was getting ready to leave, about 1130ish. The server amy was very friendly and knowledgable. She answered all the questions my friend and I threw her way. I ordered the fall harvest benedict while my friend had the huevos rancheros. Both items were tasty and hot! As for drinks, we stuck with coffees and water even though there are recommendations on here to check out the alcoholic drinks, just figured it might be a smidge too early to be drinking on a tuesday. We were checked on just the right amount of times by the serving staff, not too little but not too many where you feel bothered. The wait staff here seems to truly like what they do, countless smiles thoughout our meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Snooze in Denver. And it was great! I was somewhat disappointed in Snooze in Scottsdale.   I got there slightly after they opened. Server had no idea what the pancake of the day was. I ordered the flight of pancakes and they were good to really good.   I also ordered iced coffee.- Watered down hot coffee. I requested a second glasses of it--it was good. It took a while too get it, place was not busy at all.. Each glass was $2.50. For $5 for coffee, I want actual iced coffee, not watered down and I want it expeditiously. Yeah, over $2.50, I get the right to be a bitch.    I'll go back. I won't order coffee. I'm cheap and thirsty. I'll order something other than pancakes.  They're good, bit not so sure worth the calories."}
{"text":"Finally made it here for brunch! No wait at all. So many options on the menu but we have settled on the breakfast pot pie and the snooze special. We also ordered a extra side of chocolate chip pancake which is the bomb!!! Sooooo good! Love the atmosphere; great service. We'll come back soon!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried is super delish. It's a bit pricey, but worth it. Plan to wait in line for a table, even during odd hours."}
{"text":"Very good quality food and very delicious. Very friendly service, will come again. I like that they take your cell phone number down instead of a pager. This gives me a chance to walk around while I wait."}
{"text":"Wooooooow! Must stop for breakfast!!! It can get really busy so try to come early!   Harvest Benny - out of this world! I am in love. So unique with the poached eggs sitting ontop of these cheesy quinoa cakes. I loved it.   Gluten free chocolate chip pancakes - 10/10!  Fluffy and tasty!! So grateful for gluten free options!   Also their home fries are soooooo good."}
{"text":"Best food,  service,  music and location. Highly recommended. So delicious and sitting outside on a Saturday morning was fantastic."}
{"text":"High energy hipster breakfast place with cool decor and REALLY LOUD music. Pancakes are tasty but if you want syrup, you have to ask for it--they don't just give it to you. The bacon tasted strangely mild and a bit off. There's space outside for kids to play games or run around so it's definitely family friendly. The place is really popular, so you can wait a long time for both a table and your meal after you've ordered. I really hate music so loud I have to yell to have a conversation with my brunch partner, so I'll probably give the place a miss in the future and leave it to the many patrons who clearly love it."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.  Things I liked: Decor Retro atmosphere Cool round tables with nice seating Scrambled eggs  Things that did not impress me: The pancakes.  Now granted, I ordered just plain pancakes, but I have had some amazing plain pancakes in my time, and these were not.  Flat and overcooked.  The flavor was pretty good, but they were not fluffy buttermilk, yummy pancakes.  I know they have all the fancy options with a bunch of toppings, but if you can't get the plain ones to be outstanding, then you are not winning me over.  The hash brown cake.  It looked adorable, but I did not care for it.  I like my ratio of fried to not fried a little higher.  Soft in the the middle, not crispy.  Did not care for the flavor/seasoning on them either.  Just not my thing.  They did a nice job with customer service.  It was extremely busy and loud, but I expected that based on other reviews.  It's a cute place, but I think I will try other breakfast options that can make more impressive plain pancakes."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this weekend and I will definitely be back!   Very cute and open decor with a large friendly staff.  There was a little bit of a wait when we arrived but it was worth it!   From there signature drinks to take on brunch, I think this place is definitely sticking around.  I had just an original mimosa w/oj but they offer many other juices to mix.  For my entree, I opted for the Snooze Spuds Deluxe: A heaping portion of our hash browns, covered with melted cheddar & jack cheese, scallions plus two veggies , meats, or combo of your choice. (taken directly from their menu) So good and our service was fantastic.   I would eat here every morning if I could!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. The food is good but not worth the,[hour] wait.   Maybe once the \"new\" wears off the wait will be less.  They also need to reevaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of their seating and dining area.  There is definitely opportunity to maximize and utilize the space better. Severally tables that could accommodate 4 or more were filled with pairs/couples. While these particular table-booth hybrids look cool, they are inefficient in terms of seating management. They do offer coffee for those waiting outside. [As you enter the door turn right. It is against the back wall to the right if the bar/counter.] Unfortunately we discovered this after a trip to Dunkin Donuts for some coffee to tide us over.   Upon checking in they enter your phone number and text you when your table it's ready. Which is 'good' because with an \"45-60 minute wait\" you have time to check out neighboring stored in Town & Country Center.  In hind sight we should have gone across the street to Daily Dose Midtown.   The food:  There were 3 of us. One had the traditional eggs Benedict ( to their credit they have several varieties of benedicts to choose); one had the Potato pile up ( or something like that) and added 2 eggs. I ordered the pancake flight (choice of 3 pancakes from their regular or daily menu) pineapple upside down cake, carrot cake and the daily special peanut butter and jelly, with a side of bacon.  Like I mentioned at the get go I have no complaints over the food. The ingredients are quality and prepared well. As an example, the hollandaise was done well and eggs poached well.  I am not a pancake person but the varieties were too tempting. No syrup necessary with the toppings unique to each choice. The pancakes were not  as sweet as I expected, which was a very pleasant surprise.   I can see myself going back eventually. Although I have put this into the same category that I have Matt's Big Breakfast, good but not worth the wait, and will likely try it again in the summer before 10am."}
{"text":"The food was incredible and our waitress was nice, but man, the wait.  It took an hour to get in, which is normal and to be expected for a place like Snooze, but we also had to wait about 40-45 minutes for our food once we placed our order.  No explanation was given and when I asked they said it was coming. There was no apology, so maybe this is normal for Snooze?   Not sure if this is normal or not, but it does make me hesitate to return simply because I don't see myself wanting to spend another 2 1/2 hours at a restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Went here for the first being in that part of town and my wife and children and I loved it! Food was very good and clean too. Our service was first class, our server was Colby and she was amazing and very attentive especially to the kids. Food was good, service was great and will be back next time we are over there!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, open air atmosphere and good service.  The wait time was about 45 minutes but with plenty of places to shop or window shop why not wait.  Tried their coffee (Guatemalan) which was strong but so good.  Shared some pancakes with a friend, the peanut butter pancake was delicious, the chocolate chip was good too but a bit sweet with the chocolate.   Ordered the pot pie breakfast and it was a egg over easy (your choice really) gravy with sausage over a flaky crispy flour bed, tasted like biscuits & gravy to me. Hashbrowns were ok, nothing amazing there.  The staff is good, this morning most waitresses were dressed as Disney Characters which was nice.   They have a bar that serves alcohol as well if you need a nice pick me up."}
{"text":"Where to begin... delicious food and outstanding customer service... I had their huevos rancheros and chocolate pancakes which are out of this world chocolate piece of heaven (trust me if you love chocolate you must get them)"}
{"text":"To be fair, most of my visits to Snooze would result in a 5* but today's visit was very disappointing.  I sat down at the bar to eat around 1:30 and ordered a breakfast burrito.  At 2:15 I asked my server if they had a status on it...  I'm pretty sure it was never ordered but about 5 minutes later a cold burrito came out with the shredded cheese inside not even melted.  I ate about a 1/3 of it and brought the rest home to heat up in my microwave.  For a $12 breakfast burrito I would expect more.  I'm not giving up on Snooze but I was very displeased today."}
{"text":"It's Worth a shot. The food is good but overpriced, im sure the prices are justified though based on the location ... (Their rent must cost a thousand lifetimes of savings per month)   Let's address the kicker. It's not what I would call the most timely experience, but I get it ... breakfast is supposed to be a relaxing 2 hour journey through roasted coffee beans and hash browns .... but ... The reason it's called snooze is because you'll be able to get in a solid snooze in before anyone comes and takes your order.   The food itself along with the menu is diverse and tasty. So no complaints there really other than being over priced. The staff is friendly and upbeat and Im sure part of the wait has to do with the line out the door so I guess that says something positive.  Fry me up some eggs n turkey bacon! Were not going ham on this one (Cause I hate pork) but Snooze is well needed in this location so I bumped you guys up a star ... I can see the quality in ingredients is truly there and the attempt to create a clean green contemporary breakfast selection is fantastic."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for fancy breakfast. We try to get in as early as possible because they get so packed usually with a long line. If we are too hungry, we opt out to eat at Postinos right next door:) I always get egg benedict and my husband gets breakfast burrito. Cute, open atmosphere and yummy food!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Our waitress Lizzie was friendly and informative. Being a vegetarian I'm always looking for new soy and tofu products, and I highly recommend the soyrizo! Even the carnivore in our group said it tasted just like real chorizo. The food was great and the service was quick! The pineapple upside down pancakes were to die for. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Food was so so bland and tasteless. But location is great, inside is great, staff is great. But food sucked. I think this place is more trendy then delicious."}
{"text":"Great breakfast find while on vacation. Corned beef hash was excellent and OMG French toast was as good as advertised. Great environment and service to boot."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is great and customer service is awesome. It is a little bit crowded which sometimes can be frustrating. I highly recommend palo mimosa"}
{"text":"Very good food. The pancakes were ok. Very sweet and heavy. They were good I just prefer them lighter and fluffier. But overall. We will be back."}
{"text":"I wish you could give bonus stars for customer service! Myself and some gal pals from the office placed a to go order and when we got back to work realized we were missing one side taco. I called the manager who offered to drive over the item since our office isn't very far away. Very shortly afterwards he arrived with not one but 3 tacos and 2 different kinds of pancakes. I was blown away! First of all, the food is insanely delicious to begin with but what really caught my attention was how well the manager guaranteed that we'd be back by going above and beyond!"}
{"text":"My review is strictly based on carry out. There's no point of calling your order in ahead of time to have ready when you pick up. Your going to wait there no matter what and if you think your waiting because your food wasn't made yet, your wrong. Placed an order 30 mins before I got there and they made me wait another 20 mins there. Took additional 5 mins to get an extra syrup for the pancakes. Came home to finally enjoy the food and the food is cold! That's why they got my 1 star!"}
{"text":"I have been living in Gilbert for year now and yet I hadn't tried this concept. Now I had finally have that chance to try it myself and I was not disappointed. I decided to order the signature pancakes with the sweet potato, blueberry, and the original. When I have received the cakes, I was amazed by its presentation. They look that they can be displayed at a food museum. Well, after I've received the cakes, I've chowed onto the cakes and it was delicious. The cakes were very soft and the different flavors completely adds personality to them. Enough with the impressive quality of the pancakes, I highly recommend checking this place out if you can beat the rush in the morning. 4 out of 5. P.S the screwdriver was alittle too strong."}
{"text":"Using some sloppy math, I figure I have eaten breakfast out probably over 1500 times. My breakfast at Snooze was easily in the top three or four I have ever had. That's no bull.  First, the setting: very nice, fresh d√©cor and design.  The place was immaculately clean.  I was seated immediately ( I was there very early).   I had a hard time selecting what I wanted...everything on the menu sounded great.  I settled on a scramble with mushrooms, tomatoes and avocado, with a side of bacon and rye toast (it's sad how few places offer rye as a bread choice).   I didn't have to wait long. My plate was delivered in minutes. The eggs were perfect:  fresh, not over or under cooked.  Veggies were integrated perfectly into the eggs.  The bacon...I don't have the words to describe it...best flavored bacon I have ever had, cooked perfectly.  The salsa they provided (I could have red or green, I chose red) was delicious. And get this:  the toast was actually toasted... imagine that (too many restaurants do not get the toast brown enough). I very nice currant jelly came with the toast.   Their coffee was delicious, and my cup was never empty.  They have a full bar, and a bloody mary I saw served was irresistible, so I went for it ...it too was excellent. Their olives rule.   Service was super friendly and appropriately fast ( as in \"let me take care of you\" fast rather than \"hurry up so I can turn the table\" fast).   I was quite surprised at the prices...very reasonable given the quality, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Let's start with how all the eggs are range and cafe free . The meat is all humane killing vegetarian fed.  But wait so much more to say ... They brought my best friends and I a free strawberry pancake just because and it was the most perfectly delicious pancake ever .   I ordered Benedict's . I say Benedict's because u can mix and match ur Benedict's . I got chilaquiles and bela benedicts . Mouth watering perfection.   This place makes me hate Arizona a little less."}
{"text":"I've gone to both the Tempe and Phoenix locations and this place is awesome! I give 4 stars simply because they're always super busy, so you usually have to wait a decent amount of time to sit and to get drinks. But once you order the food, it comes out SO QUICK and is always bangin'."}
{"text":"The food was so good! All five family members loved it.  Everything we had was delicious. The wait was 40 minutes but it was worth it.  Smoked salmon eggs Benedict amazing."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times & the food selection has always been amazing. I've tried a little bit of a variety on the menu & I've always loved the food. The service has always been great too. Depending on the time of the day you come, there may be a wait; however, the food is worth the wait so I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Inspired food. Insipid service. Should our first clue have been the waitress' vapid gaze or the mindless dribble of incoherent gastronomic buzzwords which burst forth like a teenager's acne? Perhaps the disengaged and mechanical affirmations to our queries and comments should have fostered more concern? Alas, I spend such little time in the presence of tweakers, I missed the early warning signs of atrocious service.  Thankfully this lackluster performance was repeated with such regularity at every interaction we came to quickly relish, in the way of a beaten animal, the trials and tribulations our brunch entailed. Our waitress' feat was only topped by the complete disinterest of her supervisor in resolving a minor billing concern. The supervisor did a brilliant job of failing to resolve our concern in any way and avoiding providing clear information to understand the concern. Such rousing leadership at Snooze's head affords the clear inspiration behind our waitress' sterling work ethic.  Our atrocious service was unfortunate for Snooze offers some truly impeccable dishes from unassuming well-seasoned hash-browns to the dare I say foodgasmic OMG French toast. Nevertheless, until such time our robot overlords automate away the humble waitress profession I must recommend forgoing Snooze's culinary delights in favor of any other establishment which values event a modicum of customer service."}
{"text":"It's breakfast.  Snooze turns it into a special meal.  Great menu, great service, great decor, great everything - except the wait.  I have never been to Snooze - weekend or weekday when I didn't have to wait at least 15 minutes - over an hour on weekends.  But I wait cause it's worth it.  I'm not one for the sweet pancakes though they are delicious.  I love the spuds with lots of fillings and a poached egg on top.  The benedict with the lox is killer good.  Go often - try everything!  I'm only giving four stars cause I hate the wait."}
{"text":"I love the food at Snooze. The ingredients are so fresh and delicious. The thing I haven't enjoyed about this Snooze location is the service. The last two times I went there the waitresses have been rude. One time she checked on the table next to us 3-4 times before acknowledging my presence and refilling my water glass. When I asked her to refill it she acted like it was such a bother. I understand that serving drinks other than water get you better tips but that is no reason to ignore me."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Our first time here. We will definitely be back. Our server, Kenslie was so attentive and definitely perfection! We went to the Gilbert location for breakfast for my husband's birthday. She overheard me say happy birthday to the grandchild and next thing you know, out came a birthday pancake! We were looking for the hidden camera because we didn't know how they knew. When Kenslie came back out we asked her how did they know and she said she was nosey and overheard me say happy birthday! That's not nosiness, that's an awesome server!!  Did I mention the food was unbelievable! The grandkids were so happy and raves about how good the food was!!  Thanks Snooze and thanks Kenslie!! You rock girl!!   Tara"}
{"text":"Being a green chile lover, I had the pork chile verde which was incredible.  Personally, I would've loved even more of the green chile, but for Phoenix, it was yummy!  Packed on a Friday morning - does anyone work anymore?"}
{"text":"I love snooze!!! They have great drinks and food! Pancakes and eggs benedicts are amazing !!! Great food and atmosphere !!!! I am a repeat customer for sure !"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the valley! ....and for some reason I can't just say that it is the best one I've had in a long time so I am now just typing so I can submit."}
{"text":"I've tried getting into this Snooze a few times but the trick is to come here super early on the weekends and there won't be a wait. We showed up around 9am and there was a line out the door. My friend is in a wheelchair and it was next to impossible to maneuver her around the crowded tables of people without disrupting their meal. I had the sweet potato pancakes and it was not at all what I was expecting. I decided to try their regular pancakes and they also fell flat.  My friend had the break pot-pie but the eggs seemed way too gooey for my taste. I guess I will pass on Snooze from now on and just go next door."}
{"text":"This fun retro looking restaurant offers the best breakfast food I have even had.  Because everything looked great on the menu, we each ordered different meals to \"taste\" it all.  Hands down, best pancakes ever!! We had  the blueberry danish (my favorite) with a lemon center, cinnamon danish, crazy delicious and chocolate chip.  Eggs and bacon with crispy hash browns delicious.  I don't know how they do the bacon, but it was better than any bacon I have ever eaten.  Someone ordered the corned beef has and eggs and from someone who has tasted corned beef has in many many restaurants, this was the best we ever ate.  Guatemalan coffee was rich and robust.  The staff is super friendly.  Do not miss this one for breakfast, a winner!!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. The wait staff has always been friendly & I haven't had an issue in the dozen or so times I have been here. Juan's Tacos are my go too, the drinks & atmosphere are great. Only issue is the wait but that's to be expected."}
{"text":"Fifteen minutes after being seated and the waiter never showed up. No water...... Nothing....  Might try it again if they fix their server issues."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places we have ever eaten at! The atmosphere was open and fun. The food was amazing and the service was even better! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this breakfast spot you're missing out. Beside you might have to wait before getting in, this place is worth the wait. The staff is attentive and the concept is amazing."}
{"text":"This place was a last minute audible, we show up at 9:30a on a Sunday morning and there's a 30 min wait. I kinda like this as a sign as waiting usually means something worth waiting for. The systems where they use tablets to text us when the table are ready is revolutionary. It allows people to hang out by the fountain and converse. By the time we left at 10:30a it was like an outdoor party broke out in the parking lot. This place is easily the coolest brunch place in the city and it's not just because of the OMG French Toast and the breakfast burrito (both of which were slamming btw). It's got a fun space age decor. The music is peak hour wedding music with the Bee Gees and Michael Jackson. The coffee comes with a story about how it's hand grown in the mountains of Guatemala. Big flat screens. The service is friendly but it's absolutely precise with waiters, runners and bus boys turning tables at record speed. Some might say it's bordering on douchey (and maybe that's a fair comment) but overall a fun experience and delicious food."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 6 times and the first 4 were good and the last 2 were very poor. The servers are in another world. We sat for 15 minutes before we received our drinks and another 15 minutes until they took the order. Food took along time to come out almost cold. The french toast was dry and tasteless. Instead of them focusing on opening more places, they need to get the service fixed and improve the food."}
{"text":"I love this place! Love it. Breakfast at lunch time. Yay! My friends whisked me off without much notice and was so happy with their choice. This is the cutest darn place! Booths galore with round tables down the center aisle. (Best for 4 ppl.)  After ordering a heavenly cappuccino (it really was that good) I studied the menu. With so much to talk about I had a hard time picking a meal. When I spied an entire section with eggs benedict's I focused my energy there. The very kind server helped my indecisiveness by explaining that my order could consist of 1/2 of anything. Phew! I really like eggs so I stayed in the Benny section.   The Bella! Bella! Benny spoke volumes to me with prosciutto, Taleggio cheese, topped with a cream cheese hollandaise on a toasted chiabatta. I had forgotten a balsamic glaze would be sprinkled over the (perfectly gooey egg). Until now I had *no idea* my palate craved a hint of bitterness on an egg. Good stuff!  The Upstream Benny is smoked salmon served on a jalapeno-cream cheese spoonbread. I gotta tell you, I loved the bread! Salmon is something you can't go wrong with. Healthy, and quite delicious, when paired with cucumber and corn salsa.  I meant to fork sample my friend's pineapple pancake. Uh. Well, I ate an ENTIRE half. Sweet bejeebers that was divine.  I've never had anything quite that like that. I can't do justice to explain why. The pancake was super fluffy, the pineapple made it sweet (of course) and the butter made it dance in my mouth. HOH. MY. GAWD.   The service here is impeccable! Mercedes was such a gem. Full of information and oh so patient. (We were talking too much and maybe taking a hair too long to order.) Our coffee and waters were constantly refilled and she was overflowing with genuine happiness.  Hurry in to grab a seat kids! This place is first come first served. Alas, no reservations."}
{"text":"It was a long wait but well worth it. They take your name and number and text you when your table is ready so you can go shop while you waiting. Great food. I had the French toast and hash browns."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is super awesome! and the menu looked unique and intresting . Although when we ordered we were not impressed with our food. I got the chili verde Benedict and my friend spud plate . Mine came with literally two little strands of pork and hers was just a pile Of potatoes with an egg on it. I thought this place would be so much more impressive food wise . Not impressed"}
{"text":"Delicious! Every time I go everyone I'm with just ravs how good their food is. High quality and lots of awesome looking options. I want to try everything on the menu. Usually crowded but absolutely worth the wait. Nicely decorated with good music playing, fun atmosphere. I love the Benny Goodman, one of their Benedict options with smoked salmon. I wish it was closer, I would go all the time if I could."}
{"text":"Do. Not. Come. For. The. Coffee.  Even though there is a special stand-up card on every table speaking sooooo highly about the quality of the restaurant's coffee and it's super special artisanal-ness, it was burnt swill. I drink coffee rarely anymore so when I decide to have a cup I'm very selective. After reading said little stand up card I thought, surely for all this marketing, there must be something to the coffee here. Not so much. It was worse than the burnt roasts at Starbucks. And to be fair - in case the particular pot that poured my cup had sat too long - I requested a new cup from a fresh pot. Same thing. Even the manager that I spoke with after the meal rolled his eyes when I talked about the coffee and basically said it had the quality of gasoline.  But I get ahead of myself. Let's return to the beginning because the coffee is not alone in the mediocrity that was Snooze that day.  When you come during a busy time, expect a wait. That doesn't bother me at all - the bustle of an exciting and popular restaurant and a little wait tells me that many folks are happy to be eating there - and it's usually an indication of great quality food and service. Once a table became available, we did get stuck in a back corner next to a pile of high chairs, the swinging back patio door, and under an air conditioning fan. The only thing that saved me from freezing was the regular opening of the door letting in the warm summer air as servers went in and out. So not the best table and not the best climate control, but all in all that wasn't going to get us down.  The restaurant was slammed. I might also say that during busy hours, Do. Not. Come. For. The. Service. It's so disappointing that we as patrons should need to avoid certain hours of the day because waitstaff whose job it is to know how to wait tables properly during their ENTIRE SHIFT simply cannot manage to hold it together when it's time to MOVE QUICKLY AND SMARTLY.  Our server couldn't manage that. We waited for someone to take our first drink order (that lovely coffee) an unreasonable amount of time. Once she showed up, she was distracted and never once looked us in the eye. Every interaction with her during the visit found her constantly looking ahead to her next task, her next stop - so much so that she seemed to already be gone from the table by the time she got there. And to top it off, she put on the fake sugary patronizing voice that makes it SOUND like she cared about what was being asked for, but her mind was elsewhere. And when we did ask for something - cream, natural sugar - it took an unreasonable amount of time to receive it.  It's unfortunate that now I can't remember much about the food. I think it was fine - maybe even inventive. I might have had a Benedict (?) with an interesting rendition of asparagus (?). I think my husband enjoyed whatever he ate too. I waited too long to write this review for starters, but my memory of the food is eclipsed by the poor service and the supercilious attitude of our server.  But then there was also this.  Two women were seated at about the same time next to us. They ordered pancakes (JUST PANCAKES) and REQUESTED the pancakes be cooked well in the middle. This order was taken right around the time of our coffee order. Their pancakes arrived right around the time our food order was taken. The pancakes were RUNNY in the middle. They sent them back.  The server that was working with them didn't apologize, didn't assure them that it would be made right, didn't demonstrate care one way or the other that the kitchen messed up or that she put crap food down for two people she's supposed to be caring for. Her attitude was rather that she was terribly inconvenienced by the whole thing and it now threw a wrench into her works.  Our food came. We ate - leisurely and talking. Out of the corner of my eye I watched the table next to us. They sat. And waited. We ate. And talked. They waited some more. No one came to tell them it would \"be just a few more minutes and we're so sorry for the mix up\". At one point someone came and delivered a side of bacon. OF BACON! They had the balls to slap down a side and run away when the main course wasn't even present. Poor, poor, POOR SERVICE.  We finally finished our meal. The pancakes finally showed up. It had to have been 20-30 minutes later. For pancakes, people. Pancakes. A 6-10 minute dish and you couldn't be bothered to get it together and treat these women well.  Pitiful.  We paid. And after stopping to express my apologies to the women for how they were treated at Snooze, I went straight to the manager to tell him just how piss-poor their service was. (And how the coffee was burnt swill.) To his credit, he said he would make it right immediately and he was confident the ladies would be happy by the time they left. I really hope that meant comping their entire bill.  Do better, Snooze. You're not \"all that\"."}
{"text":"Absolutely worth visiting for a great breakfast! Wish we had these in South Carolina. Love the interior decor,  the friendly service by all, and the breakfast food was delicious. We sat at a bar table facing the window, here you could see out front all the people moving about the area. We were instantly greeted by our server Spinsa, and she quickly returned with large mugs of coffee.  The menu appropriately features all you could want for breakfast, we both decided on eggs benedict specials. Plus, we saw their pancakes and had to split an order between us.  This place has it going on, and it is worth it. There was always a wait to be seated, but most were seated in a good time.  Great coffee, delicious breakfast, efficient and friendly service. We will return."}
{"text":"We really enjoy Snooze because it's close to home and has a dog friendly patio.  The food is always consistently good, and the wait staff are quick and attentive.  There is always a wait here but they have a nice texting system that allows you to look around at other shops in the complex while waiting for your table.  5 stars for the texting system... other breakfast joints (Looking at you Matt's Big B) should follow suit on this!!"}
{"text":"We tried this out a couple days ago after hearing mixed reviews. The food was pretty good, but our server, Tiffany, is really what made the experience excellent! She was very friendly and was very patient, as it was our first time here. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far with my boyfriend. Whenever we have time to get breakfast we always end up wanting to go here. It's by asu campus so I usually go to breakfast after class and he'll meet me there. The first time coming here was on a Sunday. Bleh! It was super busy and the experience wasn't as great as I had that next Tuesday. I think it was just because it was so crowded. The great thing about this place is that they text you the link of their app. The app shows up exactly how many \"parties\" are ahead of you and what the estimated time of wait is. It's amazing! I wish more restaurants did this. Anyway, the second visit I got the Benny's. THEY LET YOU COMBINE BENNYS ON ONE PLATE! genius. I got the Bella Bella Benny and Benny goodman. The BENNYS also come with hash browns (you can ask them to make them crispy!!) Yum!! The coffee is also surprisingly light and amazing. I liked the regular coffee better than a mocha latte, which is saying something. I'll keep coming back but preferably during the week. Service is also EXCEPTIONAL. They are attentive and customer oriented. On the patio, they made sure the sun wasn't in my eyes. If you're also not satisfied with the food, they'll go above and beyond to make sure you had a positive experience."}
{"text":"Went a couple weeks ago. Told we would have to wait 30 mins for a table out back-- no problem. However, when we got out onto the back patio, the sun was blazing down and the misters were not on.. I asked our waitress if they planned to turn them on and she said they're not hooked up? What's the point? Food was good as expected with snooze, but our waitress' attitude was subpar."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast restaurant. It makes places like \"The Good Egg\" and \"The Eggery\" seem like fast food joints. I recommend trying it during the week because I hear it's near impossible to get in there on weekends.  The hostess was friendly. The waiter was fantastic. The food was incredible. I had Juan's Breakfast tacos with chicken sausage. When the food was presented, it looked like a 5-star chef's work - visually very pleasing - and it tasted even better. Our service was great - our waters, teas and coffees never seemed to get less than half full before refills were on the way.  I've lived in Phoenix most of my life, and this is by far the best find for a great breakfast experience."}
{"text":"This was a tasty fun place. Went on a Saturday and was busy with a 20 minute wait. Lots of upbeat music. The servers were friendly and helpful with the Gluten free info. I had an omelet and GF order of upside down pineapple pancakes and hash browns. Was very good. Unfortunately my wife and I both had to hit the bathroom within a half hour after eating there. She has no gluten issues but I do. IDK, maybe related maybe not."}
{"text":"It took a while to be seated, which I understand, however, once I was seated, I could hardly get my waitress to come to my table, everything I got was warm my water, my apple juice, a mimosa I had to constantly ask for a cup of ice for everything, and didn't receive it. I went by recommendation of food and got the corn beef hash I ask for over easy eggs in got hard fried I personally didn't like the recommended food but my friends food was great"}
{"text":"If you love breakfast food, Snooze is the place for you. Familiar with their restaurants, I first visited one of the Snooze eateries in San Diego.  When I found out there was one in Tempe, I told my friends that we had to eat there while we were in town on a work trip.  Three of us showed up around 7:30am on a Sunday and there was no wait at all, but I didn't expect there to be that early which is why we showed up when we did.  From past experiences at the other Snooze I'd been to, I knew the place would be packed before too long, especially on a Sunday.  I knew I wanted a pancake flight for the variety. You can order any 3 flavors available for $9.75. I chose the Bourbon Street Pumpkin, Blueberry Danish, and Chocolate Chip. The guys both got the Breakfast Pot Pie with rosemary sausage gravy, puff pastry, egg, and hash browns.  After getting a taste of this, I wish I'd ordered it, too, because it was amazing!  Not that I was disappointed with my pancakes at all.  I especially liked the Blueberry Danish one. My tip for Snooze is get there early or expect a wait and share your meal with your loved ones so you can try more good eats."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this morning with my daughter and her boyfriend food was great service was awesome. The only problem I had was making a selection off of the menu it all looked so good. Definitely my new favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"I'll start out by saying that the manager was very nice and comped our breakfast. The bad news is that we sent the toast back 3 times it was either warm bread or burnt. Eggs over medium were eggs over hard and bacon was cold and like jerky. This experience is unusual. Normally the food is very good. I'm hoping it's just a new cook or different process."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Delicious food. Good service. I had the Green Eggs n Hammie, would definitely recommend it. My wife's yogurt parfait and grapefruit creme br√ªl√©e looked equally delicious. They also have a really cool outside patio area with games. Would come again.  The only downside is it's a tad on the expensive side for us. Other than that, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"So delicious! I always go to a Snooze when there is one in the row I'm staying at. Loved the pancake flight!"}
{"text":"If you like pancakes for breakfast then this is the place you've been looking for. So many different flavors. It's hard to decide which one to get.  Delicious"}
{"text":"Amazing food and our waiter Charles was the best! The place was packed however he never let it get tob him! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Currently sitting outside on my \"twenty minute\" wait that turned into well over an hour. Hope the food is really Good!"}
{"text":"Really nice place to go to. The food here is exceptional. I tried the pancake of the day which was the butter melt with white chocolate chips and another flavor with it. The mocha was good as well. The place looks really clean and has a interesting character to it."}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times. The first time I didn't have the greatest experience.  My friend's food came out first and 10 minutes later mine came out. We just had water for drinks but it was only refilled once (which was right when he brought our check). I had the Huevos Rancheros, nothing too special about it.   I was also just here today. Much better experience. My server (who also had someone training with her) did an EXCELLENT job. She was prompt with refills of coffee and water. I had the B.E.A.T. Sandwich with avocado and my husband had 3 scrambled eggs with churizo and onions. Service wise, I'd give this a 5-star rating.   Overall, the food was fine, nothing to rave about, which is why I gave this a 3-star rating. It's a very busy place and so expect a little bit of a wait. I'd say give this place a try to see for yourself if you like it or not."}
{"text":"Not sure this place is worth the wait - 50-80 minutes on the weekend when we went, but it was good.  The adult beverages we tried were good- I had the Manhattan one.  The pancake of the day was chocolate and coconut, but wasn't as flavorful as I thought.  This place does have the best bacon I have ever had by far.  It was not under or over cooked.  Very tender yet slightly crispy... I really don't know how they cooked it so perfect,  but it was literally perfect.  Prices weren't a bargain, but service was good. Tip: put in your name and head over to Twin Peaks for an app while you wait."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday morning and (as expected) was very busy. Since our wait was long the restaurant gave us some delicious spicy chai teas on the house! The Snooze Breakfast Burrito was more than enough food - with a green chile sauce that had spectacular flavor. Great atmosphere for a breakfast/brunch in Tempe!"}
{"text":"This new breakfast restaurant from Colorado is awe...some... I was super impressed, and the husband was too. I almost don't want to tell anyone because I don't want to have to wait for hours to eat here (ha.). So, to start, the restaurant is decorated cutely, definitely not reminiscent of the souper salad or whatever that was there before. We sat down and read the story of their coffee...I guess the owner went to Guatemala and personally picked out the coffee they use....pretty cool stuff, also was tasty. Then our waitress came by to see if we were ready, I told her I was between two things, and she said, oh well that's great because we order half and half anything for the same price....I was flabbergasted. What?!?! Yup. You can get half pancakes half tacos or two different types of benedict or half french toast half benedict or whatever.....that is the coolest thing ever!!!! I love variety, so this kinda rocked my socks. I ended up ordering half harvest bene and half chilaquiles bene. The husband got the pineapple upside down pancakes (PS you can get flights of pancakes...3 different types....ahhhh!). The harvest bene was good, had a goat cheese polenta cake, leeks, other fresh veg...with a perfectly poached egg and hollandaise. As good as that was, the chilaquiles was Ah mazing! Delicious roasted beef barbacoa, spicy tomato pico, another perfectly poached egg and a cheddar hollandaise....it was heaven on a plate. Even the potatoes were good (and I'm not a huge breakfast potato fan). The husband loved his pineapple pancakes....he said they were the best pancakes he's had in town...to quote him 'these pancakes were better than any I had on any Hawaiian island.' I will definitely be back and if it's consistently this good, it will be a five star for sure."}
{"text":"We give them a 5 for vibe, entertainment, service, friendliness and food quality!!! Amazing place!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened one in Tempe!  Came here for brunch and everything was perfect. The weather was nice, we got a seat on their lovely patio..   I ordered the 3 eggs omelette. Onions, ham and mushrooms for me. I should've put some sort of their sauce on it. However, it was delicious either way. I can't believe they have a caramel apple mimosa! Um what!? It was sweet and delicious and tasted like a caramel apple.   Everything was great, and the service was good. It took about 30 minutes for us to get a table though, and they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"I've been to the Snooze in Tempe so this was my first time to the Gilbert location.   There are so many good things on their menu. I ordered the Bella Bella Benny. I loved everything about this. The hollandaise with prosciutto and cream cheese. Even the hash browns that it came with was really good. I also ordered the English garden mimosa that was delicious.   I love that they have so many good items on their menu and so many great choices for Mimosas! On the downside though, the wait is always so long and they don't take reservations. They have a cute outdoor patio in the back and it is also dog friendly. Great place for brunch. However, for the amount of time you have to wait for a table they really need to take reservations or get on the No Wait app."}
{"text":"Love the ambience here. Had the Benny Duo and decided on the Bella! Bella! Benny and the Benny Goodman, which were both delicious. A little on the warm side I thought; maybe wanted to be a little warmer, but tasty nevertheless!  I can't visit a breakfast spot without trying a pancake of theirs. I did the blueberry danish joint and it was a little overwhelming at first site, but not too crazy on the palate. Sweet, too! (Unless you don't like sweet and then I'd say go for something else.)  I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"Just wow! I had the best breakfast today thanks to this place. First, my mimosa was out of this world, then I ordered the burrito which was also super good. We ordered a ton of food when we came here. The wait is a bit long, but have no fear. There is an amazing outlet store called last chance across the store and you could get so many great deals. Back to the restaurant, the waiter and waitress were amazing and super friendly."}
{"text":"Went here for the second time today. Not as great as the first experience I got the Ruben sandwich definitely not something I would order again. My hash browns were cold in the middle.  My husband got the French toast half of each one they offered that was amazing !!  I ordered the pineapple upside down cake the first time and it was yummy..  We were seated pretty quickly however getting our actual food took a while.  Next time I got I'll def sick to the breakfast items"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I visited snooze on a Saturday around noon and it was packed. Hostess quoted us 30/40 minutes. It ended up being about an hour, but in all fairness we only wanted to sit inside because they didn't have misters and it was hot.   It was first time at Snooze and our sever Arianna surprised us with their strawberry shortcake pancake. It was AWESOME. I got the pancake flight and tried the blueberry Danish pancake, the pineapple upside down cake pancake and a normal chocolate chip pancake. All were so fluffy and delightful. For me the pineapple upside down cake would be one to skip in be future but I fell in love with the other ones. Also had a mimosa with pomegranate liquor and that was refreshing. My fianc√© got something called snooze spud deluxe( or something like that) and he really enjoyed it as well. He got the Kentucky Coffee too and said it was good if you like strong espresso.   Arianna was so sweet. She gave us the perfect amount of attention. After the wait we had I was nervous about our server being too busy but she really took care of us.   We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Snooze and I'm happy To say it was some of the best bacon I've ever tasted and the coffee is excellent too.   Not sure about the dancing (#oyvey) but it's another great addition to the downtown Gilbert dining scene."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Sandwich I Am and the make your own mimosa with grapefruit juice instead of OJ.    It's cute, the food is good and well priced.... and they text you instead of buzz you for the wait, so you can get some grocery (Whole Foods, TJ) or clothes (Nordstrom Rack) shopping done!  They're also great with to-go/pick-up orders (nevermind the jealous looks of people who are waiting outside)."}
{"text":"The fact that people are willing to wait 30-45 minutes in 100+degree heat for a table here on a Sunday morning, tells a great deal about the quality of the dining experience at Snooze.  The only reason for the 4 star rather than 5star rating is that the server on the patio didn't come to our party and offer drinks while we waited for our table.  I had to go to her umbrella stand and ask her to take our drink orders.  But once seated the food and service are outstanding."}
{"text":"Not bad... but certainly not great.  There are several great breakfast joints in Phoenix and this is not one.   I've been here 3 times and unfortunately the food seems to be getting worse.  Today my toast was black burnt (not dark brown.. black).  Eggs were supposed to be \"over medium\" and were barely cooked.  Service is ok - overall friendly staff.   It just seems that this place could and should be so much better.   I don't get the buzz and long weekend waits... it's really not worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place! But when I went to the Denver location tempe's just kinda fell flat in comparison. Still good food just WOW to Denver and the service is alright, Id say it's off and on. They get busy and the servers get noticeably overwhelmed like I think they under staff. But if you go at the right time then your server will usually chat be attentive and go above expectations:)"}
{"text":"Snooze is my favorite brunch place. I'm so glad one opened up in Tempe. I always get the breakfast pretzel sandwich. My husband gets the Ham Benedict. We LOVE the sweet potato pancake and OMG French Toast. I hope this place never goes out of business!"}
{"text":"Definitely a destination eatery for me in Denver and now in AZ too!  Super cool good food and service.  Price and wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Went there this morning before we had to rush to the PHX airport to catch our flight.  Was about 945a on a Tue morning.  It was only about 1/2 full as we were seated outside.  We waited a good 10-15 min before we had to ask a waiter to get some service.  We saw at least 2 other tables that came after us that were served before us.  Anyway, the waiter apologized and offered to give each of us a free pancake.  Overall, the service was good once you can get their attention.  Keep in mind, the place is only 1/2 full, and there were plenty of servers walking around, so I'm not sure what the excuse would be.    Food wise, my friend got the omelet and I got the hash beef.  As these are simple breakfast items, it's really hard to mess them up.  I think it's because we were short on time, the speed of the service was certainly lacking.  By the time we got our bill, we had to wait another 5 min before our bill was pick up by our waiter.  Granted, we probably should have told him in advance that we were limited on time, but the fact the place is not that busy, we didn't think it would matter.   Bottom line is that the service was good indeed, just the speed of the service could have been better.  As for the taste of food, it's just the basic taste of breakfast, nothing unique to say this is the place I have to come back next time."}
{"text":"I get that every restaurant needs a re-vamp and I'm usually all for it. But this visit to Snooze involved our food taking over a half an hour to be ready, a cricket falling from the ceiling narrowly missing my mimosa, our food being cold, and finding out that they changed the Bloody Mary mix for the gazpacho Bloody Mary, which we came for today specifically for my boyfriend's birthday (which the bartender failed to acknowledge when checking our IDs). The bartenders/food Runner's are sweet as always. This is just not what Snooze used to be and I'm pretty disappointed that we chose to come here today for a birthday celebration. It may be a while, if ever, that we return."}
{"text":"Last day in Tempe and needed some breakfast before boarding the flight.  Stopped by snooze at about 845.   Place was packed so i figured the food was going to be great!   There were no seats left so we sat at the bar.  I ordered corned beef hash with eggs over hard, toast and coffee while my friend ordered french toast and juice.   The coffee came quickly but it was freezing cold outside so i drank the coffee as quickly as it was poured.  They never offered to refill my coffee.  The food finally came out.  The toast was warm and thick and covered in butter.   The eggs that i had asked overhard came out almost over done and scrambled.  The corned beef hash was almost non existent.  It was barly a spoonful.  Although the food did taste good, it was not what i expected."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here. Great breakfast and lunch. Creative offerings. Food is high quality and the service is the best. Friendly staff and management that is willing to take care of every need."}
{"text":"It's always good to have breakfast here. The staff is friendly, they always have a compliment for you.  The food is great, but can get pricey if you want eggs and oatmeal for instance.   The downside is the wait time, especially during the nice weather.  But after about 11:30 am, it seems to clear out a little bit."}
{"text":"Love having a new brunch spot, especially with mimosas on tap! There were a lot of things on the menu that looked good, so I will definitely be back. I had the breakfast burrito this time with half red/half green sauce. It was a ton of food, and I could only eat half of it. The service was great, but there was a long wait to be seated. There is complimentary coffee while you wait, and they'll text you when your table is ready if you want to wander around Nordstrom Rack."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!! We got there fairly early as we read the wait could get long. We only waited about 10 minutes for a table getting there at 8:30 on a Sunday morning. We sat outside and weather was amazing in late October. The service was good and food came out rather quickly. I got the three egg omelet with wild mushrooms, poblano peppers, and avocado. I subbed my toast for a blueberry Danish omelet for $3.50. Great choice though!! The hash browns were awesome!! The kids meals are great as well and only $6.00. My 2-year old got a pancake, fruit, hash browns, and an apple juice. I would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Every town has a \"best brunch spot\" and this may very well be Phoenix(area)'s.  Great, upbeat, fun ambiance.  I sat at the bar.  I ordered a pancake \"flight\".  I'm usually not a \"pancake guy\", but I couldn't resist these.  The flavors are incredibly unique.  It's like a craft brewery take on pancakes.  I did not know that was possible!  Coffee was great, service was prompt and friendly.  Will definitely be back if I'm ever in Phoenix (area) again!"}
{"text":"First time and it is my new favorite breakfast spot!!!! I couldn't decide which of their amazing pancakes to try and they have a \"flight of pancakes\" which you can choose 3- I tried strawberry rhubarb with marscapone cream, blueberry, and sweet potato which has Carmel sauce and pecans- I still can't decide which was my favorite!! Also the waitress was awesome!! She brought us a \"cake of the day\" to try (apple and nuts topped with a cinnamon pastry) which was amazing (salty and sweet) AND when my husband ordered a Bloody Mary, she brought me a complimentary virgin orange snoozius because I'm 9months pregnant and she knew I couldn't have the alcohol. I will definitely be back and often!!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Our server was so friendly. The mimosas were excellent! My SIL and I both ordered pancake flights...yum! The pineapple upside down was especially good. I wish we lived in AZ because this would be our brunch spot."}
{"text":"Great service and even better environment! I had the burrito and wasn't super crazy about it. However, that could just be personal preference. Everything else was phenomenal!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Snooze delivers great food with friendly service. Ordered the pineapple upside down pancakes which were amazing and my husband got the breakfast burrito and could not finish it because the portion was huge! Biggest down side to this place was the wait to be seated (it was just my husband and I and we probably waited 25-30 minutes). We went early on a Sunday morning thinking we would beat the crowd and the place was packed."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Snooze to me as I was only in town for the weekend and it was great! It's in a great spot, you can order drinks while waiting for your table, the staff was super friendly- even offering to hold my carry on bag for me. My mouth dropped open at the choices on the menu and I went with one traditional eggs Benedict and one chili verde eggs Benedict and I should have been slightly embarrassed by how fast I ate them. Fun atmosphere, Go here!!"}
{"text":"I've said it before and I'll say it again, Snooze has THE BEST SERVICE!!!! Sitting at the bar having Andy take care of you is a real treat. He's always smiling and  never too busy to make sure your content with your meal. An addition to the service the food is delish!!!  I have a gluten allergy and this is hands down my favorite breakfast spot. I get to enjoy the most amazing eggs Benedict and mouthwatering gf pancakes. Do yourself a favor and try the gluten free cinnamon roll pancakes. I promise you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"These are probably some of the best pancakes I've ever had. I had the flight with the Blueberry danish, sweet potato, and somoa pancake. All 3 were awesome. My boyfriend had the corned beef hash and that was equally amazing. I recommend the Bangkok Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Awesome grilled cheese with spinach, arugula, and strawberries salad and a perfect tomato soup."}
{"text":"Overall a really good breakfast.  But, really poor execution.    Took way too long to get our waitress to our table after being seated. Clearly looked like our actual waiter was late to work and the rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack.   Nearly $10 for Corned Beef Hash and the portion is rather small.  Definitely not enough potato to meat ratio.   Hello ... Ever heard of a plate warmer?  Pancakes do not stay warm on a room temp plate.  The chocolate cherry daily special was delicious. But, half way through the meal even the best pancake is disappointing cold.  Same with the Pineapple Upside Down pancakes. Really good, but not cold.   Finally, loud grudge crap music has never been \"cool\" - \"hip\" - or whatever term you want to use in a breakfast joint. Who wants to have their hearing assaulted in the morning?"}
{"text":"Excellent chow, friendly/efficient service, bright and airy setting make for a worthy breakfast experience.  Place was busy on a Friday at 830: 10 minute wait on a table.  We opted for the counter, where the service was attentive, even though our server Tori was filling drink orders non-stop. She made sure we got everything we needed, and she topped it off w/ some tasty beverages, my BMary included.  I had scrambled eggs, hash browns and sausage pattie. Menu says 3 eggs, though the serving looked more like 2. Hash browns were tasty, but not as crispy as iike them, and the sausage was alright.  I added pico de gallo to my plate, and it balanced the flavors for me instantly. The rest of the family enjoyed their breakfasts, the pancakes and bfast tacos very well received, and we all left satisfied. I'll return!  Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"Very clean cool place to eat breakfast. Service is stellar we met many staff on our first trip here quite friendly. The food is good stuff bit of a twist on some dishes that turns out to be a success for sure. Bit packed weekends but stop in during the week to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast placeCan't say enough. I could eat here everyday for a week and wouldn't taste half of all my favs!! Having a full bar and amazing signature drinks helps. Here's a sneak peak....."}
{"text":"Update: I was contacted by Kelcie with Snooze AM and she offered a genuine apology. In her response, it was clear that they take pride in providing excellent customer service. I really appreciated the sincere response I received. Thank you!   I found this review in my drafts and apparently forgot to post it after our visit a few months ago:  We have been to the Snooze AM Scottsdale location and we always had a fantastic experience, so we were hoping the Gilbert location would be great as well.  When we arrived, we were seated almost immediately and the server was very friendly. The food took a while to come out after we ordered, but we were in no hurry. When the food finally arrived, the person who brought the food out was snippy, which made it all the more difficult to have to tell her that my order was incorrect. This clearly was an inconvenience to her. A few minutes later, the original sever came by and saw there was an issue with the order and said a new burrito would be out shortly.  The new burrito eventually came out, but by that time my entire family had already finished their meals, and the plates had been cleared. Our kids were starting to get restless, so my husband took them outside. I ate my food as quickly as possible and left. This visit was a bit of a let down, but we love the food so we will likely give them another chance in the future."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Sunday and of course they were crowded. We were told it would be a 45 minute wait time but actually wait time was just 15 minutes. We ate outside, next to a heater.   The location is in the ASU college area, so their was a lot of college students. We started out with mimosas. I ordered the Om French toast and  my fianc√© had the breakfast burrito. The mimosa were great. The atmosphere was marvelous being outside amongst the chirping birds. Although it was 50 degrees it was still comfortable because of the numerous heaters. The service was excellent, staff very pleasant and welcoming. Checked on us numerous times . The food was delicious, wanted to order a second plate because it was so good. Definitely, a five star!!!!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy Snooze. I've had many of their dishes and I always go back to one of the bennies. My friend loves Juan's breakfast tacos also and the mimosas are on point!"}
{"text":"Had Jessica twice over this past weekend! Super friendly & amazing service- rockstar!   Food is always delicious"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite go to breakfast spot! NEED I say more! The place is always full of smiling guest and staff! The Ambience and atmosphere although is joyful. I've been here a few times and i can't say I ever seen an out of order or dirty establishment. If you go the this location you won't receive bad customer service or cold food. I'd recommend this place to anyone check out the pics. Mouthwatering!"}
{"text":"The wait for this place was 20ish min on a Saturday, so not the worst but also not the best. I hear downtown Gilbert is getting super popular with the new hipster shops and restaurants popping up, so maybe this is the new normal for the area. The place is eye-catching, and the decor is trendy with pops of orange accents.   The weather was gorgeous out, so we were able to sit outside and take in a little sun while we were waiting already starving haha. We were told there was complimentary coffee while we waited, but it was out and we kind of just stood there looking awkward and waiting for them to refill We all had variations of the benedicts, and were pleased but not blown away. We all agreed it was solid and could definitely compare to the bennies in SF that we endured an hour-long wait for. Seems like a solid place to hang out with friends for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"I wanted pancakes but I also wanted Eggs Benedict. You see, this is the problem when you travel by yourself. You can't get two plates and share. Well, you *can* still get two plates but then you're just being a pig.  Since I was so indecisive today, I got a \"Benny Duo\" where you can have one Benedict of one type and one of another. The first was with smoked salmon on a slice of pumpernickel. Tasty and excellent. The egg was perfect. The second was with green chile and a potato base of some sort. Also excellent. The chile had a little bit of a zing to it and it improved with a bit of Cholula.  Service was excellent, sitting at the breakfast counter. Coffee was refilled and it was good coffee."}
{"text":"I am writing this because it has been 2 days and I am still annoyed. I went to Snooze on a Thursday morning at 6:15 believing they were open. I walked up to the door and tried opening it, which it was locked. A lady was cleaning the door and instead of smiling or acknowledging my presence, she completely ignored me. She didn't say what time they were open until I asked and again never smiled. I am a firm believer of customer service and regardless of the situation, if you work in customer service, you should always be kind and considerate acknowledging anyone that helps pay your bills."}
{"text":"The wait is worth it! And in Saturday morning you can visit the local farmers market while you wait. Excellent breakfasts  and the BEST BACON I have ever had! Serious Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a gem, and Arizona is lucky to have a couple franchises located around town. The food is amazing, and will not disappoint. The cool atomic/ retro vibe makes for a fun and interesting atmosphere. Staff is overall very friendly, and they try their best to get you handled right away even though the place is always packed.  I recently ordered a very large catering order for a business meeting, and I was so impressed how well they put the food together. Cute boxes, warm food, and extremely happy guests at my meeting...I felt like I really stepped my party planning skills up! I actually heard one of them squeal in excitement that we got Snooze for breakfast. Do yourselves a favor, and go now!"}
{"text":"OK.  But definitely the place to be and be seen."}
{"text":"Im not a pancake person but it was pretty good. Sandiago, CA seems better than the PHX restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome staff, amazing food. We need one in Tucson!! I've never waited so long or been so happy I did. Of course it was Mother's Day so waiting was absolutely expected! Not typically a \"sweet breakfast\" kind of person but their blueberry danish pancake was just the right amount of sweet and something I would absolutely go back for. However, the real surprise was the breakfast pot pie. Incredible. I thought no way would this be good but I tried it and I will never be the same."}
{"text":"Well the thing is that if you wait 45 minutes for a table you expect that your food is going to be hot or at least kinda warm once you get it, unfortunately it was not. It was pretty packed too so the food took awhile to come out. I found the blueberry pancake to be borderline disgusting, it didn't even have blueberries in it. It was just not very good blueberry sauce and watery frosting. I would have given this place 1 star but the server was pretty good considering how busy she was. I definitely won't be coming back and don't understand the hype. I would prefer IHOB over this place."}
{"text":"The food is so good, the service is always top notch, and their cocktails are stellar. The only reason I'd give 4 out of 5 stars is because it's a challenge to get into this place. It's no surprise they're always on a wait, it's a really great place to have breakfast. Shout out to one of the servers Joe, we try to get him if he's there. He's funny and treats his guests right"}
{"text":"Always love coming here! I'm not a big sweets person (especially for breakfast) but OH MY their pineapple upside down pancake is ahhmazing. I definitely recommend checking this place out if you haven't yet. Just be cautious that there's usually a wait (and for good reason)."}
{"text":"Really good, high quality food. It is one of my favorite spots for breakfast! I have been here a few times and they never disappoint. The ambience of the restaurant is very hip and open. Others too like this place, so there usually is a long wait on the weekends-we went on a Monday afternoon and there was no wait and plenty of space for our big party.   I had the Breakfast pot pie, with a side of hashbrowns. Everything on the plate was delicious, it is a dish I have not seen anywhere else. If you haven't been here or are a regular, it is something to try on their menu. The portions seemed rather hearty, so come hungry; if not, sharing is always an option.!"}
{"text":"Yeah just like most Snooze locations, it's really hard to go wrong when dining at one. If you're a fan of brunch and breakfast, then this place is for you.  Pancakes? They got 'em. French Toast? They got that. Other breakfast and brunch stuff...yeah, whatever, they go that too. There's just too much good stuff on the menu.  Just like any other Snooze location, their decor is sleek, colorful and modern...and classy. Well, at least that's how I feel each time I dine. On top of that, I've never had bad service at a Snooze location and this visit was no different. That's pretty good considering that I think the entire staff is probably attending ASU which is literally across the street. Like seriously, across the street. Anyway, the server was very friendly.  \"So what did you have, Jeff? I really want to know. That's why I'm reading this review.\"...said no one ever. However, if you must ask, I had the Drunken Monkey French Toast. Why? Because I love French Toast, and the name was intriguing...and the description sounded good.  Funny story, it was good. The End.  Okay not really the end.  Although the portion size was a little smaller than your typical Jeff S. standards would consider worthy, the fact that it was a nicely arranged dish of carbs in the form of sugar, bread,fruit...and sugar, it was good enough for me to overlook the less than Herculean serving size (i.e., mere mortal serving size). Yeah, the rest of you normal eaters will probably be fine. I'll be sure to include the obligatory picture.  So would I eat here again? I'm pretty sure the answer to that should be pretty obvious, but in case you are fairly dense, the answer is \"yes\". Why? Because I love the food, the atmosphere and well, breakfast food in general. The only downside is that currently I don't find myself in this part of town that often, but no need to worry, I'm sure at some point in time I'll make my way back and this place will be at the top of my breakfast list."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in the heart of downtown Gilbert! I love going here on a Sunday afternoon because they're open until 2:30pm and serve up their delicious breakfast items until then.  I like their tofu scramble and they also have soyrizo if you want a little kick! Their menu doesn't have many vegan options listed, but just ask and they can cook something up for you. I usually get a tofu scramble, which comes with a side of hashbrowns and they'll cook it solely in oil if you ask. Their normal oil is an oil/butter mixture, so if you're vegan like me, that's a no go...but they're able to accommodate.   Their fresh fruit is awesome too...usually comprised of blueberries, strawberries, and pineapple. I love fruit like that....that's not all melon.  I haven't tried any adult beverages there yet but their mimosas look divine!"}
{"text":"This place is great! On the weekends it's a mad house, but any weekday morning you shouldn't have to worry about a wait. It's a fun atmosphere, they play classic 80s music and the staff is a bit quirky themselves. The pulled pork is my favorite. But if you're thinking you want a full portion I'd definitely skip it or plan on ordering more.  I've ordered items with the pulled pork a few times hoping for a decent portion but it never happens. They offer great food and have a wide variety of coffee options."}
{"text":"Wonderful kind and personable service. There was a mix-up between the difference of a double shot and single shot but luckily it wasn't alcohol. The server and manager were quick to remedy the miscommunication. Usually we have to get our coffee from a coffee shop and food from somewhere else. This place has it all. Thank-you Snooze for the yummy brunch and strong coffee. We now can see our colors much more vividly."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice now and been blown away each time. The Benedict dishes are outstanding, and I like the way you can try two as a meal. You can do a variety-of-an-item-option for the pancakes as well... and it's a good thing with choices like Sweet Potato, Blueberry Danish and Peach Pie Pancakes (say that 5 times fast!) This past visit, we had the Pineapple Upside Down Pancake, and oh. my. god. The coffee is high quality... and I'm a bit of a coffee snob. We enjoyed reading the story about it on the nifty tri-fold drink menu gracing each table, though I was so involved with that ridiculous pancake, I've forgotten where they buy it from. Great stuff all around."}
{"text":"The first time I came here a few months ago I immediately liked the place the decor and the atmosphere were light and fun and I enjoyed my breakfast especially the cinnamon roll pancakes I was in for my second visit on Monday looked like the same place but sure did not taste the same ordered the corned beef hash and it was very skimpy and greasy and some how two out of the four drinks we ordered from the bar had a bug in it they did remake them and they took 20% off our bill with so many other places in the area probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Holy crap, if I could give a place six stars I absolutely would. The extensive menu selection should not be the only thing that makes you want to come here; service was great, they messed up part of our order and fixed it quickly and didn't charge us. Sweet and sour combinations for breakfast are incredible. My only gripe with my meal which was eggs with pesto or something of that sort... There was so much pesto it was really hard to taste anything else. But this for sure is an amazing breakfast place. The sweet potato pancakes are delightful."}
{"text":"If you love pancakes, you would be in heaven! they are sooooo moist and flavourful, but the sweetness is just about right.   The pineapple upside down one has sooo much things going on, while not overpowering the pineapple flavour from the pancakes. The chocolate ones are sooo chocolaty but yet not overly sweet.  The chorizo side is really tasty; mixed their hashbrown with one of their hot sauces was another good option if you choose to go the savory route. but you can always add a little extra and have the pancakes to come with your savory brunch dish, so you don't have to face the sweet or savory dilemma :D"}
{"text":"Snooze has a fun atmosphere. I also love their many eggs benedict options. My kids love their pancakes of course. Most things are pretty great here. Coffee isn't amazing and the bill can be a little pricey for our family of 5. Still, when we see this chain, we know we'll get some good, consistent food."}
{"text":"Fabulous brunch place!! I love the sweet stuff on the menu. The specialty pancakes are amazing!  There is parking available in the asu Fulton garage if you can't find a meter."}
{"text":"My friend who used to live in Denver, where I believe Snooze is based, told me before they opened that the food was wonderful. Well, she was right. I can't believe my good fortune that they moved into the Town & Country in my 'hood. I came after a doctor's appt because I was starving from fasting.   I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by the friendly bartender. Another lady saw my bandage from having blood drawn and was considerate enough to ask me if I wanted a piece of toast or something. I ended up ordering a \"flight\" of pancakes where you can order 1 of 3 different flavors. Whoever decided to offer that option is, in my opinion, a brilliant person. I also love that they have such distinct and interesting pancake options. I ended up noshing on carrot cake (which ended up being the fave), sweet potato and a \"pancake of the day\" which had chocolate chips and cherries. I got a side of the house-made chicken sausage which was amazing. I'm not sure what herbs they seasoned with but it looks like a pounded, cubed steak. But it was very moist and not too salty.   I've only been back there another time since and I exercised the half and half option for their \"art of hollandaise\" items. Another great option! I got to try two kinds of but the winner was the Havana Benny. Here's the description: Shaved Niman Ranch ham and slow roasted pork served over a savory Swiss cheese bread pudding and topped with poached eggs, Dijon hollandaise and diced house pickles. The ham was really the winning ingredient here but all of it came together nicely.   I noticed this place draws a varying demographic. I saw families with kids and grandmas like one would see at IHOP. But I also saw hipsters on the patio and at the bar. I'm not sure if the place's popularity is at play or because it's new, but weekends, expect an hour wait for brunch. Otherwise, try to go on a week day."}
{"text":"Not really worth the hype. My husband had the \"awesome\" eggs benedict duo that everyone raves about - they are very small and just okay. I had the blueberry danish pancakes and they were good, but anything with THAT much sugar involved is going to be good. Other than the cream cheese topping they were pretty standard, I only ate half because I don't want to get diabetes.   We went early beat the crowds (7:30AM on a Saturday). The service and cold brew coffee were great but the food is not good enough for the price and usual wait time required. There are much better options nearby for quality breakfasts."}
{"text":"Snooze is just what I need when in Tempe.  On hot summer's days I like to get my fill to prepare for the sweaty day.  On this particular day at Snooze, coffee was ordered and so was what they called a breakfast pot pie.  And HOW GOOD IS THIS sausage gravy?  So delicious! The biscuits were flaky and I ordered the egg over easy (this was alright...)  The real surprise on my plate was the circle thick hash browns...it appeared to be cupped and cooked.  The environment was fun and we didn't have to wait too long to get a seat."}
{"text":"Yummy place! Got free pancakes , the burrito was delicious the French toast was delicious and the pancakes where delicious!  Coffee is muy Bueno too"}
{"text":"If this were my last breakfast--- Id be happy. Absolutely the best egg white, spinach, red pepper and bacon omelette I've ever eaten. Delicious! Worth the wait. If you're lucky you can grab a seat at the counter. Not s long of a weight."}
{"text":"I love this place! Occasionally on a Friday, my co-worker and I will sneak over for a delicious breakfast burrito - so worth it. The customer service is great. We've ordered to-go meals and were offered a coffee while we waited outside by the fountain. Most recently, we were seated, but a server was not assigned to our table. We notified the first server we saw who informed us of the error. Our servers were over shortly after, but the original server we notified made it a point to check on us and even brought a pancake of goodness over while we waited for our food. Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast! Service was amazing & fun. These people seem to really live what they do! Lots of good for you & not so healthily breakfast choices with tons of flavor! Definitely recommend if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Looked it up on yelp decided to check it out. Cool Place for it being so trendy. Food was great so was the service"}
{"text":"They say insanity is repeating the same action expecting a different result. I have been to several locations of Snooze throughout the valley and while the food tastes good, it always arrives at my table at room temperature. I like hot food so to stop the insanity I will not return to Snooze."}
{"text":"The Ham Benedicts lll was ok. The ham was very tasty but the hollandaise sauce lacked the lemony taste I expected and was too thin."}
{"text":"Two of the meals I've had here were easily two of the most delicious meals I have ever had. Service is super friendly. They have multiple kinds of hollandaise.  The wait can be kinda long on weekends. We have waited 45 minutes a couple of times. It was worth the wait though.  Restroom is good."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and best server, Tori, who is cute as a bunny.  We went for breakfast on a Friday around 8:30.  It wasn't busy then but it was  really starting to jump when we left.    I tried one of their 'known for' dishes, corned beef hash.  It was excellent, not dry, and had a beautiful crunch.  The eggs were cooked perfectly also.  I tried a bite of my boyfriend's caramel apple pancake and now I'm obsessed with trying to recreate this at home.  Back to Tori...very sweet and efficient and offered to get us to go cups of our coffee/tea.    I'm hoping work will bring me back soon so I can visit again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Snooze AM Tempe last weekend, second visit to the chain and the first at this location.  Atmosphere - Nice layout, we had a table inside but would look to sit outside as the weather changes. My only dislike was having the A/C vents pointed right at some tables which made it too cold when it kicked on.  Service - Great. The estimated wait time was exactly what they quoted. The waitress was great in her very positive demeanor and her speed. Food came out very quick which was a plus.  Food - Really good and creative menu. Breakfast Pot Pie - Tasty and the perfect size for my wife, the crust is very flakey and gravy is good. Snooze Spuds Deluxe - Good dish and if I were to re-order I'd make two changes to my order. First, don't order the chorizo, it tasted nothing like chorizo and I even asked the waitress if it wasn't the chicken sausage but she confirmed it was chorizo. Second, take their recommendation to put an egg or two on top, without them it is a little too dry. I'd like to them to put on a little more cheese on it.  Overall, a very good place and I'm going up to four stars based on the service."}
{"text":"First time here and came in for a Saturday brunch around 1pm. Overall this was a great choice for a weekend brunch and will be going back.  Seating/Atmosphere - Greeted when we entered and after short wait for a table to open we were seated. Very pleasant staff. Open format, music, great for families or adults. It is not quiet and I can see where the music volume is close to making it unenjoyable. Too hot for the outdoor seating but will go back when the weather cools down to sit outside.   Service - Very good, she was pleasant, smiling and covered everything. I wouldn't call it fast but they were full. Service speed and attention needs to pick up to get to 5 stars. Everyone that worked there seemed to be having fun, keeping the atmosphere upbeat.  Food - Everything was very good. MMM MMM Mimosa - The best morning drink I've had in a while, the pomegranate liquor added flavor and worked with the OJ. Corned Beef Hash - A good portion of corned beef hash that worked with the caramelized poblano chilies they added. The hash had chunks of corned beef mixed with the hash brown, not soggy like I've had at other locations. Eggs were cooked perfectly to my order.  OMG Fresh Toast - Can't say enough about this dish, perfect blend of flavors. Stuffed with mascarpone and then topped with vanilla cr√®me, salted caramel, fresh strawberries and toasted coconut.  It had a perfect balance and wasn't overly sweet.  Really cool menu with at least four more items that I want to go back to try, which will be very soon. Then I'll go back to try them all a few more times."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place with a friend when we were on this side of town and glad that we did! It was about 110 degrees that day, so luckily we were able to be seated in an outdoor table right away. Otherwise, it would have been about a 45-50 minute wait. Although the heat made it a bit uncomfortable, the patio area is completely shaded so it wasn't too awful. Service was pretty prompt and prices were reasonable.   Judging from what other people were ordering, it seems like they're known for their pancakes. For those who can't decide which pancakes to get, you can pick 2 different ones with the same price and still be charged that same amount! My friend decided upon the sweet potato pancake and the pineapple upside down pancake. They were nice enough to put them on separate plates too so that you can taste each one individually. Both were really good, and the sweetness was not overdone with too much cream or syrup like in some other places. I ordered the Early Harvest Benny, which was delicious - egg was poached perfectly and I never knew pesto could go so well with Hollandaise sauce!  If I HAD to complain about something, the hash browns were just OK. My preference is having them a bit crisper on the outside. Having an outdoor cooling mist would have been nice too on a hot day. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal would would come back for sure. A lot of brunch places put emphasis on quantity over quality and it's nice to see there's one that doesn't make the same sacrifice! I'd give this a 4.5, but since there are no half stars on here, I'll give the benefit of the doubt and round up to a 5."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday because I was working nearby at the Biltmore Resort.  I ordered the breakfast tacos on flour tortillas.  It was really tasty.  I was surprised that they offered a creamy aioli type sauce on the side instead of salsa, since it was tacos, but the sauce turned out to be a good addition to the tacos.  The amount of food was just right for me, which means that most other people would need to order a side or something to feel full.  The food is excellent, but I could do without the loud club music playing over the speakers at noon on a Thursday...."}
{"text":"Awesome food and the best service every time I come they were so nice and took care of my dog like he was a paying customer. Love this place, try the corned beef and the snooze fashioned. Will be coming back as much as possible."}
{"text":"Cool spot in downtown Tempe. The decor takes you back to more retro times.  Fav dish: chilaquiles benedict"}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast on a Saturday morning before there was a wait for a table. There was a wait as we were leaving. Everything was very good... great service, and great food. We enjoyed the Eggs Benedict, Pancakes, and an egg dish. All worth having again. The patio was hopping and there are tables where folks had their dogs too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Snooze easily tops my list of best breakfast spots in the area. The atmosphere, service, and food are all excellent. I love how easy it is to customize the meal, and everyone I dined with agreed the food was delicious. Even the coffee is good which is not always true at many breakfast spots."}
{"text":"The staff is not only cute and spunky, they are great at their jobs. I had eggs and hash browns , both of which were perfect. And I just couldn't resist so I ordered the peanut butter cup pancake and it was, by far, the best pancake I've ever eaten! I wish we had one of these in Dallas!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere. Waitress was great and even brought us a delicious special that wasn't on the menu. I would go again! Bloody Mary was amazing too!"}
{"text":"\"I will choose to do what I can fabulously.\" ? Clinton Kelly  And on a warm sunny morning, I chose to brunch fabulously!  The wait on Saturday was about an hour.  There was a surplus of people shopping at the Farmer's Market and downtown Gilbert is just generally a nightmare on the weekends.  But the wait is well worth it once you're seated in front of some eggs benedict and a nice cold Michelada.  These are the moments that makes waking up insanely early for spin class well worth it.  I love the Benny Duo.  I like being able to choose two different eggs benedict options and try out more than one flavor profile.  I had chosen The Benny Goodman and Bella! Bella! Benny.  The poached eggs on both benedicts were cooked to perfection.  I don't think I've had poached eggs done to this level of perfection.  One poke and it was just spewing liquid gold all over my plate. Bliss.  Anyways, let's talk benedicts:  Benny Goodman [Lox style salmon and cream cheese served over toasted rye and topped with poached cage free eggs, cream cheese hollandaise blended with sun dried tomato and caper relish]:  I love me a good lox and bagel in the morning so when I saw that Snooze offered it in benedicts form, I had to order it.  I just love salmon so much!  Rye bread is also my choice of bread as well so it was really a no-brainer.  I got to say though, the Benny Goodman left some to be desired.  The pieces of salmon were so minuscule that it could easily be forgotten.  If they offered more pieces of salmon and in bigger chunks, it would be great.  Bella! Bella! Benny [Thin slices of prosciutto, Taleggio cheese, and perfectly poached eggs on toasted ciabatta, topped with cream cheese hollandaise, balsamic glaze and arugula. Ciao Bella!]: Now the Bella Bella was pretty great.  I loved the saltiness from the prosciutto and the peppery taste of the arugula.  It was a well-balanced combination.    So yes.  I love Snooze and will be back.  They're food is well executed, prices are great, and the wait time is bearable.  That Bangkok Bloody Mary is insane.  Grab a glass and wait for a table because it's worth your wait!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!! But be aware that there's always a bit of a waiting time, since it's packed! What I recommended would be to sit at the bar if you're solo. Staff is friendly even when it's very busy. They take your order right away so you don't wait around. Food is extraordinary. Undecided between two? No problem. They have the option of half order of one and half order of the other. And I was really pleased to taste the Bella Bella Benny and the Benny Goodman. The Italian version of the eggs Benedict comes on ciabatta bread and balsamic drizzle. Delicious! The acidity of the balsamic makes an excellent contrast with the sweetness of the hollandaise sauce. The goodman salmon one was also good, but I wouldn't order it again. They also have items a la carte if you don't want the preselected side. I would be back, maybe on earlier hours to skip the line! ;-)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here. The food was great. However the service was very slow. Which was somewhat disappointing for my birthday brunch. Other than that we had a nice time. Their mimosas and Bellinis were Very tasty."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite brunch joint that I've found so far in Phoenix.  I've had the Early Harvest Benny (delicious and filling yet feels somewhat healthy - mushrooms are good for you, right?) and the Breakfast Pot Pie (you walk out feeling like you just ate a camel), and both were great in their own way.  Looking at all the other satisfied customers around me, though, I can tell that I haven't even made a dent into all the delicious offerings on the menu.  Prices are very reasonable, and service is friendly.  Even better - a large variety of alcoholic brunch drinks!  Perfect for coming off a night shift.  They even have some sort of drink special for medical providers on certain mornings (yay, thank you Snooze!!!!).    Can't wait for my next night month."}
{"text":"Look. STOP, don't even continue the research for a breakfast place if that's what you're looking for.   This is the place you were looking for. It may be busy with a justified wait but you'll be very happy."}
{"text":"Recently checked this little place out and I am so glad I did! It's a bit hard to get to, since it is practically on ASU campus. My advice is if you see a parking space even vaguely nearby, take it.The meters take card and are cheap, but the garage next door has always been somewhere in the range of $10 cash. Blah. Onto the food! Amazing! I ordered the Snooze Continental that consists of a grapefruit brulee (a half grapefruit with caramelized sugar over the top), 2 pieces of toast and greek yogurt with house granola/drizzled honey on top! Delicious and pretty healthy too.Seriously some of THE BEST breakfast food I have had. The latte was good and the environment was nice and for being on campus, it isn't deafeningly loud like a lot of college places are. Service was great and friendly! Will return, and if I can get over the parking situation, I can see it becoming a favorite! A plus too when they didn't talk smack over my U of A card ;)"}
{"text":"Such a cool place for breakfast!  Incredibly creative dishes.  My husband couldn't decide between the many variations of eggs Benedict, but they had an option to pick two different ones, how awesome is that?  They also have a similar option for pancakes (too many delicious flavors to choose from so you can pick three)!  The food was delicious.  Oh and the service was stellar - Joe was so friendly and attentive, he started our day off right.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My roommate and I decided to try this place for a late brunch on a Saturday.  The wait was about 40-50 minutes but that was something we expected. Luckily they text you when your table is ready so we did a bit of shopping while we waited. Our waitress was really nice and attentive despite the morning rush. I ordered the Ham Benedict III which was absolutely delicious, and my roommate had the Sandwich I Am which was also very tasty. Both came with hash browns that were amazing! It was a tiny bit loud, but otherwise a very pleasant atmosphere!  Overall a great experience, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. They text to notify you when your table is ready. Plus they have a ping pong table and games to keep you entertained during your wait. This helped a lot with our 9 yr old. Barely noticed the time go by. Free coffee and good music. Good brunch spot for the central phoenix folk. Any place that has a good selection of eggs benedict wins with me."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for sooooo long. Just needed someone to get up early on a Sunday and come with! It was after noon when we arrived (Sorry, I hate mornings!) and it was quite busy but there is a lot of seating so the wait time was expected to be only 20-30 minutes. We opted to sit at the bar instead where you can select off their Breakfast Cocktail menu (whaaaaa???) and enjoy dining there instead of having to wait. The morning cocktails are nothing less of fabulous. Traditional mimosas OR, one's with pineapple juice, or with tequila instead of OJ and then each one has a little special twist to it. Ours were very blah and mostly just juice so I asked the bartender to add more alcohol. She did so that was nice. Her service unfortunately was not so hot. She just seemed like she didn't want to be there and that we were just a nusiance to her for the most part. We had to remind her and wait quite a while to get water that we asked for and to place an order. I would have rated it higher based on the food and drinks but the service was just less than mediocre. So then I go right to, well I can just go to TC Eggington's or BLD for great food and at least the service is typically friendlier. I would probably go again if in that area but I can't see going out of my way. The breakfast menu itsef was pretty impressive and I went with the OMG french toast but it didn't blow me away. Not quite as much flavor and sweetness I was expecting but still a very nice dish. He ordered the Benny Goodman which was an open faced breakfast sandwich with poached egg and salmon and asked for sauces/accompaniments on the side. Not something I would ever want to have but he seemed to like it. It's a nice place. Great area. You can browse around the Rack or hop over to Biltmore to shop after. But I am big on being treated like you want me there and want me to come back and they, I can honestly say, did not!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Now I understand why they're always so busy.  Great food, friendly service, super cute patio. I had the pancake flight, and it changed my life"}
{"text":"I enjoyed going to snooze, but I don't think I'll go back.  First off, the wait to get in to this place is ridiculous.  The food is not quite good enough to merit the wait, in other words the food quality to wait ratio is a bit off.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good, and even better than most breakfast places, but at the end of the day I'd much rather wait for something incredible rather than good.  The atmosphere of the place is super weird.  It's like the Jetsons meets your grandmothers newly redone kitchen.  Doesn't really mesh well.    At the end of the meal, I was satisfied, but I asked myself, \"does this feel unique?\" and my answer was no.  In all aspects it felt like a chain restaurant.  The service was friendly but not personal.  The food was tasty but not exceptional.    I think three stars is the right score, and A-OK is the right rating."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I didn't enjoy the music they had on. And the mimosas are not my favorite.  I'm thinking they use a dry champagne? I probably won't go back. There are way to many nice breakfast jounts!"}
{"text":"So good, love this place. Great food, good drinks. Little pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"Worst service!! First I would like to say I never do this. But we were excited to go try it out. Got there in time not really busy. Had service right away took our order and never saw our waitress again. I had to ask 2 different waiters for drinks.  When they second waiter told our waitress she just looked pissied off. Food was terrible not worth 40$  we will never go back.. wast of time and money.good luck if you go!"}
{"text":"We just love this place! Our server was Savannah,  we had to ask because it said Sav Blanc on the check! Haha! Loved it....anyways, my dad was in town from Reno and had a blueberry pancake, which he loved! My niece and I had the loaded hashbrowns and the pancake flight. We tried the sweet potato, pineapple upside down and blueberry danish....omg....yum! Sister had the breakfast pot pie and brother had French toast with fruit. Everything was amazing as well as the service. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Wow! Just fantastic. Picture this....its 10 am in what is about to become a 115¬∞ day in Phx and we walk in and they say immediate seating on the patio. The niece and I look at each other but our hunger takes over and we agree to go for it. We're approached by Joe, who cracks a joke about her ordering a cappuccino but she hasn't had her coffee yet so she does not care that it's gonna be a scorcher today. He helps us navigate the menu and we ordered the pancake flight which we had about 6 choices (you get 3) and we chose pineapple upside down cake with a creme anglaise, sweet potato with brown butter butter and the daily special which was like a smoothie kind of flavor on a white chocolate pancake. Yum!! We also shared the hash browns with cheese and 2 choices of meats, sauces or veggies. We got onions, bacon and spinach (.75). Plenty to share. 2 drinks later and 31 bucks. Totally reasonable and absolutely delicious. Top all that off with Joe's amazing service and you have a recipe for \"Im going back\"!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast joint I have ever been to.  The most creative and delicious pancake combinations I've have ever seen.  If your not a fan of pancakes this place also scrambles eggs to perfection and makes the most succulent pieces of bacon. The wait staff is personable pleasant and the service is always speedy.  The only downside is the long wait times that is always indicative of good food and great service"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing ! We used to love butters and all those other places until we discovered snooze it's clean food, fresh and delicious it can't get better than this !!! LOVE the benny goodman Benedict !"}
{"text":"This is one of the finest places for breakfast in Tempe. It is right at the little village at ASU.  It is a must when you are in town."}
{"text":"Never knew pancakes could be prepared in so many wonderful ways! I'd recommend the pancake sampler (3) and indulge in some new varieties, including the pancake of the day.   I also ordered the chicken patty. It was flavorful, but a bit more salty than I'd prefer."}
{"text":"Stylish and eclectic atmosphere with really yummy breakfast food! Staff is nice and attentive, very good place for breakfast or brunch. This particular location can get kind of crowded and difficult to get to though because the college is so close. Also, you have to pay for parking and may have a walk a distance. However, it's close to a parking garage (still have to pay and walk, but it's covered!). Recommended for a brunch once in a while!"}
{"text":"Fun, FUN brunch place. Snooze really has it's own unique ambiance...a little bit like a fun diner, a lot like a modern bistro, and mostly just an overall great place to eat. There's not as much of a wait on weekdays, if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Today was my first Snooze experience and I cannot wait to go back! I want to try everything on the menu! Perfect portion sizes and appropriate pricing. The caramel apple mimosa is delicious! Definitely a new favorite. Love the trendy, upbeat atmosphere as well as great service. Would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Where to begin? The food and the service was nothing short of perfection!   Right in the center of AZ State University. A very hipster spot with college kids flowing in and out. A nice stop for breakfast/brunch.   Prices are moderately fair. I recommend the breakfast burrito. Very filling and delicious."}
{"text":"Food was really yummy!! The service was great also!! Definitely go back again! Hot Chocolate was delicious wish it was a little warmer.. And the OMG French Toast was divine!! It started to rain they put up umbrella's fast and the heaters were on because it was windy and cold!!"}
{"text":"The service is awesome, Caitlin was the best! The corned beef was the best I have had anywhere in the USA! Add to that the great bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"I am sort of torn between two or three stars. I have had really great service and meals here that I would rate as four or five stars, yet I have also had around the same number of experiences that were pretty awful.  If you come here on one of the good days, you can expect great breakfast food for a somewhat higher than average cost. Although, when they are on point the prices are completely worth it for the meal.   Be warned though, when they fall short of loose dining standards, your experience can be very negative. I'm not sure if they have off days or times or what, but if you are unfortunate enough to come on one of those days here is what you can expect (and what has happened to me several times now): a server whom is either incompetent or rude (they read the same sometimes), wrong or missing items when you receive your meal, undercooked or overcooked food (ex. Bacon can be slimy and transparent or burnt black and hard), an empty water and coffee cup the entire time you are there, and an overwhelming sense of dissatisfaction when you just spent $30 on a breakfast that Denny's could've put to shame for $5.   All in all, try this place out. When they do things right this place is awesome. Just be weary of those \"off\" times."}
{"text":"I have visited twice. My timing was good, no wait. Bonus! The food is wonderful. My daughter swears by the pancakes, the usual flavors plus a daily special flavor. The bennies are the best. The harvest and the Goodman are fantastic! The downside has been the service, especially bad on my first visit, better more recently.  Worth the visit."}
{"text":"This is a great modern eatery. The food is not traditional. The chefs have imagination and creativity. The flavors are great. The variety of pancakes is amazing. The pot pie was flavor sensation. This is a go. Be aware peak times have waits so be ready. Can't knock them a star for that. If you make great food you'll have a wait."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the slowest breakfast place in Arizona. Took the waiter 17 minutes to bring a drink. Improve your service and your attitude. They also have plenty of people waiting and plenty of empty tables. Quit trying to have people spend money on drinks and actually seat them! The food is good but for the service why pay the high prices?!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, great food, even better service!! I recommend sitting at the breakfast bar. Get the eggs benedict, because that is living, my friends."}
{"text":"Delicious! Eggs benedict mix and match? Yes please! perfect place for a relaxing Sunday brunch with delicious mimosa options.  Definitely making it a more regular spot."}
{"text":"Iced mocha and Snooze Spuds Deluxe are always fantastic! Great atmosphere and don't forget the open seating at the bar if the wait is to long"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great   The only thing us older people didn't care for was the music. The service and food was great"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of great things about this place and woke up early enough to go eat breakfast before the morning rush. We got there at about 7:30am on a Saturday and was quickly greeted by the host and taken to our table. We ordered the mmm mm mimosa and Bangkok bloody mary. The mimosa was good and very tart and gave me a nice buzz. the Bangkok bloody mary was very interesting but had a lingering fish sauce taste that I think most people might not like. We ordered the OMG french toast and the Reuben and the dishes were pretty amazing! the french toast was fluffy and soft and very flavorful. the corned beef was tender and delicious and I loved the soft pretzel bun! The d√©cor is very cute and welcoming and we will definitely come back again to try their pancakes!"}
{"text":"I have been to Snooze 5 times, but have only eaten here twice. The 3 times I was forced to turn away were because of 60-75 minute wait times.   The food is great and I have been pleased with all of the meals and drinks I have sampled off their menu, but the current trendiness and long wait times make me more likely to choose a different breakfast place in this area.   It's not really justifiable to eat here unless you really have a lot of time on your hands. Today we waited 35 minutes to be sat and another 40 waiting for food. Staff was friendly and pleasant and the patio table we sat at was very nice, but, again, it's just a crazy amount of time to devout to breakfast.  If they could find a way to seat and feed people in a more reasonable amount of time, Snooze would be worth WAY more stars."}
{"text":"If you're going to Snooze, get there about an hour before you plan on being hungry. The wait is crazy. We have tried to go 2 prior times and was advised of waits in excess of 75 minutes... For eggs!? Needless to say, we didn't wait.   We arrived today and only had to wait for 35 minutes, which seemed reasonable given the other wait experiences.   We were seated and noticed the decor to be nice and the service to be friendly. The food was good, albeit smaller portion than I expected for $11.50. The Bloody Mary was a little blah, nothing special and the coffee was decent.  It was good. Not great.   I will be back... Depending on the wait."}
{"text":"This place is lit. I got the Mexican Benedict and it was amazing! French toasts was really good as well! Avoid going on Sunday's if you want to be served faster"}
{"text":"This place has everything you could possibly want in a brunch spot. The staff is really friendly -like not just-doing-my-job nice, but genuinely-glad-you're-here nice. So nice, in fact that after we ordered our breakfast, they brought us an order of the pancake of the day because they thought we should try it. Normally, I'm not a sweets-for-breakfast lover but this pancake, peanut butter jelly time, was so delicious it basically restored my faith in humanity. That's not a gimmick statement, I actually felt that way after eating it. If I lived in this town, I would be here weekly, if not more."}
{"text":"I love this spot. The food is awesome and the service is unbeatable!!! Alex was one of the best servers I have ever had! Plus the patio is dog friendly.  The wait was about 50 minutes for Saturday brunch but it was worth it. You can get a drink at the bar while you wait. I love the adult hot cocoa options, plus you can play ping pong while waiting. We found a couple who was willing to play doubles to help pass the time. Fun times.  Alex had lots of suggestions, all of which were delicious.  He brought us some samples of the options we were trying to decide between.  I have tried all the Benedict options, I like them all. The stuffed french toast is really good if you are looking for something sweet. The oatmeal is good, but seems to be better during winter months. They change the recipe up a couple times a year pending what is in season at the time. I highly recommend waiting for a table during busy times,  it is well worth it."}
{"text":"We have been trying to come, being ASU territory it tends to be busy. Decided to come early, well worth it. The sandwich I am is mouth watering good, soft pretzel bun was perfect. My partner got the eggs Benedict, beyond pleased. Will be returning for another adventure in good eating."}
{"text":"I have now been to all the Snooze locations and enjoy their breakfast offerings. The pancakes are always sweet and delicious, and the bennies are very flavorful. I love the mix and match menu options for both pancakes and eggs benedict. That makes it easier for us. But this place is SO crowded. Plan on waiting up to 45 minutes on the weekend for sure. But hit them up - really fine breakfast goodies ... skip the hash browns though (they're kinda meh.)"}
{"text":"Your food is just as scrumptious here as at any of your other locations. I get that you're new and working out a few of the kinks. Let me help you... Dude at the welcome station wrote down my phone number for texting incorrectly - twice. So we waited an extra 15 minutes until someone else was smart enough to call out our name. Your servers are quite inattentive. I'd like my water refreshed, I'd like my coffee refreshed, I'd like someone to ask how I'm doing. Snap it up folks - good food calls me back, but inferior service sends me down the street."}
{"text":"Just as wonderful as your Denver location, but bigger. A good 20 minute wait early on a Saturday morning, which I thought was appropriate. Great hash browns, and that trio of pancakes cannot be beat. I tried the blueberry, the tropicalada, and the sweet potato pancakes. Unbelievable! And when your server says you can have breakfast any old way you want it, they mean it. D√©cor is kitschy and cute, the place is spanking clean too. Don't dilly-dally about, run and grab yourself some breakfast at Snooze."}
{"text":"A fun an unique menu that wasn't executed very well. A long (65 minute wait) left our family of five crammed into a 4 top. The Benedicts were well cooked but simply not that tasty. For a family of 5 the bill was $100ish. Could have gone to Denny's, Village Inn or Egg I Am and had a much better experience for a more reasonable price."}
{"text":"The wait is long during weekend brunch. The reason for my 3 star review is because of the staff at the front. When you check in, your number is given to the system. When they text you, the message says your table is almost ready which means to check back in with the staff. Well I didn't know that since the message didn't say to go to the front and check in and I received 5 that said your table is almost ready. When I finally approached the front, I had my dog with me and was told the table is ready but I would have to walk him around to the back. Then as i was waiting in the back, they gave my table away for me not being in the front where the girl can walk me back...needless to say, those girls were unapologetic contributed to nothing to help me and didn't work to solve my frustration. It was quite an ordeal. The food was great but I won't be returning to this location because of such awful personnel. Do what you're paid to do...which is give customers good service."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito (add bacon) was bomb.com. Would love to try be breakfast tacos. I'll be back again"}
{"text":"We had brunch here on a Friday morning. The menu looks great with lots of vegetarian options, which made the 1 hour long wait worth it. Also the location is great, so walking around the vicinity while we waited helped pass time.  They have a good selection of cocktails. I tried the spicy bloody mary and it was delicious. We then ordered the OMG french toast to share. It was great, not too heavy or sweet with fresh strawberries and salted caramel.   I then ordered the benny duo: benedict with soyrizo sans ham and the winter harvest benny. It was brought to me with meat in it, very disappointing-hence the lower star review. They did remove the item from my bill, but the mistake was off putting.   This is a great place for brunch, just be sure to check your meal before digging in."}
{"text":"I was staying at the hotel next door and came by to pick up breakfast before work. The waitress and waiter at the time were both really friendly - I asked for some recommendations and ended up ordering the eggs benedict, choosing two different kinds to try. The waitress also treated me to a blueberry pancake since it was my first time there, and she felt it was worth trying. It was way too much food for one meal, but the leftovers that afternoon were still pretty tasty. Overall, it definitely hit the spot for 1.5-2 meals."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast experience. Great patio, heaters, dog friendly (outside) wonderful music selection and friendly staff. What a great compliment to all the eateries that have recently opened in Tempe! The food has been wonderful! The hash browns are delish!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and Amazing food. Order the spring frittata if you get a chance, you wont be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Relaxed and retro-chic atmosphere. I had the ridiculously good Banana Nutella Situation. The fluffy brioche French toast made the ideal base for the extremely creamy and flavorful  banana and Nutella cream sauces. Toasted nuts and plantain chips balance out the sweetness and creaminess."}
{"text":"Great food and great service but long wait times and overpriced food! Waited 45 minutes for our table. I love the French toast neat and eggs. Next time I'll try the mimosas"}
{"text":"Snooze has locations all over.  I tired to go to the one in San Fran once and the line was down the street and on its way around the corner at 7:30 am and they don't open until 8am.  Needless to say we picked a different place to eat.  So when I passed by a location in Phoenix I was excited but I wanted bfast and it was dinner time so I filed it in my mental roller deck to come back. Needless to say the conference fed us EVERY MONRING and the food was good and plentiful so I never got over to the location I found.  Then the morning I was leaving I was starving and of course my conference was over and I didn't have time for bfast in the hotel.  I was going to stop at Star-Bee's but I needed gas so on-ward I went to do that before returning the car.  I pulled up bfast places and this place popped up on my way to the airport! PERFECT!  I stopped and noticed NO LINE so I parked and hopped out!  The place was full but still had seating.  To save some time I sat at the bar and was given a menu ASAP and asked what I wanted to drink.  The young lady working was SUPER NICE and had a few regulars sitting at her counter.  They knew about her and she knew and asked about them.  LOVE when that happens.    I perused the menu and eye-spied the pancake flight.  SCORE!  You get 3 pancakes and you can pick any flavors...NICE I can try a few!  I went with the sweet potato, blueberry and pineapple upside down pancakes.  OH BOY! I was excited to try these and fill up before having to head to the airport.  I also got one egg scrambled.  I chatted up a couple over customers that were also at another conference that week.  We agreed the heat and humidity in Phoenix is HORRID and there is no love lost with the thunder storms.    My food arrived and no time and I dove in teeth first.  I tired the pineapple upside down pan-CAKE!  OH MAN SOOO GOOD!  Little bits of pineapple in the pan-CAKE!  You really DIDN'T need the syrup.  The butter was some mix that was PREFECT with the pineapple and it was light.  Next I tried the sweet potato and OMG SUPER DELISH!  It had some cinnamon butter mix that is making me drool just thinking about how DELISH it was!  Again I didn't need the syrup at all!  PREFECT!  Last was the blueberry pancake and it was good but typical.  I should have went for another DIFFERENT pancake to DELIGHT my taste buds!    Eggs were light and fluffy and good and the coffee was ON POINT...HOT and FRESH!  Simply DELISH!  I will have to try the one near me in the OC.     PS you can also get French toast with the pancake flight but I went with all pancakes since they have several different flavors to select from!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The wait is well worth it every time!   Today Katie was our server and blew us away. We was very knowledgeable of the menu and anticipated our needs before we could even ask. The restaurant was very busy but she was alway attentive and super friendly! With both of us being in the industry this was very refreshing! Thank you Katie! We will make sure to request her every time!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! The I had the breakfast tacos and they were so filling and delicious. The wait staff was great. They were soooo busy but we didn't have to wait long for our food or drinks. It's a great place for families and a fun place for brunch!!"}
{"text":"Really delicious breakfast. Just so busy it takes forever to get seated. Other than the wait it was really good! I'll definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Tasty little spot, good for mimosa brunch.  If you're a fan of gourmet pancake combos, they have a lovely selection.  Chicken sausage, while sustainably and locally sourced (most of their ingredients are) did not quite hit the spot.  The menu needs pork sausage biscuits and gravy.  Their Benedict's were killer."}
{"text":"I enjoyed two cups of coffee and the front lobby ambience here this morning, for an hour, as I waited for my table and watched people who came in AFTER me get seated...before me.  (We'd requested a table for two, at the first available spot: inside, outside, at the bar....didn't care.)  We kept checking our text messages as we thought maybe we'd missed our text alert that our table was ready.  Nope, we hadn't missed anything.  Yet people were walking in and being taken right back because their party, by blind luck, happened to fit the correct size requirements for the table that was currently available.    I know I wasn't alone in my anger and confusion over why people who came in after me were being seated before me because I watched a steady stream of other waiting patrons walk up to check on what was going on with their table too.  This seating arrangement seems grossly unfair.  Did I mention that I did this for an hour before I finally got mad and left?  And the kicker?  When we finally told them to cancel our table and that we were leaving BOOM a table for 2 was suddenly available!  I was at the Snooze in downtown Denver two weeks ago where I enjoyed amazing food, stellar service and our party was seated in 15 minutes flat, with none of this seating stupidity.   Get your shit together, Snooze-Gilbert.  Honestly..."}
{"text":"They say ignorance is bliss, and in this case I'd like to stay blissfully ignorant about the caloric content of the bombdiggity Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes and hot, crispy Chilaquiles Benedict and hashbrowns that I had here for breakfast when I had brunch with my best friend a few weeks ago, mmmmkay?  Thanks."}
{"text":"Booooo longest wait time ever. Not worth it, too expensive and no salt. Na I'll skip it. Had the two versions of the eggs Benedict  (steak, beef)  and it was so vanilla. Mimosas were good (6 out of10)."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to enjoy a delicious brunch! My first experience with Snooze was in Denver a couple of years ago. Incredible! Since then, I've sought them out during my travels out West. My favorite thing on the menu is their B.E.A.T. Sandwich with avocado. It's fabulous! Their sweet potato pancakes are to die for and so is their French toast. Don't mind the wait! It's only proof of how good the food is. Service rocks, too!"}
{"text":"Complimentary coffee whole you wait. Excellent breakfast whole family had a lot of fun.   A bit pricey but not expensive. Service was really good even on a busy holiday weekend"}
{"text":"Took about an hr to get seated on a Sunday early afternoon. Not toooo surprised. Hostess was okay.   Waitress was nice, friendly, attentive.  The food was okay. Ordered two different eggs Benedict.  One was cold, the other kinda warm. My potatoes were kinda warm, not cold. She replaced the cold Benedict for me which was nice. Cinnamon roll pancake was good and came out hot.  It's been a few hours and now my stomach is upset. Hope it's not food poisoning.   Bloody marry was okay. Cold pressed coffee was good.   Very cute inside, fun menu.   Probably will not go back. Gave it three instead of two stars because the waitress was great."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong at Snooze.  The coffee is the best. Selection is great.  It is best to get a plate with several types of  pancakes.  The Snooze in San Diego area has hoola hoops and fun toys to play with outside.  That could be a fun addition to Valley of the sun"}
{"text":"Um, best breakfast ever. I hope I have one near me for the rest of my life.  I had the Benny Duo (?). The quinoa one rocked my world."}
{"text":"It's a really cool atmosphere to have breakfast in. The staff are all really friendly, and the decor/seating is unique in the best ways. The food was great. I got the pineapple upside down pancake. They were really big, enough for two mwals(there were 2 pancakes). The taste was good, but not as good as I was hoping though. My step-dad tried them and really liked them though, so it is really just individuals personal taste. I tried my mom's hash Browns and they were really good. Overall all three of us enjoyed our food and left as satisfied customers. It's a great place to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"95 minute wait for breakfast? Really? So here is the tip, go to the bar, but you might have to stand and eat. I did just that since I was solo. No wait, but not a great experience since people were trying to order drinks all around me. Did I mention I had to stand to eat?   The place plays very, very loud music. That is never a negative for me. I love music. If I think music is loud it is really loud. However, for a breakfast place it seemed strange. Don't go here with a hangover, migraine or if you do not like crowds. People were all over the place waiting to get in.   The coffee was not anything great but I have to admit the food was FAB! I got the sweet potato pancake and sausage links and it was seriously Delish!!!! It makes me sad because there are so many things I have heard are so good here. I want to go back but I probably wont. Well, maybe in the summer, on a beach holiday weekday?    *****Five stars for the food-and I rarely rank Breakfast food as a 5 star meal.   *1 for the wait and crowds  ****4 for the service. The staff members are kind and cheery. Definitely, not a Snooze;"}
{"text":"Lets me start with, Savannah is great.   My visit was spur of the moment, and selected based on best food photos lol. We ordered the pancake flight-- blueberry, french toast and pineapple upside down cake. Although we did ask for one plain pancake. So idk how that happened but score for us. We also ordered the breakfast pot pie w hash-browns. I was kind of sad that I saw the OJ coming from a container after I was already drinking mine.  I immediately dug into the pot pie, the gravy was more of a cool temperature. I had my friend try it too to make sure I wasn't being overly critical, or maybe gravy comes cool? Anyway Savannah came back a little later, I told her \"I think this is supposed to be warmer than this?\" She immediately said she would have them remake it. Round two came out and this time it was at least warm in some areas. My only suggestion is to make the gravy hotter or make it from scratch when its ordered. The pancakes and french toast were BOMB! I loved the blueberry the most.  Every employee said a parting greeting as well. I thought that was a really nice touch. Ill be back and this time I'm ordering the Chilaquiles."}
{"text":"If you don't go to Snooze, you lose! Amazing unconventional versions of breakfast favorites. The breakfast tacos are fantastic tasting and 3 make for a big portion. The chipotle hollandaise sauce is an unexpected savory twist. The pancake varieties are all delicious. The corn beef hash is wonderful beyond words because the beef has a smoky BBQ flavor. Poblano peppers add flavor without excessive heat. The service is fast and friendly. Tip them well. They deserve it!  This is our favorite breakfast place in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Been here on their busy days, and not so busy days. Environment and atmosphere of the place is great, hostess was great and a couple waitresses were amazing at customer service. I wish i had gotten their names, unfortunately both times being here our server wasn't the best. Both occasions they were not attentive at all, didn't check up on us, except to take our order and give us our bill. The food is a hit or miss.. if im in the area ill most likely continue to eat here but i wouldnt drive out of my way to get breakfast/brunch here."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of breakfast food but oh man this place is amazing! Everything on their menu is great! I love that they have some delicious healthy options but honestly I can never go in without getting a pancake or two or three ;)  If you go on a weekend you can expect at least a 45 min wait but it's worth it! Service is always great!"}
{"text":"Great staff, fun atmosphere and fab food, what more could you ask for?!?  We took our kids on a Sunday morning and had a 40 minute wait. But that was okay, because there were a lot of fun places to snap pictures around College Street plus Snooze had cornhole! The gluten free pancakes were delish and we will be back for the breakfast tacos!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  From the moment we put our name  in (they text you when table is ready) to the time we left we had a great experience!  Their French toast was to die for! We also tried the quevos rancheros and it was amazing too.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"the apple juice is fresh and delicious. the service was great. first time here and you know i'll be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the most creative \"versions\" of Eggs Benedict. I had the Benny Goodman;  lox and cream cheese. Absolutely delicious. I wish I could give this new spot I just discovered 5 stars, however their drink menu and back bar need an overhaul. Friendly staff and good music!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Excellent menu choices!  The options on the pancake menu are enough to get your nom nom brain going.    Snooze is centrally located and easy to find.  The store front faces Camelback Rd.  There is a small out door patio for dining outside.  I love it that their brunch cocktail menu is extensive and creative!!!  With about 4 or 5 Bloody Mary options, a few Mimosas and a few others, their brunch cocktail choices are truly impressive.  Return Factor:100%"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in the east valley! It's ALWAYS packed and they don't take reservations. However, since the location is downtown you can easily pass the time at the farmers market on weekends or walk around and look at the cuteness of downtown. They will text you when your table is ready. The lattes and mochas are excellent, breakfast tacos (with flour tortillas, the corn falls apart easily) and all their pancakes are out of this world. Try the pancake flight so you can choose 3 different pancakes to try at once! You have to try this place at least once in your life!"}
{"text":"We discovered snooze while we were in San Diego but that's a different review. I was excited to see they had several AZ locations. We had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table - worth it.  The staff gave great service and the manager was a WONDER WOMAN!  (Kristin?) she was everywhere and still had the time to have a nice conversation with us about the history of snooze. We all had different meals and had to taste each other's because they were so delicious. This place is a must no matter what city you are in."}
{"text":"I enjoy this breakfast spot, but going on a weekend morning is pretty tortuous. It's super crowded and the wait is pretty long. If you happen to go on an off time the food it pretty good. I enjoy the benedicts, but he hashbrowns are a bit bland and soft. I think this place gets a lot more hype than it's really worth. If you want to try some interesting pancakes that are really decadent and sweet then you'd love this place. They have a bunch of dessert type pancakes to choose from and you can mix and match which is nice."}
