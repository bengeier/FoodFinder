{"text":"Just finished a delicious meal of pulled pork, brisket and ribs.  The meat was incredible and everything smelled so good.  I wanted to pull my car over and eat it all.  I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This is the best bar b que I've had in a long time. Their brisket is spot on. I recommend the 3 sliders and you can have chicken, brisket, and pork. Very yummy."}
{"text":"Tried HEK Yeah out because of their Groupon offer. I ordered their 4 Your Love combo with pulled chicken and pork, green chile mac and cheese, and cole slaw (and a bunch of slider buns). The pork was really tasty and smokey, but the real revelation was the chicken. Any time I get pulled chicken, it's either dry or bathed in liquid. This was neither. The chicken was in nice big chunks and stayed really tender. The sauces were nice and smokey--the original is pretty spicy, the ghost sauce is serious (but definitely gets the endorphins going), and the sweet sauce was great for the kids. 

The green chile mac and cheese was rich and tasty, but best served hot. As it cooled off, the cheese congealed a bit. For takeaway, I'd recommend a quick reheat. The cole slaw wasn't too flavorful by itself, but after the ghost sauce, it's coolness and sweetness shone. My family and I enjoyed our food, and I recommend HEK Yeah!"}
{"text":"The best BBQ in the valley. It's all about the mountain the sandwich in town. The price is on point with the quality of food. The best part is the service, very professional and easy going."}
{"text":"Not a fancy place but man is the bbq out of this world. Try the jalapeño mac and cheese as a side. Ribs are so tender they fall off the bone and melt in your mouth. You have to try it!!!"}
{"text":"Meh.  BBQ should not be bland; my pulled pork sandwich was. And lukewarm.  Hopefully it was a fluke; I won't be back."}
{"text":"Everything I put in my face here is delicious! Brisket, pulled pork, chicken, GREEN CHILI MAC AND CHEESE!!! (correct, I actually screamed that last menu item) 
Come eat here if you're within 50 miles and love a place with atmosphere, great food, and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Darn good potato salad. Best potato salad ever!  Onion rings were awesome too. Downside is that they were out of a lot things when we went in, like beans and chicken.  We had the pork which was good, The ribs were a little fatty though.  Barbecue sauce was good.  It's all a little on the spicy side so if you don't mind spicy barbecue.  Additionally,  they need a window cleaner and a couple big photos to detract from the paint color.  But I think this place has a great potential if they can keep it stocked so the customers are happy."}
{"text":"By far the best bbq in Phoenix. I've been here several times but what I've had is so good I've had trouble expanding to try it all. So far, the ribs are the best I've ever had and very smoky. The beans are awesome too. The brisket is fantastic. The fries are great and I don't eat fries usually.

What I don't like: the cole slaw seriously needs mayo. I can't eat it. The outside area has been cleaned up from just having old smokers lying around but isn't really a place that seems so inviting to hang out. The watermelon lemonade is really good but for my taste, needs less lemonade (which is probably not what everyone else would like. They do run out of certain foods if you show up later, so expect that.

Even with the negatives, it's still the best place to go anywhere in AZ that I've tried, and I've tried a lot."}
{"text":"We stopped into this place for dinner tonight and were super impressed! Everything is made from scratch, fresh and delicious!  I ordered the smoked brisket and hubby ordered the pull pork. Both were delicious! I was especially impressed with their cole slaw as it was not your typical mayo based, bad for you disaster. Actually tasted very healthy!

We sat on the patio with our puppy and the owner gave her a smoked shoulder to chew. She devoured it! Wen we were leaving he brought her a big of frozen bones to take home! How nice!

We will be back! Had a yummy meal!"}
{"text":"Ate here the other day. The owner was friendly and the atmosphere was very chill. Had a pulled pork sandwich with a side of baked beans and a jar of tea. Extremely good! Try a little of the Ghost BBQ sauce...WOW! ;)"}
{"text":"Came here with a person with Celiac disease. Everything is gluten free. The coleslaw is hearty and interesting . The iced tea is strong. The ribs are perfect. Service is slow, but staff is charming.  Worth the wait! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best bbq in AZ. I've tried places all around AZ and nothing comes close to how good this place is!"}
{"text":"Great bbq!! This is definitely one of my new favorite lunch and dinner spots. The brisket was great, nice and tender and fatty. The beans were awesome and the potato salad was wonderful! My kids enjoyed the rib plates and the Mac n cheese. Overall just great food and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"A definite hidden GEM!  Loved this place!  Owner and his wife there and run it.  All stuff made from scratch.  Uses the healthiest ingredients he can find and he will tell you them if you have any allergies.  Makes his own BBQ sauces.  
Had the special, a half beef and half pulled pork burger.  Fries were hand cut.  Awesomely seasoned.  Definitely worth your while to find this place as it's kind of in no-mans's land (Cave Creek south of Greenway).  But worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I think a better name for it would be Hek Meh BBQ. We went in hoping to support a local business and the entire experience was negative. Don't get me wrong, the owners are super nice people but that didn't make up for the rest of it. We food to go and it took close to 25 minutes to get our order. We got home and found out that they had forgotten the french fries so we called them. We offered to come back and get the fries and the owner insisted on delivering them. We didn't realize he would be delivering the old cold fries that apparently had been sitting on the counter since we left. We live less than 5 minutes from here so it wasn't a case of them getting cold on delivery. They did include a free dessert to try to make up for it which was nice but it was bland and completely forgettable. When we opened our meals, neither of us got our second meat in the platters we paid for. At that point we were kind of done with the whole thing and didn't bother to call as we didn't want more cold food. My review is not based on all of that--it is based strictly on the food quality. I found the barbecue to be average -- along the lines of Dickies. They offer a regular barbecue sauce and a spicy barbecue sauce. I couldn't tell the difference except the heat from one was more on your tongue than the other which hit you more in the back of your throat. The green chili macaroni and cheese has a great flavor but the minute it is less than hot, it becomes glocky and gross in texture. The other sides were equally as unimpressive to our disappointment."}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but his ribs were better than mine.  We were in Phoenix on spring break and got take out.  The ribs were excellent.  The only downside is that he seems to work there alone.  But the food was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I feel like I visited a different restaurant than some of these other reviewers.  We visited Hek Yeah for the first time and were very overwhelmed and frankly confused by our meal. 

The service time was completely unacceptable.  We arrived at 5:55 p.m. on a Saturday and there were only three other tables of 2-4 people there.  We were told to take a seat but never given menus - we finally went and found some on our own. We got our food at 6:46 p.m. (I had decided if it wasn't there by 6:50 p.m., we were walking out).  I cannot understand why it took 50 minutes to prepare our meal.  I'd hate to visit at a time when this place is full.  I'm SO grateful I didn't bring my young kids with me, as the wait was ridiculous.

The food was flavorless and under seasoned.  We ordered a platter with all of the smoked meats, and while they were somewhat moist, they were utterly lacking in flavor.  Given that this place smells amazing from a mile away, I expected the meat to have a delicious, smoky flavor.  But it didn't even come close. None of it stood on its own.  I personally didn't care for either the \"sweet\" or the \"original\" BBQ sauce they offered, so perhaps that explains why my review is so different from many of the others.  If the meat was slathered in a barbecue sauce, maybe I wouldn't notice the lack of seasoning and flavor.  But given that I didn't enjoy the sauce, it made the meal almost inedible.  The potato salad WAS inedible and in desperate need of salt (there was none on our table), as was frankly everything they served.

The sausage is reminiscent of Italian sausage - it tasted strongly of fennel.  It may have been appropriate on a pile of spaghetti with a red sauce, but it was just weird on a platter of smoked meats.  Again, that smoky flavor I expected of barbecue was absent, and it clashed strongly with the barbecue sauce.

The mac and cheese was delicious, and the brisket was decent (my partner liked it more than I did), but everything else we ate was a complete failure.  The employees were very nice but offered no explanation or apology for the 50-minute wait for our meal, which makes me think it is standard. This was our first and last visit to Hek Yeah and in the future will enjoy our barbecue from Dickey's, Honey Bear's, or Naked BBQ."}
{"text":"Wow...these ribs are obviously a labor of love. Extremely meaty...super tender and moist. Great spice to the rub. This is a small store...your classic local spot and clearly the owners passionate. The ribs are 5 star...the only reason the whole rating is not 5 star is the fries, while perfectly seasoned and hand cut, were not crisp...onion rings and coleslaw were outstanding though. Will be one of my regular spots from now on"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place when we were in that neck of the woods. We've been back because the service (both times) was just plain nice and efficient. The food is yummy, great for the whole family."}
{"text":"We've been to Hek Yeah several times. Tonight's visit sealed the deal. We will never be back. If you're going to have your restaurant listed on a service lik GrubHub, you should probably have a working phone line (all circuits are busy now, call back later) and good communication with GrubHub. We ordered our food at 6:30, with a pickup time of 6:55-7:05. My husband arrived at 7:00 and the restaurant said they just received the order. The place was completely empty. He waited 30 minutes past our pickup time for the food to be done. No apologies. Then the kicker? Charged us .79 per little container of sauce. That's like making someone rent a fork. If I was dining in your restaurant instead of takeout, would you charge me for sauce? 

Crap service.

Never again. 

Tried to support the little guy, and did so at least 10 times. This is shabby."}
{"text":"Just the best in Phoenix.   Whether it was the rack of ribs, pulled pork or beef brisket falloff the bone tenderness and great smoked flavor.   The sides were exceptional.   We had the cole slaw, baked beans and a great sautéed cauliflower.  Each were memorable.   Everything is made in-house, including the barbecue sauces.  Kenny only uses the best ingredients;  no GMO, MSG, or other stuff you don't want in your food.   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is awesome but the delay is too long.  We waited 30 minutes from the time we ordered to get three BBQ sandwiches."}
{"text":"Best bbq place ever!! Great food and atmosphere. The owner is amazing and  makes amazing bbq! There's even gf options."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon and tried this place out. I went with my father. All i wanted was ribs so that was i received. My father ordered the meal. The sides he ordered they said they were sold out. Mind you it was 12:30 at lunch time  there were 4 women at another table. Not one customer came in for take out. I felt like we were lied too.

The ribs were enjoyable. As you are sitting and waiting there you can smell the cooker. Love that smell. 

Food was good. Gave it 3 rating because we were lied too."}
{"text":"Had the chance to stop here for lunch today. The owner is very cool and showed me the goods cooking in the kitchen. I felt like Guy from the food network! Everything was fresh and the beef brisket sandwich was delicious! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I read a number of reviews before trying it out.  We called in the order, and were told it would be ready in 35 minutes.  We arrived at the appointed time, and were told that their computers were down and they weren't getting the orders in a timely fashion.  Well, that didn't apply to our order... I had called it in and talked to the owner himself.  Didn't make any sense, but oh well.  They asked us to sit and wait, and offered to bring us water.
The water never came.  The waitress (co-owner?) passed right by us numerous times, and never brought us anything to drink.  This is summer in Phoenix!  We waited over another half hour until our order was finally ready.  They were very busy, just two people, clearly overwhelmed.  
The prices here are quite high.  But we knew that going in, and were willing to give them a shot.  
When our order was finally ready, the owner asked the woman to throw a brownie into our bag.  It was a nice gesture, even though we don't do heavy sugar like that (it was tooth-achingly sweet)... but we did appreciate the thought.
The food was fine.  Decent ribs, nicely cooked.  Good potato salad, not overly seasoned.  Pretty ok fries.
But the next morning, when I looked at the credit card slip that my husband signed, I saw that they had overcharged us $2.00.  I sent them an email right away, and it has now been an entire week, and not a word from them.
I am a small business owner myself, in a customer-service oriented field, and I know that if I had received a note about problems like this, I would've been on it immediately with a response and an apology.  
To hear absolutely nothing from them speaks volumes.
I'm afraid we won't be back.  There is no point in paying high prices for merely OK food and terribly poor service.

UPDATE
As soon as this review posted, I did hear from the owner, who said that my email to him had gotten lost in a spam folder. And if course that can happen.
So at least I did get an apology, which is a nice thing.  And an offer to refund the $2.00 overcharge...which is not really necessary...shoot, it's just $2.00!  It's just that the overcharge on top of everything else was kind of a last straw at that time. 
I'm sure any place can have a bad night, and that there are other nights when things run perfectly!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place serves good food.  

We had the pork and the beef sandwiches, with a side of great beans and the veggie of the day.   We liked everything.  One thing I liked is the serving size of the sandwiches and sides are not so huge as a lot of BBQ places.  We got full, but didn't get overly stuffed trying to eat very large portions.  And the price is a little cheaper than the places that serve too much food. 

My one recommendation would be to serve fresh brewed ice tea, that's nice and clear, with a slice of lemon.

The owners, Kenny and his wife are friendly, nice people.  Kenny and I had several interesting conversations about barbecue, and how he likes to make it.

We will go back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  They have catered events for me also and people were hoarding the sauce because it was awesome.  Go for lunch, come back for dinner....if you arent still too full from lunch!!!!"}
{"text":"The BBQ can't be beat! Definitely the best I've had in the valley. I'm always astounded there isn't a line out the door with a huge wait. Instead, it's almost always quiet. I have to recommend the fancy fries.

I had to dock a star because one day we showed up around 11:30 or 12 on the weekend and it was all closed up (supposed to open at 11). It's pretty far out of our way so that was a disappointing wasted trip. Things happen and this may be unusual, but I won't be showing up before or even right at noon again."}
{"text":"The barbeque chicken, pork and brisket sliders are awesome...great flavor and not too saucy.  Get the barbeque beans as your side ...you will not be sorry!  The place lacks ambiance, but the food is terrific!"}
{"text":"Working my way through the menu and have found that everything is delicious!. I love the ribs and potato salad."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here about three months ago... The food was beyond amazing, ribs were perfect and the green chili Mac n cheese was amazing! We spoke with the owner and told him how delighted we were and we would tell everyone about this place and we did. A rare evening with no children and we both were excited to come here again. This time was totally different from the first... Our meat was so tough and the ribs were burnt. No silverware and I had to find the BBQ sauce.  After my wife asked for the owner... Who I saw.. She said he was to busy to talk to us. The waitress was useless and gave us attitude. We so want to believe it was an off night, however when the waiter \"Hollywood\" has a sleeveless shirt on and says.. I normally don't work here... You know there's a problem. Unfortunately, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great effort ... but it came up short.

What we liked: 
Locally owned ... nice folks trying to earn our business.
Smoke smelled divine outside while walking in.
Large mason jars for drinks.
Brisket was AMAZING!

What we didn't like:
Waiter felt more like a salesman than a waiter. I asked for a recommendation (having never been here before) and was shown the most expensive items on the menu and a detailed explanation why we should order them. Not interested.
Menu (printed and online) showed a lunch menu - but apparently that's only available Mon-Fri and today was Saturday. Shouldn't that be mentioned on the menu? 
Menu mentioned pulled brisket (pulled \"everything for that matter\") but that depends on other factors and may not be applicable. Our brisket was sliced. My thoughts: Don't put \"pulled\" on the menu if it's not \"pulled.\" 
Bacon cheese fries were soggy and less than desirable. Perhaps using real cheese would help?
Atmosphere was nice ... but cold. Not sure I wanted to take my jacket off while I was there."}
{"text":"I'm not buying these reviews. I RARELY bother reviewing places because I like to give a place the benefit of the doubt. Like, maybe it was an off night. However, I took 2 of my sons here for dinner tonight. The food itself was fine (brisket not great though). We got there at 5:20. They finally took our order at 5:40. We got our 2 meals (I shared with my youngest boy) at 6:30. There were 5 tables in total and this is the type of food that has to have been made already. There was a cook and 2 servers on a Saturday at dinner time. Since there weren't many people though, I still can't figure out what took so long. They didn't check on us once in the 50 minutes that we sat there, waiting on our food. There were only 2 sets of silverware so I actually went and got one. My son had to flag down someone to ask for more water. It was just not any ace I'd return to, especially considering it was $53 with tax and tip, and we had 2 meals and a small salad. Now, to be fair to the servers, they were kids, so I'm not really blaming them.  They were obviously inexperienced and I'm sure they have no control over the food prep time. There's too many decent barbecue joints in the area to waste your time here. One last thing....... At least 3 different people came in for carry out while we waited and they all appeared to leave unhappy. It looked like one wrong order and 2 that had to wait 20to 30 minutes for an order that was supposed to be ready."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of supporting local businesses so I've been eyeing this place since it opened.  We decided to try it tonight for dinner & we were not disappointed.  The ambiance is a bit lacking but the food & friendly service more than compensate for that!

We ordered 2 of the \"sampler\" meals: one had all the different meats & came with cornbread.  We added a side of coleslaw.  All of the meats were super tender & juicy, not too saucy.  The coleslaw is made mayo free & is not your typical slaw.  I wasn't a fan but my boyfriend loved it!  It has kale, broccoli, cabbage, etc.  The owner brought us samples of most of the sides to let us try before choosing.  The southwest creamed corn was one of my favs but I opted for the bbq beans & macaroni with my meal.  My platter was 2 ribs, 2 meats, 2 sides.  Both came with cornbread (with a twist).  It looks like the bread is baked into a loaf then sliced & grilled - so tasty!
My son ordered the rib kids meal with fries.  All kids meals are served with an organic all natural juice pouch.

The prices are in line with your typical bbq joint but I'm most impressed that the food is homemade.  

We had a chance to chat with the owner & he shared a bit of his vision with us.  He said he's trying to create something unique in the area to break up the monotony of burgers, Mexican, and pizza available while keeping in mind food allergies that have become more & more common.  The rubs/spices are MSG free & the sauce is made with brown sugar, no corn syrup or colorings.

Overall we really enjoyed this place & will definitely be back!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"In the area from Northern California and wanted a good BBQ.  Not familiar with the area, did a quick Google check and found this spot. I look for local places when I travel as they tend to be pretty good and this was no exception.   Had the 1 meat plate which was the perfect serving size for a late dinner; pulled brisket with cole-slaw & bbq beans.  Meat done just right (delicious), cole-slaw uniquely constructed with kale, broccoli, and pumpkin seeds along with the usual ingredients (delicious) and the beans were as good as any I've had (delicious) ... definitely made in house.  The owner was very friendly and you could tell that this is his passion.

If you want fancy decor and standard fare, this is not your place.  This is for folks who enjoy good, quality food created pretty much from scratch, a friendly vibe, and a reasonable price.  I'll be back when I am in town."}
{"text":"Hek Yeah's brisket is where its at!

 It's moist, smokey, super tender, and has sensational flavor! Especially when you get an end piece. All the seasonings and the smokiness collect at the end, and your mouth is lit up with a flavor explosion. My husband and I can't get enough of it. 
Hek Yeah barbecue is your go to place for outstanding brisket!"}
{"text":"HEK NO! Don't go! It took over 45 minutes to get subpar bbq. It would have taken less time to drive to little miss bbq for a much better meal. Save your time and your money."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped by here today for lunch.  I usually go to Rudy's or Joes real bbq in the east valley, but recently moved to N.  Phoenix.  I am a pretty avid BBQ lover and have tried some of the best all across the country.  I ordered the meat sampler, rib tips with 2 sides, mac and cheese and coleslaw.

I can't give this place any more than 2 stars and that's being generous.  The food was clearly BBQ from the day before,  Come on man, I know what old pull pork and ribs taste like.  The meat was tough and lacked the smoke flavor.  The sampler came out steaming as if it came right out of the microwave!!!!  The mac and cheese was good but wasnt worth 5 dollars and the 3 dollar coleslaw was a complete rip off.  3 dollars for couple of bites of coleslaw?  Come on man.

Overall, seemed like a good place for bbq, but day old bbq is something that I served.  I was not impressive and rather drive 45 minutes to Joe's or Rudy's for good BBQ.

{"text":"Best barbecue in Phoenix highly recommend pulled pork is the bomb. You can't go wrong so far everything is i have tried had been great."}
{"text":"Great smoked meats cooked to perfection.  The fries are freshly made and the coleslaw is in a class of its own.  The atmosphere is modest, friendly and unassuming with great tunes.   Definitely recommend this place.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you want to pay $10 for a tiny sandwich served on a hamburger bun, than this is the place for you. If you get it to go as i did, be ready for something else to eat an hour later. The meat was good, just not enough to warrent a price like that. The to go box had lots of empty space. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Wow. First time through and what a terrific treat. My wife and I are BBQ snobs having eaten this cuisine in spots like Texas, Memphis, South Carolina and Kenny is right up there. The racks were not quite ready so the owner apologizes and brings out a huge plate of home cut fries, a brisket sample and some of his pulled pork. Incredible. I'm glad to have found a great BBQ place in North Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"best BBQ I have had in my life!!!!!!! i have tried everything on the menu and I loved it all.....and gained 10 pounds"}
{"text":"First time here. Place is so unorganized both servers were terrible. Food took forever and there was know one in the place at 7:30pm. Server came out 2 different times to tell us that they couldn't fill our order. Needless to say we won't b back"}
{"text":"Average at best.  I like local places, I want to support family restaurants.  I've been here twice and tried 2 different meals.  Dry meat, the service is slow, and I felt most items were under seasoned.  I've had better, I've had worse."}
{"text":"Food was great and the meat was perfect. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was the portion size for the family meal was a bit small and we ran out if food and sides."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ. I have had the Green Chile Mac & Cheese several times since this place opened up. It used to be amazing and feel like a gourmet side. Now, it is OK, but you could replace it with a box of Kraft and it would hardly matter.

This last trip, the brisket was dry, but the hot links were pretty good"}
{"text":"I stopped in last Saturday afternoon about 3:30p.m. first time visiting this establishment. Was quite disappointed because they didn't have a half slab of baby back ribs waiter stated they were out. Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place based on the reviews posted on yelp. It looked like it would be a good place for some BBQ, and sure enough it was. To start the owner gave is a few samples of the sides to try out.  The BBQ beans and Cream orn were both excellent. I decided to go with the sampler for the main meal.  A wise choice on my part, being that every single meat product was on that plate of awesomeness. I also got 3 sides including BBQ Beans, Green Chile Mac and Fries. Don't worry people I had a few friends to assist in eating all the food. My compadres got a main dish themselves I'm sure of equal awesomeness. I would highly recommend this place to anyone because who doesn't love local flavor and good eats!  Thanks Hek Yeah BBQ!!! I will surely be back to explore other items from your menu."}
{"text":"The bbq, Mac and cheese and the bread pudding are very good. Hands down. I'm definitely coming back ."}
{"text":"Looking for a local spot and found this place. Food is great. Got the 1 of each slider combo so I could try all the diff meats. They have 3 homemade bbq sauces that are good also."}
{"text":"HEK yah! After one visit I am sold. The quality of the food and the overall  taste were fantastic. It was a hit with the whole family. The kids meals were a bit too spicy, but my guess is that you can ask for the fries, for example, to have less pepper. They even had a good gluten free bun for my pulled pork sandwich!! The service was excellent. Local, family owned flavor, as well."}
{"text":"The quick: great smokey dry rub BBQ. Outstanding and somewhat counterintuitive, healthy and very tasty sides.
All the meats have a deep smokey flavor, they are relatively lean and all the bbq sauce is on the side. The ribs were literally fall off the bone tender. Overall style is Texas hill country. One of the best of this style I have encountered anywhere in my travels.
If you are into sauced/vinegar styles from the Carolinas or Tenn this may not be for you but I would suggest you try it. They do have house bbq sauce which is good.
The sides are home made, very flavorful non-mayo based coleslaw, flavorful potato salad again very light on the \"sauce\" and baked beans that is more like a bean heavy chili.  Normally I am not a mac and cheese person but my wife was forced to fight me off as I ate a lot of hers.
Also, since this is a small operation, got a chance to talk with the owner/chef and the waitstaff. Very friendly enjoyable conversation. 
The one sort of negative: very bare hole-in-the-wall location and decor. Without prior friend recommendation, might not have ventured in. Be daring and take the chance.
Overall, an overlooked gem that we will be visiting frequently."}
{"text":"I love local owned and I love BBQ. How can you not try out a place called Hek Yeah?! I ordered online and my husband went to pick it up. We did the meat platter to try a little bit of everything. Plus added a large side of green chili Mac and Cheese and baked beans. Both sides were delicious. Honestly I can't remember the last time I've had baked beans that were that good. Not watery, not too thick, just right. The Mac n cheese was creamy. The smoked sausage and pulled pork were our favorites for the meats. Super nice family that owns the place as well!"}
{"text":"Really good BBQ!!! The BBQ beans and coleslaw were so good! Got to try the ghost BBQ sauce if you like spicy."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 minutes before closing, these guys still rocked it. the 4 stars is only because they were out of the brisket so they substituted with a different meat on my sandwich, and the chili cheese fries were well, not great (old fries maybe IDK). I will definitely be trying them again just earlier in the day."}
{"text":"Awesome beef brisket sandwich . Very good food and family feel . I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  Simply put...  Had the beef ribs, best I have ever had.  This WIIL be my go to BBQ joint."}
{"text":"I could not have been more disappointed. I bought the groupon which was for 2 separate visits. I'm going to give the 2nd one away to someone who pisses me off, because I wouldn't send a friend here. 

The food was mediocre. The brisket was no longer brisket but tri tip. And it was dry. 

But the worst part was the wait. We were there over 50 minutes before they brought us our food. After we had been there 45 minutes I contemplated leaving. I should have."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We just ordered some ribs and sausage for delivery for the first time and it was SO good that my husband was practically emotional and just called to tell them how good it was. We used to order ribs from pork on a fork about once a week and this is 100x better. I would explain further but I have to tend to my weeping husband who seems to be born again by the rib gods..."}
{"text":"Review of the food:  five stars
I'm a huge fan of barbecue.  My husband and I ordered pulled pork with beans and coleslaw for takeout.
All three items were delicious. Their beans and coleslaw are unique and yummy.
We used this company for a party of around 30 people.
They all raved about the food!"}
{"text":"As a transplanted Texan I've been looking for good BBQ for years!  At long last,  I've found it!  It's my new go to place!"}
{"text":"I have been to Hek Yeah numerous times and it is always good.  It is close to my home (obviously I live in a hole considering the rude comments made by other posters on the location).......funny cuz that hole is worth close to half a mil.  Anyway I digress -- all the food is homemade and fresh and tastes great.  I see a review by someone named Don which was very negative and actually pretty rude......odd because all he had to do was mention his displeasure to Kenny the owner who served him and he would have made it right.  I guess it is a lot easier to get on a review site and act like a little spoiled brat about it instead.  

If you want good authentic barbecue this is the place to go.  It is about the food here -- not the ambiance or location obviously.  People that have a stick up their butt about that should just stay away and hang out with all the other hipsters in whatever hole they crawl out of  (but not my hole).

Ribs are fall of the bone tender.  Nothing is overly sauced as it should be -- the meat should be good on it's own without coverage -- there is plenty to add including the oh so good oh so hot ghost pepper sauce.  All the sides are killer and if there is cobbler dive in.  The first time I visited here was after a visit to Austin Texas and this stuff is just as good if not better then all the places I visited in Texas and yes that includes Franklins.  So if you want some good Q hit up Hek Yeah!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork, brisket, mac 'n cheese, coleslaw:  all excellent.  3 bbq sauces were tasty and fun to mix.  Dining area could use some sprucing up for a 5th star.  Thanks for a delicious dinner."}
{"text":"Nice family owned restaurant! We had the pulled pork, tri tip, Mac n cheese, and potato salad. 

All tasted great and sauces were good...the sweet sauce was too sweet for us though. 

The wait was a bit long given they weren't busy."}
{"text":"I was pleased with their ribs, pulled pork, and potato salad.  But their beans were AWEOME!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how the ratings on this place are so high. I placed an order online and had the pickup time confirmed over text, but when I arrived the order was not ready and they didn't even have record of it. I ended up waiting even longer, and when I got back to work I found that they'd gotten the order wrong, anyways. The sandwich was cold and the meat was really bland. The \"handmade\" lemonade tasted packaged, as well. The beans were super tasty, but that was the only redeeming quality of the meal.  I might try it again as a sit down place, but never again ordering out."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ ever! I have never had Abby BBQ that comes close to this place, everyone here is super friendly and always make you feel at home"}
{"text":"We live close by and were hoping to love Hek Yeah. After our third visit tonight, we won't be returning. We ordered on the phone for pick up and when we arrived our order had been \"lost\" and we had to wait 20 minutes. When we walked in the door an employee was sitting on the counter with her back to the door and seemed downright annoyed to deal with us. Despite our long wait, we weren't comped and the total was just under $50 for a meal for two. Ouch. Now, it all would have been worth it if the food had been spectacular. However...it was average to below average. The meat was dry, the sides were bland and the bread was soggy. The food from Danky's BBQ (not far away) is FAR superior. Hek Yeah needs to work on customer service and stop serving dry meat. We are disappointed, to say the least."}
{"text":"Delicious food made with fresh, quality ingredients. Owners are pretty proud of their food, and for good reason! I had rib tips (which aren't on the menu but should be), baked beans and cole slaw."}
{"text":"Not only really good BBQ, but a FULL menu of AWESOME BBQ / western FOOD!! By 'food' i mean actual food, not all the chemical filled BS you get served everywhere else in this state. I talked to the owner for a few & he's a good guy. He is committed to serving natural & organic food that not only tastes AMAZING, but is actually good for your body as well. He picked this location not because it would be good for his pockets, but because the neighborhood he grew up in needs a healthy alternative. Healthy BBQ? YEP, and it's GLORIOUS!

I had the spicy pulled pork sandwich combo. The pork was amazing, the bun was perfect for that type of sandwich, & the fries were amazing too. VERY well seasoned. I also tired their lemonade. ...came out of the kitchen in a pitcher & tasted like my grandma made it. SO good! Service was very good too.

I read the reviews mentioning a lack of ambiance, and to be honest, it was a little plain inside. BUT, it was very clean & after trying their FOOD, I'm happy they put most of the effort in to their food. The tables are solid, the seating is not cramped, & there's plenty of room for large groups. For a start-up restaurant, he did it right. 

Go try their food, you'll be back again & again."}
{"text":"This place was really good! I had an urge for BBQ and found this place on Yelp. It is a smaller place that does a little more take out than dine in. I did a take out order. The menu is straight forward. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, add cole slaw with potato salad as a side. I also tried the fancy fries because I had seen pics on Yelp.  While I waited, I was offered a large mason jar filled with water. I got the smoked BBQ sauce, the original BBQ sauce and the ghost pepper BBQ sauce to take with me. I added the ghost pepper sauce to the fries to go with the spiciness. I definitely got a kick after the fact. Just like I got smoky effects after the fact too. Good food. Good service. They have gotten an A rating from inspections for all the years they have been around. Very consistent. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I was actually in last Tuesday for lunch. Thought I wrote a review but only checked in. 
Needed lunch and found this nice place on yelp. I had a pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw. The pork was served smoky hot & plain, in its own wonderful juices on a fresh, grilled roll. 3 different sauces were provided for do it yourself seasoning. Smoky BBQ, Sweet BBQ, and a BBQ sauce with ghost peppers in it. The coleslaw was beyond crisp. Actually crunchy and served cold. Very unique with cabbage, kale, and broccoli as just a few ingredients I could pick out. Overall, excellent food. Service was good. Decor was ok. Looked like they may have been in the middle of remodeling. I will return."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place as not only is the Q so good you really don't need sauce because of the spices and flavors contained in the rub, but we live just around the corner from it!  For the WIN!  The only problem with living so close to it is that we smell the smoker and the wonderful aromas that perfume the neighborhood, so we are reminded of it constantly (not a bad thing).  We usually share their \"You Can Have it All\" platter which we devour along with a jar of their excellent iced tea.  Deee-licious!!  Anyway, we find Kenny and Heather to be hard working people with a passion for BBQ and Hek Yeah it shows!"}
{"text":"This little hideaway BBQ place is THE best place to satisfy your BBQ craving! My boyfriend and I drive from Glendale just to eat here. All the meat is excellent, but when they run out for the day it's gone! That's what happens when everything is fresh and made from scratch. Try the different barbecue sauces, the original is my favorite! The green chili mac and cheese is to die for, I could eat a giant bowl of that and be happy. If you're from the south you know how sweet tea is supposed to taste and this place has it down. It's served to you in a huge mason jar! You guys... TRY THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"The owner was very personable and the service was great. We got the dinner for four and it was really good. We had pulled pork, pulled chicken, and sausage. It also came with a full rack of ribs. For sides we had coleslaw, green chili Mac, and potato salad. Every side was home made and great. We had their home brewed teas and everyone like those too. The sauces are spicy and tasty. Highly recommended. We have tons of left overs too!"}
{"text":"We ordered a family meal to go on our last night in Phoenix....I'm sorry we didn't find this place sooner. Ribs were off the hook...tender, juicy, fall-off-the-bone yumminess. Hot tip: original sauce has a little heat, too. Meats and their rubs were gluten-free. Will definitely go back when we find ourselves in Az again."}
{"text":"I've had every BBQ joint in AZ, and this place tops them all! Brisket is beyond tender, dry rub ribs fall off the bone and they have three different sauces you can choose from. Plus, their sides are truly unique and the price point on everything is great!"}
{"text":"Damn good. Today were set up at a small event at the cute mall right next to their location. I had a pulled pork sandwich. Pork was done perfectly and omg, their original bbq sauce; out of this world! I will be back for a proper visit.
And if the staff are always that friendly, for sure I've found bbq heaven."}
{"text":"Had the meat sampler and fresh squeezed endless lemonade. The food was delicious, staff friendly and prices affordable. The food tasted fresh and the homemade sauces were delicious. The cook came out occasionally and seemed to really care that everyone was enjoying the food. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ in Phoenix. Good prices, tasty meals, different flavors. I am no longer a meat eater, but my boyfriend is in love with this place. Easy place on the go, great staff, laid back environment. I suggest this to friends and family, probably not for vegetarians....."}
{"text":"Best whole in the wall BBQ in Phoenix!! Excellent customer service, bet Mac n cheese and sweet tea!"}
{"text":"Don't come here for the service or ambiance.  Come here if you want great flavors and really good bbq. The pulled pork is quite amazing and I'm not a pork fan. The beef brisket is really good but my favorite is all the sides. I love their green chili mac n cheese, baked beans, and coleslaw.  The coleslaw is not usual.  It has kale and raisins in it. Very good! The cons of this place is service can be slow and food can take a little longer to be served but this place is family owned and ran. So with a little patience in mind it's worth a trip to check out this hole in the wall bbq place!"}
{"text":"First time I came to HEK Yeah BBQ, I was up by PVCC when a massive craving for bbq hit me. And WOW did Hek yeah deliver. I went for the Have it All Sampler, which came with Pulled Pork, Pulled Chicken, Sliced Sausage, and Brisket. I was blown away by how tender and and flavorful the meats were even without any bbq sauce. Not to mention the fact the owner Kenny is truly passionate about his craft, and is always so friendly and willing to chat it up. 

Since that first visit in November I've been back over 10 times, and have tried a variety of meals. The Mountain sandwich is PHENOMENAL; the baby back ribs...the meat just falls right off the bone; the sides, I've yet to have one that wasn't on the same level; and to top it off Kenny always has some new insanely good dessert he's baked up in the back. Seriously, if he didn't have this BBQ thing down, he could easily open a bakery. Anyway, this may seem like I'm gushing, but if you're in the area (or heck even if you're not), this is a must try."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The staff was on point and pleasant, the price was cheap, and the food was to die for! I had the pulled pork and it was cooked to perfection! I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Todd H, wrote an excellent review of Kenny's place, and there's no way, I'm going to improve on it.  I've been driving by this place, for 6 years, and this past Friday, was the first time I could smell the delicious aroma, all the way out to Cave Creek Road.  I was heading South, and it just kinda reached out and did a Mark Harmon to me, only in the nostrils.  I drove another mile or so, before I did the U turn.  I was surprised to find it, quiet, when I walked in.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the potato salad, and the unending iced tea.  
     After I placed my order, I waited outside, on the patio, with the smoker.  My stomach was wondering if my throat had been slit.  The second I smelled the smoke, my stomach started growling.  When the waitress brought out my food, I was amazed.  Not only by the way the food tasted, but by how nice, she was.  I believe, she checked on me, no less than 3 or 4 times, while I ate, and, my ice tea, only got to half full.  And it was really good, sweet tea.  I would like to say, that I'll be there for all my lunches, but if I did, I'd be at 350 pounds, by the end of this year.  But, I will put this on our regular places to frequent. 
     I love little hole in the wall places, and this one doesn't fail to satisfy my inner cravings, for bar b que.  I'm glad, I stopped here, and I will tell, all of my friends.  You can't go wrong, by this place.  The owner, is a great guy, as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is right down the street from my house. Always meant to try it. Glad I did, the food was awesome! Best bbq. Support the local mom and pops and check it out! There was a wait at the tabke, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"First time here. Owner was friendly. Menu was small. BBQ was great. They have a ghost pepper sauce that lit my mouth on fire... Fancy fries were woooooahh good. They had pulled pork, cheese, BBQ sauce , and beans on them. Would come again"}
{"text":"I've had the slider samplers and the ribs. The creamy mac and beans are my favorite sides. The beans are very hardy, more like a sweet, meat chili than baked beans. The BBQ is all very good. Lots of smoke. And their ribs are St Louis style, fall off the bone, and have a nice bark from the dry rub. They have plenty of sauce if you want to wet it down. Prices are $10-$20 depending on how hungry you are. Parking is easy. The ambience is a bit lacking. Drab. It's always hot inside and there's usually a couple kids doing homework or playing on a computer looking bored as Hek."}
{"text":"We had Hek Yeah cater our Mothers Day dinner tonight. The food, brisket, Mac-n-cheese, beans and potato salad, was fantastic! Brisket was so tender, didn't need a knife, moist and delicious!"}
{"text":"This was VERY good barbecue!  We split the \"you can have it all\" so that we could try all the meats and everything is cooked perfectly.  All their meats are juicy, flavorful, and tender.  I highly recommend and will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Huge huge tip guys don't come here an hour before closing there is a big chance they won't have ribs or brisket or both. I came on a Friday a few hours before closing and they didn't have either I came back the next day they didn't have ribs but the owner managed to give me the last two that he had the servers handled it great making sure the owner knew that I wanted ribs and he had to manage to give me his last two. The service is great the girls are very nice. The food is very tasty they make their own BBQ sauce everything tastes home made very delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty bbq for sure, but the service was pretty slow (but did seem like they also had a catering gig at the same time).  Tender pork, good flavor and a sauce with gentle spice.  Good fries, the Mac and Cheese was just ok thou.  Good review on the coleslaw from table mate.  The sweet sauce seems to have more spice vs. their original.  We'll be back for sure to a nice family owned place."}
{"text":"I'm giving 1 star because the ribs were excellent and 1 star because they were friendly, otherwise, the place has serious issues.  A group of 3 of us went in just after 6 p.m. on a Thursday night and ordered the meal for 2 with ribs, pulled pork, mac n cheese and coleslaw.  There was one other table of people there and a couple of single people. Otherwise the place was empty.  We weren't served our food until 7 p.m.  Nearly 1 HOUR wait for food. I'm not sure if the pig was being butchered in back or what was going on.  Again, the ribs were great and fell off the bone.  The pulled pork had no flavor and was really fatty.  The cole slaw was flavorless.  The mac n cheese was meh. The cornbread was funky.  The original sauce is ok.  The sweet sauce has a funky taste to it.  The ghost sauce is great mixed in with the original.  I would be tempted to go back just for the ribs, and wouldn't eat anything else. But there is no way I would wait an hour for food when the restaurant is empty."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great spices on the meats. Sauce on the side with many house made sauces to choose from. Everything tasted fresh and housemade. Friendly staff and great ambience! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Called to find out about breakfast menu and woman was very rude. Thought about trying this place bc I work right down the street, but not now. Closed on Mondays???"}
{"text":"Very good brisket and pulled pork. You can tell the sides are made with quality ingredients. Really like the beans, they are mixed with black beans to give a unique flavor and texture. One of my top 2 BBQ places in the metro Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Food was great, I did the 3 ribs with meat brisket, bacon cheese fries with beans and sweet tea, the sweet tea is the best I've ever had, with a drink and tip it averaged out to 25 bucks per person, the seasons are reminiscent of Louisiana, the 3 barbecue sauces, sweet, ghost pepper and classic, the meats come seasoned with dry rub, you can add sauce to your taste"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their bacon cheese fries! They had a high chair which is a plus. I'm not personally a BBQ fan so I can't speak for that but the chicken they have for the salads is so good! The Mac and cheese is awesome, too. I love that the drinks come in huge mason jars."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for BBQ. The pulled pork is the best, and I love all their sauces. I also love the friendly staff and the reasonable prices. :)"}
{"text":"Wandered in about 30 mins before they closed and was greeted with a warm welcome and slow blues on the radio.  Felt immediately comfortable.  Add this place to the Cave Creek Rd list of \"divey on the outside and great food on the inside\" spots.  One guy running the show cooking, taking orders and answering the phone but he was friendly and welcoming.  Pulled chicken sandwich had a smokey flavor I didn't expect and it was very welcome.  Vegetable of the day was sauteed brussels sprouts with almond and bacon.  Killed 2 huge mason jar lemonades.  I want to give this place 4 1/2 stars.  Drawbacks - no lunch specials on the weekend; no beer menu (he told me he's working on the liquor license) but also not byob; weird hours - closed at 8 on Friday and Saturday night and closed Sunday at 4.  Those changes would probably make it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I had a good experience both times. The restaurant itself is small, and in a small strip mall. If you're not paying attention you will pass it by. The dining room is small, however both times that I have been there, finding a place to sit had not been an issue. I'm not a huge bbq fan, otherwise I'd probably be a regular customer. As of this review, they do not serve alcohol. They're working on their liquor license, but nothing yet. If I had to complain about something, it would be my experience with their cloth napkins of all things. On my last visit, my napkin had hair all over it. I'm sure that it was laundered, but besides the couple of long blond hairs, it looked like dog hair or something on it. The napkin is black, so the hair was obvious. That alone is not enough to deter me from returning. I think that the price is appropriate for the food that you get. The quality of the food and the attention that goes into it is evidence that the owner is truly passionate in what he does."}
{"text":"I have never been treated so poorly the owner was making a joke of my religion. This place thrives on religious discrimination. I was taunted and over charged, in addition to having my husband and I insulted directly by the owner Kenny. I ordered a chicken sandwich, was given a pork sandwich, and when I attempted to exchange the sandwich as it was their mistake, I was taunted for not eating pork even though I cannot consume it for religious reasons. I just wanted to be able to eat with my family and even offered to pay the difference in price but was told I had to pay the full price Again!"}
{"text":"Best bbq ive tasted in AZ so far. pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches were delicious."}
{"text":"We came in at 730 and they close at 8 (felt kind of bad but the husband had just gotten off of work) but we were still greeted with friendliness and a smile (thank you!!!).

My husband had the 2 meat/2 side platter with chicken and pulled pork (w/Mac and cheese/ beans), I had 1 meat/1 side with the brisket (w/potato salad and mac and cheese) and my little ones had a brisket sandwich/baked beans. Food was good - it wasn't \"blow me away\" good but it was some of the best we've had in The Valley. I do agree that some of it seemed warmed in the microwave but I chalked that up to us coming in so close to closing. The menu is not super extensive but it has all the basics. Mac and cheese was a hit with all of us, meat was tender, the tea was tasty, and the BBQ sauces were delish. 

The best thing about this place was the service - we felt welcomed from the minute we walked in until the minute we left. This, unfortunately, is not a typical experience when dining out in this area. 

We will definitely come back earlier in the day and try a few different items. We like supporting smaller businesses in the area and this is one worth checking out."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Phoenix a few blocks from Heck Yeah and we smoke our own meats regularly, but I'm also celiac and appreciate being able to grab food on the go that is safe and delicious. The owner was super friendly and explained that almost the entire menu is gluten-free so I've eaten there a few times. Though they have BBQ sauce, the meat itself rarely carries a smoke flavour and I believe it's usually steamed/slow cooked and finished in the smoker. I don't like adding sauce because of the messiness, so the meat I would describe as quality cuts, moist and fall-off-the-bone tender but not very flavourful. So as a celiac I'll take it, quality ingredients that are safe for me to eat, even if underwhelming (especially for the price). About half the time I've ordered they haven't had a vegetable and once my fries were obviously reheated and not cooked fresh (they do fresh cut fries that are usually amazing).

Last night we were just back from a long international trip and didn't have it in us to go grocery shopping and cook, so while my boyfriend isn't keen on Heck Yeah (see: no smoke flavour) it was certainly convenient & we were looking forward to it. They had beef ribs so he ordered those too, and asked how much was included for the $20 price. The lady helping him said three pounds then went in the back and came out and said actually, it was four pounds, so he ordered it.

Came home and I opened the packages and was like wtf, why did you only get one rib? The bone is huge but there was literally only a handful of meat, we weighed it and it was less than 3/4 of a pound, a far cry from 4. For $20 we thought surely there was a mistake and they forgot to give us the rest of it. Even with the bone it was nowhere near two pounds so it wasn't a matter of pre-cooking weight either.

We called and were pretty nice about it but explained we know our meats pretty well and was also told it would be four pounds of meat, so to get less than 3/4 lb for $20 was not cool. You can get a half rack of them at Russell's Smokehouse in Denver (a much better restaurant in a much more expensive city) for $25. Here's their menu: http://russellssmokehouse.com/menus/food.pdf

Here is the best part: the owner got on the phone and said he threw in some extra brisket. Well hello, he threw in some other meat because he knew good and well we were getting way too little meat. It wasn't much, 1/4 lb or something. Oy."}
{"text":"Had lunch there - got the pulled pork sandwich with beans as my side.
Pork was very tasty - used the 'classic' sauce with a few drops of 'ghost' sauce here and there to give it some kick.  The beans were also very good.  Chatted with Kenny (K in HEK) - cool guy - cool place - good food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Had the beef ribs special and it was awesome. The meat was literally falling off the bone. Also, the sweet tea was great! Super sweet just like in the South. The owner came out and talked with all of the customers. He had smoked some salmon and even brought some around for everyone to try."}
{"text":"Another great take out dinner from HEK Yeah. Love the brisket and their cole slaw is amazing! I'm so glad we live so close to your restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, no lines, quick and friendly service.  Got the 1 meat plate special that came with 2 sides for around $14, and was just the right amount to fill me up without being too heavy.

Beef Brisket:  gave 3 cuts, tender, but a tad bit dry and could have used more smokey flavor/taste to it (personally), however I mixed up the sweet with ghost sauce and it made everything taste great! (I'm a fan of spicy foods)

Jalapeno Mac & Cheese:  tasted great, wasn't too cheesy or saucy and had a mild hint of jalapeno, not too spicy (which is good b/c you can add more heat if you need)

Potato Salad:  Surprisingly light and refreshing, wasn't doused in mayo, had shredded carrots, and was a decent serving size.

Great food and service, will be worth revisiting again if in the area!"}
{"text":"Sometimes all you need is a gentle reminder. A quick picture on Facebook of pulled pork sandwich with slaw was all it took. I drove straight to HYB and indulged in the most wonderful blend of smokey and sweet with each bite.  Of course I stayed only with the sweet sauce."}
{"text":"The place looks divey which usually is very promising for a barbeque place.  The meat however is not seasoned very well and cooked a bit to the dry side.  The sauces were decent but none could stand by themselves (I mixed the house with the ghost pepper to achieve decent flavoring).  The sides were decent, however, again lacked enough seasoning.  This was pretty much across the board from cole slaw to macaroni and cheese.  The meat also lacked a smokey flavor which makes me wonder how exactly they cooked them."}
{"text":"We have been there twice now, and definitely won't be the last time.  We met the owner tonight, Kenny. What energetic and passionate guy!  You can tell he loves what he does and it shows in the BBQ he serves.   Todd and Terry's reviews speak the art of Kenny's BBQ.  This is our new spot in the valley for BBQ."}
{"text":"Still love it! No veggies on the menu today but don't forget to order the coleslaw or Mac n cheese! Nice day to sit outside and the patio is a bit more enclosed now, which is nice!"}
{"text":"Very good, I had the sampler sliders with cole slaw. Meat was tender and had a little kick to it. I will be going again."}
{"text":"great food friendly staff fancy fries are amaze balls"}
{"text":"Organic, homemade sides. Beautiful smoke rings on amazing juicy meat  
Loved the green chili Mac n cheese. 
Food is great with or without sauce. Of course they are homemade as well: original, sweet, or ghost."}
{"text":"Just went to this BBQ gem today! It's tucked away on cave creek but the food is quite delicious.

We had the pulled chicken and the pulled pork with the Cole slaw and green chili Mac n cheese.

The pulled chicken was juicy and the pulled pork had a nice smoke flavor. Paired nicely with their original bbq sauce and the ghost sauce, WOOOOOOO! The ghost sauce lingers and is nice for spicy lovers!

Cole slaw was original and great flavor and the Mac n cheese was solid as well! Came with many buns as well in case you want to make a sandwich!

Check this place out! Local BBQ joint that beats Dickey's  for sure! 

Owner was very social as well and had a nice conversation with him! Try this place out the next time you're craving BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for barbecue and exploring the area I recently moved to, and saw good reviews so decided to give it a shot! Walked in and it's a cute little mom pop type barbecue place. I felt really uneasy because the small blonde girl at the counter gave my friend and I the \"up down who are you, and I already don't like you\" look. Asked if we were dining in or carrying out and we said dining in. She sighed and said sit anywhere. We grabbed our own menus and she came over and said \"what do you want to drink\" and rolled her eyes and walked away. She comes back and says in the same attitude type voice: are you ready yet? And we said it was our first time in and we needed a minute, she rolls her eyes and walks away. Someone came in to order pick up and she's rolling he eyes as he is looking over the menu. Now I usually don't go into detail too much about bad service because I do work in the industry myself and know how that goes but this was insane. Finally when we order and she walks away and gives me a death glare as I hand her my menu, she snatches it. SNATCHES IT. Seriously chick? How do you even have a job. When our appetizer came out she tossed it on the table and said here you go. Cmon. If you're not a person who cares about the service you receive maybe this will be okay for you but personally, I go out for an experience or I'd order take out. If I'm spending over $40 for dinner, I should receive at least DECENT service, not feel like I'm a burden. Isn't this your job? Now before you think I'm someone who complains about everything, please reference my other reviews because when I get good service I will elaborate on how great it was. When service is sub par I'm still nice, but this was absolutely ridiculous. The only time this girl said \"you're welcome\" was when we said thanks for giving us the check. 

Now for the food because it's the reason I didn't give a one star. We started with the 3 meat sliders which features one pulled pork, brisquit and one chicken slider. You receive three different barbecue sauces that compliment the food nicely. The pulled pork was my favorite, super delicious very tender, very well prepared. Chicken is a close second! 
My friend and I both did a dinner plate with a half rack of ribs, and choice of two sides. I chose cheesy bacon fries and Mac & cheese, and she did coleslaw and Mac & cheese as well. The ribs were perfect. Done exactly the way barbecue should be done. Everything tasted so fresh, and the man that came out of the kitchen (not sure but owner or manager maybe?) was so nice and you could tell he really is passionate about what he does and you can taste that for real! 
We may be back, but only for takeout. No one should feel uncomfortable and hated the entire time they are dining out."}
{"text":"Very nice Young Lady Cashier.  Restaurant was Clean and my Order was accurate and packaged with care on a Saturday 4 PM order.   TO GO - Approx $22.00 for my 1 person order.  3 Meat with 2 Small Sides/1 Brownie/No Drink.  I selected Beef Brisket,  Pulled Pork with small 3 Bone Rib portion.   Meal was just OK as Meats on the very dry side. \" Fingers didnt get dirty\".   Macaconi & Cheese described with green chile.  Although I have a mild taste buds there was hardly any cheese and no green chile.  The second side was a Garden slaw.   The Cream Cheese Brownie was fresh.  I don't understand the Cream Cheese Brownie name unless it is blended  as one with the Brownie mixture.  Have the 2nd of 2 Certificate's remaining.  If 2nd visit is repeat I won't be in a hurry to return.    The 5 Star reviews must have come on a good day."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time or money on the ribs. They are absolutely repulsive.  The dry rub is flavorless and has an unpleasant texture. They are bones of fat. I dont even know where to buy ribs this bad at a store. I tried so hard to eat these, and couldnt stomach them. Trash. To the owners-if people tell you they are good, they are lying.  

The sliders are delicious though. I really enjoyed all three kinds that were on the sampler. 

Menu is small and very basic. Dont expect to be able to order all the awesome things you see pictures of on yelp. Majority are specials"}
{"text":"Met a couple of friends here tonight and was amazed. The brisket is the best I have ever had. It was very tender, not chewy or fatty, and cut perfectly. The St. Louis style ribs were fantastic too. I liked the green chile Mac n cheese as a side. Lived less than two miles away and had know idea this gem was here. I would recommend this as a must stop in North Phoenix, even though it looks like a dive from the placement."}
{"text":"Don't pay attention to the negative reviews. Everything here is from scratch, cooked t perfection and well priced for the portion."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! I had the half rack of ribs with coleslaw and mac/cheese. The rib meat was so tender it fell off the bone and the seasoning rub was so good!!!  

The coleslaw is definitely recommended based on the unique flare with sunflower seeds, kale and craisins mixed in with the shredded cabbage. 

My other half had the brisket sandwich along with a side of the coleslaw. The brisket was sliced, was very good and was complimented by the sweet sauce; the portion size was perfect. 

The prices are very fair, the flavor is great, the service is awesome...highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I brought the grandparents and the kids...food was great, and everyone was happy. Now our new go-to for BBQ. Happy food made by passionate owners with good, quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Stopped by HEK Yeah BBQ for a quick lunch on Saturday.  If you believe in supporting local businesses this is a good opportunity.  It is located in a strip mall on the West side of Cave Creek Road.  There is an area to eat outside and ample number of tables indoors.  Very eclectic decor.  Funky and unique.  I was greeted right away, by the owner it turned out.  He was very friendly and answered my questions.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with BBQ beans.  The owner delivered my lunch and we talked about BBQ varieties across the country.  Very nice guy.  The pulled pork was flavorful with just the right amount of smoke.  The beans were tasty with hint of peppers to give them some zing.  All in all, a good place for good quality BBQ at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I openly admit to being a bit of a BBQ snob. Having lived in the mid-west and south for 18 years has given me the opportunity to eat a lot of it, and I think I can consider myself knowledgable.
#1- when we walked in, we sat at a table that had wrapped silverware but the table itself was dirty and extremely sticky. Ugh.  For some reason, I could not understand WHY you gave out cloth napkins at a BBQ joint, but oh well. When I unwrapped my silverware, the napkin was coated in long silver hairs. So was my companions. The server gave us two clean napkins.
#2- out of sausage. Sigh. I know this happens, but darn.
#3- I ordered a half salad with my two meat plate and the server came back and said I could not have a regular salad. Caesar or pick another side. Uh.. ok. Caesar it is.
#4- Salad came out with my meal. It was spinach that seriously was the weediest looking stuff ever seen. None of the stems had been trimmed, almost no dressing, and it was covered heavily in so much parmesan you could not get through it. And I don't know where anyone would call this a \"caesar\" 
#5- I had brisket and pulled pork with french fries. Brisket was EXTREMELY tough. Flavour was good, but I know why they gave us serrated knives to cut with. Pulled pork was dry.  Sauces were acceptable, my friend really liked the kick from the ghost sauce.  The best thing on the plate was the french fries. Sigh.
#6- one server dropped off our bill, then a few minutes later, another came over to do the same. Communication not good, and she kind of bitched at him in front of us. Not professional.
 Overall. Meh. My friend was saying compared to other places locally, this was really pretty good. And all I could think was that's a sorry statement to BBQ.
Not really interested in trying again, unless it's maybe to give the sausage a chance. Lots of room for improvement here."}
{"text":"The food here is ridiculously good, it's amazing tasting home made bbq. The owner and chef is a serious expert at smoking meats and always has something new and mouth watering for us to try. We always purposefully sit right by the smoker to get the first peek and aromas of what's being smoked next! They also make awesome deserts, sides and have tasty sweet tea. Very friendly people here as well with great service. We brought our dogs and they let us sit on the patio, and they even gave us bones for the dogs. Great place all around, for sure a Phoenix gem, and just insanely tasty and true bbq."}
{"text":"The owner and I had a great conversation about smoking meat and living in Arizona. 

The smoked chicken I bought was seasoned adequately and smoked to perfection. I also had the col slaw which was fantastic. I also got the Mac and Cheese which was also very good.

The entire experience was great and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My brother-in-law and his wife moved out to this area of Phoenix and hadn't really explored the restaurant scene too much. We flew in for their housewarming and to meet the new addition to their family (a beautiful baby girl!), and of course left it all to Yelp to find us a good place to eat.

We were a big group - about 10 adults, plus two hungry kids ages 5-6 and a newborn baby. They were able to accommodate us in the outdoor patio seating. One of our party members is vegetarian, and surprisingly, they had a housemade sweet potato black bean veggie burger, and also seasonal veggies that could be ordered on the side. Yay for the accommodations all around!

Because they are using locally sourced, organic, seasonal vegetables, not everything was available to order family style. So, we ordered a small side of the brussel sprouts, and were unable to get french fries to share. (Even the potatoes are organic!)

Their most popular dishes, according to the chef, are the BBQ pork sandwiches, brisket, ribs, and for non-BBQ lovers the chicken is also a favorite. We ordered several of the recommended dishes, beans, cole slaw, potato salad... They have like, 4 kinds of BBQ sauces (some super spicy but sooooo packed with flavor!). Everything was delicious and came out quickly. The chef came out a few times and was very pleasant to chat with.

And in the end? 10 adults, 2 kids, and all that food... was $130. I'm pretty sure I've dropped that much cash for just a party of 3 in California. So 5 stars for the value to food!! Thanks for showing us Californians a good time in Phoenix! Enjoyed the food and highly recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"Ony reason for a 2 star today is I like the owner. BBQ was dry. All of it. Pork, beef and sausage. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my second time ordering takeout from here. Everything is so dang good I never know what meat to choose, so I always get alil of everything. ALL their food is so home cooked, mouth watering good!! I'm in LOVE with the sweet bbq sauce!! This place will remain my only bbq spot for my family and get together!! FREAKIN HEK YEAH GOOD!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Heather and Kenny always make me feel more than welcome. Anytime I'm with my friends I suggest this place, because it's never a disappointment. Food is always great. The place is a little hard to find and the building doesn't look like much... But I think it's because their more focused on the food ;) 
Give them a try... You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Went here today to pick up some lunch. The owner was very friendly and gave me some recommendations since I had never been before. I got the pulled pork, shredded chicken, BBQ beans, and green beans with slivered almonds. All of it was delicious. The beans had a nice kick to them. I definitely recommend this place because they are a family run business, and the food is great."}
{"text":"I can't stop thinking about this place since I left. Everything I tried was fantastic, I could not pick a favorite! I will be back very soon. Save room for bread pudding!"}
{"text":"Let me begin this review by saying that I am fairly new to Arizona, I rarely eat meat, I am EXTREMELY picky, and I expect a LOT from a BBQ place (it is extremely difficult for it to be up to my standards). That being said - Hek Yeah BBQ is the freaking BOMB!!!!! It is nowhere near my house so I rarely get to go there (maybe 5 or 6 times in the past year. The pulled pork is amazingly delicious, the potato salad is like nothing I have ever had before, the fries are incredible, and the last time I was in, the owner talked me into trying the brisket and I am so glad I did - it may be my new favorite meat."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have ever had and I am a BBQ connoisseur. This place will blow your taste buds off. Ribs are better than anywhere else. Brisket is better than anywhere else. Mac and cheese is better than anywhere else. Should I keep going? Beans are better than anywhere else. 

My only complaint is that when I call in an order or place an order for pickup, it is never ready. I always end up waiting 10-20 minutes once I arrive. The first time, I thought it was a simple mistake. The second time, I thought maybe I should give them 30 minutes notice instead of 20. By the third time, I noticed this is a pattern.

If they fix this, great. If not, I don't care. I will still be coming to hek yeah for all my BBQ needs."}
{"text":"They have good stuff, but they only deliver when it suits them I guess. Even when I've called in orders I've had to wait. I would eat there more often, but the wait isn't quite worth it."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!! Hands down the best BBQ I've had in Phoenix. Everything is fresh, made from local ingredients. Service is outstanding, so friendly!  You have to remember this is a family run business, and they knock it out of the park! Try the brisket, it's to die for!"}
{"text":"I have to say I really agree with Daren C.
4.25

I absolutely loved the staff. Excellent service. We were offered wait staff service, as I have just now discovered from perusing other reviews. 
The food was delicious, I tried the chicken and pulled pork with green chile Mac n cheese and cole slaw. Sweet and original were my sauces of choice, as the Ghost was too much heat for me. The Mac n cheese was so good, you could drink the sauce. I contained myself and dipped my bun in it instead, mmm! The cole slaw was even more impressive IMHO, because it had some additional crunchy veggies to it, like kale I think?! I greatly enjoyed the fun, colorful, more healthy take on a classic.

I don't know why Cave Creek rd is a fairly depressing stretch of pavement for so many miles. However, it's been one of my favorite streets to be humbled by my own prejudice, as I have found gem after gem on this crazy little winding road. Hek Yeah gets added right to the top of the list of favorite hole in the walls.

I do think inside could use a little sprucing up. I appreciate the low key, comforting vibe, but I think it's a little bare inside, and not as warm of an atmosphere as it should be to compliment the home cookin.

I look forward to returning soon and trying the brisket!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Pulled pork, Mac n cheese, cole slaw & lemonade - all super good. Super friendly service too. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have  Driven past this tiny barbecue place a 1000 times since it opened. I was at the mall with my friend, and he said he was craving barbecue.  I said, I've always wanted to go to that place called a hek yeah and he goes oh yeah I've seen that place. Do you wanna go try it he said, i feel like some some sliders. You think they got sliders?  I said, I'm pretty sure they do, and macaroni and cheese, all barbecue places have sliders,  and Mac and cheese. Sure enough, they did.  We got there about 4 o'clock on a Wednesday and there was only one other couple in there. When we were driving up to the place,  we weren't quite sure which little strip joint they were in,  and we could smell it, but we couldn't see it,  so we turned around and there it was.  We sat outside . We got the menu and sure enough sliders , mac ncheese, French fries,  fresh cut.  We ordered one slider of each, brisket, pulled pork, bbq chicken. I never ate the chicken slider, because two was enough for me, and I shared my fries. They were good,  but I should not have ordered them extra crispy. The sauce was delicious, the brisket was divine,  juicy perfect, tender. The owner looks familiar, and  man,  did he know his barbecue. I smoke barbecue too, and spent some time in Kansas City and ate plenty of barbecue, so I'm pretty partial. I'm going back,  that brisket was really good. And you gotta go to before I eat it all"}
{"text":"not sure why this kid is giving a bad review when YOU made the mistake on your order!!! If the food is already made then its not on the owner. you messed up! get over it and move on.. I have been going to this place for 3 years.. The owner is an amazing guy and always has accompanied any faults on his part, But if you :The customer: make a mistake on the order, then its on you buddy."}
{"text":"I am addicted to Hek Yeah BBQ .. eat here every chance I get! Seriously best BBQ in the state, always worth the wait. Love the succulent ribs that fall right off the bone, the pulled pork is always good and love love the mac and cheese! Oh and the service that is pretty good too ;) The owners are always friendly and entertaining! And if you have a sweet tooth they usually have something yummy whipped up in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many times, finally decided to try it out .Excellent BBQ, had the brisket delicious. Make sure you upgrade your side to the bacon cheese fries, homemade and tasty."}
{"text":"Kick ass BBQ spot! Awesome brisket and ribs were fall off the bone! Nice to see BBQ done right. I'll eat here again and again. 3 ribs and a choice of meat with two sides is a winner for me. It's around 17 bucks and it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Small business ran by a man who loves to cook. Food was great and prices average $10. Or less. Good service. He made his homemade green tea with mint!!! To die for. I have pics but haven't figured how to get them on here, it's been awhile since I've posted. The salad I had was great!! Forgot to mention in photos"}
{"text":"60 minutes to get a sandwich and some ribs with no reasonable explanation when there are only a couple of tables occupied is ridiculous. 1 acknowledgement from the waitress in that whole time. Terrible service, regardless if you've been the only server there all day."}
{"text":"First time here. Winner winner brisket dinner.  Tried all the meats. Delish. My biggest problem with most BBQ joints are that they pay little attention to the sides   Not an issue here.  Owner/chef Kenny has a fine dining background that comes thru in the extras.  Pot salad, beans, green chili Mac and even the iced tea were terrific.  I'm not only coming back but  I'm bringing my friends.  I may even have them cater our company Christmas party."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best BBQ I have ever had! I have been to BBQ competitions in several states! I inhaled the BBQ beans and Pulled Pork! I ate it so fast, that I'm surprised I didn't loose a finger. This is my new favorite place for BBQ! 

I actually found this restaurant on the Yelp app for Locations Near Me. What a great app Yelp! So many people raved about this BBQ place, so I had to see for myself. We were greeted by the owner, a really nice and outgoing guy. I was indecisive on what I should order, which is a normal thing for me, and a pain in the ass for anyone else. Everything on the menu looked so good and there were so many sides to choose from. The owner recognized my dilemma and brought out a sample of four different sides for me to try! This almost made it harder to make a decision! I would expect a restaurant with this quality of food to be in Scottsdale! We are lucky to have it in Phoenix!  I loved the way they took traditional BBQ and added a healthy and culinary twist to it! 

For the main course I had the Slider Sampler. My favorite was the pulled pork, second the beef brisket, but the pulled chicken seemed a little dry. I added a little of their BBQ sauce and it was back to awesome. I was a little piggy and got three sides with my sliders. My favorite was the BBQ Beans. I love that they included black beans in the mix. The Fresh Cut Fries were a huge size, no complaints there, however the fries were a bit greasy. I like them more crispy. I had the Green Chili Mac N' Cheese, which had a good mac n cheese flavor, but I could hardly taste the green chilies. Two of the samples the owner had me try were the Cole Slaw and the Potato Salad. Both were very yummy! The only reason I got fries and mac n cheese was for my boyfriend. Next time I am getting the cole slaw and potato salad. The cole slaw even had kale in it, which I love, and the potato salad was to die for! Keep in mind that I have a critics palate, so I can be picky. This restaurant is now on my list of favorites.  

The owner liked hearing my comments on the food and was open to new ideas and suggestions. I hope he reads my post, because I can see him making the menu items even better than they already are!   Hek Yeah I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! The homemade sauces were great but the meat stood on its own. The pulled pork was fantastic! The rub has just the right spice. The Mac & cheese is a yummy compliment to any meat choice. The kids loved the pulled chicken sliders which they dipped in the sweet sauce. The street tacos were great as well.  I highly recommend you give this joint a try. Hek yeah is my new goto for all things smoked. They obviously take pride in their flavor profiles. Winner, winner brisket dinner!"}
{"text":"4.25

Pros: 
good meat 
good flavor pork
good hand cut fries
good lemonade
sauces were good
awesome staff (family owned and run)


Cons: 
location is meh
size of pulled pork (meat)
the bun was meh
the price is a bit much

While I say the price was a bit much you def get quality over quantity here. The homemade aspect of everything they do shows."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time a few months ago and then back a few times since and looking forward to going again here soon. Some of the best barbecue I've had in a long time truly smoke their meat and excellent customer service. The owner even sat down and chatted with us for a few love this place highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try a new BBQ place using a Group-On certificate. They are fairly close to where I live and like to support local businesses. 

Its a nice sized place and not flashy. I come to places like this for food, not trying to show off to anyone and Hek Yeah is just fine in this area.

Had the combo with ribs and beef, and asked for some extra sausage on the side. The fries were excellent and you could tell they were fresh. Was going to eat half of everything and take the rest home for lunch the next day but when I had a bite of the ribs knew that this was not going to happen! The beef was great as well. Sausage was fine but I prefer the \"hot link\" style. Their beans were also very good. Next time need to try the cookies... 

Ended up having the excellent lunch then buying a whole rack of ribs to take home for tomorrow. so guess you can say I was sold on the place. The owners are great and even met another customer who made a video about the place. Kim you need to post that! Might even make you a bigger star than you are now!  :)

I will be back, no question on this! Well worth stopping in for some 'Q!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here numerous times, and the owner, Kenny always delivers!!
The meat is amazing with no sauce, however the choice of sauces are sure to please any palate! We had roasted cauliflower on our most recent visit, and it was the best we had ever eaten! Always a treat to have a meal at HEK Yeah BBQ!"}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly went there for the first time last night.  When you first step out of your car the amazing smoke smell is all around you.  They give you 4 different kinds of bbq sauces, just a warning the fire is really good and the heat sneek up on you. Their brisket was yummy not dry like other bbq places I have been. When I first got my sandwich I thought it would not be enough but was pleasantly surprised by how full I was. The only thing that I can say food wise that might come off in bad way, but is not, is that if they made a home made cheese sauce on  the bacon cheese fries they would have rocked even more."}
{"text":"Awesome smoked meats! Great service and friendly staff. Good portions for the prices."}
{"text":"Great Patio Dining!!!
Tucked away,  right off Cave Creek Rd between a local coral reef store and an auto detail shop...you will finally find some VERY GOOD BBQ in North Phoenix!! 

Atmosphere-
The first thing you are greeted with is the AROMATIC SMOKY SCENTED GOODNESS wafting from the smoker, yes that's right the owner/smoke master smokes his antibiotic & hormone free meat, right out front beckoning curious neighborhood customers. 

Genius, I say! Super, chill hang out spot. 

Service-
Friendly and accommodating server, who was prompt with the refills and super cool to my two kids. 

Food-
The nice thing about the meat, is that it was smoked to perfection. Tender with just the right amount of that hickory (or whatever type wood used) essence throughout. They give you 3 different bbq sauces at the table for your choosing, one that's sweet, one with a bit of tang & slight bit, and one super spicey. All great!!!
 Bringing the pork, chicken and brisket out sauce free definitely allows that woody flavor to shine through. (Meat is not smothered in sauce) 

**I had the sweet tea, slider sampler, potato salad and roasted cauliflower. Tea sweetened to perfection, sides were perfectly crisp and definitely fresh. Price a little more than my liking since most of the menu is a la carte on the weekends. Probably, because the owner uses hormone and antibiotic meat as much as they can."}
{"text":"My friend sent me the Yelp page for Hek Yeah and what do you know?  4.5 stars based on 51 reviews!  Damn impressive....or so it would seem.  Well, since I can't, for the life of me, find reasonable BBQ here in Phoenix off to Hek Yeah I go.  Fingers crossed.

I showed up at opening on a Saturday and was the first customer of the day.  I thought for a second that the restaurant was still closed because the lights were off and the chairs were still on the tables.  However, the neon \"Open\" sign was lit and the owner was there welcoming me in.  It looked like he arrived just minutes before me.  After turning on the lights, firing up the point-of-sale system and taking down the chairs, the owner talked me through a few items on the menu.  I ordered the 2 meat with ribs and 2 sides platter which rang up to about $21 with a drink.  I picked beef brisket and pulled pork for my meats.  Mac 'n' cheese and baked beans got the call for my sides.  I took a seat and waited for my order which did not take too long to come out.

APPEARANCE
The food came out on a sizzling metal platter.  Portion sizes were very generous and it also came with a bread roll.  The pork was pulled or shredded as expected, but so was the beef brisket which caught me a little off guard.  I guess I was expecting it to come out sliced which is always my preference.  Why?  Because when it is sliced it tells me two things:  1.  It was cooked properly. When brisket gets overcooked it becomes difficult to slice and you end up having to pull, chop, or shred it.; and 2.  It is a good quality piece of beef.  When you pull, chop or shred beef you can usually get away with using cheaper meat.  Often times, the shredded meat is tossed with fat drippings or sauce which compensates for poorer quality meat.  However, for the sake of this review, let's give the benefit of the doubt and chalk this presentation up to preference.  Many people choose to shred their brisket because that's how they like to do it for sandwiches or perhaps it was a \"slice the flat, chop the point\" type decision.  Food was hot and all appeared fine.

TASTE & TENDERNESS
To start, I went straight for the ribs.  Well, actually what I got was more the \"flap\" than actual ribs.  Either way, I pick them up by the bone and the meat literally fell off the bone.  Despite what Outback Steakhouse or Chili's commercials will lead you to believe, fall off the bone ribs are NOT GOOD.  This means that the meat was OVERCOOKED and the way this meat just fell apart leads me to believe that it was not cooked that day.  Tasting the meat confirmed this suspicion as it was practically disintegrating in my mouth and it also felt and looked like it was heated up in the microwave.  The pulled pork and beef brisket were equally flavorless and dry.  The bread was \"crusty\" on the outside, but not very warm on the inside.  On a positive note, I really liked the baked beans and the mac 'n' cheese.  They were cooked properly, seasoned well and tasted good.

To sum it up, I was very disappointed with the food.  I just paid $21 for overcooked, underseasoned, dry flavorless food.  On top of that, due to the taste and texture of the food, I highly suspect that the food was not fresh (read \"made the day BEFORE\").  Again, this is just my suspicion, but I look at it like this.....if the food was made fresh (i.e., that morning), but still tasted like it was made the day before and reheated then there are some other problems going on here that need to be addressed.  So, sorry Yelpers.  The hyperbole on Hek Yeah BBQ stops here.  If somebody asks me to join them for BBQ at this place my response will be, \"HEK NO!\""}
{"text":"Lots of great reviews here but I can not agree.  I ordered the Groupon for $40 worth of BBQ for $24.  Only to find after printing that you get two $20 certificates which require you to eat there twice. So we went in and ordered 3 half rack ribs with 2 sides each. This is $16.49 but not pricy for 1/2 rack and sides.  So the cooking method and sauces are fantastic but the pork choice was a very cheap selection. Each bone was tiny and 1 to 2 inches long.  Meat was filled with gristle, bone parts and fat.  I have never seen a cut like this.   Baked beans were great and the fries could have been but mine just had way too much seasoning.  The price would lead you to expect a nice restaurant but you get a run down strip mall.  I know they are trying and the sauce and cooking method were great.  But I was misled and that bothered me.  Now I just don't understand all of these great reviews.  So after Groupon it was $48 plus a $11 tip.  No way was this bbq worth that price.  If I did not have the Groupon I would have spent $79.  Yes definitely something fishy in these reviews."}
{"text":"Great service is what many reviews mention and they are correct. I had pork sandwich and beans and slaw. Slaw was unique and fantastic. Pork was smokey and delicious. Beans had bits of brisket and were good. A few observations about the Place: Brisket sells out. They are closed on Sunday's. The ghost sauce is as hot as they tell you.  Lunch menu only M-F. Sit on the patio enjoy the smoker smell."}
{"text":"Very well done BBQ!  Loved everything I had. BBQ beans, ribs, Mac n Cheese. I thought the sausage was the best. Really well seasoned and flavorful. I don't live close, but I'll be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"A great Yelp find!    Looking for some BBQ while in Scottsdale.  Went with a friend.  We both had the ribs.   I had fries with mine and she had cole slaw and beans. 

Ribs came out with no sauce no sauce on them, which was perfect.  After all, why hide the flavor with sauce.   Ribs had a nice rub on them and the meat just peeled off the bone.   Fries were good and I used them to try the various sauces which all had their unique flavors.

As another reported, the sweet tea was good also.   Unfortunately by the time we came to eat, all the desserts were sold out."}
{"text":"Love this place. Lucky enough to have found it. Great service and always the best quality of food!"}
{"text":"The BF and I stopped in here after seeing the ratings on yelp. We're from LA so aren't familiar with the area, but were very happy to have found this place. Had the pulled pork with cream of corn and cole slaw - both sides unconventional but very tasty! The original spice isn't very spicy at all, so don't know what that one reviewer is complaining about. 

The owner was super nice and friendly. Not only did he allow our dogs (a pit/lab and a retriever/lab) to hang out in the patio while we ate, he even was kind enough to give us some treats for them! Super friendly guy. Heard he's getting beer in the place soon too, so look out for that. And they do events! 

Will definitely be visiting again when I'm back on town."}
{"text":"I was gifted a Groupon and it is good for two visits. Thank goodness because the first time was delicious. I had never been there before and I was greeted by a younger gentleman working there as I walked in. After finding out I had not been there before he proceeded to show me the menu and go through the items and point out his personal favourites. I had $20 to spend with the Groupon, so he recommended I get the \"you can have it all\" sampler for $19.99. I got that and a side of BBQ beans. 

The sampler came with pulled pork, pulled chicken, beef brisket, and smoked sausage. They were all delicious with a really nice smoky flavour and the portions were plenty. I had lots left over. Their regular BBQ sauce is slightly spicy and they also gave me some habanero sauce and wow that was hot.

I am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I'm throughly disappointed with the ribs here. This place is supposed to specialize in Ribs and I honestly can't tell. The waitress was nice but these ribs weren't that great. I've had better at TGI Friday's. I find the reviews on this place misleading as hell. The fries certainly doesn't look appetizing. The sauce to my ribs were cold...Overall not coming back."}
{"text":"I just went here with the family for Father's Day. We got the pulled pork, which was juicy and great Smokey flavor. The ribs had an awesome chili rub on them, and the brisket was my favorite. They were super busy, but both waitresses were very attentive. I will be going back soon"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ in Phoenix.  Great little place with a cute patio.  The brisket is awesome!  Green chili mac and cheese is amazing - but it will put you to sleep.  The housemade sauces are fantastic.  I have been here a number of times now and have yet to be let down."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! The beans, brisket and ribs were awesome! The bacon cheese fries are excellent! The staff were friendly and talkative."}
{"text":"Delicious! Some of the best bbq I've had and I kinda consider myself a meat aficionado. Very fresh and high quality. French fries are delicious."}
{"text":"This isn't only the best BBQ in Phoenix but it's the best in customer service. Kenny the owner is the man ! I can't say enough good things about this place. Listen to the reviews and come try this food !! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I had Kenny cater a Super Bowl party for me.  I ordered the pulled pork and the pulled chicken.  Beans, mac n cheese and corn bread.  Everything was awesome!
The pork was especially great.
The beans and the cole slaw were like none I have ever tasted.  Just delicious!
Everyone at the party was blown away at how good everything was.
One minor thing...the rolls that come with the pulled meat are quite small.  Not a big deal and not enough to keep me away!
I would highly recommend this place and would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"First and foremost, these are just good people. We feel great supporting this family. But for as hard as they try to make you feel welcome, they do a better job on the food. In the words of my kids, \"awesome\".  On our last visit we ordered the family of 4 meal, which included a rack of ribs, pound of your choice of meat, two huge sides, rolls and container(s) of their homemade bbq sauce. Everything was amazing. For $3 dollars more we upgraded 1/2 of our meat to the brisket. The other half was pulled pork. To me who grew up in Oklahoma, this was true to form Texas bbq. All of the meat was juicy and delicious with an amazing rub that stood in its own. The beans had some heat and were packed with meat. We also ordered a side of their maple glazed Brussels sprouts. Sweet and yummy.  And they were extremely accommodating to our child's dairy allergy. You won't be disappointed with anything you order. This review wouldn't be complete without mentioning they picked strawberries out of the garden on the patio and gave them to my kids. Above and beyond nice."}
{"text":"Food takes quite a while to come out :\ 

small small portions for a bbq place and quite pricey. The similar place i have been to definitely crush this place in taste and quantity.

If you are craving bbq and don't want to go to a sit down place and you are in the area, sure why not. Support the mom and pops. But it isn't a first on my list."}
{"text":"HEK Yeah BBQ has been buried in our bookmarks for awhile now. Recently, they have popped up on a couple of \"Best Of\" lists when ranking BBQ in Phoenix. Hey, I'm happy for them!

The place is located just south of the 101 on Cave Creek Road in that area where all of those really old plazas are. It's small, smells wonderful, and was pretty full on the Friday night that we decided to dine here.

The server was very friendly, explaining the key differences between all of their scratch-made sauces and continuously checking up on us. But as for the BBQ itself being comparable to some of the more critically acclaimed options in Phoenix? Eh, I'm not so sure.

The pulled pork had a nice smoky flavoring to it, although my girlfriend wasn't really all that impressed with her sandwich in comparison to what we've had at other places. The meat being cold probably had something to do with this. Additionally, their sausage, which was also cold, was just so damned dry that I found myself wondering if it was just an off-day or if this was typical. Thankfully, the brisket was decent, being moist, fatty, and tender and on par with what you'd expect at most places. Plus, it was at least still warm. 

Sides were sort of a mixed bag. The fresh fries were spectacular, while the mac and cheese was more of that clumpy-style, that also steered more towards dry as opposed to creamy. Potato salad was standard fare. 

HEK Yeah is clearly doing something right. Looking around and listening, based on the way the owner was interacting with customers, a lot of diners were regulars. And it's always nice to see more BBQ places thriving in The Valley. But when I'm being served cold and dry meats, it immediately reminds me of why some BBQ places have long-lines and some don't.

Still, give them a try. Maybe your experience will be different than ours."}
{"text":"Hek yeah this place is 1 minute from my house. I just ate there and have to say the best pulled pork I've ever had. I ordered online and did take out. While I was there they had me try their Ghost Pepper sauce, fantastic. I also had the fries which were also very good. We definitely be returning and telling all my friends about it."}
{"text":"Great barbecue joint. Good old fashioned meat with homemade sauces that are pretty awesome. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Would be totally awesome if this place was actually open during lunch hours... it's a privilege to eat here because they're always closed! Seriously bizarre hours. 

Pulled pork is fantastic. Also the ghost pepper BBQ sauce is amazing. Pork belly is awesome too. 

The sides leave much to be desired. Mac and cheese is quite disappointing. Beans are basically a weak chili (neither a chili nor baked beans, just... what? Pick one.) 

Also they don't have fountain drinks. How does a restaurant in america survive without fountain drinks? I literally don't understand. 

This place would work much better as counter service instead of \"sit down\" style."}
{"text":"Stopped at this cute lil BBQ restaurant while I was out at my friends shop. Decided to try it as the pecan smoke lured me in. OMG I was totally blown away by how good the smoked brisket and beef rib was. Perfect smoked flavor and the mac and cheese was amazing. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves southern cooking."}
{"text":"I'm going to start this review by saying we cook killer BBQ at home and I've never had anything close to what we cook.. well besides Bootleggers.  I bought a groupon (shame on me..I know Groupons kill businesses but I did it.  I swear I said 5 hail marys afterwards).  I got a combo platter of brisket and pulled pork.  Meat was decent.  Loved that they make their own BBQ sauce however; I wish they had a different option other than their hot sauce which was insanely hot.. so hot that my husband who orders his food Thai hot could barely tolerate it.  We ordered the green chile mac and cheese which was pretty good.  Beans were just okay."}
{"text":"Just had the sampler plate and it was better than I expected. The smoke flavor is rich and all the way through the meat. The sauces are very good even the ghost sauce wasn't to hot to eat. It is a very quaint  place nothing fancy but very good food."}
{"text":"The BEST BBQ in the valley! We just had a 40 person catering order brought in and everyone is raving about the quality of food. The BEST potato salad, for sure!The owner, Kenny, personally delivered the order, too. Very courteous and polite guy! We will DEFINITELY be calling HEK Yeah again!!"}
{"text":"Great  BBQ! The pulled chicken was amazing! Very moist and tender. Their BBQ sauce is top notch. The ghost pepper sauce is pretty good, too, if you need more of a kick. My wife liked the chicken and she normally doesn't like BBQ chicken. Not an easy feat to achieve! I definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Food and service were both fantastic!  Hubby and I will be back.  Love that it's so close and don't have to drive all the way to Gilbert for great BBQ!  Had the pull pork, brisket, creamed corn and yummy Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Loved the food here! For once I was able to eat BBQ and not go into a food coma feeling disgusting with myself from heavy foods. This place has all non-hormone meat and local/organic produce. The food is not so heavy either. For instance the cole slaw has grape seed oil and kale in it instead of only cabbage, mayonnaise and other fatty ingredients. The slaw was light and refreshing. The BBQ beans had some black beans in there and the mac and cheese was not overloaded. Good quality ingredients gave a delicious meal that actually gave me energy instead of slowing me down. Yum!"}
{"text":"Myself, wife, and friends have been eating here for years. I eat here weekly.

The food is always fantastic, fresh, and made-to-order.

The very few reviews you see that are low - make sure you take a gander at the rest of their reviews as I am sure that would shed some light on their \"tastes.\"

If you like local, personable, great tasting food (with flavor!) then you need to eat here. I have tried just about every BBQ place in town (Pork on a Fork, Honey Bears, Thee Pitts Again, BobbyQ, Waldo's, etc) and HEK Yeah is far, far above them in terms of food quality and flavor. 

If you like bland food, cookie cutter food, and uninspired sides prepared by a corporate menu or someone who doesn't care about food and expect 2 second service afforded by crap out of a can - then you will hate this place.

If you like supporting a passionate family, preparing top notch food with honest good ingredients, flavor, and ever evolving recipes that takes enough time to know it is freshly prepared to order  - eat here.

I have literally eaten here hundreds of times, often with large groups of friends - and never once been disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered a smoked turkey for Thanksgiving and it was the best turkey we have ever had. I Highly recommend it. It was so easy, we just warmed it up for about an hour in the oven and it was ready to go. Everyone raved about it!"}
{"text":"I have had the best BBQ on earth - east bay,San Francisco (Oakland-San Pablo-etc). WARNING! if you are white, it may not be right!
I have had the misfortune of having to live in Phoenix for 17 years now. Worst food on the planet. I am only here for the money-once there, good riddance.
We have to call our motels resorts just to get people to visit.
Anyway, HEK Yeah (come on HELL Yeah or even F**K Yea) brought tears to my eyes! Good Lord, they deliver! Kenny and Heather you are great. I have had just about everything on the menu plus stuff that was not. I may never hear those fog horns again or hear quality music but HEK Yeah - well thank you for being the only place I will spend the money that is supposed to get me out of this hell hole!"}
{"text":"Very casual, very much a dive, warmer inside than outside @ 88 degrees, music playing in the background friendly staff, EXCELLENT BBQ and GREAT potato salad and fries! With that being said
3 pulled pork sandwiches, 3 sides, 3 drinks for 35.02 not including tip I'll let you decide?"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever put in my piehole!  I had the pulled pork sandwich and I didn't even bother with the sauces he brought to our table.  It was moist and JUICY and scrumptious.  I also had the cheesy bacon french fries, which were yummy and a little zingy.  My husband had ribs and they literally fell off the bone, also very moist and flavorful.  He also had the sausage which he said was *REALLY* good.  His sides were BBQ beans which he said were the best he's ever had and also had the green chile mac & cheese...and it was even better than MY OWN.  I could have seriously made a meal out of it and stole half of his.

It's just a little hole in the wall type of place, but the owner is SUPER nice and fun to talk to.  We can't wait to go back and try their cornbread, which they ran out of.  Apparently it's so yummy, that someone came in and bought two of the three loaves they made that day!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Phoenix! Friendly owners, excellent meats, sides and sauces with attention to detail. The desserts are perfect as well. This is a great BBQ establishment to support."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and really nice owner! Had the 2 Meats 2 Sides with pulled brisket and pulled pork. If you like spicy BBQ sauce, his is a special treat. Green Chili Mac N Cheese, cornbread, all amazing. The bacon cheese fries were a special treat."}
{"text":"Once again HEK Yeah totally exceeds my expectations as well as leave me well in BBQ bliss!!! If you haven't been here before you need to!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife is gluten free and the options are good, the French fries are bomb, the mac and cheese is great, I had the mountain sandwich it was good. Also the beans were god, the coleslaw was more like a salad didn't care for it.. otherwise not bad.."}
{"text":"I am a foodie, and this place ROCKS.. The sausage is killer the bbq sauce has a  little bite and is extremely flavorful. If you love BBQ you have to try this place out"}
{"text":"Awesome local bbq place. I had the bbq pork sandwich which was great. The fries and bbq sauce are amazing. If I lived here I'd definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Amazing. Definitely best of here. Ribs were epic, as was the pulled pork! The fries were fresh cut and the owner brought out some smoked salmon to try... AWESOME!"}
{"text":"If your looking for amazing BBQ than HEK YEAH BBQ is the place to go. You can tell the ownerS put there heartS in the food. It's so hard to say what's the best because it is all so GOOD!"}
{"text":"Loved: The interesting Cole Slaw and the potato saled.  Cool ingredients and a lighter dressing.

Liked:  The owner's attitude and the pride he clearly has in his food.  You can tell he is living out his dream.  The BBQ chicken and the Pulled Pork are in this category as well.

Room for Improvement:  They should add a third sauce that is less spicy than their regular sauce.  Good flavor just too hot to get a good amount on the meat to enjoy.  Also, it would be nice to see some meat options that arent shredded like sliced pork and brisket, or maybe a half chicken.  A cold beer would be nice too, so a liquor license would help.  Or maybe they could encourage brown bagging?"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in Phoenix.  I got the 3 sliders of pork, brisket and chicken and they were fantastic.  The sauces are wonderful as well. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I pass this place often and mostly because of the location I have never stopped, but we finally gave it a try tonight and was very pleased!  The food was excellent and very friendly service.  We had the pulled pork, ribs, beef brisket, green chili Mac n cheese and baked beans.  The price is about the same as places like Dickey's BBQ, but I was so happy to find this place uses high quality (organic, hormone free, etc. as often as possible), fresh ingredients.  On the outside I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was clean, modern and inviting on the inside :).  Looking forward to returning often!"}
{"text":"This place is okay kinda overpriced and over rated on yelp. I'm from Kansas where real BBQ comes from. This is more like southwestern backyard bbq.. Also I don't recommend the bland coleslaw or the baked beans that tasted like chili beans.

Good customer service but I think I'll pass this place up next time I'm craving real BBQ"}
{"text":"The barbecue was OK. But the service was horrible!   And you wonder why the restaurant empty. Fix your service issues and it will get busy."}
{"text":"Really awesome ribs!!! Fresh made and high quality! The place is a hole in the wall but the owner brings the food out to you! Bacon cheese fries will make you fantasize about them. ... I only gave 4 stars because Sundays are a crap shoot as to what items are available... But at least you know it's all fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best brisket I've ever had, and I grew up eating St. Louis style bbq, Carolina bbq, from the east coast and dirty south. I even bought a pound of brisket for the road."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of getting my hands on their ribs and coleslaw..of course it was pure pleasure. Their coleslaw stands out from the regular ones which feature a bunch of unexpected ingredients for me kale! And cranberry!?...

Ribs was nothing ordinary. Had twice from this joint and it didn't not disappoint me. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food but a little cold (climate, not service).  Food was good but not great."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed after all the great reviews.  Barbecue sauce, the key to all good barbecue, was very runny.  All 3 kinds.  Pulled chicken was awful, pork and brisket not too bad.  Did not like having black beans in my bbq beans and mac and cheese was not cheesy enough.  All side dishes came cold.  The homemade fries were excellent.  Unfortunately, I bought a 2 deal Groupon, so I have to go back (maybe), but I'd rather not."}
{"text":"We bought 5 pounds of pulled pork and 5 pounds of brisket for a party and they were wonderful!! We found this place because of good reviews and now we can't wait to eat there! They provided rolls (slider size) and 3 BBQ sauces - ghost, sweet, and original. All were yummy! Everyone at the party seemed to enjoy it and even with 30 people there was enough leftover for 2-3 meals. Perfect!!  Even reheated, the brisket was tender and moist (without adding sauce!!)"}
{"text":"Come here get some ghost pepper bbq sauce. Really good. Owner guy passion about good redneck food. Yum Yum."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Because a customer makes a mistake and would like it if you could correct it, you instead are rude and show no respect! The inside of your restaurant shows the true inside of your character."}
{"text":"Dude. 
The bbq sauce is TOPS! Mom and I stopped and had a perfectly cooked pork burger. Started with a BOMB caesar salad with the best homemade dressing and lots of parmesan. 5 star salad. My burger was  Topped with cheese and grilled onions and a fresh soft bun. Side o beans, flavored just right! Mom got a 1/2 rack of ribs and cole slaw that she loved!  

Go here. Support local and eat like a Queen (or king) thank youuuuu!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable barbecue restaurant, every thing I've had there is beyond delicious! Kenney is a great cook. From the pork chops to the brisket, Everything is top notch!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience yesterday . Stopped in for a menu about 4pm  asked if they were out of anything he said not yet but I only have a couple small pieces of brisket left . I left came home called at 530 to order a pick up and guess what out of brisket i said ok i will order something else , he says if you can wait i have brisket due out of smoker at 7pm we waited showed up about 715 the manage/owner Ken says brisket just came out brought me a sample and Oh my god it was amazing we got the 2 meat dinner 3 baby back ribs 3 nice slices of the brisket green Chile mac and cheese very creamy and great flavor not super spicy the meal also came with baked beans wow 3 kinds of bean great sauce and pieces of sausage and brisket highly recommend. we also got the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw on top pork was smoking and juicy slaw was crisp and not overly sauced. Ken was very friendly we are coming back for sure . oh don't forget to get their homemade BBQ sauce, original,sweet,and holy cow the ghost pepper will light you up . and he also did not charge us for the sides of BBQ sauce as I read in someones review"}
{"text":"I want so much to say something comparative about this place, like best barbecue in Phoenix, or Arizona or the Southwest.  But barbecue is an art form to me and that would be like saying a Rembrandt is better than a Renoir or a Picasso.  Each artist, and here I mean barbecue artist, has their own technique and style and there can be none that is the best.

Now, worst?  Heck yeah there can be worst and I've had plenty of it. Maybe that's why I'm so dialed in to the subtle, and sometimes not so subtle, differences that can make me drool when I encounter a masterpiece of barbecue.

We discovered this place while coming back from errands of a Friday night hungering for some good brisket. We almost went to another place we never heard of but we had just passed it and didn't want to backtrack during Friday night rush-hour traffic. The website had promise, not overinflated promises just some key things that made it sound good. One was that they often sell out. That's actually a good thing because it means they're not some huge national chain that has a ton of frozen meat sitting in a semi parked out back.

And trust me, Hek Yeah is about as far from being a national chain based in New York City as you can get.  I'm reviewing this without knowing anything about their backstory, like who owns it, where they came from, how they learned the art of smoking their meat, etc.  Those are all trivial when I've got a taste for brisket, just show me the meat.

We picked up a pound of it to take home where we had some nice Mac Cheese waiting (that's our Mac Cheese not theirs in the photo).  Just a pound of meat in a bag, that's all. Note that the stuff's not cheap, the pound was over $18, but who's counting?  While I believe it is the ultimate sacrilege to put anything on brisket, especially so-called BBQ sauce, I do like tasting what local joints make so we took a tiny sampler of three of their recommended ones.  The lady asked if we like spicy and the answer was affirmative, but holy cow, er, pig ... that stuff is hot enough to remove paint. But that's a good thing, what I'm saying is it's very, very good.

Kudos to them for mixing a nice balance of lean and fatty and burnt ends in the pound. The ratio was just right.

This is a place I honestly don't want to review for fear that next time I go the wait will be 6 hours. When we went we lucked out and there were just a few casual folks hanging around.  So let's make a deal here, I'm letting you in on the secret of Hek Yeah ONLY if you promise you won't go there the same time I do.  Which, considering how much I fell in love with it could be anytime between 10 AM and midnight 7-days a week."}
{"text":"Everything at Hek Yeah was delicious,  and the owner was very friendly.  My wife didn't even stop to put sauce on her rib tips,  and the Ghost sauce was for-real spicy.  Just moved here and I think we found our BBQ place!"}
{"text":"What I LOVED / FIVE stars:

The brisket! Amazing! MY FAVORITE thing on the menu!
The smoked chicken breast! Amazing!
The beans! Yummy!
The coleslaw! Unique and yummy!
The pork! It was standard pulled pork and smokey and yummy!

Three stars for the ribs although other people seem to love them.

The mac and cheese. Just not enough cheese for me. Add some more cheese sauce!!

We will be back because I LOVE BBQ and they deliver. This is not a fine dining establishment (kind of a hole in the wall), but you are supporting a young blossoming new business, and I am certain they will expand into a new and exciting location!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Nice owners. Service a bit slow, but worth the wait. Coleslaw outstanding, cornbread very good, and the links very good. Ask for mustard sauce. Came back and the place has improved. Loved the music, jazz, blues, and soul. The Caesar salad was exceptional and the half size was a great side. I requested half pound of brisket with melted cheese and grilled onions. WOW! Delicious. My wife went with the mountain and a side of slaw. Also very good. Guess what, they are still very slow. Anyway, we'll be back and happily."}
{"text":"We discovered this place when tasting BBQ at different places for a party.  One of the others was rated tops in Arizona supposedly.  Theirs was dry while Hek Yeah was moist and tasty.    We went back in to have lunch and place our party order just before xmas and was surprised they were closed until after xmas.  I knew they needed time to order meat for a large crowd, so was a worried because our party was Jan 3.  Went to their website and emailed them.  Heard back the next day and we were able to get our order placed.  I can say that our crowd of 60 raved about the BBQ.  No complaints.  This is the kind of neighborhood place that you hope stays around.   We have tried the pulled pork and chicken.  They also have gluten free buns if needed."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Absolutely wonderful food and even had gluten free bread. The fancy fries are a must have!"}
{"text":"Came into Phoenix late on New Year's Day and tried to find a place to eat at 7:30pm. Hek Yeah BBQ was open till 8p. Smelled great walking in. Owner was gracious and accommodating. Variety of sauces, meats and sides. Beans were delicious. Slaw was creative and tasty. Meats were sooooo tender. All around superb culinary experience."}
{"text":"My new favorite BBQ in phoenix. The sides put it over the competition. Really crunchy and very lightly dressed coleslaw and baked beans with texture and flavor."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic BBQ!

OK, I came here a few months ago and was holding the reviews for a bit secretly hiding this awesome place but it really should be mentioned.

I ordered the shredded beef brisket and put on the ghost pepper sauce and could not believe how good the food was.
I got beans on my side and I wasn't too impressed, but it didn't ruin the moment for me at all as I came in wanting good meat and got it.

The staff was funny, our group had some goofy banter and just really enjoyed being there.  I'm so coming back! I went to other BBQ places and this place has ruined it for me so this is now the only place on my list for BBQ."}
{"text":"Ok I'm still a fan of hole in the wall places . This place is not really , hole in the wall place . But if there a middle class hole in the wall place this would place would be it .. 
The food was freaking awesome !! 
My wife even like the pork ribs and beans . 
Let me say this , my wife hates pork ribs and beans . 
They have the ghost BBQ sauce , that is freaking HOT if you just keep eating it . 
I'm not a fan of BBQ rub , but this place is good with the rub . 
We will come back for sure .

Round 2 : dam good food ."}
{"text":"WOW what good BBQ..  I have had BBQ in Austin TX many times over the years but have never, up until now, found something as good in Phoenix.   It is a small place in a strip mall but from my experience the size of the building has nothing to do with the quality of good BBQ.   We have been there twice in the last 10 days and we will  definitely be going back.  If you love really good BBQ, this is the place to go!!  The service is really quick and caring too."}
{"text":"Just reviewed Dickeys BBQ close by and it was the worst BBQ I've had.  However,  Hek Ya is Great!  I've had BBQ from all over the country,  even in places like NC and KC which have unbelievable BBQ.  This ranked right up there.  I love this place and would have gone back again but the one downside is .... They close at 4pm on Sundays ....  EVEN DURING FOOTBALL SEASON!  

If you can eat here though ...  well worth it!"}
{"text":"Mmmm so excited to try to hole-in-the-wall so close to our house! We got the family style meal with chicken and mmmmm delicious!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a new BBQ place near our house and dined here recently.  While the ribs and brisket were delicious we found the sauces were fairly bland and had no \"pop\" of flavor.

While the servers were very pleasant, service was very slow.  Additionally my wife ordered the vegetable of the day which she was told was oven roasted carrots.  When they came they were 1/2 carrots and 1/2 red peppers and my wife cannot stand red peppers.  The servers did agree to replace it with another side dish but it took so long to come out to the table we were both already done eating.

We will probably keep looking for another BBQ place."}
{"text":"So at first impression the atmosphere of the place came off as they must be remodeling, but then it was clear they were giving a feeling of simplicity, but yes it's looks as though they ARE working on the place. All things aside from an atmosphere standpoint the Hek Yeah burger was great! The dripping goodness on the fingers only intensified the burger and the fries were seasoned with awesomeness. The mason jar drink was cool with selection of sodas from a can or bottle. 
They had no beans and ran out of lemons 
Side note: GET A BIGGER SIGN! We drove past it and it's covered by all the other road stuff."}
{"text":"Service here was really good.  The guy that worked here was very friendly and made small talk and explained their BBQ process.  They do make it fresh which is nice.  The meat was very tender and flavorful and their hot sauce is actually really spicy. Their sides didn't blow me away but I would eat here again.  It's a bit of a hole in the wall but good food."}
{"text":"First time here and my wife and I got take out. She placed the order and picked up our food. I got the brisket plate with Mac-n-Cheese & Beans. She ordered the pulled pork plate with coleslaw and bacon cheese fries. She said the staff were very friendly and courteous.

When the food got home things went downhill fast. Brisket was dry, so was the pork, sauce was okay. The cheese sauce for the Mac and fries looked like cheese wiz... The beans were very good.

The coleslaw was downright nasty I took one bite and I was done. My wife are a lot more and was sick all night. Work on hygiene and dating your food folks that was clearly past its prime. We ordered late so would have preferred being turned away to being served old food. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We drive by this place a couple of times per week and decided to stop by after reading the positive reviews on Yelp.   The owners of the restaurant are very nice people and told us their story.  The food is cooked fresh daily and they buy fresh, local ingredients.  We ordered the Pulled Chicken, Rib Tips, Cole Slaw, BBQ Beans, and Mac & Cheese to have dinner at home.  They allowed us to sample the BBQ Beans and Mac & Cheese.  WOW!  I must say, my wife, my daughter, and myself were pleasantly surprised by the taste!  They were awesome!  We arrived home and tasted the Pulled Chicken, Rib Tips, Cole Slaw and Corn Bread.  The seasoning and taste were really good.  This is some of the best BBQ we've had in a long time.  They gave us their special spread for the Corn Bread and it was very good.  We'll be eating here a couple of times per week!"}
{"text":"Really annoying when you plan your day to have a beef brisket lunch and the waitress tells you their out. Happened a few times now. When you can get BBQ it's great!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! It's a family run/owned (husband and wife) restaurant and I believe everything is organic and local. The pulled pork is superb!  It's super moist and has the perfect amount of BBQ sauce. I also tried the potato salad and green chile Mac which were awesome. The owners are very friendly and laid back. The place needs a major decor makeover as they have random tables and chairs and wall art they probably got from grandmas basement. This place could use some major marketing as I would hate for this place to fail. There aren't many place like this in north Phoenix let alone in the neighborhood of cave creek and greenway. Try this place and spread the word because this place is too good and the owners work too hard for this place to fail."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely dynamite!! Kenny the owner is extremely passionate about his meats and how everything tastes that comes out of his kitchen.  I love to see his passion for his food!  All of the food is delicious with the Beef Brisket and the Pulled Pork being standouts.  All three of his home made BBQ sauces are bomb! Not to mention he has the best fries in town!  The one downfall is that he has a tough time keeping the place staffed properly to service his customers.  Anyone out there in the restaurant industry looking to possibly relocate, should stop in and talk to him about possible employment."}
{"text":"Wow let me start with that !!!!! The ribs are amazing I mean tender juicy and the flavor really stand out. I've got to say that I will be back very soon. If  you want in on a quietly kept secret this is it. Don't let the outside fool ya because the fries the coleslaw and that delicious sweet tea are worth trying just once I promise you won't be disappointed. Please just give them a try."}
{"text":"Great food. This area needs more BBQ and this restaurant is gong to fill this need. Hubby and I both got pulled pork sandwiches. Sides were coleslaw, potato salad, beans, veggie of the day or green chili Mac and cheese. Family owned. Stop by and check it out."}
{"text":"The best bbq I have ever had! Hidden gem! I ordered the full meal the first time I went and couldn't eat the sides because I was so full from all the ribs! So tender falling off the bone!"}
{"text":"Just had the \"you can have it all\":
 brisket, sausage, pulled pork, chicken, ribs. Everything was on point. It was over a pound of amazing meat, probably more then one person should eat, but it was worth it. The bbq sauce was great. All three were awesome but the ghost was very spicy. Also the Mac and cheese was unique and very tasty. The beans were also very good. I would highly recommend giving this place a shot. The only staff I interacted with was the guy who took my order, I believe he was the owner, and he was extremely friendly and even gave me a delicious little brownie while I waited for my togo order."}
{"text":"Hek Yeah served the BEST brisket we have ever had. We have now been to 71 bbq joints around the country (including 7 in Phoenix, which I should rewrite a couple of after trying this place), so saying that should speak loudly--even though I haven't bothered to write enough reviews. I WILL get that done...someday. Taking the time to write this one is another sign of just how good this food was. Back to the brisket--the pecan smoke flavor was perfectly balanced and the seasoning of the meat was just the right amount to yield a tender, perfectly rendered piece of melty meat heaven! See my pic. The ribs were delicious as well. The dry rub they have created, as well as the cooking process, is top notch. These ribs were \"barked\" perfectly, yet still moist and tender. The pulled pork was very good by bbq standards, but paled in comparison to the brisket and ribs. The 3 sauces they serve are delicious and balanced as well (original, sweet, and ghost), although, to be honest, we really didn't eat sauce on this meat because it was THAT good! This is rare...to find meat good enough to stand on it's own. Sides were also tasty, but that's not why we go to a bbq joint. We had the potato salad and mac. The mac was cooked perfectly and was cellantini instead of elbow, so it wasn't mushy and oily, just cheesy and tasty. The potato salad is chunky and unique. Yum. This is the real deal. They offer creative and unique desserts too...but we couldn't try them this time, as you can tell from the portion sizes in my pics. We had great service and pleasant experience all around. We will be back for sure...that brisket is whispering my name..."}
{"text":"Tried HEK Yeah for the first time today, and I'm REALLY glad I did. Excellent pulled pork sandwich, coleslaw was very tasty, and the owner was super friendly...even brought out a few tastes of some other creations he was working on in the kitchen ( all excellent, btw).
Loved the 3 varieties of sauce ( allowing a \"mix match\" approach..blend sweet/spicy to taste).

One big plus: the actual meat was ALL good. Not one bite of anything that wasn't tender and tasty. That ends up being the dividing line between \"meh, ok\" and \" I'll come back again\".

Great food, nice family vibe with the owners, not a fancy decor but friendly and relaxed. But at the end of the day..it's the food, and it's VERY good :)"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all! I have no idea where these people were eating at that are giving 4 and 5 stars. It's dirty first of all, dead flies on the window ceil. The table was sticky and got even worst after she whipped it down. Completely over priced! Don't waste your time, your better at going to a chain like Dickeys to have okay bbq until we get a real bbq joint around here!"}
{"text":"Its a bit rickety inside and out. I showed up during lunch time on a weekday, and for some reason it took forever for the guy at the counter to pull his attention away from the (work-related) iPad and register and offer to answer questions/take an order.

But man, the flavor of the meat is fantastic. You can see the classic smoker on the porch, and it indeed helps make the somewhat \"meh\" overall experience pretty worthwhile. The sauces they give you are great flavor, and you can add as much or as little as you want. It's a little disappointing that it comes on what looks like a simple bun from Costco not toasted or anything. Price wasn't exactly expensive, but wasn't cheap either. I found it acceptable given the obvious quality of their meat."}
