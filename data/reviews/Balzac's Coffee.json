{"text":"Best chocolate chip cookie in the area. Coffee was good, better than Starbucks and hotter than most places."}
{"text":"This location is on the 2nd floor of the UP Express station platform (behind Mill St). I've always loved their drinks and desserts (although I'm not a coffee person). Also, this location is not as busy as other locations which is great! Got my iced cafe mocha and small coffee almost instantly. Another nice touch is that they sell Canadian/Ontario merchandises on the side which was design-y yet approachable to buy as souvenirs and gifts."}
{"text":"My matcha latte tasted like dirty tap water...as someone who drinks matcha and matcha lattes daily I was extremely disappointed. The service was excellent otherwise of course!"}
{"text":"Stopped here while picking up a friend at UP station. Sat with a good coffee and people watched for a little while!   Overall a good spot to grab a coffee while passing by union station, there is a separate entrance so you don't have to walk through the maze that is union station.  I found the coffee was very good, I asked for a medium blend and the woman serving was very helpful and recommended one she thought i may like.   One thing to be weary of if you're planning on sitting with your drink: people waiting for the station may randomly take a seat at your table as they wait for the train. I had 2 different people join me at my table which was a bit unexpected."}
{"text":"For all those like me, a good cup of coffee is badly needed first thing in the morning.  I was walking about in Union station when I accidentally found Balzac's at the UP direct train to Pearson.  At first I thought you couldnt get in there without a ticket... turns out ANYONE can get here!  Compared to the Timmy's and other offerings downstairs, this Balzacs have more interesting espresso drinks at a fair price.  Compared to the other Balzacs I've been to (Distillery), this one has a similar menu with ZERO waiting.  We walked in and we were greeted with a smile.  There is an open little seating area and it's a good way to grab a decent coffee before heading to Pearson.  I got their Roasted Almond Espresso drink... it was hard to choose as they had lots of interesting combinations.  This in particular didn't get the same artistic quality as Distillery but for the taste, it's similar.  The Roasted Almond is a touch sweet but nothing as cloying as Starbucks.  It's definitely a step above.  if I ever have to go to CN Tower, Ripleys, or Union, I'm taking a quite little stop here to grab a good coffee before running off to wherever I need to go.  I like Timmys for it's quaint Canadiana but I love better coffee @ Balzac's more."}
{"text":"Service was nice but my Americano with an extra shot in a large cup tasted like a weak Keurig coffee. Worst $5.25 I've ever spent! At least with Starbucks you know what you are going to get."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the platform area of UP Express.   Best place to pick up a drink before getting on the train to the Airport. Seating is limited but most people seems to have it to go. I was never there during rush hour so there was never a wait for anything.  This Balzac's Coffee location is good also to stop by while walking from or to Union Station to CN Tower/Metro Convention Centre. I usually make this my pit stop whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"Balzac's Coffee Roasters is located on the platform at the UP Express. They have plenty of coffee options to choose from, including a number of delicious-looking sweets. Seriously, every time I'm there I am always eyeing the sweets. Coffee is made quickly, unless the train just arrived and there's a lineup. I usually order a mocha, which comes out kind of mild. Wifi is free, but you have to log in with your Facbeook account, which is annoying. There are a few two-person tables nearby if you're waiting for a train."}
