{"text":"Delicious food, very affordable.
Good service and ambiance.

Recommend quesadilla w/ steak"}
{"text":"Awesome space upstairs overlooking Market Square! I enjoyed sitting in the window drinking Tres Generaciones tequila on the rocks with lime! They do charge for their chips and salsa... The salsa amazing, but the chips were a little heavy... I prefer corn tortilla chips.. They were so heavy they might have been flour.  My food was delicious.. I ordered an entree of mahi mahi that was prepared with a chipotle tomato sauce that had jalapeños and green olives in it. Sooo good. It was served with rice and avocado slices over lettuce. I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is awful. Bartender really couldn't handle the 8 people at the bar. And he messed up mine and the two men next to me orders. either way the food was great. Lots of tequila :) I'll be back,  only because I love mexican."}
{"text":"My wife & I visited Las Velas restaurant early on a blustery winter Saturday evening.  The crowd in the restaurant was sparse.  I'm sure the weather & the construction hurt the crowd. Fortunately, the food was first class.  We had an appetizer of tortilla chips & guacamole.  The tortilla chips were hot & crunchy and the guacamole was fresh & tasty with a hint of lime & fresh tomato chunks.  

My wife had a frozen Margarita; it was very good with just the right amount of tequila.  I had a Negra Modelo.  

Our entrees were prepared table side, flambé style.  I had the \"Mar y Tierra OK Maguey\", steak & shrimp grilled in lime/mesquite marinade with a creamy cilantro & avocado sauce.  The steak chunks & large shrimp were tender.  My wife had \"Carne Cambalache\", a steak chunks marinated in tequila and mesquite-lime vinaigrette that were finished table-side flambé style.  We both a side of potatoes that were seasoned with lemon or citrus and were quite good.  I had rice & black beans as sides.  My wife had a side of Rajas con crema, that were poblano pepper strips in a cream sauce.  They were excellent with just the right amount of heat/spice for me.  They were too hot for my wife's milder taste buds.

For desert we shared an order of Sopapillo.  It was vanilla ice cream drizzled with a chocolate sauce served with two fried tortillas dipped in cinnamon & sugar.  It was a fine finish to a good meal.

The servers were friendly & efficient.  The food was well prepared & presented and the portions were generous.  We plan to return for another meal.

We have visited a number of Mexican restaurants in the Pittsburgh area and I would rate this at the top.  Our other favorites are \"Patron\" in Wexford and \"Azul Bar Y Cantina\" in Leetsdale."}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican food I've had by any means, but this is Pittsburgh....At least there were real latinos working there and it's fun to hear Spanish. I liked the decor and people seemed to be having a good time. I would go again if someone invited me because they wanted to go, but I probably wouldn't suggest it if I were to invite someone to dinner."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in Market Square. The chilaquiles are delicious. It's fried nachos with a tomatillo sauce and sour cream. They are the best nachos I've had. The service can be a bit slow but the chips and dip are good enough that you don't notice."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican place I've been to in Pittsburgh! I was recommended this place by a good friend of mine in the industry. I had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, my girlfriend had the Tex Mex tacos with a Marg. Service was slightly slow, but the incredible food made up for it. I'd recommend to anyone. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had our monthly group dinner at Las Velas on Sunday, Dec. 8. The space was great, bright and clean. The staff was friendly and attentive. There was a Steeler's game on and plenty of TV screens gave everybody a perfect view of the game. It wasn't the reason of our outing but still was a nice touch to the overall experience. The presentation of food was great and my fajita salad with shrimp was just fabulous! The service could have been a bit faster but since we enjoyed our conversations and chips/salsa/guac we didn't really suffer :)
Overall, everybody was happy with the restaurant, service and food.
Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve one star. U get one just for the view if market square during light up festivities. 
First, waitress doesn't know the diff between the various salsas in the menu. Go ask the kitchen. 2nd, I order a small sangria she brings a large one puts it down and goes oh ya... U did want a small , takes mine away from me pours it in a small glass ???? Just give me the drink! customer service 101. 3rd, our food comes,  waitress's put it down and a few of us start eating when we realize it's the wrong food in front of the wrong person. Wrong meats etc. arghhh !  No one ever came back to ask how food was can I get u anything else,  nothing !  And as I was watching the waitress walking around with the big trays of food I also noticed her ponytail in the plates of food before it was served. Delicious. Also why must I pay for bad chips an salsa?  Why are they not standard?  Really?
Chick fil a has better service."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are well worth the $2.50; they're completely home-made and light and airy and yet dense and satisfying. Also delicious.

I had two carnitas tacos and I must say that they were the best carnitas I've had in my life. The pork was shredded and tender, marinated in a bewitching blend of spices and lime. I've never tasted pork with so much flavor. I highly recommend them!

The service was a bit frustrating. There were 4 people in the restaurant, my friend and I were 2 of them! Yet there was still a mistake on our order, the food took a bit longer than I thought it should have (we both ordered the carnitas tacos; how hard is it to assemble 4 tacos?) but once I tasted the food all of my complaints about the service floated away. The food was also hot and well-presented. The servers were nice enough and as long as they keep feeding me such flavorful, authentic food at such reasonable prices I'd let them kick me in the face.

But they wouldn't do that. They're nice.

Bottom line: Las Velas is worth a try. The carnitas are worth risking a concussion for."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday for lunch. Not a bad wait for market square. Only 15 mins for. Party of 5.

Service was poor and we got our food before we got our waters and drinks

Food was not so good. They even forgot one persons food and we finished before he got his food. 

This is basic Mexican food and nothing to rave about. 

Won't be back again."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a business trip. I  didn't expect much from a Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh, but I didn't expect the food to be lower grade than your elementary school cafeteria.

I ordered the Cancun burrito. The tortilla was too thick and not soft and thin like it should be. The shrimp was not deveined and the steak was mediocre. The burrito doesn't come with beans, so there's not much to work with besides steak and vein popping shrimp smothered in grossamole--which was below average as well. $12.99 haha heeeeelllll naw, would go for $6.99 tops and expected to be served in a shanty, hole in the wall eatery. 

Another neg was the time you spend waiting for the food, was with a group of 11 and it took 2.5 hours. Better to just dine on the chips and salsa, that's the only good part"}
{"text":"Whenever I talk about this place, I refer to it as \"Los Causus.\"

Overpriced not great food, poor service, not that fun of an atmosphere.

Don't bother going.  You're better off heading to Emiliano's in the South Side or to any local Mad Mex.  Actually, I think I've had better food at Taco Bell.  I've never been to a Chipotle.

I was part of a party of 8 that dined at Las Velas on a Saturday night.  It wasn't that busy, and we did have a reservation, but when we arrived on time, there was a lot of scrambling to get some tables together to accommodate our party.  

We got a server who appeared to be in training (as she had someone with her) but neither one of them seemed to understand English. 

They brought waters for everyone at the table, but only one basket of chips and one serving of salsa.  Again:  Party of 8.

I ordered a strawberry margarita with salt on the rim (I prefer salt, not sugar as most places typically do with fruity margaritas), a cup of \"Sopa Cancun,\" and a chicken quesadilla without any onions.  I tried really hard not to be a jerk about it, but I made sure I pointed to what I was ordering on the menu as I was ordering so I could be understood.

I got a regular margarita with salt, and when I told her I had ordered strawberry, the server who had set it in front of me replied: \"No,\" so I said: \"I wanted a strawberry margarita, I ordered a strawberry margarita,\" and she took it away and brought back a strawberry margarita.

The margarita was okay.  I've read other reviews raving about their margaritas and frankly, I don't get it.  

I received a BOWL of soup (I'd ordered a cup) which was below room temperature and basically looked like someone poured water over a half a cup of salsa and threw in 3 pieces of chicken and some rice, and while I was grateful my chicken quesadilla did not have onions as I had requested, it was cold.

Everyone in our party seemed excited to be with one another, so everyone ate, but no one seemed particularly impressed with anything they ate or drank.  I also noticed a lot of people passing drinks and plates back across the table to someone else, as the servers kept putting things down in front of the wrong people.

At least the bathrooms appeared clean and well-maintained."}
{"text":"I like my Veg combo over there!! its good to have a change from regular eating habit!!!!"}
{"text":"Las Velas' space on the second floor overlooking Market Square is among the best real estate on the square--great view, feels great especially when the weather is nice (they open great big windows when it's sunny).

The food, however, is another story. This is my third visit to this restaurant and probably my last. Although not of low quality--better than most Mexican restaurants I have visited in Pittsburgh and in SW Pennsylvania--this restaurant is by no means great, especially compared to others in downtown and around Market Square.

I had the burrito salad, a big disappointment. My greens and veggies were soaked in a salty and spicy sauce--yuck! It came with onions, mushrooms, bell peppers, black beans, chicken, and some kind of cheese sprinkled on top.

My advice: stay away!"}
{"text":"Love the chips and salsa! On the second story, a window seat provides a great view to see market square. The fajitas are delicious, definitely recommend this restaurant !"}
{"text":"This place gets a zero. Food is horrible, over priced and the staff is very rude and doesn't understand or speak English very well. I've never been to a place that tries to speak to you in a foreign language and then turns you and other customers away because they can't understand you. Do not waste your time or money on this establishment."}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side, but the food is absolutely amazing. Make sure you get some queso (the best in town) and a sangria."}
{"text":"Best and most authentic Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. Love the fried shrimp tacos and queso dip!!!"}
{"text":"Consistantly the best mexican food in the city. I have tried every other mexican joint and still nothing stacks up to Las Velas. My personal favorite is the fish tacos and the il cilantro. I try to make it out at least one every couple of months."}
{"text":"The toilet seat was broken so I almost fell into a towering pile of my own diarrhea. Great salsa. 

Las Velas? I say Las Shittas. Everything is deep fried and taste old and bad. Old beer, bad chips, bad meat. Had to wash my clothes after coming home because they smelled very bad."}
{"text":"Enjoyable happy hour. The little margaritas have a bit of a kick - yea! The beef tacos ($1) were savory and quite a nice bite for the price. Happy hour was the reconnaissance mission - we'll try a meal next."}
{"text":"We have been here twice in last couple months before Heinz Hall events.  First time (before Blue Man Group) was so slow we were up against it to make the performance on time.  Food was fine but hard to enjoy when you keep looking at your watch to see if you have enough time to finish.....no, not overly crowded but under-staffed.  \"Can I have a check...NOW?\"

Second visit before Foxworthy and Larry the Cable guy we allowed PLENTY of time  Twelve patrons in the restaurant and four staff on the floor....32 minutes from drink order to when food served....and if we weren't concerned about time we would have sent it back as it was 10 degrees above room temperature.

To get a check I approached a couple waiters who said, \"Oh they are...\",   I interrupted them; \"I need a check; go find who has it; we got a show to go to.\"

If you appreciate slow service and luke-warm food.....this is your place."}
{"text":"Pros: Chips, Guac, and Salsa

Cons: Average, uninspired entrees, and a customer unfriendly reservation policy. Even if you make a reservation and follow their rules on when exactly to arrive (11:45 AM) they won't seat you until all of your party arrives. This would be okay if there was room to sit or stand comfortably in the main part of the restaurant, but there's not. It was annoying to see other people without reservations seated while we were squashed against a wall. If we were offered seats at the bar right away, that would have been slightly better, but it didn't occur to anyone to do that until 10 minutes later and our full party had arrived. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"The greatest margarita menu I've ever seen. The strawberry cucumber was my favorite. I also tried the mango cayenne and basil agave. All are amazing! I will never go anywhere else for one. The food was great. Left full and happy. Definitely a place to try and enjoy! The service was attentive and food came out quick."}
{"text":"Went for lunch! Amazing - great service & great food.  Esp the chicken tortilla soup, YUM!"}
{"text":"I have lost hope in the possibility of finding excellent Mexican food in the burgh. I have given this place at least three shots to make it to the top of my list but  another Mexican joint just didn't cut it for me. The service has always been great and I wouldn't be surprised if the drinks are excellent but the food doesn't cut it for me. I'm not from Mexico but I want authentic Mexican food not some cheesy gloppy mess covered with guacamole. Or a flaming skewer of shrimp and beef??? I had the Mar y tierra which is apparently one of the house specialties I'm surprised that this is one of the dishes that the server told me was their most popular. The presentation of the flaming skewer is nothing less than cheesy. And then to top it off the shrimp and beef were COLD after all that. Will someone explain the physics of that fiasco to me. The decor is okay and location is in market square which stinks for parking. If I'm missing something here someone please set me straight but I can't say that I would ever recommend this place for even drinks."}
{"text":"As a self-proclaimed Mexican food addict, te quiero Las Velas! Yum! Yum! Yum!  Las Velas had been at the top of my \"To Try\" list for what seemed like eons, and I am happy to say I can finally check it off.  Not only was the food absolutely amazing, but the views of Market Square were fabulous as well.

What I really liked about this place was the selection.  Everything from traditional Mexican dishes to having your tacos made \"Tex-Mex\" style, allowing everyone in my party to eat within their own Mexican food comfort zone.  I ordered carnitas tacos. (Because I can't see carnitas on a menu and not order it.  It's just an impulse I have to live with.) They were everything I hoped and dreamed. Literally, I dream about these tacos. The pork was juicy and covered with fresh cilantro and lime, with just a hint of garlic  Ah, so good. 

The only draw back I can find with Las Velas is that the chips and salsa aren't free. Now, I grew up on the West Coast where paying for chips is almost unheard of, however I have noticed charging for these addicting crispy wonders is trend among Pittsburgh's Mexican restaurants. This is really a small complaint in my otherwise fantabulous first experience at Las Velas.  I will definitely be back to explore more of their great menu, chips or no chips!"}
{"text":"My highest recommendation to visit this reaustuarnt in market square for many reasons.... Excellent food quality, service, drinks and Beautiful view..."}
{"text":"The fast food slow service of Mexican food.  The tacos had gristle so hard that I almost broke a tooth.  The tamales barely had any meat in them.  Black beans were good.  Cheap prices if you are on a budget.   If good food is what you are looking for, go spend your $$ somewhere else.   If you are on a budget, taco bell is better."}
{"text":"I went to Las Velas last Sunday which was the day of The Pride parade as well as the last day for the Arts Festival and all of downtown was pretty crazy. We decided to eat here and it was AMAZING! The food is so fresh and tastes great! They were definitely busy and service was a little slow, but I'm not giving them a bad review because of that! The food and atmosphere was great! :)"}
{"text":"Went there with a large group of people with last minute plans and was thankful to still
snag a table without reservations on a Friday night. We came right before happy hour was over and decided to get margaritas seeing it is a Mexican restaurant. The drinks were great... And cheap! Very rarely do I think you can find fulfilling drinks that aren't overpriced in the market square, but this place has them. They paired great with the homemade chips & guacamole!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this place only has three stars...because I had the BEST QUESADILLA EVER when I ate there.  My friend and I wanted something before we went to the arts festival and we were seated quickly and the service was good."}
{"text":"While this place continuously packs them in for lunch every day that I've been there, I guess I don't quite get it.

The service is usually adequate, although sometimes it's slow, sometimes they don't understand what you order, and sometimes you get other people's food delivered to you.

The food is simply mediocre across the board. The chips and salsa are fine. The tacos have been ok. The rice and beans as sides, are, well, filling, I guess.

There's nothing remarkable about this place. I've been here about three times in the last year. Food is reasonably priced for a sit-down restaurant.

If you're in Market square, there are so many other better choices, for similar money, than here. If you're from out of town, I'd skip this place."}
{"text":"I wanted so much to love this restaurant. I wanted to support the Market Square economy and a local business. It was a total fail. I waited for over an hour for my lunch on a Friday. I asked three people about my order, and the first two said \"it would be out shortly\" and the third person told me (40 more minutes). In no world is waiting an hour and 40 minutes for lunch okay. I would like to comment on the food, but I didn't get to try any. The staff was so angry and mean that I then became concerned that they would spit in my food, so I left. This is my worst Pittsburgh lunch experience."}
{"text":"Maybe we went too late, but our \"fresh made chips with salsa\" were cold and stale. Our meals were both terrible, like they were frozen or made a week ago. I got the mango chipotle chicken. My husband got sopapitas. We just threw away our to go boxes because we didn't want the food. Our waiter was outstanding and we didn't want to offend him. He was so good! The margaritas were delicious. My advice is to go early. We went late at like 8:30..."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place only has three stars, all my visits there have been great. This is definitely an overlooked spot in Market Square. I've had the chicken tacos which were delicious. The portions are huge and great to take home for leftovers. Also, make sure to order the trio; it gives you all the chips you can eat with salsa, guacamole, and queso for $10; not too shabby. The ambience is good. Once when I was there a mariachi band played, quite a treat."}
{"text":"I'm a Texan that comes with a lot of experience with TexMex.  This place tries hard but no taco. First of all if you want to have chips and salsa you have to pay for them. Secondly the salsa tastes like it came out of a can of stewed tomatoes and there's very little spice or heat added. No chunks of onion or jalapeño peppers. I think that marinara has more pizazz. I ordered mahi mahi tacos with retried beans and Mexican rice. The tacos were soso. I'd give them a B-, the rice was a C+, and the beans were a B.  The poor girl who waited my table tried hard to please but the person who delivered my food from the kitchen dropped it in front of me without saying a word and was gone. Kinda weird. The place is clean and if you're desperate for Mexican food this place will do. But !!!!! It ain't TexMex."}
{"text":"Went 30 minutes prior to closing to order some food to go....door was open...lights on....but staff informed me that the kitchen was undergoing work..or put another way, closed. And it had been since the last table two hours prior. At least post on facebook that you're closing early so people can know not to come."}
{"text":"There is a line down the stairs and no host or hostess. Every time it's very confusing to see who has a reservation and who doesn't. Also not allowing you to sit until your party is there is not helpful"}
{"text":"I've tried a bunch of Mexican places in the city and I'd put Las Velas near the bottom. The place had nice decor, the chips were good, and the wait staff was nice. The food was typical Tex-Mex stuff. Nothing really stood out and some of my food was cold. I don't think I'll be back here, especially when there's a ton of other Tex-Mex places to choose from."}
{"text":"Las Velas is a consistent favorite for work happy hours. It's never excessively crowded, and is conveniently located right in market square. The margaritas are enormous (and rather potent). Service is very speedy, and the food is always up to par. By far the best deal is the appetizer trio though. The best chips, along with a good sized bowl of guacamole, queso, and salsa. Definitely a must for a happy hour! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Las Velas star rating (in my view) on a time line:
5:00 pm: 4 stars
5:15 pm: 4.5 stars
5:30 pm: 4 stars
6:00 pm: 3 stars
6:30 pm: still 3 stars
7:00 pm: 2 stars

Now some explanation.

5:00 pm: Parking kinda sucked, but eventually we were able to find some street parking.  On top of another restaurant in Market Square, the view is pretty decent since you can look down and people watch.

5:15 pm: The service is very friendly and attentive.  I got my frozen Margarita, which wasn't too bad (or too great).  With the big (32 oz?) alcoholic slush hitting my nearly empty tummy, I was REALLY starting to enjoy my time (hence 4.5 stars)

5:30 pm: The queso and guacamole arrive.  The queso is passable, and while the guacamole tasted OK, its consistency was too smooth and shiny for me. 

6:00 pm: Food arrives.  I got the steak fajitas, which were decent enough.  The marinade was actually pretty good, but it didn't blow my mind.  Unfortunately, it still comes with that shiny guacamole.  I tried my wife's chicken quesadilla and was sorely disappointed.  The quesadilla was very bland and the tortilla not very crisp.  All things considered, I was ready to give this place 3 stars, but still consider coming back.

6:30 pm: Having left the restaurant, I feel that all too familiar sensation...yes, you Tex-Mex foodies know what I'm talking about--the food baby.  You ate way too much and feel bloated, but you know it was probably worth it.  Did I feel like I needed a wheel barrow to move around at this point?  Yes.  Did I care?  No.  I'm used that.  I keep dreaming of a pocket wheel barrow that collapses into my back pocket so I can take it with me to Tex-Mex restaurants

7:00 pm:  While I'm used to the food baby, I'm not used to the food baby demon.  That normally comforting \"full\" sensation turned into an attack on my insides.  Demonic forces at work, destroying my sense of satisfaction... I was relieved to get to the safety and comfort of my home where I could cast out the demon food baby... Argh, another Mexican place in PGH off my list...it's pretty short now."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Las Velas several times throughout the years and have always found it to be consistently good.  This was not the case for my visit yesterday.  My party started with the chips and salsa, both were good, but a little different than they served in the past.  I ordered the lunch chicken enchiladas with the roja sauce.   In the past, the chicken enchiladas were filled with flavorful shredded chicken and the roja sauce was thick, robust and smokey.  This time, my enchiladas were filled with tough, flavorless chunks of chicken and the roja sauce was thin and watery.  The others in my party ordered chicken dishes - burrito and quesadilla and they also had the overcooked, flavorless chicken.  I am not sure if they were having an off day or if this is the \"norm\" now, but I was really disappointed.  They had a really good thing going with a great space that overlooked the square.  I am hoping this was a fluke."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped at Las Velas early on Sunday afternoon. We ran the Great Race that morning and had to celebrate by feeding our ravenous stomachs! I have been looking for a good, traditional Mexican restaurant ever since my old favorite--Nopalitos in Latrobe--changed to bar-only food. This place hit the spot.

The place was pretty bare, with only a few other couples eating. We sat towards the front of the restaurant by the windows overlooking Market Square. Such a pretty view. 

We immediately ordered the chips and queso and attached them as soon as the waitress set them on the table.  OMG were they heavenly. I am not above licking any bowl clean and the bowl of queso was no exception.

I ordered the Puerco en mole poblano and I received two heaping plates of pork smothered in a heavenly molé rojo sauce, pico de gallo, beans, lettuce and guacamole.  After gorging myself on chips and cheese, I was worried I wouldn't be able to enjoy a lot of my meal but I downed three tortillas with ease. I was still left with a TON of food so I took it home. There was no way I was leaving it. 

My husband ordered the Alambres Carne which had the most amazing pork and cheese. Even though I was about to explode, I couldn't stop picking it off his plate.

The food was incredible and very authentic. The service was pretty good expect it took a long time to get our food. I like to think it was because they were actually making everything rather than heating some frozen mixture up.  But the wait aside, it was a fantastic meal and I highly recommend it. Definitely get the chips and queso!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay however before we finished our dinner they prepared for the after hour club. It was loud before with a sport event and even louder after with music and moving tables and chairs right next to us."}
{"text":"It's authentic, friendly, lively, and the chips and salsa will change your life. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We stopped in. A couple days before xmas. The wine and margaritas were tasty, but not cheap. 

The service was slow. We ordered thr poblano dip and chicken entree. Both arrived cold. We informed our overwhelmed server. She microwaved both dishes for us... fresh cut lettuce , tomatoes and all.

Food was terribly bland. 

I would not return."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here, and will make sure next time im craving tacos that this is the place I hit. My food was hot, spicy, tasty, the salsas were delicious the chips were home made ( i think).  Everything was as I wanted it to be.  I so desperately craved some mexican food and this just filled me up and made me want to go back.  The view is beautiful (as everyone else had said), the ambiance was great, the decor was a little goofy but I loved it.  We'll all be going back there soon!  The margaritas were sublime.  SO much better than Mad (tex) Mex."}
{"text":"I had the queso appetizer, shrimp tacos, and sides of the house salad and the poblanos in cream sauce. I also had a mojito and a water.
I'd say good food, good drinks, good portions, moderate prices, and excellent atmosphere.

I took two stars off for service. It took about 15 minutes just to get out drinks/appetizers when there were only 4 tables being served. We then had to wait til our meals arrived to receive our utensils and napkins se we had queso all over our hands until then. I got one refill on my water but that was after I finished my entire meal, so my mouth was filled with pepper spice the whole time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots downtown. By the look of the crowd that Las Velas gets for lunch, it's probably a lot of peoples' go-to lunch spot. Forget about coming here at 12 pm for lunch and not having to wait for a table. My recommendation is to go early at 11:30 or later around 1 to avoid the lunch rush. The space Is small and you have to climb up some stairs to get to the dining room (but it's worth it!). However, with this factor, Las Velas probably isn't handicap accessible. 

The food has never disappointed and I've had several items from their lunch menu. The best way to start off your meal is to order the chips with either salsa, guacamole or queso. My favorite is the queso. It is oh so cheesy, but a bit chunky with tomatoes, which adds not only nice texture but a fresh pop of color and flavor. Also, you can tell their chips are freshly made in-house. My absolute favorite lunch menu item is the Pastor Tacos. The pork is well seasoned, but the bits of pineapple and cilantro add a level of sweetness and freshness that just can't be compared to anything else. Other items I enjoy are the enchiladas and fajitas. For around $10 for each lunch menu item, the portions are just right (and sometimes too big). Most of the entrees are served with rice and refried beans, which are pretty good too. 

I've never gotten anything I didn't like here. Good service, great food."}
{"text":"I'm kind of split down the middle when it comes to Las Velas' food.  I've visited twice now since they re-opened and I've had both very good food and food that left much to be desired.  

I give two thumbs up for appetizers and desserts.  Their chips and queso are muy yummy.  The chips are a bit thicker than your standard tortilla chip so it stands up to the cheese better, which is really delicious with tomatoes and cilantro mixed in.  I also had a really refreshingly sweet dessert with fried pita chips and vanilla ice cream covered with honey.  Well portioned and very, very good.

However, my one dinner visit was very sub-par.  I ordered the tacos checandole which comes with marinated pork and pineapple.  I was really looking forward to a meal of savory sweetness, but the meal was a huge disappointment.  To start, the tacos came out room temperature, not hot at all or even remotely warm.  The pork was dry and rather tasteless and there was barely any pineapple to compliment the rest of the meal.  Our waiter highly recommended this dish, so I was even more disappointed knowing that the dish had the potential to be really excellent.

Typically for a 50/50 meal experience I would still give a place three stars, but our service was also on the poor side at my last visit as well.  All of the servers are extremely friendly and welcoming, but it seemed like after we were seated and received our drinks, we barely received attention from the wait staff to see how we were doing.  My friend and I devoured our delicious chips and queso we ordered and were all ready to order more (additional charge be damned), but no one ever came over to us between the time we received our appetizer to the time our meals arrived to see if we'd like anything else.  So we receive our meals and about a third of the way through my tacos I'm out of my drink.  So I stop eating and wait for our waiter to come by so I can flag him down for a refill.  So I'm waiting.  And waiting.  And waiting.    I waited 15 minutes, nearly 20, before our waiter finally just happened to walk by our table and notice that my drink was empty.  Mind you he wasn't stopped to check on us, he just happened to notice the empty glass as he whisked by.  So of course by the time I receive my refill my room temperature food had gone completely cold.  Such a disappointing experience for what I feel is really promising restaurant.
Despite my two stars, I know I'll go back to the restaurant.  If anything I'll go back for an evening visit for the lovely view of Market Square from the second floor windows.  But if my future dinner service is anything like my most recent experience, I think the third visit will probably be my last."}
{"text":"My college friend and I wanted to eat together so she brought her bagel into Las Velas. Unaware of the policy, our waiter still disregarded this and let it slide. He also told me he would bring out a basket of free chips. In the meantime, another worker comes over to yell at us for the bagel and asked her to separate from me and sit at the bar while I eat. We told them that we were leaving and getting the food to go and he said okay and left. I received my check and was charged for chips and salsa when I didn't ask for that. Then another worker came over and kicked us out and said to wait by the door for my food. As this was the 3rd man to speak to us I'm confused as to why our worker Andres didn't just tell us when he clearly saw the bagel in the first place. I am disgusted with this place and the service. You could've told us nicely. Also I gave no tip because you charged me for the salsa I didn't ask for. Currently sitting in Brueggers eating with my friend because they're the real MVP!!!!"}
{"text":"After planning on going to the gallery crawl we just ended of getting dinner and drinks... whoops. 

We decided on Mexican because \"its cheaper\" but that really wasn't the case here.   The interior is decent.  The bar is set up so its looking towards the windows which opens up the place.  We sat at a table next to the windows and the chips were quick to follow (YES!)  The menu is standard mexican food, nothing really high end.  I wanted the shrimp fajitas but I was turned off by the $18 price point,  i don't mean to be a cheap ass but that seemed steep. I opted for the chicken instead. 

I also ordered a vodka club and a big mojito.  Everything was good!

Pros: Chips and salsa, full bar, solid mexican food, fast service. 

Cons: Pricey for what it is, food isn't as interesting as it could be, no outdoor seating. 

Overall:  One of the best things about market square is sitting outside and people watching so i wish this place had outdoor seating.  I wish there could be seating on top of the patio.  A girl can dream."}
{"text":"The ambiance is amazing. The levels, the lights, the mariachi band, everything about the place screams 'great Mexican food'... except the food itself. We started our dinner with chips and salsa. They were amazing, but weren't free. I'm not going to complain about it, just letting you know that before you walk in the door. My date ordered the 'Enchiladas De La Abuela', which I imagine is a vegetarian dish despite the description since there was little to no meat to be found in them. The sauce covering them tasted like chili powder, flour, and water... end of list. It was completely bland and lacked any discerning flavor. I ordered the 'Mar y tierra OK maguey'. They rolled it out on a cart and lit the skewers on fire in an attempt to add a little flare to the evening. The fire must have burnt any spec of flavor that may have been on them because I surely didn't taste any. The shrimp tasted like they had been marinated in sea water overnight before being boiled in a saline solution and served to me. The steak tasted like a vampire had gotten to the cow before slaughter. Every ounce of flavor had been drained out of it somehow and replaced with the heavy taste of salt. Salt I'm they got from the shrimp's marinade. Baby birds eat better meals than the one I had last night. If the place burned down, the ashes would taste better than the garbage I was served. And to add insult to injury, the bill was ridiculously high, an automatic 15% gratuity had been added, and we were forced to pay for drinks that the server dropped off without either of us ordering them. The highlight of my evening was the moment my face met the cold air as I walked out of the building. What more can I say? Eat @ your own risk."}
{"text":"Excellent modern Mexican food, my favorite is the steak taco with lime sauce. Their guacamole is to die for.  Unfortunately the restaurant was burnt down in a fire late 2010, hope they will be back and running soon again.

7/2011 update: They have reopend!"}
{"text":"David (and his locally-famous blogger wife, Ginny) have really set up a nice place here. The location is great: overlooking Market Square. The lunch gets busy- no surprise there, this is downtown after all. The food is pretty awesome too. Try the Flautas... so good, and the chipotle sauce is amazing. Also, they may have the best salsa con queso in the city. Get it if you get the chips. 

The staff is really friendly and helpful, and the service has always been good too. 

What keeps me from giving this a four or five star rating is a couple of this little thing. Chips and Salsa are an extra charge. They are good, yes, but I prefer when the chips and salsa are complimentary. 

Also, the happy-hour specials leave a little to be desired. The beers are a little cheaper, but nothing impressive. There is a short list of selected happy hour food all priced at $5. While this sounds good each item is smaller than the regular menu version and aside from the street tacos they aren't really a deal. 

So to sum up, definitely worth a visit. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes mexican and good view. The specials aren't that special and you've gotta pay for chips, but I like it."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews. First time I went here it was excellent. Food was great, service was fast, drinks were delicious. Second time a few months later, not so great. Service was slow, wrong orders came out, drinks were forgotten and food was cold. Might give it another try for a better data set, but I might just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went here before the ballet on Saturday...server was good, food was pretty tasty, not the best Mexican but decent enchiladas for the price--I disagree with another review that said chips are great--pretty bland, but guac was good.  They charged us $13 each for a margarita when the menu lists them as 7.50--one size--we asked the waitress who sent over the manager (bartender also) who said they were in the process of re-printing their menus and there are 2 sizes/prices... that is bait and switch...no one mentioned there were two sizes when we ordered! And 13 bucks for a house marg???-- this isn't NYC.  He didnt want to comp anything, then he said he would comp one drink each---which was fair--then when the new bill came he took 6.00 off each bill.  wtf.  I mean if you want repeat business just comp a damn overpriced drink  already, make the patron happy, and we would probably go back and give it another try.  instead, he pissed off four people who eat out all the time...we won't go back.  Oh, and they took my number and assured me the owner would be calling to discuss our dissatisfaction....rigggghhhttttt.  still waiting on that call"}
{"text":"This is the hole-in-the-wall of the Market Square restaurants downtown; I'd never have found if someone hadn't known where the door to the place is. I want to note now that I've only been here once for a spontaneous dinner date - and that only happened because Olive or Twist was completely and totally booked. But now I'm absolutely dying to go here again. The meal I had here hit the spot perfectly.

I'm not even a major fan of Mexican food, so it's very rare for me to heap this sort of praise on Mexican restaurants. I ordered the pork quesadillas, and have to say, they were spot on - also a surprising statement coming from me, because I'm not a major fan of pork, probably because a lot of the time people overcooked pork dishes when I was younger and I grew up thinking all pork is just dry and pretty tasteless. Places like Las Velas remind me that nope, this is not the case - and bless them for it! My meal came with plenty of both the main course and the necessary toppings to spread on each individual quesadilla as I saw fit. There were more than enough toppings to go around, and combined with the juicy pork and toasted quesadilla wrap they made for a wonderful mix of tastes and textures. 

By the way, even if the food wasn't amazing here, I think I would still consider myself a major fan of this place just because of their supremely delicious Peach Margaritas (dying to go back and try the raspberry one). Fortunately the food is as good as the drinks, so everyone wins!

I'll note that even on a not-so-busy night, I, like other reviewers, experienced a little teensy bit of drag in service. Still, I had company and we wanted to talk, so I think as long as I avoid coming here alone or when I'm starving, I'd be able to tolerate this as easily as I did during my first meal here. Still, I can see this being a drawback for folks, so just know it's a possibility here and be prepared. Bring company or a book."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, but it didn't make up for the less-than-sub-par Mexican food. Basically, every dish that we ordered was the exact same thing except it was either wrapped inside a burrito or laying on top of some nachos. I get that most of Mexican food can be like that, but really? It was obvious that they didn't invest any effort into recreating the dishes. It must have taken them 2 minutes each to make a dish since the ingredients were EXACTLY the same for each dish. 

Blah, even with the Groupon I didn't feel that justified the price of the meal! I could have had a better meal at Chipotle across the street...

Also, the inside felt very plain Jane. It didn't feel like a restaurant... there's no ambiance or decor."}
{"text":"Fresh Chips and salsa/ queso are awesome. My steak burrito wasn't seasoned but weighed about 2 lbs.. I would have seasoned it myself , but there weren't any salt/pepper shakers, or hot sauce on any of the tables and the in attentive Wait staff was of no help. My friends chicken fajitas were great and seasoned well. Service was slow as molasses. Overall a good experience. Just don't be in a rush to get out"}
{"text":"So I showed up for a very late lunch. Only one table had the leftover lunch crowd. Lots of workers around, but it took a little time to get a glass of water. Food was great! Always start with the chips and guacamole - very fresh! You can't go wrong with the chicken enchiladas!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants - the food is great and well priced. The service is good and friendly. Nice place to sit and watch all the activity in Market Square. Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"RUSHING customers and CHEAP service!

My coworkers and I have been there several times before, but this time I realized how their servers just need some basic training on how to properly treat customers. In terms of food, I give them a 3.5 stars, but the service is 1 star and I would recommend everyone to think 2x before going, especially during lunch rush.

We first arrived when the restaurant was still relatively empty, and after we ordered food it started to get packed and the server also started to rush us. After waiting for 10-15mins for our entrée, literally within 5 minutes of getting our food she came to give us our bill! I totally understand if she just left it there and wait for us to pay, but after another 10 mins she came back AGAIN and told each of us \"here's your bill\" as if we're blind that we didn't see it the first time. If this is not a sign to rush us out the door, I don't know what is. Giving us 15 mins to eat our food when it took you 10mins to serve it does not seem like the right way to treat customers.

In addition, we ordered one salsa and one queso for three people as appetizer and we were served 1 portion of chips. That's okay because we thought we could get more. But then we didn't ask for more until the end where she already rushed us to pay the check, and at that point the server said we could not get anymore because it's only for dine in. Thanks for giving us one order of chips for three of us with 2 sauces and not letting us get some more at the end for to-go. Now we have about a whole bowl of sauce left with less than 10 c hips! If only we asked for it before we paid, she could have given it to us..but we'd just pack it to go anyways. So what's the difference?! It's just rude....if you want your restaurant to be more empty during lunch hour, well, your wish came true.
Let's just say there are also items we found in the food we didn't complain about or the missing food items that we let go of."}
{"text":"their food is good, but their service is nonexistent. our server took our drink order. he took our meal order. we didn't see him again until he gave us our check. we had to flag down another server for refill drinks. we were there on Saturday and they were more than half empty"}
{"text":"I am from Texas, I understand what real Tex-Mex is, and this area is lacking in choices.  I have been to Las Velas a few times now, and always found the service to be excellent and attentive.  The queso with chorizo is just outstanding.  The other food is fresh and well prepared.

They have a good children's menu, complete with American choices, so your youngster will not feel left out.

The restaurant itself is a bit odd.  It sits above Diamond.  There is a small door leading immediately to a staircase, at the top is the restaurant.

You can get a table overlooking market square, which is fun, especially during the holidays.

As with all things, expectations need to be managed, if you chose to come here at 12:05PM on a Friday, it will be crazy busy during the lunch rush.  Thus, service will not be as attentive as you might like.  However, they will still take good care of you, and provide you with an excellent taste of Mexico, right here in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this restaurant for the longest time, and last Thursday we had the chance to do so. First of all, we had to wait for our food for at least 45 minutes, and the food was terrible. The salsa that came with the chips had too much cumin. The shrimp \"a la mexicana\" was swimming in butter. The dish was so greasy and lacking in flavor that I couldn't finish it. The only thing that tasted good was the refried beans that came with it. My husband ordered arrachera tacos which were very dry and only had a little bit of chopped onion and cilantro on top. I had to ask the waiter to bring some salsa to put in them, but he brought this sweet thin sauce that was awful. The kids had beef quesadillas with rice, and that was okay. All in all, a very disappointing experience. I gave them two stars because the ambiance was really nice, but we will not go back."}
{"text":"Decent food but terrible service. While around the corner, we called to see how long the wait would be and they said half an hour so we go to put our name in. He then tells me it'll be an hour and 15 minutes and when i explain that someone just said half an hour he looked at me like I was crazy. Finally we get a text saying our table was ready so we took our name out of another wait list and go to the restaurant. When we get there we find out our table was not ready and we had to wait for another table to finish paying, which took an additional 10 minutes for us to finally sit down. When we did and ordered it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to bring us our drinks and then an additional 45 for them to bring us our meals, if not longer.  When the meals finally did come, my boyfriend's burrito which we asked for no pico de gallo and guacamole on the side, and the guacamole came in the burrito so we sent it back. When the next one came, it had pico in it so we had to send that one back too! when we got our check, not only did they rudely charge us for the burrito, they charged us for the side of guacamole even though guacamole came in the burrito and we just wanted that on the side!! When I brought this up, the waitress tried to argue with me saying that she couldn't do anything because guacamole costs money, and she only said she'd speak to the manager after I reminded her that they messed up the burrito TWICE! In the end they only took off the price of half the burrito and still charged us for the guacamole!! Worst experience ever, food is not good enough to go and I will never be going back nor do i ever recommend anyone going"}
{"text":"Came here after the Pens championship parade last week! They were on it! Every single employee was busting their heiney to serve the hungry and thirsty guests! I love to see a staff that works well together, and that's the case here. I've been here once before, and remember the service was great then too! The drinks are a good price, and so yumo! Lunch menu is a great bargain, and just enough to fill you up. See drink pix attached. Can't wait to go back soon."}
{"text":"Their chips are to die for- home made and delicious. Get the chips and queso - you will love them"}
{"text":"Went here for late lunch one Saturday with a friend and i was decidedly underwhelmed. The Cozumel Burrito looked very promising, but was pretty \"meh\" when I got it. It was OK, but the sauce was a little ketchupy. My friend was reasonably satisfied with whatever it was he ordered, but neither of us was blown away.

The biggest gripe I had with this place was the service! We'd just come from a 20 mile bike ride on a hot day, and although I'd been guzzling down and refilling my water constantly, I was perpetually thirsty. I left my water bottle outside on my bike assuming I could get a nice cold glass of water on entering. I literally asked our waiter for water at least 3 times before we got it, including once getting up and walking across the restaurant to the bar. When he finally brought us water, he was not in the least bit apologetic for the delay. Were they busy I'dve been more understanding, but as I said this was post lunch-time rush and there weren't a lot of other tables. This was, however, during the world cup, so maybe the football was decidedly more important than his customers."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first because I'm a cycnical asshole. But my girlfriend forced me to go in.

The food. Was. Delicious!!! Oh my gosh!

And some employee there.. I think his name was \"Justin\", helped me decide which entre would suit my palette best. He really went the whole nine yards! 

Great food! Amazing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Intimate sized restaurant, seems as though the gentleman who took our drink order may need a little more training but with the right tools would be just fine.  There were three of us and we ate lunch specials, enchiladas, mahi tacos, and chiles rellenos.  I got the chiles rellenos- I was worried about the spice level but it was so great, a clean taste and just the right amount of heat.  I am SO glad I decided not to take the negative reviews seriously, because everything was great.  We even forgot to ask to have our checks split in the beginning, we apologized and asked at the end... even the chips and guacamole was split between three checks and we only got one order of them.  We really didnt wait long at all for the food, the server girl was very nice.  I will be going back again and again, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Had they not gotten rid of the banana margarita they would get all 5 stars from me!  Great food, good prices, and very friendly staff!  The fish tacos are amazing!  If you order one of the meals with the flame next to it they put on a little show for you and light your food on fire at your table!"}
{"text":"I honestly can't speak to all of the food since I get the same salad every time I come here but it's delicious. The salsa/guac/queso is the best way to start off any meal! The waitstaff has never been anything but nice and I love the atmosphere. Great casual restaurant."}
{"text":"Blah-tastic,.  You know it's restaurant like this that stay open for decades and no that is not a good thing.  I got the shrimp tacos, can some one please tell me how can you F#%K up a shrimp taco? There were 2 shrimp inside of each taco and the were breaded and fried!!! In my universe shrimp tacos should always be made with grilled shrimp and especially if 2 tacos cost $8.00!!! 
It makes no difference to me if the Mexican food I am eating is authentic or not.  I love TexMex food but what I don't love is old freezer burned fried shrimp in my tacos. What a disgrace."}
{"text":"Finally, decent Mexican food in Pittsburgh! By now, I thought I would never find it but Las Velas is hands down the best I've had in the burgh. Granted, there are a few places I haven't tried yet which are supposed to be good, but for now this one wins!

Chips and salsa were good and appeared to be homemade. The margaritas hit the spot, but the Coronas strangely came without limes.

I was quite pleased with the chicken burrito verde I ordered, and others in the group enjoyed their tacos al pastor and mole enchiladas. Many of the tables have a nice view of the square, and the only drawback of the whole experience was the service. Unfortunately, our waitress was often absent when we needed something, and I had to chase her down so we could pay our check and leave! From what I could see, the other servers were doing a better job, so this is probably just bad luck.

I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"It can be difficult to find a good mojito in this town.  Correction: it can be difficult to even find a mojito in this town.  Look no further than Las Velas.  They make them fresh and delicious!  I can't get past how yummy they are, but the sangria is also rather refreshing.

I've been to Las Velas several times and will continue to return.  I've experienced several menu items including the hanger steak tacos, mango chipotle chicken and a pork burrito.  The mango chicken was just okay.  I'm a fan of the hanger steak, so the tacos didn't have to try to hard to please me.  But they did anyway.  I most recently enjoyed the Xel-Ha Burrito with pork and this proved to be my best decision yet.

I've had a seat at the bar but I prefer a table.  Grab a seat by the window and enjoy the entertainment of Market Square over some chips and salsa.  

The cost may seem a little high, but it's worth it.  The portions are generous and I can often find a deal online (Groupon, Google Offers, WPXI Half Off).  I've never had a problem getting a table for dinner.  And to top it off, the service is always muy bueno!"}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos, and highly recommend them. They're a little spicy with a nice, crisp cabbage, which is exactly how I like them."}
{"text":"Note to self.  

Take Mexican off the cuisine types to have in Pittsburgh.  Nothing can ever compare to the authentic, cheap, and just plain good stuff in the Mission.  I went into the dinner & drinks with low expectations because I was excited to see friends.

The margaritas are overly sweet and syrupy, but the bartender that served them is HAUTE!

We started the dinner off with chips & guac, and the guac was definitely the blandest I've ever had missing the core elements of salt, lime, flavor.  I brought it to the waitress's attention and requested salsa to spice it up.  We incorporate the lime wedges from the margaritas and some salt, which made it edible.

For our entree, we ordered 2 rounds of tacos.  The fish was ok, batter was very flavorful, but much too heavy.  The carnitas was over cooked and dried out.  Just not good.

Service was decent, and the prices weren't bad, but I would never return.  Even for the HAUTE bartender."}
{"text":"I work in downtown Pittsburgh and have been to Las Velas several times.  Chips and salsa are excellent. Service not so much.  The food is average.  Good place for happy hour.  Wouldn't recommend for a date night."}
{"text":"Craving Mexican(ish) food we decided on Las Velas in Market Square since we wanted to try something besides Chipotle or Moe's (which can both be found next door).

Food: Obviously Americanized, but I was surprised to find Tamales were the Special that night. They were mediocre, as were the Carnitas Tacos and our Guacamole, but portions were large and fairly priced.

Ambiance: SO LOUD. They had a Mariachi band making rounds and \"serenading\" all the tables, which could be fun if you're out with friends, but in my case I secretly wished they would stop playing so I could enjoy my dinner conversation without having to yell over the music.

Bonus: There was a foursquare special of $10 off $10 when using an AmEx card, but none of the waiters seemed to have a clue when I showed it to them. In the end, they just took $10 off the bill!

Overall: Seems like a happening spot for Happy Hour, but I probably should have just went to Chipotle or Moe's."}
{"text":"So after visiting on a few occasions I have visited this carefully crafted pseudo Mexican restaurant I am ready to weigh in on it's qualities.
First let's start on the critiques, having come from the West Coast I am intimately familiar with the awesomeness of authentic spot on Mexican food. Las Velas attempts to meet this authenticity but it all seems disingenuous and forced. They are trying to capture the feel  but instead it feels like a hipsters view of a bar in Puerto Vallarta. That's it the only \"negative\" I can find. 
Now let's rock the good stuff!
Their house margarita is ROCK SOLID!!! Two of their tall house margarita's had me with that warm fuzzy feeling in my tummy! Great when only having two and I'm no lightweight! The burrito's are done in the wet burrito style which makes for a great burrito but last time there was no question what kind of meat I wanted just delivery of my ordered burrito and NO MEAT! Good burrito but felt unfulfilled without good meat in the middle.
The good is solid Mexican fare but nothing jumps out at me as a WOW except that killer house Margarita! If you're looking for solid food with killer margarita's then this is your stop! Trust me living DAHN TAHN I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but the new lunch menu today pushed it over the top. 

We ordered chips and salsa cause you have to order chips and salsa.  The chips are definitely homemade and awesome.  The salsa is full of fresh tomato flavor and cilantro.  They do charge for chips and salsa ($2.50), so don't be surprised when your bill comes. 

It was a lovely day to be in the second story in market square overlooking the grand prix cars and the many people out in the miserable heat.  Pittsburghers do love their old cars.

Back to the food, M got Huaraches which she loved.  She got chicken as the meat option.  They also had lettuce, sour cream, refried beans and cheese.  It was served with Spanish rice that I never enjoy, but love here. 

I got the vinegar soaked pork tacos.  Sadly, I don't remember their real name, but I will need to when I come back.  It was nothing but pork and habenero vingar soaked onions, but damn, did it pack some punch.  So much flavor on a homemade corn tortilla.  It was served with rice and black beans.  

Great lunch option in market square - one of the best views in the square!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place for happy hour but I've left sick more than once... on the food... not the tequila!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't good, but not bad either. I came to eat here with a friend and her family after walking in the Pittsburgh Pride Parade this year. When we arrived, it wasn't super busy. It was kind of clear that the wait staff was understaffed, as they were running around from table to table. We ordered our drinks and had a wait quite a bit before we could order our food. I went with the veggie quesadilla with extra guac instead of sour cream. Although the quesadilla itself was never basic and nothing special, the guac was really fresh and delicious. My friends and her family enjoyed their meals. We waited so long for the bill that I ended up giving cash to her family and walking out with my friend. I think this place has a lot of near by competition, considering they are in Market Square, and I think they should really staff more. It got rather busy as we were leaving and I can't imagine how overwhelmed they were when we left."}
{"text":"It was ok here. I went for lunch and had a Xela burrito. I ate the whole thing but my mind wasn't blown or anything. Next time I'll prolly just go to Chipotle which is across the square."}
{"text":"While touring Market Square with some out of towners, we  stumbled upon Las Velas. I say stumbled upon because it is very easy to not even realize this place exists. We only knew about it because a guy over at Wingharts raved about the margs. The door is in between the Oyster place and the Diamond grill place and leads directly into a stairway that takes you up onto the second floor. This is fantastic, as every seat in the house has a view of the square. This would be an excellent stopping spot for a day when a lot is going on down there. 

We had a couple of dishes here, and none of them disappointed. The chips were fresh and the food was tasty. The service was pretty quick as the place doesn't ever seem to be packed.

If you have a craving for some Mexican food and feel the need to watch over the town while you sip on an ice cold beer stop in to this place."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with co-workers this week, and I was fairly underwhelmed.  The staff was friendly enough, but it took an awfully long time to get served food for a place that has such a large customer base coming from businesses nearby.  The food itself was just okay.  I have admittedly high standards when it comes to Mexican food, because I lived in Southern California for so long, and half of my family is Mexican to boot.  It wasn't terrible or even bad, just it was just \"meh\", and the temperature wasn't particularly hot.  I suspect that the kitchen got backed up, because the servers seemed pretty on top of things.  I'm also not a fan of shredded iceberg lettuce, which I believe has no real place in Mexican food, and the refried beans had an odd taste that I couldn't quite place.  I probably won't seek this out again; there are too many other good spots in Market Square."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Nice atmosphere and the service was  5 ***** worthy. 

Reasonable prices aswell."}
{"text":"Well, the food is good, but comes in kiddie sized portions. I ordered the lunch tacos for $8.50 and I am pretty sure my 3 year old son would still be hungry afterwards (unlike an entree from chipotle which would feed him for three days at a lower cost). Not saying the food is bad, but I definitely will never go to this restaurant again given all the better alternatives in the area. Seriously, it's good, but a giant rip off when it comes to their child like portions.  Yeah, this restaurant definitely irritated me in multiple ways, adios."}
{"text":"Excellent spicy mango cayenne and rsaberry chipotle margarita.  My mahi mahi tacos were great, fresh tasting.  My husband got the mole also good with nice flavor not overly chocolatey like some I've had.  Tortilla soup was more brothy than I've had at other Mexican restaurants but had really nice flavor.  Prices were very reasonable.  Good service."}
{"text":"As a Pittsburgh person with limited Mexican cuisine experience, Las Velas is good solid Mexican food.

I've been pleased with my lunches.  You have to get there quick though, otherwise there will be a line and a wait."}
{"text":"What an awesome place to hear some tunes.  You thought I was going to say grab a bite to eat (even if it is an amazing place to get some Mexican influenced grub).

Saturdays seem to have turned Las Velas into a dance club with a Latin twist.  You get to hear all the great popular dance music that are hits today, but you also get to hear the Latino dance songs as well.  The part of the restaurant that overlooks Market Square is transformed into a dance floor and is instantly crowded.  Speaking of crowded, this whole place is crowded from the time they start, until the moment that last beat drops.

Drinks, ¡Muy delicioso!  I have a soft spot for margaritas, and Las Velas has definitely found that soft spot and exploited it.  I couldn't get enough!  Margarita not to your liking, try anything else here and I'm sure it'll be just as good.  Full bar can never disappoint.  Chips and salsa, Chips and queso, can't decide, I suggest both.  

Need something to do on a Saturday night and are in the mood to be downtown, I strongly suggest stopping by here."}
{"text":"Good food, I had the Cancun burritos and we tried the tacos. I would recommend both. 
Only complaint is slow service and paying for chips."}
{"text":"This place is good but not great. My boyfriend and I went here on a whim because we were walking around the city and it looked nice. The atmosphere is so so. The floors are super super super slippery and our table was not sturdy whatsoever but the environment itself was hip. 

We tried the mahi mahi fish tacos with guacamole and mango salsa. The fish was over cooked which was surprising because the restaurant seemed empty and so the cook should've been able to pay attention to fish.

We also tried the carnitas quesadilla which was really good. I always try carnitas because it shows if a Mexican restaurant is legit or not. I ate the entire meal which is rare. 

Overall this place is good not great. If you're in market square and want Mexican it's better than chipotle. However there are many other great restaurants right there that I would give five stars."}
{"text":"I've come here a number of times and I would say it's decent Mexican food (for Pittsburgh).

Atmosphere - they recently remodeled and the decor is really nice. Warm and inviting. The bar area has flat screens with sports on. I love the view of Market Square.

Service - Get here before the lunch rush and you should be fine. It gets a little slow during the lunch hour. The staff are quite friendly though.

Food - as I said, it's decent Mexican food. The lunch combo is a good meal and not too large. They do charge for chips & salsa. The tortilla soup has a nice kick to it."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been frequent patrons of this fine establishment for years now and today was the straw that broke the camel's back. We were a party of 8 in for lunch, literally the only people there, and were treated like CRAP by the bartender who was also our server, with an insanely bad attitude right off the bat. There was a HAIR in my margarita. When I told her about it she said, \"okay\". I'm sure if I didn't actually hand her the drink she wouldn't have even offered to make me another one. Doubt there was any booze in the next one. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"A great place to go for Mexican when you are Downtown.  The Menu has some interesting stuff on it and is priced very fairly.

Make sure to get chips and salsa to start with, they are very good.  The guacamole is also tasty.

One thing that I did not like was that they had a \"Las Velas\" and a \"Las Velas Guest\" WiFi network and when I asked for the password, they told me that their WiFi was not for customers.  Why have the guest network then?"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely terrible. I mean the meat was as non fresh as it could get. The staff sucked. Terrible place. It is ashame it was so terrible because it is in a good location. From Long Island, and I will make sure to find a better place next visit."}
{"text":"Las Velas is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food is excellent. I highly recommend the fajitas and if you get the chips, spring for the queso. 

The only downsides are that they haven't jumped on any apps like No Wait or Open Table, the limited accessibility (2nd floor location - steep stairs) and of course, the chips and salsa aren't free."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times over the last few months and Las Velas never disappoints. The food is always great and our service has been excellent. The bartenders are knowledgeable and the margaritas are always delicious. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"The food was not very good at all. Definitely should not be considered authentic Mexican. Service was horrible. There was no one in the place / at the bar and it took forever to order / get our food. 25 minutes to get a fried ice cream? Really?!? WILL NOT BE GOING BACK."}
{"text":"I have a mixture of feelings about this place.  The decor and ambiance is pretty cool.  They have lots of seats next to a huge window overlooking Market Square, and there's not a lot of cheesy faux-Latino decorations strewn about.  The food is  also good.  It's a little fancy for Mexican, and it's a little pricy for the quantity, but it's interesting and tasty.  The service is where things go downhill.  Patently inattentive and slow.  The drinks were also bad, including the draught beer.  If it was in my neighborhood, I'd probably give it another try; but since it's across town, I'll probably never go again."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the soups, beans and margaritas, fresh fruit as opposed to fake syrups make them tasty. The strawberry cucumber one is awesome

I wish the salsa had more heat and flavor 


Service never seems to be very good though and the place can get loud and noisy"}
{"text":"Such a shame that the service is such crap, because the location is great and the food is pretty good.  That service though - ranges from just plain bad to awful every time.   

Yesterday's visit was no exception.  I arrived at 3:55.  Joined a friend at the bar for 10 minutes and was not even greeted, let alone served.  Gave up and moved to a table once the rest of my party arrived.  You can't sit without a full party, which is also annoying.  At the table, 20 more minutes went by before we finally got up and went and asked for a server.  Meanwhile, there were three men standing around doing nothing.  A two tables next to us were sat and served before someone ever bothered to come by take our drink order.  And when someone finally did, she fumbled through it so badly that we felt bad about trying to order.  

All told, it took me 47 minutes to get a single drink.  47 minutes.  And then another 10 or so to pay so that we could leave.   Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Love this place, definitely one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. The waiting area is super small and crowded, but you may be able to snag a seat at the bar while you wait. The margarita choices are great- I love that you can mix flavors. Everything I've ever had on the menu has been great (lunch combo, mahi mahi tacos, burritos, enchiladas). Service is good and it's a nice atmosphere as well. It does get really crowded during lunch time here."}
{"text":"Returned a few times and had an equally good meal, much much better service.  Very happy.  Margaritas are great.  Can't stop eating chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it 0 stars. INCREDIBLY rude staff who told me initially that they could not make me a reservation because they do not take reservations. Then another man (the owner) told me in an incredibly rude and condescending demeanor, that they wouldn't have anything for my party size at the time I requested, and that if i walked in at that time they would turn me away. I have been to this restaurant over 20 times and no one has ever made a reservation in my party, and the restaurant has never been more than half full. I am INCREDIBLY infuriated. What happened to the customer is always right??? No way to treat loyal paying guests. Disgusted."}
{"text":"The tacos margaritas and atmosphere were amazing! Really enjoyed this place. Will be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent!  Great quality for decent cost. The service is quiet but friendly and the decor is great. Good food, good drinks, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Loved the mango filet taco and regular margarita. Wish the salsa and queso were a little thicker though."}
{"text":"This review is for the poor service. It was so bad, we walked out before our main food ever came. It took 25 minutes to order food and after 1 1/2 hours, we asked if our food is on the way. The waiter made excuses saying he doesn't usually work with these cooks today and that they have their own thing going on back there...blah blah blah...basically, he didn't want us to blame him for the bad service. But, they're a team and he should've be on top of it. We walked out after sitting there for two hours and empty drinks that haven't been checked on for 30 minutes. This place needs to be on the RESTAURANT IMPOSSIBLE SHOW. We will never eat here again and strongly suggest anyone shouldn't either. There are way better Mexican restaurants in town that have authentic food with better prices. If you're looking for authenticity and good service, you should go elsewhere. This place is reeks americanized Mexican food and clueless waiters. Don't disappoint yourself by going here."}
{"text":"Since Las Velas is one of the hot spots for night life in Pittsburgh, it also deserves a review! We have been constant customers for Las Velas night life and have been pretty disappointed by the service during saturday night latino dancing! Starting off with the basic sitting room, there are only about 10 tables available for sitting down to have a drink. To use a table you have to pirchase a bucket of beers that usually will cost you less if you go to the bar. There is a waitress that will attend to you at the tables but god knows when she will be back to bring you refills.  A bucket can vary in cost 60 to 70 dollars per bucket and is only beneficial if u have more than 2 people drinking. If you stop drinking buckets of beer, the waitress will ask you to move once you decide not to continue with another bucket even if you still have alcohol to drink from your bucket that you had purchased. The small sala de baile that when dancing you feel as if you are in a bumper car hitting up against a maximum of 20 couples who are able to dance at a time. The rules in regards to tables, alcohol etc continuosly change so although this review may provide an estimate of current pricing that is not to say that without warning the restaurant management will decide to change costs at will."}
{"text":"The Mexican food here isn't going to rock your world but it is decent.   The chips and salsa are addicting.   The guacamole is good but not amazing.  I made a lot of so-so choices on the extensive menu until one day I tried the mahi mahi tacos, which have become my go-to on the menu.  The tacos have avocado, pico de gallo and some kind of creamy chipotle sauce. Topped with fresh lime, it's very flavorful.   They also come with a healthy side of beans and rice.

The turnaround at lunch is very quick and you can stop here before a show in the evening with no wait.  I also love the margaritas, particularly the mango one."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch there this week, lingered a little after the meal to talk, never been so hustled by a waiter to pay & get out as I had at Las Velas.  Super aggressive waiter came to table 4-5x, loudly broke up an important conversation several times, repositioned the check in the center of table to basically tell us to get out, incredibly rude and inappropriate way to treat customers, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Bobby and I stopped in yesterday. I read online that they had good happy hour specials and we havent stopped in for awhile (New Years 2013 was our last visit I believe..)

So for happy hour, the appetizers are half off (besides chips, salsa and queso) The maragaritas are $2 off- both small and tall. A small is normally $6 and a tall is normally S10. I believe the same price goes for the sangria which is also $2 off for happy hour. They also had happy hour specials on some beer but i cannot remember the beer or the price.

Bobby ordered the margarita and I ordered sangria. I loved my drink and Bobby had no complaints about his. The drinks were strong and we felt a little buzz off of one so I bet after two we would've been *turned up* :p .... We had somewhere to be and could not be on that level though, lol.

We also ordered chips and queso. I'm really picky about queso (Moe's=ewwww) I really liked Las Velas' queso however. We finished it with some chips to spare so we ordered salsa. It was good.. not chunky though :(  I love me some chunky salsa haha."}
{"text":"Short version: It is bad. Don't go. 

Long version: I wasn't expecting a lot with a Mexican place in Pittsburgh but this was way below even this low bar I set. The chips are extra, they were mediocre at best. They were cold, thick and on the verge of stale. It took forever for my drink to come, but it was a drink at the bar so it's understandable. It was kind of hard to eat the bad chips without anything to wash them down though. 45 minutes later we got our extremely cold enchiladas. Even if they were warm the taste/seasonings were awful. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I ate meals at this Mexican restaurant two times. I like the chips, salsa, guacamole, chicken quesadilla, and steak fajita. The ceviche was very large and tasted OK but was not as good as ceviches that I have eaten at other restaurants. I did not care for the taste of the soft tacos and did not finish them. Beans are beans, rice is rice, and corn is corn, so nothing special there. The waitress was nice, but she incorrectly ordered my husband's lunch, so he had to wait for another entree to be brought out while I ate mine."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were good but that's where it ended. Dry meat on my tacos, my wife had a really bad salad. Chicken coated with sauce that was more like Italian sauce than anything Mexican."}
{"text":"Las Velas is great authentic Mexican food in market square.  I definitely recommend the Velada which is served in a cutout Pineapple bowl with tons of different meats and cheese.  It is perfect for two people and delicious.  Las Velas is very laid back and usually no need for a reservation."}
{"text":"I was in town and was looking for a good Mexican restaurant.   This was recommended to me by a local I met.   The location was great as it was in the middle of market square.   It was on the second floor which was cool as you could look at the square from above.   

I sat at the bar as the conversations are a little bit better and you can get a glimpse on what really goes on.  Overall the place was ok.   My biggest issue was that they didn't provide chips and salsa (free).  Don't get me wrong, I am not cheap but WHAT MEXICAN FOOD RESTAURANT DOESNT PROVIDE FREE CHIPS AND SALSA?????  The obvious answer is this one.  

I got the 4 Enchilada plate (2 chicken, 2 pork) with verde sauce.   The chicken was a little chewy but the pork was pretty good.  It also came with 2 sides so I got the black beans and cilantro rice.  Overall it was pretty good.   They could do a few more things to make this place good."}
{"text":"We were here for Taste of Market Square.  While the bartending was a bit slow that day, I can tell this place has promise.  The tacos they were giving out as part of the event were really good, and the margaritas, while slowly obtained, were very good.  I do plan on coming back here with my husband to get the real experience of this place."}
{"text":"I'm not one to typically write reviews on here. Pittsburgh is a place with few good Mexican restaurants and this is one of the better places, but after the customer service my friends and I received last night I doubt I will ever return. 

We had already eaten at another restaurant earlier that day and just stepped in for drinks and dessert. My girlfriend and a mutual friend ordered a pitcher of sangria, which our friend had mentioned she had gotten there for $11.00 several weeks ago. There were not sizes mentioned on the menu, but they did show for a price for about 8 ounce and a price for 23 ounces = around $11 dollars. They naturally assumed this was the pitcher and order it. We got the pitcher, and were at first excited since it looked like the container was holding about 40 ounces--maybe they didn't account for the ice, we though. However, when we got the receipt it showed a $35 dollar charge for a margarita pitcher. We called the server over who explained that the pitchers weren't on the menu and that the pitchers for sangrias and margaritas were recently made the same price (even though 23 ounce mojitos were listed at over $20s on the menu?) She got a manager who agreed that there was about 40 ounces in the pitcher, and I asked how then would it be more expensive than buy two \"large\" sangiras which would have been over 46 ounces. He then simply stated that the owners set the price, not him, so there was nothing he he could do. I asked about price discrepancy for the sangrias and margritas and the menu, and again he blamed the owners. 

He then took our cards and rushed away. I was livid and mentioned I wanted to talk the the owners if that was the case. We got our cards back and stay away debating what to do. Maybe 15-20 mins past and another server (or manager) came over with shots of tequila and apologized, saying that they recently changed their glassware and that is why the pitchers were off the menu and there were no pricing options. They couldn't even keep their story straight. The staff here obviously was trying to take advantage of us, either because they thought we were relatively young, more drunk than we were, or both. The comp obviously did not make up for this ordeal or the fact we were fed lie after lie to cover themselves.

Its a shame I can no longer recommend this restaurant to any friends or family."}
{"text":"Good spot in market square for drinks and food. Great appetizers and wide selection of tequila. Not a fan of their soups. 
Bartender named Richard was nice enough to let me print my ticket for justin timberlake. Slower service but overall always have a great time there! Limited seating at the bar."}
{"text":"Las Velas is awesome! Best queso I've ever had!! The food is delicious and extremely filling. We had plenty to bring home. While it is moderately expensive, you get your bang for your buck. There was also a mariachi band which was sweet. Plus they have really strong margaritas :) Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I've been to Los Velos a few times now and every time I've eaten here I've had a great meal. The service has always been great and has always quick and friendly. The enchiladas are freaking great! Seriously, add some habenero sauce and you are good to go my friend! My wife had the chicken fajitas and she said they were great.

Would highly recommend this place. It's right in the square and it's always easy to get a seat, even when it's busy. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Closed 40 minutes early. Worker said they were slow. Wonder why if people think you close early. Cause your own problems. Fail."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now for lunch. The first time I had the Cajun burrito and the second time I had the Xel-Ha burrito, both $8.56 with tax. I was pretty satisfied with both. The Cajun burrito has shrimp and steak, and the Xel-Ha has a choice of meat. I ordered the Xel-Ha with hot salsa, it is was probably the spiciest Mexican dish I have ever had. It was almost like Thai food.
The interior is pretty nice with windows looking out over market square (well, not such a nice view until the city finishes construction). The roof is essentially one giant skylight, but they keep it covered during the day.
Service was good and it is a good price for lunch (dinner is much more expensive though). Their menu is online if you would like to see more. I prefer this place to the Mexico City restaurant.

{"text":"My friends and I love las Velas as an after work spot! It's a small Mexican restaurant that sits somewhat hidden on a second floor space in market square, and if you can stand the trek up the flight of stairs then it's worth it!  For the prices they offer, you can't beat it.  The queso is ridiculous, and I love the chicken quesadilla (my go to). I highly recommend trying Las Velas if you're looking for good, quality food, but not looking to spend your life savings on dinner!"}
{"text":"Ok, ok,ok, I came back. I've decided to put the last encounter there behind me. While I'm still not pleased about it. This last visit is exactly what I expected from this business. 

Seeing the google offer for Las Velas and having it literally right next door to work was too good to pass up. Not to mention the offer IS good for alcohol as well as food anytime after 4pm, INCLUDING happy hour. It doesn't get any better than that. 

As soon as I walked up to the bar I was greeted by not one but TWO employees. I had a water while I waited for happy hour to start. The waitstaff stands next to the end of the bar where I was sitting while waiting for tables and drink orders to be completed. Small talk was made and it was pleasant.

The margaritas were strong as always. The air was light and cheerful. None of the anxiety driven rush rush rush of my last visit. We had cheese with salsa and fresh made guac. They were a great addition to the drinks. We got so much for the 30$ offer. I'd still love to try a meal here one night after work, as I've yet to try any actual entrees. 

My only advice is that if you have the google offer to print it out before hand. While you don't have to, I did have to go into the office and log into my google on their office computer to print it out there."}
{"text":"Eh. The boy and I saw that Las Velas was open again and we felt like giving it a try. It was okay. Not really Mexican per say. More Tex-Mex. There wasn't much spice to our dishes even though we did order the more spicy dishes off the menu. Eh. The decor is WONDERFUL, but the food was just okay. Though the chips and salsa are worth the money, it was probably the best part of our meal."}
{"text":"Yummm!!!  I got two tacos, Mexican style, which was just perfect since the tacos come with large portions of beans and rice.  The chips are homemade and AMAZING.  I could just eat chips and salsa here and be happy.

Why only three stars?  The happy hour \"special\" on margaritas was $9, and they weren't very strong.  I've had much better elsewhere in the burgh.

But since Las Velas is so close to me, I'll be back for more chips and salsa...and next time I'll try the sangria."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Friday nights ago with my wife for dinner.  We knew that we were going to be downtown on this evening and so picked out that we wanted to head to Las Velas a couple of days before hand.  Part of my motivation is that it was in the Enjoy book but I also remember having some good food here in the past.  Las Velas is located on the second floor of a building and can be a bit tricky to find if you don't know where to look.  Hint, it's between the diamond market and the original oyster house.  In any case after heading up the stairs we were greeted by a hostess and sat at the last table available.  Due to that, I can't say that it was the greatest table or that I could see much of the restaurant.  We were seated without a wait though and so you won't see me complaining.

For dinner on this day my wife and I decided I split the chips and salsa (bottomless) for an appetizer.  After looking over the menu for awhile I also decided to go with the most expensive thing on the menu, the  velada.  While it sounded good on its own, I was also influenced a little bit by the little fire sign next to it which I assumed meant spicy.  Our chips and salsa came out first and I rather enjoyed them.  The chips seemed to be freshly made and the salsa was blended quite smooth and was flavorful.  As we were on our second basket of chips our entrees came out.  What I wasn't expecting was the show that came along with my food.  It was described on the menu as half of fresh pineapple shell filled with chicken, steak, shrimp, chorizo, grilled peppers, onions and cilantro all topped with melted cheese and served with sides of tortillas, guacamole, sour cream and pick de gallo.  What it failed to mention is that there is a tequila sauce that is prepared table side and then poured over the dish.  This preparation consists of the tequila being added to the sauce and then lit on fire before being poured between two gravy boats until the alcohol was burned off.  Overall it was a pretty cool presentation that I can't say I was ready for.  The sauce they made from it was dynamite though and had a nice tequila flavor with most of the alcohol being gone.  Everything in my dish was delicious, especially whenever it was combined with that sauce.  I think my favorite of the meats was the shrimp (I got 3 of them) due to their natural sweetness.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Both my wife and I enjoyed our food and the dining room has a nice view over Market Square."}
{"text":"This place is run of the mill and generic as far as Mexican restaurants go. I, once again, ignored my lactose intolerance and shared the queso dip with my sis. It was addictive and I was sad when it was done.
We also shared the beef fajitas and ordered extra tortillas so that there'd be enough to go around. And, thank GOODNESS. The portion was huge and the meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned. It came out sizzling with sides of rice, sour cream, guac, and refried beans that was really enough for just one person. We couldn't even finish the beef and veggies, they were so plentiful.  We were quite happy to have the leftovers for late night eats. The service was great and it was a low key place to grab some good food before a night watching some a Point Park Conservatory Performance."}
{"text":"Food is above average but the value is average. Wait times during lunch can be quite long. Good veg options is that is your thing.  Overall nothing that strongly makes me want to go back."}
{"text":"First, let me preface my review by saying that I am not a Mexican food fan. I have Cuban and Puerto Rican family and really prefer these cuisines over Mexican. When I found out that my workplace's dinner to Il Pizzaiolo was changed to Las Velas, I was pretty disappointed. 

My coworkers and I started off dinner with drinks, and I selected the House Margarita. Personally, the drink was a bit strong in alcohol yet way too sweet. For food, we started with appetizers for the whole group; chips with guacamole and salsa dotted the table. This was actually my favorite part of the meal. The chips were perfectly salted and crispy. The guacamole was mild and smooth while the salsa provided a fire roasted kick. 

Though we were a large group, dinner took a very long time, approximately 1 1/2 hours from ordering to serving. We quickly became antsy, especially since our meetings started very early the next morning. We saw folks around us sit down and enjoy their food as we were still waiting for ours. Eventually, our food emerged from the kitchen, including my steak fajitas. The steak was a little chewy and tough while the tortillas were a bit hard. The leftovers have been sitting in my fridge, and I have little motivation to finish them."}
{"text":"Happy hour fans rejoice! This is a great little spot for indulging in some cheap post-work snacks and libations. Located above Diamond Market in Market Square, Las Velas is a fairly typical Mexican restaurant. Their happy hour runs weekdays from 4-6pm, and I was shocked at how few people were taking advantage of this on a recent Friday evening when I was there (come on, Pittsburghers, I know you like to drink!!) 

Anyway, the happy hour specials are $2 off of house sangrias and margaritas, as well as half off appetizers (excluding chips and salsa or queso). My friend warned me how strong their margaritas are, and I didn't want the evening to turn into a dancing-with-a-lampshade-on-my-head kinda night....so I opted for a sangria. And it was delicious! For food, my friend and I shared some chips and queso/salsa, chicken flautas, and chicken quesadillas. 

Considering the happy hour prices, I was quite pleased. It's not Mexican food that will blow your mind, but it's definitely decent for happy hour munchies. Their chips are homemade and perfectly thick and crispy. The salsa was typical Mexican restaurant-style salsa...thinner and more sauce-like as opposed to thick and chunky. There is a decent amount of cilantro in it though, so I'm a fan. Their queso was very rich and cheesy. It was good, but for my tastes, they could have ratcheted up the flavor and spiciness a bit. The flautas and quesadillas were both also decent...crispy without being greasy, and generously stuffed with fillings. Each also came with abundant guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, and pico on the side to dress them up as you like. The one thing I will say across all of the food is that it was all a little lukewarm. It wasn't lukewarm to the point of making it inedible, but I think in general the food could have been served at a higher temperature to make it more enjoyable.

As for the service, it was fast and friendly. All in all, my friend and I had a drink (she had two), and a ton of food that left us stuffed and happy, and we walked out of there each having paid like $12 or something. For the price, this is definitely a happy hour winner. Bottoms up, mis amigos!"}
{"text":"On a Friday after putting in a couple hours of work, my boyfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to a happy hour and a bite to eat. It's always nice to take a walk down in Market Square, and who can say no to margaritas?

Las Velas is on the second floor of a building down in Market Square, and they have some seats along the windows so you can check out the lively scenery while you eat and drink and hang out. Happy hour is 4-6 here, and the Friday deals were a couple dollars off Don Julio margaritas that made them $8 and $15 and $5 Mexican draft beers. A little bit of an expensive happy hour, but we got a couple drinks anyways. Chips and salsa aren't free here, so we upgraded to chips and queso. Happy hour appetizers are $2 off, but it doesn't include salsa, guac, or queso. Both of us got tacos, chicken for me and mahi mahi for my boyfriend. Prices on the menu were pretty steep across the board, but when our tacos arrived the portions were fairly generous, and we got two sides with each meal.

Overall, Las Velas was good, but not great. The drinks tasted good and some of the ones on the menu were pretty creative. The food was also pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the happy hour deals or the prices in general, but we were satisfied with everything. Above all, I really liked the location and the layout of the restaurant. Not a bad choice if you're craving a splash of tequila!"}
{"text":"The food was good but there seemed to be a lack of communication and no consistency between morning staff and night staff. My friend ordered the same drink 3 time and got 3 completely different drinks. I ordered the shrimp ceviche. It was  good but very spicy. I never had it before so I can't judge on good it really was. The queso was delicious ! I do have to say I was very happy they moved happy hour to 3:30 ( it's normally starts at 5) for us because we had such a large group."}
{"text":"I chose to only give Last Velas three stars because of lackluster service. It's something that seemed to have been missing recently when I stopped in for lunch with my parents on a Saturday afternoon. The food is good, not amazing, just good. Location is great...being in the heart of Pittsurgh's historical Market Square. Check it out."}
{"text":"I was really sad when the cigar bar and brew house closed down years ago but was really happy for a Mexican restaurant to pop up in it's place. Unfortunately, this place has proved disappointing on many occasions.

The first time I ate at Las Velas, I had a really great experience. I ate really light but it was really good. All I ordered was the tortilla soup and I stole some bites of my cousin's refried beans. Both were excellent.

A few months ago, I met a few friends for dinner at Las Velas and did not have the same feelings about the place I had initially had on that first visit. The food took forever to come out and when it did, I had wished it away. The Seviche was disgusting. I love seviche but this was a soupy mess. Nothing tasted fresh about it. The very look was off-putting. All of our tacos and tostadas had dry meat lacking any true flavor. It was a disaster of a meal.

I did try and go back. I understand where a restaurant may have an off day and was willing to give this place another shot. Unfortunately, when I stopped in the other day I was sat at a dirty table and handed a dirty menu that I stared at for 15 minutes (in solitude because a waiter never came) before walking out. I can only give a restaurant so many chances before I just don't want to risk spending the money on a potentially disappointing meal. Save yourself some frustration and walk over to Bea's Taco Town on Smithfield. You'll be much happier and satiated."}
{"text":"I was staying in Pittsburgh for business and this place wasn't too far away. I tried to go there for dinner the night before, but I couldn't find it. The light wasn't on. I ended up walking into a different restaurant. So, it's located above the Diamond Market and the door is right next to the Diamond Market on the right. You walk up a long flight of stairs and you're there. The service here was pretty bad. I was sat by my server Aracely. She asked me if I wanted a drink when I sat. She brought it out and took my order of chicken fajitas. Someone else brought me my fajitas. I never saw my server or anyone else again the rest of lunch. Mind you there were only about 10 people eating in the entire restaurant. I finished my Pepsi about half way through my meal, so it sat empty the rest of the time as I had to eat the ice to wash down the fajita. I ordered the corn tortillas, I only got 4 of them. They were small and I had lots of food left on my plate with no tortillas to put them in. Plus I hadn't seen my server in about 15 minutes. I finished my meal. The server shows up, takes my plate and asks if I want a refill. Of course I don't, I'm finished. Didn't bother with dessert or anything else. Not going to go back. Food was average and service was horrible. Too bad too since it's really close to my hotel and I have 2 more days here and I love Mexican food."}
{"text":"My mom and I used to love this place, but it's really gone down hill. Especially the service.

We were seated quickly. They accommodated our need for a highchair (tip: carry your babies - you have to walk up a flight steps to get to the restaurant. not stroller friendly.)

The chips are yummy and the queso + salsa are good. That's really where the good things stop.

The waitress was a hot mess. We've had her a couple times. She NEVER listens when we're ordering, but we've started to think that she doesn't understand English real well. Which is fine - except when you're taking orders from people.

The food used to be fast, hot and delicious. Now It's:
1) Slow
2) My quesadilla was so soggy/cold that I couldn't eat it and had to ask for a manager

Also, the waitress brought me re-fried beans instead of fries for my son's kids meal and then instead of just fixing it - she kept insisting that we said beans (for my 1 year old? I don't think so)

This last experience left a bad taste in my mouth (literally), so we're back to looking for a good go-to on my mom's lunch break in the city. Blah."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Las Velas (recommended by a friend) and for the most part I enjoyed it!

Pros: SUPER cute atmosphere, I wish I got a picture, but I'll let you go see it for yourself! :P The prices were great, even non-happy hour prices. Although the beers included in Happy Hour aren't the greatest, $3 for 16oz ($1 off), I'll take it! The apps were $2 off I believe. (Keep in mind, their happy hour alters per day, so these were Friday prices.) My group had the nachos and they were actual VERY good! They were freshly made nachos (still warm when they came out) and the salsa might've been house-made? It was very authentic!

Cons: It was very warm in the venue! We went on a warmer day and I don't think they had any air conditioning - it probably doesn't help that they're on the second floor of a building though. The staff was a little difficult to understand, but that wasn't a huge deal to me.

Overall, I probably would return to Las Velas since my friend swears by their tacos! Maybe it won't be as warm during the colder months. No deal breakers though!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem is a great place for happy hour! The Frozen Strawberry Margarita is my favorite and the tacos are delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, and I wanted to like Las Velas so much, but in the end I'm just underwhelmed.  I've been there twice (once pre and once post fire) and my experiences were almost the same.  Food is average and slightly disappointing.  It just didn't seem like there was any creativity or special about any of their dishes.  

Bottom line, I'm still looking for the great Mexican Restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Average food not worth the price. Pork burrito had very little pork in it."}
{"text":"I've been to Las Velas too many times to count. This is my go to spot to take friends for the BEST queso in Pittsburgh! It's a hidden gem in Market Square. It's above Diamond Market so it's sometimes overlooked by newbies to Dahntahn. 

Stopped in last night for HH before the Pirates Game. Staff was attentive and friendly as usual. The only drag is that there always seems to be a delay at the bar. Drink refills take a while, which is not a plus during HH. I want to get the most for my money! 

My friends and I ordered the following:

Large margaritas- two strawberry, one regular, and one mango cayenne. All delicious! The mango cayenne is my favorite and talk about a double whammy punch to the tastebuds. The alcohol in the margs is strong so along with the plentiful addition of cayenne pepper, it's a poweful hit to the senses. 

Chips, queos, gauc and salsa. The chips were a different variety this time (that's how often I go there- I even know the chips! ) They weren't the fresh cut & fried corn tortillas. They seemed like the type of bagged \"authentic mexican chips\" I hope this isn't a permanent change to the menu! Queso was amazing as always, gauc was fresh with huge chunks of avocado and salsa was mild and refreshing. 
Even though we didn't need it (chips and dip is filling!) we ordered two quesadillas, stuffed jalapenos- stuffed with fresco cheese, ground beef, chorizo and drizzled with tamarindo honey sauce and one order of Sopecitos- 4 corn tortillas, topped one each of chicken, steak, chorizo and carnitas and cheese. The stuffed jalapenos were each large and lit my mouth on fire. Well done, Las Velas! The rest of the food didn't dissapoint... my go to is usually the Sopecitos! 

Once again, Las Velas was a great choice and I'm sure I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Sat at bar with great service. The Guac was fresh and tasty. We got the lunch platter and once it came out we ate it all. The burrito, enchilada and taco combo was great. Fresh flavor and all so filling. Another person in the party got fajitas de carnitas and they were great the pork was spiced right and comes with onions,peppers and also rice and beans. Will be back often."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many many times since it is located only a block from my work. I wouldn't say the food is spectacular but it is ok. The thing that keeps me coming back is their queso and margaritas. As for the entrees I've tried the enchiladas with ground beef, ground beef tacos, tortilla soup, and chicken quesadillas. Everything but the soup was good. It certainly wasn't worth raving about but it's good. The soup however I would not recommend. The onions didn't taste like they were cooked fully and it was basically just broth, onions, cheese, and some tortilla strips. It had no real substance to it. 

The main reason I give this place a lower 3 rating is because of the service. Each time I am here the staff is at your feet making you feel rushed. I can understand that you are downtown and you want to turn over tables but bringing checks right after receiving my food is too soon. To then come back while I'm still eating and mention again that you have left the checks there waiting is very rude. I wish I could say this was a one time occurrence but it has happened multiple times and I always leave the restaurant frustrated. 

Ambiance: 3
Food/Drink quality: 3

{"text":"If I could give it 0 starts I would.  Went there on a Saturday with about 8-10 people and had the worst service from the female bartender.  It was almost that it was bother for her to make drinks for our group.  I believe we dropped about close to $300.00-$350.00 on our tab, but I am sure we can find another establishment to support next time we are in Market Square."}
{"text":"FIrst time eating there today during lunch.  Other places were packed on Market Square so we went there.  I didn't know it existed.  Others led the way. 

There are a good amount of options on the lunch menu from $8 to $10.  The wait staff passes out menus and says \"Do you want chips and salsa\".  I have been to many Mexican restaurants that give it out for free.  Here they neglected to say that it is $2.50.  It was very crowded and it took 45 minutes for our meals to come out.  Everyone liked their meals in my group. I had a chicken Quesadilla.  

If you are looking for Mexican in downtown Pittsburgh, worth trying out the place."}
{"text":"Busy place on a Friday. Good place to share drinks with coworkers and get some basic Mexican food. Children friendly if the rest of the family shows up. Roving Mariachi band makes for a fun time."}
{"text":"Omg, can't believe I've missed a Mexican restaurant in/near Pittsburgh!  Went here with my miserable (Pitt lost) husband after a game. No friends were in tow...so perfect for trying a new restaurant. We got a window seat right away and continued to love the night. I had the chicken enchiladas and my husband had a burrito....along with the chips, salsa, drinks......soooo good. Fresh, large portions..hubby admitted (after fried ice cream) it was a winner!"}
{"text":"I am so glad this place reopened!

I had went here for a happy hour months before the horrible Market Square construction had from my understanding shut Las Velas down. Now that it's back in business, I had to try it again.

I'm very pleased to find nothing has changed. 

Great frozen margaritas, check.
Amazing salsa, check.
The best homeade chips, check.

One of my favorite things about the restaurant is the view overlooking Market Square, well now that it's completed and the homeless problem has been elimated. I find the prices reasonable and the staff is always friendly.

And I always make sure to ask for a refill of my chips even if I may be dining alone."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh. The collection of cocktails at its best. Especially I'm in love with Micheladas."}
{"text":"I had a terrific experience at Las Velas!! 

I really like the location of this restaurant. 2nd floor of a building in Market Square. Inside decor was nice. Good amount of seating. Nice and cool (temp) inside. Actually arctic circle cold in temperature. I run like 50 degrees hotter than most people, so I was good (albeit I did lose a couple fingers due to frostbite). 2nd floors can get hot...not here. 

Food. Honestly, great!! Start with chips and salsa. Those dang chips were delicious. Bottomless. $3. Great value! For the main entree, I had the enchiladas. Listen...get the enchiladas. Carnitas. They were ohhh so good. I got those with Spanish rice and guacamole. Aside from a stray pepper making its way into the guac (hotter than the sun, like the devil's breath mint) that meal was flawless and so, so tasty. 

A friend of mine got steak where the waiter comes out and pours fire on it to prepare it - at the table. I know that's not the most accurate description, but that was impressive. I'm surprised his hands are still intact. What a treat! 

You enjoy great Mexican food? Look no further, Las Velas is your place. Try it out. Huge portions. Great food. Great value. All in the heart of our amazing city. 

It can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it -5 stars!!!

Still sitting here... 45 min and no food. 4 tables came in after us. They have food and are almost done...

Asked for a manager.. Oh, there's NO manager here!!!!!!

We will never be back!!!

What kind of place doesn't have a manager?

Foods here 50 min later and it's horrible!!!!
Cold and bland and disgusting!!!!

Never again!!!"}
{"text":"The view was beautiful overlooking the newly reopened Market Square. The food was average. If only Mexico City could move to this space, both the view AND the food would rock!"}
{"text":"So my Mum gave me a coupon to Las Velas. And let me say the free entree and the free queso appetizer that was ordered by someone else but accidentally brought to our table were the two highlights of the evening. My trip to the drugstore for Tums a couple hours later was the low point. Everything else was below average. I'd rather go to Chipotle across the street."}
{"text":"Had my first experience here and it was really good. I started off with a Mango Cayenne margarita. I was really curious about the combination but it was quite good. Just the right amount of heat from the cayenne/salt rim to add spice but not overwhelm the drink.

The chips and salsa were good, but nothing spectacular. 

For the entree I had tex mex tacos with beef, carne and chorizo. The chorizo was particularly good and the other were tasty, though again nothing spectacular. The poblano side was a real star for this meal though. The poblanos were spicy and the cream sauce was delicious. 

This is certainly one of the better Mexican restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"Service was terrible! We ordered way too much food and the waitress did not care to tell us. The \"family style\" fajita dinner is basically fajitas for one times 3! Didn't understand their menu at all. They charge for chips and salsa and even extra tortillas when we had three fajita dinners. The best thing was the chips and the guacamole, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"After taking in all of the holiday sights downtown we were starving. Mexican food is our favorite so we gave this place a try. It sits above a seafood restaurant in Market Square. We were given a table at the windows which was nice. We could watch the shoppers walking by 
We were waited on immediately. We ordered drinks along with chips and salsa. The chips were tasty and a nice carrier for the salsa. The salsa had a great flavor. 
I ordered the Burrito Cancun. It had steak and shrimp. There was poco, lettuce and sour cream on the side. The hubby ordered chicken enchiladas. He had green sauce on half and red sauce on half so we could try both. His enchiladas came with refreshed beans and rice. 
I took one bite of my burrito and I was in heaven. I'm not sure how they treated or cooked the steak but it packed a big punch of flavor. It was also very tender. It was excellent. 
I tried my husband's enchiladas. I thought I would like the green sauce better but was surprised that I preferred the red. The chicken, like the steak in my burrito, was flavorful and tender. The enchiladas were spicy but you began to have a slow after burn in your mouth. It was the perfect heat. 
We left clean plates and with full bellies. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"my coworkers and I go here for lunch all the time.  the guac. is great and always a must for us.  The food always tastes fresh and delicious.  We love it and can never wait to go back!  the service is okay, but I usually don't expect much during the busy downtown lunch rush time.  All-in-all, I say it's definitely a must place to try if you are ever downtown."}
{"text":"This is normal, Americanized Mexican food, but at a price point that is appropriate for resturants at Market Square. Expect to pay $30/head for tacos and a drink.

It looks nice, the service is nice, the view is nice, and expect to pay for it. Not the food. Got tacos and so did me hombre. Tortillas were stale. Spanish rice & beans were nothing special. There are way better values in the Square. There are way better Mex places in the Burgh. 

TL;DR: The food there is disappoint."}
{"text":"Mexican food is Mexican.  In my mind it's hard to mess up and hard to be knock your socks off good. So here's why 4- stars.  Drinks were pretty cheap especially given its location in downtown Pittsburgh. You could get a giant marg for like $12, and a very large beer for $5-9.  BUT Here's the really sweet bit.  If you've ever been to Mexico, not your perfect white resort, but I mean real Mexico you know what spicy food really tastes like.  This place definitely has the closest thing to authentic-prep your bum for the next day - spicy that I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Nice spot in Market Square with kid options and authentic cuisine. Service was a little slow, but the wait was brief. We were forgotten by our server when we requested silverware and refills of drinks, but the food was pretty good. May or may not frequent again."}
{"text":"Always a go to favorite of ours. The restaurant is family owned and they couldn't be better people. David and brother Hugo use family recipes and service is top notch. Not much I don't love. Their homemade chips and salsa, anything mole and tacos are our go to. We had a lovely lady bar tender that we had not met yet and she recommended some tequilas for us to taste and what was a Monday post gym meal turned into a fun night. Tequila will do that. Other best choice would be the stuffed jalapeños."}
{"text":"I consider this place a hidden gem Because I had no idea it even existed as the door is in a corner and it's above Diamond Market. I met my friends there for happy hour. The frozen margaritas were delicious, strong, and worth the $5. They had the perfect mix of liquor and flavoring. They have about 5 happy hour flavors to choose from. 

I also had the nachos which were $5. The portion size was huge for the price and for a \"snack\" we didn't finish it. Only complaint was, there was a lot of beans (if that's even a problem) and some bites the beans over powered the other flavors. At the same time though, the fresh cilantro and great pico gave the nachos a great fresh taste. 

The table beside us ordered fajitas and the smell was intoxicatingly good. When I go back that is what I'm getting."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to meet up with friends on a random warm weekday afternoon as we have done quite a few times, but a cold Friday night, apparently not so much. 

It was busy when we walked in, so we had about a 10 minute wait to be seated, which was just fine (party of 3). By the time we were seated, Happy Hour had just ended- it was 7:01 and our server reminded us so as we took a look at their drink menu- I thought this was sort of rude since we had been there waiting for our table, but I didn't say anything about it and we just paid full price for our drinks. Not a big deal. 

We ordered chips and queso as an app and it was very good. When our meals arrived, our server did not provide silverware and completely disappeared. We let this go a minute or two but ultimately someone had to get up from the table and find an employee to get us some forks so we wouldn't eat like cave women with our hands. 

The other two's drinks were fine (the margarita things with the upside down beer in it), but my \"raspberry margarita\" just tasted like ice with a little alcohol- no real taste at all. I didn't say anything because we saw our server so few times and so far in between I knew I'd just be left without a drink. 

I asked for no avocado on my shrimp tacos and sugar on my margarita but when they came out, the tacos came with avocado and salt on the rim. Once again, didn't say anything because neither made a huge difference on my meal so I just dealt with it. 

A few times I felt our server (sorry I didn't even catch her name) was judgmental or rude and made me a bit uncomfortable. When we finally got our checks, the machine was out of paper or something when she ran our cards so they had to refund my bill and charge it again or something? I never did understand what exactly they had to do but it took over 20 minutes to receive our cards back to leave. 

I hate to write such a negative review of this place as it is one of my summer favorites, but tonight had too many things wrong. I'm hoping tonight was just an off night, and  it will not stop me from coming here again, however."}
{"text":"Was in a rush this evening to get back to the hotel and get some work in, this place proved to be just the spot. Tucked into the square and located upstairs means you might walk right by. Plenty of food for the money and food was up quickly. I will say I agree with many of the other posts nothing really outstanding about the food however I will say best fish tacos that I have had in Pittsburgh so far on my many trips. I would go agin when craving Mexican or needing to eat quickly and go
Get work done."}
{"text":"Being another single digit February day, I decided that some Tex Mex lunch was in order to warm the day up. I ventured out to Market Square to give Las Velas a try. It may have been a cold day but it didn't keep this place from filling early.  I was hoping to get a seat by the window (or at least a table seat in the dining area) but the bartender / server, noticing that I was solo and \"encouraged\" me to have a seat at the bar. I thought, \"okay, so they want to ensure that couples and groups get a table... I'll play nice\".

After looking at the menu, I ordered three tacos Tex Mex style (one steak, one ground beef and one carnitas) with hot salsa. The meal came with two sides so I chose the Esquires (Mexican style corn) and black beans.

It took about 25 minutes for my order to arrive which I think is a little long to throw three tacos together and when the dish arrived the tacos were sitting in a pool of juice from the corn making them all soggy on the bottom. I propped my plate up on one side by putting my phone under it so that the corn juices wouldn't continue to assault the tacos.  Other than being soggy, the taco's tasted okay, the black beans were uneventful and sadly, the corn was the highlight of the meal with it having a tangy, slightly salty zing.

I feel I'm being generous by giving Las Velas a three stars rating. If you were looking for Mexican food in the downtown area and you stopped and asked me, I would point you in the direction of Bea Taco Town on Smithfield over Las Velas (unless alcohol was a deciding factor). They put out a higher quality product with more attention detail in a much shorter wait time."}
{"text":"Andrea was an amazing waitress and the food always blows me out of the water. I'd post pics of my meal but I ate it so quickly there's not much evidence left.  I got the burrito salad, it was awesome! If you love mexican food it's the place to be"}
{"text":"I got to try Las Velas for the first time as a member of a 17 person party celebrating two birthdays.  It was a Saturday night and the restaurant had business, but I wouldn't say it was busy.

     We were one of the first couples to arrive so my lady and I ordered drinks.  They offer their own margarita-esque concoctions which we tried.  I went with the Mango/Cayenne variety and she ordered the Raspberry/Chipotle.  We ended up exchanging drinks due to mine being pretty damn good and hers tasting, like you'd expect, a lot like ice cold alcoholic chipotle juice.  After I got most of the bits of chipotle through the straw, the remainder of the drink wasn't half bad.

     Once the party arrived and everyone got drinks and some chips/guac, It took a little longer for our server to return to order entrees, but It just felt like he was giving us all time to settle in with the menu.  It seemed like my fiance and I were the only ones to order a first course, but I like to try as much as possible when dining out.  She got the ceviche and when the server didn't recall the soup of the day off the top of his head, I went with the tortilla soup.  Her ceviche tasted pretty OK.  It had plenty of citrus with lots of tomato and onion and the portion was really large.  One thing I got from it was that it was most likely yesterday's cocktail shrimp and precooked flaked white fish by the texture of it.  My tortilla soup was quite a large portion, maybe 10oz or more by the look of it.  I thought it tasted great, the tortilla strips were a little soggy, but still had their crispiness, and the broth was tasty.

     For our entrees I ordered the chilis rellanos with pork and she got the red snapper al cilantro.  Once we put our orders in our tables didn't have to wait long to be served.  She enjoyed her fish, which was small bites of white fish in a nice cilantro herb sauce with the typical sides.  She was only able to eat about half the ceviche and entree before filling up.  

     My rellanos were kinda disappointing. I ordered them because my go-to at most Mexican restaurants is chilis poblano, which is identical to what I ordered (some places the 'chilis rellanos' is bell pepper instead of poblano).  Well the pepper was nice, battered roasted poblano, but the sauce was pretty boring, and the cheese it was stuffed with wasn't melted or delicious like more fairly priced joints outside the city.  The cheese itself was really spongy, with a texture most comparable to tofu.  The pork that was also stuffed into the pepper was slow roasted and cubed up, and was just OK.  It probably would of stood out better if it was coated in piping hot liquid queso.

     In conclusion, we had a great time, I didn't hear any complaints from the rest of the large party.  Luckily I live east of the city and can find better quality of Mexican if I make a drive the whole way down rt22 to Delmont for Picante Grille.  Also I'm sure rent @ market square is steep, but suck it up and give up a basket of chips and salsa on the house for every two guests seated at your restaurant.  Rely on the quality of your chips as well as the guacamole to up-sale that 2nd basket or the upgrade to the guac.

     I should also note the dining room is well maintained with a great view of the square. We lucked out and finally had some snowfall the night prior, so it was beautiful out.  I'm not opposed to going back, but without some coaxing this won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I love this place! Sometimes the service is a bit slow but I usually go here to catch up with friends so I don't mind. The margaritas are fantastic as is the guacamole. I don't really stray too far from my usual order which is the pork tacos with onions and cilantro. They're amazing!"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Mexican food in Pittsburgh this is the place to go! Food was amazing, portions were big. The salsa and guacamole were delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food. One of the best I have had. Great tacos and drinks!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with this place!! Has the best Mexican cuisine in Pittsburgh hands down. It's a gem on the square.  I love their handmade chips and fresh salsa. I'm forever convincing friends to try this place out. I always order their breaded shrimp tacos. Their happy hour has reasonably priced margaritas!! I've been here many times and only once have I had a mediocre experience. Most of the time the staff is friendly and attentive. The atmosphere makes me feel like I'm somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went in on a Saturday afternoon by myself.  It was my first visit but I they made me feel like a regular there.  The server Justin was very friendly and did an excellent job.  The owner came out and was telling stories about bull fighting in Mexico which was very entertaining.  The prices are a bit higher than Mexican restaurants you might be familiar with but the portions are large and the quality is better.  The warm chips and fresh salsa are excellent even though you have to pay for them, they arte worth it.

Food:    5 stars
Service 5 stars

I will definitely be go back."}
{"text":"Las Velas is not recognizable as you are walking through Market Square but if you look up from the Diamond Market, there it stands! You walk up a flight of stairs and then just somewhat awkwardly wait at the top of the steps for someone to seat you. It was a very busy Sunday in Pittsburgh (Pride/Arts Festival) so they were busy and somewhat understaffed so I noticed people somewhat confused and possibly frustrated waiting to be seated. I met my party there so I did not personally experience this, just observed it! As for the food, definitely an A rating. Yum! I ordered the chicken fajita ($15.50) and it was purely perfection! Drenched in oil- the chicken, peppers and onions complemented one another beautifully and it totally satiated me, not to mention it is healthy and gluten free (as long as you don't eat the tortillas). If you are somewhat concerned about healthy choices when you go out, I think it is important to note that the tortillas, rice, refried beans, pico, guacamole, sour cream, cheese is served on a separate plate. You can always just ask for your pico and guac on the side without all those naughty extras! Up to you, just something to note. I think $15.50 is a little steep considering that their lunch pricing (available M-F) is $10 but who am I kidding?! I would still order it again at that price point! The food is fresh and good quality. Las Velas salsa was nothing to write home about but you could tell the ingredients were fresh! Also, if you go on the website, the food and drinks pretty much look exactly the same in person! The atmosphere is simple yet fun and the restaurant does overlook Market Square, which is an added bonus. There is free parking after 6pm, 2 hour limited pay parking before 6pm or valet. This information can be found on their website. I would recommend Las Velas if you are in the mood for fresh, Mexican food in a nice location."}
{"text":"Nice, authentic. Nothing on the tables (salt, pepper, hot sauce) was a little weird, but the food wasn't without taste. It probably didn't hurt me that the chips and salsa were sparse, because I tend to go overboard, but when they aren't free, be liberal with the portions.
I don't get to Market Square often, but if and when I make it back, I will definitely consider returning here."}
{"text":"Been going to Las Velas for several months mainly for happy hours and grabbing a quick bite to eat. Their happy hour specials are pretty decent, the drinks are large and strong. 

We usually order their trio chips which is a great deal, especially during happy hour ($2 off appetizers depending on the day you go) and it comes with salsa, guacamole, and their queso. All three dips are great, but their queso deserves an honorary mention. Best queso I've very had and the tortilla chips are homemade and served warm. Depending on how hungry I am, I'll also order a chicken quesadilla which comes packed full of chicken and cheese. I'm sure you can ask them to add other things to the quesadilla, but I've never tried - would be excellent with beans and jalapenos. 

Overall, Las Velas is a great place for happy hour, grabbing quick Mexican food, and catching up with friends, or unwinding from the week on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"Very very disappointing. I thought that this would be good because it was located in market square. 
My strawberry daiquiri was very syrupy and my tacos were dry. Pretty place but would not come back. I would have much rather went across the street for Primanti Brothers"}
{"text":"I was touring Pittsburgh and I was craving Mexican so I picked this restaurant located in the beautiful Market Square area in Downtown. The food was just ok. I was not impressed with the food at all. The guacamole dip did not taste like what a guacamole is supposed to taste like. Ditto for the 4 cheese enchiladas with the side of rice and beans. 
If you are ever in the Pittsburgh area, I suggest another type of cuisine and do thorough research before choosing a place to dine anywhere in the Steel City."}
{"text":"Came in here Friday for some lunch and was impressed the space - they have a couple different levels, with a bar and tables overlooking a square-in-progress. I tried the Las Velas Lunch Combo for $10 (one burrito, one enchilada, and one taco served with rice and beans.) The enchilada and taco were pretty dry, but the Cancun burrito (Marinated steak and shrimp, melted cheese, pico de gallo and guacamole) was pretty good. Chips and Salsa were good along with the service."}
{"text":"Las Velas is hands down my favorite place to go for after work happy hours!! Great margaritas, great food, friendly staff. I have to warn you - the margaritas are definitely strong, which has never been a bad thing in my opinion. I started going to Las Velas is 2015 and over the past 3 years they have never disappointed me. I would definitely recommend if you're looking to go have a drink with friends and have a good time and eat a little Mexican food. The trio appetizer, gives you queso, guacamole, and salsa. Their salsa isn't the best salsa I've ever had but the queso is 100% a must try. i've never had better queso anywhere. I usually get a cheese or chicken quesadilla off the appetizer menu as my entree. It's cheap during happy hour and definitely delicious."}
{"text":"An easy spot to miss in Market Square, but sooo good! I tried it out at lunch time. Come early because this place loads up around noon. I had the lunch special veggie tacos Mexican style (topped with cilantro and onion) - very good! My group shared the dip trip (queso, salsa, guacamole) which was fantastic - I wish they'd give more chips as we ran out, but were left with so much dip. Seems like it would be a great happy hour spot. Loved the interior look and feel and has a view overlooking the square since you're up on the second floor. I will return!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were headed for the disaster at the Cabaret On The Square, and stopped for dinner at Las Velas before the show.  We had a few hours to kill and decided on trying some new Mexican place.  

Maybe it was great company, but Las Velas did not disappoint.  Hugo, the over-gelled but otherwise very nice and kind of hot waiter (seriously...in da burgh, what DOES it mean when a waiter keeps winking at you? I think it simply means tip hard) was very nice and helpful.

We ordered the poblano dip, an iced tea (since Pepsi products are served) and my friend had a water.  Then for the main course, I ordered the steak burrito, and my friend the quesadillas.

It was slightly pricey for Mexican food, but what else would we expect for Market Square?

The Poblano dip was a little runny, but VERY tasty.  The chips were a little over-puffed, which made them frail in the dip, but they were adequate and tasty.

The steak burrito was large and stuffed, and not only was the steak tasty, but the sauces were 'real' and very flavorful. The sauce wasn't the standard 'red' sauce, but it was real veggie and spice enhanced.   It had zing and flavor.  I LIKE hot.  And no, to me, the standard Pittsburgh version of 'hot' doesn't cut it. A Jalapeno to me is NOT hot.  An Habanero IS. And when they asked if I wanted hot or mild, and I asked for hot, it came hot.

The burrito came with guacamole, sour cream, and some pico de gallo, which added to the flavor.

My friend devoured her quesadilla, which came with rice and refried beans, so fast that I thought I'd blinked and missed something.

The bill, with an appetizer, two entrees and one beverage, was around $40.  

The atmosphere was very pleasant...heck, we even had one hell of a show as the Occupy Pittsburgh crowd of 20 made their way through Market Square...with six police cars blocking traffic and four local 'media' vans setting up for the five minute span of activity that took place, including one local 'creative' type who wore a pup tent and danced around mindlessly.

All in all, Las Velas was a very nice place to go for a flavorful Mexican meal, with decent service, and the added bonus of a hot Latino waiter winking, who was delightful to watch 'walk away'.

For the budget minded, I might recommend Mexico City a few blocks away, but Las Velas is a little better in the atmosphere department, slightly higher in the flavor department, with only a slight hike in the price department. 

Give them a try."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Awesome.  

I've been here several times and it has never disappointed.  

This place is as authentic Mexican as it gets in Pittsburgh.  I'll admit I've only ever ordered a variety of their taco selections but that is because they are so incredibly delicious.  I love the Filet Mango Tacos as well as the fish tacos.  All their ingredients taste so fresh and love their combination of sauces and spices.  Their salsa is not my favorite, but the queso and guac are quite tasty and flavorful.  I believe another true sign of a great Mexican restaurant is if their rice and beans measure up - they do here.  The authentic Mexican cheese on the beans...so yummy.  

I do like the margaritas, but don't ever drink more than two!  They are uber strong!

Bonus - family friendly.  They have high chairs.  :)"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has NO selection when it comes to Mexican food.  Sorry, Pittsburghers, but Mad Mex is not Mexican.  That said, Las Velas is the best there is to offer.  Chips are delicious.  Guacamole is the best i've had in Pittsburgh.  I do think it's tacky when places charge you for chips, though.

The burritos are HUUUUUGGGEEE!  The hot sauce is tasty but spicy, although I do have a low heat tolerance but next time I would stick with mild.  It was bordering on the \"Ow\" and \"it hurts so good\" line.

This place will def get me thru the Mexican food withdrawls while I'm here.  It's a lot pricier than Mexican food should ever be but the owners must know there's no real competition."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today and had two chicken tacos and the chips n' salsa/guac.  The guac was really really good.  Unfortunately, it was about the only thing.  The chicken tacos were average at best and I hate to say it but I think the chicken is fresher at Chipotle.  My stomach hurts."}
{"text":"I loved my dinner here! My boyfriend and I splurged on this meal. For appetizers, we got fried jalapenos and chips with queso. The queso was alright. The jalapenos were delicious and the accompanying sauce was just so good. My boyfriend got chicken fajitas and loved them. I'm a vegetarian and went with tomatillo enchiladas. Mmmm. Delicious. We finished off the night with churros which were okay. My biggest complaints are that it is chilly in the restaurant, even when we visited in the summer, and that service is a little slow... The waiters/waitresses are not often around. But good food! :)"}
{"text":"It was ok.

The chicken for the quesadilla didn't really look freshly made. It looked like the pre-made chicken strips that can be bought in a grocery store. It was good, but could have been better. 

The margaritas were good with a nice combination of alcohol incorporated into the drink. I tried the raspberry, mixed berry, and plain lime. 

The refried beans were also tasty, and the chips and salsa were very good.

I'll definitely give this place another go!"}
{"text":"I am an avid fan of Mexican and Hispanic food and this place really hits the mark for me! They have the best tacos I've had (I think it has to do with this amazing sauce that they top them with). Their service is quick and amazing and the view of Market Square from the restaurant is beautiful especially if there is something going on in the square! The only downside is that it's a second floor restaurant so you have to walk up a flight of stairs but like I said - the view is well worth it! Even on a busy night service is outstanding and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband & I ate here last night during our trip to Pittsburgh.  I had read online about their cheap happy hour.  We did get here an hour early but decided to sit at the bar and order anyway.  It wasn't busy at 4:00 on a Monday (but then it was rainy and windy outside).  Our bartender/server, Jorge, was just wonderful.  He was very personable and recommended items to us both.  I was going to order the fish tacos with tilapia but he said the mahi mahi tacos were better.  Indeed they were.  The homemade chips and queso were also a great starter.  They have great beer on tap and an extensive liquor selection.

 The restaurant is on the second floor and you can look out the windows at Market Square.  We will definitely come back on a return visit!  Another bartender recommended a breakfast place to us and we are on our way there this morning."}
{"text":"Not the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  But the second worst.  (The worst was El Toro Taco in Homestead, FL.  I actually joined Yelp so I could write a review of that mess.) 

At both places I would have been better opening a can of Old El Paso and eating it cold.

I am STILL angry I spent $27 on absolute cr*p at this dirty place.  And that's the first time I've sw*rn in a Yelp review!

P.S. I only ended up here because I was visiting Pittsburgh.  Ended up downtown, starving, and couldn't get a signal on my iPhone to consult my Yelp app. to help select a place.  I will never go cold turkey again!

P.P.S.  The server was actually very nice.  But how could she have lied to me and told me the food in the restaurant was good?  How could she have even called it food?

P.P.P.S.   I knew from the first bite it would be a mistake. The chips tasted like they were cooked in old oil.  The guacamole was crusted in brown (sent it back).  And the salsa?  Just tasted like good old sodium."}
{"text":"Legit Mexican Eats in an unassuming location & Good service.  We brought in a birthday cake for a suprise B-day and they were OK with that and dropping a sombrero on the birthday girls head while singing to her.  Market Square location is convenient.  Get the corn on the cob.  Get the corn on the cob.  Yeah, I said it twice."}
{"text":"My date and I both had Conchinita Phibil Tacos. We both cleaned our plates.  The (2) tacos were stuffed full, very flavorful, and not too spicy, but did have a zing. They came with beans and rice. Everything was perfectly cooked.
We came in a little after 12 pm, and though it was very busy (and loud), we only waited 10-15 minutes.
We'll be back I'm sure."}
{"text":"Worst mexican I've ever had. \"Truffle\" dip looked regurgitated... no seasoning for meat in enchiladas or tacos... rice looks microwaved... TERRIBLE service!"}
{"text":"Situated one level above Market Square, Las Velas tops my list for go-to authentic Mexican food in the 'burgh. It can be difficult to notice the front door at first glance, but it's worth the search. The entrance is tucked between Diamond Market and the Oyster House. A set of stairs takes you up and up till you reach the restaurant's bar and dining area. 

Frankly, if you don't start your visit with an order of the chips and queso you're missing out. The chips are clearly made in-house and served fresh each day. Pair those with the rich and creamy queso and you have a winning combination. For the main courses, I've tried a variety of the tacos on the menu, my two favorites being the Grilled Chicken Tex Mex style and the Tacos Checandole, which are the marinated pork option. Word of advice, if you have leftover queso add some to your tacos. You do not want that queso going to waste! 

Also, Las Velas margaritas are some of the best. A strawberry margarita on the rocks is my usual order. Though, I've tried the watermelon and raspberry ones on occasion; however, I end up back to the strawberry one by the second round. 

All in all, Las Velas is a great place for lunch (go early), dinner, or happy hour. The service is wonderful and the food is delicious, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The chips and guacamole/salsa are not free, the waiter charge $2.50 for the chips and salsa and then $3.50 for the guacamole. It was disappointing since both the salsa and guacamole tasted mediocre.

I ordered a frozen margarita that was more poorly mixed than one I ordered a month ago. My meal was extremely \"wet\" for lack of a better word. I had a spicy Mahi Mahi dish, which was ok, but not great."}
{"text":"I went here with some coworkers for happy hour and was not so impressed. The restaurant itself has a nice location overlooking Market Square, but the service and food were not great.

We took advantage of the happy hour special on margaritas and those were decent. Everyone enjoyed their drinks, which were huge and pretty strong.

Appetizers are also half-off during happy hour, so we decided to order a bunch to split for dinner. Among the things I tried were the sopecitos; four thick corn tortillas that were topped (one each) with chicken, steak, carnitas, and chorizo. The meat was okay, but the tortillas did not taste fresh. Also, the dish was only lukewarm when served.

I also tried the empanadas which were okay. I ordered them with beef. There really isn't much I can say, they were just bland and \"meh.\"

There were a few other dishes that were not very memorable. The one thing that we all loved were the flautas. I wish we had just gotten several plates of these instead of everything else!

We also had issues with the service. The food took almost an hour (for appetizers!) and one of the dishes was incorrect once it was finally brought out. I sent it back and did not request a replacement, but the incorrect dish was still on my check. I had them remove it but the whole experience was annoying."}
{"text":"Great Queso! It has a nice smokey flavor. The Mango Margarita is a must try if you like fruity drinks. Food is authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"This place is not that great especially considering all the other great Mexican cuisine restaurants I've tried in Pittsburgh. The queso was good, but remember when the waitress asked if you want more queso, it is NOT free. I ordered the hanger steak tacos and it was dry and not flavorful at all, the only thing I will come back for is their margaritas. 
The server knew that I don't like my tacos, so she gave us free dessert. It is nice of them but I wish it could be taken off my bill like many other restaurants will do. I barely ate any, and my boyfriend didn't like it either. I will not come back for their food, maybe their drinks!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. One of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to, hands down. 

In my last review I complained about their slow service but I've been here so many times and they've become a lot faster! 

I used to always order the chicken quesadillas but my new favorite is the chicken enchiladas with red and green sauce! I always order lime cilantro rice and refried beans with it. 

Their queso is amazing as well! 

Their drinks are amazing as well! I love their mango margaritas and the basil agave drink. 

Best Mexican food in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Two Margarita's in and I'm golden.  Golden as a peach and raspberry marg you get!

Order some fresh made chips and salsa and I'm in heaven!  I knowingly had a homemade taco salad for lunch, knowing I would indulge in Mexi fare later that night.  I didn't care, I like to double dip!

Immediately I ordered the chips and salsa...I mean...dah...who wouldn't?  You could tell it was of the homemade chip persuasion.  This wasn't a bag o' tostito's poured out!  We also ordered the gauc.  Thank gawd it didn't come in a puny bowl.  It was a heaping helping of the green stuff!  I was all over that ish!

I ordered the Burrito Isla, which came with cheese, rice, green peppers, grilled onions, salsa and sour cream.  The option included meat but I opted to go veggie tonight.  It was a huge portion.  Factor that in with the huge chip/salsa ratio and you've got a full belly!  

The ONLY issue I had was that it seemed to take a long time between drinks.  Maybe I'm a little overzealous between bevvies...but it's happy hour...I gotta get my drink on!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while visiting downtown as a tourist with my husband. Unfortunately on the night we came things were pretty hectic. They said their food runner called out and they were short staffed, so service was less than great. That said, the food was EXCELLENT. The waiter customized my meal since I was vegetarian. The portion were really big and the prices were great considering it was right in the heart of the city. I personally did not like the chips as I found them to be too greasy but the salsa was yummy. We would visit them again. We appreciated the fact that they told us that the reason service was lacking was because they were down a team member or two. Our waiter apologized profusely. We felt bad for him because he was manning several tables and literally \"running\" to the back to grab food for various other tables. I certainly won't critique them for this, my review is based on their food. They certainly do have good tasting food. The atmosphere is ok, nothing exciting decoration-wise."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great value. A little under staffed on a busy night, but well worth the wait. Mahi tacos are awesome."}
{"text":"Our first trip to Las Velas revealed two things: (1) arrive half an hour early for lunch, or you're going to wait in a long line of people stretching all the way up the stairs; and (2) the food is very good. I'm a chips-and-salsa aficionado, and I thought Las Velas was passable, but not memorable. The food, however, IS memorable. I enjoyed the chicken enchiladas and thought the refried beans were the business. We definitely will visit Las Velas again when we're in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Better Mexican than I've had at other places in the Burgh, but not that special (the Mahi-Mahi tacos are not bad, the rice so-so). The  big disappointment were the watered-down mixed drinks (I went through a 23oz mojito and a captain and diet coke...a total that would have floored me if it'd had anywhere near the amount of alcohol it should have, and the drinks are not cheap either. The atmosphere is cute and looks over Market Square, but I was too miffed about the rip-off to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I have never had a negative experience here!  The portions are large, and the food prices are very reasonable.  Plus, their staff is great!

Drink-wise, their mojitos are delicious!  

Whether you are having a relaxed dinner or a night just sitting at the bar, it is a great place to be!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars. My husband and I wanted to try a new Mexican restaurant in a different environment. We live in the suburbs and traveled over 30 minutes in to the city. We parked, walked a few blocks and arrived 2 hours before they were supposed to close. Both online and on their door they said they were opened until ten. It was eight. We walked in and climbed the many steps up to their restaurant only to be told they were closed. When I said the hours said they were open until ten the man said the kitchen had already cleaned up for the night. HOW UNPROFESSIONAL. Side note: the restaurant smells like mildew. Not a good sign. We went to Emiliano's in the South Side and had great service and great food. Save yourself the aggravation and avoid this place."}
{"text":"I've been here about a dozen times for happy hour drinks, but never food. I can easily see that changing after my tamale excursion. I ordered two vegetable tamales with a side salad and guacamole. Everything was delicious except for the salad. The salad, albeit fresh, was haphazardly thrown onto the plate - huge pieces of peppers and cucumbers that could've afforded to be cut down and no dressing or lime to squeeze atop. 
My friend ordered the tamales as well, but chose one chicken and one veg instead. She said that she wouldn't order the chicken again because it was a little too dry.  Aside from that, she agreed that they were delicious."}
{"text":"If you're going for lunch you have to get there by 11:30 or else you'll wait forever for service and food. The food itself is pretty good and easy to customize and the margaritas are great. If you have a large group be aware that they won't seat you until everyone is present. Even if you get there early it's rarely a quick in and out meal. The refried beans are honestly my favorite part of the meal, I don't eat cheese but my coworker swears by the queso!"}
{"text":"Update - new, well new to me, bartender Cameryn has a really cool and fun personality. Chit chatting while I grabbed lunch was great and a nice change of pace from my rare out of office lunches where I usually read or continue working through endless emails while I eat. 
So not just great food and drink as I've opined before, but a nice side order of personality now comes with lunch at Las Velas. Keep up the great bar you're running there Camryn!"}
{"text":"Soo where do I begin ... Okay well I have to say the chips and salsa were delicious but it seems after this point that things went down hill, I ordered one of those Carona margarita drinks , and I drank about half of it, it was delicious , all of a sudden I take another gulp and I begin to chomp on what I'm assuming is ice- to discover that the \"Ice\" I'm chomping on is quite gritty and um painful, did I just loosen a filling ? Upon spitting it into my hand I realize its GLASS , my guy friend waves down a waiter who feverishly escorts the drink away and comes back with a new one . After this I was just looking forward to my meal, which happened to be gross . The chicken was cold and slimy and they gave me flour tortillas when I specifically asked for corn. The servers were not very attentive and seemed liked they could care less about being there. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We ordered at the bar for take-out off the lunch menu and our order was ready super quick. The food was delicious as always and the lunch menu has generous portions. Tip: Go early because it will get busy."}
