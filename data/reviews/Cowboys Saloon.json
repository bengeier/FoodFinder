{"text":"Went this past weekend for a friends birthday. I ordered the shrimp and grits and after the first bite I knew they were day old grits. Ew. 
If it's 115 degrees outside and you want your Jack Daniels a little chilled, beware. You WILL pay for frozen free water if you request it with \"rocks\"."}
{"text":"Never again will I come to this place.  The food was awful!  I ordered chicken and waffles and it was burnt and cold.  I sent the 1st order back and the 2nd order was worst.  The dance floor is great and music is awesome!  No drinks and no food!!"}
{"text":"Yikes! Talk about getting off to a rough start. 

First of all as a restaurant this place is a mess. It took forever to get seated just to be told we had to hurry and order because the kitchen closes at 10. Which is fine, but it took 20-30 to get a table and if we hadn't ordered our food the first time our waitress came round we would have missed our chance as she almost never came back to check on us. Then they got half the order wrong so my friends had to wait. I ordered the chicken and waffle sliders and they were AWFUL! The friend chicken was burned and hard and over battered and barely edible, the waffles were as rock hard as the table and without the syrup it would have tasted like nothing. Do not order these you will regret it. My friends did like their truffle fries though. And the manager did comp my food which I appreciate.

The dance floor is pretty small, and this place is not a place for dancers like Denim is. It's mostly couples and groups of dudes coming to drink and watch - which is fine if you aren't a serious dancer. The music is okay, the lighting of the unused stage is kind of obnoxious, and again, don't expect room on the dance floor. If you want serious dancing, stick with Denim.

Lastly the service at the bar was pretty bad. You could see the chaos and disorganization and beware they charge more for a double drink than 2 singles so it's not worth it ($7 for a Jameson and ginger single, $19 for a double???). I will say their mule drinks are delicious though...just expect to wait forever to get one.

Definitely not interested in going back here unless things change but I doubt since just opening they're going to get rid of all that \"standing around space\" and expand the dance floor...oh well, so disappointed."}
{"text":"Inconsistent hours that differ from what's posted online and what's posted on the door. A phone number that doesn't work. It really seems like this business is trying to inconvenience people. This is the last time I make any effort to visit either location. The last time I drive all the way out there to discover the doors locked. I'll stick to Denim. It's better anyway."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and after today I can safely say we will be back. I can not comment on the night life, although it does look like it would be fun. The food and service were great. It was happy hour so we decided to order a lot of different items to share. Everything we ordered was fabulous . Pork egg rolls , chicken & waffle sliders, BBQ sampler, nachos and the amazing fresh cornbread. The chef came out to make sure everything was to our liking and our server never left us waiting for anything."}
{"text":"Mike is the manager and is be overly accommodating. All of our needs were met and he was very friendly. Paige was very prompt with our drinks. Best customer service"}
{"text":"Happy hour deals brought us in. Killer shrimp appetizer was under cooked, French fries were cold. Barbecue ribs were room temp and not tasty. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Would post negative stars if I could. We got VIP for $1000. Horrible management and customer service. Dont tell patrons 1 thing and do something else. Then try to get patrons kicked out for it. This type of service and no one will return. Good luck Shady Saloon!"}
{"text":"I really like this bar, however the new DJ they have does not know how to keep the dance floor going. He literally played five line dance songs in a row and continued to play the same line dance songs every hour. Very little danceable music was played, seriously who plays van Halen at a country bar? Change the DJ back to Johnny vela, he knows how to dj!"}
{"text":"Over the top experience! Words do not do it justice! The food and service was amazing. Live music and dancing was a blast. Will be back next weekend for sure!"}
{"text":"Fun place but don't go there for the food.   We had the buffalo blue chicken - it was dry with bad bread.   The ribs were chewy and didn't finish them.   The hamburger was pretty good but not fantastic.   The menu is limited and hard to read.   There is not to much for the healthy eater. 

The country bar part is good and the line dancing would be fun.   Have dinner some place and head over after."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time since Tony Keith's.  What a difference. Friendly and fun staff, food was great.  Had a hamburger and crab chowder.  They have definitely revitalized the place with new management.  Met Rob and he is great. Will definitely be back.  

For family types, be aware it turns into a real bar around 9 at night, and tables will be scarce.  

Looking forward to coming here often."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting Phoenix and decided to try this on a whim since it was close to our hotel. I'm so glad we did! The food was absolutely amazing (the mac and cheese was the best I've had, which is saying something since we're from Wisconsin). The service was a little rocky at the beginning, but they more than made up for the momentary lapse, and it was amazing the rest of the visit. I would absolutely come back next time we're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Very bad service, came for a company lunch and waited for over 45 mins for our food. We were the only table that was occupied and no apologies were given for the unsatisfactory service. Food was good service was overall horrible"}
{"text":"Came out tonight for some country music and I didn't think I was going to be listening to an 80s dance mix all night.. I've been here ALOT and literally the worst DJ ever.  Doesn't play and 2step song ..  Change the DJ and it would be great.  Honestly I rather plug my phone in and play Pandora!"}
{"text":"Came for the line dancing, which is non existence now.Came back based on nights and times that are advertised and no line dancing. Go back to instructor Dee on Wednesday night and the place was a hit. Food is hit or miss depending how busy they are. Drink specials  for happy hour are great deal."}
{"text":"Went to see Joe Nichols last month. (Just created a Yelp). First and foremost the waitress we had was awesome. She was given a very good tip I might add.  I wish I remembered her name. 

However, the establishment / management itself sucks.  What kind of place is out of jäger and a few other COMMON drinks.  I noticed management running around with their heads cut off. They took tables away, then brought them back then took them away within 30 mins. 
Doesn't look like anyone had the ability to lead.   

Also being as it was EARLY 6pm and not having these drinks in stock, a smart manager would have gone to a Costco or something to purchase he alcohol needed. I'm sure they would have still made a profit.  

The food wasn't all that good either.  I liked the fries!!  I hope this place gets on track."}
{"text":"Came there for the first time this weekend, it was great. It is nice to finally have a nice place in the area. The food was awesome and it came out prompt and hot, the service was over the top and we stayed a little later into the night and at 10pm it became a Country Western nightclub."}
{"text":"Went to the new one in Peoria last night. We were very pleased with the evening. Happy hour has great prices on drinks. The sirloin steak was excellent for the reasonable price. Hamburgers were great. Ben was our waiter and did an excellent job. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I really like this place!  We were looking for a good lunch and we found one. The burger with marmalade was out of this world!  (I substituted bacon for pork belly!)
The second trip I tried waffle and chicken sliders - yum!  Husband had shrimp and grits - said it was great. 
Servers were really nice too!  
We will go back!"}
{"text":"Cowboys has some great food and even better drinks happy hour is from 3-7 and all the drinks are half off!!! Such an awesome place to come to and have fun without spending an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"Sucks...we paid 350.00 for vip seats.
.and can't see crap! Management not customer  friendly. ...bad bad bad"}
{"text":"We ate here when it first opened, and recently went back on a Thursday night.  Could not believe how much it had already slipped.  I ordered a beef briscut sandwich.  There was maybe two ounces of beef on a soggy bun.  They have already eliminated fresh cut potato fries from the menu and replaced them with frozen fries.  My wife  had a salad, which was also mainly iceberg lettuce.  Even worse, she ordered a mule, which was very good last time.  This time, they were out of the grapefruit garnish and substituted a lime, which really was a poor flavor combination.  One of our worst meals in quite a while."}
{"text":"A co worker recommended me to try this place out. I went here 3 times and 3 out of 3 times 100% they have got my order wrong. I had to go back twice for them to correct and give me what I asked and paid for. The staff here is totally incompetent. My first experience I ordered chicken and waffles and a salad. I specifically asked them for Italian dressing. Before I left I asked for forks and the girl told me she didn't have syrup or forks. I get home whats not with my order ITALIAN dressing. I took it back and the manager apoligized then gave me a coupon. Oh by the way the manager gave me syrup and forks.

2nd order
Ordered chicken and waffles again. I'm a simple guy. I had syrup and forks in the bag this time. I get home and guess what is with my chicken and waffles order. BACON!!!!! i DONT EAT PORK. The smell almost made me vomit. I had to take it back for them to remake. The girl in the front stated that they have a new staff who is trying to figure out the menu.

3rd order
I figure I cash in on that coupon the manager gave me from the first order they messed up on. I order my usual chicken and waffles and my girlfiend ordered ribs and fries. I specifically stated in my order do not put ANY BACON in my chicken and waffles. My girlfriend gets there to pick up the order and guess whats in my chicken and waffles drum rolllllllllllllll BACON ITS BACON. She had to wait there while they remake my order. I swear to GOD I am NEVER going here again. I'd rather drive a hour away before they get anymore money from me."}
{"text":"Wow! What an awesome place! Great food. Delicious drinks. Amazing food. Huge dance floor. Nice outdoor seating area. I love the atmosphere and energy the place has. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Understaffed, food was really good, service was slow. We had a jalapeño margaritas and a couple draft beers. Shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles, and Cowboy Eggrolls were extremely tasty. If you fail at quality of service, the bar is set for a rough experience."}
{"text":"This place is new and just so much fun!  The remodel from the old place is just really cool.  Very western but with a modern look.  The burgers are huge, juicy and just great!  They have a good happy hour, fun band and a neat riding bull.  A must to check out!"}
{"text":"Worst place I've been in a long time. Sat down at a table with a group of 6. Took a while for the server to come ask for drinks. You would think a big group would get decent service. Took even longer to get water cups. Yet no water for the cups. Bar tender was rude to one of the people in our group that had to ask him for a pitcher of water. Would've had more drinks if we were treated better. Lost 6 customers and will not recommend this place to anyone. Would've also put no stars if I could"}
{"text":"There's only one bartender, a young brunette, that has fast service; the rest of them make me wait a really long time even though I tip well. The d.j. they used to have, a short older guy, was not bad, at least he played requests, but the young guy there on 10/22/16 was terrible. Didn't play anything that could be danced to and wouldn't play a request."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffle sliders in my whole life. Vic the bartender makes the best southern mango ever! Had such a good time dancing on their amazing dance floor I'll definitely be back every weekend.
If you go definitely get the calamari and bacon jam bruschetta!"}
{"text":"We had happy hour here and it was just okay."}
{"text":"Growing up in the south I consider myself a connoisseur of good bbq. The bbq here was at best alright, nothing fancy. It would have been much more manageable if the price wasn't ridiculous. My wife and I both ordered an entree and we split one side, she had a mixed drink and I had a beer. All total for our beer, drink, bbq, and mashed potatoes was over 60 bucks. I've paid less than 15 for way better bbq including drinks. The atmosphere was good and I can't complain about the restaurant itself. The setup is a little weird though because the bar stretches into the dining area so they're a bunch of drunk idiots walking around the dining room. But go for the ambience and drinks. Do yourself a favor and go to honeybears or somewhere better for cheaper bbq, then go here afterwards for drinks. You'll save yourself a ton of money."}
{"text":"Let's start with the food. I have to say that I am impressed every time I eat here. No, it's not Charlie Trotter's, but for bar food, it's way above average. The grits are some of the best I have ever eaten. Pork belly was really good, meaty, not too much fat. Burgers are pretty amazing. You may want to split it as they are huge. One thing I like about their food is that it is not over salted. So be prepared to add your own salt.

Happy hour deals are excellent. Highly recommended.

Wait staff is friendly and fast. I can see things slowing down as the night progresses and get's busy, but that is not their fault. When we have been there on a weekday, the waitstaff is dressed pretty respectfully, but on weekends or concert nights they show a lot more skin (not that I'm complaining). Just keep that in mind if you plan to bring the kiddos.

Concerts: we have been to 3 concerts there and really enjoy the small venue, intimate stage, energetic crown, dancing. The only down side is that it is *very* loud. Bring ear plugs and you will enjoy it a little more. If you go, don't be intimidated by the \"country\" crowd. Everyone is very nice.

A couple of thinks are keeping Cowboys from 5 stars: 1) concerts do not start on time and this is a big problem, tickets say they start at 5p and usually don't come on until 10 or 11, be honest with us and just tell us, and I watch a lot of people leave because of this, 2) the women bathrooms run out of TP *very* early on, and the ridiculous bathroom attendants that take all the hand towels and then make you feel bad for not tipping them for a towel to dry your hand is *not* cool."}
{"text":"Pack your boots and swing dancing flannels and get ready for a bull-riding, great dancing, drinkin' bourbon kind of night! 

The bar is fantastic, their live music on Saturday night is AMAZING, and the swing dancing is so lively. I can't wait to come back to this place with my boots on! 

If you're on high street you've got to stop in here for a round. Especially if you really like your date because everyone is kissin like they're at a southern backyard party. 

My only laughable moment was when I asked the DJ to play a George Strait song and gave him a tip for it (the tip jar was empty)...he told me it was the next song on and an hour later it never played. 

Tip:  They don't have any menu items without animal products. Nothing against them, but I was definitely ready to chow down on a hearty southern salad, veggies, or a baked potato. The waitress was super sweet, apologized, and we resumed dancing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food I had the Longhorn burger and the wife had a Ribeye steak, both dinners where great staff was on top of it the kids dinner was a fair price for what they got. The grilled corn was some of the best corn I had at a restaurant. We came on a Friday night and they had live music so that made the night even better, only negative is the parking situation."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's been great each time.  Staff is super friendly and had a great atmosphere!
Food was amazing each time and drinks were delicious.
I'll be going here for my birthday in a few days. 
Great Groupon deals also!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome ! From the minute we walked in our waitress Victoria welcomed us and made sure we were well taken care of ! The acoustic guitar player was amazing and we throughly enjoyed his singing. The bottomless brunch was worth every penny and we will definitely be regulars there for Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"Food is delicious.  Great happy hour. From 2 to 7pm with majority of appetizers and drinks half off. Service with a smile, and great location.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Line dancing for kids on Wednesday nights!!  7-730pm. So much fun!  Food was great! Fast service too. The chicken gumbo is delish."}
{"text":"Well it's Thursday night and not very busy yet. Our waitress took our drink order over 20 minutes ago and the bar tender had to deliver our drinks. We are missing half of them as well as the water we have been waiting for. The waitress has never come back. I had to go to the bar to ask for the ice for my drink and the lime that never came as well as the sodas for our Designated drivers. The bartender was not so helpful and told me that he would let someone know that we still needed drinks and water. There are many other servers standing around talking. Not good and I will not be back. Bummed and they are not very friendly."}
{"text":"My first visit to the place was on a Friday night.  We enacted to go to a new place.  So we decided to check out Cowboy Saloon. The place seemed like it was busy, but once you realize how massive it is, it wasn't that packed.

There was a live 1 man band playing some country music.  They have a number of TVs with sports.  We were promptly seated in a booth.  Unfortunately, the booth was a little dark for my liking.  

As far as the food, I was pleasantly surprised.  The hamburgers were hearty and done well.  We also had a chicken salad which was also tasty.  The service could be improved on as our waitress would go missing for long periods of time.

Overall I would return."}
{"text":"First visit here since they opened about a month ago. At this point I like the place, despite the fact that I'm not into country. 
The pros about this place is lots of great seating for groups, a huge bar, a dance floor, a bull riding station, nice new clean restrooms and good happy hour specials. 
The cons, family night on Wednesdays (lol well to me since I'm not a kid person...but perhaps a pro for you. Kids under 12 eat free I believe), the first TWO beers I ordered were out...boo tisk tisk CS that is a fail. We had an issue with one of our appetizers but the manager apologized for the issue so that was good on their part. 
Overall I'm very happy to see this place open and with lots of customers on the mid week night. Perhaps this heavy metal rock girl will take a chance on the dance floor learning some line dancing some day soon. Keep it up CS!"}
{"text":"Getting used to this spot as locals and trying out the menu.  First off.  Lobster corn dogs. Not a huge fan, sounds better than what is delivered.  Was expecting a lobster skewer in a thin batter, got a lobster mush in a LOT of batter.  If this is your cup of tea ala grits and poutine, more power to ya. 

Had the ribs, they were awesome. Hamburger is great, can't go wrong here. 

Service was great, very attentive and fun! We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"First things first, correct the hours to reflect when you are actually open. Drove by this place to go to another restaurant because you said you are not open until 3pm. 

We went for lunch around noon. Had the brisket sandwich with Mac and cheese and an order of wings which me and my husband shared, all great. The Pickles are not homemade, they are Kosher dill Pickles. They are my favorite but not a traditional \"homemade Pickle\". 

32oz beer was $8 which is very pricy, (miller lite) but I guess reasonable for the area? 

Overall a nice meal, great service and great ambiance. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and loved everything. Chicken & Waffles were amazing and Shrimp & Grits were to die for. Then we had some mason jar pie..... Strawberry Shortcake = AWESOME!!!

My wife and I will be going back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, great atmosphere and awesome drinks! Definitely worth the visit. Happy hour 3-7 half off alcohol even their specialty drinks!"}
{"text":"I experienced pros and cons this evening. Pros were that this was a laid back atmosphere that I could take my kids on a weeknight. They have very long booths that are very kid friendly and I was happy my kids enjoyed their meal. Cons could be specific to the evening. They didn't seem to have any food on the menu available other than chicken? Our server said food was not delivered so no seafood, fries, bison burger, beef or turkey patties. So basically a lot of the menu was not available. Actually this really wouldn't have been an issue for us since we do like chicken but it was confusing bc our waitress couldn't really tell us what we could order and had to go back and forth a bit to figure out what they had in stock. I think extreme customer service may have been more helpful at this point if the server or gen manager from the beginning directed our attn specifically to the items that were available on the menu. They did get an order mixed up that we did have to send back and waitress did take a soda to fill and forgot to bring one back. I'm going to assume they were having an \"off\" day but I really wish general manager at least addressed these issues as it was beyond weird. Mainly our issues were these so could be related to chaos of that day, not getting food delivery? 
I will say everyone was friendly, decor was fun and went well with the theme. Food we did get tasted as described and filling portions. Loved the cheesy grits."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town! Can't beat the half priced drinks (premium wells?! Smirnoff, Bacardi, Jose, Jack, etc.) draft beer and appetizers!!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent server - very attentive, fast, and responsive. The \"family night\" line dancing was definitely geared toward adults, but our toddler loved trying to follow along anyway (we never did see the advertised balloon artist). The food was awful. The cornbread was under-cooked, the chili had a gritty texture and bad flavor, the kids' mac n cheese tasted gritty and microwaved (our non-picky child refused to eat it, because \"it icky.\"), the fries tasted like leftovers from yesterday that were microwaved, the burger with egg was okay. Our waiter was great. The manager came to check on us, explained they've only been using the new menu for two weeks, and said he'd take care of the bill - he took 20% off the total. :/ We definitely won't be back, which is too bad because the place seemed like it could have had a cool vibe."}
{"text":"We were there last Saturday night (10/1/16) for a small birthday party - dinner and dancing. They were out of prime rib, brisket and sirloin burgers. Then they ran out of coconut rum and the only other rum they had was Bacardi.  Amazing that a restaurant runs out of primary dishes on a Saturday night and a bar that big had such limited Rum choices. We tried to give our server the benefit of the doubt, but at the end of the night the consensus of the group was that she was not a good server. We liked the atmosphere at the Cowboys on Northern, but they too ran out of primary supplies (beer) on a Saturday night a month prior. We were giving them a second chance, but they failed us. Good luck - maybe they will figures out how to order enough supplies so they don't run out."}
{"text":"I felt like I was back at Toby Keith's and that is not a good start.  Walk in and see 6 girls standing at the hostess stand looking annoyed with everyone that walks in.

We asked to sit at a high top table and all one of the girls said was you want table 90?  Ww both thought, are we supposed to know the table numbers then we realized, we were dealing with young girls who had not clue.

We were seated, reviewed the menu for drinks and sat and sat and sat for 10 minutes and no one said a word to us.  We both said, hey this is just like it was at Toby Keiths and look how long that place lasted.  We left, never to return here again.

The menu, lacking in every way.  I REALLY had to look to find something that even sounded yummy and I was HUNGRY!  Needless to say, didn't feel like we missed out on anything leaving here and heading over to Marleys at Desert Ridge where we were greeted at a hostess stand by 2 young ladies who greeted us and smiled at us.  Then we were taken to a table outside and treated like - well paying customers!  We had drink orders taken within minutes and said, wow, Cowboys Saloon should send their staff over here for some training.

I give this place 6-8 months just like I did with Toby Keiths and I was right on with that place!!!"}
{"text":"Rip off alert. They claim to have big name stars perform but it's a con job.  Tickets say that Joe Nichols starts @ 5. Internet then says 7. By 11 the cover band they have \"opening\" can't stall any more  I left after 5 hours and never saw Joe Nichols."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, nice place to see bands up close. We like to celebrate birthdays here easy to get a table just call ahead of time."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for this place and shortly thereafter, they closed their doors. Very unhappy. Worse than that, Groupon falsely told me that they had reopened. The phone number never worked and after two trips to the restaurant, they had never reopened.  :-("}
{"text":"Fun place overall. The food was really good, the service was not as good. We got a great deal on Groupon- $30 for dinner for two including an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. We made it a date night. For the appetizer, we had chips and guac and it was really good. The guac was fresh and had small pieces of tomato in it which gave it a zesty taste. The chips were very fresh, not too salty, and held their crunch. So far so good. When the waitress came to take our order, she did not ask me what side I wanted with my shrimp skewers. I had to chase her down to tell her. I asked her if there were meat in the sides and she said no. She also asked me how I wanted my shrimp cooked which was just weird. Shrimp? I said um the regular way? So my dinner comes out and there is meat in the rice which sucked. Meat (red meat, pork, turkey, etc) makes me sick. So I had to complain and it was a pain in the butt and I could tell the waitress meant well she was just inexperienced. We were too full for dessert so we brought some pie home. Also very good. I liked the decor and the vibe. I will definitely come again to dance and have some drinks. Don't order the drinks full price here, $12 each which is crazy. So just come on one of their special nights and they have tons of specials. Saw $1 premium wells for ladies and stuff so that is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Came here to tonight for a local opening! Drinks and food were amazing, staff friendly and some seriously amazing music! I know for sure that Cowboys Saloon will be my new local hangout!"}
{"text":"Food tastes like it was cooked, or microwaved in an old boot. Service was non-existent."}
{"text":"When walked in the greeter wasn't very nice and then she just sat us down wherever how it felt like, but the waitress Alley more then made up for it she was very friendly and right on the ball with everything and was very helpful on the food and just so cheerful it was amazing service and the food for the price was great as well and very well prepared have to say was just great experience. The atmosphere was very up beat and clean and we intend on going back again and make regular place."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, the staff was super friendly and attentive and the there were some fun dishes. I can't wait to go back for some dancing!"}
{"text":"You guys have a great concept going on and the food is really good. But you need new bartenders. I've been here about 6-7 times and the bartenders have been rude and take forever to get drinks/closing out a tab.  If you guys want to stay open I suggest you hire new people behind your bar."}
{"text":"I went there to meet friends around 10 :30 on Thursday, ladies night. Got a tiny red solo cup. Didn't use it, it's just for well drinks.... Uggh. BUT they do have Voss in glass bottles! Love it! 

Happy atmosphere, fun dancing, weird food. Not recommending the egg rolls."}
{"text":"The first time I went it was awesome. I told some friends, and took them their. Bad experience all around. The appetizers were good. The dinner came and the food on the bbq platter was not hot, just warm, the wrong side sent out with it. The hamburger was warm, not hot. Then we were charged for 4 drinks, and only had 2.  We asked if it was happy hour and was told yes, we ordered 2 drinks, and when we were going to order a 2nd round, we were told they were not happy hour drinks. Told waitress they were the last time, and she checked with manager and said ok, for these 2 only. We told waitress our bill was wrong, she brought over manager and when he asked what the problem was, I showed him, and he said you had 4 drinks, I said , no, we had only 2. He says, oh, and walks away. What type of a manager does this. No apology for the inconvenience, for the bad food, or for the mistake. My friends said that was their first and last time going there. I too, will never be back, and will make sure if anyone asks about this place, I will tell them. If they keep that stuff up, I can't see them being in business for long."}
{"text":"Decided to meet friends here for a night out, turned out to be ladies night! (Which is great, $1 premium wells, minus additional) however the SECOND it's over the bartender will stop serving based on those prices no matter how long you've been standing there waiting. It's a nice place, just needs to work on their prices and honoring ladies night no matter how long you've been waiting."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night, first time there. Awesome band. Excellent DJ......Dee......really got the crowd out on the dance floor during the bands breaks! Food was superb, and the drinks on point! Nothing watered down here! Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I was excited to try this place out after hearing multiple radio ads. I made a reservation for 5...but when we showed up no reservation existed. The service was even worse. Our server didn't know ANYTHING about alcohol, beers on tap, etc ( and this is a bar for crying out loud). We came in at 730PM on a Saturday night and they were already out of Blue Moon. When I asked our server what other beers were on tap she had no clue. Then, as we left the girl at the door told us \"I would ask you to come in but you clearly have people in your group who are not 21\" This rubbed me the wrong way....everyone in or party was 21 and up AND we were just drinking at your establishment. NO MANNERS, TERRIBLE SERVICE, NEVER GOING BACK. This place won't last...."}
{"text":"This is my first bad review ....I'm sad to report. We waited over a half hour to be seated...that's expected on a Friday night but it turned out we were overlooked to be seated. Once we were seated we waited a good 15 minutes....no one had yet come to our table. Additionally we had previewed the menu online and it was not the same when we got there...we could've lived with it. The lack of service caused us to walk out. High Street is a trendy, pretty area & we were looking forward to trying a new place to dine...too bad it was a bummer :("}

Ps. Happy hour 3pm-7pm 1/2 drinks and select nibbles (killer deal) $2 domestics, can't beat that."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. They advertise that Joe Nichols will be performing here, doors open @ 5 well it's 11pm and there's no site of him and the lousy \"cover band\" they out on to stall out is still dragging on. 

People are leaving in droves talking about how ridiculous the whole experience is. 

Don't go here and don't see Joe Nichols."}
{"text":"Not good!  Second time there. Pork belly was dry and tough. French fries were soggy and tasteless."}
{"text":"I stopped in about two weeks ago sat down at the bar met a really nice bartender named Kenny, he knows his trade very well. Awesome drink specials and food specials all week-long.  Came in to check out happy hour between 3-7, I be leave on Thursday  (by the way line dancing at 6).  Happy Hour specials were great, wonderful munchies specials and drink specials.  Great to country roots atmosphere,  a true saloon in the modern since of the word.  This is no dive bar, honestly my fiance loved that about this location.  We split the egg roll app, On point!  My Triple Threat sandwich highly recommend, and my girl loves her prime rib.  If you hadn't tried this site out yet I highly recommend bringing in friends for weekend nights or family for a nice lunch.  

P.s. families keep in mind that Wednesday's, with the purchase of an entree for adults, kids eat free,  from the kids menu.
And for the 25 to 35 people like myself, half-price Burgers on Monday."}
{"text":"Maybe leaning to 4 because I am comparing it to the previous Toby Keith's disaster.  CS brings a lot more attention to detail in decor, menu and especially service. Nevertheless, I could still do without the gang of girls all standing around the hostess stand and front door.

While they are still working out a few minor opening kinks, I think they are off to a great start and hope that they can stay for a long time. Minor feedback about menu:  would love to see more small plates/apps (even bar staples like nachos and wings). Also, don't brag too much about this chips....quite average."}
{"text":"Prices are good, service was great. We went in for an early dinner and the place was quiet. Server was knowledgeable about the selection of beer. My husband and I ordered two appetizers, the shrimp and the nachos. It was very basic and nothing to really write home about. I would likely go back if I wanted to just hang out with some friends and have few drinks. Place is pretty big. Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"First off on this update:  food was still great and our waitress was quite good!  What wasn't was that this fun place was in the middle of being sold and all the fallout showed.  My husband wanted a tap beer b/f happy hour was over.  They were out of it (we were there 2 hours after they opened).  We both ordered the same meal as our 1st visit, but the portions were a LOT smaller.  For me that was fine as I took 1/2 of mine home.  But for hubby, last time he was so full that he used his for work lunch the next day-this time no such luck.  Same $$ but a lot less. our calamari appe was still really good but the sweet peppers that topped it the first time were now absent.  And the dessert that came w/ our groupon?  There were 3 choices on the menu and one of them weren't available.  My husband wanted to take it home.  They ran out of containers for the ice cream so they put the entire dessert into a take out container whip cream, ice cream and the fried oreos.
This meant that even after holding it gingerly for the 25 min ride home, the hot cookies melted everything.
The waitress was a delight and tried her best to make sure we were happy, as was the gentleman serving as the host-but it was kind of sad that they were out of several entrees, to go boxes and portions cut in our 3 month absence. We understand that they're in the middle of new owners but they should still realize that this hurts their wait staff's ability to have tips and our going there a 3rd time.  As well as recommending them!"}
{"text":"Food was great, server was really nice but it took forever to get our food. When we arrived there was only two other tables but it still took 35 minutes to get our appetizer.  Atmosphere is fun. Bull riding is a plus. Happy hour drinks are a steal of a deal. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I would never have picked a place like this to go on my own but I bet if Country is your thing you will think this is the place to be. I am so glad to see High street get going finally. A cool little area of north Scottsdale to hang out at. 

If you eat here you might consider sharing everything since they give you a lot of food. I am writing this the next day and I still have a food coma. Ha! I got the burger which was good and huge. Not the best burger I have ever had but tasty. They mixed the meat here so it is a beef and pork mixed. I did not like the fries at all. I should have sent them back since they were soggy and cold but I pick my battles when I eat out. 

The folks I ate with had the blue chicken sandwich and tenderloin and they said they were both excellent. The corn bread was very average and nothing to write home about. Although the jam and butter served with it were fun! To be fair the menu is kind of eclectic for a cowboy place. They have some odd add ons like lobster corn dogs, and Fried Green Tomato Caprese Salad so it looks like you can find something to eat besides typical Cowboy Food. 

I enjoyed the historical Arizona decor and pictures. I actually bumped a three star food place to a four because of the environment. I am not a country type of gal but the place is fun! They have a bar and a huge dance floor. They even give dance lessons. Hey this Rock and Roll gal even though that was cool. I loved watching the kids dance. I guess Wednesday is family night. I think kids eat free or something. As long as they place some other songs besides CANDW every now and again I might even hit the dance floor some night.

I have to admit the service was a bit slow but not horrible. Maybe this is really a three and a half star review but go ahead and check it out and see for yourself. Lots of energy here to pick you up after a stressful day."}
