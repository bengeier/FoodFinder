{"text":"Great food, the curry was incredible!! Portions could be bigger though, but good experience overall. Nice staff."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Thai food.  This place is ok. The flavors were good.  We ordered the sea food Tom Yum soup. It was good but not as spicy as ordered. We ordered spring rolls, but we got 4 small eggrolls instead which were tastless(almost as if they were frozen). Ordered sea food dish. Flavor was good. Also Green curry chicken. We thought we ordered plenty of food for 2 people but portions were small. White rice was extra apparently. We got one small bowl of rice to share.  I probably would not come again. For nearly $50, i feel they are more on stingy side.  The place was empty. Only one other couple eating yet it took them a long time just to get the order."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST THAI FOOD EVER! I love Thai food, and I keep an eye out for any place I haven't tried. Thai Pepper is BY FAR the best! The food is always prepared properly, and you will notice the quality ingredients. They have some plaque directly from Thailand certifying their authenticity and quality.... I thought it was a joke... but now I know why no other Thai restaurants in the GTA have one... they aren't in the same league.  The decor is basic, so maybe not a place for a formal dinner or a first date... but the food is primo. Another comment I would make is that I think the owner does everything, poor guy is running around like a mad man. I've seen his family there a few times, but he needs more help to make things run smoother. Regardless he is always courteous and has a smile on his face. Those are just small details... main thing is... THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS!!! My favourite place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"I just came back from Thailand, and it is a true food paradise; the food was just next level compared to everywhere else I've been.  Unfortunately, Thai restaurants in the GTA absolutely suck.  Most of them are Chinese-run, and as as Thai as your neighbourhood Burger King.    Thai Pepper is run by actual Thai people, so the food is much, much better than other \"Thai\" (they need the air quotes) places.    Is it as good as Thailand?  Not even close.  But it is the closest thing in the west end of the GTA, and the people are very nice, truly deserving of your patronage.    I'd recommend the spicy basil noodles with beef; delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant had some solid food at a reasonable price. This was my first time going and I ordered a curry pad thai. Came to just over $10 for a full Styrofoam container. It was heavy. And it was absolutely delicious. Came with chicken and shrimp. Full of flavor.  Definitely going back. Solid food. Can't wait to try something else"}
{"text":"Wonderful caring owner, a small quaint place thai place. Looks nice. Food was very good. A definite if in the area!!"}
{"text":"who would believe that brampton would have the best and most authentic thai food restaurant in the GTA. The restaurant has a great ambiance and run by the nicest Thai gentleman. If the restaurant is busy do not expect fast service, it is a family run place that sometimes cannot keep up with demand and they will not sacrifice the quality of their food because you are in a rush.  The Green curry is amazing and I also recommend the Pad Thai. For desert go with the deep fried banana with ice cream, it's the perfect end to a great meal."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good service. Hot and sour soup is phenomenal! I usually call ahead for takeout ready in 10-15. The vibe is very mellow as it is tucked away in a semi industrial area. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Great Thai Food. Everything is awesome. The only thing I wish was different is that they usually overcook the noodles in the Pad Thai. I don't usually get Pad Thai so it's not a big deal for me.  Update - I asked them about the Pad Thai and they said the noodles are that way because they are made fresh, which makes sense. Still prefer it a little more firm, but good to know that is the reason."}
{"text":"Did a yelp search for thai food in the area and I found myself here.  I was accompanied with 2 teenage girls and coming from an amusement park we were famished. We ordered the Thai ice tea and thai iced coffee which was perfect and refreshing. Chicken satay and fried tofu which was great and the sauce they served with it even better. We ordered chicken fried rice, pad thai, and BBQ beef. The chicken fried rice is very homemade-ish we loved it. It's a lot more wet than Chinese fried rice so it looks different than what people are use to. BBQ feels like home cooking and the pad thai was so good we ordered another one. Will come back when in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai outside of Bangkok I've ever had, we've gone multiple times and although there's a chance you'll have a good wait for your food you have to remember it's a family run business, it's probably the same chef who makes your dish every time, not just anyone, which means the food is consitenly delishous and made with pride."}
{"text":"Was craving some Pad Sew, and looked for the closet place around me  This place showed up, had surprisingly good reviews..  Ordered the :  Beef noodle: was absolutely disgusting, tasted like the ingredients that were put in were rotten, mushy noodles ..threw it in the garbage after the first bite  Deep fried chicken wings: tasty..had a garlic/savoury flavour..but very greasy/soggy  Spicy beef: decent..There were only about 12-13 little tiny morsels of tough beef pieces..the rest was green beans and bamboo shoots..flavoured with coconut, and basil  Food barely has any flavour..it's heavily salted..needless to mention the rotten tasting food. I'll never come back again and don't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the food. Strange considering the great reviews. We visited this afternoon and were greeted by this gentleman who apparently also the server, cook, greeter etc. It would have been great if he had a professional to recommend dishes to us. We asked if he could recommend something but he was not great at communicating that to us. The food lacked flavor and too much salt in the Tom yum soup. It could also be just an off day for this place. I strongly recommend the owner to hire someone trained to be a good server. Also please help guide the first timers."}
{"text":"Nice little hideaway. Clean space.  Food is fresh and feels homemade. Staff is friendly and helpful. Chicken wings are not the best we ever had but everything else was good.  (Shrimp in green Curry, Chicken grapow all good. )"}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch and was impressed, overall.  The owner/host/waiter was quite reserved at first, but when we engaged him in conversation, he turned out to be pretty funny.  There was only one other table of two occupied when we arrived, then a party of 9 showed up, but he handled it all with aplomb. Before talking about the food I should mention an hilarious event that transpired. After the first table left, whist he was busy with us and the large party, two women walked in and pulled an absolute classic that must drive restaurants crazy. There were about 9 or 10 other set tables, but of course they made a beeline for the dirty table that had just been vacated. When the owner came out and asked them to pick any other table because he was too busy to clean that one, they got so offended. They wanted to argue about it, but he just turned around to get some food from the kitchen and they finally, resentfully, moved. What is it with some people?  The food: Several reviews suggested the portions were small and we were hungry, so we ended up ordering too much. The portions are a perfectly reasonable size. Appetizer platter: This was the least satisfactory part of the meal. Lots of deep-fried stuff and some OK dipping sauces. Decent, but not outstanding, other than the fresh chicken roll. Papaya salad: Fresh veggies and chunks of papaya in a spicy dressing...excellent. Red curry beef: Tender slices of beef, peppers and bamboo in a very, very peppery broth. Sumptuous. I love spicy food, but I'm pretty sure it would be too hot for 80% of Canadians. It had three peppers next to it on the menu, and that means really fiery, so be aware. Curried Pad Thai: My wife asked for very spicy and she had a hard time with the heat, but she loved the textures and flavours. I wolfed down what she couldn't handle. Again, excellent.  All in all, a fine lunch. Including two pops, tax and a 20% tip it was almost $60, which isn't exactly cheap, but you get what you pay for...usually. I'll be back."}
{"text":"A quaint Thai dine-in offering authentic taste:  One of the first experiences of eating out in Brampton and what a good experience it was. I started by ordering chicken satay on skewers with sweet sauce which got me warmed-up. Then, I ordered a barbeque chicken with drunken stirfry noodles. Chicken was cooked proper and barbequed to perfection with sauce on side. Noodles had abundunt veggies and chicken.  Price for 2 : 26$ incl. taxes Overall experience : Thumps up!!"}
{"text":"I usually get two things here, curry (green or red) and pad Thai. Both are delicious! Take out portions are generous. This is one of my go to places. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but it wasn't really amazingggg or the best Thai food I've ever had.   My husband and I got the Thai basil fried rice with chicken and the chicken drunken noodles. They were both good. The rice was flavored well and The noodles were OK but nothing spectacular.  Maybe it was just an off day I mean again it was not bad just nothing I would ever remember."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times as it's a local spot for Thai food for me.  The only thing I've ever gotten here was the yellow curry, so that's what I'm basing my review on.  In the past 2-3 times I've gotten takeout, the yellow curry was delicious.  The texture wasn't too runny not too chunky/thick.  I've really enjoyed it.  However, I finally decided to dine in and of course, ordered the yellow curry.  It wasn't quite the same.  Maybe it was just me but I felt like it was not quite up to par as my past yellow curries here.  Despite this, I will return.  I would like to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"This was the first time at this restaurant and I admit, I had high hopes, since I really don't think that Brampton has a decent Thai restaurant. Sadly, I have to say my opinion hasn't changed. Mediocre at best, overcooked noodles, although I asked for spicy and got spicy. Also I'm pretty sure there were 2 people (the cook and the guy working the front) working, so the wait for take out was very long.  I'm not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great variety of food! Good service and very yummy food!!! The noodles in pad Thai Are so fresh, but the portion is smaller than average in case you decide to share."}
{"text":"I had the pad Thai and it was pretty good.  Only got takeout but everyone seemed friendly when I was ordering and waiting for my food.  I will try this place again."}
{"text":"My first time here today. Have been wanting to come here for a while and sadly, the last two times I've tried, they were closed.  Today was the day I was going to get lucky but when I arrived the place was empty at 12:40pm. That took me a little by surprise having seen all of the yelp reviews before. Figured this place be packed! Well, it wasn't and while I thought about leaving for a second, I am glad I stayed. I love Thai food and especially when it's spicy. I e tried their Drunken Chicken Noodle dish that was phenomenal!!! A little small for a big guy like myself, but most excellent flavors.  This dish makes me want to come again soon and to try something else on their very good menu."}
{"text":"After reading all of the previous reviews about the food here, I decided that I would give this place a try. Boy was I happy! The food was amazing! I only ordered two dishes, however those were the two best dishes I've had in such a long time at a Thai restaurant. I ordered the Pad Thai which comes with chicken and shrimp, the pumpkin soup and some peanut sauce on the side. The Pad Thai was delicious! It was juicy, a bit saucy (not dry at all, just the way I like it) and  hot- full of flavor. I added the Thai peanut sauce on top and it was now a holiday! The sauce was perfectly made and had bits of crunchy peanuts mixed in- Yum!But the \"pièce de résistance\" was the pumpkin soup. Man oh man was I happy I ordered this! Creamy and slightly spicy and just scrumptious! It was probably the best pumpkin soup I've ever tasted. The only reason why they don't have a perfect five stars, was that the gentleman who took my order wasn't really friendly or attentive. He just listened, took my order and walked away. The next time I really saw him was when he put the bill in front of me on the counter which of course I knew was mine. As soon as I paid, I only heard a very soft \"thank you\" at the end of our transaction. I would say the interior of the place is very outdated and definitely in need of an upgrade, however looked very clean. I will be back to try other dishes and if they were as good as my first experience, it's going to be a pleasure to add this Thai place to my restaurant repertoire!"}
{"text":"My local spot in Brampton for great Thai food, in an unlikely location. Some things are a little spicy for me but I always love the flavors. Can't go wrong with their coconut curries and shrimp dishes.  I am disappointed that there usually is nobody else there when I am there though -- because I really hope they stay in business.  I guess most of the local yuppie clientel would rather eat the Turtle Jacks next door, or eat shawarmas all day.  Ugh."}
{"text":"The place looks cozy, nothing special about it.  The food is in good portion and the taste is full of flavour.  I don't know what real, authentic Thai food is so I don't know if it is meant to have such a strong yellow curry taste. The other places I've been to are more subtle, so I guess if you enjoy heavy curry taste, this place will suit you.  The service was alright, I guess.  We were there for lunch on a weekday and we were the only ones around (2 of us).  I found that the water they served smelled and tasted funny also, so I would suggest you order anything BUT water for your refreshment.  I wouldn't say it was a bad experience, but I definitely will not be going back there, nor will I suggest anyone to try it."}
{"text":"Did a take-out order of Pad Thai.  It was alright, nothing special.  Place was clean and there was only one server/host the day I went, was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, didn't really expect to find a decent Thai place in Brampton.  Prices are slightly more than at other Thai restaurants but the taste makes up for it. Every dish that we have ordered has been good to date. Definitely give it a go if you want actual Thai food and not what Thai Express passes off as Thai food."}
{"text":"Great food, the pad thai and curry pad thai are great options. Portion sizes are good, wait staff is friendly. The flavor is authentic and not greasy. I would definitely go back and try other options."}
{"text":"Hit this place again and had a lovely feast.  The satays were very good and tasty. Crispy on the outside and tender inside. The Basil chicken was great with a little heat and tasty. The chart chicken was good, sweet but good. So I'm still happy with this place."}
{"text":"I just wanted to update my post because this place really deserves it. Their food is always consistent taste wise and their customer service is as well.   I've ordered 20x since last posting and I haven't been disappointed once. This will continue to be my go to place for great authentic Thai Food."}
{"text":"The Thai Pepper is a hidden gem and definitely the best restaurant in Brampton.  The owner is extremely hospitable and serves the most authentic and flavorful Thai food I've ever had outside of Thailand.   A good friend and business associate that spent half a year in Thailand agreed with my assessment that The Thai Pepper is the best Thai experience outside of Thailand.   The red curry beef is my personal favourite. Enjoy a relaxing lunch or treat yourself to a special dinner you won't soon forget. You will crave the Thai Pepper soon after leaving."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night, and was overall pretty happy. The owner was a sweet man from Southern Thailand and we chatted for quite a while about Thai politics.   The coconut chicken soup was delicious, and the calamari was amazing. The pad Thai was okay, but the shrimp wasn't as fresh as it could've been, which was a little offputting for me. The red curry was delicious, and the basil beef also really good.  Overall good, I will be back. But won't be ordering any shrimp."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Thai food.  Mango salad is really good.  The dishes that are spicy are good... so I am told by my dining guest.  However, I cant eat spicy and my dish was a bit more on the bland side.  The dining area is very outdated.  It is clean and the guy server (i think owner) was nice and attentive.  If you like Thai food... this is a good place as Brampton is limited."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate how negative some comments were when I have been coming here for years now and the food and service has always been amazing. Trust me-- I don't drive for 40 mins for mediocre food. Haha.  I'm in love with the Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, and Basil Chicken Fried Rice. They're delicious and addictive. Every time I come here I always order those three, and occasionally the Tom Yum Soup. I also recommend the Green Curry Chicken-- I've took it home after being unable to finish my meal and it was still great.   The service may be a little slow but that's what you should expect if you want a fresh meal.. if you can't wait for the real thing might as well go to Thai Express. The owner has always been extremely welcoming and polite.   Thai Pepper is one of mine and my boyfriend's favourite restaurants to go to-- there's a reason why I crave it so much!"}
{"text":"The service was OK and we had to wait a tad on the long side for our food and to pay the bill. When we came to eat for lunch it was empty but by the time we left there were a couple groups.   I ordered the eggplant, peppers and basil in chilli sauce. It was supposed to be spicy but it was a tad more sweet with a hint of heat. 7/10  My boyfriend ordered pad Thai with shrimp and chicken. It was just average, a little soggy. Would give it a 6.5/10  Our appetizer the deep fried was delicious, crispy and the sauce was yum.   We have had better Thai but its decent enough if you are craving some Thai and you are in the area."}
{"text":"My only regret is not coming here sooner! I've always seen Thai Pepper on Yelp but never really got around to visiting until today.   My boyfriend and I ordered the pad Thai and it was delicious!! My boyfriend devoured his in 3 minutes!! The portion was perfect - it didn't leave me full to the point where I couldn't take it anymore like most pad Thai portions from other restaurants. I personally think this is the best pad Thai in Brampton - even my boyfriend agrees and he usually finds most restaurants to only be mediocre or \"ok\".   For drinks my boyfriend got the pineapple drink and I ordered a Thai iced tea with milk. Both were really good, and the Thai iced tea with milk was so good we ordered one for take out as well!  The server (owner I assume) is really friendly and super attentive! Made the whole experience even better.   Will definitely be coming back more often!! Seriously recommend!"}
{"text":"After reading a couple reviews, I decided to try this place.  It's close to home and the area is nice.  But, I was rather disappointed.  We got in and sat down.  It took ten minutes until someone came to greet us and serve us drinks, and she was absolutely miserable.  She made us (as well as the other diners) feel very uninvited.    We ordered the spring rolls and they were just bland salad wrapped in rice paper.  We were not impressed.  When the mains finally came, they were okay but nothing special.  They were comparable to the Thai Express in the mall food court.    Mediocre food, bad service and to top it all off there was a cricket chirping in the kitchen the entire time."}
{"text":"Amazing food.   Such a quiet place in north Brampton.    Authentic Thai food, curries are amazing, can't say enough about the soups either.   My only wish is they had delivery or an apartment for me to rent upstairs."}
{"text":"Great find!  Tucked away in a little nondescript mall is this wonderful Thai Resteraunt.    Really great atmosphere. We've been back several times and have never been disappointed.   Highly recommend."}
