{"text":"Finally!! Amazing pho in Richmond Hill! The service is quick and really friendly. The food has incredible flavour. Compared to other Vietnamese restaurants, their dishes are inexpensive. The portion sizes are quite generous for what you pay! I ordered their shrimp cold rolls, butter chicken wings, and pho. Everything was absolutely phenomenal. The restaurant is quite clean as well. I usually go to Pho88 in Scarborough, but this place is definitely better on all levels (cleanliness, cost, service, quality and quantity of food)!! 

As I was about to leave the restaurant, I had a few more sips of tea, and the kind lady working there went to the back and poured me some freshly brewed tea in a take out cup so I could enjoy it on my way home. Wonderful first time experience here. I will definitely be back! 

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Typical Vietnamese pho restaurant, had all the normal selections and decent prices. 
Great service and clean tables (nothing is sticky or greasy like some places). 

Definitely better than Xelua (pho train)! 

Open on Christmas Eve, closed Christmas!"}
{"text":"Yes!! Finally, a decent Vietnamese restaurant in Richmond Hill. Most of the good pho is in Vaughan so I'm very happy a more convenient location popped up. 

The menu is pretty comprehensive in its selection, and the prices seem to be lower than the average Viet restaurant. While the restaurant itself is spacious, they don't actually have too many tables set up. 

We came here for lunch and ordered: 
- Spring rolls: A small order gives you two spring rolls, and they were pretty big. The filling was meaty and went well with the dipping sauce.
- Bun bo hue: While the broth only had a tiny hint of spiciness, it was still very flavourful and not overly salty. This had a generous amount of toppings, including pig's blood, Viet pork roll and beef. A plate of purple cabbage was also on the side. 
- Beef pho with rare beef and beef flank: Broth was clear and light. Asked for the rare beef on the side as we don't like it to be overcooked, and it was very fresh and tender. The beef pho comes in four sizes so you have a choice to cater to your appetite. 

The food came quickly and the service was very friendly. Overall, this restaurant is great for its value with its lower than average prices, generous portions and most importantly, good food."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant three time so far and it's safe to say every time it gets better and better. The service is fast, the hostest is friendly, and the food is cheep. I have had pho many times before and this establishment stands out on a league of its own, for its great portions and food that is obviously cooked from the heart. I will continue to visit the great eatery, and enjoy every minute of the Vietnamese pop music ;) 

p.s the pha thai is killer"}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese Restaurant in Richmond Hill.
I've been to this restaurant between 80-100 times this year for lunch and  dinner .  Despite the times I've eaten here I have not tried everything on the menu.  I usually order Pho Dac Biet Large.  The soup taste authentic, not too sweet or masked with fish sauce like in some other restaurants .  It doesn't leave a bad after taste. I also love the consistency.  The ingredients are always fresh and respectful .  Meaning they don't serve dried up limes, spoiled sprouts or Thai  basil that is half green half brown .  The operating hours are respectful (7 days a week ) they don't close at 8pm or after lunch 2-4 pm for naps .  (You guys know which Vietnamese restaurant in the area  I'm referring to lol)."}
{"text":"For Richmond hill this is one of the most authentic so far. My husband and I found the soup a bit salty and the balls a tad small. Still prefer pho express on Bathurst and Steeles. Still a good choice."}
{"text":"Came here twice since opening. Finally a good pho place to go to in my neighbourhood!!"}
{"text":"We recently came back from Vietnam and was really craving Pho. This place is really good!! The soup tastes well balanced not too salty or sweet. Noodle was cooked just right. We asked for cooked bean sprout. Try the chunky chilli sauce and the oyster sauce with lemon - so good!! Oh and the avocado slush was yummy. Not too sweet, tasted natural, and blended well. :) Overall, this is our new fav Pho place!!"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times. Their Pho and Bun Bo  Hue were pretty standard. Soup seemed to be somewhat diluted and not so flavourable. Maybe I will go back to try their rice dishes one day."}
{"text":"Love the bun rieu and bun bo hue here-  didn't feel like I was dying of thirst after my meal.  Their fresh rolls contain both shrimp and pork belly which I appreciated. Will definitely be one of my new go to pho places as it is quite authentic"}
{"text":"This is one of the vietnamese restaurant we love in GTA.
Both beef and chicken pho broth taste just perfect for us,  not salty and it is hot, lots of thai basil, culantro which we love.
Rice dishes used the tiny rice which one of the rear you find in GTA. They don't coated with tone of sugar.
3 colors drink is not too sweet.

Washroom is clean.
Service is quick, friendly.
Great prices.
Great location for those live in the North."}
{"text":"We ordered pho noodle and vermicelli. The broth was average in the soup, but the vegetables were not fresh in the vermicelli.

Overall, below average experience. There are better Vietnamese places nearby."}
{"text":"Number 25. That's my pho of choice. It's has most of what I like. Mini beef balls, tender rare beef and beef tendon. The soup is clear yet favourable. 

The service is great too. Ask for Anna. She's very friendly and responsive 

Been going here at least once every 2-3 weeks since I found out about this place about half a year ago"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Tastes very fresh and the people running it are nice. No complaints at all. The price is excellent for what you are ordering."}
{"text":"Pho with ginger is the best. Get it and you won't be disappointed. 

Service was quick
Lots of parking
Good prices
Friendly people"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while looking for a place to eat with my partner, and after our experience, we'll definitely be coming back!

Highlight:
- The staff were extremely friendly, chatting with customers and more or less treating their guests like family. After ordering a Vietnamese coffee from the server, she gave me a big smile and expressed her concern for me that I might not be able to sleep from the caffeine that night. So sweet!

First Impressions:
The place was VERY clean - even the bathrooms!

Food:
While the food may not have been the best I've ever had, it had a homely charm to it and was delicious nonetheless.

Conclusion:
We'll definitely return if we're in the area, and I recommend this place based on the exceptional customer service and cleanliness of the place. The food was very tasty and inexpensive. What more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"By far one of cleanest pho places. The lady who owns it is an amazing, sweet lady. Customer service is excellent and the food never ever disappoints me. My favourite drink is avocado with condensed milk. I highly recommend having one of their shakes or specialty drinks !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been hear a few times, it's always good quality, generous portions. Service is decent. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"As an update to my previous review, the food standards have been more or less keep at a satisfactory level. The pho that my friends and I ordered were tasty and bold in flavour, but in terms of heat the soup could definitely have been hotter. The overall experience was brought down by the servers, who I presume were the daughters or family members of the establishment seeing how they were speaking to one another. At one point, you could hear a young woman behind the counter on the phone who was yelling out about her plans to visit a bar and club. In addition, the treatment of the younger waitress (again I assume in a family member) was absolutely horrendous and was done in a harsh tone. I understand cultural backgrounds and family relationships play into why this happened, but the overall professionalism and image of the establishment went downhill after that performance. If I wanted to hear yelling, drinking and who to hook up with at a club, I would've taken my pho in a college dorm."}
{"text":"My go-to pho restaurant when craving for something soupy and comforting.

Introduced to this place by a friend and have been coming back time after time.
The restaurant is very clean, brightly lit. All the condiments and utensils are arranged neatly on the trays at the table.   Floors are clean and the storefront is not crammed, unlike many other pho places. There're always customers no matter what time of day, indication of a quality authentic restaurant.

Soup base is flavourful and hot. Meat and toppings are plentiful and the herbs and bean sprouts are always fresh. I usually order a small #42 or Bun Bo Hue, both are delicious. They have a wide selection of apps, the Cha Gio (spring rolls) and the vietnamese omelette are both really good.

Parking is plentiful in the plaza. Try this place regardless whether or not you live in the area!"}
{"text":"By far the cleanest pho I have ever had and I love pho and tried it pretty much even in different countries.  The owners are amazing and  dry polite. They have the bed avocado mill shake !!!! During hot summer days this is the best drink to cool you down ."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and surprisingly it was fully packed by noon. 

We ordered pho noodles, vermicelli, spring rolls, and banh cuon. Thought the taste was pretty average and nothing special. Do like the fact that the spring rolls were crispy but overall, there wasn't much flavour to it. All in all, quality of food was just mediocre."}
{"text":"Officially my go-to Pho for Richmondhill/Uptown! 

Pho Tai Bac, is actually ran by one of the ex-owners of the popular 'Pho Con Bo', at Jane & Wilson. Having grown up, eating at Pho Con Bo, I'm happy to see this further north. 

The food is spectacular and authentic, at your typical price and portions. 

Normally, I don't really order pho at restos (household always makes pho at least once a week, we eat it almost religiously) - but I'll always make an exception here!
Their broth is authentic, flavourful, and NOT overwhelmed by MSG. Not to mention, the ample amount of meats and noodles. 

They also have very good hu tieu here!! Very hard to find, considering not all Vietnamese restaurants have it on their menu. Bun bo hue is also served here everyday, opposed to weekends only. 

On both occasions, the resto was super clean, with lovely and attentive staff, even while busy. Hopefully it stays this way. 

Unfortunately, however, they do not seem to have Vietnamese hot pot, or 7 courses of beef (bo 7 mon). 

TL;DR - Good pho! No/minimal msg, big portions. With Fall hitting us hard, it's time for you to check them out. ;)"}
{"text":"This is now my go-to Viet restaurant. It's a total hidden gem. The dishes are decently portioned and reasonably priced. I particularly like their rare beef & soft tendon pho (#23 on the menu). I literally get this almost every time. If I'm not getting the 23, then its the bun rieu, (#8B on the menu) which is basically rice noodle in a tofu and tomato/shrimp soup base. It doesn't sound like anything special, but o my goodness, that bowl of noodles is packed with flavor. Don't knock it til you try it!!! The only thing I wouldn't recommend is probably their pad Thai - the flavor is a little odd for me, and the last time I got it, it looked quite small on the plate. This place is getting more and more popular, so do try to come earlier for dinner because it starts getting pretty packed at around 7pm even on a weekday evening. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is the best pho restaurant. Period.
I'm here 2-3x a week and it is consistently perfect. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"O M G an authentic Vietnamese pho restaurant in Richmond hill! As a Vietnamese person I couldn't be happier having this store close by, the owner also owns a shop at Jane and Wilson that I went to as a child. Needless to say, if you don't want the Chinese version of pho and other dishes, come here! They're also clean and friendly here, hard to find sometimes!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnam restaurant in the neighborhood. We came here for a quick dinner and fell in love. We have been to Vietnam and this is the closest thing in York region. Great service as well!"}
{"text":"We have been going at least once a week now and am thrilled to report that their vegetarian broth has been consistently excellent.for both the regular and the spicy pho.  

My belly is so happy!"}
{"text":"One of the best pho places around. You get so much for an inexpensive price. Went Friday night and we were lucky to get a seat. They also have noodles and a large selection of exotic drinks including bubble tea. A must try for pho lovers."}
{"text":"Really good Pho. They're a good authentic alternative to Little Saigon if you cannot tolerate waiting there. 

The Pho has a good broth that isn't salty. I also go for their bun thit nuong, which is vermicelli with pork and fish sauce. It's really my new fav and should be tried here."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese Restaurant In the Town!! Great Portion, Price $, large manu selection and friendly staff. AND it opens till 12am. Not much MSG compares to other restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Good selection of Pho, vermicelli, and meat and rice dishes. Meals from 7 to 12 dollars. Pleasant and clean surroundings. Cash Only for the moment."}
{"text":"One of the best pho in Richmond hill/Markham.  I believe it is very authentic. I ordered the rare beef/beef ball noodles,  amazing broth and beef.  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS SPOT  for people in Uptown if you are craving for pho."}
{"text":"Finally! A great Vietnamese restaurant in uptown! I wish we took pictures but we ate it all before anyone realized. We actually didn't know about this place for a long time; we have been trying to go to Saigon (restaurant across the street) a few times but it's always been closed (my mom managed to go in and try it once). 

Food:
We went as an entire family of 6 on Mother's day. Each of us ordered various pho along with one plate of fried spring rolls (I forget the name but it had taro inside which was amazing) as well as the traditional fresh spring rolls. The sauce for the fresh spring rolls was different from what we were used to (we usually use a mix of fish sauce, peppers, garlic, and lime) but still very delicious and well made. 

The soup broth was not too salty and my mom managed to drink the soup without feeling thirsty (so possibly little to no MSG). She said compared to Saigon, she liked this restaurant much more since the soup is more flavourful. They were very generous with the portions and we were all full even after each getting a small bowl of pho. 

The avocado drink is nice and light; not super sweet which is great. The Che Ba Mau (three coloured ice drink) was delicious and refreshing way to end the evening. The only pet peeve that I had was that the drinks were served in take-out cups as opposed to glass cups but I think they realized that people usually don't finish the whole drink at the restaurant?

Restaurant: 
Clean and uncomplicated restaurant. Not much to see but it's fairly open without the usual sticky feeling you might find at some other asian restaurants. 

Staff:
Fairly nice and quick. It was Mother's day so at the end, one of the staff members went around and gave a rose to every mother in the restaurant which was a very sweet gesture. 

Overall:
This will probably be our new favourite whenever we go uptown. According to my vietnamese fiancee - pho in Vietnam is always #1 but this comes as a close second.

{"text":"3.5/5

Came by on a Saturday, around 12:30. Was about half full, mostly families and smaller groups. The location is a bit quieter so parking is a bit easier compared to the TNT plaza across Weldrick. Service is definitely a plus here in terms of speed, cleanliness and attentiveness. The menu was a bit overwhelming at first as I was trying to look for the usual 101/house special item, which is 42 here. Ordered a large, and for under $10, the portion was sufficiently filling. Broth was not too salty, noodles were good, and a nice mix of beef items. 

note: debit/cash only"}
{"text":"Nice casual atmosphere and very friendly service. 

For lunch, I ordered:

1. Fish sauce chicken wings
- the taste is good but a bit salty for me

2. Rare beef pho with tendon and brisket
-they give you lots of meat compared to some other Vietnamese restaurant
- I wish the soup is a bit hotter 
- the flavour is ok but can be a bit more concentrated 

3. Grilled beef, spring rolls, sugar cane shrimp vermicelli 
- this is overall done well
-they use the thicker vermicelli noodles
- meat is marinated well with good flavours 

4. Hot Vietnamese coffee
-the coffee has condensed milk at the bottom of the cup where you drip fresh coffee over it
- very sweet!!!
-may be too much condensed milk and made the drink too sweet and not hot enough"}
{"text":"First time here. I was looking for a Vietnamese restaurant on Yelp and I found this one nearby.

I asked the waitress if they have any vegan options here and she said she can serve me a spicy veggie soup with rice noodles. Its always appreciated when a restaurant accommodate to different lifestyles. The soup was delicious. Fresh ingredient and great spices. The closest a vegan can get to pho. Service is super friendly. Prices are affordable.

Overall this is a nice family owned Vietnamese restaurant. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I was excited to have a Vietnamese restaurant with good hours opened in my neighbourhood. The Pho broth is not too salty but the portion of the regular size noodles is on the small side. Their vermicelli is portioned better and they also have Banh Cuon! 

The restaurant is bright and clean and service is good. They also have WIFI which is a plus. 

A great place to go in the area."}
{"text":"my friend said this place have private custom menu so we went and tried.  we ordered the salted chicken and vietnamese assort platter.  the bird is very similar to the chinese one, just with a homemade sauce.  the special type of vietnamese herb leaves made the assorted platter so special.  we are advised to wrap all ingredients using the rice paper.  the leaves taste a little \"fishy\" and with little mint....i believe not everyone can take the taste, but it could be covered by lemon leaves and hot sauce.  this is a place i would come back for the noodle soup in future"}
{"text":"New Vietnamese spot at yonge and weldrick. I have been twice with good and bad experiences. 

The first visit I got the com bi with all the different meats, it was pretty good, small portion size from what I'm used to and the fish sauce (nuc mum)  was lackluster. Also never enough shredded pork! The egg quiche thing was quite small too. I also ordered the bubble tea out of curiosity. It was very good, the small is smaller than a regular bbt small sized cup. The tapioca is also lower in quality compared to most places. 

The second visit I ordered the pad Thai which was very heavily made of tamarind.. It was way too tangy and not pad thai like at all. Maybe they made the wrong dish? Who knows. 

The service is friendly, it's clean inside and the washrooms are also very clean! 

Overall pretty good but not the best. Would try other dishes in the future."}
{"text":"Had shrimp rolls (rice roll) with great peanut sauce. Great pho! Good soup, meat was very tasty. They serve non sweetened ice tea as well! 
Plenty of sauces too."}
{"text":"My go-to pho place. Good portions, fairly quick, no surprises and cheap! 

#54 with rice noodle is my go to. It's got a mix of meats and there's also pig's blood in it. Only complaint is that it could be spicier. 

The spring rolls are also good - pretty standard and freshly fried. 

Garnishes are also fresh - so don't forget to squeeze lime into your bowl."}
{"text":"(Food:)
The VEGETARIAN SPRING ROLLS were to DIE FOR.  They taste like normal vietnamese spring rolls with the added bonus of having no meat in them!

The VEGAN SPICY NOODLE SOUP was a bit too spicy for me, but for the price, you get a large portion!  Also added bonus of being vegan!


(Price:)
VEGETARIAN SPRING ROLLS: $4.50 for 2 rolls (SO WORTH)

VEGAN SPICY NOODLE SOUP: $9.00


(Service:)
Typical Asian service.  (which means not the best)


(Overall:)
Good Viet place! I'm still dreaming about those spring rolls though."}
{"text":"Got the take out rice with chicken & spring rolls. Tasted good. Also had some pho, the broth was good but a little more on the salty side. The service while getting take-out was nice. Served us tea while we waited & the food was very quick to go!"}
{"text":"Great place for families and kids.  the noodle soup portions are generous and the soup base is tasty.  we ordered the fried spring roll and they too were nice, the filling was good.  the cold coffee was the same as most places with a decent amount of crushed ice.  the Service was great, quickly and friendly."}
{"text":"It's one of the better place to go to in Richmond hill. The pho soup taste homemade, however the downfall is that everything is overly seasoned. The chicken was extremely salty that the salt flavour overpowered the lemongrass and Vietnamese seasoning. They also have chef specials that are not listed on the menu; such as ban xeo which is Vietnamese crepes (on other Vietnamese restaurant in the Richmond him/Markham area has this)"}
{"text":"This is based on one dish only: the \"spicy\" Bun Bo Hue. Came twice to have this item and both times not spicy enough. 2nd time I told the waitress to make it \"very spicy\" but it still didn't hit the mark. The soup was flavourful but didn't have much heat. Will give 3 stars for friendly service, clean utensils and free WiFi."}
{"text":"Great local pho place and comparable to Little Saigon. The reason this is our regular spot is because staff is super friendly and consistent. Little Saigon disappointed us on a few occasions by not giving us extra lime, \"because they ran out\" (right), so we don't go back, though their pho is very good. It's not like we're asking for a whole lime tree, maybe just a couple extra wedges! Anyhow, Pho Tai Bac has delicious rolls and to date, it's the best I've had. Pho is awesome, portions are great and they have super hot pickled chilies! Great friendly staff, fast service and fresh food! We love this spot.

Tip: eat in only. We ordered out once and it was AWFUL."}
{"text":"Went here because the Vietnamese place across the street is closed on Mondays.  Pho was very delicious.  Lots of depth of flavour.  Smokey and you could smell the spices.  Better than average.  Rice noodle bowl was meh.  Noodles with thicker than I'm used to and the grilled pork was hard and chewy.  Would definitely return for the pho though.  They take debit which is a plus too."}
{"text":"This restaurant is owned by one of the ex-owners of Pho Con Bo near Jane and Wilson. You can tell the menu is practically identical, however although this place is pretty good compared to other pho restaurants, it's still not as good as Pho Con Bo. It is much cleaner though."}
{"text":"We decided to randomly check out Pho Tai Bac for something different and comforting. While tempted to order a Pho dish, I slipped back to my favorite \"dry\" offering of Bun (noodles) with shrimp (on a stick of sugarcane, I believe) peanuts and veggies. The server offered a bowl of hot soup which was rich in flavour and very aromatic. My wife ordered her favorite, Pho with beef, however  like many Spidina Vietnamese shops, they don't seem to serve tripe. I personally would be afraid of that stuff, but there is no accounting for some tastes. 

Like other reviews, there is likely something for everyone, from aforementioned Pho and dry options, to a more safe choice like grilled chicken and rice. I also am a sucker for sauces, such as Hosein sauce and others which I had a tough time identifying.

The service is lightening fast, friendly and almost like a cultural experience, in that the restaurant seems transplanted from its Asian roots. For the three of us, with tip and a few sodas, was about $27.00, which is a good value for a healthier option. That also includes complementary tea. Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"We usually go all the way down to scarborough for pho, but we dont have to anymore! We went to pho tai bac on a whim, because we were craving pho after a 6 hour roadtrip. The pho definitely hit the spot. The broth was super hot and flavourful. Fresh rolls were also wonderful. We are so glad we dont have to go so far for good pho anymore !"}
{"text":"Heard from a colleague about this new Pho place in Richmond Hill and was soooo soooo excited to try it! (especially when I'm a huge soup lover). Usually if I am trying a place for the first time,  I usually order something authentic yet comforting to be on the safe side to avoid bad first impressions. At least if a restaurant made a simple dish really really good for the first time for me, I'll come back again and explore more other items from their menu. So I ordered a simple Pho noodle soup w/rare beef & tendon (small bowl), the soup was indeed very clear but flavourful, however, there was more meat than noodles. After dumping in the beansprouts and mint leaves, I could barely see the noodles.  We also ordered the fried spring rolls, I have to be really honest, the spring rolls did not look appetizing at all, it looked soft and pre-fried and it wasn't crispy at all, hence this is why I only rated this place with 3 stars, which was mostly for the Pho noodle soup and their amazing friendly staff. I would definitely come back again and try other items on their menu.  If you are wondering where this place is,  it is in the same plaza as Pizza Pizza and Shishlix,right next to a pharmacy. There's also another vietnamese restaurant in the T & T plaza so don't be confused with that one. I hope you find this review useful :)"}
{"text":"Pho Tai Bac is the second pho/Vietnamese restaurant close to where i live. Been here a few times now and have tried different pho options as well as the Bun. First time i went there didn't like pho mainly because i found the noodles to taste a bit stale. I have tried the pho a few more times since then and it's been great. The broth has great flavor and the noodles been good. The sizes are very generous and priced very reasonably.  The staff is very nice and service is great. The decoration is very mediocre but who cares...that's not why i go there. Unlike Little Saigon (in the next plaza), they do accept cards and that's another reason we go here more often to satisfy our constant pho craving.

{"text":"the best Vietnamese restaurants are in Scarborough/Markham, at least in my opinion. but this one opened up last summer and it's pretty great and the prices can't be beat! most of you know, you don't come to Vietnamese restaurants for comfort, but they're pretty clean here. can't go wrong with a classic bowl of pho, i usually order is raw beef and ask for Vietnamese ham as well! not every restaurant will have viet ham, so i definitely add it when i can. their soup is really flavourful, not overly salty.

i've also had their báuh cuôn, which is essentially a rice noodle roll stuff with pork and ear mushrooms (they had shrimps in it, which i didn't really prefer)  i definitely have better but i've also had unreal homemade ones, so it's hard to compare. just if you have a craving for it - not a lot of places serve it since they're very time consuming to prepare and make! their viet coffee is a must, they made it so good here! i wish i worked in the area, they have really good lunch specials as well."}
{"text":"Yesssssssssss this place was delicious. A+++ pho. Their broth was flavourful, and well seasoned. Their noodles were great and their herbs were fresh. You KNOW this place is going to be slamming because out front they have pictures of their food. Only hole in the walls that are amazing do this and they did not disappoint. I also ordered their bun bo hue and it was yummy and spicy and well done. Not too salty or over spiced. I will definitely be back when in the area because they were awesome."}
{"text":"Finally a solid pho spot in the richmond hill area.  The hills have been missing a good pho spot.  I came here today as my friend told me the phone here is as good as pho on ossington.  I'm not saying it's as good as ossington but i can say it was better than I expected and I can confidently say it's the best pho north of steeles.  The place is nice and clean and the service is solid."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to visit Pho Tai Bac and they did not disappoint!

We ordered their pho, fried spring rolls, and a jackfruit shake.

Let's start with their pho. There is no cilantro in it, which is GREAT! Their broth is flavourful and not too salty. There was plenty of noodles and meat.. a pretty generous portion.

We also really enjoyed their fried spring rolls. They're of a good size and tasted proper. Nice and crispy. 

Jackfruit shake is something I always order and this one was perfect. It was not too milky nor too sweet, good amount of jackfruit flavour. It also didn't take forever to arrive, as many restaurants somehow bring the shake when i'm almost finished eating my meal.

The restaurant itself is in a plaza, so there is plenty of free parking in the lot. Inside the resto is quite spacious and with open space. 

They play some good Vietnamese music, too! And there is free wifi. Nice amenities.

I highly recommend this place, and this is now my go-to place for pho in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"I wish I had the option of giving this place 3.5 but I figured I'd be generous because I do visit often and don't want it to close down! It's the only pho in the area (besides little Saigon which is small and never open) and for the only pho, it is very legit. Legit as in it is a no frills place- basic tables and chairs with Asian lighting and not super clean kinda feel. 

The portions for the pho are a good value as a large is only $8 and the meat to noodle ratio is one of the best. The soup tastes good but my only concern is that the soup is never hot where it burns your mouth. The iced milk coffee is also only $3. Both the fresh and fried spring rolls are pretty standard. The waitresses there are busy and they make it a point but they're never rude."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time tonight and had a great meal. Before anything else, you notice the decor, lacking in bright pink, tacky gold plastic and neon lights I have grown to look for in a good pho place. The bun bo hue was excellent. The broth was fragrant, served with pre cut herbs and basil on top. The pork hock was deboned and precut which is a personal favourite treatment. Finally the noodles were just a little chewy just the way I like it. We also orders the Vietnamese crepe wrapped in lettuce which was deliciously seasoned and a great combination of savoury, fried and fresh. For less than 10 bucks a person included tax, this is not the last time we come here."}
{"text":"The soup was oily for what you call authentic vietnamese pho. I asked the chef in the back to remake the bowl but all she did was scoop up the bigger blobs of oil and hand it back to me. I would like to also mention that I asked for no onions in my pho and she put onions on it. Please read the slip carefully before making the pho because there are customers who may be allergic to onions, thanks."}
{"text":"Had the grilled pork with spring roll on vermicelli... the spring roll was really delicious... everything else was ok.

I also ordered the avocado shake but maybe I'm more used to sweeter versions ... this one tasted \"healthy\" vs the \"dessert\" taste I'm used to lol"}
{"text":"Pho was very good & authentic for Markham/Richmond Hill area. Real Vietnamese people eat and work here. Not like those fake & unauthentic pho place. Same owners as the Pho Dau Bo at Jane & Wilson. Broth was good & fresh :)"}
{"text":"Very weak decor. Average food. Extra star accounted for because of low price. The drink in the disposable cup was a turn off. And I couldn't scoop anything at all with the flimsy disposable spoon."}
{"text":"\"they've recreated the great hole in the wall placed you find in the west end.\" 

Literally a hole in the wall as it's at 9555 Yonge st which under construction right now is at Yonge and Weldrick. Hard to find parking during the week because there are office buildings and other restaurants and businesses around but worth it. If you can't see it off the street it's because the front entrance is maybe 20ft wide and it's all the way at the back. 

Real Vietnamese people own and operate this place and the menu is very vast but affordable. Dated tile flooring, white walls, and jade touches everywhere scream authentic (I'm serious) so already I was impressed. The cutlery is nicely laid out and they use green coloured chop sticks, spoons and little bowls and that is pretty cool. 

Pho soup is really on point. Delicious, aromatic, fresh tasting withoit being salty or drying. Meat was cooked perfectly and delicious. Lots of it too. Very happy to come back and eat this again as it's inside warming and good value. I always avoid the biggest size a pho place has and get one less. More than enough. 

5 out of 5 if you like pho."}
{"text":"Pho Tai Bac is located at Yonge and Weldrick. I am going to have to say this Pho place is one of the best in Richmond Hill. This hidden gem on Yonge Street is not so visible, but if you find it you wont be disappointed. You can tell how good a place is based on how good their pho is, and as Tony the Tiger would say, \"It's GRRREAT!\" The pho portions are a decent size, and the broth is wonderful. The broth is full of flavour and not so fatty. So it is great to have when you have a cold or flu. Many pho places have a soup base that is really fatty and though it might be really tasty, when you finish eating it you feel like all the flem in the world is sitting in your throat. Lastly at the payment counter they have these soft chew candies that really hit the spot after a nice meal. This place is my go to spot in Richmond Hill. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"The Pho place in the plaza across the street is closed on Monday so we tried this place - Above average Pho. 
Not a big fan for their vermecelli though - and stay away from the 'sausage/meatball' option, it has a sour taste which I am not sure if it's meant to be or just expired meat product...."}
{"text":"Went there after a stroll at Hillcrest mall and stumbled on this little resto near by. Big fan of pho, this is actually to my surprise not too shaby. 
Ordered a pho tai (rare beef) and banh cuon (rice rolls). Broth was not bad, but I did like te noodles since they were on the softer side (many places prep it more aldente), but I would say 6.5/10 for the overall.
 Rice rolls were decent as well. Rice roll had a good consistency, but the cha than came with it wasn't great. If you order this platter, just stick with the rolls.

If you;re in the area and in the mood for pho, this is not a bad place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to give this place a try. Pretty busy on a Saturday at 2pm. We ordered a large rare beef pho, small rare beef, tripes, and beef tendon pho, and shared the springrolls. We found the broth lacked flavour and the meat was not the best quality. Springrolls was good. For the price it is not bad, but definitely had better pho."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner. Upon entering, we weren't really greeted, just pointed towards a table. The staff weren't mean though. We ordered pho and bun vermicelli bowls. The pho is ok! But the bun vermicelli bowls were bland tasting, the mint leaves we're old and shriveled, and the spring rolls tasted like they were deep fried in old oil. The plate of basil leaves we got looked like the plant was diseased or old. Some leaves were black."}
{"text":"Pho Tac Bac was not one of my priority Pho places to try, but it was Boxing Day evening, I had skipped a meal, it was getting late and the temperature outside near Minus Gazillion, all making a pretty strong case for a convenient Pho pit stop.

Upon entry PTB makes a fair attempt at clean & tasteful appearance on a small budget, with an efficient arrangement of tables and good mix of large & small seating areas.  Immediately facing the entrance is a tiny waiting area with an incongruous antique 2-seater in Imperial Yellow which I found pleasantly humorous though I'm not sure that was the intention. 

Place is very clean and staff can bee seen promptly cleaning tables after customers and maintaining the front counter area. There was slight non-food smell which to me vaguely resembled that of a nursing home, but it was faint and not obtrusive.  I found the jade green chopsticks, spoons & dipping bowls a cool departure form the norm.

Ordered Beef Pho with Tendon & well-done Flank (#31). Average size for a Medium with competitive $8.50 price.  Unfortunately on this night broth did not meet expectations raised by good reviews from credible sources. It was practically clear and just about the most watery I've ever been served.  On the bright side there was a generous amount of Beef Flank which was tender and tasty, the noodles were also excellent. Too little tendon though. Overall the dish need a a fair bit of help from the Sriracha, Fish Sauce & Soy Sauce in order to finish with enthusiasm.  (for what it's worth, the Soy & Fish sauces were well sourced and tasted very fresh ) 

The verdict?  It could be argued that disregarding the broth, at $8.50 it wasn't that bad a deal just for the noodles, beef flank and DIY seasoning supplies. But of course the broth was a big part of the Pho proposition so I'm disappointed.  

2 Stars for the food and a 3rd for excellent service, good housekeeping and having the extended hours.  I'll probably it give it another shot at some point since the location & hours are useful to me most of the menu is priced very competitively. The rice & noodle dishes at other tables looked very well made, maybe that;s the way to go next time."}
{"text":"Pho Tai Bac is a decent pho restaurant. For the price of it and the fast pace it's good."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best pho in richmond hill that is actually owned by Vietnamese people and not Chinese. 

Overall pretty good, decent portions for food, friendly service.

Be warned they are cash only and do not take credit card

Also the bbt is pretty small for what your paying. It's tasty, but not support satisfying in terms of quantity."}
{"text":"Favourite pho place I've ever been to. Gone  o multiple places all over toronto and this one is always consistent with its broth. never a bad day"}
{"text":"Came here tonight and it absolutely surprised me how good this place was. As many of the other people said the soup base was amazing. Definitely some good spices and herbs and it wasn't too salty. I don't normally drink the soup too often when I go to pho places but this was a different experience for me. I cannot get enough of it! The portions of meat is good too. 

The vermicelli was quite standard and I felt the spring rolls didn't stand out to me too much. I'll just stick with the pho next time which is fine by me. 

This place is packed which is a great sign and all of the servers were very polite. One accidentally spilled water on my phone and she apologized and came back to ask if it was really ok. The phone is fine and I'm writing this great review for them. Will be back for more pho!"}
{"text":"We had planned to go to Little Saigon, but given the lineup there we decided to check out this place in the neighboring plaza. The place was half full on a Saturday night.

Seated in the middle of the restaurant, it was really cold even given winter. I think they noticed and turned up the heat because about 10 minutes after we arrived I felt hot air blowing on my face.

This place has excellent prices and decent food. The small pho was $6 and plentiful. The shrimp cold rolls were plump and yummy. The vermicelli with spring roll and grilled pork had a lot of mint in it which I liked, but the pork should have been cooked more evenly. The meal was served very quickly.

On the downside: my menu was sticky in multiple places, I rewiped our table and five tables had food/dirty utensils/crumpled used napkins underneath them. Many chairs around the room could have used a wipedown also."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good, whether you get pho, bun, or something else. Food is amazing, portions are generous, prices are fair, service is quick, staff are friendly. I haven't ever had bubble tea or ca phe here, so I can't comment on the drinks, but the food is fantastic. I've ordered nem nuong with rice paper rolls a few times here, and it's always really good.

This place has a couple of my Vietnamese friends' stamps of approval... always a good sign."}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese and I have to admit, this place is pretty good. Been living in the area for 14+ years and haven't found a restaurant that has decent authentic Vietnamese food until this place opened recently. This is now my go to place for pho and bun bo hue. Now I don't have to go downtown anymore."}
{"text":"Service - friendly owners and staffs.

Food - Good. I like their steam rice rolls. Noodles are good. Broth is not salty. No MSG. Portion is decent and good balance between meat and noodles. 

Atmosphere - clean and neat.

Price - decent.

Will go back again!"}
{"text":"This place is the younger sister of Pho Con Bo at Jane and Wilson....been visiting that location for 5 years, and upon discovering this new one I felt blessed. The lady owner is a sweetheart ( bad thing the daughter didn't take after her), food's always on point, prices ridiculously cheap...best pho places in GTA.


Keep it up guys, we love you!!!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Great prices
Friendly service

Cons:
Food can take a while to come out

Looking to try new pho places around where I live, we stumbled upon this place.  Pho Tai Bac is a nice little family run(from what I can tell) pho restaurant.  It's very no frills but it does its talking with its food.  

Pho Tai Bac is located in a small plaza on Yonge.  If you aren't looking for it, you will never know it's there. Like I said before, it's very no frills.  Simple tables and chairs, nothing elaborate at all.  The staff all greet you with smiles and you're seated pretty promptly.  It's not the biggest place, so you might have to wait a little sometimes.  Turnover is pretty quick so you won't have to wait long at least.

Opening the menu, I immediately notice that the prices here are cheaper than most pho places nowadays.  Perhaps this is due their location being a bit out of the way.  Nonetheless, it was a welcome surprise.  You won't find many pho places where the largest bowls are less than $10 now.  Everything here seems about a $1 or $2 cheaper than what I am accustomed to seeing. 

I ordered the extra large special pho and my GF got the vermicelli.  A side order of spring rolls were ordered as well.  As with most places, the pho comes out very fast after you order.  For those that don't know, the special pho is basically pho with a bit of all the meats in it.  The portions here are very good for the price.  The broth is clearer here than most places but it's very good nonetheless.  The spring roll wasn't the best one I've had, but at $4 an order which is the best I've seen for a long time, it's well worth it.  My GF's vermicelli was pretty good.  The beef could of been more tender but overall it was great.  The problem with the vermicelli was it took quite a while to come out.  I was almost finished my extra large bowl of pho before it finally came out. It was busy when we came so this is something to watch for when you come.

The service here was excellent.  Like I said, I believe it's family run and everyone there was very polite and courteous.  It was a very enjoyable meal overall.

I definitely see myself coming back here in the future.  Pho at a very good price and great service. You can't ask for more in a pho restaurant."}
{"text":"Thought of trying out this place after hearing friends rave how good it is. Since we are around the area, we finally tried it.

The restaurant is bright and clean. Typical vietnamese restaurant setup. Nothing fancy. Service is good and fast. 

Food is better than other vietnamese restaurant. The pho has clear tasty soup. Serving is big. You can choose S, M, L, XL. My boys ordered their regular pho, they have a wide variety of meat combination to choose from. You will surely find your combination. I ordered Bun with grilled beef grilled pork and spring roll ($8.5) and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place recently! What can I say. It's a pretty solid pho place. The pho soup base is on point, one of the best I've had.

People talk quite loud here but it just adds to the authenticity!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I see someone I know... I'm convinced it's a Richmond hill go-to-hidden gem. I love this simplicity of this place as well as the price. The portions are large and they have a wide range of items on their menu. If you're not interested in a bowl of pho, they have plenty of other options. Even though their list of pho is extensive, I did not find the exact beef combo I was looking for. I wrote down what toppings I wanted on the paper for our order, and they delivered exactly what I asked for! It was wonderful. The meat is also extremely lean. In addition to my pho bowl, I got a jack fruit smoothie. It was delicious and I thought the price was good too. However, it was just a tad too watery but I think it was from ice melting in it. Overall, this is a place my friends and I will never stop going to.
Ps. Free WiFi
Pps. My friends little cousin was crying (loudly) and a woman working there came to our table to offer him candy. Thanks, he enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"The BF wanted a \"bun rieu\" and saw a picture on yelp that they had it so we decided to drop by. Turns out they didn't have it, the BF was devastated and just got a \"bun bo hue\" instead. He thought it was okay, the soup lacked the tomato base, thin and just spicy.

Since we dropped by early, I wasn't too hungry so I got their shrimp and pork roll and their avocado smoothie. The roll was okay, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  I ended up just eating one roll and took the other one to go. I was disappointed in the avocado smoothie, it was basically avocado and pieces of ice. I was chewing on ice each time I took a sip. 

The place is quaint, not too busy so if you want a hideaway place to eat this would be the perfect place for you. Service was good, the staff were friendly.

Overall this place is average, it would be two stars but I added the extra star is for service and the friendliness of staff. I probably won't come back again :("}
{"text":"Pho Tai Bac is average overall due to its inconsistency. It has its good and its bad side.

Pros:
A wide variety of pho, rice, sides and other Vietnamese food.
The pho broths are available in a choice of four bowl sizes. I order the small, which I find sufficient as my noodle bowls always have broth left over.
The two older ladies working there are nice and attentive.
The vegetables and sprouts are fresh and plentiful.
They have attempted a couple of design elements and even have a mascot (they recently have changed their store-front as well). 
The sugar cane shrimp sticks are quite good here.

Cons:
The broth is not the deepest or the most flavourful and it could be a little greasy.
The Vietnamese crepe is just bad. Do not order it. It falls apart and is very greasy.
The younger waitress is scowling and has not been taught the following English words: \"hello\" or \"you are welcome\" or \"thank-you\" or \"good-bye.\"

I have ordered # 21 (I think), which is the rare beef pho and #44 (which has everything in it) and found the above description to be accurate.
Tai Bac will do in a pinch, but Saigon Star a couple of minutes away is a better bet.

There is a sign facing indoors with logos of all the credit cards, but as the note upon entrance reminds customers they only accept debit and cash. So, let me add a con as if I am a credit card company.
Con:
How are we supposed to analyse your spending patterns, report you for a fee to the credit rating agencies, how are they supposed to sell your information for a fee to companies doing credit checks, how are we supposed to build profiles on customers and sell it and upload to various governments so they can keep tabs on you and finally how are we supposed to hope you over-spend, cannot keep up and pay us interest. Come on Pho Tai Bac!!!"}
{"text":"After all these years I can't believe I just discovered this neighbourhood restaurant before today. The food and service is amazing! Ordered the Pho and several other random dishes we never tried before. All of it was incredible. Now I understand why the place was packed. Even with the crows service was fast. We wil definitely return."}
{"text":"I had to check it out since it was down the street from my house and I love Pho. I ordered the shrimp fresh rolls to start. The rice paper was fresh and the veggies inside were delicious with also a good amount of shrimp. The peanut sauce was the same as every other place...
As for pho I got the shrimp pho. The noodles were good and there were 5 shrimp in the soup. The broth was okay, it had some flavour but I had to add more of my own. 
The service was friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"The broth is the best I've ever had (Not oily) Healthy! I'm blessed to live a block away from this place. Authentic pho made by a lovely Vietnamese Family."}
{"text":"Pho Tai Bac is good. It's a solid pho joint, where the broth is delicious and clear. If you've got a craving, this is a good place to stop by. No frills, fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Food is good. Fresh, ample portions, even if you're all by yourself you get a full teapot just for 1 person at the table. That's  very convenient because I don't like asking for a refill even when I'm fully entitled to one. Customer service is just the way it should be - you get your tea right away and your order shortly after. If anything this place lacking it would be some decor update, but it's not such a big deal after all."}
{"text":"Finally excellent pho in Richmond Hill! Broth, meat and veggies all really fresh and tasty. If you like spicy, ask for the lemongrass spicy paste. Excellent. Had the shrimp spring roll and it was excellent too. Friendly service and great flavors. Don't miss this if you like authentic Vietnamese."}
{"text":"I thought I would be disappointed but it was great! 

We ordered the basic beef pho and spring rolls. My husband and I enjoyed the food a lot! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Richmond Hill seems to have a good selection of Pho restaurants, and Pho Tai Bac is no exception. My wife and I originally intended to go to Little Saigon but the lineup was out the door. With a hungry stomach and an urge for Vietnamese soup noodles, we found this place.

First impressions:
+ Packed with people (didn't have to wait as long - their space is slightly larger than Little Saigon)
+ Authentic (owners are actually Vietnamese)
- Really cold (rainy weather, blasted AC, who knows?)
- At busy times, servers are a bit inattentive (no utensils, had to call down server to get a ticket to write order)

Ordered two Pho Tai Nam (rare/cooked beef) in a small and large portion size. The small is pretty standard in appearance, but there's slightly more noodles. The large is pretty filling and has a good balance of ingredients. Both are really well priced.

The broth is pretty clean tasting and flavourful - just the right amount of seasoning. The meat is of pretty good quality; no chewy or overly fatty pieces. And judging by the plate, it looks like they actually clean their bean sprouts. Good by my books.

All in all, a good spot for Pho if your favourite one happens to be full. If you can deal with the mediocre service, their pho is something you won't PHOget."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try to satisfy the pho craving. The restaurant is reasonably clean with condiments and utensils clean and organized (didn't feel the need to do my own Asian dishwashing in tea, I feel some of you might know what I mean)---nevertheless, a minor fruit fly problem I feel all pho establishments have difficulty avoiding. Ordered the 22 XL (rare beef and brisket). I'm not one to drown my noodles in hoisin and sriracha (and no judgment to those who do) unless the broth is truly lacking (I'm a basil-lime-chili pepper only kind of guy). The broth certainly was not lacking: transparent down to mid-bowl, with a colour and taste suggestive of a stock that has leveraged all the flavours of the meat/marrow--- in short, made with lots of love. The fried spring rolls that a previous reviewer suggested were also very good (minced shrimp, pork, and taro? what a delicious combo!). Avocado shake and the iced viet coffee were good. If it weren't for the fact that this place is a little far from home/work, I would consider coming on a regular basis. Recommended"}
{"text":"So originally we intended to go to Little Saigon which is in the plaza directly north of this one, but there was a sign on the door that said the restaurant is on vacation. Not renovation, vacation. I guess, it worked to hard over the years and needed a break? So we ended up here at Pho Tai Bac, Little Saigon's competition. We arrived around 18:30. The place was not full, and we were seated immediately. By 19:00, place was packed and line was out the door.

The place is family owned and operated (by Chinese Vietnamese). The staff speaks many languages as I was able to discern Vietnamese, Cantonese, Mandarin, Teo Chew, and English. Credit cards are not accepted so make sure you bring cash.

The decor is typical of Pho places, plastic (formica laminated) tables and chairs. Sauces and utensils lay in containers and are stationed right at your table for self service.

The service was good and typical of Asian restaurants: you call them if you need something. They only come to clear empty dishes, otherwise they leave you alone. The staff remained friendly, thanking you for your business and greeting you adieu.

On the menu for today is the staples: Pho, Com, Bun, Cha Gio, and a Sour Sop Shake.

#42. Pho Dac Biet (Dac Biet means \"special\", which basically means it has everything in it). The broth is the star here and performed decently. It was slightly on the salty side, but carried pho flavour. Star anise was also noticeable. Very good meat to pho to broth ratio with the large bowl as every spoonful had all three elements. 4 stars. 

#74. Bun Bo/Thit/Ga Nuong (Vermicelli with Beef/Pork/Chicken). This dish is all about the fish sauce. Depending on the region, the sauce will differ in taste. Here, it was pretty balanced. No overpowering fishiness and not too sweet. 3 stars. The meats carried good flavours, but were a little light on the grilling. 3,5 stars.

#127. Com. Tam Thap Cam (Pork chop and chicken). Same as the bun, meats well flavoured, but light on the grilling. 3,5 stars. The rice was mushy (too much water?), and they skimped in the onion oil. 1 star. The vegetables were huge, and had all the right ones, no skimping on ingredients here. 4 stars. Overall 3 stars.

#1. Cha Gio (Spring Rolls). They used a Chinese spring roll wrap... wrong! The ingredients were ok. 2 stars. The fish sauce was the same as the other dishes. 3 stars. Again did not skimp on accompaniments, carrots, radish, lettuce and noodles. All were fresh. 5 stars. Overall 3 stars. 

#158. Soursop shake. This was not good. To much ice. Too little soursop. 1 star. 

Like many places they have high points and low points. I'd return for some dishes but would stay away from others. 3 stars overall.

---------------

Pho flavours are highly subjective and expectations depend greatly on which region you're from (if Vietnam is your motherland). If Vietnam is not your motherland, here's a really quick summary of what you should expect in terms of flavour for each major region. Decide on the one you like, and search for your Pho-vourite place. Know what you're eating before you judge...

North (Hanoi). Simple dishes often influenced by tradition. Strict pairings of ingredients and the cooler climate makes stewing a popular method of cooking. Black Pepper tends to replace most spices. Light, yet balanced flavours make up all the complexity. Lots of Chinese influence due to geographical proximity to China. Signature dishes include: Pho, Bun rieu, Bun cha, banh cun.

Central (Hue & Hoi An). Former Imperial Capital. More spices are used and greater care is taken with regards to presentation. Due to heritage, meals tend to be more luxurious with multiple course meals. Food is spicier than the North and there is less Chinese influence. Hoi An is unique in that it where North meets Central, often fusing the two cuisines. Signature dishes include: Com hen, Cao Lau, Banh Mi.

South (Saigon). Warmer climate = higher harvest yields, so liberality is often displayed with southern dishes. Flavours are bolder and more vibrant with the use of fresh herbs. They also tend to favor the sweet side through the use of coconut milk. French influence in some of the cuisine due to occupancy during the war. Signature dishes include: Banh Khoai, Bánh xèo, Goi Cuon.

{"text":"The Pho noodle soup was awesome and the restaurant was clean.
The service provided was good.  I would definitely be back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Tired this Pho restaurant last Saturday. I ordered a XL-size special pho at $10.25 plus tax. Affordable price and good taste. I think it's the best Pho restaurant in Richmond hill area, but the place is not very clean."}
{"text":"Pho Tai Bac is a good option if you want to have some decent Vietnamese food in the area. 

Bun Bo Hue was good! I like that they really have all the toppings including blood pig cube. I would come back for that and of course now Katelyn T mentioned Banh Cuon!! Hopefully it would be available next time when I visit!

Service was fast and friendly. 

Note to owner: please kindly wipe the washroom doors.. it has hot sauce and other yucky stuff on it."}
{"text":"My favourite go to restaurant for pho. The quality of the food is exceptional when compared to other locations. A friendly environment that delivers quality dishes with variety of spices and herbs. 

Quick and an accessible location for the Richmond Hill community."}
{"text":"The best Viet cuisine I've had in the 905 in some time. The owners moved their restaurant from the midland/finch area to Richmond hill 2 years ago - and the new locale has embraced their authentic, affordable food.  
One look at the menu (its huge) and you know you're eating at a special restaurant. The owners have been serving Vietnamese food in the GTA for over 20 years. Great flavours. Sauces are legit. The grilled chicken fresh rolls are dynamite. Deep fried spring rolls - better than most. The Pho broth - rich and full - not overly oily but definitely packed with home-brew stock flavours. 

I highly recommend this spot. The rare beef and tendon Pho is next level. Also nice to see a family run restaurant who's keeping it real with the restaurant name. When it comes to Pho'Q and Pho'U - I'm Not so sure.... but one thing I do know - this joint is Pho Real. Always busy - but never too long a wait. Get over there! It's about 'Tai-m. I will be 'Bac !

After your meal - Don't forget to order an iced Vietnamese coffee to go. BOMB"}
{"text":"This is probably the best pho place in the GTA, I've tried all the popular pho places in the GTA, and this one is nothing like the others. I can taste they don't put alot of MSG in it. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Finally an authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Richmond Hill. This is the best Viet restaurant in the RH and Markham areas; owned by Vietnamese people.
There is a good selection of different things on the menu. Beside the menu items, they have \"specials\" hand written on the walls. 

1) Spring rolls: 2 rolls for $4. Their fish sauce was quite good; not overly salty like some other places. Spring rolls were small but we'll stuffed with meat. 
2) Banh cuon (steamed rice rolls, on special menu written on the wall): was on point. This is my fav viet dish and not too many restaurants offer this so I was very excited to find out they do serve that here. 
The skin was nice and thin and stuffed with minced pork; served with veggies and fish sauce. They come in 2 sizes: small or large. Yum!!!!
3) Pho: authentic; broth was so good; I couldn't stop slurping it. Decent amount of noodles and meat. And price was a bit cheaper than other viet restaurants.
4) Bun Rieu (tomato based noodle soup): also another item on special menu. Broth tastes home made; I enjoyed it; however, it could use a bit more meat.

We ordered four items which was a bit too much food for two people but we wanted to try everything on the menu. Bill came out only about $30. This restaurant is a bit out of my way but definitely will return for more authentic Viet food"}
{"text":"It's a new pho place in Richmond Hill. Prices are good and comparable to most established Vietnamese restaurants in GTA. Small place. Simple decor.  Sign is not visible from Yonge which may affect the traffic on this place.  We ordered the large Pho #39, crispy rolls and the grilled chicken, grilled pork chop, steamed egg with rice. Good food, good service. Why 4 stars?  I find the pork chop and grilled chicken thinly sliced but big portion of rice. Who needs a lot of rice but less meat?  It's still enjoyable but can use some improvements on food servings."}
{"text":"Pho Tai Bac could be considered of having the best & most authentic Vietnamese Pho and Vietnamese cuisine in the GTA, including Richmond Hill, Vaughan, Markham.  We come here on every Saturday since their opening in Richmond Hill and we have never been disappointed. The service is a plus, the place is clean, the basil, sprouts that accompany the Pho are always fresh. The staff is friendly.
Plenty of parking. 
We are really happy to have it extended North.   We have stopped driving to Jane & Wilson."}
{"text":"Probably the best pho place in the GTA. Its always busy during dinner, but the food comes really quickly, so we've never had to wait too long. The decor is a little lacking, but it's not a big deal imo."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has a lot of good reviews. My experience definitely did not see the high star rating. First of all the cleanliness could be better, it was busy but overall the tables and chairs seems a bit dirty. The service was a little on the slow side. Next, the food was disappointing, got pho which is very typical from restaurant to restaurant but where they failed was the soup was not hot enough. So what that means, the rare beef would  not get cooked even though I mixed in the beef into the soup as soon as it arrived.  In terms of ingredients, it was a lot of noodle but doesn't seem to have a lot of everything else especially when some of the meat would not cook.  

Definitely had better Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Love their pho, always had me craving for more pho everyday, friendly staff. Their soup base is delicious, but doesn't leave you thirsty later. I kind of didn't want to share this place since I'm here pretty often. Good Inexpensive food. Lots of parking, food comes really quickly, so if you are starving, good place to be."}
{"text":"Just an average Pho place with relatively small portion compare to their price.  The only good thing is they have banh cuon ( steam rice roll) and Banh Xeo (Vietnamese pankcake)Broth is a bit on the bland side.  We come back again if I Have craving for Banh Cuon."}
{"text":"One of the best pho places I've been, very tender and generous meat portions, and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Not been to Pho for a bit so off we were to Little Saigon and what do you know, it seems to be closed down!  Newspaper taped to the window and the open sign not lit kind of gave me a clue - no escaping this sharp mind!  Still needs to be verified but it didn't look good.
Turned away and disappointed, it was Swiss Chalet time - ugh!
As we started down Yonge Street, we spotted this place.  Had to try it.
The place is relatively new - seems that they took over from a recently closed joint.  The least they could have done was put on a coat of paint.  Nonetheless, we're here for Pho and not the decorations.
We ordered the Large Pho with brisket and rare beef, the pork chop and rice, the shrimp and pork rolls and the spring rolls.
The large pho looked kind of small.  Mostly broth in a larger bowl.  The pork chop was season well and served kind of lukewarm - it came so quick, it looked like it was on a warmer. Even the Pho was not that hot.
The spring rolls were ok and the cold roll was passable.
For convenience, this place is close and we may try it again."}
{"text":"Came here for some late night pho. The broth has a light flavour. It is flavoured very mildly of herbs and anise, but it was still decent. If I had to compare, the broth is similar to xe lua. It was on the oilier side however. If it was just me, I'd give this place a 8/10.. however..

My girlfriend also had a pho and was complaining how she hated the broth and her noodles were too overcooked. I thought it was strange as i thought it was pretty good and we usually agree if a pho is good or not.. near the end of our meal I tried to taste some of hers. Wow. The broth was super oily and almost had no taste to it and the noodles could be broken by pressing on it with my tongue. It was strange how even though we ordered the same thing, it was so so inconsistent. My only guess is that hers was maybe from a freshly made pot of broth and was scooped from the very top.. also with old leftover noodles.
