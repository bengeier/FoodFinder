{"text":"We got a flyer on our door saying that they deliver. We went to their website to place our order, and a pop-up said that we were 5.1 miles from the restaurant and they only deliver within 5.0 miles, and we would need to call to place our order. I called and the lady on the phone asked for my zip code and when I gave it to her she immediately answered, no we don't deliver to that zip code. Don't go around placing flyers in an area that you don't deliver to. You're wasting paper and my time."}
{"text":"Has the health department ever visited this place. The bathrooms were hideous, the food was bland.  I was skeptical just walking in because the place was t very clean, but decided to give it a chance.  Staff was unfriendly, or just unhappy-- not sure. If I had used the restroom first I would never had tried the food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Shower up a little hour after ordering. Tried to double charge me. Forgot 1/3 of my order  and completely messed the other part of the order. Food is sub par. Deliver driver felt the urge to come thru my back gate and let my dog go running. So very disappointed."}
{"text":"VEGETARIANS BEWARE....DO NOT GO HERE!!  I am only speaking from the experience of one dish, but that is enough.  The \"vegetable\" selection on the menu at this steamtable type (It looked like it was set up for steamtable service  but all of the steam trays were empty when I went in today) restaurant is very small, but Ma Po Tofu is generally a safe bet.  I ordered it to go, took it home and began digging into it without really examining it.  I noticed some lumpy stuff, but just thought it to be clumps of rice and kept eating.  The sauce was flavorful, I was starving...and then my girlfriend asked if I was eating meat.  I realized then that the lumpy stuff was not clumps of rice or some other non-meat thing but rather some kind of unidentifiable meat.  I have never seen a non-vegetarian Ma Po Tofu before -- a dish that generally screams \"vegetarian.\"  Needless to say, I stopped eating immediately.  Unfortunately, I had consumed a good amount of food before realizing that it had meat in it.  Now it's time to settle back and hope that sickness doesn't come.  I did have a spoonful of their \"vegetable\" fried rice.  That was not very flavorful at all.  ***NOTE:  Noodles Ranch (Vietnamese) is right next door to this place.  It is very vegetarian friendly and has excellent food and ambiance.  Unfortunately they were closed this afternoon, so I could not go there."}
{"text":"Let me say first that I love Chinese food and its hard to not impress me. With that said, this place was gross.  I came in at lunch around 11:00am and was the only person in there. Their lunch menu has a lot but its strange: you get the main food, then you have to choose between a drink OR an egg roll OR a soup. Other places its usually all three for the lunch menu.   I ordered shrimp with garlic sauce and a large hot and sour soup because that's what I really came for and I can seriously put away Chinese food. It took what seemed like at least 10 minutes so I'm starting to think that it will come out fresh and incredible. You can see where they're cooking...looks like they're hard at work back there.  The person who took my order at the register brings the soup first then the plate of food. I hadn't noticed until I got the food but they have buckets of silverware on the table. I wasn't sure if they were used or not, but they looked used. However there were so many on each table that certainly they all couldn't have been used. I was also kind of taken aback that they serve on styrofoam plates. No big deal just that I hadn't seen that in a long time.  I start eating the shrimp with garlic sauce. I quickly find that I don't detect any garcle whatsoever. Maybe because I love garlic and they only put enough in for a normal person. I don't know. I also soon find that it tastes like one of those microwaveable Chinese meals I could have gotten at the store a couple hundred feet away from their frozen section. Ah well, I eat it all anyway.  I get to the hot and sour soup: again, what I had really come for because I had been craving it for some time and has become my measuring stick for Chinese places. First slurp: no flavor. Nothing. Ok? I put some soy sauce. Kind of better. So I'm eating it, watching a little of their TV as I go when I noticed something strange. I don't know if it was uncooked egg or some sort of gellatanous goup but there was some clear junk in the soup. I already paid for it and I got the impression they wouldn't care if I told them, so I scoup it out and put on my plate. I continue eating the soup and find more and more. And what I think was chicken in there starts to resemble children's fingers that may have slipped in. This is no bueno!  Another thing. Their drinks. They give you a styrofoam cup to fill yourself which is cool, but they don't have a lid for that size. Makes me think they purposefully did this so you wouldn't take any drink with you.  I work around here and this could have been my go to place but I won't ever be coming back. It makes my stomach feel weird just thinking about what I ate. I hope I don't get sick later on.  Yes, it could have been a bad day for them. It was Friday maybe they were all excited, I don't know. But I'm not going to chance it."}
{"text":"I have only had delivery from Yummy Yummy. The food always arrives before they say it will. Everything I have ordered has always been excellent. I will keep ordering from here as long as they will keep delivering to me."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for a while. In the beginning it was great, but the last few times it was lacking, food not as tastey. I am so sad, it really was my favorite for awhile. Back to Totties I guess."}
{"text":"Loooove the pork fried egg rolls!  Best chinese food I've tasted here in phx... They deliver fast and the food is delicious... Defenetly recomend eating here...and since I'm from NY the food here makes me feel like back home..."}
{"text":"Sorry yummy yummy, I'm hoping what I ate stays in my tummy.  We had food delivered (which was free of charge--nice!) and it arrived close to when promised.  It was almost cold, which seemed a little odd for a quick delivery from 3 miles away.  Other than being cold the food looked really good, but the Little Lady immediately noticed the cashews she had paid an extra $2 for were not included in her meal.  Boo.  Then I had my first bite of General Tso's chicken...and it tasted like battered packing peanuts!  Holy great wall it was bad, worst Generals chicken I ever had.  No flavor whatsoever.  I was starving so I doused it in hot sauce and soy sauce (don't even try the duck sauce--not sure of it's composition but not good) and scarfed some down and tossed the rest.  And now I sit here waiting, wishing, and hoping my iron stomach comes through and I avoid any double dragon action over the next 12 hours.  Wish me luck."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food is hard to find in Arizona....unless you go to Yummy Yummy! We found this place & gave it a try for delivery. They delivered fast! even though they said it would be 45 mins. They are consistently good. The prices are decent. I was concerned when I saw the containers-they looked small, but you'd be surprised how much they hold & when Chinese tastes good, it fills you up. We've been ordering there since the first night we found them. I don't know if I could try any others again!   :)"}
{"text":"Had I known this place was filthy dirty on the inside, I never woild have ordered takeout! When I walked in I noticed meat, uncooked raw meat, just sitting on the kitchen counter for who knows how long. The checkout counter and everything on it were black with dirt not to mention cleaning supplies on the floor next to to go containers and cups."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and fresh food. I order here at least once a week and have not once been let down. Try the chicken teryaki."}
{"text":"Good little take-out restaurant. Visited it for the first time Christmas evening. It was very busy, but the staff was friendly and hard working. Food took a little while, but was worth the wait. I will be going back again."}
{"text":"Always have our food delivered abut once a week. Service is fast and well packaged. Food is always good, hot, and fresh.  Just ordered again!! AAA...excellent late night delivery!!  Food was so good and fresh.....!!!!!   I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Serving items we ordered on delivery we ordered one large plate and a small on another and the containers we got our food were exactly the same but was charged more for large. And called them and they said that both were different sizes but it was the same . Good was cold and a lot pricier and not worth the price for small portions to me it wasn't worth the money and price never again  rip off of a place save your money on a better place.. 2 thumbs down..."}
{"text":"Tasted a little bit greasier than most Chinese food, but it was pretty good. The best part is you can order online now which is awesome because then I don't have to call or worry about them getting my order wrong because English is their second language! Not quite like New York Chinese food but still good for the price especially. I would recommend this maybe once a month or so just because it could be a little bit too greasy and upset your stomach."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious!  ....and talk about fast! We didn't know what to expect, but this little place completely delivered!  If your looking for authentic, fresh Chinese food and want it NOW, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I would like to begin this review by saying that I went to it with an open mind. I had been wanting to go try this place out since I came home one day to find a menu taped to my front door. All the dishes were priced reasonably and the restaurant was about five minutes from my apartment. I read all the reviews on here before going, and upon seeing that they were mostly mixed reviews I decided to go and check it out once and for all. The menu states clearly at the top that the place is under new management, and from what I know, that usually means that the place should be running better than ever. Not in this case.  When I first got there, I noticed that there weren't very many people in the restaurant besides a couple sitting in one of the booths. There were two gentlemen ahead of me, the first had a large take-out order, the second ordered to dine-in.   My turn came to order. All I wanted was Chow Mein with Beef. Simple enough, right? I had to repeat my order to the girl behind the counter four times, on the fourth I pointed to the menu where the Chow Mein choices were featured. She nodded and then asked me if I wanted a large or a small dish. I asked her how big the containers were and she didn't seem to understand what I was asking. I asked her again, slowly, and she nodded and pointed at the containers behind her. I ordered a small, it seems like a good proportion. I paid my $11, got my drink, and sat down at a booth.  The surface of the table was sticky, but I chalked it up to the waiting staff just having overlooked it. I wiped the surface with a napkin and waited for my food to arrive. An older Asian woman approached me with a plate full of food, and I was impressed with how quickly she brought it over. She said something that I didn't understand and I asked her to repeat it. Finally, I realized she was saying Kung Pow Chicken. I shook my head and told her that I hadn't ordered that. She insisted that the chicken was my order, despite the fact that the gentleman who had been in front of me at the register was waving her over, claiming the dish as his.  The lady laughed and took it over to him.  The girl who took my order came back over to ask me what I had ordered, and I repeated my order to her. She smiled and said she would go tell them in the kitchen.   A young Asian man, after another five minutes of waiting, brought me a paper plate with beef and broccoli. He put in front of me and before I could say thank you, he said, \"Sorry, not yours\" and walked away.  The older Asian lady came out once more and brought me the same dish that the boy had just brought over and said this was my order. I asked her what it was and she said that it was what I ordered. I asked her if this was Chow Mein with Beef because from what I could see, there were no noodles anywhere to be seen. The lady pointed to the girl and said that she told her I had ordered what she put before me.  I should probably say that I hardly ever make a big deal about not getting exactly what I want at a restaurant, but everyone at this restaurant seemed to be clueless as to what I had ordered even after I repeated the order multiple times.  I told the lady that I had not ordered the beef dish she placed in front of me. I thanked her and told her to forget it. I stood up to leave and she told me to sit down, quite rudely, and that she would get a manager. I shook my head and told her that it was fine, it wasn't a big deal, but that I was leaving. She kept telling me to sit down, very loudly now, and she ran back to the kitchen. I simply walked out of the restaurant without even asking for a refund. I doubt they would have been able to handle a simple transaction like returning my $11.  I drove a couple of blocks over to Panda Express after that."}
{"text":"This place should change their name to \"yummy yummy hair in tummy\" if you're into disgusting cold Chinese food with complimentary hair cooked into the dumplings this is your jam!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner and had Kung pao chicken takeout. The girl working the counter was very friendy. I loved her!  The food was good overall and spicy enough for me (which is rare). The portion size was generous. The only issue I had (and its a big one) is that the quality of chicken was poor at best. The pieces were small, not very tasty and a few of them were gristly which tends to be an appetite suppressant. Not the best Chinese in the Area."}
{"text":"Egg drop soup was awesome. Get extra teriyaki sauce is you order anything with it. But good other than that. Very fast delivery."}
{"text":"Last night we took out wonton soup & chicken chow mein. We could not eat the soup. The amount of salt in it was disgusting. I specifically ordered the chow mein with no garlic & light on the onions. They put sooo much garlic in it & onions that it was repeating on me all night. This has happened many times when we ordered food from there. My mom asked for no pepper in the shrimp with lobster sauce. There was tons of pepper in it. She can't eat spicy foods. There shouldn't be pepper in that dish anyway. My dad asked for low salt in the lo mein. Again they didn't listen & made it so salty. He is not allowed to have all that salt. We will not be going back there. I don't understand why they can't make the food the way we like it. Their menu says all dishes can be altered to your taste. I'm originally from ny/nj & I know how chinese food should taste."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and very fast service, best Chinese food we found in Scottsdale, we love so much ! :)"}
{"text":"The ambiance might be sad and the customer service poor, but I really think Yummy Yummy is yummy! I like how they make my General Tsos chicken crispy. Their cold sesame noodles are fantastic. The option of half orders is also great. Its the Chinese food I remember growing up with in Manhattan, NYC."}
{"text":"The other reviews are harsh. I liked the food, amazing portion in the cool plastic containers. I live in Flagstaff and was getting our resort on in Scottsdale. The delivery guy met us at the lobby, good enough."}
{"text":"Awesome food (I was raised in NYC Chinatown) and very tasty, ordering is a dream and have always had my order down perfect. Fried appetizers are never over done (hint hint Asia Lee) even the soda is ice cold when delivered. Good balance with meats and veggies. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE A THING!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this place.  It's cheap and they give you good portions too.  I'm originally from the east coast and this is the only place that truly delivered that ny/Philly kind of greasy Chinese that I crave.  Things have also gotten better under the new management.  While I don't think I would ever do a sit down meal here, it is great for takeout."}
{"text":"Good basic Chinese takeout. We ended up here instead of the Pho place next door as it was closed, and it was pretty good. The place was clean, food hot and tasty, and the staff friendly. Next time we want Chinese food, we'll try them for delivery.   As for the guy who whined about the person on the phone who spoke no english, give her a break, I'm sure it was the girl who served us, she was really nice, and her english was just fine.  If the wait at LoLo's down the way is too long, this place is a nice option."}
{"text":"I have long been in search for a chinese delivery place that can do a good mu-shu. I typically order from New China Gate, great food but mu-shu is not an option. When I got a menu for this place in my mail box I thought \"let's give it go.\" Bad idea. The mu-shu was bland and had a bad texture. We also ordered the crab rangoon, they were awful, very thin and the little bit of filling they did have was overcooked and rubbery. The sweet and sour sauce even had a weird flavor. I'll stick with New Chine gate, but if your are reading this please make a mu-shu,"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend love this place. They are really nice and the portions are awesome. Very satisfying!  They have me the wrong rice on my order and fixed it with no problems. I would recommend them to everyone!"}
{"text":"Still obsessed with the pan fried pork dumplings.  Have now discovered the chicken moo goo gai pan...so good! Chicken is very tender and the sauce is light.  Food is always delivered super hot and well within the estimated time.  Dumplings and moo goo are my go to order for sure!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised (3.5)!  I was worried when I saw the so-so reviews, but I decided to give it a shot since I was close by.  They have plenty of veggie/tofu dishes.  The sesame tofu came out good and FINALLY a Chinese place that automatically adds broccoli to the dish!  They also can substitute brown rice instead of white for free.  Btw, the staff is actually really nice.  Looking forward to returning to check out the lunch specials."}
{"text":"I have passed by this place for so long...I always go to Lolos, Noodle Ranch or Jamba Juice...but I knew I had to try it...I always pass by with their signs all over the windows...It was either going to be a good hole in the wall or something just terrible...I ordered the General Tsos chicken combo...to go...the restaurant is not very impressive...they have a few booths and a soda machine...you order your food and they will call you up to get it....they are very quick and fast...The food was pipping hot and it was prety good...it was good greasy chicken with fried rice!  The price is awesome for the combos and you get alot of food...I didnt think that I got that much food but I did!  It was good...ill be back for those nights that I want to stay in and watch movies have wine with my greasy chinese!  YUM!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  We order delivery for my office staff all the time.  Probably used them over 30 times. Very good as far as delivery Chinese goes."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in Arizona and always super fast delivery!"}
{"text":"My opinion of this establishment is seriously tainted by the two and a half hours I had to wait to receive my food. Once my food arrived it was lukewarm at best, leading me to believe it spent quite some time sitting somewhere. The hot and sour soup once heated was good, the Pad Thai was not; very slimy. My boyfriend ordered general tsos chicken, which was good and good portion. All in all, I'll go somewhere else for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I ordered a few orders of white rice & chicken lo mein. There's no real way to mess up white rice so they were a shoe in. The chicken lomein was tasty. I asked them to make it spicy and they actually did. The delivery was pretty speedy and the woman was very polite. I'm a native New Yorker where there are Chinese restaurants EVERYWHERE so I'm sure that's why I wasn't used to the ridiculous prices."}
{"text":"Normally names like this keep me away from these type of Chinese restaurants,  but I thought I would give it a try.   I ordered off the menu and got a curry chicken that they combined for a lunch special.  To be honest, there was nothing remarkable about the meal and so my review is really one of indifference.  The food was hot and fresh, especially since I waited for it to take out, but there was nothing that would make this restaurant outstanding.  Scottsdale still has yet to possess a true gem of a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"They should rename this place Yucky Yucky! Nasty ass food, restaurant looks as if they live there. The lady that took our order was rude, she texted on her phone while she took our order, we had to ask where the utensils were, and as we ate the poorly cooked dog they mopped (Normally not a big deal) except it stunk of bleach. Man I'm not sure what people in this part of the state consider good Chinese food, but it's sure as fuck not this dumpster. You'll get better Chinese at your kids school cafeteria."}
{"text":"Very good & authentic. I worked a Chinese restaurant, and I have been to China. This is the 'real deal'."}
{"text":"This place is insane. I know it's Chinese and all, but the woman answering the phone doesn't know a lick of English. We spent 5 min on the phone just trying to give an address. And that's 5 minutes of my life I will never get back. Then out of sheer frustration (and hunger), I hung up on the incompetent operator. She then proceeded to call back no less than 5 times. If you are hungry, don't call them. But if you want a good laugh, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I like Chinese food. And this place was open on Christmas Eve. We went regardless of the 3 star rating and I'm pleased :)  My family dug in! We got a lot of food for 40 bucks."}
{"text":"The pricing and food are good. Large portions, with one dish feeding at least two people. The service leaves something to be desired. Typically they act extremely rushed and uninterested, and pleasantries are almost non-existent. Also, if you choose to order online for delivery, expect to wait, about an hour. We live about a mile away and have always waited at least that amount of time and usually the delivery doesn't occur until after we call them and get the \"our driver just left\" line.  Even ordering in restaurant can take some time for your meal to be ready. If you're looking for no frills, reasonably priced food, and do not care much about customer service and are not in a hurry...then you've found a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Chinese take-out is trial and error. In this case, Yummy Yummy was exactly that - trial and error.   Our first time with a Scottsdale Chinese takeout, my wife and I tried a sampling of less-expensive and more-expensive menu selections, thinking we'd have leftovers for the next day. Won tons in won ton soup were overly large and doughy - threw it out. Egg drop soup was tasteless - threw it out. Duck was good, but fatty; ate around the fat. Chicken with vegetables was okay - very mediocre. \"House-special\" fried rice was okay - but nothing special; not worth the extra cost.   Total cost: $50.00 for two with some leftovers for a third meal the next day. Not a good value nor a pleasant eating experience.  We'll be trying another establishment next time."}
{"text":"Big mistake ordering something with meat in this dive. The veggie fried rice is still good, but this is possibly the worst version of white meat chicken in the history of white meat chicken. It is slimy, and yellow color and inedible. This is what junky Chinese places do to your poultry. It must cost them a dollar around or I'm not even sure where this stuff comes from. An absolute mess. If you have any self respect and trust me a little, please do not order the chicken here. That chicken was in a dish of thin rice noodles which were equally disgusting. They tasted like someone throw a coating of old fish sauce on them and then served them up right from the ocean. It reeked of fish oil and juice and it was an injustice to serve this stuff to the public. Fried rice be damned, I'm taking my business as far away as possible from this punk ass fake ripoff place. New York would laugh this craphole out of the area code in a New York minute."}
{"text":"The veggies were fresh.  The deep fried shrimp were akin to eating cake-covered shrimp, and were not good.  The sauce was sticky and too sweet.  Ick..."}
{"text":"I am so desparate to find a good take-out chinese food place and this one just added to the list that failed me.  I ordered simple- things that aren't easy to screw up because I didn't want to be disapointed.  Chicken fried rice with extra egg & crab rangoons.  I made it very clear to the girl I wanted extra egg in my chicken fried rice several times, even paid extra for it.  When I got home I got rice and onions.  Not even the good onions (scallions) but massive chunks of white onion.  No chicken, hardly any egg, and no vegetables besides ONIONS.  Wtf?!!! How can you mess that up so bad?  I got crab rangoons with no sweet and sour sauce.  Like normal take-out places there were no utensils, no soy sauce, no nothing!  I hate to just rate a place simply on chicken fried rice but seriously.... get it together yummy yummy!"}
{"text":"Loved their egg drop soup.   They pump out some food.  Very busy, but we ordered to take out."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would. This food was disgusting and bland. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"prob the worst chin food we ever ate noticed guy sitting one booth over dumped his plate after a couple bites. fried rice tasteless & chicken stir fry rubbery.   live & learn"}
{"text":"I really don't know how you could have anything bad to say about this place. Great food that is reasonably priced and hot when it arrives. The delivery guys are so nice too.   My favorites are the walnut shrimp and the mushu shrimp. Great wontons and egg rolls too.   If you're hungry and want something fast and fresh without having to cook or go out, order from them! I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!  I ordered takeout - tofu veggie soup & tofu w/ brown rice and vegetables dinner.  SO GOOD!  The veggies were very fresh and I have enough to last me for 3-4 meals... huge portions.  The delivery was very quick - within 30 minutes of me placing the order.  I'm happy and satisfied!"}
{"text":"The most bland food ever.  Delivering was moderate... but to wait that long for super bland food sucks."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have not written a review for Yummy Yummy yet... This is my absolute favorite Chinese restaurant on the west coast!!!! The only thing better is in NYC so that's really saying something. I have had delivery from these guys a couple dozen times and occasionally I pick up too but I have never dinned in for some reason. I have never had a bad meal. Since moving away from Scottsdale I dream about yummy and when I visit arizona, this is my very first stop. Do yourself a favor and try out the best Chinese food on the west coast :)"}
{"text":"The best Chinese in south Scottsdale by far!!!!!! Crazy enough it almost seems like it's made by Chinese people. I mean that's a very good thing. I can dig it. Fast delivery! Everything I've had there is legit. NY style y'all.  C.hinese food  R. ules E.verything A.round M.e Get the boneless pork ribs!"}
{"text":"I want this review to be seen as the best constructive criticism I can give to a place with so much potential. For those of you not familiar with the area, the location of this business is absolutely amazing. Two major crossroads in Scottsdale, great traffic from big stored next door and quite simply, a great little place.  However, keep in mind that people shop with their eyes. That said, when you walk into a business, that first impression makes a huge impact on many things. Let me give you a summary:  When you walk in, you'll see that they have turned the place into a warehouse to keep all of their inventory (drinks, food, plastic cups, napkins, etc...) but instead of having a designated storage room for that, everything is just all over the place (around the tables, vending machine, register, counter, etc...). My advice to the owners/managers is simple. Please keep the place organized, make it look like a place to eat and make people want to sit down and enjoy a nice meal over there. One of the employees was cutting veggies on one of the tables for customers. I really hope they take my review as good feedback and not as bad feedback. They have so much potential, a little organization, clearing up and cleaning up with go insanely far.  The food itself isn't bad at all. Prices are affordable and they have a huge menu, you can pretty much eat anything Chinese that comes to mind there! I've never had an issue with the food, but I always get it to go."}
{"text":"Always a problem with delivery. I have tried to give them many chances . Tonight is my 5th try. No more . Shame on me for trying then five times. If you like receiving your food late and cold then just do phone order with this place . Let me add this time I even had to go find the driver ."}
{"text":"It's taken me over 7 years but I've finally found a decent Chinese restaurant in Scottsdale. Their food is delicious (we had Mongolian Beef, Veggie Lo Mein and Moo Goo Gai Pan) and tastes fresh and not salty. We ordered delivery. Our food arrived hot, the delivery guy was professional and nice. He even met me at the entrance of our building rather than make we walk to meet him at then management office (we live in a condo, no one can ever find our building including Grub Hub). I love Chinese food and Yummy Yummy is definitely my new go to for great Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I was not expecting much from this Chinese restaurant seeing as how there were some negative reviews on here mainly about delivery it seems but I was pleasantly surprised with their food. The house special fried rice + broccoli chicken were actually great choices even compared to some of the other Chinese restaurants in the area. I believe their closing hours are actually until 10 PM on most weekdays despite the 9:30 PM closing time that's mentioned on here.  Never ordered delivery from here so I'm not sure what that's like but the pickup/takeout was very convenient for me. The prices are very reasonable and portions were generous. I would order from here again if I'm in the mood for some Chinese food."}
{"text":"I have had delivery from this place two times now and both times I was extremely impressed. Servings are huge and the food is always hot when it comes to my door. If you are looking for filling Chinese takeout this is the place. The containers the food come in are awesome for heating up left overs the next day! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"4 stars might be a little high, most of the things I've had were pretty....okay. Specifically, the Kung Pao chicken (my bellwether for Chinese) is average at best. The standouts so far have been the Hot and Sour soup (very good, I always grab a quart) and the Mai Fun. The online ordering system is very good and convenient."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pu Pu Platter for two as well as the tofu with vegetables plate. I was not exactly impressed. The food was delivered to my door and a few of the packages were either damaged or haphazardly taped together since they wouldn't close all the way. Now for the food. It was... not the best. I could feel my stomach yelling at me as I ate it. I wouldn't try this place again."}
{"text":"Ick and Boo!  My two thoughts after bite one of my take-out dinner.  After eating a lot of average Chinese food in Scottsdale, we were excited to try this new place.  When I called to place my order, I was a little shocked to find out that all but one of the entrees listed in the \"Vegetable\" dinner section contained some kind of meat or fish product.   So I ordered the only option I had tofu and mixed vegetables in a brown soy sauce, and requested they add cashew nuts.  He informed me that it would be $2, and I said that was fine.  When our food arrived, my dish had no cashew nuts... \"Boo\", it also had no flavor whatsoever \"Ick\".  In fact, after taking a few bites, I began to be concerned about the quality of the food, as it was loaded with veggies and sauce, and really had no flavor at all...something was wrong here.   I ate about 5 bites total and threw it away, I didn't want to risk getting sick over it. Hottie did the same and we ate a few pieces of cheese for dinner instead.  Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food for inexpensive delivery.  Ordered from GrubHub.  In the process of moving, too tired to cook or get takeout.  The beans, chicken and beef were fine; standard Americanized fare.  Yummy could save money by providing less rice.  We dumped it.  Yes if desperate again, we will order from Yummy.  The beans were tender chrisp."}
{"text":"For the amount of food that you get, I don't see why people are complaining. You do get a lot of food. Obviously with take out Chinese Food it is hit-or-miss and from what I have ordered, the food is good enough to go back. My favorite thing to order is an order of Crab Rangoon with General Tso's Chicken. It is moderately priced and I still order from here once or twice a month."}
{"text":"so gross. hard chow mein, didnt get my fried rice and the food was soaked in sweet gross sauce, my crispy chicken was soggy. i asked for spicy and got sugar soup."}
{"text":"had delivery from Yummy  last night - food was hot, expertly packaged, and tasty,,,,,,, yeah the egg rolls are a little greasy, but it's hard to keep that fryer oil hot when it is in constant use.   I had the  Triple Delight -  jumbo shrimp, chicken, and beef with variety of vegetables in brown sauce; very good, though i would have liked garlic in the sauce. Mos def will order from there again."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning - twice! Yes I said twice!  The 2nd time they where super cheap with portions too and filled in the box with white rice on the bottom to make it look full!        The first time I had food from here I was actually impressed. The food was tasty and still relatively warm after the 45 min wait. But then I got the S**!. I didnt put my finger on Yummy Yummy right away  but thought it was suspect.       About 6 days later I wanted to give it another shot. This is when they gypt me out of the food as stated above. However, the same night and next day - I got the sh^*! Again! My guts hurt as I am writing this since I am on day two of not holding down food. F*!# This Place!"}
{"text":"We have had a really hard time finding any good delivery Asian food since we moved here. For delivery, Yummy Yummy has good food for a great price. The chicken and veggies are always fresh and we have been thrilled the 3 times that we have ordered from them."}
{"text":"I use live in New York and go to Chinatown all the time. This place is a huge disappointment. Don't order from here if you want to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"I used to order here once every few months, so not much, but one time they said they could not deliver at all because they were busy.  I chose not to give them my business for a year or so.  Well now they started delivering flyers again, which makes me believe business is slow, so I gave them one last chance, bad choice, the food was less than satisfactory, one example being, I ordered war wonton soup, and received ZERO wonton.  I gave the second chance when I normally would not, big mistake!  Seals the deal for me, will never give my business again.  Wish I could give negative stars."}
{"text":"This place is descent. There aren't many Chinese food places in the area and does it job when Chinese is on the mind. Although the ambience is far from delightful it makes a nice in and out place for take out on the way home and the service ,although lacking in the friendliness category, is quite fast. The first time I ordered here it did not make a memorable impression but while craving Chinese I gave it another shot, that and it's just so darn convenient. I have found something I like and stick to that, chicken and broccoli and crab Rangoon..  I've had better crab puffs butt I've also had worse, they are a little sweet but the ratio is perfect. The chicken and broccoli is a little to saucy but no bad enough to make me never come back and the broccoli is always cooked perfectly. Egg rolls are sub par. I don't even bother with them anymore.   Bottom line Decent take out, not bad enough to never go back but I will be far from loyal if another new decently priced place in the area opens up."}
{"text":"Ok, I am reviewing this so I will go with 3 stars.  If my boyfriend were reviewing he would give it no more than 1 star.  Especially after getting sick because of it.  Here is the difference... Both times we have eaten here I have had the tofu dishes.  1st time was sesame tofu with brown rice and the 2nd time was Mongolian tofu with brown rice.  Both times, I thoroughly enjoyed the tofu.  The meals are greasy delicious chinese fast food and I can have leftovers the next day.  My bf ordered chicken dishes.  The 1st time he ordered the orange chicken.  I tried it and it was ok, but 1 bite was enough for me and I ended up sharing some of my tofu dish with him.  The 2nd time he ordered yellow curry chicken.  It was bland in every aspect,  The color of the curry sauce was dull, the spice and flavor of the curry was light, and the consistency of the curry sauce was watery.  The chicken had a weird taste and texture and he ended up only eating a few bites and I had to give up a big portion of my tofu.  Later that night he started complaining about not feeling well, and ended up getting sick.  He normally has a strong stomach.  So, Yummy Yummy, I will be fair and give you 3 stars strictly for your tofu dishes.  I enjoy my friday nights when my bf and I get take out and watch a movie, but it looks like I will be doing it alone if I want to order from your restaurant again."}
{"text":"Very interesting little place. Service was meh but the food was even worse. Some of chicken I got did not look very edible. I picked through it and only ate the vegetables. Will probably never go back"}
{"text":"I like this place. I placed an order to go. Service was quick and friendly and the place seemed pretty clean. The Hot and Sour soup was not very hot or sour (fixed with chili oil and white vinegar at home). The ingredients were quality though, you could tell the mushrooms were fresh and not from a can. The pork dumplings were clearly from scratch, and they were good. I ordered the spicy beef. It wasn't very spicy but the ingredients were quality again, seemed fresh and the veggies hand cut. Next time I'll ask for extra spicy and see how it goes."}
{"text":"Think of the name of the restaurant as an oxymoron and you're on the right track.  Disgusting food, cheap ingredients, unfriendly staff, and pathetic dining area.  I lived on this food when I was broke 2 years ago and I regret it, I'd have rather gone into debt."}
{"text":"Well I am disappointed the food was below average.  I guess we had an old menu and I said the name and number but numbers changed so he place the order just on numbers. I am glad that we did not order what showed up it looked like I tried to cook it and forgot it in the fryer. Greasiest dumpling I have ever seen.  I should have taken a picture. We usually order China Wok every Sunday they were closed for Easter so we called yummy yummy huge mistake.... Next holiday we will just make food."}
{"text":"It's pretty good considering the insulting Chinese name of the restaurant.  Have ordered many dishes and they have been better than expected and always show up fast.  The garlic chicken or orange chicken are always my go to!  I use to always order from chop n wok because I lived in North Scottsdale..  That was nasty. Yummy is so much better!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you something.....I have been in Arizona for 7 years. I came from New York City.....do not tell me that there is a better Chinese take out spot on this side of the country than Yummy Yummy. I have put on my David Caradine Kung Fu Slippers and traversed the State of Arizona, Seattle Washington and Southern California....... ALL OF THE OTHER TAKE OUT PLACES WERE Terrible. Yummy Yummy is where its at BRO!  Fried Rice and Boneless Spare Ribs combo....GIMME DA EGG ROLLS PUHLEASE!"}
{"text":"I love the hot n' sour soup!!! My favorite! My husband loves the orange shrimp. Baby craves the veggie spring rolls jeje I'm prego and I'm always craving them. We always order delivery and sometimes they take up to an hour but it's worth it! Portions are big, we always have left overs:) Thank you guys for AWSOME food! Keep it up! 5 stars to the hot n' sour soup and the veggie spring rolls:D"}
{"text":"Not even gonna front...this place is legit. Pan fried dumplings = best around and probably a contender for best fried dumplings for value anywhere. Plump, delicious,meaty, and may be a tad bit oily but dabbing with napkins or setting on napkins will help this. Great dumplings!   Yang chow fried rice on point. Not salty, not mushy but flavorful and hearty as it should be. The lo mein is also hearty and plentiful. The beef fried rice also the same. The one thing I need to point out is this place does NOT skimp on the meat. Perhaps a little too much in fact, which is never a bad thing. Generous portions and even healthier portions of chicken/beef/protein!   I also ordered mapo tofu and was super surprised at how not oily it was and normally you don't get soft tofu but you do here.   I like the attention to detail and the friendly service and delivery came way in advance of expectation."}
{"text":"Having an Asian wife, I am pretty snobby when it comes to Chinese food. I also grew up in NY so I know what real Chinese food taste like. No not all NY Chinese food is good but, when your wife is Asian and lived in NY as well, you know where to go.   Yummy Yummy is just that, Yummy. It's good American Chinese food, the stuff I used to get on Long Island in the local Chinese take out before I  met my wife.  I thoroughly enjoyed and, will most definitely be back. Service was fast too."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this restaurant multiple times and have never had an inaccurate delivery. They are fast, courteous and so so YUMMY! Orders come fresh and hot, and our requests to leave/add certain ingredients are always honored. Leftovers heat up very well, even after day two, which isn't the case for many restaurant orders."}
{"text":"My First time in Scottsdale was last weekend. I was craving Chinese food and after reading reviews from several sources I decided to try Yummy Yummy. At first everything seemed fine I finished my meal and left, but as time passed I began feeling sicker and sicker. By the next morning I was running a fever, in pain and keeping nothing down. I without a doubt had food poisoning and will not be dining at yummy yummy again."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with this place. Ordered delivery tonight and got the pu pu platter, chicken with garlic sauce, house fried rice, and General tsos chicken. The pu pu platter tasted like poo poo. The chicken with garlic sauce had a ton of vegetables and not a whole lot of chicken. The sauce was good though. The house fried rice was decent, but some of the pork was chewy. General tsos was so-so. Not sure if I'd go back."}
{"text":"Just had a disappointing experience hoping that the good reviews were enough to overshadow the bad ones.  We ordered the mu-shu pork which is one of my personal faves, fried dumplings, fried pork rolls, thai panang curry with beef and the chicken and broccoli with some won ton soup.  Here's the low-down: Mu-Shu Pork: Very disappointed.  The flavor was slightly fake in nature and had a strange/not good aftertaste.  It was also missing the sweet sauce it usually comes with that makes it delectable. Fried Dumplings: Were very tasty, but the dough was VERY thick.  I felt my arteries closing while eating them. Fried Pork Roll: Also very tasty, but VERY greasy.  You can tell you're eating something fried. Thai Panang Curry with beef: Very tasty, BF gobbled it up without much communication.  It wasn't exactly the flavor he was looking for, wanting more of the curry flavor, but it was good enough for him to finish it in record time. Chicken and broccoli: The chicken tastes fake with that chewy consistency that most chinese places boast in their \"chicken\" dishes making me wonder whether I'm eating chicken...or some other white meat...the broccoli was fresh and crisp even if it was doused in too much sauce. Won Ton Soup: Had plenty in my time and this was just wrong. It tasted as if they made it with butter, which turned me off instantly. Otherwise a pretty uninspiring meal.  Ended up throwing most of it away.  2 stars for the 2 dishes that were ok."}
{"text":"I think my husband is growing tired of Fiesta Burrito:(  So as to not turn this dire situation into a full-blown emergency, I suggested we order Chinese.  Well, we don't know of all that many places nearby, so Yummy Yummy it is.  We ordered take-out and I was glad as the restaurant is very small, and not so nice.  However, our order was ready before we could even drive there.  As for the food...it was A-okay.  The hot & sour soup was very good and great given our frigid temperatures lately.  The beef pepper steak would have been terrific had the beef just a little more flavor on its own.  Sweet & sour chicken...well isn't it all the same?  I was wishing there were pineapple & bell peppers in the mix though.  Just a box of lonely chicken with sauce on the side.  The only disappointment, the fried wontons for the soup were cold, over-fried, and just not good.  I really hated myself for eating them...all of them....the whole bag.  But anything resembling a chip is at risk in my house."}
{"text":"Again another great dinner from yummy yummy. This time we decided to have it delivered, and it arrived in 20 minutes instead of the 45 they said it would. This is the best Chinese food in south Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  I REALLY want to find a good Chinese food place in the Old Town/South Scottsdale area, and I am still not in luck.  True, there is no atmosphere, but I don't really care.  Also true that the service is less than friendly.  Whatever-- I have lower expectations for a place from which I really only intend to mostly order takeout.  Quick rundown:   Crab rangoon is okay.  A little thin, but the quality of the fried dough part is pretty good. Duplings (like potstickers) are okay.  The dough is good, but the meat inside isn't awesome... it was fine, though. Chicken fried rice was okay. The best thing was the orange chicken.  It was a little too breaded and a little too stringy for my taste (I am totally spoiled by Pei Wei), but the flavor was pretty good, and it had enough of a spicy kick for me.    All of the above, plus 2 soft drinks was $28.  Not bad.  So I would probably go back, but only if I just need to eat something quickly."}
{"text":"Ordered a pork egg roll and chicken with curry sauce. Paid 2$ extra for sub fried rice and $3 extra for shrimp.  Didn't get the shrimp."}
{"text":"EASILY my favorite Chinese delivery in Old Town Scottsdale. This is the only place I get delivery from and I have never had a bag experience. My girlfriend and I always get orange chicken, sweet and sour pork, lo mein, and fried rice and it is great every time. We have also had their sweet and sour chicken, which is my \"test item\" for every Chinese place, and it is delicious as well. Delivery is very prompt and the service is friendly. Big fan of Yummy Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Ordered teriyaki chicken combo but somehow they decided to give me white rice instead of fried rice... really disappointed.... but to be fair, their teriyaki chicken isn't bad. The sauce is pretty tasty.  Many people mentioned their fried potsticker so I decided to give it a try... not impressed at all.... but again, the sauce is way better than others' that I've tried else where. The potsticker is a meh.....  a little tip: when order delivery, make sure you check the order before they leave just in case"}
{"text":"Good food and fast delivery!  Used the Eat24 online ordering right through yelp and it was easy, breezy!!"}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy is right! This spot makes some very good Chinese cuisine. I usually order the Sweet n Sour pork, Broccoli Beef, or Teriyaki Chicken, which are repeatedly offered in just about every other Asian restaurant. But, Yummy seems to do it better :D  Delivery is very quick! IT usually only takes about 20 minutes to deliver to my business in Old Town. And the prices are unbeatable for the amount of food you receive.. they really hook it up! One delivery usually lasts me three to four meals!  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Great chinese food, fast delivery. Delivery guy is friendly, good prices!! I tried shrimp dishes, pork dishes, chicken, everything is great. Lo mein is the bomb."}
{"text":"Had a great experience for the first time with Yummy Yummy Chinese food it was fresh and delicious...Although my husband and I didn't care for our soups he had hot and sour I had egg drop, had an unnatural  strange taste unfortunately... No problem, we will continue going there for the main dishes..."}
{"text":"Was surprised this was not horrible.  It's right next to the Blockbuster and Jamba Juice I'm at fairly regularly and in a mad dash for dinner one night got take out there.  Is it authentic?  Not really, its got a mashup of Chinese-American items where most of the proteins are covered in batter and fried.  It has some Thai dishes.  The owner is Chinese from Hong Kong.  I'm hoping that if I go back a few times and order in Chinese, the dishes might come out a little less MSG filled.  An order of ten crab rangoons, and two dinner combos came out to $20 bucks.  Not bad for a last minute desparation dinner.  I'd really like more vegetables with my entrees, but the to go container was packed full of food.  The fried rice is standard soy-sauce colored rice with bits of egg.  The sauces were not too sweet (although shockingly red with food coloring).  Let me know if anyone has any luck finding an okay Chinese restaurant in S. Scottsdale.  I'm getting sick of Totties and am not a fan of the Tottie's service/price."}
{"text":"Loved our food....especially the chicken egg foo young!  Haven't had good egg foo young in years.  We had delivery and everything was great and hot. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Lives up to its name. It's how I've always hoped my my Chinese food will arrive... really freakin' delicious."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am a vegetarian.   Five stars for their tofu dishes   I have been looking for Yummy Yummy for about 8 years since my favorite Asian place in Flagstaff closed.   Vegi Food: I have had two dishes here so far and both were excellent. I ordered the Mongolian Beef (no beef sub tofu) and Sesame chicken (no chicki sub tofu). What makes this place stand out above 99% percent of Asian restaurants is that they lightly bread their tofu and fry it. The bread coating is an absolute must have to enhance the tofu. I can stomach plain cold tofu right out of the container but if you give it to me breaded and fried, then I am ecstatic. One note, if you get a tofu dish, I recommend dining in because the breading usually gets moist and soft if not eaten immediately. The vegetables are also very fresh here and not overcooked, I would almost describe my broccoli in the sesame tofu as raw or lightly steamed.  Ambiance: Nice or Normal, not much to expect from a strip mall restaurant.   My brother and cousin both had meat dishes, General Tso's chicken and Happy Family. They both enjoyed their meat dishes.   I highly recommend the vegetarian dining here and its the best quick Asian I have found in the Scottsdale & Thomas area."}
{"text":"The foods great and reasonably priced. We order egg rolls, hot and sour soup and King Poi Chicken.   The egg roll was pretty greasy, but the soup was great as was the Kung Poi.  A great place for take out."}
{"text":"This used be be one of my absolute favorites places to order Cromwell. My daughter and I have been ordering for a few years now for both lunch and dinner. They messed up an order for the first time the other night. No big deal, called and they fixed it. So today I was bragging to a coworker about their amazing food. We ordered lunch and talk embarrassing!! They changed the way the lunch comes (meat and veggies used to come in a small plastic bowl and the rice in the little take out box. Now it's all in a small bowl with literally a scoop of meat and veggies in a bowl full of rice.). When I called to ask about it the lady said she \"I don't know anything, I just work here. There is no manager. Oh he'll be here tomorrow, no we are closed tomorrow\". And now you have to ask for utensils as well. Which the lunch specials come with soup, so when you ask for utensils you think you would get a spoon as well. It's sad you cannot get employees who understand customer service."}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy Asian Food is now sitting in my tummy tummy.  I thought for sure I'd get the FTR on this one, but Adam and Norman beat me to the punch... I'm always excited to see new restaurants open up in my hood, especially ethnic restaurants.  So after dinner at Noodles Ranch last week, I picked up a menu from this place.  And when my hunger struck this evening, I decided to call in and place an order for take out.  Good thing I decided to take out instead of eat in, because this restaurant has no ambiance at all.  It was empty on a Saturday night and reminded me of the fast food Chinese places you see at food courts in malls.  The people working there were not very welcoming either... and when I suggested they add an eggplant dish to the menu, they basically just said 'no' without even entertaining the idea.  When I came home with my bag, I noticed that they didn't include chopsticks, utensils, napkins, soy sauce or fortune cookies.  What Chinese restaurant have you ever been to that didn't have fortune cookies?    Anyways, I ordered the Mu Shu Vegetable and the Mixed Vegetable with Shrimp in the \"Health Food Section\" of the menu.  I probably would not describe either dish as \"yummy yummy,\" but they were satisfactory. The portions were large and the vegetables were fresh, but the garlic sauce that came with the shrimp dish was pretty nasty.    I would possibly give this place another chance in the future for take-out in a pinch, but I'd highly recommend hitting up Noodles Ranch, Tottie's, or Lao Thai if you're wanting yummy yummy Asian food instead."}
{"text":"As close to New York Chinese takeout as you'll find in Old Town. Nice people, good food!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food here..been coming here for a few years now.....havnt complained yet lol"}
{"text":"The worst customer service I've ever experienced in a restaurant. We'll never order from here again. I'm just thankful that we never got food poisoning like some of the other people that have written reviews."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food, especially for the price. Its not like other chinese restaurants. I've always done pick up and the orders are always right... And they're quick!"}
{"text":"We ordered our food online, and when it didn't show up after a bout 40 minutes we called to check on the order. They said they never received it, and we placed the order over the phone. They quoted 20 to 30 minutes, and it's been and hour and we still haven't received our food. We just called them and they said it was on the way and would be a few more minutes. This is ridiculous. I don't recommend you ever order delivery from them."}
{"text":"I've ordered a variety of things here since my last review-all much better than the pad Thai! They have really great healthy options. The delivery is so fast to boot!"}
{"text":"My partner and I have came here a few times for food as it's the closest to where we live. The first time we came the young lady behind the register was rather unpleasant, however I understand that that day may not have been her best.  Do not come here. Today, to put it best, they'll ignore certain patrons, however they'll be quick to respond to others. We've waited at their register for a few minutes without being acknowledged by the three people near us. It almost seemed like we were inconveniencing them, yet another young lady comes in and they greet her immediately. I don't want to say it's based on any prejudice, but that they're food is not that great and their service is deplorable. Don't even think about ordering take out. Their delivery driver will condemn you if the tips isn't enough for his liking."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places that has 3 stars that I don't think deserves it. Have only ordered delivery but food is always fast and clean/flavorful.   My go to is the Mongolian beef but I have heard no complaints from any of my friends on the dumplings, general tso's, Kung pow and I'm sure other stuff too.   Give it a try. One of the better Chinese restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp and broccolli and added beef and cashew nuts. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my first time and will be the last time here. The restaurant was so dirty, and poor service. They serve everything in a paper plate. I order a beef and broccoli, and the broccoli was full of oil."}
{"text":"Singapore mai fun and pork egg rolls after a long day of work...too tired to cook for myself and so excited to her that door bell. Very happy for my dinner."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp & broccoli with fried rice and a order of general tso's chicken.  Serving size was pretty good, and they come in the perfect container to sneak into the movies theaters. Shhhhhh. don't tell anyone. Recommend if you're looking for good eats on a budget."}
{"text":"Ordering from Yummy Yummy was a waste of money.  First of all everything smelled and tasted like fish, although there was no fish in our order. My bet is that the oil they fried our chicken and wonton was not the best quality and probably been used thousand times before. Trying their egg drop soup was an exciting experience. Eating a jelly that tastes like chicken, well that's something everyone should try once. But only once. Be warned folks."}
{"text":"8-30-17 Ordered delivery, food was hot, good, seasoned. Highly recommended, stingy on the shrimp in fried rice but good!!"}
{"text":"I love ordering delivery from here. Honestly hands down the best Chinese food between Tempe and Scottsdale. It has been our go to whenever we don't feel like cooking or going out. Which is probably once a week. Their pan fried pork dumplings are bomb! Sesame chicken is super good and noodles and ma po tofu! My boyfriend is white and he loves it! Which makes my heart feel warm. It doesn't take close to an hour to get your food but doesn't that mean they are probably cooking from scratch? Not frozen? That's a good thing!"}
{"text":"Okay it's not anything fancy but a family owned take out Chinese. However I love how fast their pickup and delivery is!    And flavor is strong. I eat their Kung pao chicken and ma po tofu every week :)  Hot and sour soup is good too. But I especially love their mapo tofu, no meat , very simple but love the flavor :)   They lose one star as take out Chinese food because sometimes their flavor is not consistent and they always don't put fork when I do delivery but other wise my Togo takeout !"}
{"text":"I'm gunna throw out a 5 star for these guys. Their delivery is in point. They make it every time in under 30 minutes and the good is still smokin hot. Into it.  I generally stick with the same thing. Potstickers, orange chicken, crab Rangoon and chicken friend rice. All solid choices and never let you down."}
{"text":"Not good.  Don't understand why they are open and Lo Lo's closed.  The food tastes terrible.  Meat was rough.  I had orange chicken.  Would never go back"}
{"text":"I cannot believe the horrible customer service of this place. They are so rude, they will argue with you even if they are wrong and you have proof of it. I ordered on the phone, I asked them if they can repeat the order, they repeated the order back to me and it was good. Then when they brought me the food it was something completely different. I told them that, that was not what I order and the guy responded that's what you ordered, and that he was only the driver and couldn't do anything about. We called the restaurant the she basically told us to not order from them again. All because they didn't deliver the right food to us. I have never seen customer service so poor!!! I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone! Customer service is so important."}
{"text":"If you want to pay $11 for a small plate of pork fried rice and sit on the toilet for the next 3 days then I highly recommend this place.   ONE OF MY BIGGEST PET PEEVES IS they drop their brochures off at my apartment door every other week!!!!!!! PEOPLE JUST THROW THEM ON THE GROUND SO IT JUST CREATES UNNECESSARY TRASH ALL OVER THE COMPLEX!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delivery took a long time, food came hot, but 3 out of my 3 items tasted like shi* . Crab puffs have no flavor or crab, they were obviously frozen and not fresh. I got the Triple Delight and requested a sauce that they didn't put on or the sauce is just really bad. The beef and chicken both tasted like rubber which made me lose my complete appetite. The food is beyond greasy.  The egg drop soup was the only decent thing and it's not even great. This place was a waste of my precious calories and my Benjamin's! I'll stick with my China Jade, which would smoke this restaurant if they went up next to each other"}
{"text":"Looks are deceiving. This place had great customer service, the food was awesome and the taste was fresh and very good. If your looking for good Chinese food in Scottsdale, and are not worried about looks, then this is the place to grab your chow (mein).. Make your way there..."}
{"text":"very average food  didnt see cooks wearing  gloves, the girl that takes orders is very business like and unfriendly Thank you is not in her vocabulary. Nothing at all special here nothing like NYC or LA asian food"}
{"text":"Ok. This is my FIRST time using yelp!!! That's how HORRIBLE this place is. Also, my first & definitely my last visit here as well. I ordered the chicken lo mein for lunch, there was about 2oz of chicken, and 1oz of it was just gross fat, I almost puked when I started chewing, and quickly spit it out.... absolutely disgusting!  I ask the guy, where is the chicken? It's pretty much cabbage & noodles, and the entire entree was tasteless,  he said because I ordered lunch & there are different levels of entreees? Huh????? I wasn't expecting a pound of chicken, but literally 5 tiny pieces and a big chunk of fat! Yukkk.......the place had abs no air..it's az it's 100 degrees...dusty dirty fan was overhead, counters not tidy? Just all around gross! Save yourself the money.....and go to panda express across the street, I did.....so, I baught myself 2 lunches. 1 to throw away 2nd one to enjoy! Oh and they forced me to give a star?  It's actually a zero star, if throw in the rude service"}
{"text":"This place fell off my radar for awhile, but I recently went back and it was just as consistent as I remember.   I always get takeout from here. Honestly, the inside isn't all that clean and since I genuinely like the food from here I figure let's keep things positive :) In the past I would order dinner items with my family, but then I started switching to the lunch specials, which are a pretty good deal (especially considering how much food you get).   There's probably about 30-40 items to choose from (meat, veggie, noodle, fish, etc...). For the most part it's pretty usual stuff (orange chicken, lo mein, broccoli beef, etc...). I normally get a chicken (orange or honey) or bbq spare ribs (no bone). It's all a little greasy, but good. You get a choice of white, brown, or fried rice. The brown rice is good, and it's usually what I get. The main course and rice are served together in a round plastic carry-out bowl (that's pretty big). Then you get a choice of wonton soup, egg drop soup, egg roll, or soda. I normally get an egg roll. It's pretty greasy, but huge. I've had both the soups as well, and although they taste good, they're pretty broth heavy.   Prices are VERY reasonable for what you get. Depending on your main item meals are $6.49 or $6.99. They're pretty quick with orders and from what I can tell food is made as you order so it's fairly fresh."}
{"text":"This food was not that good it was very over cooked in it taste bland. The meat was just charged and burnt."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy is probably our go-to Chinese food. We love the food, our favorite dishes so far have to be the wonton soup, chicken low mien, egg fu young(any kind), orange chicken and the egg drop soup. It's close to our home which is nice, they also deliver but you can call in and pick up as well. If your looking for decent Chinese food, go here, they don't disappoint."}
{"text":"OMG, so good and flavorful and reasonably priced. Great Chinese food (especially their fried dishes). My favorites are: fried shrimp eggroll (can order by the each and they are huge), fried chicken wings (perfectly crispy- 8 in an order), and beef eggplant with white rice (tender meat and very saucy). I recommend ordering delivery through Eat24; the restaurant has quick service and food arrives piping hot."}
{"text":"Very good for inexpensive take-out! Got delivery from here one afternoon for dinner and I could not believe how fast it came.(Less than half an hour) Ordered the crab puffs/rangoons, pad thai, coconut chicken, and orange beef with white rice. Everything came hot, fresh and delicious.   The crab puffs were crispy with a good amount of filling and great flavor (goes great with sweet and sour sauce); the pad thai tasted good but lacked a little in the complexity of flavor that I'm used to with that particular dish but the textures were spot on. I absolutely loved the sauces on the chicken and beef, although the orange sauce could stand to have a bit of spice. The batter on both dishes wasn't soggy and was still light and fluffy.   As to the meat vs batter ratio I've been seeing some of the reviews complain about, I didn't see what they were talking about, the amount of meat compared to the batter was about average for that sort of batter. As for the portion sizes, they're larger than what I'm used to when getting take-out Chinese (Think 2-3 portions from Panda Express per single entree plate) so the price is pretty spot on considering what you're getting. Giving this 4/5 because I loved just about everything about it (almost comparable to China town take-out)"}
{"text":"I will admit that I was a little iffy on going to a place called Yummy Yummy But I always like to try new places and looking for Chinese in Phoenix has been pretty hard lately.. Most places have been just \"OK\" Yummy Yummy is located in the shopping plaza on the south east corner of Thomas and Sdale road... There are so many eating options here as so many new food chains are opening up...  We decided to get Take Out from Yummy Yummy due to a busy evening  Upon walking in, the inside actually isn't bad... very basic layout, nothing flashy... The employees were all very friendly They have a pretty big menu but I had noticed that they had an Orange Chicken special which came with rice and a egg roll for about $6 so I chose that I also got a Dr pepper can Came out to a decent price The food took about 15 minutes to get ready which was pretty quick  They were nice enough to double bag it and toss in some soy sauce, hot sauce, and napkins... Oh and fortune cookies...  Getting home, I was sort of hoping to see the cool little red/white boxes that Chinese food usually comes in but they were in a cool black plastic container It smelt really good and I was looking forward to the taste Pretty good The brown rice is good The orange chicken is very flavorful and cooked well The eggroll was a little dry but the sauces came in handy  All in all I was pretty impressed and happy to have had a good Chinese food experience at Yummy Yummy I will recommend it to any one looking for affordable take out Not as bad as some reviews make it seem   :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place for good bad chinese-- you know what I mean, greasy and not at all good for you-- then this is a good place!  My boyfriend and I have lived in Old Town for 2 years and had yet to find a decent delivery chinese place.  I'd actually ordered from Yummy Yummy over a year ago and was not impressed.  But, either it's hit or miss, or their \"new management\" actually has improved things.  I tend to order a lot of fried, filled foods when I order chinese, and this place did it right!  I had crab rangoon, pork filled wontons, and an eggroll, and all were fantastic!  The eggroll was gigantic and very crisp, and the rangoon and wontons were crisp with a good amount of filling.  Usually when I order these things, the rangoon is soft and mushy, and the wontons are mostly breading.  So, I was excited that this was not the case.    My sesame chicken tasted like every other order of sesame chicken I've ever had.  I was not a fan of the fried rice that accompanied it.  It tasted kind of like I would expect feet to taste.  My boyfriend had chicken chow mein and orange chicken with the sauce on the side, and he was a fan of both.  Service was accurate and prompt, although, I asked for \"lots\" of sweet and sour sauce, and they gave me one small container of it, no more than they normally give.  In conclusion, will I go here when I want a gourmet dinner?  No.  But, will I crave this when I'm hungover and don't want to leave my apartment on a Sunday evening?  Absolutely!  I am happy to have an alternative to pizza when I want delivery food."}
{"text":"Not one of my best Chinese meals ever.  I ordered the shrimp with mixed vegetables, which was okay but nothing to rave about.  I make better Brown rice myself, the shrimp was decent but there were only 4 or 5 shrimp, the mixed vegetables were varied and good. The egg drop soup was screaming hot but not very good. I left with barely enough to eat, and I'm a skinny guy.  For $3 or $4 more next time, I'll find a restaurant with tastier and more generous portions. My vote: never to return."}
{"text":"Basic chinese food, you're getting exactly what you pay for duh. Close to my home, quick run, lots of food for the price!"}
{"text":"Disappointing, below average food with dated interior and less than friendly service. Ordered General Tso chicken. Crappy breaded flavor and sauce pile of bland brown rice and greasy egg roll. The only decent flavor was the siracha on the table. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was sorely disappointed. Looking at the photos of the food, I was led to believe that the food would be, at the very least, presentable. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken, and it looked like canned chicken mixed with a bottled sauce thrown on a styrofoam plate. The lunch order did not come with a drink, and the service was poor. It was a decision between here and LoLo's down the path. Wrong decision indeed. I don't see myself coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Only booths, no regular tables, more like a take out place.  Might try takeout sometime, but with so many local restaurants needing to stay open, I prefer ones that know how to do it all really well."}
{"text":"Dissatisfied ordered General Tao - it was orange chicken with 3 pieces of broccoli.  The hot and sour soup looked right but did NOT taste right at all!"}
{"text":"Got delivery for this place. I would recommend the mapo tofu (medium). It was pretty good and the portions were huge! The General Tso's chicken was okay, and not so good the next day."}
{"text":"I think the health department needs to come inspect Yummy Yummy food & kitchen!  I went & got carry out Yummy Yummy yesterday......GROSS!! Paid approx. $7.00 for orange chicken with fried rice & egg roll.  The rice had a nasty taste & did not look YUMMY.  Threw it in trash.  Saved the egg roll for a yummy breakfast OMG!  Took one bite NASTY TASTE.  Pulled it open to look at ingrediants & about threw up! Inside looked like very old brownish colored cabbage & it looked like OLD FOOD OUT OF A GARBAGE CAN!! TRASHED!!! YUMMY YUMMY IS NOT YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"Let me paint you a picture. It's getting kind of late. You have a choice, you could go to the gym, make a healthy meal, shower, and feel pretty good about yourself... or you could throw on some baggy clothes, boot up netflix, and order Yummy Yummy. I chose the latter. I choose the latter quite a bit. I am simultaneously amazed at the combination of both the ever so slightly better than mediocre chinese that I am given and the superhuman-like ability of the delivery man to macgyver his way into whatever passcode protected apartment complex I choose to have him deliver to. Likewise I am grateful for his speedy judgement-free exit once the necessary I take food, you take money exchange is complete... Though they always give me silverware for two...   Overall I find each Yummy Yummy experience one that satisfies my needs for fast, unhealthy american-style chinese that is brought to me no matter the obstacle."}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice now. We've had fried rice, crab puffs, coconut shrimp, boneless spare ribs, and orange chicken. Both times my order was delivered well in advance of the promised one hour.  It actually only took about 20 minutes.   The food is great for what it is. It's not A+ quality like a great sit-down Chinese restaurant, but I don't expect that in delivery received in 20 minutes. The spare ribs were great, with just the right amount of fat and no grizzle. The orange chicken was over-breaded but still good, and it came with some fresh, crisp broccoli. The coconut shrimp comes with a really interesting creamy sauce that's a nice change from sweet and sour. I also loved the fried rice with the unusual addition of bean sprouts.   I will mention though, that the first time I ordered, the man who came to give me my delivery, which I had paid for by credit card using the Yelp app, told me \"you pay tip in cash.\" While it goes without saying that I was going to tip him, it bothered me to be told that I have to, and it was worse that he demanded cash. It didn't stop me from ordering from them again though!"}
{"text":"GARBAGE. 75% of our delivery meal went into the trash. Have you ever ordered sweet & sour from this place? I was so confused, I had to CALL the restaurant to ask them what the battered cat turd shaped items were in my to go dish. No peppers? Onions? Pineapple? Dry hush puppy looking things next to rice with a big styrofoam dish of sweet & sour sauce on the side. WTF? Don't they know that S & S is an American Chinese dish and requires particular ingredients? For the record, I was simply told: \"this how we serve this\". And the Chicken teriyaki? God awful chunks of gristly dark meat, some with skin, swimming in a watered down sauce of some sort? Thank God the egg rolls were edible, as I had not eaten all day. And NOT cheap. Crab Rangoon? How do you screw this up, well, I'll tell you. You put 1/8th of a teaspoon of cream cheese in a wonton wrapper and fold it into one large triangle and soak it in grease. What ever happened to those cute little twisted bird's nest looking things that actually had filling you could taste. Yep, in the trash they went. Never, ever, ever again. I'd rather starve or eat snails From my garden. Yummy? Get out the dictionary you nits!"}
{"text":"I've ordered pick up and I've also ordered delivery. This place is a hit or miss. I've had a dish with garlic sauce and it was good. The sesame chicken is also good.   I also tried the Szechuan dumplings... they were NOT good. They had a thick wrapper and were doused in basically sweet and sour sauce with spice mixed in."}
{"text":"I have not visited this actual location, I've only used them for delivery via the grubhub app. Their delivery food is mediocre at best - they brought me no chopsticks, the house fried rice has so many ingredients you can't taste any of them. The wontons were cold and bland tasting. I'm guessing their food is much better eaten in-house. They did however provide me with four fortune cookies, which now have me wondering what my future really holds.  I think this is located next to Noodle Ranch which gets glowing reviews for ultra fresh asian food."}
{"text":"I've ordered from them twice and have enjoyed it both times. The food was hot and tasted great. Supplied with plenty of soy sauce and utensils. Arrived in less time than the app suggested. Would order again."}
{"text":"For reasonably priced American-style Chinese takeout available later at night than most other Chinese restaurants in the area, this hit the spot. The portions were large, and everything we ordered was quite decent (Lo Mein, Mongolian Beef, Orange Chicken). I'm no expert on the Phoenix/Scottsdale dining scene, as I don't live in Arizona, but I assume one can find better Chinese food in the area, at least during normal dining hours. But as far as run-of-the-mill Chinese takeout goes, this is decidedly above average."}
{"text":"Finally a decent egg foo young. Price and flavor were good. I've tried other Chinese restaurants in this area and this one is the best one."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few times and I find it to be good!  I usually don't have any issues with delivery.   I have tried the orange chicken, which I found to be great!  The lo mein is a little greesy, but still tasty."}
{"text":"This place is my guilty pleasure. I find myself ordering at least once a week. House Lo Mein (no vegetables), house soup (or hot and sour) and a couple egg rolls. The delivery guy knows my house and my dogs. The ordering, paying, and tipping online makes it super easy. They are super busy most of the time (cause it's really good), so be patient... Or do what I do and order before you get home. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!I have been looking for delicious Chinese around this area for a while,and this certainly is it!!My husband had the house fried rice,and I had the shrimp lo mein,both were out of this world.The guy working the register was super nice and helpful,we are most certainly coming back!!"}
{"text":"I would change the name of this place to filthy and grossy. its a tiny storefront, dirty floors, boxes of food produces behind the counter and thru the bqack of the kitchen, it looked so dirty, that i didnt order a meal, i figured id be safe just ordering some won ton soup, i was wrong, the brother was pale and tasteless. i have no idea what type of meat was inside the wonton itself, but it sure wasnt chicken, beef, or pork, it was sweet and stringy, and i spit out the 1st bite, , if i could post 0 stars i would"}
{"text":"Yuk no taste orange chicken ,fried rice not waste money there,never again,waited for order place is dirty,paid 16 dollars for 2 small orders"}
{"text":"We are full, happy and need a nap! I ordered online, it came piping hot and exactly what we wanted. I got shrimp in lobster sauce, biggest shrimp I have seen and perfectly cooked, brown rice was done correctly, the flavors were wonderful!   Hubby got general tsos chicken, he was very satisfied,  heat was just right and the pork fried rice was very tasty."}
{"text":"Unfortunately me and my girlfriend tried this place tonight for the first time and absolutely regret it. All of our food quickly went into the trash and became a quick sad waste of $35!   We didn't order much and it was still expensive but I figured it'll be hefty portions? Nope. I got the chicken fried rice, two orders of crab rangoon's (labeled as puffs), a can of soda, white steamed chicken with white rice and sweet and sour sauce. My girlfriends steamed chicken came with no rice and it was a pretty small bowl of chicken. All of that was disappointing considering it was $10 alone!! She took one bite of it and spit it out saying it was disgusting and slimey. It quickly went in the trash. My chicken fried rice was unlike ANY I've had. There were a ton of vegetables in there that were not expected or wanted. I've never had any fried rice that had these. It was like lo mein with rice. I TRIED picking around them but it was impossible. It seemed it would be good without them but I'll never try again to see. The crab rangoon's were not warm at all nor crispy. Not one item of our food was pleasant! NOTHING!  I have been desperate for some yummy Chinese since I moved to Arizona and Yummy Yummy Chinese definitely doesn't live up to its name!!! The only thing I kept were the rangoon's but I'm pretty sure those will get tossed eventually from being uneaten. We were wanting to try and venture out and it was a regret! Please take the bad reviews on here to heart. I tried to assume it was a this or that situation but clearly wasn't. They're just bad! I think those who like it have bad taste and like cold food. Go to China Wok down the street. It's still expensive but you get more food that is better than this and it'll be fresh and warm!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order Chinese food the other night from them, it was waste of money. We order worth of 30 order. We ended up throw them away. No a healthy Chinese. Too much oil in everything."}
{"text":"Food is good and usually fast. The delivery guys have asked me twice to come downstairs...uh no. If I wanted to come downstairs, I would have just came and picked it. Anyway,no harm...I'll continue to order from here."}
{"text":"I don't think this place gets good credit. Ordered last night it was good. Sesame chicken was great, delish!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with some coworkers.  I got the sesame chicken which was decent.  I also got the crab Rangoon, it was a little short on the cheese and crab on the inside.  The big problem we had was with the soda machine.  It did not have any co2 in it and the coke was out of syrup and the would not let us just grab a can from the fridge instead.  Pretty disappointing trip.  The sink in the men's washroom was also disgusting.  The place was unorganized, a few booths looked like a make shift supply closet."}
{"text":"Quite awful. Greasy. Beef and broccoli was 80% broccoli and the pieces were HUGE so they took up most of the room in the bowl. Hardly any sauce at all. Ordered egg fried rice by #, got home and some nasty looking fried rice with cubed meat, jumbo shrimp and huge raw onion chunks were in it's place. Crab puffs were all dough - maybe 1/4 teaspoon filling. I really have nothing positive to say about the place. Not cheap, either for what you get. Tried it once and I will never be back."}
{"text":"The food here was good, I got exactly what I ordered.  The Egg Rolls were probably the best I've ever had.    This just isn't a place you want to eat at.  It's ok to order to go or have it delivered.  There were boxes everywhere and they literally boxed me in while I was in the restroom.    Having said that the food was quite good.  I will definitely go back but it will be a to go order."}
{"text":"I don't generally leave reviews but I felt I really needed to in this instance. My family has done takeout twice now (in one week) and they were extremely quick and the food is amazing. Seriously the best Chinese I have found in the area and I've lived in this area for almost a decade! I love the fact that they don't drench the sweet and sour chicken and keep the sauce separate, the chicken was super crunchy and not soggy. Egg rolls are huge and super delicious.  I don't know why anyone would leave a bad review, the staff are friendly and the food is flavorful and so yummy!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the food from this restaurant but the service is not acceptable!! They are rude on the phone and have forgotten portions of our order numerous times and then deliver missing items 40 minutes later. We are 5 minutes from their location. I don't think I will be giving my business and money to a restaurant who has such horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"I was really happy after ordering delivery the first time. However, when I ordered take-out recently, the quality dropped tremendously. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Don't really know where to begin.  I really don't know how in the world this place passes health inspection.  It is filthy...sadly there are no other words. It is open to the public to see where the food is prepared so one would think it would be clean .... It is NOT. I am not sure if there is new ownership that is absolutely no excuse. The food at one time was decent but the truth be told I always had it delivered so I was not aware of the cleanliness of the place or lack there of. I started picking it up and was disgusted thinking ...  AM I CRAZY?  This is ptomaine poisoning waiting to happen. Filthy Filthy Filthy ."}
{"text":"Poor Yummy Yummy...why do they get such bad reviews?  Firstly, I don't eat meat very often (sorta Vegetarian) so maybe people have had some poor dishes based on that. Secondly, I haven't stepped foot into the restaurant once (in my experience strip mall Chinese places aren't always the nicest looking on the inside)...  Those two things aside, I get take out from them often. The quality is good, they're super prompt, and the food is always hot.  So for what it is, it's convenient and decent.   I like that they'll sub anything --- If you want make it a Tofu dish, or Shrimp.  I usually get the Tom Yam Soup with Shrimp - Very good Orange Shrimp (I just ask them to make it) - Good Shrimp with Broccoli - Good.  I don't know about anything else...because it might be risky!  FYI - When ordering some of you complain about an accent on the phone. Use your brain, if you say \"Number 12 please...\" and she replies in a thick accent  \"wahtah ehg drahp\" She's probably relaying your order \"wonton egg drop\". Use your head. It's not complicated...and you're just being tactless."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese delivery!! I love their food and their delivery team is fast, zero complaints!"}
{"text":"Wanted Chinese food and didn't want to drive too far.  Remembered the menu we received in the mail and gave Yummy Yummy a try.  Almost didn't after some of the YELP reviews, but glad we ignored most of you.  Having lived in SE Asia, I tend to be quite picky and I found the sampling of food we had to be tasty, well cooked and very generous in the serving size.  We over ordered and now have plenty of food to enjoy tomorrow. We chose to dine in and we were not unhappy.  I found the owners to be accomodating and friendly, but then I was friendly as well and asking questions that they were only too happy to answer.  We will definitely go back and are thrilled to have good Chinese food so close to home."}
{"text":"Intially I was skeptical because it was geared towards takeout, but we sat down to eat in and the service and food were fantastic...  I had the kung pao beef and it was very flavorful and the portions were huge.  I was stuffed when I left."}
{"text":"Did take out from here as my fridge was empty and I was about to catch a flight to, ironically, China on a business trip.  Obviously, as a frequent traveler to Asia I have quite an inderstanding of how Chinese food differs from American-Chinese food... but sometime you just want some comfort food in the form of sugary, deep fried chicken and rice!  Sadly, the food at Yummy Yummy was the toal opposite of its name.  What I received was bland, and somewhat generic tasting.... almost like they prepared things ahead of time, and then added some additional seasonings to try to match the order (in this case, orange flavor).  I've yet to find a good Chinese place in Phoenix, and this place certainly is on my list of bad ones."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place that delivers in good portions you'll want to try Yummy Yummy. It's fairly good food for the price they offer"}
