{"text":"My friend brought me over for lunch.  This is not your regular lunch joint with lunch specials for $6.99.  This is a nicely decorated restaurant with proper table settings.  We got there 12ish and left at 1:30.  We were the only table there.

The two of us ordered way too much food but all of them are delicious.  The chef really put his heart into making the food.  The menu is quite creative so it's the best to ask the owner what to eat.  We had a dish that we stuff several ingredients into a pastry, that is truly impressive.  The other one is dumplings with \"chicken soft bone\" is very tasty.  We also have an off the menu beef noodle soup which is better than most places.

The menu is full of big bright pictures with creative names of each dish.  Some pages even have a Chinese poems to go with it.  The pic of the Peking duck looks really good and this is what we set out to do next time with a bigger crew."}
{"text":"Classic brisket noodles were good and spicy. I got the mild spice and it had a very good kick. Probably best dish of my meal.

The beef buns were tasted good but nothing special. The bun part was a little thick and doughy tho. 

Pan fried dumplings were actually a little bland in comparison to the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"Great food, presentation, and service. Good price. Good environment. I come regularly, like one per week. Sadly this place is at a wrong location, and the middle aged Cantonese demographic are too afraid or wary of trying something new. Give it a go, you won't regret it. Pointers to those afraid of spicy, ask for mild spiciness. ?Xiao la ???"}
{"text":"+.5 for service and surprise dish

Let me start off by saying WHAT A MENU! And the capitalization doesn't come from its variety, but rather from its design and translation, double the \"wow\" factor.

If you've been to China recently and visited decent or above average restaurants, this place gives you that feeling in a very similar sense. Why? The decor is supposedly artful; the dishes are extra special in terms of shapes and materials; and did I mention THE MENU! It's extra glossy, extra large pictures, extra fine quality printing, and extra heavy! It makes the ordering process that much more addictive...

You'll see from my photos, we ordered three dishes: 1. Dragon fruit & beef strips 2. Eggplant stuffed with shrimp 3. Deep fried sweet potato with sugar pulls (not the most accurate names sry).

Plus the boss was super nice and chatted with us for a bit, and even gave us an extra dish of appetizer with peanuts and spicy beef slices and beef tripe, except he didn't know my brother was allergic to peanuts, haha, the gesture was greatly appreciated though. 

What disappointed was the actual food quality. What makes that much more of an important return-or-not factor than how nice the boss or the decor or THE MENU was. 

The beef strips tasted treated with dragon fruit, interesting mix, except the sauce was pretty much darkened sweet and sour sauce, and the beef was sooooo chewy.

The eggplant and shrimp looked delicious in the picture, but came up with a completely different look, and ended up being deep fried (un-defrosted) eggplant chunks stuff with one small shrimp in between. Again...with sweet and sour sauce.

The sugar on the deep fried sweet potato was supposed to be crunchy after you dip the whole thing in water, except it was super sticky.

Our meal was $45 (pre-tip) with 3 bowls of rice.

On a separate occasion when we packed a pot of source preserved vegetables and fish fillets, that wasn't too bad, and if I ever go back I'll try that again.

{"text":"Randomly picked this restaurant to try as my relative had tried it before. When we first walked in, it was pretty empty but the décor was so elegant with layers of table cloth and chair covers and nice dinning sets ... we were worried that it is going to be an expensive meal. The menu was huge with pictures to all their dishes. Since this restaurant food was mainly catered to China crowd, lots of the menu items we were unsure of what it was and that lots are spicy dishes. Their English translation was weird compared to the Chinese name but luckily they had pictures.

We wanted to try the spinach balls but after we ordered it and then 5 minutes later, they come back and said they are all out. Really? I was looking forward to trying it. The 2 tables next to us had it, it was Saturday and it was only 7pm .. start of dinner time yet they are already out? That make no sense.

We ended up trying these instead ..  flaming shrimp, watercress salad, pan fry siu lung bao and tomato scramble eggs. The dishes were pretty good, not oily, and very unique plating presentation of the dishes. Not like any typical Chinese restaurant.  The prices are reasonable, of course not like the prix-fix set-course meal prices.  Will want to try other dishes from here again. And they have a different lunch menu as well, totally different from the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Good presentaiton & amazing food. Peking duck is tasty, highly recommended. Parking is a challenge in this mall, be aware!"}
{"text":"First time here and first impression when I walked in its very nice. Very roomy and not that busy on Sunday evening. The food is impressive as well as the plate. Very unique! The food is very good specially the sour fish soup. This is northern Chinese style. Consider a 4 star including their service."}
{"text":"A friend recommended we go there for lunch. When we walked in, no one was at the restaurant.. therefore, was wondering whether we should have backed out but since I saw the pictures and reviews, I thought I should give this a try. 

All the dishes were quite decently priced and the food quality and taste were surprisingly good~  the stir fried lamb celery rice (though doesn't looked like the picture on the menu) and also the beef noodle soup.. yummy. 

The only thing I didn't like was the dumpling soup.

Would definitely go back for dinner. 

Such a pity this beautiful restaurant wasn't as busy as it should be..  definitely shouldn't judge its book by its over and go try this restaurant. Guaranteed you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I like to try newly opened restaurant and here I was today.  Wouldn't have a clue of what kind of food it served just by its name.  Pushed open the glass door and then another wooden door, to our surprise, it is a fancy restaurant with nice décor.  This is a Shanghai fusion restaurant.  The menu is with a hardcover, heavy and every dish comes with a picture.  I was amazed by the food coz they came out either exactly as the pic or even in better presentation.  We had spicy chicken, spinach balls with sesame sauce, fried rice and dumplings with diced chicken.  They all tasted good!  Could tell the food were prepared by a chef with a \"heart\"!! 
Most of the food come in two prices; one regular and one VIP.  Ranging from a dollar to three dollars difference.  They are now offering everyone with VIP price until their VIP cards are ready.  I was given a temp VIP card when I left and it is good till end of May.  ** VIP is $20 for three years **
^^The only downside is there are limited choices of food.  Their menu is much smaller than the average Shanghai restaurants. ^^"}
{"text":"It is the second time that one of the orders were forgotten.  We reminded the waitress twice.  By the time the order was rushed out, the long beans were undercooked.  The elder people of the table had a hard time biting through them.  It gave a Mother's Day dinner an anti-climatic ending."}

This place has potential and is definitely a welcome addition to the already busy New Kennedy Square.

We came here on a weekend night after one of my other friends tried it and gave a positive review on it. The decorations in here were simply impressive, and I first thought this was going to be a restaurant where it would be $50 a head, but turns out the prices were very reasonable.

My first impression of the menu was, once again, simply high quality. Opened it, looked at the Chinese and English translations...what the?! It seemed like they used Google Translate or freetranslation.com for their English translations, cause they seemed rather...weird.

Enough with the menu, on to the food...we ordered hand-made beef balls, hand-made beef tripe, seafood fried udon, and spinach balls. The beef tripe and fried udon were done quite well, not a lot of oil but still tasted well. The beef balls tasted like charcoal...nothing like beef at all. The spinach balls came with peanut sauce put on top, and I found it nothing special.

Service was excellent, as the waitresses did explain thoroughly the items which we had questions about, and offered suggestions on what we can order. Again, I think this place has potential and I would come back for a second visit to try out other items (or lunch!)."}
{"text":"Just opened today at the Peachtree Plaza, this restaurant replaced the old Mong Kok. It has been given a full make over. It has an urban modern decor (hence the name), the menu looks like a magazine, and the dishes have a beautiful artistic presentation. The best part, the taste of the dishes. Every dish we tried was delicious, delicate tasting, no flavours are overpowering; subtle yet flavourful. The staff was very welcoming and treated us with a complimentary dish and some wine. Do not be intimidated by the decor, the prices are very reasonable. Pay close attention to the poetic names of the dishes, one of them was called \"Smell of tea listening to the sweet\" (certainly creative, good thing there are nice big pictures on the menu). Will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Luxurban Kitchen is promising. Love the colourful and interesting menu. I had fun just reading the Chinese VS English translation which were just badly done or lost in translation.

We ordered a few items to try out:

??? ($8.99) Mouth Water Chicken (As it is in the menu!)
???????($8.99) Mustard Clam Watercress
??????($8.99) Yellow Bean Sprouts Crystalline Powder (it is how it is in the menu?! Powder and Noodle is the same Chinese character but can means totally different)
????($12.99) The Fragrant Lotus Beef
???? (Complimentary Dessert) Yam with Blueberry

Love the presentation and they all looked picture perfect. But the taste is just a little off balanced in most of the dishes. Nothing really impressed me enough for a repeat visit.

I am glad that the menu comes with such colourful illustration of the dish as even I would feel so lost just reading the name of the dishes."}
{"text":"When I initially walked in, the entire restaurant was empty. The decor however, makes the restaurant seem very spacious and bright. As opposed to many Chinese restaurants, Luxurban manages to capture a clean, elegant, and minimalistic atmosphere. By noon, a bunch more families settled in.  

The service was moderately quick. The waitress did her job well, as she was able to multitask many tables by herself without mistakes. 

The menu itself is absolutely gorgeous. The resolution is high, and the food is plated in a very luxurious way. The English translations are a bit confusing so I would strongly suggest clarification for certain items. 

From what my family ordered, the watercress mustard clam salad, beef roll pancake, and hot and sour soup were standouts. I wouldn't try anything on the menu that required a lot of oil, since many dishes had exorbitant amounts. 

Overall, the highlight of Luxurban Kitchen was really the clean setting where we ate, coupled with a few select dishes, and face-paced service."}
