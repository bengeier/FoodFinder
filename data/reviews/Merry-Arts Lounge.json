{"text":"Normally love this place. Mistake of going on taco night.  We were going to have one beer and leave.  One bartender no servers.  Bartender made no effort to look around.  Finally caught her eye but she ignored us.  Shame.  Lost sale."}
{"text":"i go here once or twice a week. the place is decent, the food has gotten better over the last few months. its worth eating now. the bartenders are usually nice, except one. kelsea, she steals from the customers. i hate that cunt."}
{"text":"Good food, nice patio, but terrible service. 
I waited 2 hours for 2 tacos. Unreasonable. I hope to never be back."}
{"text":"I'm becoming a regular because of the consistently good food and service. Taco night is a trip. 2 bucks a throw! Wings are better than most. Flatbread pizza is great. TV in the booths are great for sports fans. This place has 2 bars which comes in handy during big games and taco night. Has a 'dive bar' feel upon entering , but that disappears quickly because of the great attitude of the staff."}
{"text":"Wednesday is BOGO burgers!! Soooooo good."}
{"text":"I used to live in Lakewood but now I live in another state, and when I come back to town I tend to rely on friends' recommendations about where to eat, given that there are like 100 pub/grill type places around there.  A buddy told me this place was good, so we stopped in for a weekday lunch with beer.  Unfortunately, the \"grill\" part of the restaurant name is misleading - this place only has food during certain restricted hours.  We arrived after 2 pm and found their kitchen was totally closed and they weren't even serving any sort of bar food (i.e. mozz sticks or anything nukable).  This was a bummer as they do have an extensive tasty-looking menu (in additional to dinner specials only available on certain nights of the week, like the aforementioned tacos) but we couldn't order any of it.  

The staff suggested we order pizza in the restaurant next door and bring it over to eat in the bar - no thanks!  If I'd wanted pizza I'd have just gone to a pizza joint in the first place.  Sadly, we had to leave without ordering anything as I hadn't had anything to eat all day and wanted a place that served lunch. 

This place might be OK for a quick beer but if you are planning to eat there, check first to make sure the \"grill\" is actually in operation before you stop in."}
{"text":"I usually don't enjoy bar food, but Merry Arts is a pleasant surprise.I started going to Merry Arts about 8 months ago, and nothing but good things from the staff to the food. 

The bar is split in two, with a main bar that has seating with tables. The other side is split of with a smaller bar that has booths ( TVs in booths) behind the bar for more seating. The patio is the best part in my opinion. It has tables and couches to hang out, with plenty of TVs both inside and out. It is a great place to catch a sporting event. I actually watched most of the NBA playoffs here and the atmosphere was great! 

The food is good ! My favorite items are the burgers and wings! I tried all the burgers with no complaint! The wings are juicy and crispy at the same time, very delicious. The tacos are good as well, especially good for the taco specials. They are prepared in a fried shell, which I always love. 
Recently had their new beef BBQ ranch pizza, and OMG it was perfectly prepared! I can not wait to go again! 

The staff is well seasoned and does a good job with a large crowd. Some nights they can be rude ( mostly from being overwhelmed) but overall a good experience. They have some very pretty girls working so they can get away with bad service at times. 

I would highly recommend Merry Arts for lunch, dinner, dates, and or sporting events. Always a good time !"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere in this bar.  The food is excellent and the bartenders are very attentive.  The flatbread pizza on their new menu is excellent!"}
{"text":"We went there the first time and it was busy, but we got the special where you buy one hamburger and you get the other one for free. It was very  good. We went back there and the service was horrible. You sit on the other side of the bar and you don't get any waitress and the employees see you waiting for 10-15 minutes, but nobody comes to the table.  We gave them another chance and the same thing happened. Poor management and its sad because it was one of our favorite places. We won't return there again."}
{"text":"Best bar in lakewood! This place has got a great crowed not too young and not too old. The food is great as well! You can't go wrong with cheap drinks and great food!"}
{"text":"This place is special amongst the divey-esque places in Lakewood. Decent atmosphere. Interior has 2 section, high top tables, plenty of televisions, pleasant clientele (usually), decent prices, good specials, jukebox, covered and uncovered patio, tacos (duh) Monday and Thursday, and live music on occasion. The only negative thing I can say is the service sometimes. I am not sure if it's my uncanny ability to be invisible at a bar but sometimes I'll stand and remain unserved for 5
minutes or more. It isn't as though the customer volume is overwhelming. 

This is really the only negative thing to coming here that I can think of. At least on a Monday ;] otherwise merry arts is a favorable experience and I will continue to patronize this establishment. 

Try the hot taco with sour cream and a bumble berry draft. If that can't cure a Monday I don't know what can."}
{"text":"I am a bit of a bar expert, and this is one of the very best spots in Cleveland!  Yes the tacos are awesome on Mondays and Thursdays, but the menu the rest of the week is awesome!  Some of the best wings I've had and the bogo burgers can't be beat.  If you like steak, you'll get the best 10 oz strip dinner for around $8 on Sundays!  Did I mention how cheap the prices are?  They have happy hour every day of the week and beer specials all the time--awesome craft beer selection.  I've been going more and more over the last couple of years mostly because of the staff and it's the perfect spot to catch a game--big screens everywhere!"}
{"text":"Merry Arts has been my favorite neighborhood bar for years. Patty's tacos are a MUST and I also love their 2-for-1 burgers on Wednesday nights. The beef is delicious and they have some great burger topping combos. They also have super cheap pitchers during all CLE sporting events.

They have a good beer selection and usually pretty fast service. Over the years I've had some servers who take forever but typically food and drinks come out pretty quickly. The new patio is really nice - but you do have to be more assertive about getting service out there.

Also - free popcorn...who doesn't love free popcorn? :)"}
{"text":"Merry Arts is great.  People complaining about the slow service are not taking advantage of both bars.  On weekends, it is often overcrowded on one side for no good reason.  The people there have always been good to me.  And they may serve bar food, but it's reasonably priced and much better than most bar food.  The tacos are great.

Decent place for beginner musicians looking for gigs.  The pay is decent for a solo player, but don't expect a lot of attention to be paid to you by the patrons or for the other room to turn down the jukebox.  

New patio is very nice as well."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service. 

You'll get bad service any time of the day, any day of the week. By awful, I mean 20 minutes for a beer, 45 minutes for your salad, over an hour for your meal. Had lunch with a few friends on a Sunday afternoon and we were stuck there for about 2 1/2 hours. This is bar food, not haute cuisine. 

They used to do wing night, but now it's boneless wing night, and they're terrible."}
{"text":"I hate this place because i tried to prank call them when I was in the bar and they knew it was me. Never going back. Other than that it's a good place. Kelsey and Catie are the best."}
{"text":"Last night I tried their tacos for the first time... these tacos were the best tacos I have ever ordered from a restaurant, ever. The lady at the window had the perfect amount of bad ass to her.. the plates of tacos she delivered to our table were glorious, each one looked perfect, obviously made with love. The were absolutely delicious. I cannot explain the amount of excitement I have to find out these tacos are offered two times in one week, can't wait till Monday!"}
{"text":"I go to this bar solely because it is the closest to my house.

I can't understand why everyone likes the tacos. I mean I get them every time, but they are not good. at all. And I'm never sure if I'm supposed to tip the woman when she brings them out. Anyone?

Pitchers are cheaper during sporting events and the vibe is definitely more of a dive bar on the one side, which I like. This is not where the yuppies go, in case you're looking to escape that scene. 

Oh, and free popcorn you help yourself to, in case you were hoping  to help Cleveland fatten up just a little more."}
{"text":"This place is known for Patty's tacos on Mondays and Thursdays. Dished up by two women that are only there to make delicious tacos, these rock! The shells are fried tortillas and the beef has delicious flavor. I've learned my lesson not to order the hot sauce, I like spicy - but this stuff is really hot, like makes me sweat hot! I order the medium sauce which is perfect for me. It can get really busy on Thursdays especially!

The draft selection is usually pretty great. When I was there last week they had rotational taps for Nugget Nectar and a Clown Shoes Belgian IPA, among others. They also have some solid permanent taps like Fatheads Headhunter and Victory Golden Monkey.

I usually don't have a problem with the bartenders there, but it always seems to be someone new working each day. The only problem I had was after a visit on Monday, when the guy working was completely rude. I asked him what their happy hour specials were and he responded, \"you don't know what happy hour is?!?!\". I responded that I do indeed know what HH is, which is why i asked what the specials were. The specials included $1.50 domestic draughts, which didn't really interest me, so I asked for a draught list, and he snapped saying that they were in the process of changing it. So I glanced over at the taps, and he once again snaps - \"what are you looking at!?!\". I just ordered a budweiser and got the hell outta there. As I said, this isn't the norm - but I won't be sticking around if I see that guy working."}
{"text":"So many good things to say about Merry Arts! One of my favorite pub/restaurants in Lakewood to eat/drink. They have specials every day of the week and they are pretty good deals. Very fair prices on food and drinks, especially during happy hour. Come here to catch a game and you can enjoy your own private TV inside your booth while you eat/drink.

One thing that you absolutely must try are the tacos. Tom Hanks himself (yes, the actor) has raved about how these are some of the best tacos he has ever had. On Thursdays they shut down the menu and solely offer these ground beef tacos in all of their flaky shell goodness. At $2 a pop they are a steal. You can order them hot or mild and if you want any minor customizations make sure you let the cook know. It can get busy but they are worth the wait.

Another favorite deal of mine is on Fridays they have 20 cent mussels! Order twenty of these bad boys and it will only set you back 4 bucks. They have a delicious fish fry also during lent and throughout the year.

This is a terrific spot to start out with a meal before a night out drinking or to just stop for a nice casual experience any day of the week. Get here!"}
{"text":"The Merry-Arts is a nice place to watch a game or meet-up with friends on a weekend. The mood is always jolly and you could easily get caught up here and end up spending the entire evening in just this bar. 

They often have live music. 

It is also home to Cleveland's own version of the Soup Nazi, the Taco Nazi. Prepare your order ahead of time."}
{"text":"We tried to enjoy a meal and a couple of drinks tonight.  We sat at a table for more then fifteen minutes and not one server approached us.  We tried to order at the bar and was ignored there as well.  Very bad experience.  We drove up the street to a competitor and enjoyed the rest of our evening."}
{"text":"I've had better service at 4am at a Jack in the Box.  Its not so much that I mind being completely ignored by the staff, sitting an hour while I wait for my food, or being subjected to \"Jersey Shore Shark Attack\" on the tv while there were at least a half dozen sporting events that I would've rather watched. Nor do I so much mind being lied to by the surly waitress who announced that she wasn't working before heading off to the other side of the building to serve drinks to people who weren't me. Or that I missed 80% of the baseball game I went here to watch because this place just doesn't care about half of their real estate.

No, wait I'm pissed about all these things.  If I wanted to be completely ignored by unattractive meth addict white trash prostitutes, I could've done that for free somewhere that bothered to get me boozed up before treating me like the throwaway, rickets infested children that they left at home alone, probably feeding on and showering in their own filth."}
{"text":"This place had great prices for drinks, lively crowd, and good food to help soak up the alcohol you'll be consuming.  Nice servers.  There isn't a lot of seating, but still can fit a good size crowd in there.

I came here to watch and cheer on the US during the World Cup.  Great atmosphere that filled up with tons of diverse soccer fans...chants, quips, yells, and cheers were heard from the streets surrounding."}
{"text":"Went for the tacos and couldn't get a beer. Waited patiently (they weren't even that busy) but no luck. Had to leave without enjoying the tacos. I will say the woman taking care of the tacos was working her butt off, the bartenders could learn a thing or two from her."}
{"text":"Great food, cheap drinks, awesome patio! Great service too! .50 cent jumbo wings on Tuesdays and there are so many sauces to choose from. Live accoustic music on the weekends too"}
{"text":"The reviews up here are very accurate and prepared me well for my experience here.. Good food, God awful service. 

Went on Friday around 7:30 and it was fairly busy but not packed. Me and my 3 friends sat ourselves and waited about 10 minutes for the bartender to come over. There are at least 20 tables and 2 bars in this place and I only saw two employees (one for each bar and each took half the tables). Please hire more people! I don't get why they were so short staffed.. 

Anyway, waitress was nice but just couldn't possible get to everything in time so it wasn't her fault but it was a bit annoying.  There is a good beer selection and it's a nice menu with a good amount of options (2 vegetarian sandwiches, FYI). I got the SOHO wrap and it was good but not amazing. Homemade chips were solid. Spinach and artichoke dip was meh but it was also cheap so you get what you pay for! 

Overall, it took way too long but we knew that going in so it was a pretty decent evening anyway!"}
{"text":"One side a typical bar with some tv's at the bar, the other side has tv's at each booth. 
I went on a wednesday and they had half price apps and bogo burgers.  Can't go wrong with that.  They also have a taco nights that involves ordering from what I can only describe as the Taco Nazi."}
{"text":"Pattys Tacos are a staple in my life. The service is always amazing, and the staff is beyond friendly. As a bartender myself I know how it can be when you are super busy and the girls behind the bar stay friendly and calm- even when people are being super demanding! I only really go on Mondays and Thursdays for taco nights, but I try to make it there at least once a week for one of them. If you haven't tried the tacos here- you truly are missing out in so many ways- on a great taco and experience!"}
{"text":"Solid bar grub, free popcorn, and attractive bartenders. Great place to watch sports too!"}
{"text":"I came here for taco night in the summer, and since there haven't been any reviews of their tacos yet I thought I'd throw my opinion out there. What's that you say? There are already 30 taco reviews? Too bad I already started writing. 

I'll start by saying the patio was awesome for a summer evening. A very nice place to grab a beer and enjoy the weather. One person even brought a dog, which might be off-putting to some, but I got tipsy and pet it so I was happy as a clam. As for the tacos... Yikes. They're basically ground beef (cooked not drained), Old El Paso salsa (choice of medium or hot!), and a shell to soak up all the grease and salsa-water. The service was pretty lousy on the patio, but our waitress was attractive so my friends all tipped handsomely. We ended up taking turns running inside to order beers. After two rounds of tacos (we wanted to make sure they were still bad after round one. They were.) and an unknown number of drinks, we all looked at each other and agreed to go get some real food. We ended up at another restaurant on the block. 

Final verdict: despite the soggy, greasy tacos and poor service I give it two stars because the patio was nice and the beer wasn't very expensive. Also I pet a doggie when I was there and that's worth at least one star to me."}
{"text":"I went around 3pm so understandably the service was a little slow but the waitress was incredibly nice and helpful and able to manage the whole restaurant and bar by herself. The food itself was delicious. I got the honey mustard wrap and my parents both got steaks and we were all pleased. And it was so inexpensive! It had the bar atmosphere with the good service and clean feel of a sit down restaurant"}
{"text":"Went in tonight to watch the game and for Patty's excellent tacos. Bar room was full, my husband went into bar to get us a couple of beers. He was waiting for at least 15 minutes and never got served. No wait staff on tonight and the 3 bartenders could not handle the modest crowd. We left, no beers, no tacos, just annoyed. Too bad the bartenders weren't able to work  as hard as Patty, who was serving up her tacos all around."}
{"text":"Merry Arts is the total package.  Fantastic food and drink specials. Had the bogo  burger on a Wednesday  and it was awesome. The burgers are made with a good fresh hand formed party that was grilled perfectly  to my asking. Service is consistently great. If you have not been here then you are doing yourself a disservice."}
{"text":"Alex is the best behind the bar! Super funny and quick service! Love the taco night and the patio here."}
{"text":"Always get great service. Been going there for several years on Sunday for STEAK NIGHT...yum! Great outdoor patio that also has a covered heated area for cold nights."}
{"text":"This review is mainly about taco night. Not sure why everyone is crazy about the tacos. This is the list of choices, ground beef, with or without sour dream, hot medium or mild.  Really?  Ok. Everyone is raving. Been coming here for years on taco night.....really?  I won't be back. Waaaay too salty. A puffy greasy shell. Bottled salsa. Cheap paper plates and plastic forks. Big deal. Life is too short to eat bad food. Way better choices within walking distance. 

Ok, it was really cheap. $1.50 draft beers and $2.00 tacos. Service was fine. Pretty crowded for a Monday. Lots of people to talk to. Lots of TVs. Rear patio is new and nice. Lots of parking in the rear."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Lakewood spots--laid back, always friendly people there. The staff is also super nice.

Drinks are reasonable, and as far as the food I've only had the tacos...AWESOME! 

Go for the deal on Monday's and Thursday's (I think they are a little over a dollar, and well worth it)."}
{"text":"Wings-bomb
Tacos-bomb
Beers- solid selection
This is a true gem of Lakewood 
What else could you want in a divey bar that is home to USA soccer fans?"}
{"text":"I have been to Merry-Arts a few times for lunch now, given its proximity to where I work and its absolutely great value. The Lake Erie perch here is delicious, and a must-have during Lent. The service is great, and I would like to call out a particular waitress/bartender who works lunch hours on Fridays (I wish I remembered her name)...she is always full of energy, incredibly friendly, and a pleasure to be served by."}
{"text":"Not sure what was going on. It was my first visit, the lady-friend suggested it. My sister loves the place and many friends enjoy going here so I was happy to finally be there. 

Arrived after 1am on a Weds night and sat on the patio. We were the only ones out there. After a few minutes a gentleman came out saying the patio was closed but we could stay as long as we used an ashtray (neither of us smoke). The lights were on out there as were all of the TVs. He was a little rude, but whatever. Maybe thirty mins later he came back out and yelled again that we still had a tab and we needed to get inside as the patio was closed. 

Clearly he wanted to go home, it was a Weds night. I get it, I've worked service industry for over a decade. But it was pretty rude. We got inside and the bartender was really nice. We thought we were getting kicked out and had to pay our tab and she asked if we wanted another drink as it was last call. We obviously didn't after being kicked out of the patio. 

As I said, I get it, you want to close early on a Weds night when you've only got a few customers. But I've heard a saying 10% is the message, 90% is the way you say/deliver the message. Definitely could have been handled better. 

I should have read the other reviews on Yelp as rude service seems to be a common theme here.  Definitely too many other, better spots that are more welcoming in LWood to come back here."}
{"text":"I am in love with their burgers! The Ranch burger is my favorite. It's a awesome place to have your Sunday Funday, or just grab a bite to eat or drink anytime of the week. It's an inexpensive place, so that's a bonus. Service was little slow today (sometimes its spot on, all places have their off days). I would give 5 stars but they gave my friend his silverware wrapped in a dusty napkin...kinda gross. Haha, the look on his face was priceless. 
If you haven't been here before make sure you check it out sometime...just maybe bring some extra clean napkins."}
{"text":"Now the last thing I wanna do is give this place a bad rating BUT....... My brother has been a customer and going to this place dropping his cash for 25 plus years.. Always raved about how good the food and the service is and just a good ole place to relax and drink ... Until St Patrick's day 2017, He goes in for a st paddy dinner      ( cabbage & corned beef and little potatoes and carrots) The bar was packed rightfully so after all its the day of the Irish, Brings the food home to enjoy and low and behold.... The corned beef was under-cooked and tough as shoe leather not to mention the cabbage quarter was almost raw and not cooked enough . The only part of the meal that was edible were the small potatoes and carrots. He spent 11 bucks on a dinner that he couldn't even eat. Now you would think a place like this and a place he has been spending his cash and his time for 25 plus years at would of took a little more time to make sure they put out a completely cooked St Patrick's day meal.  So Thanks for nothing Merry Arts,"}
{"text":"I used to love going to this place but each time I go back the service is worse and worse. The bartenders always seem so pissed off with each other and some want you to know it for some reason. The food is pretty standard (in a good way), the tacos are really tasty. I took away stars because the service really bugs me, since it could be such a laid back place and there's no reason for attitude towards really nice people. Then again, I could be going on those off days. 

They have keno!!!! My money got stuck in the machine and the bartender wouldn't help me located the number on the machine to call for my money back. Not only that, but she pretty much tried everything in her power to ignore my situation. There were other bartenders and maybe 15 people in the whole place-she had time to give me the number at the very least. I was very nice about it."}
{"text":"My favorite bar to go to for a chill and relaxing night! Not a ton of 21 year olds which I love but young enough that me being 28 is a great time. Food there is pretty good too! been here to many times then I can count! Needless to say I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Classic divey sports bar with good food and great service. Came in to watch a Columbus Crew game, as they are the supporters bar, and it turns out their channel subscription just expired. Manager and owner went above and beyond to get the channel back for our group. Cheers!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite Lakewood bars. The buffalo chicken dip with pita chips is awesome! I'll decide to go for the dip alone."}
{"text":"I love this bar. Just don't eat the food, particularly the popcorn from the popcorn machine!!!!! One of the workers kept reaching in and eating it with his bare hands. Disgusting. And also weird. Who does that right in front of customers?!"}
{"text":"Do you like homemade taco's that cost less than 2$ each? Then come here any Monday or Wednesday.  There is a sign that says \"This isn't Burger King, You'll have it my way!\" but trust her, because she makes amazing taco's.  You have the option of mild, medium or hot, and she handles it from there. 

Worth it - go check it out!"}
{"text":"Taco Thursdays?! Yes please! The ladies do a wonderful job and I highly recommend coming out to try the tacos, and staying for a drink or two."}
{"text":"Merry Arts is honestly one of my favorite places in Lakewood.  It is right in downtown Lakewood and it has that 'casual neighborhood bar' type feel to it.  The food and drinks I've tried are all delicious and their specials are awesome.

Mondays and Thursdays they have \"Taco Night,\" where this woman named Patty takes over the kitchen to serve her homemade tacos.  On these nights, the rest of the menu does not exist, so don't go here if you want something besides tacos.  They are only $2 each and are the best tacos I've ever had.

My other favorite special is \"burger night\" on Wednesdays where they serve 2-for-1 burgers.  The burgers are around 7 or 8 dollars and then you get the second one free! And they are large burgers too! I always get the burger with bbq sauce, cheese, grilled pineapple and bacon.  YUM.

I've also had a handful of their appetizers, which have all been great as well.  Make sure to try the buffalo chicken dip when you check out the place.  It's served with warm pieces of pita. 

The service is usually pretty good as well.  Some people have complained that they're slow to approach you, but in my opinion, it's worth the wait.  

Overall, I haven't had many complaints about this adorable pub.  ...Which explains why I can be found there often. :)"}
{"text":"5 Stars for taco night! Doesn't seem like it would be a good place on regular nights but I don't know for sure. Taco night is a must!!"}
{"text":"Sorry Merry-Arts, but the tacos were so greasy we both got heartburn in a few hours of eating them.  Disgusting and dripping with grease.  I recall these tasted really good 10 years ago and we haven't been there since and until last week.  Oh we felt so sick.  On the plus side, the staff is very nice.  I'd never say this until that visit but if in the area craving tacos, go to Taco Bell down the street for Doritos locos tacos supreme. :)"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: 99% of my 5 star rating is based on taco night alone.  Best bar tacos in the Lakewood/Cleveland area I have ever had.  They're just... so good.  Tom Hanks agrees (Google it.)  The taco magic happens on Mondays and Thursdays and it's Soup Nazi style.  Just walk up to the kitchen and order.  And don't let Patty intimidate you.  She's just a no nonsense kinda gal.  Cash Only at $2/ea.  Free popcorn.  I'm in.  I've had some of their other food too and it's pretty impressive too.  The Cuban sandwich and Cajun fries we excellent.  
The atmosphere is laid back with a really beautiful patio they just built a couple of summers ago.  The bartenders are all fast and friendly so no complaints there.  It's Merry Arts.  It's a Lakewood landmark.  And the tacos are good."}
{"text":"Nice people. Great service. Of coarse I forgot the inn keepers name but made a nice visit for my bride and myself. Neighborhood inn, everything we ate was great. A place to go back to."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places in Cleveland. Newly revamped with an amazing outdoor patio in the back loaded with tv's, tables, and heaters. Huge beer selection and can't forget about Patty's taco's on Monday and Thursday's. They also provide daily specials esp Pitcher and steak sundays!"}
{"text":"The more the merrier! What a awesome find underneath an unsuspecting awning. I must have hit the jack pot but there was a Cavs watch party the night I went that had members of the scream team and Tito's vodka present, aka free goodies!!! Pretty chill atmosphere, taco mondays and Thursdays is cash only so be aware!!! I loved the tacos, definitely hit the spot. Patty takes great care of you and it looks like she makes it all herself. Service is quick and efficient, minimum 10 dollar credit card at the bar and you pay separate for the tacos. Can't wait to go back and try some more food!"}
{"text":"This is a nice, neighborhood-feeling place. People are friendly, staff is accommodating and kind. The noise level is a little much for my old self, but it seems like a fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere. Attentive staff. Comfortable experience. Will go back real soon. -Positive Impressions"}
{"text":"Where has this place been hiding? I met some friends here last night for their taco night -- $2 beef tacos (cash only) where you pick your sauce, answer yes or no to sour cream, and that's it. Simple and satisfying -- nothing more, nothing less!

Although we stuck with the tacos, they have an extensive menu I'd like to try when I go back. And they have delicious popcorn while you're waiting, which smells amazing. Food and bar service was quick and friendly, which deserves an extra thumbs up with how busy it was last night. And drink prices were good.

Overall, I dig the vibe of the place -- casual and comfortable with TVs everywhere, darts, and more for a low key night at the bar. Merry, indeed!"}
{"text":"OK OK I know I frequent Patty's tacos, but I just can't get enough! Went last night, (Thursday) around 6:30/7PM, bar was packed, went straight to the back kitchen, ordered and Patty herself even help us find seating. So nice! Cheap beer $2 drafts, and Patty came and found us to make sure she knew where we were before she made our food, how sweet is that?! $10 for 6 amazing tacos! Great experience, plus the popcorn machine was a fun touch that makes me happy. :)"}
{"text":"The food is good.  Especially now since they have expanded to a full menu, any day of the week.  However, the table service is far from good.  For two months, I went there on the same day of the week, ordered the same special.  Each time, the same waitress (a short hair blond) refused to come to my table to take an order.  I would watch as she looked right at me, but still would pretend that she was too busy to even drop a menu.  The first time this happened, I did not tip very well.  The next time this happened, I tipped very well thinking that I could repair whatever damage was done.  Every time even after this, she still ignored me.  Do not go here if you are alone or are not in their group of friends.  You may wait way too long to get served."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place in Lakewood! You have to love a good Irish bar! The place is huge and they often have live music! The patio is nice as well. 
I have yet to be in for tacos but after reading reviews, that's my next stop!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a wing crawl.  Placed was packed.  Both bars were open and we got beers suprisingly fast!  The wings line..i different story.  It wrapped around the corner and took forever.  When they did bring out wings it was in little groups of like 8 samplers.  WAYYYY more efficient way of doing this..lol.  Bathrooms are still gross too..  But any place that has Pumking and pours a good Guiness will keep me in there for a bit.  ;)"}
{"text":"I was here once in 2012 to hang out with friends and my husband after dinner because it was in walking distance from the restaurant we are at and I was 7 months pregnant and not about to walk 3 blocks. It was really packed but my husband said the beers were good and decently priced. There was a huge brown leather sofa in the corner which I waddled over to and we hung there for about an hour. It's like a Lakewood dive bar with leftover furniture from your moms basement obviously decorated by a dude. I weirdly felt at home as my brother had all those same factors in his home decor for years. The sports was playing on the tv so if you're into the sports, this is the place for you. I liked it there. I don't really drink much so if I do, I head to a bar more geared towards my nerd girl self, two in Lakewood come to mind. Also, if you young folks know who actor Tom Hanks is, he used to frequent the Merry Arts when he did the Great Lakes Theatre Fest back in the day. So pop in, grab a brew and yell 'Wilson!!!' Or something funny from the Burbs. Your choice ;)"}
{"text":"Great place to come and watch a soccer match. New home for AO Cleveland, super friendly staff, great food, awesome breakfast on early match games.  They have really gone out of their way to accomodate the group."}
{"text":"Patty's Taco nights on Monday and Thursday are the highlight of my week. 

Picture Flash fried soft taco shells -- perfectly filled with taco fillings (ground beef, lettuce, cheese, tomato -- and whatever \"spiciness\" of sauce you prefer. 

Note  - this is a place that serves tacos ONLY on taco night... and Patty and her mother serve them only ONE way, (the best way ever!) 
(order at the kitchen door -- note how MANY tacos each person wants (per plate) and what spiciness - mild, medium, \"herb's\" (=med and hot) or Hot,  and if you want Sour Cream -- and then you go and sit, order a pitcher of beer, and wait for patty to bring the tacos --before you leave, you go back to the kitchen, and pay her :) CASH only)"}
{"text":"A busy bar with solid food good specials and reliable service. Lisha and Jackie are top notch. My favorite nights to visit are Wednesday (241 burgers) and Sunday ($13 filets w/ 2 sides). 

The patio is large and inviting but it closes at 11 pm dues to Lakewood Ordinances. Otherwise, I recommend you give the wings a whirl (get them well done because they are big ones). The roast beef grinder was light and tasty. The aloha burger and the smoker are outstanding, especially with a side of their seasoned fries. 

Help yourself to some tasty popcorn while you wait for your order.  

Disclaimer: if you go in for a playoff game or big event (no hockey does not count!! You're in Cleveland) get their early or you will be seatless and fighting for your drink."}
{"text":"This place has the best taco in the world. (only on taco night)   If you love tacos, you gotta try this place.  I can't speak for any other item on their menu since I only order Taco when I am there.  However, If you want to try what best taco taste like, you have to try it"}
{"text":"My review is only for the tacos. They are amazing. You stand by the kitchen door and order however many tacos you want. Then you sit down and patti will bring your tacos. You can pretty much pay whenever.....when she brings them, when ordering at the kitchen door, or even right before you leave. She never seems too worried about it. Monday night is usally less crowded for taco night, so i would recommend going then."}
{"text":"The oldest bar in Lakewood, cheap drinks, great tacos. Come here for some cheap eats, cheap beer, and a local hangout."}
{"text":"My dad and I really wanted to watch the University of Cincinnati football game versus South Florida while we were in the western Cleveland suburbs a few weekends ago. I did a quick search online to see if there was any sort of Cleveland alumni group but I didn't find much other than an event listing for a game watch at Merry Arts Pub & Grille earlier in the season for the NC State game. After a quick phone call to the bar, and a phone call back from them, we were on our way to the bar.

I knew we were in for a treat when we walked in after kickoff to find that the game was already on the biggest screen in the bar and the sound from the game was on too! And it only got better from there. Their beer list was really good, and we later found out that they were all really affordable pints too. This is your classic neighborhood watering hole and we watched as many regulars arrived at the bar with their newspapers in hand, ready for a long Saturday at the bar.

Being that the game started at noon, eventually we were ready for some lunch. I had read many reviews mentioning their tacos, but soon realized that they are only available on select days. Eventually I settled on the turkey panini. This isn't a thin sandwich from a panini press but a thick grilled sandwich topped with french fries, cole slaw, and tomatoes. I've had sandwiches similar to this in Pittsburgh, but wasn't aware that they were available outside of the steel city. This sandwich was very good and the onion rings were awesome!

My dad went with the slider basket with seasoned fries. I did not sample the sliders but my dad said that they were very good. Their seasoned fries were also a nice touch. The basket did have four sliders, but I couldn't snap a picture before my dad had already devoured one of them. Distance runners sure do have a ferocious appetite. We stuffed ourselves full of great food and watched as the Bearcats went on to win the big football game."}
{"text":"Merry Arts makes (what might be) the best tacos in CLE.

Try the hot with sour cream. To die for. Literally. With the deep fried soft shells, greasy meat and chunky salsa (which the sour cream cuts, just a little bit), one might have a clogged artery or two if you eat too many. But that's the beauty, because these babies are filling! After two and a beer, I'm good. 

Speaking of beer, they have lots of it. And its cheap.  For $8 you can get two tacos and a Brooklyn Lager, plus tip. Talk about a cheap date!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night with my husband for a beer and to watch the start of a Cavs game while our son was at baseball practice.  The place was busy, but it's a lot larger than what it first appears.  When you go inside there are two sides to the place with bars in each and plenty of TVs. In addition to that they have an outside area with several bistro tables, a lounge area with couches and I believe two TVs.  The day was somewhat brisk, but warm enough to sit outside so that's what me and my husband did.  There was a fire burning nearby and I was able to get some warmth from that - it was a nice touch. 

It was buy one get one free burger night so my husband and I ordered burgers.  Unfortunately, it took almost 30 minutes for the food to come out.  If the CAVS game didn't provide some distraction I probably would have been really impatient, but our server did check on us periodically.  When the food came out I thought the fries were pretty badl - tasted like they were microwaved and probably was sitting out for a while before our server went and got it.  The fries were not hot.  I appreciated that my burger was cooked medium and overall it was just \"ok\" - no wow factor there.  My husband seemed to enjoy his burger though.

Overall the atmosphere (although crowded) was good, prices were good and service was good too.  I'll probably think twice about going here for food probably a better place to go just to have drinks and watch sports."}
{"text":"Went there on a Wednesday night, started to die down around midnight. Kelsey the bartender didn't live up to her stealing ways as Seamus suggests, she was pleasant fun and made a mean drink called a kelcunender!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for taco night and had not been there for over 10 years.  The $2 tacos on Thursdays are such a deal.  They are delicious and it's so cute to see the women making them back in kitchen while taking orders and running them to the tables!  They are super friendly and hard working! If you come for the tacos, it is cash only.  You can order drinks separately at the bar where cash not needed.

Due to the high amount of orders, it may take a while to get your food.  So be prepared to wait, but enjoy some Keno, sports on TV or drinks from the bar.

I do have to caution the DD's: their soft drinks are $2!  I find that a little high for a Coke, but I guess they have to make up the cost of tacos somewhere!

Looking at all the ads throughout the bar, they seem to have some good drink specials, especially for Indian's games.  If you go to a game, bring in your ticket for a drink deal.

I like the laid back atmosphere and was surprised to find out it is a sister bar to the Clevelander, another good local bar downtown."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and I love it. Wanna get drunk for really cheap? Come to Marry Arts! They have super cheap drinks just about any day of the week. I don't remember if it's a $10 minimum every time, but it for sure is on the weekends. I haven't had the tacos yet, or much of the food at all, but I will definitely be trying them soon. 

It's a decent sized place with a heated patio out back. It's great just about any time of year. I have seen it completely packed for the world cup and football games for NFL and college. They sometimes have live music in the East bar room."}
{"text":"They're semi-new back patio is fantastic.  Nice cocktail tables, lovely flat screen, and even a fire place.  

The inside is your typical Lakewood bar, but have had good service and bar food.  Claw machine allows for endless entertainment for the children of your group."}
{"text":"Breakfast on the back patio at Merry Arts on a sunny Saturday morning in Lakewood was perfect!  We brought our dog along for the Pooch on the Patio brunch and couldn't have had a better time.  Our dog got her own bowl of water and could've had her own breakfast but we chose to share our bacon rather than order off the pooch menu--which could have passed for a tasty breakfast for humans too!  We had a medium size cheese omelet with tomatoes, bacon and peppers served with toast from homemade wheat bread and nicely crisp home fries.  We also  had a short order of pancakes which was more than enough--3 light pancakes served with 2 slices of bacon.  With as much coffee as we wanted and a waitress who was prompt and friendly-- all for $15.78- we were delighted.  Go with your pup and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service is not very good.  Order two drinks at a time.  They seem to cater to the
men and not the women.  Hard for a woman to get waited on at the bar. I hear this from
many females.  Sometimes there is waiter service at the tables and sometimes not.

Food is ok. Popcorn is ok.  Drinks and beer are cheaper here than most other bars in the
area. Excellent tap selection. 

The music is usually pretty good. Although they can get in a country rut.

They have a wonderful outdoor patio. With a fireplace. 

Tacos are cheap and average."}
{"text":"I think Tom Hanks is fantastic. He thinks the tacos here are fantastic. Or he did in 1987. I try to stay out of Lakewood because I grew up there and don't like running into people who want to ask about what I have been up. I always end up saying \"Oh not much\" or I just go on weird tangents to get them off my case. Same reason I am not on Facebook. I guess the only reason I would get on Facebook would be to try to rekindle some old flames that I didn't know how to properly light when I was a youngster. Who am I kidding, I probably still wouldn't know. Merry Arts is cool because it is not the typical dork crowd of the west side of Lakewood. It is a very warm and cozy place. Sunday is steak night. The tacos are good. The beer list is nothing to talk about. Kenilworth (K-Hole), Sloane Pub (Hairless Hamster), Lakewood Village and Merry Arts are my favorite bars in Lakewood. Shamrock Rest in Peace."}
{"text":"I can't believe I never knew about this place. I loved the vibe and will be back. 

There is a rather large food menu. The turkey club was large and tasty. The chips were a good side option. My friend's food had hair in it though and the kitchen service was a bit slow for a few sandwiches, so there is that to consider.  

Once we ordered food we had a friendly server stop by the table repeatedly to check on us and offer more drinks. 

Prior to ordering though I stopped by one of the bars to order drinks for my friends and I. The bartender wouldn't serve just me though; she required an ID for each drink I ordered which I've never run into before. 

Darts was really my highlight of the evening. There are two boards in the smaller of the two spaces. It's a nice cozy corner to spend the evening. There was a nice fireplace in the smaller room as well and lots of TVs - even small ones at each booth."}
{"text":"Service sucks! We have been sitting for over 30 minutes and still no service at table. Place is not even busy and barmaids are space cadets!!!"}
{"text":"Before going my bf told me to google \"Tom Hanks\" + \"Patty's Tacos\"

I did...and umm...Tom loves Merry-Arts?  

I've been to Merry-Arts plenty of times.  They have live music, lots of TVs (including some that are at your booth) and good beer/drink specials.  

What I'd never experienced before was a Patty's Taco.  The tacos are served up ONLY on Mondays and Thursdays by two stout ladies wielding paper plates and nary a smile on their face.  Doesn't matter though because the tacos are darned good.  For $1.75 each you get a choice of three sauces (note: the hot is NOT hot), heaps of lettuce, meat plus onion filler, sour cream, cheese and probably tomatoes though I don't necessarily remember them.  I think the clincher was the shell though...it was super deep fried which gave it a nice home-made feel.  

So was Tom right?  Are these worthy of mentioning on Letterman?  Eh...maybe not.  They still tasted like tacos and I've had some pretty darned good tacos for $1.00 in this town before.  Even still, washing them down with cheap pitchers and watching football (ahem, truth?  Actually...the Sing-Off) on the booth TVs was worth it.  

Oh, Oh,  and before I forget...I liked the Patty ladies.  When we left we had to find the stouter one and pay for our tacos.  I appreciate the trust, plus getting handed change in the back alley by an old lady smoking was kind of the cherry on top of the night.  Maybe that's me...but it was sweet."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to meet up with friends for a drink. The bartenders are laid back and so is the atmosphere. They have everything you want/need in a town bar. Good food, jukebox, keno, and comfy seating."}
