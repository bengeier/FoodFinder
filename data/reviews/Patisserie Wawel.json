It is a small place with no place to sit (a very small table only) but the owner is very friendly and open to answer your questions"}
{"text":"This review is only for Wawel's Polish cheesecake. I had it last night at a potluck and *boy* was it good. I actually haven't been to the pastry shop myself, but thought it was worth sharing this find. 

Polish cheesecake (sernik) is different from American cheesecake, as it uses a cottage-like cheese (quark) as main ingredient. This gives the cake a slightly grainly mouthfeel and a lighter consistency. I find it just as rich and filling, though, but not too sweet, which is nice. Although Wawel's cheesecake looks plain, its taste is enhanced by a thin layer of rose jam between the crust and the cheese layer. The whole thing is then gently doused in casting sugar. 

I actually would much rather have Wawel's cheesecake than that of, let's say, Cheesecake factory. The latter's may look much fancier, but the former is the polished result (pun well intended) of decades of pastry craft. 

Looking forward to visit the pastry shop!"}
{"text":"I have found that every non-French culture with their own version of French pastry usually misses the mark by a mile. (I'm looking at you, Portugal. I love your bread, but why are you making croissants?) Usually you end up with something dry, yeasty, sweet, and not croissant-like at all. The thing is, this place had croissants, chocolatines, and brioche à la cannelle and they were all delish. Not traditional, but not merely an empty shadow of what they should be. The croissants were nice and buttery, though not flaky, and the brioche, warmed up at home, was full of cinnamon and raisins and really quite nice.

They also do cakes and other pastries, and have a couple of little tables for sitting with a cup of coffee.

FYI, they don't have decaf. Just, you know, if you were curious."}
{"text":"Tiny Polish deli/pastry shop, specialising in Eastern European specialties. Particularly ponchiki .. jam filled doughnuts, and Packy... a type of cake usually eaten at Easter, and of course, babkas. Two tiny tables, usually occupied , for an afternoon tea/coffee with your ponchik.. the plum filled are super, as are the apricot,( but have never tried the vanilla cream filled), or pastry. Sadly, they no longer make sandwiches to either eat there or to go. Aside, from the sweet and deli, there are many different  breads that are  popular with the Eastern European set, as well as;  teas, juices and jams imported from Poland and environs.  Great little quiet place for a sit down ( table subject to availability) and an afternoon cup of tea or coffee with a yummy ponchik."}
{"text":"On my quest for delicious donuts I've been wanting to try this place for a while now. I finally did and they did not disappoint! They have 2 varieties available: the first one has a pastry cream filling with powdered sugar on top and the other one is glazed with plum jelly inside. Both were simply delicious and so fresh. The dough was soft and tasty, which is usually my first criteria for good doughnuts. The only thing that could have been better is that there really wasn't that much filling inside them. 

I've read other reviews mentioning how good their Polish cheesecake is, so I also purchased a slice to try. It has a crust, rose jam layer and a lighter and less sweet cheese filling that I also found to be just a bit citrusy. It was good, but my favorite variety still remains New York style cheesecake.

Only $6 for two donuts and a slice of cheesecake and they accept debit!"}
{"text":"Géniale pâtisserie polonaise qui offre de délicieux beignets fourrés à la confiture, pains et autres spécialités de la région. Franchement, leurs produits sont toujours frais et goûteux! Superbe référence dans le centre-ville si vous cherchez un dessert à apporter avec vous à un souper entre amis. 

Ils ont aussi une panoplie de produits de la région que l'on ne retrouverait pas ailleurs (du moins dans le quartier)- chocolats, biscuits en boîtes, sucreries, conserves, etc. 

À découvrir!"}
{"text":"The place is tiny, and has a good vibe with all the things it sells. I bought two typical Polish pastries according to the lady. I've never had Polish pastries so I won't say if they're authentic, but the quality of the raw materials don't seem to be super good. I'm pretty sure there were some artificial flavour in them...or maybe that's how it's supposed to taste..."}
{"text":"Have one next door, love the millefeuille à la crème  and the jelly filled donuts but not enough fillng inside"}
{"text":"A tiny polish bakery making fresh pastries every day! Sometimes they run out at the end of the day. I find this place a little awkward and tight, like I'm being watched at all times. There are two tiny tables for seating if you wish to stay.

They do ponchik here and is delicious! Very cheap also.

Service is ok."}
