{"text":"Decent food but very slow service. Don't go here if you're concerned about time.   We sat for 10 - 15 minutes, then I finally asked when we would be able to order. He apologized and said he was very busy. I thought he was kidding because half the tables were empty. He explained that he does a lot of takeout business and was trying to complete some orders.   That's fine, but you shouldn't be sacrificing one set of customers for another. Hire some wait staff, for crying out loud!  To his credit, he gave us some extra spring rolls and took a few dollars off of our bill.  However, I would have preferred simply getting our lunch in a reasonable amount of time.   The food, itself, was hot and tasty. No complaints there."}
{"text":"No. Just No. Sorry Spice Thai. You are in such a cool area,.. right next to the waterfront. I felt like my Thai food was assaulted by blandness...where was the Thai.? What happened to the spices and my tongue burning or possibly some flavor. You have such a cute thing going with your location and the funky d√©cor. The ambiance is just right, but the food is just not right."}
{"text":"absolutely love this place! I've been going ever since I moved to the neighbourhood and when my friends/family come visit they all request to have at least one meal there. If I need to bring a dish to a party I always pick up their fresh spring rolls (the best ever!)  The owner is always around and I've never seen him not smiling - even after they were closed for months this past winter due to flooding and subsequent renos. He's super nice and will modify the menu to suit your tastes. He's made me a number of dishes using tofu in various ways and they've all been delicious! Must have menu items are the cashew nut chicken, veg curry and the mango sticky rice. I've never been disappointed with any of the menu items!"}
{"text":"2 out of 5! Service is very slow. Food is average. Only positives are Thai cocktails and decoration! Not worth the price $$"}
{"text":"Its very westernised n has lost the authenticity of original Thai food . I lived in thailand all my life and find their food very customized. The most authentic food i had is from a restaurant called Khao San"}
{"text":"Portions are super small.  We ordered 5 appetizers and 8 entrees for 7 people and it wasn't enough. Service was also super slow and food was probably the worst tasting thai food I've had at a restaurant. It was also very dark inside."}
{"text":"I know and love Thai food.  This place is a joke. An evil, terrible joke that was played on my palette.  I can barely remember what we actually ordered, because what we got was *seriously different*. I think I asked for the spicy noodles with basil, but it was just salty, westernized sauce with noodles. Yuck. Not even spicy.  My friend got the Pad Woon Sen, and said it was closer to a Filipino dish called pancit than what she expected. And as far as pancit goes, it was just an alright representation of it anyway.  I can't remember what my other friend got, but she was equally unhappy.  Service was awkward and unpleasant. Decor was awkward, dark and unpleasant.   This place is unpleasant. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here for family day with my family, and I'm not disappointed. Eric was outstanding! Made us feel at home :)"}
{"text":"This is my go to place several times a week, I live local and really enjoy the authentic food and great staff, owner is always a pleasure to be around he always welcomes his customers with a smile. Restaurant is always clean and well taken care of."}
{"text":"I am a huge asian food lover. But for this place, I would not go again unless I am craving for just fried spring roll. The following are some dishes we ordered and seem like they are also the popular ones. 1. Basil Beef: Portion is very small, and this is the only Thai restaurant that I have been would not serve free rice accompany with dishes. I ordered Basil Beef, but it does not come with rice, you need to pay extra to get your own rice. So the total price for such small portion is unreasonable expensive. The beed is hard as one of the comments mentioned. If you want good basil dishes, I would recommend you to go get Thai express basil chicken stir fried. 2. Pad Thai noodle dis not taste fresh and a bit greasy. A little bit on the sour side for normal Pad Thai. 3. Coconut soup taste like a bowl of water adding in a lot of spices and couple pieces of hard chicken. Very flavourful but I am just not a big fan of it. 4. Fresh spring roll is not something that I would recommend. Feel like fresh spring roll is purely vegetarian thus no meat or shrimp inside. And the veggie inside the rolls are pickled veggies. I am just not a fan of the pickled spring roll. 5. Fried spring roll is really good and probably one of the best fried spring roll I've ever had so far.  6. The owner is very nice. But the service there is not as good. I have waited at the table for 10 minutes, servers kept walking by but no one came ask for drinks or gave me a cup of water.  One star for the owner and one star for the spring roll."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time today and we enjoyed it. Good service and tasty food. One star off because they don't include steamed rice with their veggie dishes - I think, for $11 per dish, they should definitely include it. Also, the Thai iced tea was too sweet for my taste, but your tastes may vary.   Overall good place. Would dine here again."}
{"text":"This was the worst Thai restaurant I've ever eaten at in my life. The food was obviously microwaved, the service was atrocious and the prices weren't even any good.  The server did not check up on us even once, and she brought the bill before we were done eating.  I honestly wish I'd grabbed a hot dog across the street instead. I would have been way more satisfied."}
{"text":"The food was not bad and I would eat here again I just found the menu items limited to what I have found to enjoy in Thai food and the portions a bit smaller than other Thai in the downtown."}
{"text":"The best Thai in the city. Very friendly owner, always smiling. The spring rolls are FANTASTIC. Easily the best in Toronto (ironically, I'm not a fan of the spring rolls at the Thai chain called Spring Rolls). The dishes are not too spicy, but you can always request to make them hotter if that's what you like. Mango chicken is my favourite, plenty of chicken mixed with a great selection of mango and colourful veggies. Convenient location to Harbourfront Centre or sporting events at Sky Dome or ACC. The plastic vine decor is kitschy but absolutely charming."}
{"text":"This mom and pop shop is slightly hidden away on Queens Quay - it was mildly busy on a Friday evening so service was quick and pleasant.   I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai. My first impression was that it wasn't much food for the price of $11.95 but the noodles are stacked pretty high so it's quite filling. However, I found that there was too much tamarind sauce. You can also tell the shrimp was simply dethawed and cooked, unwashed. I was left with the grimy unwashed ocean taste in my mouth, and the meat was often lukewarm. As much as I want to support local, the quality of food for the price just isn't worth it. Unless I'm really craving Thai food, I'd trek over to other notable Thai places in town."}
{"text":"Beware! Good Thai food, miserable management and service. True story: myself and three friends took the train from Windsor to Toronto. On our last day in the delightful city, we were all craving Thai food. Moments from our hotel, past the wine shops and mini grocery stores was a small Thai restaurant that boasted tacky decor but still appeared promising. Lured in by the scent of peanut satay, we asked for a table for four. Upon being seated, our drink order was taken, and then, shortly after that, our entree order was taken. An hour later and after several complaints, we received our cans of diet and regular coke. A half hour passed, and we finally received our main courses. Please note: we were the ONLY people in the restaurant when we placed our orders. Shortly after people trickled in. Not crowds, just three or four people, and one couple that consisted of a police officer. It took another hour or so for our bill, and then they continued to screw up by charging the wrong cards incredibly wrong amounts. When we politely complained to the owner, we had yet another charge card amount issue. After having all four cards charged amounts that far exceeded what we ordered, we made one final complaint. As fed up as we were, the owner asked us to leave and not come back, as though we were the problem, and we each notified our bank to monitor for any charges. The owner did one thing right, he did not process any of the charges. Do not waste your time."}
{"text":"Save yourself some money and go somewhere else. Tiny tiny portions (even by Canadian standards) and for 27$ a small portion of pad thai noodles and 2 cups worth of chicken curry. Taste: common. nothing special.  money wasted."}
{"text":"Convenient location to the Harbourfront and all it's summer events. However, if any food stands are open, maybe go ahead and give them a shot before coming here. Nothing special about the food. A complete lack of green and red curry dishes signals that the chef doesn't really know his Thai food. I had my fave Pad Soon Wen (Glass noodles). The vegetable mix in them was clearly from the freezer section, consisting of cubed carrot parts, peas, corn and green beans.  It reminded me of what my mom fed me when I was a kid. Forever I will think of this combo when I see green, yellow and orange colors together.  The chicken dish my companion tried to enjoy was full of globs of chicken parts, mostly not edible.  The decor is hideous- fake flowers, fake crochet everywhere!  If you live on the Harbourfront, it's probably decent for take out. But, my eat-in portion size was not very big.  Service was decent, despite a fairly full patio and restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was great and made fresh, love thw tom yum and spring rolls, basil beef is good too. Usual cone here for lunch and could not complain with the quality"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money! Some dishes were bland and some were merely salty. Thai ice tea just tasted like syrup. Non of rice or noodle was even average. Service was poor. I only enjoyed the imported beer here."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be my favourite restaurant in Toronto.  Used to be.  I used to bring everyone and their dog here, and any time anyone would visit me from out of town, you could be sure we'd be dining here for at least half the time.   This all changed in November 2007.  While the food here remains some of the best Thai food I have ever had, I was left very unimpressed with the owner.  He seems nice, but the problem is that he is very critical. Because I was coming in so frequently, he felt like it was okay to ALWAYS comment on how much I was eating! Who does that?!?!?!  Because I loved this place so much, I'd always go ravishing hungry, and yes, I'd eat an entire dish...or two. But shouldn't the owner of a restaurant be flattered by such an act?   In November 2007, I had just finished chowing down and the owner's wife was taking away my plates. She said something to him in another language and he thought I had left the restaurant, so at the top of his lungs he said \"MAN, THAT GIRL CAN EAT!\" I stood up and looked right at him, he bailed into the kitchen like a total loser. I was completely unimpressed and I went from going there at least three times a week, to never again.  November 2007 was when I boycotted this place and I haven't been back since. To be honest, the food isn't what left the bad taste in my mouth, the owner did."}
{"text":"Very nice owner and staff. Service can be a bit slow and they don't check up on you.   Patio and location are great. At first I was excited to find a Thai place just a short walk from home but unfortunately the menu is outdated and food is quite bland. In a city with places like Pai, khao san road and Salad king, below average Thai food just doesn't fly.   Food is a 1 star for me, the patio was great so 5 for location. And 3 for service because the few times I've been, they never checked up on me but they were cheerful and the beverages were cold!"}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch special pad Thai  (comes with a spring roll), it was pretty flavorful, but a little overpriced ($11.99)."}
{"text":"The wait was way too long.  Food was mediocre at best.  Completely overpriced for the portion.  Paid $12 for basically three bites of pad Thai.  Never coming again.  Highly recommend not coming too.  Owner is super emotional and yells at customers.  Not the proper way of retaining returning customers."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but small portions and overpriced.  Service was pretty bad as well.  There didn't seem to be anyone eating inside and there were only 5-6 small parties eating outside - yet the servers kept saying they were \"very busy.\"  Seated with no menu, so I waited for that, then ages to order, then had to flag them down to order a drink, get the check, etc.  Was never provided the usual condiments and for some reason their noodles are chopped into tiny pieces, making the whole dish soupy.  It tasted ok but I think it's one of those kind of places that benefit by being in a touristy area and therefore don't try very hard as they can get by without relying on repeat customers."}
{"text":"I was always wondering about this place. It's so close to the harbor front that it naturally attracts attention. However, even with all my love for Thai food I can't say I really enjoyed the place. First - the menu is not extremely vegetarian friendly. There are no vegetarian noodle dishes. They of course turn the regular pad Thai into veg one but considering that they are taking out shrimps and chicken I think the price for veg option should be significantly cheaper. Second - even though it has a nice seating area inside it felt more like a take away place than a restaurant. With only two tables taken it felt like we were too much of a burden for the staff who were running to pick up calls for takeaway orders.  And there was no ambience music.... It was just quiet there.... And our drinks were served by a guy who was wearing a jacket and scarf and a hat.... It was completely warm inside.... Anyway, I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I've only had takeout from this restaurant as I think there's much better options along Spadina. This is my go-to when I want affordable Thai food on my way home from work and I'm feeling lazy. Ordering online is simple enough, the portions are fair considering it's in a pretty touristy part of town. They've always been quick to bring my order when I walk in. If you ask for a medium or hot spice level, they seem to question you - as if they don't believe you actually want something with a little kick."}
{"text":"We ordered Golden chicken curry with 3 chillies (spicy) . It was good but did not come with any rice. We had to order rice separately . Service was good and prompt. Price is good for the quantity. Ample seating capacity.  It is not very visible from the main road, but the location is nice right in front of harbour front Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Heed the other warnings and run!  I initially wanted to check out a restaurant couple stores down but since they only accept debit/cash, we settled for some Thai.  Pros:  - Walking distance to Harbourfront and Steam Whistle - Lunch special till 3 PM  Cons: - Small portions (Note pictures) - Argued with me about the spiciness level I can handle because I'm a girl. Like, seriously? - Salty Pad Thai - Server used his FINGERS to add ice to the pitcher. - Meh service"}
{"text":"This place has an overall rating of 3 stars. Honestly, that is about right - and that's unfortunate because this place should have way more.  The Good: its located right on Queens Quay right in the middle of the action of the harbor. On pleasant days its great for dining outdoors and people watching. This place has so much potential if they tried a little harder on service to customers.   Food was just OK. It took a long time coming out and was nothing review and photo worthy. I was hungry I ate it. I think someone mentioned bland to describe the food - Id have to agree there. I really didn't order anything exotic though - I had pineapple shrimp fried rice.   The Bad: Service.. service was extremely bad! The man, who luckily was not my server, was so rude to his tables. My server, a young lady was way too forgetful. All I asked for was red wine and waters and it took about 20 minutes. The crazy thing is that it was actually moderate business on the evening I was there so I really didn't understand the extreme wait for water, drinks, and then food. The servers should definitely not be shouting at the guest \"learn some patience\" when they ask about the status of their water.  TIP TO FURUTE CUSTOMERS: Pack your patience, hydrate and snack before you arrive incase your service is slow.   TIP TO SERVERS: BE NICE and APOLOGETIC!! It may not be your fault that you are running kitchen, carryout orders, inside and outside tables on two/three people staff but its also not the customers' fault. Yelling should not be your response to inquiries."}
{"text":"Was never a big fan of this place but decided to give it another try as I was craving some Thai food.  Ordered shrimp crackers, pad thai, beef green curry and pineappe stir fry with shrimp as take out. The shrimp crackers were white smelled like oil (they put the crackers in a big ziploc bag) and the peanut sauce was cold. Rice tasted like cheap chinese food. Beef was hard as rock and the eggplants in green curry was black- seemed like they just put old, pre-deep fried eggplants in the curry. They put soy sauce and hot sauce in each food container.  The place is owned by Chinese and the food doesn't taste anything like authentic Thai food. Would not return."}
{"text":"Had their grilled chicken and the coconut milk soup and it was amazing; friendly service with a great view of the water right in the heart of harborfront. Would recommend to anyone in the mood for some amazing Thai food! ps they have some great options for beer as well!"}
{"text":"We saw this cute restaurant and stopped by after skating at harbourfront; I'm glad we did. I had the vegetarian curry and it was delicious. The ambiance is authentic and I love how the room is full of large trees. This tiny space is cozy and the hosts were very friendly - you can tell it's a family run place. Definitely check it out if you're wandering around the waterfront, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Was hungry when I came in, still hungry when I went out. Portions too small, food unsavoury. Can do it if you're starving, but if you have other options, then avoid going to this place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Thai food this is the place to go.  The only problem is the service is not very good.  My sister and I waited 10 minutes for someone to seat us and we had to wait a little while for someone to take our order.  The decoration in the restaurant makes it seem crowded even though we were the only people there and it is a bit tacky decor.  Otherwise the food is great... maybe it's best to just order take out from here?  If you don't mind waiting."}
{"text":"Worst food experience ever !  Went there last winter, it was super cold. We had to keep our coats on... Then decoration is ugly, they have a lot of fake plants that were all full of dust.   We ordered the chef famous Pad Thai. It was just ketchup noodles with cashews on top of it. We decided to return our plate and the owner came to our table to argue (no apology) with us. An other customer who just came in took our defence we just paid and the 3 of us left....  In a word, HORRIBLE, do not go there..."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the 1-2 star reviews here. I've been going to Spice thai since 2003. Derek (owner) is one of the friendliest guys I've ever met. He still remembers where I worked before (and changed jobs) still to this day.  The main things I get there are Pad Thai, Cashew Nut chicken, Thai golden noodles, the spring rolls, golden curry, and lemon grass soup.   If you like spice (which I do) tell him you want it spicy, or say the # of chili's (just like you would at a place like Salad king).  They really will do what you ask - you just have to ask them.   The lunch combo is a good amount of food and good value- not enough to make you fall asleep at work, but enough to satisfy you.   The patio is great in the summer, and the inside I think is unique and part of the charm of this place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure which was worse, the food or the service.  If the service had been any worse, we might have been spared eating the absolute worst Thai food I've ever had in my life.  We were the only people in the restaurant, so there was no excuse for the service to be so slow or for them to keep forgetting parts of our order.    At least the decor is appropriate. And by \"appropriate\" I mean it matches the quality of the food and the quality of the service, dingy and depressing.   Honestly, it really takes a talent to make something very spicy, yet with no flavor whatsoever.  It's not that it was too spicy. Even the \"four chilies\" items on the menu (very spicy allegedly) were about as spicy as a slim Jim.    You should come here if you are going to starve to death in the next five minutes and you have nowhere else to eat (although you will probably still have to wait about a half an hour to get served, so you'll die in this horrible place anyway). Or, you should come here if you want to play a prank on somebody that you know who really loves Thai food. Tell them that is the best Thai place ever, and then look at them blankly when they say \"holy shit, how could you say this place was good? I wouldn't feed this to a homeless person!!!\"  Then you can laugh and laugh at the prank you played on your friend by bringing them to what might possibly be the absolutely worst Thai restaurant on the planet."}
{"text":"I live down the street, and every time i've gone, i've been the only person sitting down. But people come in waves for takeout.  The food is pretty good and quite cheap. It's expensive compared to rock-bottom china-town, but haven't you grown out of that?  The owner is extremely polite. The service is fast (10 mins order to meal). And they also don't pester you too much mid-meal (which I like)."}
{"text":"Not the best Thai I've had ...  Price was steep to food ratio portion (small) ... the soup was in fact the smallest I've ever been presented with. The service was also lacking and not the friendliest of encounters. However on the Upside: The location is wonderful (right by the lake) and Decor although some might find cheezy i found very cozy almost like your away somewhere exotic.  So I guess All in All - you come for the location ... Thats it ... LOL ... Sorry guys"}
{"text":"AVOID. Overpriced, bland meals that fully take advantage of the area's tourist draw. The pad thai was incredibly average and in one of the smallest portions I've ever seen. Service was slow and other patrons were served before we were. I paid $30 for two dishes (no tip) and I'm no less hungry than I was before I arrived."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Basil Beef was bland and over spiced, hot and sour soup tasted like they used rotten mushrooms. Satay from frozen... You want good Thai food, go literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to give this place such a low rating but I feel I should perhaps warn others of my experience. My friend and I walked in and there were a few customers around in the restaurant. We chose a table in the middle of the room and ordered our food..everything was fine. There was a fly on my plate and so I swooshed it away. Later on, I saw a black dot on my friend's plate and pointed her attention to it. She lifted up the napkin and about 10-15 ants/bugs/potato bug escaped from under the napkin and crawled around on the plate. We notified the waitress immediately and told her we couldn't eat the food that we ordered. She apologized and we left. It's ironic because one of the first signs my friend notice was \"a pest-free environment 2015\" or something along that line.... If you eat here..please check your table for bugs."}
{"text":"As my favorite places in harbor front were all packed, it was a good chance to try this place.   The food is pretty good, the price is decent for the area. The patio on the side is in the shade which is good during the summer.  The service is ok. Nothing to complain at this first visit.   I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. Tough beef. Great owner named Eric. He doesn't care about the tough beef whenever I tell him but I'll go there for everything else. The wonton soup, Pad won sen? something noodle dish, and rice dishes are great! Oh I love his spring rolls (I can eat a bucket of those but I practice control). The Queens Quay view is special, you know the lake and boats... No parking but I always find a way. It's our restaurant go to for Blue Jay games. Check it! I'm hungry now..."}
{"text":"Went in at about 10.26pm(they close at 11) and they refused us.  They turned us away because they were perhaps too lazy to serve us. If you want people out before 11 put your closing time at 10.30. Thanks."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Delicious food and friendly owners at great prices. Clean and cozy place. We had the pad thai, golden chicken curry, and eggplant tofu, and they were all great."}
{"text":"This place deserves better rating than 2 stars people are giving. Decent food and super friendly owner."}
{"text":"I've had two visits here, having just the pad thai for about $10 both times. It was the definition of average -- I've had better, and I've had worse, but it was good enough. The pricing is decent and I'd still come again if I was in the area. The owner is extremely friendly if you come across him. The decor is a little cheesy, but the location by the harbourfront can't be beat. Sit outside on a nice summer day and enjoy the weather!"}
{"text":"Great lunch special. Plenty of food and real thai spice.  Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I was happy to find a no-fuss Thai cafe along the way while running errands. I went in looking for papaya salad which was not on the menu but was satisfied they at least had green mango salad w/chicken - one of my favorite Thai salads (see picture). The owner told me to sit outside \"at the single table\" but I went ahead and sat at a four top because it was shadier and there weren't many customers. The staff seemed friendly enough although the young girl seemed a bit confused when I requested spice condiments, and had to clarify twice. The green mango salad was more of the yellow kind but that was fine. Salad was tasty with side of rice and just enough to tie me over between breakfast-lunch."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the city? Maybe if you have never ventured far-afield but I think there is better Thai here in Toronto but I haven't found it yet. Stick to the basics and you'll be in good shape. Nice beer selection and cheerful waitstaff make up for the plastic jungle decor.  Try the mango salad for a summer treat to beat the heat."}
{"text":"Decent spring roll and Pad Thai. Friendly service, quick.  Best part is sitting outside enjoying the breeze and the view.  Relatively good deal. Wi-fi is also good quality which is helpful!"}
{"text":"The food is tasty, the lunch special prices are good, the owner is super friendly, and delivery orders have always arrived between half an hour and 45 minutes (sometimes sooner!), which is basically a miracle in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love this place. What makes it is Eric. He is one of the nicest people I have ever met in the restaurant business. Always smiling and happy to see you. The food is great. A solid pad thai!"}
{"text":"16 minutes! - That's how amazingly quickly our phoned-in pick up order was said to be ready. With the promise of previous delicious meals from Spice Thai on our minds, we promptly bundled up while barely containing our salivation and arrived soon after to be greeted by our glorious looming tower of take out.  The restaurant itself is a quaint little tropical paradise of bright colours. There are ornate decorative pieces and plants all around and even the drinks are adorned with cocktail umbrellas. It can be a cute date spot and that's what it looked like the few scattered tables were there for. For nights like this one when we just wanted to plop ourselves onto the couch in front of the big screen with a movie, few other nearby places can beat the speed and quality of Spice Thai.  Our spring rolls were crispy, wonton soup hearty, mango chicken sweet and tangy, cashew nut chicken chock full of colourful veggies, and basil fried rice fragrant and topped with large juicy shrimp. Although all the dishes were delicious on their own, we couldn't resist kicking it up a notch with the extra spicy chili sauce. Yowza!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times in the past  2 years and I have always found the service, food and atmosphere very good. The owner is very friendly and helpful, and will honour requests you make to any of the dishes on the menu. The house pad thai is very good and so is the mango salad. I am surprised at some of the negative reviews here, I have gone to Thai restaurants across the gta, and this is one of my favourites. It's small, clean and the food is cooked fresh. If you do go here, and like your food with more spice, less spice or cooked a specific way let them know, and I am sure this will enhance your dining experience here!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for solid, reasonably-price Thai in a convenient downtown Toronto location, Spice Thai Cafe is your place.  I dined on a weekday with a party of 9, and when we arrived we were the only diners. Luckily this emptiness was not a foreshadowing of what was to come. Our orders were taken quickly, and our food arrived shortly thereafter, with every order exactly right. I had the vegetarian lemongrass soup (perfect for a chilly Toronto evening) and the green mango salad without chicken (great flavors, but a little on the sweet side). We ordered mango and sticky rice for dessert, and this was by far the most beautiful and delicious thing we tried. The prices are reasonable, and the decor is almost jungly, with potted trees scattered throughout the dining area.  Is it the best Thai food ever? No, but it's still pretty yum."}
{"text":"This is the worst Thai restaurant I ever been to.  I'm a Thai person myself so I know the food was really bad.  Wrong ingredients was put into the dishes.  Perhaps the curry was the only dish that wasn't that bad.  Avoid glass noodles salad and cashew nut chicken, they were horrendous.  If I wasn't starving I wouldn't eat it at all.  Skip it guys! Unless you are starving to death!!!"}
{"text":"This is right below our building... the convenience factor is HUGE! HUGE! However... this is not remarkable in any way...its just passes as okay. The owners are pretty cool people. And their very fast. I have ordered upstair sin my condo..wlaked down 5 minutes later and the food is just coming out. My issues --- ive had better thai at Salad King, Mengrai, Koh San Road, Golden Thai and many other places...this is just the worst thai. If you arnt picky about your thai then this makes a quick and filling meal but dont expect authenticity. Meh."}
{"text":"Came with three friends. We didn't have to wait for seats so that was great.  We had the beef curry, the spicy ginger tofu, the vegetarian curry, and the hot and sour soup.   The food was delicious, not too spicy but still very flavorful.   The ambiance was great as well, check out the photos.   I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The owner was friendly. I'm glad I wasn't starving to death or had any other plans because we waited about 45 minutes to an hour for our food to arrived.  The food was \"eh\", nothing to write home about. I ate it anyway because I was really hungry. Came home and ate mixed popcorn to feed the rest of my hunger. Will I try this again? No."}
{"text":"Had the spicy chicken Pad thi, had 3 peppers on the menu, told them I wanted it hot and spicy. Got it and it was not spicy at all, had to get a side of hot sauce. Was a bit bland.  Not sure if I would go back price was OK"}
{"text":"Good selection of Thai food, decent service, cute atmosphere. Overall a good spot for lunch or dinner with small groups."}
