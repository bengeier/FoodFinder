{"text":"Great place for soups, they usually have 3 available with their won ton a homemade specialty. Sandwiches are made on the spot with their 'made on the premises' bread. They offer a small bowl of a daily salad to go with their lunch specials. Other options are available for a small additional cost. It's a friendly easygoing atmosphere. Lunch should cost you around $10.00 including tax.  Expect to see lots of locals, they are there frequently!"}
{"text":"This cute little cafe is a great place to meet for lunch. They have soups and sandwiches and they even make their own (yummy!) whole grain bread on site. In this day and age I'm surprised that these little cafes survive but I hope that the Den sticks around, it gives the neighbourhood more appeal!"}
{"text":"My wife and I go here quite a bit. Wonderful food and the owner ken is the nicest guy. You can also pick up homemade bread which is wonderful as well."}
{"text":"my favourite place for comfort grilled cheese on homemade flax bread"}
{"text":"The wonton soup is one of the best we've had.  My daughter will now eat only the Den's wonton.  Will often just drive by and get a couple to go.  Great selection of breads for breakfast toast.  Lattes are yummy.  Have been going there for years.... highly recommend!."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, because it's a mom-and-pop establishment and the owners seemed friendly. However, we did not have a good experience here. We ordered a grill cheese for the kids with a pasta salad for a side, and then my husband and I ordered a veggie panini and tried the won ton soup. The kids seemed to enjoy their grilled cheese (made with processed cheese - not what I'd anticipated), but my husband and I didn't think the soup was that good. There was also very little filling in our panini, but the food, albeit uninspired, was acceptable.  The kicker was that we had ordered two cartons of milk for our kids, one chocolate and one regular. The regular milk (with an expiry date two days in the future) had gone sour, and we unknowingly kept telling our toddler son to drink his milk even though he refused. We just figured he wasn't thirsty, until we brought home the untouched carton home and realized the contents had curdled. Even though it wasn't exactly the owner's fault that the milk had gone bad, based on our overall mediocre dining experience, we probably won't be back...sorry."}
{"text":"What an amazing little cafe! Really lovely food. Had a quiche and 3 different side salads: carrot/raisin, zucchini with pepper and yellow bell pepper, and celery root.  Everything is homemade and delicious. Decor is dinerish feel, but small and clean.  My favorite part was the sweet man who ran the place. He was so friendly and said that the food was delicious because it was made with love.  Sweet!"}
