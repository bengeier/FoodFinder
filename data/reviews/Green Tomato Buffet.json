{"text":"Why is everything fried???!?!?!?!??!?!?! I need a good vegan place that knows how to cook without frying everything. Please consider trying other methods other then frying."}
{"text":"Well, I heard about this buffet so I wen't.. Mind you, I am coming from a 3 hour drive from ATL and ''I am hungry\". The food was ok, I had better. But, the sweat ice tea was great. The soul food doesn't really taste like real southern food, but I guess it will do."}
{"text":"Ever wonder where that dive with the best Southern food is?  It's here at Green Tomato!  Best fried chicken and fresh vegetables.  Even though it's buffet, the food is always fresh.  You can't beat the price and there is always something quirky going on, like girls dancing after their recital or a random waitress singing karaoke.  You're guaranteed a great time and great food for a great price."}
{"text":"Everything was very good. The fried green tomatoes were a bit too greasy for me the meat loaf, fried chicken, mac n cheese, sweet potatoes were excellent

Service was great and friendly. Atmosphere leaves much to be desired. Went on a Tue evening and paid 6.99ea."}
{"text":"Disappointing. This place is run by Asians. The food is average \"buffet\" food. There is a good variety, but not all is good quality."}
{"text":"This place is far from grandma's cooking but it's decent and cheap if you're in the area.  The buffet is divided by meats, veggies/starches, salad bar, and desserts.  The food overall is below average to average with the dessert being the highlight. The service was great....if they put a little TLC into the food they will be on to something...."}
{"text":"The food in this place is GROSS.  I think to eat here, you must have no sense of taste.  Looking around - I think that could have been the case.  There were tons of old people eating here... and one guy with a tear drop tattoo.  What a mixed crowd.  Picture this:  Ponderosa, Florida, 4pm. 

The restaurant, from the looks of it, used to be a chinese buffet.  There are signs posted all over saying stuff like:  \"Keep costs down, don't waste... we're watching you.\"  

The food looked okay, but once I tasted it, it was pretty bad.  The meatloaf was sour - no spices, just straight up tomato paste.  Even the chocolate cake was horrible!  It tasted like they forgot to add the sugar and it was dry.  The banana pudding was soupy... and the bananas were brown.  I didn't find anything appetizing about this place.  I will not be back.  I would rather eat a smaller, better tasting meal.

If this is what people consider home cooking, I feel sorry for them."}
{"text":"Very good Southern food buffet.  The chicken was excellent and all of the veggies were delicious.  I had turkey with gravy and stuffing, fried chicken, baked chicken, fried pickles, fried green tomatoes, baked sweet potatoes with marshmallows, broccoli casserole, and mac and cheese.  Everything was good, no complaints.  Service was courteous and prompt.  Tables were clean, food area was clean and organized, price was less than $10 per person including a drink.  I went on a Wednesday, and each day they have different selections added for variety.  They are closed on Monday.  Highly recommended if you like that type of cuisine."}
{"text":"Place is now closed for business.  They have a sign on building saying it will be a hibachi buffet in the future."}
{"text":"The Green Tomato's food is like eating at your Grandma's house on Thanksgiving. It's high-quality, Southern fried good food. The macaroni and cheese is so good that it embarrasses me, and, while it is clearly a haven for meat eaters, there is an entire buffet line devoted to Southern style veggies. They manage to make the vegetables taste good without having chunks of pork floating in them, which I appreciate. There is also a full bar devoted to desserts, including banana pudding and peach cobbler. The prices are pretty good, too...it's less than $10 per person. 

There is a room with some larger tables that can accommodate bigger groups, too. It's a great place to go with a mixed group, because even the pickiest eaters can find SOMETHING to eat at a Southern joint (and as a vegetarian, I do speak on behalf of the picky eaters). 

The decor is a little lame, but it's a southern buffet, so you kind of expect it. There is something weird going on with cultural fusion, too...there are lots of Asian folks working there, and I have suspicions that it is Asian-owned...but the food is pure Southern Soul. I offer this observation of the cultural fusion not as a criticism, but as a point of interest. One night, there was even an Asian man singing pop songs at a keyboard, which added the most amazing, surreal ambiance to accompany my third plate of macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"Buffets aren't uncommon these days - they cater to people who don't want to wait, which as you know is also not uncommon in our world.  But the most common type of buffet is probably the Chinese Buffet.  Strangely, that variety of restaurant has the most trouble staying in business on the East Side of Charlotte - the China House (three times, once for relocation purposes) has gone out of business, as has the Super Buffet.

The King Buffet also folded, followed by the Jamaican restaurant Pop A Top, and I'm not sure if they even opened for business.  Now the Green Tomato has decided to open in its space.  Their theme?  Buffet.  But with a twist.  It's Southern Cooking - fried chicken, meatloaf, mac and cheese and of course fried green tomatoes.

I'm not really sure what took them so long to open the place, because the interior doesn't look that different from when King Buffet was there.  Maybe Pop A Top had done something and they had to clean it up.  But the place is light and airy, while well-staffed.  They kept glasses full to the point of almost overflowing.  Just take a sip and they will be there to top it off.

The food, while not outstanding, isn't bad - and since it's Southern-style, you probably won't go back for more than a plate or two.  This is likely a good choice for a buffet, as they aren't going to lose too many bets on people who like to pack it on, just because it's so heavy.  This isn't your gradnmother's cooking, but it isn't a horrible substitute.

You'll find a couple of buffet lines for the real food, as well as one for salads and one for desserts, so there are plenty of choices.  Each day has veggies and sides, while you get different specials for the day of the week (fish on Fridays, for instance).  Probably worth checking out if you like to get some Southern cooking and don't want to go through the trouble yourself."}
{"text":"Good Grandma like food.  Buffet and restaurant are clean.  Waitresses are attentive and quick with taking plates away and refills.  The only place this restaurant falters is the desserts.  The desserts are not good at all.  So if you have a sweet tooth save room and go somewhere else for that.  Fried chicken is finger licking good."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for lunch (7$ during the week, 8$ fri-sun) and was pretty impressed! A southern cooking buffet that has enough choices to please two vegetarians? Rare.

Started off with a mixed iceburg/romaine salad bar, complete with deviled eggs and a decent selection of fresh veggies. Blue cheese dressing was surprisingly tangy, if a little thin. From the hot food, we tried anything that looked promising: fried tomatoes, mashed taters, hush puppies, butter beans, mac n' cheese, cornbread. The mac n' cheese was very good, not super creamy, but tasty enough that I had to go back for seconds. Hush puppies were, of course, awesome.

This is not a place to go for a light lunch, but for the price and quality
 (They also do take out at $3.50 a pound, super cheap for the selection), it's pretty awesome. I'll be back, hopefully with time to take a nap afterwards.

Note: they're closed on Monday, and are open 11-8:30 the rest of the week."}
