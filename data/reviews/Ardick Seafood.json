{"text":"Great spot to grab lunch and on a nice day sit outside on their covered patio.  Tartar sauce was amazing and different from anything else."}
{"text":"Great seafood. I had a Lake Walleye Dinner and hubby had the perch sandwich. We also had the lobster bisque. The food was all great. Can't wait to stop by again. Fresh seafood prices are very reasonable. No in store dining but the food is so good I'd eat in the car. A great Mom and Pop that is a hidden little jewel."}
{"text":"I consistently stop in for the perch dinner and a 1/4 pound of clam strips atleast once a month. Fresh fish. Great service. They also make great bbq. Hidden gem on a dead part of lorain"}
{"text":"Nice staff and awesome food.  No indoor seating but picnic table area was nice to eat outside.  Lobster bisque was delish with lots of lobster.  Cabbage and noodles tasted homemade.  Gave free taste of smoked salmon which my husband subsequently ordered and enjoyed.  Fresh fried lake perch was also fantastic.  Will definitely come back.   We wish we would have found sooner!"}
{"text":"This is the place for local fresh seafood if your in Lorain! They also have cooked meals as well! LAKE ERIE PERCH!!!!! I miss it! So when I come home I have to get me some perch and walleye!!!!"}
{"text":"I have driven past this place a bunch of times and finally stopped last Friday.  I gotta say this place has the best yellow perch sandwich....I wish I would had stopped here a long time ago!  The sandwich is about $5 and definitely worth every penny of it!    They offer fresh seafood and carry out meals.  I have heard the lobster bisque is very good so I'll be stopping by for it next time!   It's nice to have a good place for seafood and great carryout food near work (Lorain, there isn't much of anything around here for food), I will continue to give my business to a great place like this!"}
{"text":"We were frequent customers when we lived in Lorain. Now we drive from Medina for the wonderful seafood cooked or uncooked. Killer smoked salmon, great owners. It doesn't get any better. Seriously well worth the drive. No fresher seafood anywhere."}
{"text":"We have a traditional large clam bake each year in October. In the past, we have ordered the middle neck clams from a variety of places and have just been partially satisfied. This year's clams came from Ardick Seafood and were the absolute best we have ever had! They were clean and nice size. The price was the same as the other places but the quality surpassed all! We no longer will be searching for our future clam bakes! Thanks Ardick Seafood!!! Everyone raved about this year's clams!!"}
{"text":"A nice little restaurant/fish market. The food was pretty good and they had a great looking counter of fresh fish. Ardick Seafood seems like a good place for lunch and has a nice menu of seafood stuff to choose from. Ardick Seafood is better for carry out meals. There is no place to eat inside, but they do have picnic tables set up under and awning/tent so if you eat there make sure to go when it's nice out.    I've only been here once, and if it wasn't so far away from home I definitely would make return trips there."}
{"text":"I love their fish but it is way over priced.  To get a decent dinner you are talking almost $20.00, that's crazy from a smelly fish market where you have to eat outside."}
{"text":"The perch dinner is an excellent value! Didn't realize at first that they sold fish dinners. I grew tired of the Slovak Home's overpriced, overhyped and sub-par fish.     If you want the best perch in town, you must come here!"}
{"text":"This is a difficult review for me to write about this quaint seafood store and take out restaurant.  I might have hit it on a bad day, or perhaps the fryer was not totally up to temperature when I arrived.    I snagged the perch dinner and onion rings based on the recommendations here.  The batter was average \"fast food\" type batter, and did not present a unique characteristic.  I found the onion rings ok, and very oiled. (From the container near the fryers, it looks like soybean oil.) Hoping the cole slaw and tarter sauce would take it over the top, I sampled them and found the tarter tasting like a commercial blend.  I did not find any unique flavor over tones in either the tarter sauce or the cole slaw.  I found the staff very pleasant and helpful.  If you need to snag a quick fried fish lunch on a nice day, Ardick would fit the bill.  Eating under the canopy on the picnic tables is pleasant on a nice fall day.  Surveying the case, the fish presented for sale looked very good."}
{"text":"Apparently this place has been around for 20+ years, but just recently discovered it! The fish market has fresh seafood selections, and they also have a take-out menu of sandwiches, fried fish platters, etc. The only prepared food I've tried so far is the lobster bisque, which is Deeeevine! Lots of chunks of lobster and has a wonderful fresh flavor and no unpleasant \"fishiness\" like store-bought lobster bisque."}
