{"text":"We had dinner at this place . we ordered Chicken Fingers & Louisiana Chicken.  Both items served hot and were good. There are few noticeable things -  1. Plates were not properly cleaned, we had to cleaned them by self. 2. Lady who took our order was helpful and suggested both items. 3. Cleanness of place was not upto the mark, there were flies around us.  4. Chicken fingers quantity was more then enough for two. 5. Louisiana Chicken was nice and tasty and 1 order is enough for 2."}
{"text":"Ive been here several times in the past few years and the service and food are going down hill. Its took way to long to get a burger and fries,about 25 minutes, when only 2 other tables had customers and the burger was terrible."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast, and ordered the spinach omelet. It arrived quickly, was warm and was giant, as were the helping of home fries with it. All was delicious, service was quick and attentive (but not annoying), coffee was full and warm and an overall enjoyable business breakfast."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, friendly waitresses, friendly owner. Good prices. Best Chicken parm and fettuccini and their cake is best in the state."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. You can't beat the weekday special for value. Friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Small locally owned business.  The food is always hot & fresh!  Excellent service and good portion size.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Classic American Diner. Food was good, especially for the price. Had the Greek Salad and Southwestern Panini. Also had a side of onion rings. Service was attentive and food was served quickly.   Indoor decor is straight from the 70s, and the checks are hand written, but the food is good."}
{"text":"No place like Bagley's Grill in the city! Love comforting, affordable, quick eats. Definitely a Greek diner, definitely owner operated and definitely delicious. I came in, thanks to yelp, and loved this place.  As soon as I walked in, I noticed that the place was quite busy, always a great sign. Also, this was an exceptionally clean diner. The menu has a few too many items, but I am really picky about this, it's too hard for me to choose when there is more than a one page menu. They had wraps, salads, burgers, gyro's, sandwiches, salmon and steak dinners, everything under the sun.  We tried the avgolemono soup (Greek lemon soup with veggies and chicken), wow, this was done right! The stuffed pepper soup tasted just like it should. The bread was fresh, warm and had a great chew.   We both decided to order specials for our entrees. My friend went with the salisbury steak, and I, the chicken paprikash. The salisbury steak is cravable, mouth watering, greatness on a plate--you must try. I am a huge critic of chicken paprikash, there is only one restaurant that has ever served me a delicious paprikash. Every other time I have ordered this, I have found the dish inedible. This was true for this restaurant as well. However, once sent back, I had a fresh plate of salisbury steak within minutes. Great work!  Our server did a great job, I can be a little much for a diner and she was totally cool about it. I was very happy with this place, I cannot wait to come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, good prices, great homemade food. Much love to the Gyro Omelet!"}
{"text":"I've only visited for breakfast, but where else in the city--or, erm, state of Ohio-- can you get a whole breakfast for $2 or $3? On weekdays, you can get two eggs, hashbrowns and toast for $2. If you want ham, sausage or bacon, add another buck. You just can't beat it! And it's really tasty and freshly-made, too.   The staff has always been friendly, the owner is always present and the service is fast. I've never had their cakes or desserts, but they always beckon me from their cases, looking super delicious and sinful. Perhaps someday I'll cave. They look so good!"}
{"text":"The review would be better, but the last time we were here the hostess decided to seat some regulars before us, even though we were waiting for 15 min. Needless to say, we left and went to Robert Evan's down the street. That is a cardinal sin and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Italian wedding soup and stuffed pepper soups were delicious. Definitely a great place for dinner. Nice people."}
{"text":"The food is awesome but the service was even better. I was greeted at the door with a smile! The spinach omelette is beyond good! Home fries are great too. I will definitely come back again when I'm in town for business!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Very good breakfast food and really nice staff."}
{"text":"6 guys couldn't agree, so we ended up here... and I'm GLAD we did!!  Typical diner, reminded me of a greasy spoon that I never heard of. But the menu presented me with a dilemma.. lotsa things I wanted to try. So after asking the server's recommendations, I went off-script & proposed adding Pastrami to one of their Burgers. She checked w/ chef and said sure, just a dollar extra!  BOY was that the best buck I ever spent!  Then after we order, they bring out complimentary Breaded Mushrooms.. wow! We all gobbled those up.  Everyone's food came out perfect, 1/2# Burgers were huge, and my creation was scrumtitlyumptious!  Prices were inexpensive, Servers were fun, Chef Bagley came out to chitchat.. good times!!"}
{"text":"They have great food and great prices. The owner is really nice and he makes sure to say hello to everyone that walks through the door. The only reason I'm not 100% satisfied with this place is because of the servers. They seem to favorite regulars. They were constantly checking on the tables that had the regular customers, but we were not offered a refill or any thing through the whole dinner. The servers just do not seem happy to serve anyone other than customers they already know. It's makes the experience a little uncomfortable. If it wasn't for the food being good and reasonably priced and the owner being so nice, I don't think we would come back here again."}
{"text":"I like this place. we order lunch carry out from it sometimes. corn beef is good  Gyro is also good, Reuben,Meatloaf"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly and fast service, great prices, and delicious food. Went for breakfast on a Sunday morning with family and everyone left full and happy. Nice atmosphere and family run feel. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This recent was close and recommended by the staff at A Christmas Tree house.  Holy moly I was delicious."}
{"text":"An Oasis of Breakfast in a sea of chains...  During a recent stay in Cleveland we wanted to get a good hearty breakfast and wanted to avoid chain restaurants-- after a good half hour of driving we came upon this place.  Great breakfast specials including a deal for two eggs, toast, homefries and coffee for only $2!  I added Turkey Sausage to mine and our total bill was less than $9.    The homefries are among the best I've ever had-- no grease-- almost like thick cut potato chips and everything else was exactly to order.  The staff was extremely friendly and the coffee kept coming.    Decor wise this was a nice place-- definitely not your average breakfast spot-- or at least not what I'm used to in the Northeast.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to grab a quick breakfast before my trip back home to Louisville KY and I'm sure glad I did. I had the Greek omelet omg it is so yummy. Thanks yelp peeps for the reviews! Their coffee was hot and extra tasty too. Atmosphere and our waitress was great. I'm all set and ready for the road. :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Everything was great! The wait staff the food and the atmosphere.    It was reasonably priced and they had a good variety of food choices.   It's what you want a family restaurant to be."}
{"text":"Every one needs a small go to place, this would be it. Fantastically friendly staff, great food.  The owner is a blast to talk to. Try anything it's all good."}
{"text":"Good comfort food.  Great prices.  And the owner is always very friendly and welcoming.  The type of neighborhood restaurant everyone wants to have near them.  The food here is about as expensive as a drive through McD's, but McD's comes without someone calling you 'Hon' while they bring you a plate full of hashbrowns and perfectly cooked eggs."}
{"text":"Just visiting town and was quite impressed with the other reviews. The place got off to a decent start with some tasty soups and loaf of bread with plenty of real butter. My wife ordered the ribeye, a Sizzler-style cut, very thin and it could be generously described as marbled. More scrappy than marbled, though. I ordered the Cheese Crusted Chicken, which was quite tasty. The real downfall was served on the side. Under the appetizer section, they tempt you with skins \"stuffed with cheddar and provolone cheeses, green onions and bacon bits, served with sour cream.\" So, these people obviously know what belongs on a potato. It ain't on the baker, Bub! Buttery flavored substance and sour creamishness are all you get with that spud. And the veggies? Peas and carrots straight from a gallon can marked \"Peas & Carrots.\" No attempt to season or dress them, or offer any actual green vegetable. All-in-all, not bad, but not so good."}
{"text":"Great for a quick breakfast. Prices are great and food is good. Small seating area with attentive service. Menu is small but all the classics are there for a good meal."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Middleburg hts. Peggy & I had dinner there last night. Excelent food & reasonal prices. We will go back, often."}
{"text":"Bagley's Grill is a go-to for me because of the great service, great food, and atmosphere. My favorite thing there is the breakfast menu. It is delicious. The lunch and dinner menu is amazing as well. I went last night, and i ordered a burger with some changes, and they were patient and nice. They were also very patient with my 4 year old brother who was taking his time. They also have great variety in their menu for all ages. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place! My go too breakfast spot. Staff is mostly friendly and I'm never disappointed by the service. Breakfast is always out fast and wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with my family, pretty cheap and absolutely delicious! A hidden treasure of Berea for sure!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, friendly staff.  Breakfast was delicious and fast.   We'll be back many more times"}
{"text":"A family member recommended we meet at Bagley's Grill.  I'd never been, and never heard of it, so I was game to try it.  I've now eaten there twice, and each time was great.  The staff is wonderful.  Best waitstaff ever.  Seriously.  Both gals were at the top of their game during a busy dinner rush (6pm-7pm)  Both visits the salad starter has been super fresh with a nice mix of veggies.  Sliced baguette & real butter, too.  The portion sizes of the entrees are large.  I always take half my meal home and eat it for another meal or two.  Because of that I feel it's a good value  =)  Though my table mates always eat everything on their plate, taking nothing with them, so I guess that proves they really enjoyed their choices too  =)  If you enjoy couponing, there have been coupons in local publications, so keep an eye out for one of those and give Bagley's Grill a try."}
{"text":"Great place for fresh food. Have always loved this place but haven't been in area for a while. Went there today and just as good as always has been. Owner Demetri is such a nice host. Place is clean and food always delicious."}
{"text":"Bagley's Grill is a  solid choice for good food and large portions at a reasonable price.  We have tried the breakfast a few times and now tried lunch.  I ordered the portobello mushroom salad.  It was huge and LOADED with artichokes and mushrooms atop of mixed greens.  I added salmon to the salad and was impressed with that as well.  My dining partners had burgers and fries. Burgers were huge and juicy judging by the drippings left on the plate when they were done.  Great place for kids too.  After being seated, our server offered crackers and brought a cup of crayons and a coloring book to entertain the little one.  Kid's meal was great.  Nice size plate of pasta with meatballs and 2 slices of garlic bread. The only thing I would skip are the french fries.  Seemed like frozen, out of a bag and they were not brown or crispy.  Could have just been that day though."}
