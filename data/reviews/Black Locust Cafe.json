{"text":"The food was very tasty and the owner was welcoming and very friendly. We had the Avocado toast which at first glance may not have been my favorite but it was quite delicious. The miso bowl was fresh, yummy and healthy  and the Bings were even better. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Biked over because the check-in deal said 50 cent beers. And the beer *was* delicious, but the jian bing? Egg, scallion, chili, soy, cilantro, soy sauce, and wonton (the perfect addition). So, so, SO satisfying. Next time, I'll try the v-bing and sub the pork crackling for the wonton as one employee recommended. Great people here and a beautiful courtyard to boot."}
{"text":"Really good food and excellent service. We loved Julep and the courtyard so hopefully the new concept is a success. Black Locust is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"From out of town and stumbled on this place before shopping at Festival. Superb coffee, friendly staff, delicious quinoa tofu salad and avocado toast."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Friendly service. The whole menu is rock solid. Not too busy. Plus they have a bank safe door. That's pretty cool."}
{"text":"I have been going to Black Locust Cafe for the past year. Every time it is better and better. Everything I have ordered is delicious and the service and ambiance is warm and welcoming. I highly recommend it for breakfast and lunch. In addition they have added Madison on Tap and Jardin. Madison on Tap is a great hang out bar also with comfortable seating and nice lighting and every month they highlight a new local brewery's beer.I love the place. I had dinner at Jardin recently and the food was delicious!! I don't know what else I can say, this place has everything and is in a great neighborhood , and they have a beautiful courtyard for outdoor seating!! This place is it! Great for a wedding or big party. Spread the word!"}
{"text":"Was in Madison to visit our son who wanted to try this place.  My wife and I each had the Basic B which was delicious while our son tried the Farro Porridge Bowl.  Lots of flavors.   Top top it of, we split a Nutella and banana crepe which was also great.  The wait staff were wonderful!  Would go back"}
{"text":"Pluses: Good and unique vegan options. Nice staff and usually extremely quick service.

Room to Improve: Outdoor seating in the Robinia Courtyard would be nice but the tables are always filthy and there are overstuffed ashtrays everywhere at brunch time.  Ugh.  They seem to have put their umbrellas away for the year and it can be blindingly sunny outside, too.  Skip the coffee choices; not sure what beans they use but we've never liked any coffee or espresso drink here.  There's much better coffee across the street in the 700 block of E. Wash so we usually go for coffee before going to Black Locust."}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary in Madison. Random surprise walk in and was extremely satisfied by the service and quality of drinks."}
{"text":"I was in the vicinity during the week midday and decided to give Black Locust a second chance after having a pretty bad experience my first time (as in waited an hour and a half for food). However, this place has truly redeemed itself in my eyes. 

First off, the vibes are quintessentially Madison with plants lining the windows and Indie folk music humming in the background. 

I ordered a Jian Bing and a cup of coffee. For $5, the Jian Bing is a light yet filling meal. It comes out piping out is a beautiful blend of crunchiness, sweet, and savory. I could eat variations of this for every meal. It's a good amount of food that seems right for the price. 

Black Locust is a great place to perch out for a cup of coffee and yummy food, whether you're here to catch up with an old friend or to buckle down and do some work. Post lunch hours are the way to go if you want to avoid crowds and longer wait times!"}
{"text":"We read someplace this was popular with locals. So, being locals we'd give it a shot.  Bad idea. Very, very bad idea.  I ordered the Danny Boy, eggs over hard. My companion chose the quinoa bowl. I requested egg be over hard.  When I got the food, egg was over well. I sent the eggs back, the food runner left the hash browns and corned beef. The potatoes were warmish, as was the hash on top. My companion's food was one step below warm.  Eggs come over well, again.  Od had enough,  so I had to go see who was in the kitchen.  I showed the young man how to properly cook an egg over hard.  When I have to show someone how to cook, this isn't the place fir me. I don't have to tell you, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great food (including vegetarian) and drink options (real fresh squeezed OJ and kombucha) prepared with quality ingredients, seasoned well, and at very reasonable prices! The only thing not to love is that it will probably become too popular soon and it will be hard to get a table. Will come back next week to try their chicken and waffles special."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome.  Handled our large group with ease.  Food came out steaming hot and fresh.  All orders were taken in a quick manner and accurately.  Loved that our orders were hand delivered by the owner.  He personally made our experience worth it.  Must try when you come to Madison."}
{"text":"Strolled in at just the right moment before their kitchen closed at 3 to get a taste of their crepes. I opted for the Jian Bing crepe: egg, scallion, black bean sauce, cilantro, soy, wonton. Super savory and crunchy!  Not a huge portion, good for a light meal. I paired it with a matcha tea to balance out the bold flavoring of the Jian Bing. 

The first time walking into Robinia Courtyard is a little confusing, because it's a shared space with 3 businesses. Black Locust is the first pit stop along the way. Ill have to come back when the weather's a little nicer to check out the shared courtyard to get the full effect of this space. 

Overall, it's a really cute coffee shop, sunny (although the back area vault seating was a little dim for me), plants scattered around, smiling baristas, plenty of workspace nooks. And it also doubles as an monthly art venue space!"}
{"text":"I feel like I found a hidden gem! 
I was a little confused when I tried to find the Black Locust, and I drove past it once. Then once I parked, I was confused about where to go in, do I sit down, or do I order? Are all of these restaurants connected? I still don't know the answer to those questions, and I don't even care because there is so much character in this little Robinia Courtyard. 
We ordered at the counter of Black Locust, then took our # to a table outside. The server came and delivered half of our order, but took the number off the table, so when someone else tried to bring us the second half of the order she was also confused. I'm not sure why they didn't wait until the order was complete to bring everything.  Again, I did not even care because this courtyard is seriously cute. 
We ordered the lemon curd and blackberry crepe, the Danny Boy, and the Farrow Porridge Bowl.  The crepe was absolute heaven. No other words could describe it. The Danny Boy and Porridge Bowl were also delicious. They did lack seasoning, so we had to add our own. Finding salt and pepper was also an adventure, and they really had NO seasoning WHATSOEVER, so it was necessary. All of the ingredients tasted fresh, and the flavors meddling together so well, especially in the Porridge Bowl. 
We loved this place. Despite the confusion and lack of seasoning, I'm tempted to give it 5 stars. However, it was definitely a learning experience, the service was non-existent (but maybe there isn't supposed to be any?), but I'm interested to go back and try some booze."}
{"text":"Incredible food, fantastic back patio, great service. Jewel of a find, will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem. Any place with their own house made hot sauce is a winner to me. Great coffee, great food, and very affordable. The employees there are really friendly and give great recommendations."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early lunch on a Saturday afternoon and parked our bikes in the patio area. Headed into the bar to order and experienced great customer service. My wife and I both ordered the mystery beer and the Jing Bing and headed outside. Madison restaurants earn my respect for good outdoor seating and this place is a winner. Food portions were not large but great flavors and good value. We split the Nutella and banana crepe for dessert. We hope to be back again soon."}
{"text":"Enjoying another stellar crêpe here at the Black Locust Café. If you haven't treated yourself to one of these yet, highly recommend them. The Jian Bing (Chinese street-food crêpe) and a coffee may be one of the best and most delicious breakfast deals in town, certainly the most Bing for Your Buck :) $5 actually. A steal. The fact that it's the same for dinner is great. Having a Cuban crêpe with a beer at the moment. Bravo, Black Locust team."}
{"text":"Amazing Soy iced latte with honey ... this is my jam and they do it so well! Not all lattes are created equal. I have had this drink made by two different baristas and the consistency was impressive. The breakfast was good but a bit more costly than what I'd usually spend. One latte and two breakfasts was almost $30. My husband didn't get a coffee because I was paying and he didn't want to break the bank. Know that the food is good but you may pay a bit more than the average breakfast place. I got the crepes, and they were good but I wished they had an old reliable waffle, pancake or French toast option as well."}
{"text":"Service:  1 Where to begin.. When we first arrived, we were not really greeted.  I asked the staff member at the counter (we'll call her rainbow kitty because she had a rainbow WI shirt on and she actually meow'd at me lol) how much sugar was in their kombucha drink.  She reacted as if I asked her why the sky was blue and said she didn't know.  Fine, no big deal.  We proceeded to order our food, paid, and yada yada.  Never a smile or a thank you or anything.

We sat outside in the courtyard which was fairly nice.  Our food took quite some time almost to the point where we would have walked out if we hadn't already paid for it.  Finally, it came and my wife needed a refill on her coffee.  We were told that you had to go back inside for a refill.  Seriously?  So I walked back inside and asked her for a refill but now had to wait for a new pot to brew which took a few minutes.  Keep in mind, my food is outside sitting on the table.  Here's a crazy idea, maybe say \"I'll bring it to you when it's ready\" so I can start eating my food?  Nope.  Too much work I suppose.  Then, Rainbow Kitty noticed me standing there and quips \"Do you need something?\" I said \"Yes, I'm waiting for coffee,\" as she already started walking away without responding.  Yikes 

Finally got the refill and went back to eat my food which was fairly cold now.  They also expect you to bus your own table in which due to the poor service we did not participate in.

To sum it up, service was non-existent at best and hostile at worst.  

Food: 3 I am being generous here.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy dish (I don't remember the name).  It was cold and not the worst I've ever had.  Probably would have been better if I was able to eat it right away instead of waiting for coffee.

Ambience: 3 It definitely has a hipster vibe.  If you don't fit the mold, you may feel out of place.

Absolutely will not be dining at this establishment again anytime soon.  Service is king, especially in the restaurant industry, and without it you won't be around long.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Good quick meal.
The toasts are good and as are the crepes.
Had a bloody mary with my breakfast which was great.
Parking is a challenge, but not the fault of this place.
Also cool, an old vault that is part of the cafe..."}
{"text":"I came upon this new (to me) restaurant by searching \"cafes\" on Yelp! I had no idea it had been A OK Coffee, prior to this. What drew me in, was: I remembered that this building housed a furrier in days past. And I believe the safe where the furs were kept, is still right there in the restaurant.
I love breakfast, so I was happy to see this cafe listed as breakfast & brunch. But I was just a pleased to see it serves bings until 3 pm and beer and liquor until 9- all at reasonable prices-tap beer and wine for $5. There is even a mystery beer for $2. The atmosphere is laid back and yes, cute, with a small bar and tables with chairs and benches.
I ordered the Farro Porridge + Mushrooms + Roasted Squash + Apple + Hickory Nut, with Fried Egg on top. It was delicious and filling. I can't wait to try the Hippie Fritatta next. The menu is varied enough, that everyone should find something to their liking-such as the Nutella crepe, or the buttermilk biscuits and gravy. Yum.
I discovered that you order and pay at the register, or bar, sit down and the food is brought out to you. I had a $2.75 flat white coffee which was on the strong side, but it was good, although in a smaller cup. I was nearly finished with it when my food came. They have all kinds of Rishi tea at $3.
I am not sure if there is a parking lot around back, but I found a parking spot on the side of the building after 1 PM on a week day. Since I did not know this restaurant was there, I have never looked to see how busy it is on the weekends. But I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The bings are packed with delicious ingredients...layers of flavors and texture!  I had the jian-bing and my friend had the cu-bing! Satisfying Filling Deliciousness! Check out their patio! Awesome place awesome food & libations awesome crew!"}
{"text":"I was much more impressed my second time visiting this cafe. My first experience for brunch was very shortly after they opened and I felt pretty meh. It wasn't bad but I wasn't particularly impressed with the food given the price point. For the next year, I kept getting popups from Yelp saying \"Brunch places near you!\" with Block Locust always at the top, and very well rated. I decided a year was long enough and gave in to the constant marketing. My second visit for brunch was during a Saturday farmers market so the line to order was pretty long. The order experience is very much like Short Stack Eatery. You wait in line to order - order - find a seat - wait for food.
Even though it was really busy, the atmosphere was still comfortable and cozy. It was relatively quiet, though we were in a little room surrounded mostly by students who were studying. It's a super chill place I could definitely hang out for hours.
I landed with the Baked Hippie which is a frittata with seasonal vegetables and my sister ordered the basic breakfast. I was a big fan of my dish. Oftentimes I'm weary of egg bakes / scrambled eggs / frittatas because a lot of restaurants tend to overcook them. This dish was perfect, and the vegetables were spot on as well. The price for my meal was pretty solid.
My sister was less enthused, and I'm fairly certain she ordered the dish I had a year ago. Her meal was fine but kind of meh, but with a \"basic breakfast\" you can't really expect too many frills.
I'd go again to try other dishes, or just grab some coffee. I probably wouldn't become a regular though."}
{"text":"I really like coming to this place. It was a little hard for me to find at first, since there's not like a big sign outside of the cafe that says Black Locust Cafe - just use your GPS the first time you come here. The servers are really cool and nice; I also appreciate the spacious area of the cafe as well."}
{"text":"Love coming here to work in the afternoons. From 3-6pm they have happy hour which includes $1.50 espressos and $2 kombuchas. Staff is pretty chill and friendly They also have beer on tap for $2 and $3 dollars. Usually not too many people and pretty enjoyable music. There is bike parking right in front which is a big plus.

The only reason that it isn't 5 stars is because food orders took a long time both times I've ordered food here. The Jian Bing is a decent go to for a light snack or meal."}
{"text":"I kinda don't want to even review this place because then you'll all go there and we'll have to wait for a table next time and you'll just ruin it. But hey, sharing is caring, right, so I'll say: this place is a lovely little gem. Sunlight main dining room; creative, fresh, avocado-loaded toast; and a really yummy and plentiful corned beef hash. I even tried the \"mystery beer\" (and I hate surprises) and appreciate their commitment to the mystery - the servers didn't even know what the beer was, so no hints. I will say, The Husband's grits had hardly any andouille sausage on them (especially compared to how much awesome corned beef I got in my hash), but the rice grits were otherwise cheesy & flavorful, and my hash browns were super tasty. We'll def go back."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their weekend brunch. I always get the basic breakfast with saussage and a cappuccino. The biscuits are fantastic. In the summer you can sit out back in the courtyard which is quite pretty. I've been here many times and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"This is an interesting spot on East Washington Ave. They've changed names (perhaps in the last year) from A-OK to Black Locust. Honestly liked the place better when it was A-OK, the coffee they used from Kin Kin was very good. Since the switch to True the quality has gone down. I'm probably not their typical customer - rarely ordered food beyond a pastry or cookie - and drank a lot of coffee. So I can't comment on the food there."}
{"text":"Stopped by Black Locust to check out the changes they have made since it was A OK Coffee. The answer? Esthetically, almost nothing. They have yet to even paint over the old menu on the wall. That being said, the environment is very clean and crisp. 

I arrived around 3:30 pm and was disappointed to learn they were only serving Bings at that point (no bowls, toast, eggs, or crepes!) This was a big bummer for me as I was looking forward to trying the crepes. Also, I'm not sure how much more challenging it would be to continue to serve crepes since the bings are essentially crepe sandwiches. Anyhow, I digress...

I ordered the Cu-bing and it arrived and was tasty, but nothing life changing. The experience was cheapened by the disposable paper and plastic basket presentation. I ordered the $1 donut from the bakery and that was good. 

Bottomline: I'll be back again to try the crepes."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite breakfast and brunch spot in Madison. The quinoa bowl was lovely and had a great taste to it. Usually quinoa can be so bland, but this was pretty great. The presentation is beautiful and the service is pretty casual and receptive. It's a comfortable atmosphere and makes for a really nice place to drink tea and read or go on a nice date with your person. Will be back. xoxo 

I also recommend their matcha tea. So good."}
{"text":"I really was torn between 4 or 5 stars for this place, and I'd really give it a 4.5. The only reason I'd give it less than 5 is for speed when ordering food. You order at the counter and food is brought to you at your table. It's a bit slow, but not really a huge deal when I'm the only one there because the food is delicious and prepared fresh, so a bit of a wait is often times worth it (but maybe don't try to get it to go when you need to get to work...). However, I went on a particularly busy weekday morning one time, and we stood in line forever just to order, then waited at our table forever to get the food. And the food didn't actually come out as ordered. They did fix the order, but the entire meal was just LONG. I'm really glad that they kept a lot of the atmosphere and menu of A-OK. I wish they served breakfast BEFORE 8am, since most people are already at work or don't have time to START breakfast at 8am, but oh well. The one bad thing that held over from A-OK.

That said, I love the breakfast here. I've only ever come for breakfast, but I come often (I just have to make sure I have time) for both take-out and dine-in. Staff is always super friendly, and I love that they have coffee, kombucha, beer, and wine (and I believe some liquors too). I work nights so getting my mimosa fix in the AM with breakfast is great, though I'm always loathe to spend $8 on a champagne flute mimosa. The food is freshly cooked and delicious. Scrambled eggs are never dry, potatoes are awesome and have great seasoning, and the biscuits are to die for. I go out for breakfast like most people go out for dinner, and this is definitely one of my favorite breakfasts. They also have a pretty diverse menu for varied hunger levels and dietary preferences."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out as I had been to the southern style restaurant next door (Julep) and they sent me a mailer with a nice discount. Better yet, they also had a yelp offer for cheap beers . We ended up sitting outside on the patio in the Julep section and only went inside of Black Locust to get the beers. It was close to closing time and the bar tender/barista was extremely rude to me. In contrast the folks at Julep were amazingly nice and kept coming outside to visit with my dogs and feed them treats."}
{"text":"Very cool space, with friendly staff.  The menu is unique and both the food and drink are very affordable compared to other cafes in the area.  We tried the Jian Bing, which is surprising and really great, and the corned beef hash.  The corned beef has was good, but it wasn't corned beef -- it was just cubed steak which was disappointing since that's not really what one thinks of when they hear \"corned beef\".  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast and adorable courtyard. Quirky and professional staff. How are there not more people here?!"}
{"text":"Probably the best hidden gem in Madison. An awesome place to come for breakfast and a great place to hang out and work.

I have eaten just about the entire menu and loved all of it. My personal favorites are the bings, especially the Cuban and Jian bing. 

Great atmosphere and cool interior. Big plus is the ability to eat in the Robinia Courtyard which is beautiful. Excellent service! I come here just about every week and I don't see that changing anytime soon!"}
{"text":"The Heritage Grits were amazing and very filling.  The coffee was strong and good, the one downfall was the biscuits it was hard and dry, maybe just a bad day for biscuits because everything else was good along with very friendly staff.  I will absolutely be stopping in again when in town if I'm able."}
{"text":"The place has a nice vibe and the menu looks really interesting, but I found the actual food a bit disappointing and bland.

I had the grits, husband had the Loren crepe and little one had the frittata of the day. The grits was ok once I added a bit of hot sauce and mixed it up, nothing exceptional but satisfying enough. The vegetables in the frittata were way undercooked and again on the bland side. Husband I think had the best dish.

Might or might not be back. If I do I will not order the frittata again."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, food and even better service. Enjoyed a lovely Sunday morning at this trendy cafe. The smoked ham and fried egg toast is a must! Will definitely return on my next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and spent the weekend in Madison and stumbled across the nicest cafe!  I liked the vibe so much that I stayed for brunch.  The food was great and recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot.  It's beautiful, has a variety of seating, $5 crepes that are the best I've ever had, and a gorgeous stone patio.  Con: sassy staff."}
{"text":"Tried this out after hearing about it.  I had the basic B with sausage and a chai latte.  My boyfriend ordered Southern Gent(biscuits and gravy with 2eggs).  Basic B was ok.  I didn't receive my Chai latte until most of my meal was consumed. I mentioned to the person who delivered it and their reply was that there were many people that came in after we placed our order.  So I am not understanding how that is my issue - that they got busy. The biscuit in the southern gent was dry and  very hard to cut with a butter  knife.  Lacked seasoning.and savoriness. We had to search out the salt and pepper. Coffee is ok.  This was not worth $28."}
{"text":"We popped in for breakfast and a coffee. I got a latte and my boyfriend got a coffee, both were good. We decided to order food and decided on a crepe wrap and biscuits and gravy. My crepe wrap was delicious but my boyfriends meal on the other hand was not so good. He said the biscuits were hard and difficult the chew, the gravy tasted old, and the food was a little cold. The man who waited on us seemed unenthusiastic about having to be at work and didn't really speak to us. Overall we were kind of disappointed."}
{"text":"I went there twice, and both times the food and coffee were delicious and on the point. The service was impeccable! Their crepe sandwich is a much try! Also, love their mystery beer concept."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely in love with the idea of a healthy happy hour. I can get Kombucha for $2 on a hot day, and I adore that. The bartenders are always really sweet/kind."}
{"text":"This place is so cute. I love it. I love the sunlight streaming through the windows, the exposed brick, the wood benches, and all the plants. I would want this place to be my loft! 

We came here for brunch. We grabbed menus and seats first and made our selections before ordering at the bar. The silverware and self serve water are up by the bar as well. The day that we were here, they were out of much of their regular menu including their bowls and toasts. I'm not an omelette person so that usually rules out a lot of the brunch menus for me, but thankfully there was still plenty of options. 

We ordered a lemon curd and blackberry jam crepe, which was okay. I think I'm not a fan of sweet crepes. We also ordered a jian bing, which is a thin crepe like wrap wrapped around savory asian fillings, including egg, cilantro, black bean sauce, and wonton. This was quite delicious, and I was a big fan of their jian bing. It had crispy bits and was well balanced in flavor. Overall, it was a really nice take on the traditional jian bing and the egg helped it feel breakfasty. I would definitely come back for their bings and I highly recommend that you try a couple of them too. 

Service was friendly and very accommodating. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Suuuuuper tasty coffee, delicious vegetarian crepe (to which I added an egg, perfectly cooked by the kitchen), friendly service, comfy and varied seating options, and wifi for dayyyys. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Went for brunch because it has such a good review on yelp. A little bit disappointed because I thought everything must be amazing and perfect. 

First impression: Very hip and trendy place. I love the seating next to the big windows. 

Food: I couldn't figure out what kind of cuisine they are serving. There are Asian, Southern American, French, British, etc. dishes. So if you are with a diverse group, this place a thing for everyone. I had the Southern gent which is 2 eggs, grit and sausage over French toast (it was supposed to be biscuit but they ran out). The food was not as amazing as I thought it would be. I would say the dish was just average. I also tried the lemon curd and black berry jam crepe. Again, average dish. Nothing so special that made me go \"yummm\" 

Drink: They do serve alcohol but I went for hot drinks instead. I absolutely love the maple latte which I would give a 5 star rating. The coffee was good but the maple flavor and taste made it perfect for me. I also tried the matcha latte and it was okay. 

Convenience: Again, great place for hanging out, working, relaxing, etc. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. A lot of outlets so I stay there working on my laptop for a while. I didn't explore the outdoor seating because it was too hot for me but I bet it must be lovely at night"}
{"text":"Visited the cafe for a late breakfast. Enjoyed the large plate of eggs, potatoes, sausage and biscuit the size of my head! Along with delicious coffee and muffin. My boyfriend enjoyed the $2 mystery beer! Overall, we greatly enjoyed the food however it took us  longer to find it due to minimal to no signage. Luckily the barrista noticed how lost we were and directed us."}
{"text":"The entrance is really awkward, seems like a place where you'd be required to wait to be seated, but not. Fork is dirty, crepes don't have good texture, bings are quite some bullshit... Felt cheated from other reviews."}
{"text":"Awesome find for breakfast. Casual, delicious real food and great coffee. Ricotta toast and grit bowl were delicious! Would come back here for sure."}
{"text":"Very pleased with this place.  The blackberry lemon curd crepe was awesome.  Best side of potatoes I've ever had.  Unique Bloody Mary with homemade juice.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"First place that I've been to that serves kombucha on tap all day, though only one flavor..."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! The menu is brief... but from the three dishes two of us shared I know I want to return and try EVERYTHING on the menu! Exceptionally creative combination of tastes in every dish... a must for foodies! And did I mention, HEALTHY? Wow."}
{"text":"I am kind of a hermit during the workday, but when I do work outside the comfort of my home, BLC is one of my faves. Why? Let me tell you:
+ killer music every time
+ friendly people
+ the choice between bright and sunny booths or the cozier vault room
+ great styling
+ tea comes with an adorable bonus pitcher
+ fifty cent beer check-in offer
+ delicious crepes
+ reliable wifi

Writing this is making me think I should work at Black Locust more often."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast joint! Love their Bings (toasted savory crepes) and best café miel around. The staff are super friendly and chill."}
{"text":"The Black Locust Cafe is perfectly adequate. We ordered a veggie Bing, avocado toast, and the biscuits and gravy - all tasted good, but nothing special. The food took about a half hour to come out and came in waves. The most spectacular part of our morning was sitting in the Robinia Courtyard in the shade - just lovely. Didn't hate it, didn't love it - probably won't think to come here for brunch again, as there are too many memorable brunch spots in town to have anything adequate."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch, and everything tasted great and ready pretty fast. I got a maple latte with almond milk that was a good blend of sweet and espresso. For lunch, I enjoyed the Danny Boy, which had corned beef, hash, fresh peppers and onions, and eggs. The plate was a good meal size and was made well."}
{"text":"This place definitely has an interesting, trendy vibe. It's both a cafe, that serves coffee, and sells beer. I only got the cold brew, which was refreshing and delicious, and the savory crepe. There are a couple of different types of savory crepes, but I got the crepe with cream cheeses and salmon. It was super tasty, but it wasn't super filling. I would recommend this place for a quick bite and coffee, but I wouldn't go here for a full meal. I've yet to try the beer here. I'll definitely come back and try it out!"}
{"text":"I got the southern gent and it was amazing. The biscuits were truly magical. The space is cute and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"This is a must stop for eclectic space, great food at a good price and coffee drinks . Calming music creates a nice place to work outside the office, or a place to meet friends."}
{"text":"First time visiting, and the gentleman behind the counter was very accommodating! Got a $0.50 \"Mystery Beer\" and a delicious tofu/quinoa bowl. Spunky little atmosphere and good food/breakfast/brunch choices. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great sunny spot for a coffee or tea mid-day.  Counter service was competent and quickly made my drink.  The courtyard is a gem.  I can't wait for the restaurant to open."}
{"text":"Causal coffee place. We are here for Chinese traditional Jianbin. The flavor almost there but still has room to improve. Maybe visit again"}
{"text":"Fabulous brunch today, including crepes, biscuits, and a back massage! Can't beat that on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"A friend from home sent us here. I had to make sure it would be good food for my kids. Nutella crepes? Sold! They both scarfed down there banana Nutella crepes. I had an old standby of two eggs, hash browns, sausage and biscuit. All done great. Regular coffee a bit strong but I'm ready for the day. Nice tea selection and very very friendly. Prompt service."}
{"text":"Its all very confusing once you enter with very awkward seating haphazard interiors and not at all a good vibe. I went with some of my friends for Sat brunch and this failed to amuse me in any way. we ordered the salmon crepe and a blackberry crepe and the food was just ok. the cappuccino was good until i found a hair in it . The servers are not the nicest people with banging plates on the table and all. You are not missing out on anything if you have not been here. Please do not let the stars fool you."}
{"text":"I find this little café very distinctive. It has some food that is unusual and quite good. The bings and crepes are both worth trying. It's nice that it's a little off the downtown Madison path and it's usually quiet and cozy. They could be more friendly and helpful with the ordering process. And the layout is somewhat confusing, both because it's mixed in with other restaurants and has many rooms itself. But overall, it's an inexpensive place to get a good quality and different kind of breakfast."}
{"text":"The food was good, the ambiance was cool, the service a little disorganized. They came to our table three times with the wrong food, they put my potatoes on my son's plate. We got our food prior to utensils... Just weird and disorganized."}
{"text":"A cute place with good coffee! Came here particularly for the crepes and they did not disappoint me!"}
{"text":"The kitchen closes at 3 pm. Who does this? I know it used to be a bank and all but who stops eating at 3 pm? Very nice place otherwise. I can't speak for the food (as the kitchen was closed) but everything else was quite nice."}
{"text":"Have been coming here regularly for over a year and it is simply my favorite café in Madison. The space is the exact vibe I need no matter what my mood: sunny and laid-back seats by the window for brunch or meetings, quiet and focused in the side room for serious studying and work, friendly and sociable at the bar, and beautiful outside in the patio. They display some really eclectic art from diverse local artists, and treats like the mystery beers and events like the frequent concerts make it a fun place to hang out. Take some time to get to know the baristas, since they are easily the best in town."}
{"text":"Hands down best crepes in Madison. Had their innovative vegetarian crepe wrap every week for the past month and it's just addicting. Highly recommend if you're into crepes that had soft stuff like squash and avocado inside with a bit of crunch from the wontons, topped with flavorful aioli. Their cappuccino is one of the best in Madison, with the perfect portions - not to little and not too much. They don't have a large selection of pastries, but that's ok since they do everything they do really well."}
{"text":"The only reason for 2 stars is that the drinks are delicious and the order takers are super friendly and patient. My family chose this restaurant for brunch on Father's Day. We had driven our daughter the day before over eight hours to Madison for a summer study program and had to return home. Two of our three orders arrived together with the promise that mine was on the way. At least ten minutes after that, my meal did not arrive. And there was no real apology or ownership taken of the error. Those of us raised on Miss Manners feel uncomfortable eating before everyone is served. This was a disappointment for us at a meal meant as a celebration."}
{"text":"I would describe the bing \"sandwiches\" as crepe burritos. I've tried all three and they are a great breakfast or lunch on their own. Menu crepes are a great choice as well here. The patio is quite spacious and it seems to never be crowded (for now). The service has been pretty slow for food, so maybe not the place if you're in a hurry. I don't claim to know much about coffee, but the regular coffee is a bit dark for my taste."}
