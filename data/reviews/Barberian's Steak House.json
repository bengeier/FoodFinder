{"text":"Overall very good steak. We had a party of 5 no complaints. Wait staff looked a little too busy to provide the service level I would have expected."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto from California; the weather outside was bitter cold (-20c) but the staff at Barberian's brought our dinner party warmth.   From every aspect the service was fantastic. From coat checking right through to the owner (Aaron Barberian), our experience was absolutely the best. We had a rather large party and we were seated in the 'wine cellar\".  What a fantastic area of this historic steak house. The wine cellar is two-story high and has about 20,000 bottles!   Our server (Ange) had obviously been in his trade for many years because he was flawless. Ange answered all of our questions with dignity and respect but brought in a nice sense of humor as well. He made some wonderful recommendations. During the meal he anticipated our needs before we did. Ange blended in nicely with all the members of the party and it was a pleasure to spend the evening with him.  All the food and wine was delicious. Everyone commented on how excellent their food was. The dry-aged beef was of absolute top quality. The desserts were very, very yummy.  It was a meal to remember."}
{"text":"A classic steakhouse in Toronto located just off Yonge street with amazing décor. You feel like you've been transported back in time right when you step in. I dined in the wine cellar in the basement and I must say, it was quite impressive. There's nothing quite like sitting in a rather private area with thousands of bottles of wine around you. Service was also on point.   It doesn't happen often, but it happened here - the steaks were undercooked. We all ordered medium-rare and when the steaks came, they were quite on the rare side to a point where I wondered if the centre got any heat. Fortunately the party was okay with it and we went on eating. We also had the rack of lamb which was actually really good.  I would return to Barberian's just for the experience of dining in a massive wine cellar again. If you want to eat waygu or 40+ day dry aged beef... look elsewhere."}
{"text":"i finally found what i've been looking for in Toronto: a place with history, great food, a cool older crowd, and professional servers. Wonderful! Try to get a look at their basement wine cellar if you can, it's very impressive. A lot of reviewers will probably complain about prices but consider: the drinks they pour are basically triples, and steaks SHOULD cost a lot of money, no?"}
{"text":"Nice place since they let you bring in outside wine, the best way to go when you're just eating steak since pairings not an issue so long as you make the reds good ones - the corkage fee was $40 all in! We had three bottles of wine.  The steak was perfect and came close to my wife's rib steaks which have never be bested.   Personally I like the anachronistic decor and its intimacy. Ask to see their wine cellar, it reminds me of a Paris scene from Interview with a Vampire!  They even had Getty Lee from Rush sitting a few tables down and one of Toronto's famous Cardiologists sitting at another table.  Beware the affluent factor since it doubles the prices but its a nice treat once a year."}
{"text":"I would give Barberian's a 5 if it weren't for the fact that they are inconsistent!  There have been times where the steaks I've ordered were cooked to perfection, other times burnt and overcooked.  Suggestion, if you order medium rare tell them meidum rare and a little bit on the rare side.  I've pretty much tried every steak on their menu and their filet mignon is my favorite. The fact that 1 side is included makes the meal worth it in comparison to other steakhouses..ala  harbour sixty.  The decor is dark, kind of your stereotypical steak house and it is a more mature crowd.  If you want an above average steak this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Just finished our third annual Xmas Eve dinner. Continues to impress us. Fabulous wine list and wonderful staff. Dave you are wonderful."}
{"text":"It's the classic restaurant of Toronto. How does it do it? Consistently great service, food and a wine list that is so big, you're better off asking the sommelier for help (even if you know your stuff).  Treat this as your fun uncle's place that you haven't been to in ages, and they'll treat you like the awesome relative that they haven't seen in ages and will make you feel at home.  Yes, you pay a premium, but if you're planning a fun night out with friends you can't do wrong with this place."}
{"text":"If you like steaks, this is the place. They will cook it exactly the way you want your steak. Same thing with drinks, it's never water down. I love the atmosphere, very casual and the servers are professional with no attitude. It's expensive, but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"One of the best steaks I have ever. The 24 oz rib steak medium rare is the only way to eat steak. If you are going to eat here you must book the wine cellar. The service here is top notch. They are attentive and courteous. A bit expensive but worth it"}
{"text":"Definitely in the top 3 best steakhouses I've been to. Has the old school steakhouse decor in abundance and an impressive wine list for wine lovers.   The service was good as you would expect from a top restaurant. The server didn't rush us, made sure our water glasses were never empty and left us to enjoy our wine once we were finished our food.   We got the bacon wrapped filet mignon and the sirloin, both medium rare of course. The filet was perfectly charred on the outside and tender and juicy. The sirloin was incredibly flavourful. We got mash as a side which was also good. We got the chips and baked potato as the included side. We enjoyed the extra fixings that you get with the baked potato. Fixings included cheese, bacon and sour cream (could be more).   Was too full for desert so can't comment on that. Really good evening and fantastic food, 5 stars."}
{"text":"Ate here recently with a group of friends. I have been here probably 100 times in the last 30 years.So not their best customer by any means , but a long time customer who visits a few times a year. All the food has always been very good. I find in the last 10 years it's better then it ever was. On my last visit I had the rack of lamb, my first time not ordering some sort of steak. It was the best lamb I have ever had. My rib steak on my previous visit was also exceptional. There are a few other great steak houses in Toronto that I go to, but Barberiens is my clear favourite."}
{"text":"In one word.... HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!! I started out with escargot and accidently touched the plate it was in a burnt my finger!!! It was extremely hot and no one warned us that it was so hot and I spent the rest of dinner with a glass of ice cubes that the waiter had to bring to us. I ordered a rib eye steak and after taking my first bite of the steak I suspected it was rancid. I was with a group of ten people and we were all having fun and they all looked like they were enjoying their meals so I hated mentioning it.  I passed my plate around the table and everyone did a sniff test and told me that I had just probably ordered my steak too rare and they thought it was fine. Our waiter was very nice and I didn't want to upset the fun time we were all having so I just left my steak and asked for it to be put in a goody bag although by this point I was turned off my dinner!!!! My finger was throbbing and I had had nothing to eat!!! We all sat and had fun and I went home and within an hour of getting home I became violently sick with what I suspected was food poisoning. I spent the next day in bed and then got my husband to look at the steak which was kept in the refrigerator all night and he took one smell of it and said.... yep that it rancid alright!!!  Oh I forgot to mention that the bill for each couple came to $345   HORRIBLE!!!! What more can I say???"}
{"text":"#sucks: Steak was undercooked, had to return it and I never do that! they ran out of beer. I had no access to my pellegrino until I asked him, guess he thought it was expensive wine. ..never again!  Hy's is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Bin immer wieder gerne in diesem Steakhouse. Für mich eines der Top 5 Steak Restaurants in Toronto. Das Fleisch ist super die Getränke Auswahl ist sehr ordentlich. Ich bisher immer gut bedient worden und habe tolle Abende verbracht. Hier trifft man auch gerne mal Lokale Sportgrößen und Berühmtheiten am Nachbartisch. Es ist zwar etwas teuer aber das Essen ist den gehobenen Preis durchaus wert. Ich kann es nur empfehlen. 5 Sterne"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and I was blown away by the great food and awesome service. Would definitely be visiting again to get the Chateaubriand for 2!"}
{"text":"Incredible wine list, delicious food and superb service all in one, what else could you want.  First class all the way, and what you would expect from a landmark steakhouse in the heart of Toronto!"}
{"text":"I happened to be in Toronto, from Calgary, and was on Younge St... I fired up my trusty Blackberry and attempted to find a local steakhouse. After waiting for my BB Storm to unfreeze (I see there is an apple store at Eaton's Centre)  I saw that I was less than a block away from the Barberian. I walked over, sat at the bar and had a truly delicious NY Strip. I started off with a chowder, and having lived in the Bay Area, found it quite delicious.  The setting was interesting. Like others have said, I had the feeling I was on the set of a 'Godfather' movie. Was there a hit out on me? No... but that didn't stop me from pretending. I sloshed back a couple of glasses of wine and got out of there before the bad guys came. In fact, walking back to my hotel I took a few detours to ensure I lost my tail.   They should ban technology in there, it doesn't fit. Get rid of the TV over the bar. I would come back for the bison special but they did not have it this night."}
{"text":"Three stars are for service and management.  If it was for the food, they would get one from me.  Service is top class.  Bread was average.  Veggies were unbelievably bad.  Who serves steamed asparagus and charges $12.  WTF!!  Veggies at other steakhouses have some effort put in.  My steak came back raw on the inside, twice.  This is a place for old people with more money than brains.  Look elsewhere for better ambiance and waaay better food."}
{"text":"Get stomache right after the steak and french soup. I also asked the hot water which tasted so weired. Will Never return. Disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came for my husbands birthday and we will NEVER return again way too much hype on a place that's outdated and needs to be revamped in a big bad way! The service we were hoping would make up for it, well that was the worst part, our waiter sucked large. The bus boys were awesome and the coat check lady was very nice, but man the waiter was rotten!  The tomato and onion salad was presented in a way that resembled a local diner the lettuce was wilted and I had to add copious amounts of salt and pepper to make it taste decent, when I asked for the oil on the side the waiter snubbed me....seriously the service was beyond below average it was actually stupidly horrendous!   The filet mignon was meh with two count them two stalks of broccoli wow is that what I get for $400.00 plus!!!??? Then the waiter took the oil and vinegar away very nice touch there buddy!! The wines way over priced and the desserts, well can we say hello 1970's.   People save your money and go to the Keg, they actually have better service, better menus and a way better ambience. That's what this place is, a true and honest to goodness RIP-OFF.   Oh by the way did I mention our service was crap!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a mouthwatering steak, cooked to perfection, do not look any further, the Barberian serves it at a more reasonable price than Jacobs."}
{"text":"I love this place. I was craving a good steak so my wife and I came here on our anniversary. The meals are more expensive than your average steakhouse but you get what you pay for. The service is impeccable, which is very rare at most places. The staff is knowledgeable and accommodating. The 1950's ambiance makes for a cozy atmosphere. I ordered the 24oz porterhouse steak. It was hands down the best steak I ever had at a restaurant. I always thought places like the Keg and other steakhouses were good, and they are, but this is a \"real\" steakhouse. I highly recommend this place. Very nice for a night on the town."}
{"text":"It was the most horrible birthday dinner experience in my life.   1. FOOD POISONING - My friend was terribly ill in the next morning, doctor diagnosed him that he got a stomach flu. I feel bad for him seeing him lying on bad for FOUR days.   2. RESTAURANT MANAGER CALLED BACK WITH HORRIBLE ATTITUDE. Four days later, I wrote an email on behalf of my very ill friend about this situation. The manager called back and told me I am false accusing them and denying the fault right away and started to yell at me that I can not speak on behalf of my friend and it must be his own fault eating something else that causes this food poisoning. I went straight ahead to file a formal complain with the city of Toronto regarding this incident.  3. OVERCOOKED STEAK- Both of us ordered medium-rare steak that night, but mine came in \"Well done\" and the quality of the steak was simply not impressing considering each steak cost over $50. Maybe I need to thank God that I escaped from food poisoning. Unfortunately, my friend was the lucky one.  Reading the other reviews, the food poisoning incident happened to other customers as well, I hope there will not be another victim again. From the bottom of my heart, seeing how the manager handle this situation really disappoint me and I am not optimistic that their business will improve."}
{"text":"Before this evening, the last time I dined at Barberian's was 25 years ago. Decided to give it a shot for my partner's birthday as he craved steak. We had made reservations a few days ahead and we were 15 minutes late due to the Green P down the street rejecting my credit card. Not a problem, we were warmly greeted and shown to a cozy table in the corner. The coat check lady is lovely and funny. Promptly shown to our table.  Service is insanely quick . Ordered two dry martinis and before we could turn around they were on the table. Not your standard little martini glasses may I add, but very large, 3/4 full and perfectly mixed. *Clink Clink*  The Caesar salad was so, so. Close to a REAL Caesar although lacking lemon and anchovies but enjoyable...I am a ruthless Caesar critic.The escargot was wonderful according to my partner. My 16 oz rib steak charred on the outside with a gorgeous layer of fat and medium rare...beautiful! (I ate less than 1/2 but the dog will love his breakfast in the morning) My partner had the filet mignon...god knows why he always orders this as I think it's the most tasteless piece of beef going but he loved it and that's all that matters. We both had a baked potato the size of a baby's head, fresh and mealy with shameless amounts of sour cream and chives as requested. My stomach has not forgiven me!   The wine...well you've read the other reviews and it's true. The staff know their wine very well.  The place was packed on a Thursday night with locals, business people and visitors. Great vibe and cozy old school setting which the younger set may not appreciate but we..ahem...the middle aged and older crowd crave vs. cavernous, lofty and loud. Much of the staff have been here for years and years and kudos to them for their wonderful knowledge and friendly banter. The mark of a great employer indeed!  Those that have commented that The Keg is equivalent or better are just purely strange. Barberian's is up there with Michael's on Simcoe and Harbour 60. I haven't been to Jacob's nor do I want to as we had a fabulous meal with cocktails, apps, mains, wine, coffee and dessert for $300 all in with tip.  25 years was far too long and my next visit will be quite soon."}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday night; Their wine list is unreal.  Their service is exceptional.  Their porterhouse.... Needs work! Was dry, flavourless and did not meet my expectations. Hard to accept this as it is a \"top rated\" steakhouse in Toronto. Maybe it was a one off night? Will go back to try another cut."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT steaks but PRICEY.     Probably the best New York Strip I've ever eaten - 5 stars for the main item on the meal but the rest didn't score well .... and I would have no issue with the price ($50-65 range)  either  if steak came with vegetables and possibly a side of salad.   For a restaurant of this high calibre and reputation we were also a bit surprised on a few 'little things' like not keeping us supplied with bread .... and really odd that they would be \"out of mushrooms\"."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. We were starving, just coming into Toronto from flying all day, so you'd think anything would have satisfied. First, they were skimpy with serving the bread....it's just bread, c'mon!! Our steaks were not flavorful, and actually quite tough....even the filet! Baked pototoes were hard and cold. We spent $150.00 and wish we would have spent it elsewhere. Service was good....decor outdated and the woman's restroom is right next to a table....yuck! Wine list is impressive....so I suggest going for a bunch of wine and maybe an appetizer. Not a snob, but I have had so much better!"}
{"text":"Talk about a let down. Honestly i dont know where to begin with how mediocre this place was. So backstory, girlfriend says this is the steakhouse to go in TO. She knows herself a good steak. Well i thought she did but i give her a reprieve on this one.  Ok down to the meat. Its USDA prime Meat from kansas as told by the waiter after i inquired. Not dry aged (i didnt ask but u can tell by taste). So basically i order soup of the day which was rather bland corn and chicken chowder and watery as well. I ordered the porterhouse. Medium cooked. I mean heres the thing, if you outback steakhouse or red lobster steak is fine dining then this steak is your holy grail for cow. But not to sound like a meat snob but ive had steak from porterhouse, delmonicos, capital grill(i live in NY) places where steak is dry aged and pasture grass fed . The cut of meat is marble fatty goodness. Barberians didnt have that. It didnt melt in your mouth or have a buttery taste. It simply was an overpriced outback/chilis/jackastors steak. But if uve never been to the mountain top then this could be your peak.  Wine selection is out of this world. But if you can afford a 1000 dollar bottle u can afford a way better steakhouse.  Ambience is dim light, waiter didnt see enthused to tell us about the menu. It was just a mediocre average experience at best. will you hate it? No prob not. Can you have a taste bud explosion somewhere else with the money ull spend? 100%yes"}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!  Ok, I got pulled into a dinner at Barberian's Steak House because a couple of friends were in town and one managed to convince us to splurge on a steak. If you've read my reviews, you know that value is something I care about deeply, and it's hard to justify $40+ dollars for a grilled piece of fatty salty cow coated in butter. (It's hard for that NOT to taste amazing, people. Really.)  I won't go into detail about the drink menu, but let's just say if you want a shot of Glenfiddich, you're starting at $15 and heading north. When that's the price of one shot, the restaurant is trying to tell you something. Of course, Barberian's caters to the exact kind of people who laugh at such prices in between appointments with financial advisors and BMW dealers. It's a steak-man's lounge: somewhere for Ron Burgundy or a group of executives on the company bill. The decor is straight out of a 1970s magazine ad, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Marlboro Man, in a turtle neck and blazer, was a regular. I think I actually saw Jack Tripper and Larry.  The steak was excellent, of course. The baked potato, served with bacon bits, sour cream, and more butter, was bountiful and hearty. If you like heavily buttered everything, this is your place. We even had some pickled vegetables, obviously buttered, and I have to admit I enjoyed them even though they're not my ideal appetizer next to buttered garlic bread.  If you'll pardon the awful pun: the rub of this Steak House is: it's designed exactly to keep people like me out. It's for people who don't mind spending $70 plus tax and tip on a meal that's, more or less, similar quality and taste to what you might get at The Keg or most chain steakhouses in the nicer parts of town. It's a lounge, and you're paying for the old British carpet, the chance to feel a bit like Bruce Wayne, and the appeal of being inside while the rest of the riff raff stays outside. So, yes, good food and commendable service... but priced too high for my stars.  3 stars"}
{"text":"We went to Barberian's Steakhouse last Friday night. Our friends had rack of lamb, tuna steak and 8 oz. fillet. I had a 12 oz fillet while my +1 has the barbercued spareribs. From the time we entered the restaurant until the moment we left, the service was impeccable.  One could not ask for more attentive service. If you want steak in Toronto, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We come here several times a year, and found ourselves here this past weekend.  We find the service here perfunctory; it's never super friendly or eager, but the service is capable and relatively efficient.  But we're here for the meat, not to make friends with the servers...  We started with shrimp cocktail and a coquilles st. jacques.  Then a bacon wrapped filet mignon and ribeye.  For sides we had fried brussel sprouts and baked potato.  We also ordered a bottle of wine.  The food here is good;  we love the char on the steaks.  Having visited many steakhouses (in Toronto and in the US), is it the absolute best?  No...but the steaks are certainly cooked as ordered - they don't have trouble with a rare filet mignon, while the bacon is cooked and not raw (some places can't seem to manage this combination and the bacon is not cooked).  The ribeye (rare) is very tender.  In the past, I've asked to have the yorkshire pudding that comes with a prime rib order and they've accommodated this request without an issue.  I was happy with a fully loaded baked potato this time.  I do so love their baked potatoes and the very generous spoonfuls of sour cream, feta cheese and bacon!  This is a Toronto institution, and with this being a Sunday night of the civic holiday weekend, it was still relatively busy.  We always call for a reservation, and have always been accommodated.  When we crave a good steak meal, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you would expect it to be, it is a classic steakhouse, decor is hasn't been updated in a while but that is okay.  The service is great and the food comes out faster than you would expect.  I had the French onion soup to start and really enjoyed it, tons of cheese and I like cheese.  My steak was good but it was slightly undercooked."}
{"text":"Für einen anständiges Stück Fleisch ist man hier an der richtigen Adresse.    Ich gebs zu: ich habe mein Fleisch am liebsten well done. Das was ich kriegte war dann bald schon too much. Für den happigen Preis hätte ich unterm Strich mehr erwartet. Die anderen bei mir am Tisch waren hingegen sehr zufrieden, vielleicht hatte ich einfach Pech (solls auch geben). Werde dem Restaurant nochmal eine Chance geben, sollte ich wieder mal in Toronto vorbeikommen.    Die Weinliste ist enorm, selten so eine grosse Auswahl gesehen."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Barberian's at the recommendation of the hotel concierge.  It had been a long day of work/touring/wine tasting in Niagara, and by the time we got back to the city, we were exhausted and looking for a good steak.  Ran across the street in a rain storm and immediately felt out of place after setting foot in the dining room (we were wearing jeans and Nikes and had Niagara Falls misty gunk all over us; most of the other patrons were in suits).  However, we were seated by Mr. Barberian himself, which was fun - and the service all night was excellent. Funny how the more wine you drink, the less you really care whether you fit in or not.  Speaking of wine, the wine list at this joint is off the hook.  Looking through it, I had more than a few WTF moments (asdlkfjasl;kdfj that bottle of wine costs SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS?!?!), but there were a few really great options that proved to be a perfect accompaniment to our dinners.  I wish I had a lot of time and money on my hands; I'd order one of everything off that wine list and just live large for a few weeks.  Loved the pickled vegetables - the cauliflower in particular was ridiculous.  Steaks were good - I've had better at my fave steak place in Seattle - but solid, well cooked, and huge.  Ohh, and the baked potato... nom nom nom.  This is a great place to go if you want a local (non-chain) authentic steakhouse experience in Toronto - we'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"This place is really over-rated. It's like a pseudo-old school steakhouse in that it looks like it should be great, but the food and service don't live up to the trappings.   I ordered the chateaubriand for two which was $109 and we also had two french onion soups.  We ordered the chateaubriand medium, but it came to us medium-rare. Sent it back and they cooked the sliced pieces again on the grill but this changes the texture so was disappointing.  I ordered baked potato with mine and a server came over to the table and put toppings on it (sour cream, cheese, and bacon bits) but he poured bacon bits all over my plate and half the table and then just left it like that.  After we finsihed our appetizers it took about 15 minutes for the staff to clear the plates.  W The table across from ours I overheard two of the people complaining that their steak was also cooked improperly and also sent theirs back. I don't know if they had someone new in the kitchen or what but really not up to par for a place that charges the prices they do.    If you're looking for good steak in an old-school setting and service I'd recommend La Castlie in Mississauga instead."}
{"text":"I recommend Barbarians to everyone!  It was my first get away with my boyfriend, and we decided we wanted to go for a fancy steak dinner so be picked Barbarian's. The food was amazing and our waiter (AM I think are his initials) went above and beyond to make our dinning experience the best. He made us feel like we were the only two in the restaurant and treated us like he knew us forever! We will definitely be back when we come visit Toronto again :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary and boy, was it ever amazing!  We each had a soup to start, I had the soup of the day which happened to be a tomato soup and was delicious. He had the fresh seafood chowder which was also unbelievable. For our mains, I had the 16oz Rib Steak (roughly $50) and he had the 24oz Porter House (roughly $60) both cooked to a perfect medium-rare. Fries, baked potato, mashed potato and steam veggies also amazing. We also each had a different glass of white wine and were both so yummy! Server was very knowledgeable about the wines and helped us to choose the best one for our taste! Service was also impeccable! So polite, very professional. Knew exactly when to tell a joke, and the right ones.  Overall, amazing experience. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great, deliciously and perfectly seasoned steak. I would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I've got two words for you: old school  This place oozes 50s old boys club, but is welcoming to all. I'd say most of the clientèle were men in suits, but there were a few couples and a family as well.  I had the filet mignon, which was cooked to perfection, with a loaded baked potato and caramelized onions.  Everything was delicious and the service was solid. It felt like they've done this a million times, which probably isn't far off.  The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. Maybe I'm just a cheap bastard, but I'm not sure it's worth paying double what you would pay at The Keg Mansion. It's worth the experience because it's like stepping back in time, but I don't see myself becoming a regular."}
{"text":"The BEST.  If you're wondering where you can get the \"BEST STEAK\" in Toronto. Look no further: Barberian's is hands down as good as it gets.   As a huge steak lover, I look for restaurants that offer the best steak in cities around the world and Barberian's WINS for Toronto.  From the amazing service, to the most extensive wine list in the city, Barberian's is the place to be. Favourite plus: picked vegetables at the beginning of the meal."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a kid every time we visit Toronto. The steaks are without a doubt the best quality and flavour within the entire GTA area. The wine list or wine book I should say ranges from a nice light dinner wine to full bodied ranging from all qualities and prices. This is my first recommendation to all friends and family of mine visiting Toronto looking for a great experience great steak and amazing wine."}
{"text":"A friend and I were visiting Toronto and wanted to try a classic old school steakhouse. The ambiance is just that but I was not impressed with my rib eye. The outside had way to much char on it and I ordered medium and it came medium rare. The escargot was fine as was the French onion soup but it's sad when the best thing you eat at a place like this is the garlic bread."}
{"text":"Décor Barberian's is a time warp back into the 1950s or 1960s. The décor is very traditional steak house, wood everywhere and very traditional; I love it. The décor is part museum of Canadiana; I'd want to come in here before dinner service started and just look around at all of the unique pieces of Canadian history that they have.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the traditional feel adds to the charm and appeal of the entire experience. The front bar area is small but very cozy and very attractive (lose the big ugly bowl of licorice and mints though!). This would make an excellent spot for after work drinks or a meet-up if dinner isn't in the cards for you on a particular evening. Be warned, the cocktails are pricey (~$15-17?).    The menu was on a beautiful piece of card stock; elegantly designed with a certain amount of Canadiana whimsical charm to it. It had a nice little piece of history of the steakhouse on the rear.    Food Drinks - My wife ordered a Shirley temple and I ordered a sidecar. My wife said the Shirley temple was the way she likes it. My Sidecar was served ice cold and the balance of the cognac, lemon and Cointreau were perfectly balanced. The drink was of a larger than expected serving size. We did not have any wine but the wine list was very extensive and should satisfy someone with a refined taste in wine. The table next to us had a lengthy discussion with the wait staff about the wine and from what I overhead were very satisfied with the suggestion of the staff.    We received complimentary garlic bread (3 pieces for 2 people which was odd), and a ramekin of pickled vegetables. The garlic bread was typical in a positive way and the garlic dill pickles were excellent. I didn't care for the other vegetables; a matter of personal taste.    Seafood Chowder - My wife had it and enjoyed it. I had a spoonful, it was modestly flavourful but nothing remarkable; I think additional pieces of seafood rather than vegetables in the broth would improve this soup. The portion size was reasonable. 6/10   French Onion Soup - I asked for less cheese as I saw some photos of this soup in advance and it looked very heavy on the cheese.  The abundance of cheese they usually put on the soup indicates that they don't skimp on the ingredient; it's simply my personal taste to go light on the cheese. They accommodated my request without problem and the soup was served as I requested. The soup was moderately flavourful but not the best French Onion I've had (I actually think the Keg's French Onion soup is better.). The bread inside with the soup absorbed most of the both so I was eating soupy, cheesy bread more than anything; I think a larger bowl size and more broth probably would have solved that. 6/10   Prime Rib (medium rare) - My wife had this dish. The serving size of the prime rib is enormous, the biggest serving I have ever seen at a restaurant and could have easily fed both my wife and I. The meat was cooked perfectly to order and was flavourful. The meal came with a Yorkshire pudding and a plain baked potato. A waiter promptly followed up with table service to ladle toppings into your potato from a carousel. Your options include sour cream with chives, feta cheese and bacon bits all at your request. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her meal and from the few bites I had of the prime rib I could understand why; it was excellent. 10/10   New York Strip (10oz) - I asked for my steak to be cooked rare-medium rare and it was done perfectly. The stead itself was learn (I dislike fat/gristle so I enjoyed this) but tender enough and flavourful. The amount of charring on the steak was just the right amount and complimented the flavour of the meat. It was an excellent steak that I thoroughly enjoyed. The baked potato received the same table service for toppings. I had the sour cream/chives and bacon bits. 10/10   My wife finished her meal with the house chocolate mousse. The mousse is placed inside a white chocolate model of the building with a dark chocolate roof. P1op open the roof, eat the mousse and the house itself. Excellent presentation and the mousse was delicious. 8/10     Service  We were promptly greeted with a warm smile as we walked into the restaurant by who I assume was the owner or manager. He quickly offered to take out coats (free) and after quick look at his reservation book we were seated at a nice table. We had 3 different waiters attend to us all with different responsibilities. The service was excellent. Everything was expedient and accurate. Plates were removed promptly, refills were quickly offered, full attention to detail was paid and special requests were accommodated accurately and without problem.    The staff at Barberian's delivered exactly what I would expect for a restaurant of this price point and without any attitude or intimidating pretension."}
{"text":"Barberian's is a unique experience in dining in Toronto. The place feels about as old and stale as anywhere in the city, but if you want a trip back to the 70s its not a bad bet. The service is pretty good, if anything a little too in your face. The menu, like the decor is about as classic as it gets and likely hasn't changed in 20 years.   The steak was decent, but nothing compared to Jacob and probably equivalent to the Keg, but pricier. The accompaniments where the most disappointing part. The green of the day, broccoli, was a very poor excuse for a side. Baked potato was edible, but sub par.   I wouldn't go back myself, but if you get the right things and like the throwback theme, you may be able to justify the cost of Barberian's."}
{"text":"Husband and I each got the surf and turf. The half lobster was huge and delicious. The filet was very tender and had a nice smoky flavor. The mousse in the \"house\" was fantastic. Would definitely return if we're in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Sub-par at best. I think its time for a refresh... the server was GREAT!!! The wine list is extensive. The atmosphere is pretty but i feel like its a bit confused... if your going with vintage stick with vintage- instead its 1950s with 1999.  Now to the FOOD- not good.  Steaks should have been medium rare as requested but were cooked well for most of the party.   Dollar for dollar- go to the keg or Jacob co for a fancier experience."}
{"text":"A must visit in Toronto. Perfectly cooked steak with great service.  The waiter was able to find an obscure wine that was delicious and his recommendations were on point every step if the way.  Would recommend the escargot, scallops (coquilles saint Jacques), and porter house steak."}
{"text":"Worst steak I have. I ordered a medium rare prime beef. But what they offered is a rare portion. Everything is very salted."}
{"text":"Very rude staff that answer the phone for reservations. Had a birthday for over 11 and was told I would get a call back since it was considered an event. That was ok by me. Almost a week passed and nothing. I called back and told them that I was expecting s call from them to make a large reservation and he guy was very rude to me. He didn't apologize that they didn't call back. He then asked me how many people and for what time. I told him and he said I'll see you then and hung up. Not polite at all for a high scale restaurant.  Felt more of cocky attitude as if my business didn't matter and the restaurant would fill up anyways. Good thing their steak is good. Even though it comes at a price."}
{"text":"by far one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. Me and my uncle visiting from Mexico saw it form the outside and it looked like a good place to eat, and no doubt about it it was amazing. I love the old style atmosphere, though its expensive its worth it if you can afford it."}
{"text":"I ate lib steak,it was so delicious! I think this restaurant is little bit too expensive. But if you wanna eat good steak at good atmosphere restaurant you should try!"}
{"text":"By far the best steak in Toronto.  Every kind of steak ordered is prepared differently. The sides are huge and they give you free pickled vegetables (pickels, carrots, etc) as much as you can eat before the food comes.  They also have fresh oyster, om nom.  The bathrooms are very clean as well, they use towels rather than paper towels to keep it's up-scale atmosphere.  Def. oriented toward the upper middle class males but has romantic settings too.  A tad bit on the expensive side but better than keg (and not much more expensive)"}
{"text":"The service was amaaaaazing and the steak was tender. The garlic bread they serve before the entrees is phenomenal. I could've ate that alone and been satisfied. Would definitely return and recommend Barberian's to anyone who likes a good steak, great wine selection, and a moderately upscale atmosphere."}
{"text":"Unique experience, def most go at least once!  You're paying for the 5-star service and big plates of food.  I had the porter steak and my gf had the top sirloin with baked potatoes as sides.  We could not tell the difference between the two in taste. Her medium rare sirloin was too bloodly for her so we ended up switching. My porter t-bone steak had some charred spots.  I may be biased but I believe I have cooked better t-bone myself with onions and mushrooms marinating the grill :). Anyways, still great steaks, nothing mind-blowing though.  She didn't like the pickled veggies that came with everything, but I did. And the garlic bread was amazing!!  For $120, I could of taken her to pickle barrel and had 4 steak meals. We both agreed we would pick pickle barrel next time, but the Barbarian was definitely a nice, romantic place to dine."}
{"text":"$100 meal at a fine dining STEAK HOUSE and can't get the steak right?  Came here with my buddies on Friday night.  This meal was hyped up for us - and was definitely looking forward to the steak all day.  Not much of a beer selection, 2 IPA's with one of them tapped dry at 8:30pm.  Not the greatest beers either but did its job.  Later switched to an overpriced Italian Merlot - definitely not worth the price tag but good enough to be paired with a steak.  Started off with a caesar salad which was... well just a carsar salad.  This wasn't the main event anyway so how good or bad the caesar salad is, was the last thing on my mind.  The main event was the rib steak 16oz, which apparently per our waiter was their claim to fame.  Ordered it medium just the way I like it.  Where this dining experience lost its stars was the fact it came to me very much on the rare side.  Fine dining restaurant and can't even get a medium right?  Come on guys!    When bringing it up to the waiter, he immediately responded \"we can throw it back on the grill for you\".  It was so much on the rare side that he should know, a waiter at a \"fine dining steakhouse\", to get it to medium would dry it out completely now that it was opened up.    This is where the experience fell apart completely.  The waiter did nothing to fix the situation, did not offer a new cut cooked up, did not offer anything off the bill, nor did he offer compensation of any kind.  He didn't care to resurrect the situation - you should expect this level of service for the price you pay.  If you want your steak done right, i would look somewhere else.  Nothing ruins your meal more than a steak cooked 2 levels off from what you requested it... save your time and your money - i sure won't leave it up to chance on a revisit."}
{"text":"I usually don't do this but it's best you know what to expect. The hype of this place is appalling. Marketed as a premier steakhouse in Toronto but really it's outdated and a perfect example of how wide the gap is between a quality steakhouse and Barberians. It doesn't compare to a Jacobs. The atmosphere mimics that of a old, tired restaurant. Cheap interior decor is tired and worn out...masquerading as a vintage steakhouse. The food isn't terrible however there is definite room for improvement."}
{"text":"There is much more than meets the eye. Tucked away in a very popular touristy area of Toronto, Barberians Steakhouse is as good as it gets when it comes to quality food and service. You walk into a very narrow dimly lit entrance with a small bar and coat check that can get very crowded when more than 5 people are packed in. The restaurant is deceptive however, Barberians has a beautiful wine cellar in the basement, a secluded room upstairs and three separate dining areas on the main floor. When we visited this Toronto landmark we sampled from different areas of the menu- the filet mignon, rack of lamb and salmon steak. To start us off they offer garlic bread and pickled vegetables, a great pre-meal nibble to tide you over before biting into a juicy chunk of meat. The food itself though was phenomenal. Filet mignon was served rare wrapped in a succulent thick cut of perfectly cooked fatty bacon. The salty bacon and juicy steak married together create a perfect bite and the loaded baked potato just makes the plate undeniable, this is worth the $60 price tag. The rack of lamb served medium well comes with four delicious lamb shanks. For all the talk of steaks, the lamb and salmon were both pleasant surprises, and items we will definitely keep in mind when we return. And yes, we will return. Do not miss out on this gem of a restaurant, one of the best Toronto has to offer."}
{"text":"I went to Barbarians when my son took me for my birthday. We saw their cool wine cellar dining area which would be a great experience. The service was excellent however I didn't think their steaks were up to the caliber of some other Toronto steak houses for the prices charged."}
{"text":"Great service, ambiance is good. steak was good but I guess was to hyped about the place got disappointed a bit with the steak. Price was reasonable but hard to get a glass of wine Under 30 bucks. Escargots were very disappointing maybe more garlic butter to add a bit of hype to it."}
{"text":"Went to Barberian's on a whim while out of town. I just randomly rode the subway and found a row of restaurants that looked promising. Chose this place because their menu looked great...the ribs lured me in.   Service was exceptional. Easily the strongest service I have received during my weeklong stay.   The food was also very good. As was the wine selection.   My only complaint was the atmosphere, which some may find charming. It was too dim for my liking, like cave dark. Some may enjoy it.   Would return, especially for the service!"}
{"text":"Visiting on an anniversary vacation, we found Barberian's perfectly decent and nothing more.  One Zagat review cautioning that the place rests on past reputation rings true.  The gentleman's club decor gives an air of class, but the food and service, while adequate, do not entirely measure up.  The garlic bread had plenty of butter and garlic, which is welcome, but was undertoasted and used a very ordinary bread.  Perfunctory.  Our steaks were tasty, but I would expect steak to be tasty.  The spinach was overcooked, limp and bland.  The apple beignets were nice but, again, nothing special.  Only the pickles distinguished themselves.  I enjoyed the novelty of both celery and beans, while my wife adored the cucumber pickles.  Still, a $100-a-head meal should deliver more than excellent pickles.  In light of several superior dining experiences in Toronto, from local cafe to four-star eatery, I had to wonder what Barberian's patrons are paying for.  I suspect reputation and a degree of exclusivity.  Certainly it wasn't the food alone."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Barbarians. The first I remember to be quite the experience, but this time it was (unfortunately) completely different. In short, the rib eye came out too charred on the outside. It took away from the meat's flavour, and was hard to get past. Other items, such as their garlic bread, fries and sautéed mushrooms were tasty, but if I'm going to spend $300 on dinner for two, I want everything to be top notch. The old school ambiance is nice and service was decent. I would have preferred if the waiter knew more about the source of the meat, but instead could only give a high-level answer when we asked. The washrooms could have been better attended to for a nice steakhouse. Instead it has your average drug store soap pump and were not well stocked up on their toilet paper/hand towels. Overall I was in good company and we had a pleasant meal, but will no longer tout this as the 'go to' steakhouse in Toronto."}
{"text":"Truly one of the finest restaurants in Toronto although they are quickly pricing themselves out of business.  The ambiance is cozy and inviting. Food is always great, the roast beast is fabulous and the wine list is large and varied.  In short, a delight."}
{"text":"Excellent Meal!  My Fiance had the steak and lobster and it was amazing.  I had a a tenderloin steak and it was cooked to perfection.  Service was exceptional and we loved the atmosphere.  The restaurant has a great vibe and we will definitely return for another dinner in the future!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and approachable place, most of the wait staff are very kind and easy going, not stuffy at all. Started with a martini and my husband and I both had a Greek salad, for a starter it was pretty large, we could have shared. The restaurant had a variety of wines to choose from and many of them are affordable (the bottle of Rioja we ordered was $45). We both got the prime rib steak with baked potatoes and an order of steamed veg on the side. The baked potato wasn't my favourite, it was a bit dry but that does happen with potatoes. If you are iffy on the baked potato front, go with mashed. Go hungry."}
{"text":"Wow, some bad reviews on this place!    I've come here on a few occasions but the first time was with my dad as he's never been to a steakhouse.  He definitely thought it was head and shoulders above any other steak place he had been.  He thought the quality of the meat was a lot better than any other steak he had tried and really enjoyed it.  The place has a very dated steak house look.  Some people will love it, some people will hate it but it definitely looks like a steak house.  I've tried a few of their steaks and each time it's been excellent.  The service has always been great and this place is definitely on the pricey side.  I've only had good experiences at this steak house in Toronto and hopefully it keeps up.  Everything you order is ala carte so there's no meals, you order your steak and sides separately."}
{"text":"This restaurant was highly referred and rates as one of the top steak restaurants in Toronto. We decided to eat here on our last evening in the country. The restaurant is small and tight. We could literally hear everyone's conversations around us. One of my BFFs said the restaurant reminded her of a remodeled funeral home.  The restaurant was dark and there was nothing modern about it. However, the hostess and waiters were very friendly.   Initially, the waiter brought us some hot fresh bread with pickled carrots, cauliflower and pickles to start. These items were excellent. I ordered a house salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing. The salad dressing was horrible. I took a few bites and thought I had swallowed some medicine. For an entree, I ordered the filet mignon cooked medium with a bake potato. The steak was cook to perfection, but didn't have a robust flavor. The steak wasn't bad, but it didn't get me over excited to point of saying it's a must try. For dessert, we tried the apple beignets. The dessert was great. It was apple fried in dough served with vanilla ice cream. Great combination!  The dining experience was great! However, if I return to Toronto in the future it wouldn't be on my list of let's do it again."}
{"text":"Meat tasted like it was full of iron. Was not cooked to request. Very fatty cuts. Decor seemed dingy. For being so highly rated and referred, we were disappointed."}
{"text":"Barberian's is somewhere that you would take your dad for expensive steak.  Dim lit with musty dark wood, it was a bit like walking into a steakhouse in a scene of an old mafia movie.  The steak was good but it wasn't the best steak I've ever had. I ordered the filet mignon wrapped in bacon (8 oz) . For  $41.75, I expected my steak to not be overcooked... The sauté mushrooms were perfect with the steak, and for $6.50 they should be perfect!   They do have a fantastic wine list as well. The more moderate priced wines weren't very exciting.   But they had some great Italians bottles... just be ready to spend.   I can understand why people like Barbarian's, but it's just not a steakhouse for me."}
{"text":"My experience here is awful. The restaurant was recommended by several friends who were with me and they were surprised at how bad the food and service are compare to their prior visit. We went on Victoria Day. The restaurant seemed deserted and short staffed. Our waiter seemed to be rushed and trying to spend as little time with us as possible. A few word here and there while walking by. I ordered my stake medium rare. It seemed to be cooked right but lacked flavor. The cut is poor with lots of tendons. It would have been fine if it cost $25 instead of $60. My friends were very surprised as well. They ordered similar steak last time and was much better.  They also mentioned that the service was much better last time - the waiter was patient and introduced with a brief history of the restaurant.   It seemed that they were not ready to serve on this particular day. And it could just be one of those bad days. If you are looking for a restaurant with consistency in food and service. This is not the place. If you had to try, do not come on Victoria Day.   On the positive side, hence two stars, the wine selection is excellent. Lots of premium wines. Bottle price are between $200 and $8K+.  Ambient is nice and classy. You feel the history of this place."}
{"text":"Brought my fiancé here as a treat for his birthday and it was a nice experience but I'm not sure if it warranted the hefty bill at the end. We both got caesar salads for starters, for mains I got the 8oz filet mignon (medium) with the baked potato & sautéed mushrooms,  he got the 16oz rib steak (medium rare) with Bearnaise sauce, mashed potatoes & a jumbo shrimp and for dessert we shared the apple beignets. The caesars were OK, quite fishy tasting which I liked but my fiancé didn't. The steaks were cooked perfectly and were so tasty! The baked potato comes with sour cream, bacon bits & feta which was yummy but I wish I had gotten the mashed potatoes as they were unreal - well worth the upgrade! The apple beignets were so good and perfect for sharing. Overall, the food & wine were great, the service was spot on and the ambiance was nice. It was lovely for the special occasion that was in it but I just doubt that we'll come here again as $300 for a meal is a bit much I think."}
{"text":"I was attracted by their name so I stopped and ate.  This is an old fashion classy price, with a hefty price tag.  I ordered their French onion soup and 16oz rib eye.  The soup was nice, not the best, but nice.  The steak was undercooked, not as flavourful as I hoped or had around the corner.  They give pickled carrots as starters which was interesting.  Their wine list comes in a binder, quite impressive.  Imagine the inventory check!  This is a place for good impression, but not drooling factor.  I probably will spend my well earned sweat money somewhere else.  You can easily find something similar around the finance district for same price and better quality.  The End."}
{"text":"Barberian's has been a favourite for many years.   Great red meat and red wine. The prime rib is a favourite of mine and the steaks are exceptional as well. Their wine list has to be seen to be believed and their wait staff are knowledgeable and helpful.  One of the best Toronto has to offer."}
{"text":"If you like hamburger well done without a bun then you'll like this place.   Don't WASTE your money on this over glorified joint as McDonald's is just down the road and you can at least walk away satisfied!  Torontonians are not known for their palate. This restaurant is frequented by those very people. Wake up! Their are decent restaurants at fair prices where the clientele are not taken for granted and the cuisine is of quality!"}
{"text":"always a great steak, and the service and ambiance is unique and special. The private room downstairs is a great place for 'power dinners' and parties. Best wine cellar in the city"}
{"text":"Dinner  Ordered: Rib steak and salad.  Food, service,ambience: 4/5  Value:3.5/5  Repeat: not sure  notes: Extensive wine list, setting is more like a saloon/parlor."}
{"text":"Best steak house in Toronto with clubhouse feel.  Food: 4/5 Great steaks with satisfying sides. Service: 5/5 Friendly, diligent and quick Environment: 4/5 Cozy prohibition clubhouse feel. Washrooms: 5/5 Clean and comfortable. Worth it?: 4/5 Very Pricey but expected.  Great selection of steaks always cooked to the perfect level. Getting sides with your steak is a nice touch and maybe the other big three steak houses in town should take note.  Appetizers are sized well so be prepared to feast like a barbarian. Escargot was good. Pâte plater was my favorite thing there.   Dinner at Barbarian's is always memorable. 4/5 points on the food only because it is far on the pricey side. Great for important engagements. Service is always pleasant.   Great whiskey selection. Always with the barbarian pour. Great wine selection with one of the biggest wine collections in Toronto. If you ever gets chance to take a look at their red's cellar definitely take it. You can reserve to have  a dinner in the cellar if your party is big enough. The white's are in a different building without visitor access.  Will definitely come again. Be prepared to feast like a Barbarian and be treated like a king. Also be prepared for a hefty bill."}
{"text":"Well spank my ass and call my Yelpy, what a feast we had on Saturday night. I think I took the idea of a diet cheat meal to a whole other level! Two Christmases my mother in-law to be (bless her heart) gave the greatest gift a meat eating fella could ask for - gift certificates to two great steakhouses. Last year we used one gift card to go to Ruth's Chris to witness the \"sizzle\" and it was a good experience. We squirreled away the other certificate for Barberians for a \"special occasion\" and when one didn't come up we decided a 2 year anniversary was as fitting as any other occasion so we booked!  Barberians has been near the corner of Elm and Yonge since 1959, it's a modest old home from the outside maintaining a classic charm from days of past. Entering the front you'll note the bar and complimentary coat check. The decor and dim lighting screams of 1960's class and sophistication - think of early seasons of MadMen where Don and Roger would go for bottomless Martini and Oyster lunches.   The staff, equally as dapper as the venue are dressed in white shirt and tie with a dress vest and apron.  Upon arrival for our 6pm reservation we were taken immediately to a great corner table in the one of the main dining rooms. Our server immediately offered us water and informed us of the specials and drink offerings. I asked about cocktails and he said without hesitation that they were known for their Manhattan and their Martini's, but that they were very boozy. Perfect, I'll have one. My fiancée had a class of House red wine. The Manhattan came out extremely quickly, almost making me wonder if there was a punch bowl of Manhattans pre-made somewhere, I mean it's not a hard cocktail to make but golly was that quick. The first sip was all booze and I nearly retched, but I gave it a moment to settle down on my palate and chill in the glass any from second sip onwards this was near perfection.  Hungry, we wasted little time deciding and were ready (and well researched) for what we wanted by the time the drinks arrived.  We decided to share two appetizers, the escargot and the caesar salad (you gotta have caesar salad at a steakhouse, you just have to). Our server was great and even offered to split the salad for us into two \"smaller\" portions before it left the kitchen, and each portion was huge in it's own right. I imagine the salad might be a bit too big for just one person, so keep this in mind when ordering. The dressing was fantastic and I was able to taste all the the signature elements that make a classic season dressing perfectly. As for the Escargot, lovely, plump and dredged in butter and herbs. Stellar.  On to the mains, my fiancée went for the Salmon main with a side of fries, I was torn between a Porterhouse steak and my goto Rib-steak. I started to explain my dilemma to our server and before I could get my words out he said \"rIbsteak\", I continued to explain and he said, \"with out question Rib-steak\". Wow, A strong recco. I asked why and he said they take extra special care with this cut and dry age it for 20+ days before it's served. He had me drooling so I ended up ordering not the reasonable 16oz size, but the 24oz just for good measure (that's nearly 2 pounds of marbled meaty goodness) and got fries on the side as well. The steak arrived and was glorious, perfect char on the outside, well marbled and cooked to one of the best medium rare temperatures I've ever had and it was THICK. Like real thick, it occupied 2/3 of the custom printed plate. A top choice cut of meat and top steak. I was full about 10oz's in, but by a combination of greed and respect for the restaurant that cooked it, I polished the steak off and licked the bone clean - seriously there wasn't a scrap left.  I should have ended up right here and then, but my dessert stomach had yet to be satisfied. My lady and I ended up deciding that being a \"cheat night\" that we should go whole hog and split a dessert. Banana split was the choice and like everything else it was huge and practically perfect in every way. Paired that with a heavy shot of fernet to help digest, a coffee for me and Monte Cristo Cafe for her.   Are you hungry now? Well you better make a phone call, I bet they've got a table this weekend with your name all over it!  MEATcrest Out!"}
{"text":"The decor was interesting: red walls, exposed beams, guns/rifles on the beams/walls, and the women's bathroom must have been added not too long ago, it was in an odd place. It was stocked with mouth wash and such though. The food was better than expected, they definitely know how to do steak and do it amazingly well! They also had an amazingly impressive list of wine.  This is a great go-to steak place if you're craving meat. I wasn't the biggest fan of the decor, but totally worth a visit to satisfy your inner carnivore."}
{"text":"Came here for my boyfriend's birthday last night. Had a wonderful experience here. Told the server to bring out a slice of cheesecake with a candle on it, and they outdid my request! Was pleasantly surprised. They even presented him with a bottle of their steak marinade! The staff are really courteous and super friendly.  As for their food, their soups are to die for. Both the seafood chowder and French onion soup are delicious, and a must try!We ordered filet mignon and rib steak. Both dishes were really well done, but we felt that it was over priced. We've had similar quality steaks elsewhere for a fraction of the cost. Otherwise, this place has excellent service and great tasting food. I would definitely recommend this place to someone who wants to go out for an occasion."}
{"text":"Dating back to the year we eloped to Canada in '84, we go to Barbarian's every time we're in Toronto.  We each order the same thing:  Filet Mignon Wrapped in Bacon, rare.   Every once in awhile, we may add dessert, but we go primarily to eat beef.  We have never left dissatisfied.  The servers are always male and service is attentive and efficient.  (I recall we had the same server in '04 that we had had in '84, so these are people whose careers are serving tables at restaurants.)  We have never bothered with appetizers or other entrees.  We don't drink anymore - plus the taxes on alcohol in Canada would discourage us if we did drink - but I have seen the wine cellar and its contents are stunning.  I doubt the decor of the restaurant has changed at all since we were first there in '84, but that's okay because we go there in a way to relive a moment in '84.  I suppose it's a silly ritual to order the same thing and never check out the other items - but the illusion has never been disrupted because every time the protein is cooked precisely as ordered and is mind boggling good.  So good it has ruined us for steaks elsewhere or at home.  Why bother when it won't taste as good as Barberian's?"}
{"text":"I just love this place....we always make sure to eat here when in Toronto. My absolute  favorite steak is the pepper steak, filet or NY strip....When I'm home I find myself thinking of Barberian's and wanting to hurry back....the white chocolate \"house\" mousse is wonderful!!"}
{"text":"To begin with, the decor is outdated but since this place is an old school fine dining that was sort of expected. Our waiter took our order and mostly disappeared. The food was nothing to write home about. I ordered the prime rib but boy, it was a tough piece of meat, I had to chew, chew and chew a little more to break down the tissue. I finally gave up. The meat was completely unseasoned and cold, even the au jus was bland. The only item on the plate that was passable was the Yorkshire pudding. On top of that, the tables are small too, two people sitting on the same side of the table elbow to elbow."}
{"text":"A Toronto institution, this one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. It's a classic old school steakhouse but they get it right. Service is always amazing (John is the best!) and the wine list is unbelievable. Great for business dinners as well."}
{"text":"Great service & food. Do not let the exterior fool you inside is a great atmosphere with a friendly feel. I ordered the smallest steak they had and it came with a choice of potato fries or rice. It was more than I could eat but cooked perfectly. Definitely worth trying. I recommend reservations"}
{"text":"This place is so old school I felt young again!  I only went for snacks and a couple of beers at the bar but I want to go back, if only to hang out and watch the pros in action.  I met a colleague as we're checking out Barberian's cellar (which is AMAZING) for an event next month.  I'm from out of town and once I walked in I wanted to stay at least for a bit.  I saw the Steamwhistle truck around Vancouver all summer so figured I'd have a pint of that to start.  I was ready for a snack so we ordered a couple of shrimp cocktails.  Four massive prawns came out on a plate with a spicy cocktail sauce.  It was like being back in the '80s only better.  MASSIVE PRAWNS!!!  We also got a dish of their marinated pickles which consisted of cauliflower, carrots, beans and yeah, pickles.  Crunchy zesty goodness.  Next up was some paté.  I was told by my buddy that they make this stuff in-house.  Holy artery clogging deliciousness Batman!  This was so smooth and beautifully flavoured I was seriously considering planting my face right into the plate.  Throw in some gently garlic-ed, warm crusty bread and it was like a time warp into another era when life was less complicated.  Mike was the name of the burly, smiling bartender.  I met the sommelier, a petite woman, Christine, who is breaking through this traditional bastion of manliness.  Kudos to her!  I also met the owner, Arrron, who'd been greeting people and working the room with a warm smile.  He had one of those sincere handshakes that uses both hands.  Serously if I lived in Toronto this would be my preferred place to relax after work with a couple of pals while being entertained by the super-cool staff.  Nice!"}
{"text":"if I could give Barberian's 6 * I would. The service was amazing. A family with young children came in and our waiter asked us if we would like to move to a different table. the food was amazing and they even had hp sauce.   food Smoked salmon appetizer- amazing 16 oz rib eye- cooked perfectly sauteed spinach"}
{"text":"I think this place is over-rated and you can get steaks just as good for alot cheaper. They did have an adorable little chocolate mousse filled in a rich chocolate shaped store front."}
{"text":"Toronto- Warm and welcoming people from start to finish.  The meal was excellent with four of us having each a different steak from the 10oz sirloin to the rib eye to the prime rib.  Everyone was thrilled with the meal and sides and the Apple/ice cream dessert was fabulous.  Augusto and the rest of the wait staff were top notch.  Not inexpensive and a wine list and wine cellar to be envied by the best."}
{"text":"The ambiance is what one would imagine for a steak house in 60's, 70's or maybe even 80's. We are talking dark interior, servers in vests with immaculate attention to detail, a wine list that goes on forever.  So if one seeks those qualities I would say this place will be enjoyed by you. However things have changed even for steak houses one needs to up their game for food.  We were here in a mid sized group and called in ahead for reservations.  I ordered a French Onion soup though visually appealing it was devoid of taste. I had to resort to loading it with black pepper just to get some feeling out of it.  The main I had a filet with a side of fries and bernaise sauce. While cooked to the right consistency It didn't wow. Another diner who had ordered the steak with black pepper sauce commented that the sauce was like from the bottle and just lathered on the steak which left little option to portion control.  Don't get me wrong they do serve a decent steak but once one can factor in the cost/value proposition they are comparable to chain steak house spots. 2.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Consistently poor service every time I've been here. Meals components are severely staggered across all courses, mistakes in orders, and they don't fix it. Sadly, once the waiter realises he has flubbered everything up, he stops caring because he realises that there is going to be no tip for him or the kitchen and then your dining experience spirals even further down hill.   My advice: Buy the steak spice from your grocer and a nice cut of meat from your local butcher."}
{"text":"Really poor sample of a steakhouse. The quality of the food is sizzler quality. The service is absolutely absolutely absolutely terrible. Total attitude total incompetence and total stupidity. Trust me you're better off going to sizzler than eating this so-called food and the service isn't even so-called it's terrible."}
{"text":"The experience you have at a restaurant can be influenced by the company you are with. In this case I was here with Eddie, a romantic date that would not be soon forgotten.    We both love the food and service. Detail to everything from the delicious pickled veggies to the side table service. This is a classic old style steak house, once popular and now becoming hard to find.  Whenever I walk into a place like this I often wonder who else has walked through these doors over the years. Clearly this place has history.  We ordered the chateaubriand for two, cooked medium-rare.  It came with a choice of standard but no less delicious sides. It was cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth. Only once I enjoyed a better Chateaubriand and that was in  Puerto Vallarta at a place called the Rio Grande with my friend Perry.  If you haven't been to Barbarians I would encourage you to go before this type of food experience disappears.  If you are into trendy and not so good food keep going, this place won't be for you.  If you are looking for a throw back in time and quality, this is it.  We loved it and very reasonably price for the quality. One of the best."}
{"text":"This place is great. Has a unique 60s like interior. Very dim and not as busy as we thought it would be. We made a reservation, but even without a reservation we would be seated quickly since it wasn't overly busy.  Upon seating, you're served garlic bread & butter along with pickled veggies.   Our waiter was good and knowledgeable. Helped us pick out a great wine for our table a was spot on with describing the kind of oysters they had that night.   The steak was done perfectly. We asked for medium rare, and got just that. Nice and pink in the inside."}
{"text":"Great cozy spot to take your date or have a big steak with your buddies. Parking was a little inconvienent. Prices weren't out of line, service was exemplary and you'll either love or hate the decor.  For me it was perfect as I like a dim and quiet setting to enjoy my meal like a king.   They served amazing garlic bread and pickled veggies to start. Next came our French Onion soups which were good (nothing over the top) but Id say your much better off here with the Caesar salad as the dressing is homemade.   We asked our server for a steak recommendation and he pointed us towards the \"bone-in\" Ribeye which is dry aged in house for 26 days. I liked the sound of that and always prefer a steak with the bone attached so we got 2 of those with the added Tiger shrimp option for 13$.  The steaks were outstanding! Perectly cooked with just enough seasoning to compliment the beef. I'd say the steaks were worth every dollar and \"when\" I go back it'll be the Ribeye or Porterhouse. P.S the sauteed mushrooms side order is to die for. I don't know how they prepped these but they were the most earthy and succulent mushroom i've ever had.    The only reason I chose 4/5 stars is because the 13$ tiger shrimps which I and my friend both opted for were cooked on the grille which charred and dryed them out. They were big but unnecessary and didn't compliment the steak well.   I can't wait for my next chance to go back and when i do i'll be ordering a salad and asparagus instead of the soup or shrimps."}
{"text":"Prices are very affordable for a steak house, but I felt like the steaks weren't the best. I had much better at Jacob's. I've been here twice and I think I won't be going back. Last time I went back the steak one of my friend ordered was cold and the $12 giant shrimp is overpriced and under delivered."}
{"text":"I went to Barbarian's Steak house last night and thoroughly enjoyed the meal.  I started off with a jumbo shrimp cocktail - HUGE meaty shrimp. Very tasty  And had the 8 oz bacon wrapped fillet mignon - Another winner. The steak was thick and tender and I savoured every bite!  sautéed spinach on the side - really flavourful and not too buttery.   Service was excellent. Waiter was polite and knowledgeable.   The atmosphere is dated. This place isn't even trying to be chic with red printed wall paper and dim lighting. It was the same decor as when I was there 10 years ago for New Years eve. Definintly more of a \"guys's place.\"  But all in all, Barbarian's is a darn good steak house!"}
{"text":"Barberian's is a nearly 60-year-old family-owned Toronto steakhouse that exults in its old school steakhouseness. I went for a late Friday night dinner with a large party, and I greatly enjoyed the bloody steak and the strong ambiance. Fancy, decadent fun.  It was a great venue for a group of twelve, one that didn't require us to commit to a set menu or a private room. We got a long table in the moody, cozy dining room, and we were able to relax and have a good time. Service was on the slow side. We were seated quite a while before the food started to arrive. It was pleasant enough, though, and I'm sure it wasn't easy to attend to all of our needs.  This was definitely a place that called for classily immoderate drinking. I started my dinner with a nice Manhattan, then shared in the various bottles of red wine that were ordered for the table. I haven't the faintest idea what any of them were, but I enjoyed every swallow.  The food was solid, starting with complimentary bread, butter, and pickled vegetables. I really appreciated those pickles, a generous heap of cucumber, carrot, brussels sprout, and cauliflower, full of snap and vinegar. Barberian's has a pretty no-nonsense steakhouse menu, with plenty of meat and simple sides. I went in on a rare 24-ounce porterhouse with two friends, and this was an excellent steak, tender and full of flavor. We got it with a side of rice, which was also great, fluffy and seasoned enough to eat on its own. I also liked the tomato and onion salad and the sautéed mushrooms, which we ordered for the table. Exactly what they sound like, very well prepared.  I had a fantastic time at Barberian's. My dinner was immensely satisfying, and I loved that old school atmosphere. I'd recommend this place if you're looking for good meat and swanky vibes while hanging in Toronto."}
{"text":"I ended up at this steak house with a bunch of co-workers and was immediately worried as I am a vegetarian. I thought I'd be stuck with a bunch of sides such as potatoes and beans. Turns out they have a butternut squash ravioli that they make from scratch and I thought it was the best I've ever had! I hope to come back and try it again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse in Toronto. I would recommend the rib steak and a nice bottle of robust red wine. I've had the NY before which was amazing but the rib cut has to be the king of steaks and this place gets it right! Cooked perfectly, perfect amount of char, and super-tender-fatty-marbley-goodness!! A must try."}
{"text":"I'm sure there will be people who will argue that I am way off in giving Barbarians a 3 star rating. This place is pretty iconic in Toronto as being one of the best steakhouses in town.  I've known about Barbarians for decades but never bothered. I finally went last night because a guest from out of town REALLY wanted to go.  The ambiance is really quite nice. It's dark and cozy and quite upscale. The servers seem to be a bit high on themselves for working at such a famous place but at least they do their jobs well; they just do it with an air of arrogance.   Most importantly, the steaks were good, very good, not the best good, but very good. The thing is, that's the clincher! I've had better steak for a quarter the price here in the city. Just find one of the better churrascarias in little Portugal and you'll have a better steak at significantly lower prices.  So the rub is that their prices are very high! I had a 24oz Rib Steak for $70 and my wife had a 8oz Filet Mignon for $55.   Also, I don't know what it is about steakhouses around the world but they serve the most embarrassing side dishes? I had a slightly flavored side of plain rice. My wife had a baked potato with toppings. Our guest had fries... FRIES at a place that charges big bucks?  The food was a 4 The service was a 3 Prices 2  I'll share one thing about my price rating. I couldn't give it a 1 because I've been to a place a few years back that charged me $120 for an 8oz steak that was one of the worst steaks of my life so they get to keep the 1 rating for themselves.  Overall, I hate to say that Barbarian's earned itself a 3 star rating.  Now, I've recently been wondering if it's fair to criticize a place without offering solutions so here goes.  If you're going to charge as much money as you do, get creative with side dishes. As an example, offer up something like pulled pork bourbon mac and cheese, make the fries into a good quality poutine, get creative with a savory ice cream that could be served together with the steak.  You may argue that you don't want to detract from the steak experience but then you just have to think about how to complement that experience. Here's the thing, Toronto is an AMAZING restaurant city and you have lots and lots and lots of competition. If I can confidently recommend a half dozen cheap local family owned places that serve better food than you, then you can't possibly earn a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses in the city! Dinning there is an experience in and out of itself and the food is remarkable! The atmosphere is so cozy and the dim lighting sets the perfect mood. If you want to impress someone, take him/her there!! Amazing wine selection and service is impeccable!"}
{"text":"Best steak in Toronto. I'm s born and raised Toronto woman, and this is the best steak I've ever eaten. Tasted like it was marinated in butter n bacon. Mmmmmm Lobster was Devine. Wine selection the size of the bible. Creme Carmel is my favourite dessert of all time. I'm in heaven."}
{"text":"Great meats and wine, french onion soup was ok. Didnt mind paying an average of $50 a pop for the steaks but the maitre d (?) wasn't exactly the warmest person on the floor, nor was our waiter... got better service from the valet guys and the servers  i got the 16oz rin steak, with french onion soup, and red wine, hubs got the sirloin and chowder... basically good food, but could better service could have made our experiencea lot better"}
{"text":"I've been in this area countless times in my school days and now work and strangely have never noticed this establishment.  We just had the occasion to venture in for a birthday dinner.  Ambiance and history (as detailed in the menu) is impressive; hard to deny a building that is pre-Confederation.  First thing we noticed as we walked in was wow, is it dark in here?!  Service was professional although not as prompt as we prefer it.  We enjoyed various steaks all around and to be honest, it was just mediocre.  For the price point, we were a little underwhelmed as we felt the presentation was a tad lacking (my side of fries was literally strewn across my plate, not even a vegetable garnish).  The steak was juicy but almost painfully difficult to ignore the impact of lack of presentation).  Tables are a bit squeezed together as our waiter could not easily maneuver in behind our chairs to refill water glasses as our backs were on another table.  Overall, it was a nice opportunity to sample a restaurant once voted best steakhouse in TO but unfortunately, as much as we wanted to, we really didn't see why..."}
{"text":"Fire up the DeLorean and crank the Huey Lewis - we're going back in time!  The Barberian family has been satisfying discerning carnivores in the same intimately lit, wood-panelled dining room since the late Fifties. And not a lot has changed since then. You'll find original Group of Seven paintings on the wall and a suited maitre d' at the front door. Celebrity sightings aren't uncommon (notably, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton got engaged here), but autograph seeking is frowned upon.  The two-story underground wine cellar offers 3000 selections (over 15,000 bottles!), and the menu features glorious slabs of steaky deliciousness - from perfectly timed centre-cut nine-ounce sirloins to a 24-ounce porterhouse, cut and aged in house.   One of the oldest steak houses in the city, Barberian's is a healthy dose of Canadiana and true indulgence for any carnivorous craving."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Toronto hands down. Best French onion soup! Dined tonite, shared the 3 lb lobster, amazing!! Fast and great service from our waiter CJ and Pat at the front. Celebrated my birthday there and will return again and again. Cannot be matched!"}
{"text":"We had the porterhouse steak and roast beef, booth with the peppercorn gravy and a side of fries and baked potato. Our food was good, the fries and the garlic bread were delicious! The potato comes with sour cream, cheese and bacon toppings as well which is awesome!   I docked a star because service was not good. Our server put in minimal effort, carried our water glasses to our table with his hands around the rim, and was quite cold towards us. When we asked questions about menu items such as the fish of the day, he was unprofessional and not very helpful with making recommendations."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quality piece of meat... you will find it here.  This is the ideal place to go if you are looking for a romantic date, business dining or a nice family meal.  A little on the pricer side, but are well compensated for their quality of service and food.  - Old antique atmosphere  - Great steaks: rub, texture, flavour - all great. - Excellent service - Bit on the pricey-side but hey, if someone is bringing you there, they must really love you.  My story:  I went there on a romantic date for two and it was a great dining experience.  Our waiter was pleasant and our food was spectacular.  Our waiter thought he goofed up on something (like bringing our food 4 minutes later, but we were enjoying our wine) and we didn't even notice.  We were greeted at the coat check with a nice surprise as he showered us with 2 bottles of free Barberian's Famous Steak Seasoning...   Wow, he didn't goof up in our eyes, but we took the seasoning home anyways and it's awesome :)"}
{"text":"From reading many reviews about the amazing service here, we decided to give it a try. Although the food was great, I wouldn't say our service was spectacular.   We had the house salad to start which was enough for two people. I had the filet mignon wrapped in bacon with baked potato and was surprised by the large portion sizes and the steaks incredible quality.   Would recommend- the corn brûlée as an accompaniment to the main. So freaking delicious, and the brûlée layer at the top makes you question whether this is actually a dessert.  Would NOT recommend - (1)the jumbo shrimp as an accompaniment. The $12 shrimp gets you just one piece of shrimp, which I found super weird considering all their other food items came in fairly large portions.  (2) the mango sorbet was horribly sweat and poor quality. Their other ice cream selections are merely the basics -choco vanilla and strawberry.  We also really appreciated the manager asking us on our way out, if we needed a ride anywhere."}
{"text":"Very nice steakhouse. Expect to pay at least $100 for dinner for 2. It is definitely worth the price. Friendly waiters working together set this restaurant apart from other \"high class\" steakhouses I've visited. My wife and I split the 24 oz ribeye steak since it was too massive for either one of us to devour ourselves ( and because it was $69 ). All in all I'd recommend this place to anyone asking for a nice steakhouse in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Outstanding. We were in town for a business meeting and I found this place on Yelp. Wasn't sure what to expect and was really really happy we chose this place to eat. The food (oysters, lobster, steak, fried brussel sprouts) and service was excellent and we even got to meet the owner on our way out. If you're in Toronto, this place is a must!!"}
{"text":"Very good.  Cool atmosphere. Very manly old world charm. Great service. High quality steak. The sides are amazing.  The Brussels sprouts are great. Highly recommend the fillet mignon.  Generous sides. Jacobs will impress a date more, especially a female one.  But this is a great place that offers great steak. Good hang dinner place if u really like steak"}
{"text":"Traditional steakhouse at its finest. Cozy atmosphere. Bread, pickles and carrots are offered right away, which I really enjoyed! My dad and I shared a salad which was perfect. A salad for myself would have been too much. The meal was perfect. Service top notch. What really impressed me...when leaving I waited outside to try to hail a taxi. My dad can't walk very well so I told him I'd walk up the road to get one. It was cold and windy that night. The gentleman working the valet saw we were cold and asked if we needed a taxi. I said yes. He literally ran down the street and got the attention of one taxi to turn around and get us. Wow! I've never seen service like this. He could have said nothing. His job is to park cars, not chase down cabs. He really went out of his way for us and for that, we will return. We both raved the whole drive back about the restaurant."}
{"text":"Very nice. Quality meal. Lovely atmosphere. The prime rib was delicious. It came highly recommended and we were not disappointed."}
{"text":"After talking about it for months, my boyfriend and I finally made our way to Barberians for an unforgettable dinner to celebrate some personal achievements (and enjoy a fancy date night).  I made reservations two weeks in advance.  I'm not sure if this was necessary, but I'm a 'better-safe-than-sorry' kind of girl.  I called their reservation line and left my name and number, but I didn't get a response confirming our dinner until I followed up via e-mail later in the week.  Nothing too difficult, but it would have been nice to have someone make contact with me.  The experience we had, however, quickly made up the annoying reservation system.  Thanks to our reservation we were seating immediately (after dropping our coats off at the complimentary coat check) in a dining room near the kitchen.  The space was intimate, and the tables were close together, but not claustrophobically so.  The ambience is moody and romantic, but not so dark that the menu is tough to read.  There is a significant amount of noise that drifts over from other tables, but it wasn't so intrusive that it interrupted our meal or our conversation.  Our server was Andrew and he did a fine job of taking care of us throughout the evening.  We ordered a bottle of Ontario chardonnay from the EXTENSIVE wine list (I've had textbooks that were smaller), and it came out quickly and was chilled perfectly.  For dinner, we ordered the chateaubriand for two, cooked medium-rare.  With our meat we were offered a choice of fries, baked potato, or rice as a side.  This was a pleasant surprise as I've been to steakhouses where the sides are NOT included in the price of the meat.  While waiting, we nibbled on veggies and devoured the complimentary basket of  bread, still warm and soft and dripping with garlic butter.  Our dinner came quickly, and chateaubriand was carved for us directly at the table, a nice touch.  I always order medium-rare whenever ordered steak and it took tasting this gorgeous piece of meat for me to realize I may have never eaten a \"perfect\" medium-rare steak before this.  It was beautifully charred on the outside, with a perfect circle of delicious, warm, pink meat on the inside.  Absolutely sublime.  The sides were good, and the cherry tomatoes that came with the meal were truly surprising.  Not a huge tomato fan, I gave one a shot only to realize that it didn't taste like a tomato at all (in a good way).  It was as though the tomato was injected with garlic and spices, and grilled to perfection.  It tasted like a burst of bruschetta, all contained within a tiny vegetable.  Amazing.  For dessert, my boyfriend ordered the apple beignets and I ordered the creme caramel (which Andrew had to sadly inform me was sold out that evening).  Instead of insisting I order something else, he suggested we split the apple dessert, and I am so grateful that he did.  The dessert arrived, plated individually with two portions that were so sizeable I found it hard to believe that this was intended to be one dessert.  The apples themselves were amazing, coated in sugar, cinnamon and walnuts, and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Eating here was undoubtedly a splurge.  After two bottles of wine, dinner, and dessert, our bill came close to $300 for the two of us.  That being said, the experience, the flavours, and the service made it entirely worthwhile, and Barberians will certainly be on my \"visit-again\" list for future occasions worth celebrating."}
{"text":"Despite reading good reviews online, this is one of the worst restaurants I have ever eaten at in my entire life. DO NOT EAT HERE. When we first walked in there was a distinct musty smell. We had just arrived from Nordstrom with fresh full cups of iced coffee and they proceeded to demand that we were not allowed to keep our drinks. For an appetizer I ordered the French onion soup because of another review declaring it as \"the best soup ever.\" However, when I dug my spoon into the cheese, I quickly realized it was spoiled as creamy curdled cheese oozed from it. Our waiter and the manager were both extremely rude. The manager never even came over to apologize for the incident. Afterwards I felt ill so I went to use the bathroom and it was filthy with flies everywhere. When our waiter initially took our order he asked my mom how she wanted her steak cooked. She said \"either medium or medium well.\" To which he responded that he could not do either as it is previously prepared rare by the chef. He suggested that he would ask the chef to cut it in half and double cook it. He continued to argue with us for 7 minutes about how a steak is properly cooked (when he clearly had no idea). When she received her steak it was extremely over cooked. I travel and eat out frequently and this has been by far the worst meal I have ever had. The service was terrible, the atmosphere was old, dark, and dirty, and the food was lousy. The prices are ridiculous for the quality of the food and service that you receive. My mother and I also noticed that all the staff were men. We did not see one woman working there, which seemed inappropriate. I hope this review helps inform people of one place not to eat. I am shocked that this restaurant received such good ratings."}
{"text":"I cannot put into words how well worth your money Barberian's is!! From free coat check, to exceptional service all night long, the overall ambiance/decor, and above all else,  the food!   Despite hearing soo much hype about their Rib Steak, I personally do not enjoy the marbled texture of this cut, and opted for a 10oz NY Striploin. My boyfriend decided to go for their legendary Rib Steak. While ordering our entrées,  we were provided with a basket of garlic bread, and a plate of pickled veggiea, both of which were delicious!   The entrées arrived, and I couldn't have been more pleased with thw appearance,  and with the idea that I was about to eat haha! I ordered a baked potato on the side, where the waiter returned with a separate tray to add sour cream, bacon bits, and feta to my potato (never in my life had I heard of feta on a baked potato,  but lemme say, I will never eat a baked potato again unless it has feta on it!). My boyfriend upgraded his side to their mashed potatoes. Our first bite in and we instantly fell in love with our food.....I don't know how else to say this other than, EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT!!!  Truly the beat steak of my life, best baked potato, best experience in a steakhouse!  Even though we were both ssooo ssoo full, we decided to order dessert, and went with their hot apple beignets. They were nice enough to realize that we'd be sharing the dessert and separated it onto 2 plates for us. I cut into it, and steam was released from the pastrt....is there any better vision in life than a fresh, hot dessert?!?! Scoopes it up with some vanilla ice cream on the side,  and finished it within a couple minutes,  needless to say, I had no regrets ordering dessert!  I must say, this was the greatest dining experience I've had in a while, possibly in my whole life! Although,  yes, it's pricey, it was worth every penny (and that means a lot coming from me as I usually am always looking for a bargain hehe). If you have a fancy/special occasion and need a place to celebrate,  or if you just want a reaaallll top quality meal, please do yourself a favour and dine here!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance in here, the cost check, the low-lighting, the separate rooms and everything. I had the 12oz. bacon-wrapped filet mignon with rice. It was very good, just not worth the $64.00 I paid for it. The unlimited pickled vegetables and warm bread to the table were a nice touch as well. What's really cool are the paintings and different memorabilia hanging on the walls. This place it really unique and I really liked it. Compared to other steakhouses I've been too, this one is okay. I likely won't return, but please give this place a chance."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner out with friends last night. I had been to Barberians a few years back and was not surprised to discover little had changed. This place originally opened in 1959 and I'm pretty sure it looks exactly as it did back then. This place is very old school and you can immediately tell they have a lot of \"regulars\" -- people hug and high five as they enter and the guy at the door was clearly born to be a host. We had a reservation but we were a bit late so we were held off to the side for a few minutes. I would strongly recommend a reservation on busy nights unless you enjoying standing in a hallway trying to stay out of everyone's way.   We were seated quickly in a charming booth but it wasn't in the \"main\" room which seemed a bit more entertaining. The server arrived quickly and water, bread and a plate of pickled carrots and pickles were on the table in no time. Our drink order was taken and delivered fast.   We didn't order wine but the wine menu is huge almost to the point of being overwhelming. My friends took the waiters suggestion and ordered the house speciality which is bone-in rib eye. I ordered the NY strip. Both good choices but my friends was not cooked exactly as ordered which resulted in us receiving free dessert (not that we needed it). I had the Ceaser salad to start while my friends started with prawns. The Ceaser is classic and it won't blow your mind but the prawn cocktail looked incredible. There are non meat choices on the menu but this is a true steak house.   The Steak was the best I've had so far in Toronto. The restaurant is a bit dated and a lot old school but that's it's charm and the food is outstanding as is the service! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner last night at Barberians. Old school steakhouse with a classy vibe. Nice pours on the cocktails and the lobster cocktail appetizer was perfectly cooked and a large portion enough for two. We split a Caesar salad and a 24 oz rib eye perfectly cooked and well seasoned. I had read previous Yelp reviews complaining about the filet . If you want flavor and texture in a steak at any steakhouse go with the rib eye, you won't be disappointed.  Our waiter Angelo was great , very attentive and his attitude was perfect for the night . Try the hot apple beignets for dessert!  Angelo asked us if we needed a cab and he went down the block into traffic to hale a cab for us!  There are some things that are timeless and this place was worth every dollar and hour spent there"}
{"text":"Love this steak house ! Best onion soup and fantastic steaks ! Most importantly, they care about my daughter food allergy. Since their dessert is made from in-house, our server had asked the kitchen to take special care for chocolate mousse cake by using separate cutting board and etc., she was able to enjoy dessert fully. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"For a place that is known for their burgers, you wouldn't expect a person to get sick from eating it. This actually happened unfortunately and when we called to notify them of this, we were dismissed and pretty much hung up on.  I can't comment on any of the other items as we only tried the burgers. However, what I was really disappointed by was the service we received from the staff once we called in to report the issue, no apology. With respect to the burger itself, I have had way better ones, it was not so tasty."}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend here on a Wednesday night, I heard great things about the quality of the meat, sadly that was the only highlight of the meal.  We were seated, without being given any menus. And none of the employees paid any attention to us, until I waved a gentleman down and he gave us menus five minutes later...  We both ordered the ribeye mine with fries and his with rice. We felt like the server was rushing us to order and he came off as if we didn't fit in with the atmosphere of the restaurant. The fries tasted like Swiss chalet fries nothing special.  The season of the meat was too charred, it tasted almost burnt. However the meat was so soft and juicy, quite a shame that the flavour didn't match to steak.   Overall, I would definitely pick jacobs steakhouse over this."}
{"text":"The restaurant was recommended by a business acquaintance and frankly, I've had better. Anything taste good with that much sauce on it."}
{"text":"it's been about a decade since my last meal here and i must say, it's the same mediocrity as i recall.  yes, it's a toronto landmark. yes it's good quality beef.  but for the price, that's just not enough.  the pros: *a.m.a.z.i.n.g. wine list.  one of the best in the city. *no pressure, not pushy, well informed servers *sadly, the brussels sprouts were the highlight of the meal *no pretense  *my ideal lighting concept for a steakhouse--dim and relaxed.  the cons: *food took nearly 1.5 hours to arrive and it was a fairly vacant scene at 5pm *after 1.5 hours, our chateaubriand was overcooked. unforgivable at a steak house. ordered MR, and it was in the centre, but nearly well everywhere else.  the result of a kitchen shortcut, too high temp or inexperienced chef *my manhattan was $30+ (bar rail bourbon and quick-to-melt ice chips) *outdated, outmoded, embarrassing decor (the mouthwash in the loo is ruined by the paper Scooby Doo cups) *White-Out on the wine list. beside a sold out, $800 barolo (seriously?!?)   in sum: if someone is taking you, go.  if you're paying, opt for Black Angus on Bloor West"}
{"text":"Old school steak house at it's finest. We received great service from the moment we walked through the doors. Loved the complimentary pickled platter they bring to the table. My steak was cooked to perfection as was my husband's. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the service. We mentioned to our server that it was our first time there - they brought us out a complimentary dessert (chocolate mousse with a chocolate house). I would definitely go back. We both had rib steaks with fries and we shared a side of the vegetables. We started with caesar salad & escargots. One of my fav steak houses!"}
{"text":"This time we again enjoyed Rack of Lamb with mint jelly and Baby Back Spare Ribs with hot fruit compote. Everything prepared perfectly to our wishes and served piping hot from the kitchen. We started with Shrimp Cocktail and House Salad with to die for house made blue cheese dressing. We finished with an Old Fashion Banana Split, chocolate sauce, blueberries and strawberries with extra whipped cream. Theo, Our server (The head waiter) was attentive but not intrusive and every request was quickly responded to. We will most certainly return again and again. Our treat of the night was the 31 year old Bordeaux 1982 Chateau Clos Fourtet. What a great wine."}
{"text":"One of the very best steakhouse I've been to. The atmosphere is cosy, warm and comfortable. The meat was a huge 20oz bone-in NY strip, cooked exactly how I wanted it, black & blue. The wine list is overwhelming with its 100pages. And best of all, the service from our waiter CJ, was impeccable! He was on point evey single time, gave us great recommendations around the city and even gave us a private tour of behind the scenes of the restaurant, in the multi million wine cellar. It was truly an awesome night. Paid close to $400 for the three of us with cocktails, wine and steaks, tax and tips included. It was well worth it!"}
{"text":"This classic steakhouse has been around for a long time.  I've been a two-to-three-times-a-year patron since 1998.  The quality of meats, the service, the look hasn't changed a bit.  If anything their Rib Steak has gotten better.  Did I mention how great the service was?  Toronto does have a few good steakhouses but Barberian's is definitely one of the best.  Awesome wine list."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend awhile back for lunch. It is pricey, but was it worth it? YES! We both got the 16 oz. Rib Steak that they are apparently famous for - recommended to me by the waiter. I had mine with mashed potatoes while my friend had onion rings (they are huge).  I thought the service was very good but it might have been because we went so early (there was no one there at the time) but I liked that we had the waiter's undivided attention and received such fast service. I was actually worried at first since the whole floor was empty but it was all for naught as I enjoyed my perfectly cooked medium-rare steak. Haha  Note: The washrooms are tiny and the restaurant itself is very traditional in design. Great for family dinners, dates and corporate dinners. They also have a nice private room but be aware of the $$$ minimum spend."}
{"text":"I've had better for better price.  Drinks are well served, and pop-overs are delicious. I would return."}
{"text":"A great steakhouse always do simple things perfectly. Barberian's is just that. The service is superb, however why we went there is for the steak and comparing Barberian's to other steakhouses I've visited, it is definitely among top two if not the best.  I ordered their rib steak medium rare and when it came out - it was cooked perfectly and very full of flavour. As expected, the steak was tender, perfectly charred and shows the correct degree of redness. The chef definitely showcase his mastery and our whole party was thoroughly impressed.  Definitely will come back for second round!"}
{"text":"For one of the priciest restaurants in Toronto they were not the most professional when we walked in for our reservation. However the food met and exceeded our expectations. Probably the best meal I've ever had in my life. I asked for vegetarian options for my wife and they had ratatouille. It was delicious. They also brought out a ravioli because the kitchen made a mistake. My friend and I had the 16oz rib steak. Amazing. If you want a night out with a great steak dinner, barbarians blows the keg out of the water."}
{"text":"What a TREAT. If the finances allowed, I'd return often.  Cool, old steak house interior.  Highly enjoyed the chop steak burger with no bun.  Wait staff excellent. Nice food high when I left.... Best lunch in ages."}
{"text":"Having dined at some of the finest steakhouses in North America, I certainly can't list this one among them.  Not in the same league with the Palm, Morton's, or Ruth's Chris, not to mention tons of great local houses.  Prices are extremely high for the quality of meat served, That having been said, I didn't have a horrible meal and the French onion soup was delicious.  I had the rib steak on the recommendation of the server and was underwhelmed.  Stringy, not really flavorful and certainly not what I would expect for $50CAN.  Wine list was nice, but the prices for the non-Canadian wines was about 25% higher than what one would pay for the same in Manhattan, LA or DC.    All in all, not a terrible experience, nice old school atmosphere, but not worth the money.  If I try again, I'll go for a different cut of meat."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday celebration with my boyfriend and we both agreed that it was decent. No complaints regarding the porterhouse steak and rack of lamb but also nothing out of this world. However, my boyfriend attests that the lamb was amazing and his favourite between the two entrees.  Can't say much about the service considering the fact that we didn't have much of an interaction with our server which was kind of disappointing but whatever -- not much of a deal breaker for me.  Will we be coming back? Probably not. (Actually, maybe just for the garlic bread...)"}
{"text":"Had such a fun experience here last night! I was visiting Toronto and this place came highly recommended and I can see why! I love the old, classic steakhouse atmosphere, feels authentic.   My date and I started with the lobster cocktail - wow! I highly recommend it if you're into lobster. For our main, we ordered the porter house steak for two and some lamb chops - I am not a big steak eater but it was great! I would say the show stopper for me was the lamb!!! We also got a side of mushrooms and asparagus... delicious!   They also have an amazing wine cellar downstairs that you can reserve to have dinner. Great for a large party, but i personally loved the classic, main room! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, huge wine selection and good food. I loved the intimate seating, but still enough space to feel comfortable.  Steak was great, I asked for well done it was definitely medium but overall much recommended."}
{"text":"I really love that old school feeling you get when walking into a dimly lit steakhouse like Barberian's. Not sure what it is, but I just love that vibe.   Six of us went for dinner here recently and I was really looking forward to trying this place. I'd read some great reviews and had been craving a steak for a while. I knew what I wanted before I even sat down. A couple of people at our table had appetizers, but I passed, anticipating that my entrée would fill me up, which it did.   The garlic toast they bring for the table was really good. Fresh, warm, and lightly coated in garlic butter. I could've had a few more pieces but wanted to save room for my main course. The pickled veggies were an interesting addition. Not a huge fan, but I tried them anyway. Some folks at the table loved them, so it's a matter of personal preference I guess.   On to the mains. I had the 8oz. filet mignon with a baked potato and shared a couple of sides - sautéed mushrooms and the golden beets. I have to say, the beets were actually the highlight of the meal for me. The mushrooms were just ok - not very hot.   Sadly, although my steak was cooked to medium rare (as ordered) it just didn't taste as good as I'd expected. I always have very high expectations when I go to a high-end steakhouse, especially when I'm paying over $50 for a steak. The meat was too charred on the outside for my liking, which made the outer edges of the steak too well-done. It ended up being tough and chewy all around the outside. The very middle of the steak was a proper medium rare, but it didn't help the rest of it. One of my dining partners had the same complaint and pointed it out to our server, whose response was basically, \"If you cut into the middle of the steak, you'll see it's cooked properly.\" That doesn't change the fact that the rest of the steak is medium well. Extremely disappointed.   As at least one other reviewer noted, you will get a much better steak at The Keg for a lot less than what you pay here. I would have to agree. I compared a recent trip to The Keg and found that my meal was much better there and my bill was a lot less. Although I loved the ambiance, I won't be returning to Barberian's anytime soon."}
{"text":"The place is on Elm, just north of the Eaton's Centre, in a fairly nondescript building/house. The place doesn't look like your typical haute Steakhouse; one half of the place looks like an old pub, the other half is ever so slightly more fancy. I think the place has a nice feel to it. The room we were in was large enough to seat a fairly big party. There is also seating down in the restaurant's wine cellar, which is supposed to be quite nice.  Barberian's serves steaks -- and a few other things. I don't think there is much point going there if you aren't going to buy a steak. The steak I had was amazing, and I am pretty sure everyone else enjoyed theirs. The price of a meal ranged from about $30 - $50 dollars, depending on the entré you got. As Steak places go, I don't think it's particularly expensive, and I thought what I had was well worth the money. The wine list at the place is something to behold. The wine my friends and I split was quite tasty.  I think Barberian's caters to a very diverse group of people. It didn't have the sort of old banker feel other steak places sometimes have. I could certainly see it appealing to that crowd as well, but at the same time they had no issue with a group like ours. There were all sorts of people eating when we arrived. The staff were very helpful throughout the evening. The owner popped by briefly to wish my friend a happy birthday. I found it to be a very friendly place. On the whole I think Barberian's is well worth checking out."}
{"text":"I love the old school feel of this place.  The atmosphere made me feel like I was a big shot right out of the 30s.  It's a great spot for a date, a night out with the girls or boys, or a fancy reunion with family or friends.    The menu was what you would see at a classic steakhouse.  The prices weren't outrageous for what you got.  While I prefer other steakhouses in the city, this one certainly wasn't a disappointment.  Portions are what they should be for the price, and the steaks were cooked well.  The only thing that was kind of annoying was that the place was nearly empty when we were there.  My boyfriend and I came for a nice date, and we were sat next to two guys that were talking so loudly, it was nearly impossible to ignore."}
{"text":"The restaurant it self is dark and is very romantic, the steak is amazing!  Best I have had in a very very long time.  I was a bit disappointed that there were no fresh veggies.  Not that it bothered me at all I was there for the Steak..   I also had the most delish glass of Spanish wine...  It was just about perfect!"}
{"text":"probably the best steak house in town. Went there last weekend with my girl and it was great. The old school feels make the restaurant stand out from the usual big box steak houses. And of course the steak is melting in your mouth. Good portion too. If you're looking for the best piece of meat and a great environment, this is the place"}
{"text":"Service was expectedly superb.  My steak was perfect.  Ambience is very nice.  Overall I had a great experience at Barberians."}
{"text":"Wow.  Barberian's is something of a legendary spot. It's an old school steakhouse, not the kind of place you find many of anymore. It's not changed much over the years, though I think they've had to adapt a bit to modern era realities (the dress code is less stringent than it was in the past, I think...)  You're here for steak, probably. Really, really good steak, and you're not afraid to pay for it. And you will. This isn't a cheap night out, it's a quality experience to savour. If you're going to do it, do it right. Get good wine. Get dessert. And don't have a heart attack when you see the bill, because it's going to be worth the leisurely dining experience on a steak like you've never had.  Secret tip: creamed spinach isn't on the menu, but ask and the kitchen will make it for you.  If you order a steak more than medium, I'd like to think the staff will throatpunch you.  Also, the pickled vegetables - they're amazing. Best appetizer ever.  They offer an interesting \"after theatre\" lighter fare menu as well, definitely a good option after a show."}
{"text":"For one of the best kept secrets in Toronto, it's been around long enough.  It's been in Toronto for 50 years, and yet some folks that I talk to will still ask me \"Where's that place again?\"  Just off of Yonge Street on Elm, Barberian's is a small family run restaurant that appears to have been built out of someone's house.  Each room feels just like that.  A room.  The décor is rustic and homey, and the staff take care of every whim.  But the chair, table, and the guy who sits you in it is not what you go there for.  It is the meat.  The steaks are typical of a higher-end steakhouse, ranging in price from $28 to $56, but there's a huge variety in the cut and size that you're able to get.  The wine list is, well, vast.  Like the steaks, prices range from the \"reasonable\" to \"You've got an expense account, right?\"  The wines are divided up by region and the list can be staggering.  Ask for some assistance if you feel overwhelmed.  How good is Barberian's?  Go to a grocery store in Toronto (and possibly farther afield) and you'll find their steak rub on sale so that you can take it home with you.  One last thing: Beware of the horseradish.  It's freshly ground, pungent, and delicious."}
{"text":"Not being a Torontonian, I had done a lot of research for a steakhouse for my boyfriend (BF)'s birthday. Reviews for Barbarians seemed good so I made a reservation for 8:30 on a Friday 3 weeks in advance. We showed up at exactly 8:30 with about 3 other couples arriving within 2 minutes of us. We were all told there was about a five minute wait and they gave us some bubbly wine to compensate. BF and I thought that was a nice touch since 5 minutes was not a long wait. 30 minutes later, one pair of couples were seated while the line up at the door continued to grow and we were anxiously, hungrily waiting for our table. The other two waiting couples were seated before us and then around 9:10 we were finally brought to our table by the manager who said \"I will take care of you to ensure a special evening\". We were brought to the worst table in the whole restaurant right in front of the kitchen where you can see and hear everything. We saw another table being cleared and asked to move. The waiter gave us attitude but allowed the change. Once seated we waited another 10 minutes for menus, water, bread and dill veggies. I was driving so I chose not to drink (also high wine prices). BF ordered a vodka (not premium) which we found out cost $13.00. We ordered our meal (shared ceaser salad, filet mignon & NY Sirloin. The salad came out on two plates but we were not offered some fresh pepper. It had a decent taste but was nothing special. About 10 minutes later the food came out (a bit quick for my liking being at a \"fancy\" steakhouse). Bf's steak tasted completely burnt with no flavor so we asked to send it back. Their excuse \"it's charred\". Our response, it's burnt. My steak was over cooked and had zero flavors. Disappointing. Tried to wait to eat with BF when his steak came out but it was taking twenty minutes. The baked potatoes (I asked if I could switch to mashed and was told \"no substitution) were cold and drenched in toppings. We asked for a bit of bacon and the cheese to add flavor but there was more of the toppings than there was potato. The second steak received was not much better than the first. Not once did anyone come to ask how the food was or if it was better. Halfway through the eating of the steaks I realized our water had also not been filled in at least 15 minutes. I kept trying to get a waiters attention but kept getting ignored to the point where I went to the bar to get my own water. We were so disappointed. I had also called the day before to remind them it is for a birthday for the gentleman I will be with. They did bring a \"cake\" at the end which ended up being the apple beignets. They basically throw it on the table and mutter happy birthday. They also gave it to me instead of my boyfriend even after clear instructions. The dessert was also disappointing as it was not a donut but an apple shaped as a donut with way too much cinnamon. The bill arrived without being asked if we wanted tea or coffee or anything else. I noticed that the steak was not removed from the bill which would have been a nice touch. Everything, including the dessert was charged which I was upset about especially after our horrible experience. The manager never came to see us or ask how the meal or evening was even though we noticed him schmoozing with other guests. We were certainly not \"taken care of\" as earlier told. At this point I decided to tell the manager about our experience. I started with \"I will be paying for this meal but this is what happened and why we had a negative experience\" and before he even let me continue he took the bill, said don't pay, don't come back and please leave. What terrible customer service. Not only will I never go back but I will make sure no one I know or ever speak to goes there either. The birthday meal was completely ruined. Other than the pickles we were utterly disappointed and have nothing positive to remember from Barberian's. For the price you are better off going to the Keg (less money, better service and way better food) or spending more and going to one of the nicer steakhouses like Ruth Chris, Morton's or Jacobs. Stay far away from Barberian's unless you want an evening of annoyances and disappointment."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot if you like upscale dining experience. Also pretty decent for a place to take your date to. Be expected to spend at least around $100 for two ( after tax and tips)  The ambience is dark and very private, quite upscale. Waiters are all dressed up, also they are mostly elderly.   Food are expensive, but expected for a place like this. Me and my boyfriend had their salmon and chicken dinner, they comes with baked potato with sour cream- very good.  They have good selection of wine, the most expensive wine on the menu can go up to thousands."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my wife on our last night in Toronto. Service was very slow and the restaurant was not busy at the time. There was no atmosphere in the place. Many staff walking around. Wine list is massive and very pricy.  Had a bottle of Malbec from the house wine selection. Ordered steaks and a side dish of onion ring. Waited over 30mins for the food. Side order was not delivered and waiter didn't even realise his error. When I checked the order with him as we finished dinner, he confirmed that we did indeed order the side. No apology offered.  Bottom line: food was good, without being spectacular, presentation was average. Price was over the top but I guess you're paying for the name of the establishment. Won't be rushing back the next time I'm in town. I'm sure better value and dining experiences can be had locally."}
{"text":"The steak is good, but for the money (expensive!) I expected more.  We went here for my birthday and I ordered NY Striploin while my girlfriend ordered pork chop.  The striploin was quite good, but I've had better at Morton's (aged!) and for less money.  The pork chop was quite dry and definitely not worth the price.    We(I) dropped hints throughout the dinner that it was my birthday, but the server ignored it.  Would it have been too much of an expense to offer a free slice of cake with a candle on it???? Come'on! Finally my girlfriend ordered a flan dessert and asked them to put a candle on it (and paid for it).  Great location, good (not amazing) steak, but for the money, one could definitely do better around Toronto.   The pickled vegetables were a nice touch, but not enough to salvage the rest."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment!!! For a Toronto \"steak institution\", Barberian's didn't live up to its hype or old glories.   It all started out well. We entered and were greeted with an old-time steakhouse vibe: wooden panels, muted lighting, pristine table settings, and buttoned up servers who were really attentive. The table garlic bread was tasty (if you're the type who likes it on the garlic-y side) and the pickled vegetables had a refreshing taste.   Then we got to the appetizers and entrees and it went down from there. We got: - Caesar salad: Average at best. Leaves were a bit too soaked in the dressing, and the dressing wasn't even good! - French onion soup: The exception, since it was outstanding. There was A LOT of cheese and bread, which we loved - Top sirloin steak: Again, average at best in terms of the taste and how well it was cooked - I didn't even finish it! I won't go as far as the other reviewers who say the Keg is better, but definitely nowhere near what you get at Jacob or Hys - Ribs with baked potato: Really bad! The meat was tough and didn't fall off the bone. The ribs you get at Baton Rouge are waaaaay better, and that's not even accounting for how it's 1/3 the price!  The dessert kinda ended the meal with an upswing, as the housemade ice cream (chocolate with Jack Daniels) and chocolate eclair were both good. That said, they weren't enough to save the meal.  Maybe a decade ago this was the place to be when there weren't enough choices. Sad to say but, save for the French onion soup and the nice decor, it looks like time and tastes have passed Barberian's by."}
{"text":"Always a great choice for steak.  Cooked to perfection. Great atmosphere... makes you feel like you are in a tavern in Europe.  Had a celebratory meal here and we were taken care of very well!!  Bonus: their jumbo shrimp is huge!!!!"}
{"text":"Barberians is definitely a throwback to another time. Outside of exclusive clubs or the occasional old house or building, few places in Toronto evoke a sense of history like Barberians. You get the sense that this is a place where deals have been made and romantic dinners held for years... Since1959 to be exact.  That being said , here are a few pros and cons....  1. The service, which they purport to be great on their menu, basically lives up to billing, but has slow moments. The supporting cast is quick with water refills. 2. There is no cocktail menu. Tell them and they make it. Not sure I like this. 3. The steaks are excellent. I was underwhelmed by the seafood chowder, which was under seasoned. The baked potato was standard. 4. The clientele are diverse. You get the sense that lots of different people from all walks of life enjoy coming here to spend money. That's nice. 5. Prices are high, but not out of line for Toronto steak houses. 6. The wine list is extensive. 7. The place has charm, but lacks a sense of elegance. Two quibbles... The bathroom was not clean and the candy (free at the exit) had wrapped candy mixed with loose jelly beans in the same bowl. Not major, but when you are easily a 100$ a person place, these things matter.  I enjoyed this, but was not sold that this is the place I will return regularly for steaks.  It is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried to remember when we were last at Barberians, maybe 20 years ago, but it doesn't matter since the restaurant hasn't changed a bit.  However, we seem to be on a mission to find the best steak in Toronto and despite staying at the Hilton with Ruth Chris beneath, we returned to Barberians because of the glowing diner reviews.  We were not disappointed.  The rib steak was probably the best I have ever tasted and my wife's prime rib was equally superb. Splitting a Caesar salad was a good idea since it was done in the kitchen and each half filled a plate.  The frequently mentioned dill pickles+ and the warm garlic bread a nice touches.  Service was attentive, friendly, and provided good wine recommendations.  In keeping with Canadian tradition, the alcohol prices are outrageously high, but otherwise the quality of the food and preparation was worth the price for a special occassion."}
{"text":"Had dinner here our first night in Toronto.  Bread was fresh and warm. The pickled vegetable plate was not that tasty, unless you like pickled vegetables.  The French Onion Soup was loaded with cheese. The broth itself was a little bland, but the gobs of cheese made up for it.  The 24 ounce porterhouse was well worth it, as was the petite filet mignon wrapped in bacon. Both came as ordered, medium rare, with a baked potato. Good stuff.  For dessert we shared the hot apple beignets with vanilla ice cream. Aces."}
{"text":"My date brought me here for Valentine's Day dinner. As soon as we walked in, I knew it was going to be magical. Someone who seemed important, maybe the owner, identified our reservation and made us feel at home. The free coat check was a plus and the girl was so sweet. The first thing we see at the table is the novel length wine list. The range was incredible. Not long after a sommelier came to the table, asked us our budget and tastes and then let us try a few wines before settling on one that was perfect for us and our meal.   We both ordered steaks, her the filet mignon and me the rib steak. We both asked it be prepared medium. I feel hers was perfect and buttery. I wish I ordered mine medium rare as it was a little too tough for my liking. The sides were the fries that came with it that were well done.  For dessert we had the apple beignets with ice cream. I thought it was presented well and yummy, but definitely not the traditional beignets I was expecting.   During our visit we witnessed a proposal and met a man who had two gigantic Spurs championship rings. He let us try it on and take a picture. I wish I realized at the time I probably should've taken the photo with him and not the ring. :P   I would definitely go back. Was a magical experience. Next time I will order the filet and/or ask for my steak to be prepared medium rare as to not make the same mistake."}
{"text":"Barberian's has a great atmosphere and very nice and professional servers. The food is very good and portions are a descent size. The baked potato and French fries are both a great side. The pickled vegetables in the beginning are a nice touch. We had the steak and chicken, they were both cooked very well. The apple beignet's dessert is delicious! It tastes fresh and light. Great restaurant for a celebration."}
{"text":"Barberian's Steakhouse and Tavern is by far one of the most amazing steakhouses I've been to...anywhere. I ordered the 12 oz fillet mignon and it was worth the price! Service was stellar and the selection of wines, cigars, and liquors was over the top. I would definitely recommend Barbarian's for any special occasion!"}
{"text":"I am a huge steak fan and frankly this was not up to the mark. My medium rare ribeye definitely did not qualify as prime.   Wine was very good and the service was excellent. No doubt about that.   I really liked the people, decor and the overall ambience. I would have definitely gone back but for the so-so steak. I hope they improve."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary on Saturday night.   We originally had reservations at 8pm, but we moved it to 9pm. We called it in around 6:30 and they were very accomodating.   *Observations: Timing is everything. If you're coming from out of town and driving, parking is very tough in this neighborhood. Barberian's offers valet parking, BUT if you're there as people are leaving AND park after 9pm, you just might find some FREE parking. Like I did. =D  We were seated quickly in a corner of the restaurant at \"Barb's Table\". At first, it spooked me, but then I thought it was pretty cool. The owner's table! What up! They brought out garlic bread and an assortment of veggies (carrots, celery, pickles). The bread was hot and buttery. So tasty (and oily). It definitely held us over till our appetizer arrived.  Appetizer: Coquilles Saint Jacques: Scallops baked in mashed potatoes and covered in cheese with a creamy dill sauce. Oh my goodness... It was delicious. Served in a shell-shaped dish, it was a little hard to handle since it kept rolling.  Entree: What drew me to Barberian's as opposed to other steak houses was their \"Chateaubriand for two\". It's something of an anniversary tradition for us. Anyway...It was a great cut, but it lacked the tableside service \"wow\" factor. Served with grilled veggies, a sweet potato puree, baked potato (loaded to your liking), and bearnaise sauce.. and that was it. I definitely had high expectations, and it didn't help that my first bite was almost inedible with how hot and spicy the horseradish was. You've been warned!  Drinks: While the wine list is the most extensive I've seen in Toronto, ordering just one glass still sets you back. Ordering a bottle... too baller for my budget. I ordered a coke instead & I got a small bottle. It was tiny!! And there were no refills because it came as a bottle.   Service: We were a little confused at the beginning of the night. We were seated by one person. We'll call him \"#1\". Another person, #2, took our drink order.  Another person, #3, came to our table a minute after our drinks were ordered to take our food order. We weren't ready, so person #2 came back a few minutes later. Person #2 brought the apps. Person #3 served the entree tableside. Then another person, #4, came by with horseradish & toppings for the baked potatoes. Then Person #3 got us refills of water and got me another coke (and actually brought be a Diet... wrong order...). At the end of the night #2 cleared our table and #3 gave us the check. Are you confused? Lol. Then, as we were paying the check, #3 struck up a quick conversation w/ my boyfriend about baseball and showed us his iPhone where he watching a baseball game. Really!? Maybe that explains the Diet Coke that ended up in front of me... All-in-all, they were attentive, but didn't seem very organized. It was getting late, so maybe people were just looking for things to do. Eh, idk.  My experience at Barberian's wasn't spectacular, but for an upscale steak house, they've got quality. It's not the most expensive house in town, but it's still on the pricey side.  Not sure I'll be back. There's a lot to explore in the city."}
{"text":"Great classic steakhouse Nothing fancy just simple and tasty   Experienced waitstaff, great wine selection  I had the rack of lamb, great choice and you can't go wrong. Defiantly a great size portion   The choice of food is not massive but the simplicity is all you need. The classic cuts of steak in different sizes for your needs cooked to the way you want it. One steak came out to bloody and they gladly took it back and cooked it the way we wanted it.  The baked potato was great which they bring to you plain and the staff load it up with a choice of sour cream, bacon and cheese :)  The price point is high, the decor is old school and traditional - if your into modern design it's not a place for you. It's a classic place to get a great steak and you know what to except if location and a high price point.   Was busy even on a Wednesday night at 10pm  Top 5 steakhouse in TO for sure"}
{"text":"It's good and it's expensive. If you're not going for the astounding wine list, go to the Keg. It's better. If you have a barbecue, a good butcher shop and a bit of experience you can grill a far better steak. The fois gras terrine was very, very good mind you - but again, over priced. You're not going to be impressed by the value for money here. two people, two 16oz. rib steaks, one starter (fois gras) and one pint of Wellington (delicious) and one bottle of Penfold's Koonunga Hill was $210.00"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. This is definitely a place to go for a special occasion. It's the experience you're going for - between the decor, the service and the food, it's all around great. It's a steakhouse established in 1959, the decor is old school and dimly lit, the service staff is smartly dressed. So note this ahead of time before you go and then complain about it after. If you want modern, go to Chop, The Keg or Jacob's.   The decor is dated and probably is similar to the original decor when it first opened, if not it is still the same. It's extremely old school, which we thought was really cool. Note that our resos were at 7:30pm on a Thursday (I made them the same day around noon) and I watched throughout my meal as the place filled up to the point that every table had been sat. So you for sure need to make a reservation in advance.  We ordered a bottle of wine (not a particularly expensive one, but also not a cheap one) and two 8oz fillet mignons wrapped in bacon (the side was actually included: baked potato or rice) and there were options to get an accompaniment as well. We stuck to our guns and got the steak and baked potato and left it at that. The 12oz would have been too much for me, and my boyfriend insisted that he didn't want to be uncomfortably full, so we both got the 8oz. He also ordered a caesar salad to start, which was a sizeable portion. Had I wanted one as well, we could have shared.  Prior to the meal, they gave us a basket of garlic break and those famous pickled veggies that every other review for this place touches on (they really are tasty, and a nice added treat).  My medium rare steak was spectacular. By the time I had worked my way the centre it practically melted in my mouth. It was wonderful. The baked potato unfortunately was too much for me to finish (I'm a small girl), and a service staff came by with fixings for it (sour cream, bacon and feta cheese) to add to it...I obviously went for all of it. He wasn't stingy about adding fixings either.   Our server was really great. He didn't rush us, made sure we were okay with everything on the menu, let us be after our meal so we could finish our wine, and noticed when we finished our classes and promptly came over to see if there was anything else we needed (we passed on dessert because we were pleasantly full). At the beginning I mentioned that it was my boyfriend's 35th birthday, and he brought him Barberian's steak spice in a pretty big jar as a gift. Which was so cool! I assume his dessert would have been comped. if he ordered one.   With tip in total, I ended up spending about $235.00. We really enjoyed it, we don't go out to expensive places often, so it was a really nice treat."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the worst steakhouse experience I have ever had. Both the 12 oz filet and the ribeye were chard on the outside and rare in the middle when the steaks were ordered medium rare.  Server was never around and the food took forever.  Finally they just took the plates away.  I left hungry and had to go find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Very friendly family like restaurant. We are greeted right at the front and inside they have concierge to put away your coats. The restaurant is very traditional and stylish. Waitors are quite arrogant, but relatively good manners. All the dishes are very pricy, some are tasty and some are just ok. Restaurant is rather small and tables are crowded together. The steak might be the best as it is widely recognized, but if you are not a steak fan, you might not tell the difference.  I'd rather go to Copacabana as they have more varieties of steak you can try and they taste better from my point of view."}
{"text":"My first proper steak house. So awesome.  I got the filet, and I've never had two pieces of meat as happy in my mouth as that beef and the bacon it was wrapped in.  The onions and green beans were, themselves, delicious.  Hell, the mashed potato was awesome.   Yes, it is very dark inside.  Stepping out into a late afternoon sun is a very fascinating experience.  But it's so comforting inside.  Somewhat womblike.  I wish I was one of those expense account dbags so I could eat here more often.  As it is, I hope to return in the future."}
{"text":"I had one of the best steaks of my life there last night.  16oz New York Strip Loin - it was amazing ...... I'm still thinking about it! They also made a Perfect Manhattan that was perfection."}
{"text":"Treated my husband to this little gem for his birthday.  Called 2 days ahead and was able to make a reservation for 2 at 5pm for a weekend evening. Reservation is recommended because the place got packed!  The decor is intimate, cozy, and OLD SCHOOL- dim lighting, warm wood paneling, lush carpet, and low ceiling. We were seated in a quiet corner away from the mayhem of the larger parties.   Extensive wine list but most came in the bottle so we went for a glass of basic California cab that paired superb with the rib steak. And for cocktail, the Negroni was DEADLY delicious. Meals start with healthy servings of bread and assorted pickled vegetables (green beans, carrots, olives). We had the escargots and French onion soup that were about as traditional as it gets. Good thing we weren't audacious and ordered the sensible 16oz rib steaks instead (perfectly charred on the outside, pink and tender on the inside), because our pants about bursted at the seams after the meal.  And please guys, get the New York cheesecake. You're probably tired of overzealous Yelpers being melodramatic about slices of heaven, but seriously, this is one of those slices.  Servers dressed in starched white button down shirt and black vest; relaxed and self-assured, ever so attentive and attuned to their customers' needs. No eager beaver, no pompous douche.  Be forewarned, it is an old school, no frills establishment. So if you want glass table with polished chrome under your plates of fancy aged meat from cows that were massaged on a free-range farm served with flashing strobe lights. Stay away. Because this is where I'm coming back for birthdays and more!"}
{"text":"Classy old school steak house. Bday dinner went all out. Escargots shrimps steak wine mashed potatoes crime brûlée.  Dessert n coffee wasn't anything special. But food was excellent. Just a nice old classic men's club feel."}
{"text":"Nothing but first class service and food.  An amazing selection of first class wine.  Loved every bite.   Perfect for special occasions, business meeting, and meat lovers.   The history, atmosphere and menu are both classic and updated.   I look forward to my next meal here it was something very special."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner.  I had the beef filet with asparagus and mashed potato.  Being in canada I had to have HP sauce with the filet.   Service was excellent.   Only downside it is a little pricey."}
{"text":"The ceaser salad was sour. The rib steaks were burned. Basically paid 42 for soup in the end. Never going back. Waiter was rude and unaccomadating when we complained saying that's just how we do things here. Poor busboy was nice.  Sad he works there and not somewhere else"}
{"text":"The stacked baked potato was to die for. And the Steak was quite good. For an experience it's highly recommended but I feel like I just needed to try it once...being the oldest steakhouse in Toronto. Overall it seems to be a bit pricier than most steakhouses and not the BEST steak I've ever had. Would easily be 4 or 5 stars if the prices would drop significantly. $12 for desserts is okay depending on dessert because some are tiny. And $22 for my Old Fashioned drink is a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"4 Stars - Would recommend!  About $90pp including tax and no alcohol.. not a bad price for this type of establishment.  Atmosphere is business casual..  Steak menu is diverse! Fairly priced.. my 16oz striplion was $70.  Porterhouse (more like a t-bone though) was $80..  Items which really stood out were the double thick Pork Chop.  This was really delicious and was only $31. Meat was super tender and super juicy.. really was a highlight and must try if the quality is consistent.  Garlic bread was amazing!!! Perfectly crunchy on the outside and super moist inside!  Steaks were great! But for this type of steakhouse.. you expect it to be nothing less then great.. having said that.. it was average and didn't strike me at amazing...  Winelist is like a telephone book.. we didn't go for anything.. their house bottle was $50 plus and most wines on the list was triple and quadruple digits.. even had a $10,000 bottle available.  We didn't order it, but the beef roast for 2 to share for about $120 seemed like a good deal seeing the table next to us ordered it..  Baked potato and fries were below average.."}
{"text":"Very good steakhouse.  Typical old school steakhouse ambience and service.  Started with six very nice oysters.  For a main, had the bone in large rib eye.  By US standards, not too large, but it was cooked perfectly and had a nice flavor.  I found the wine list light on reasonably priced options, though we did have a very nice Frank Family Zinfindal.  My only disappointment was a side order of sautéed onions, which weren't very good.  They were not caramelized and not even cut well, had big half circle sections.  The steak, though, made it an excellent evening."}
{"text":"Although food is a good quality, the very inflated prices are not justified.  This place is just not worth the expense."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went to this place on our half-year celebration. It's always pretty romantic place where front desk and coat check people would nicely greet to you. And then the waitress would ask you whether you've been here before. We said no but we have seen those food on Yelp:p so we took order and the food was just great and delicious. Food 10/10 Environment 10/10 service 10/10 the price is expensive for students but due to such good environment I think it can be understandable."}
{"text":"two words: pickled cauliflower.   i know, i know... it's a steakhouse, and i should talk about how tender and cooked perfectly my bacon wrapped filet mignon was, how the mashed potatoes was amongst the fluffiest and tastiest i've ever had, but i cannot pass this chance to talk about the pickled cauliflower. The pickled plate of vegetables comes as a starter before the meal, and is absolutely delicious.   the venue itself is beautiful. The second time i visited was with a larger group and we had a private room upstairs, somewhat reminiscent of an old english style library, accented with brown leather arm chairs in the corners and shelves of historic looking books. very romantic, actually.    the service was also excellent, from coat check, to the waiter, everybody was full of smiles and very pleasant.   I personally love this place. It's good for a group to enjoy a classy dinner and an even better place to share a romantic evening with the significant other.  oh, and their wine list is fabulous!"}
{"text":"The NY striploin was tasteless and was not made to order. I asked for medium well and got rare instead. Fries were soggy. Will not be taking friends here again. Will be trying Ruth's Chris steakhouse instead."}
{"text":"I loved it!!! The only thing that I didn't like was their system regarding reservations! Otherwise, it is one of the best steakhouses I ever visited."}
{"text":"Best french onion soup I've had in my life. If you love yourself a creamy bowl of onion soup, Barberian's is the place to go.   The NY Strip Loin was disappointing - it was tough and completely over cooked for medium rare. I was shocked at how poorly cooked my steak was..since it's a steakhouse.  The frozen chocolate eclair was mediocre, like the steak, not something I would ever go back for."}
{"text":"Very generous portion sizes, tomato salad was delicious with balsamic, lobster was bigger than my head and the baked potato was perfectly cooked plain. Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive"}
{"text":"For great steak, it just doesn't get any better, with the added bonus of one of the best wine cellars in the City.  Old and a tad eclectic ambiance yes, but who cares?   Go for how a steak SHOULD taste. It's Old School to an art!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is absolutely overrated. It was good but not that amazing. I have had better steak at the Keg & my parents bbq (marinating w/ simple ingredients).  The service was excellent but you can tell some of the waiters were very snooty. We did not want to order any drinks. The waiter asked if we wanted regular water or tap water. Is there really a diff? And.. \"just water? No drinks?\" umm yes have u seen the menu? First of all... the prices were sky high. Sorry I'm cheap and don't like spending a ton of money when it's pretty much going to come out of my @$$.  We were given some pickled veggies and garlic bread as a starter. Who needs to order an appetizer now? I did not like the pickled veggies as it reminded me of the summer decades ago whilst working at a pickle factory lol The garlic bread was amazing though. Huge basket too.  I ordered the Filet Mignon 8 oz. It was $45 ! oh damn 1 bite = $4 etc. It was nice & tender but it only made me remember how much better it was at the Keg. I had gotten it medium rare (told them closer to rare) and it came out perfect !  The bacon they used to wrap it in was imho a bit too fat. But what did I expect? it was bacon after all. My hubby's ribs were very good as well. But he mentioned it was a little smaller compared to his last visit. Most of the portions at this restaurant was very big though.  We heard the salmon was excellent as well.   I don't really care about coming back again but it was an alright experience."}
{"text":"Your classic and high quality steakhouse. You can't go wrong.   Wine list is exceptional. Steak menu with both dry aged and wet aged steaks. Surf and turf galore. Appetizers range from huge jumbo shrimp cocktail, coq st. jacques, smoked salmon or escargot.   They've been doing this for a long time, over 50 years, and they know how to have their steaks cut, griled to perfection, and served for satisfaction.  Yes you do pay for the quality, but you get your money's worth. Very Mad Men like. The service is not offensive or snobby, the interior speaks history, tucked away on elm street in an old house, the floors squeak with a story, and there's tonnes of private areas.   I love this place. Over HY's, Ruth's Chris, North 44, this is the place i like the most because it's the same price, with the feel of authenticity, of family specialty, and not of invested corporate money in fancy atmosphere's."}
{"text":"Geez...this review is late.  I haven't been back here for a few years, but definitely one of my favorite spots to go to when I'm in Toronto for biz.  When you first approach the place, you wouldn't think anything of it; small, probably cramped, and OH, it's a steakhouse.  But it was recommended by a colleague when I was in ONT, so I had to check it out.  It was such a great experience the first time that I vowed to come back every time I came into town.  It has never disappointed.  It's definitely the service that makes this place such a high reco-locale, but the food is definitely good enough to come every time I'm around.  My steak is always cooked just the way I want it.  It's steak, so expect to spend more than you would at your avg dinner spot.  But it's worth it.  Parking...can get tough, but there's plenty around close by."}
{"text":"Steak so perfectly done, atmosphere as welcoming and pleasant as can be, exceptional service... It's all like you've come home for a family dinner.  Just because they have vet doesn't mean that it's black tie... So do not think twice.  I'll be a regular here"}
{"text":"One of my favorite steak houses in Toronto.  Very pricey though!"}
{"text":"I have been to Barberian Steak House a few times and am a big fan of steaks so when they say this place is one of the best ones in Toronto, Id have to agree.  It definitely blows Harbour 60 out of the water - food wise!  Place is very cozy, delicious home made pickled carrots and pickles on the table with yummy bread.  The Steak melts in your mouth and the service is Great.  Very nice place...Overall, I give it a 5 star for sure!"}
{"text":"In an Old House on Elm Street, steps away from the crowds at Yonge & Dundas and the limos full of bachelor and bachelorette parties going to Remington's and Zanzibar, is a Steakhouse where you can step back in time.  As you walk in the doors, the mood, lighting and decor take you back to the 50's/60's, when all fancy dinners and power lunches were at steakhouses like this.  If you are a fan of the show Mad Men, this is where a Toronto Don Draper would eat.  To celebrate our 20th Anniversary, hubby wanted steak and chose Barberian's.  He made a reservation, so even though it was a busy Saturday night, we were seated right away.  The ratio of staff to customers feels like 2 to 1 with all the waiters in suits, and busboys in black and white.  The only female staff we saw was the Sommelier, which added to the old time feel.  Having looked at the menu online we didn't need much time to order, the 24 ounce rib steak is what we were there for, and hubby asked for his upgraded to Pepper Steak for $5, which basically means they add peppercorn sauce which he loved.  Between the bread and pickled veggies, and the fact we just ordered 3 lbs of meat between us we skipped the appetizers, which are, of course, all very old school.  Not being heavy drinkers but wanting wine we had seen on the website that our favourite Masi Amarone was offered by the glass but when we got there it was only listed by the bottle. Our waiter said for 2 glasses he would open a bottle which was very appreciated!   That's service!  We did add sides to have with our steaks: Mushrooms, Onion rings, sautéed snap peas (one of the many vegetable choices of the day), all of them piping hot and delicious additions to the steak.  The steak was, of course, the star of the show.  The reason we wanted the thicker cut was to be able to order them to our preferred medium rare and still get that beautiful crust on the steak you can only get at a steakhouse that cook with a bazillion BTU's.  The incredibly helpful and friendly waiter suggested to order the steak medium or medium rare plus, stating for a rib steak if you cook it a little longer the marbling will melt into the meat more.  Sold!  We went with medium rare plus!  The steaks were succulent and tasty and that crust was worth the extra minuscule $11 to upgrade from 16 ounce to 24 ounce... the price per ounce goes down with the bigger steak was how we justified the gluttony.    I had always planned to bring my leftover steak home for steak sandwiches the next day, but had no idea I would be beyond stuffed before I even got 1/4 way through the giant slab.  Hubby was more ambitious and got halfway through before he had to stop.  The waiter checked in several times to see if everything was okay.  The manager (owner?) did as well.  Again this is old school service which is rare these days and makes you feel your business is appreciated.  Being a celebration we HAD to have dessert.  Hubby had \"The House\" chocolate mousse, which is presented in an adorable white chocolate house with dark chocolate roof.  I had the creme Caramel, which I prefer to creme brûlée. Being so full we didn't rush into dessert so these are the only things I took time to get photos of.  Pictures don't do the steak justice anyway.    The desserts were lovely and I couldn't finish mine and the waiter kindly packed it up putting the caramel sauce in a separate cup to prevent possible leaking.  Another example of above and beyond customer service.  Yes, the total after tip took us past the $300 mark.  Yes, the room is dimly lit and moody.  Yes, everything about Barberian's is old school, but if that means quality food and incredible service, then old school rocks!"}
{"text":"I thought I would be giving this place more stars, but maybe it got hyped up too much in my head?  I ordered the centre cut top sirloin steak with potato  and my friend ordered the grilled Atlantic salmon steak dinner with rice. Despite it being a steakhouse, I think I enjoyed the salmon over my steak.  Both were very good, but I do have to give them kudos for cooking that salmon steak perfectly and it paired well with the butter sauce that came with it.  Maybe next time I'll order something more fancy like the surf and turf, which looked pretty good on the table beside us.   Service: good Ambience: good, a little dark Food: good 3.5"}
{"text":"Why in gods name have I not reviewed this place??  I had my bachelor party here, I had my 8 year anniversary here with my mrs, and I had  boys night out here.   This is by far one of the best gems in Toronto and if you have a group of 10 or so, you need to get the private room. Equipped with private server, Private bathroom, private rooftop lounge area, and is just......Amazing. Period.   The rib steak will make your eyes roll back in your head. God....talking about it makes me so hungry and happy at the same time.   You can expect to spend a pretty penny here. But its an amazing steakhouse........  As far as staff, theyre so pleasant and amazing to deal with. I booked via email with a nice young lady... Just great all around.     Its tucked away though and hard to see..."}
{"text":"This place is a steakhouse with history, and as soon as you walk through the door you're reminded of that. The decor is dated but charming; it's not trendy, and it doesn't try to be. The lighting is dim, the wood is all dark and the decor is infused with deep, dark reds. For the most part I found the old design charming but I did get an occasional sense of claustrophobia, followed by an urge to find a window or exit.   I went for dinner with 4 people on a Saturday night. Here's what we ordered:   4 caesar salads: 6/10 - fairly good, but doesn't come close to Jacobs'.  All of the meat was medium rare:  24oz rib steak: 9.5/10 - perfectly cooked! delicious! 16oz new york striploin: 8/10 - delicious in the centre, but overcooked on the ends. 12oz filet mignong wrapped in bacon: 7/10 - oddly salty, not my favourite.   Every order of meat came with a side, so we chose two orders of fries (8/10) and one baked potato (5/10), and then ordered mashed potatoes as an additional side (9/10, but doesn't compare to Jacobs' potato puree).   To finish, we had the cheesecake to split and cappuccinos/espressos all around. We also had two bottles of wine: one barolo and one pinot noir.   Total cost for 4: $550.  It was a good meal, I don't know that I would consider it great. I think it's worth spending slightly more (or drinking slightly less) and going to Jacobs. Or, for the same price or even a little less, Cote de Boeuf, if you're looking for something a little more casual.   Overall a wonderful treat, and i'm glad I tried it. I likely won't go back, though."}
{"text":"Fantastic steak. Great service. Been in TO a long time, and for good reason."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I had not yet reviewed this restaurant after frequenting it for over 10 years.  It is truly a Toronto institution.  This review may be odd in that I will not be reviewing the steaks, which are clearly what Barberian's is known for.  I have ordered steak here many times and I have yet to be disappointed.  Instead, I am going to rave about the salmon.    I just got back from having the salmon at lunch and I have to say that it was probably the best tasting fish and the most perfectly cooked salmon steak I have ever had.  It is so easy to overcook fish but Barberian's is consistent in that the salmon is perfectly cooked.  It is is so flavorful and juicy that I feel like kissing the chef.  The portion is huge and despite my best intentions to eat half and take the other half for dinner, I just couldn't do it.    I would also recommend the brussel sprouts.  Don't be fooled - they are not \"low fat\" as they are fried or deep fried but they are amazing!  Tangy and lemony.  I have converted many a brussel sprout hater with these...  I am usually much too full for dessert but I have tried the chocolate mousse and it was delicious.    The wine cellar (for private parties and special events) is an incredibly unique event space and is very cool!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday because he knows I like prime rib and he looked up this place was one of the better places that does prime rib right. The atmosphere and decorations of this place was quite high end old school style, like back in the 50s? And their menu is basic, a very classic type of steak house.  Prime Rib ($49.50) It was a big cut, probably around 16 oz. I actually found the cut slightly too thick as it was slightly chewy for me although the meat was still tender. The prime rib was roasted just right, they served me a medium rare cut right on. I had fries as my side but it also came with an interestingly shaped piece of bread.  Rib steak 16oz ($54.25) I actually liked the rib steak more than the prime rib - not sure if its because of the way it was cooked but the rib steak was grilled perfectly. I actually really liked the burnt ends of the outer steak, and the meat was juicy. Definitely good quality of meat and was made medium rare right on. The steak came classic too - just strictly the steak and your side without any special presentation or looking like a $50 kind of steak.  Food here is really expensive - but the quality of the meat and cuts were really good. We actually couldn't finish our mains and we had it packed up in the box. Re-grilled the pieces the next day and they still tasted just as good!"}
{"text":"Fancy place.  This was probably one of the best filets I have ever had... there is a good chance I think this because it was a comped company meal.  Anyway, if I come back to Toronto I will definitely pay to eat here again."}
{"text":"When I first saw the menu I thought it was priced a little high. Worth every penny, best New York strip I've ever had. Everything about the steak was awesome. Juicy, melted in your mouth and very flavorful. Even the bread and vegetables they gave you before the meal were good. Definitely try it and ask to see their wine cellar with over 25,000 bottles it's very impressive."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience! Fantastic food and service! Awesome sense of history - if this place could tell stories! Classic old school steak restaurant! Great drinks! Great crowd! Excellent steak - I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I'm a relative newcomer to Toronto, so I didn't know a lot about Barberian's. But, I actually heard about the restaurant from someone back home in Edmonton. After doing some research about popular steakhouses in Toronto, we decided to give Barberian's a try.   We made a reservation for 7 pm on a Thursday, and the restaurant was pretty packed. The interior is quite dark and a bit dingy, with old decor on the walls and lights. It is certainly nothing fancy, but we had an epic meal. The server brought out warm, fresh garlic bread and pickled carrots and pickles to start. The garlic bread was so delicious, and reminded me of something that my mom used to make. I'm a huge pickle fan, so I was really into this. We ordered the shrimp cocktail (~$29) and the escargots (~$11) to start. My husband said the escargots were pretty good, and the shrimp cocktail was just OK. The shrimp didn't seem overly fresh to me. In hindsight, appetizers were not necessary at all, because the meals are HUGE. Me and my MIL ordered the filet mignon wrapped in bacon (~$55) and my husband ordered the rib steak (~$57). Barberian's is known for the rib steak, and my husband really enjoyed this, but I have to say that my filet was probably the best filet I've ever had. It literally melted in my mouth. I ordered fries with my steak (delicious, but could have been hotter), and we also ordered the onion rings, which were to die for. I ate so much food that I couldn't move by the end of the meal. I did finish my steak, but it was a struggle.    The wine list is very extensive, with both expensive and reasonably priced bottles. The service was curt, but professional (exactly what I expected from the place). We will definitely be back, but will order WAY less food this time."}
{"text":"I had to give Barberian's a shoutout. From the moment they showed an interest in honouring their Canadian veterans and current Armed Forces to the viral video of their OWNER manhandling a robber right outside their store (https://www.cp24.com/news/toronto-steakhouse-owner-fights-off-robber-in-smack-down-videos-1.2160508)!  The food is exquisite and the service is impeccable. This is why the price is hefty but you get what you pay for and that's solid service by genuine waiters - an art that's been lost over the years to low cost and fast service that is just \"in and out\". I've had so many food items here from the steaks, to the rack of lamb, to the salads and soups and they've all been to my satisfaction.  But back to my point, if you are military and in uniform, Barberian's will show their appreciation by offering your meal for free. You pay the tip (service fee) and drinks but that's it. Please don't take advantage of this family-owned business because of their goodwill of honouring past and present service men & women. Instead, if your ship is in town, you're here for Remembrance day, Pride parade, or whatnot in uniform - come sit down and have one of the best meals of your life. Arron Barberian and I have met numerous times and he'll make sure to find time to thank you for your service and shake your hand. His staff will treat you with dignity and respect.   My best wishes goes out to the Barberian family and business for keeping the Steak House running and maintaining tradition. They are truly the epitome of Toronto and the hospitality that our great city has to offer."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite restaurant. The atmosphere is just as a steakhouse should be: masculine and cozy. The service is impecable and the wine list is excessive. The steaks - and everything else - are cooked to perfection. There is nothing worse than spending a lot of money on a steak you could have made yourself. Nobody could cook the steak better than Barberian's. The experience is well worth the price. An amazing dinner in an amazing resturant. The quintessential steakhouse."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place a couple times and finally went to try it when a friend suggested it one day. The restaurant was in an unassuming location hidden on Elm street and I had never noticed it before. The place was fairly busy but service was prompt and decent. The ambience was old fashioned, dark, but louder than I thought. I had the filet mignon which was good on all accounts but it didn't quite live up to the \"best steak in Toronto\" hype that I had been hearing. Overall, a good steakhouse and I might come again but it wasn't a home run for the price point."}
{"text":"One of the oldest steakhouses in Toronto, this place has been around awhile for good reason. If you're looking for a classic steakhouse experience, this is the best in Toronto.  As soon as you walk in, you'll notice that this is old school steakhouse to the core. You feel like you're in an old, warm home - from what I could tell they hadn't decorated since the 80s, but I mean that in a good way. It feels warm and inviting - I told you, classic steakhouse!  Your meal comes with their homemade pickled veggies to start - they're very tasty! I also recommend the onion rings. Big, with lots of fresh, crispy batter, but nice and soft on the inside. Perfect greasy way to start your meal if you're not looking to eat healthy but, let's be honest - you're going to a steakhouse, right?  The steaks are always cooked to perfection, and I'm a big fan of the huge dollop of sour cream with bacon bits and feta cheese that come with the side baked potato. They're optional, but I recommend going all-dressed. As far as the meat goes, the rib steak is my go-to, but I also tried some of the fillet mignon as well and they're both amazing. Personal preference, I guess!  Come here, stuff yourself with meat, leave happy. Cool? Cool."}
{"text":"This is the best ever steak i have eaten and trust me i have world wide. The restaurant has the most exhaustive wine list and established in 1959. The decor hasn't changed in all that time and one would swear even the wait staff. One of the few restaurants that employ professional waiters its well worth a visit. An experience you will never forget"}
{"text":"A classic steakhouse. Original menu with a good selection. The steak was good as well as everything else we ate! The ambience was cool, feels like you walked into a time warp. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"An uber traditional steak house if there ever was one, from the dark wooden interior to the old school waiters, you can tell this place has been around for awhile.  The one thing unique about this place is their wine selection.  I believe they have one of that largest selections in the city and you can tell their cellar is well stocked by the massive wine menu they offer.  The service was pretty quick, and I liked the pickled vegetables that came with our bread.   My party started off with a Caesar salad, which  was meh - very standard and neither great or bad.  We also tried the french onion soup, which for my taste was too salty, but did have a good amount of cheese on top.  However, if you're coming here, you're most likely coming to try the steak - which was very underwhelming.  The steaks were seasoned ok, but came out more well done than ordered.  When we mentioned this to the server he looked perplexed and tried to convince us that that's how we ordered it.  We've had plenty of steaks before and can tell the difference between a rare vs medium rare.  The steak came with a baked potato, which was nice and probably the highlight of the meal (at a steakhouse no less).  There are many steak houses around the city, and I would definitely recommend others over Barbarians (especially Jacobs, even if you have to spend a little more)."}
{"text":"After trying Jacob , I've developed an obsession for good steak,  and factoring in so many people raving about this steakhouse ''best in Toronto... one of the best toronto has to offer..blah blah'',  we decided to give into our curiosity and give it a try.    Atmosphere of the place was quite cozy,  it was small,  candle lit with decors as older than I am and portrait paintings like the ones found in Scooby-doo where their eyes follow you around .  I felt like I'm in a haunted house dated back in the pioneer days.  Maybe because I'm quite young,  and the server might've prejudged that we weren't good tippers,  the service we received was way below expectation.  We often had to waved him or other servers down to order, ask for things,  and didn't do his 2-bite check while we were waiting for him since he got the wrong dessert order....  While the table next to us had amazing service and server even insisted he buys them dessert because they were doctors -.-'  When yelpers say they have an EXTENSIVE menu,  they weren't kidding.  12-point, single spaced,  double page,  200 pages long.  After I saw it I didn't even want to bother.   Jumbo shrimp = 4/5  the shrimp were as big as my whole fist.  Served with cocktail sauce,  with a kick,  but doesn't stay spicy in your mouth for too long.  For 27$ an order of 3, not worth the money.   French onion soup= 5/5..  The amount of cheese in the soup is enough to fill you in as a meal.  It was more like French onion sauce with cheese.  I'm not complaining.    Escargot= 2/5  they were really small,  baked I'm garlic butter with mushroom, they were quite mediocre,  surprisingly I've had better in an Asian Cafe,  at least they bake it with cheese.    Ceaser salad: 2/5 Meh.  No bacon?! I'd give it a 1/5 but only giving it an extra point just cus they use fresh Parmesan   K.. Appetizers weren't the greatest,  but let's see what these yelpers rave about their steaks.   16oz rib eye steak : 2/5 rare,  split between 2 people.  The meat was supposedly to be one portion but the two of us couldn't even finish it. It was quite charred on the outside,  not crispy enough tho. After a well satisfied steak at Jacob,  my palette for steak has gotten pretty expensive.  I've learned the quality of the meat makes it or breaks it...  And there is the same ones you find at the keg.    It came with a side of baked potato, which was nice since steak houses usually doesn't come with anything (expect when you go to chain restaurants) was expecting a loaded stuffed twice baked but it came out just regular,  plain..  And the server will bring you sour cream,  bacon that tastes like Jerky,  Parmasean cheese o/s  ''the house'' Chocolate mousse = 3/5  the presentation is good,  chocolate mousse was inside a chocolate house,  but the portion was way to small to charge 10$   This place is over rated.  For the prices they charge,  I was expecting a little more than the keg,  I'd give it 4/5 but since they are more expensive,  my expectations should go up as well.  For those that claims this is the best steak house in Toronto,  spend a little more for Jacobs,  it's worth every penny.    Out of the 3 steak house I've been to,  Ruth Chris,  Jacob,  and barbarian....  Barbarian would be placed last.   Thank you johann r. for funding my expensive palette  :D"}
{"text":"steaks were good and were in great portions. Wouldve liked some vegetables on the side with the steak. The interior of the place could be alot better."}
{"text":"You would not expect this 50's throwback in the busy downtown area! The place is dimly lit, very vintage and the servers are as polite and accommodating as can be. They start you off with this massive book of wines; which we regretfully didn't partake in. Then they bring a basket of bread and pickled vegetables. Delish. Me and my date both got the rib steak. I got fries and he got the baked potato. Oh how I regret not getting the baked potato. Another waiter came by and offered a very generous serving of sour cream, bacon and parmesan cheese for it. But on to the steak! It was tender and so friggin juicy. I love the perfect char on it. I usually don't eat steak but I ate almost all of it. Mind you it was a massive cut of meat. I would come back for special occasions. Pretty pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Warning - I am a high end steak joint regular around the US, so my standards are pretty high.  I had the rib steak which was OK.  Probably a 3 star steak for the price.  It is not advertised how long it was aged for, nor whether it was dry or wet aged.  They did have a special 40 day aged steak for $70.  I didn't think that it would be worth that price.  I had just had a 100 day aged steak in Boston for like $50, and that was the best steak I had ever had.  So the steak was OK, the wines by the glass list had 5 or 6 reds and the same amount of whites.  I was pleased with the selection of by the glass wines.  By myself, so a bottle was to much wine.  Atmosphere was good.  I like old-school steak joints.  I sat at the bar, which was small, only 3 uncomfortable seats.  Staff was 5 star.    First steakhouse I have tried in Toronto, so I can't baseline it to the others.  But I would try a different one next time I come, instead of a second trip here."}
{"text":"Amazing and professional service from everyone at barbarians. I was blown away. And the steaks... Phenomenal! I had a medium rare porterhouse with side mash and my girlfriend got the filet mignon. My steak was the best I've had. I'm a big steak fan, and mine was cooked perfectly. For dessert we shared the beignets. They weren't exactly what we were expecting but they were good. We thought they were going to be like donuts, but they were more like baked apples covered w pastry. I'll be returning, but for a special occasion. It's officially my favourite steakhouse. Oh and also, if your a wine fan this place is for you. SO MUCH WINE."}
{"text":"terrible experience. for the price that we are paying, we've had better steaks in chain restaurants. you can see the look of panic on the maitre d when we came in with 2 kids in tow. our head server was very arrogant. i wish we had the other servers as they seem to be pretty nice smiling at us when they pass by. the lady at the coat rack was pretty nice too.   suffice to say we will not be going back. at least we can say that we have tried once but will not recommend to other people"}
{"text":"Very delicious food.  Slightly pretentious but, I mean, I guess they have a right to be to do food so good!  I had the tomato salad, escargot, and primerib and have no complaints about any. I love the pickles they serve at the start, so crisp and tangy. Also, I love being able to have fresh horseradish with my steak. It's really the little things that sets places in the same category apart and I think barbarians is unique and amazing. The atmosphere is kind of dark but it feels like you are in a different world, like some old school  british underground tavern/steakhouse thing. They also have a wine list as thick as some textbooks. Service was exceptional, attentive but not annoyingly overbearing.  Please go here. You must!"}
{"text":"Great steak! It is a cozy, small restaurant that serves high quality steak. It is pricey but not fancy. You are really going there to get served a good quality steak. Definitely a top choice for steak lovers! btw, the cheesecake is good too. rich and smooth texture:)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here on and off for 30 years.  always a great steak and good service. Old fashoined steak house done right."}
{"text":"Great steaks, I stuck to my usual rib eye and Julia had the bacon-wrapped filet.  Something about pork fat on a steak makes my mouth water!   The ambience was nice, intimate and cozy.  The menu has French influence, so had to try the escargot.  Julia tried the pate maison, wow!  Friendly service, would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The decor is very cool, very rich in history.  I had the prime rib medium rare.  The steak literally melted in my mouth.   If you are in Toronto, definitely look this place up.  It's worth it"}
{"text":"This place used to have great steak and I recently came here with my family and the quality has gone down.  To me you're better off going to the keg. It's cheaper and the steak tastes better.  The only dish that was good was the raw oysters since they were very fresh.  I wouldn't go back anymore."}
{"text":"Out of all the steak houses downtown, this is my favorite one. When you walk in, you feel like you've traveled back in time. Servers are funny and great. I ordered what I love to order, prime rib roast, cooked to a perfect medium rare. Love the accompanying pickles and horse radish. Yorkshire pudding crispy on the outside and a great chewy texture on the inside, everything was on point!"}
{"text":"What a delight!! While exploring the city of Toronto the concierge at our hotel directed us to this steakhouse frequented by the locals and apparently high profile visitors .Honda indy drivers and car owners speckled the eatery. The place has old world charm dark wood,old style lighting. The food was amazing.steaks perfectly cooked tender bread warm soft alot of it.nice wine list. Service by what I saw was a all male wait staff was spot on.dessert and coffee a must.before leaving the bartender gave us several more must try restraunts in town..a overall wonderful dinner. Toronto showed me a great time this was the jewel..Wonder if they realize that?"}
{"text":"Not a great experience after all the hype. Atmosphere not great. Kind of dark and worn.  Expansive wine list with ridiculous price points. Prepare to spend $200 for a bottle of wine.  We found a bottle that we know and like for $170.00. Steaks were average - they severely undercooked my girlfriend's filet, but did remove it from the bill. This place is resting on its laurels"}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday dinner based on some recommendations we had from friends. It was a toss up between this location and harbour sixty.   We've always noticed this location while downtown so we decided to give it a shot first. The decor is pretty classic and feels that the restaurant is quite old with some character. We had reservations and were seated quickly and our jackets left with their coat check.   The waiter was great. Very personable and we got started right away. We ordered a Ceasar salad and French onion soup to start with a few drinks and before long they were there gone and were delicious.   On to the mains. I had a 12oz fillet and my wife had the 16 oz top sirloin. Both were cooked to perfection with the right amount of flavour and seasoning. They also were the right size for the price. It's sometimes heart breaking the price you pay for a small steak but this one lived up to the price!  For desert (yes we still had some room) we had a cheese cake and ice cream. I'd ask your waiter if the deserts are for one or two because their portions are quite large.   My only concern is we wanted to order a bottle of wine and the waiter couldn't get us excited about any. It's far bigger than one would like to be able to shuffle through and pick a matching bottle for your meal.   Having that be my only concern it was a great meal. Not an every day location I'd visit but it's good for special occasions."}
{"text":"After reading few good reviews , I've decided to take my bf to barberian's steak house for his birthday. This place was one of the most disappointing steakhouse I've been to in Toronto. The caesar salad was good but the Steak quality was average. I did not get the value and quality that I've paid for . I would rather go to Keg mansion or Ruth Chris ."}
{"text":"Old men in vests serving primo cuts of cow.   Once upon a time, three lifetimes or so ago, I acted in, and eventually helped to produce, outdoor Shakespeare. It was a wonderful and loved company that lasted over a decade, and it was a huge part of my little life for four years. Once I was behind the scenes (the world wasn't ready for my silly, nasal acting chops), I was let into the Barberian tradition. The super-secret producer and director steak and wine dinner cheersing a good season.   Admittedly, I'm not a huge red meat person. With the exception of some very shameful junk food addictions lingering since childhood, I actually flirt often with vegetarianism. I always ordered a small steak cut, and I appreciate it as being an excellent piece of meat, but I could never finish it. I will, however, shout out their French onion soup, garlic mash and grilled asparagus.   If old school steak houses turn you on and picking your sides one by one to go along with a bloody piece of red meat thrills you, then this red velvet clad gentleman is for you!"}
{"text":"Barbarians serves up classic streak house dining in an authentic setting. Friendly and helpful staff and excellently cooked steaks! What more could you want?"}
{"text":"toronto classic.  order the rack of lamb. its the undercover best dish.  off menu the brussel sprouts. drink martinis.  check the wine cellar on the way out. go back often."}
{"text":"Amazing steak and seafood.  The shrimp cocktail is the best in the city. And those are strong words, but that's the truth. If you haven't had the shrimp cocktail, you haven't lived."}
{"text":"My first visit here. Nice ambience and decor. But at 9 ish pm lots of white background noise.  Neat service.  How was the rib steak I had with house salad as a side?   It was average - nothing particularly bad about it. Nothing exceptionally flood either. Just plain average. It was well done as I had asked. But my friend who had ordered a New York steak also had the same impression. Nothing spectacular and similar to the Keg house.   So in a way disappointing. Expectations of the best prime tender meat  - a juicy steak were not met.  Unlikely to go again. Pricey is fine but only if steaks are exceptional."}
