{"text":"Extremely overpriced.. Crowds were crazy.. I was just happy I got out of this place with my shirt on.. My wallet was almost stolen while I was sitting at the bar.. Customer service was no help whatsoever.. The girls that I saw were not very good.. This place is too ghetto.. Blush is still better, and I don't even like blush.."}
{"text":"This is a bar with dancers, not a typical strip club. You are not close to the girls (the bartender stands between you in all but one spot in the center of the stage) unless you buy dances.  Maybe a good choice if you are going to order a lounge and entertainment to your table, or if you feel like laughing about wadding up dollar bills to fling at the dancer behind the bartender. Good place also to take women who might not be comfortable with a fully naked woman coming close to you or place to show a woman not comfortable with you attending strip clubs what one is like since it's not skeazy.  Oh and sometimes they play games on stage. Look online. That's a fun show."}
{"text":"My first time coming to this club. Had a pocket full of cash. First thing that happened to me is this guy with his shirt hanging out that gave me a flyer. His name is Pete. He gave me this 10 minute speech before going in about he was a paid stern staff member.  That he was also a bodyguard for wealthy people in Pittsburgh. That if I needed a karate instructor he was a black/green belt. Plus his cologne over body odor killed me. Then when I finally got in the girls were older than me. Way older. Drinks were watered down. What a way to spend my first night in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has plenty of strip clubs to choose from, I recommend that you make a better choice than Cheerleaders. To begin, the girls don't even get naked, so if just seeing boobs is your thing, maybe this is your kinda place...then again maybe not. Not very personal at all, the girls dance on a stage separated from a bar area so it's not very personal, and even on the side stages you can't get anywhere near the attention you can at Cricket, for instance, without security pitching a fit that the girls are getting too close. Finally spotted a girl I wanted to solicit a lap dance from but she was pacing around texting on her phone without any care in the world as to her actual job. Finally flagged her down for a $25 lap dance but since I didn't have a ton of cash, just a wad of $1's, she told me it was okay they accept credit cards. So I get a mediocre lap dance, felt her stubby leg hairs rubbing against me (really? Your job requires you to strip down and you're too lazy to even shave?) and go to pay and find out there's a surprise 15% surcharge for paying with a card. Not only that then there is an additional surcharge for using your card, so what's quoted as a $25 dance ends up being $35+ when you factor in a tip (which would have been even higher if this girl didn't totally suck at her job). Seems like unfair business practices to me by not informing me of the true cost I would incur...and unlike most clubs there is not an ATM on the premesis.   If you want to go see naked girls who will show you a good time for your money and not require you to unknowingly get stuck paying for trash, consider other options. Cheerleaders may look flashy and use that to their advantage when promoting themselves as the best club in the Burgh, but in reality it's mediocre at best. $5 for a bottle of beer is highway robbery as well, you're much better off at Cricket where the girls actually get naked and the drinks are cheaper, or Erotica where a $20 cover gets you all the beer you can drink and the girls actually get naked.   They also have a valet only lot here, which on a previous visit resulted in them losing my keys and having to wait 20 mins to get that sorted out. So the second time I parked on Penn in the strip district and walked to the club, only to be harassed by the bouncers for supposedly parking on private business property even though I'm not an idiot and utilized my rights as a citizen to acquire free on street parking. This place is less about service and more about gouging you for every penny you've got, and did I mention the girls don't even get naked? What's the point of a strip club where the girls can but don't take off all their clothes? This place is WEAK and I really don't understand how they promote themselves as anything but. Even Blush downtown lets you park on the street without accusing you of doing something wrong, oh and the girls actually get naked and dance in your face there too. You can put lipstick on a pit and it's still a pig."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin?!?   Cheerleaders is THE PLACE TO BE! Seriously, don't even waste your time on going anywhere else if you're looking for the best gentlemen's club, or even club in general, in the city.   Cheerleaders has the hottest girls. I mean these girls are HOT! Don't believe me? Check out the lineup on their Instagram page. You won't find better looking girls anywhere in the city.   I was also told numerous times to try the food, which I thought was kind of odd at first, but once I got there and saw so many people eating, I felt much more comfortable. I have now eaten there numerous times and can tell you this... Not only is the food spectacular, the kitchen is open until 1am on weeknights & 2:30 on the weekends! The only other food option this late in the area is Primantis and I hate to say this but Cheerleaders food blows Primantis out of the water! Seriously. It's not even a competition! I've had the filet, which is an unbelievably good filet, not to mention is under $30! I dare you to find a filet as good as this one anywhere in the city for that price. I have also had the burger, sliders, quesadillas, chicken bites and wings, all of which were over the top delicious. Again, I know it may seem odd to some, but try the food, you won't regret it!   As far as the complaints of being \"20 feet from the dancers\" let me explain to you what some people seem to be missing here. The two outside bars are specifically designed that way so that you can enjoy yourself, get drinks, be entertained and not have girls in your face at all times, especially while you are trying to eat! The middle stage is where you can sit down and get \"up close and personal\" with the dancers. I find it hard to believe anyone who has actually been to Cheerleaders did not pick up on this...? I have been to other gentlemen's clubs in the city where you are either sitting at the stage or you have to stand. No thanks... I'm also pretty certain it wasn't their intentions to have people \"throw money\" at the dancers but people started doing it and it just stuck. I believe someone else's review touches on this.   They also offer a full cigar bar, shuttle service and have around 15/20 tv's so you will never miss your favorite sporting event. They also show all the big fights on HBO/PPV I'm the club!   Another huge thing that needs noted is when you use your credit card here it DOES NOT show up as a gentlemen's club! It shows up on the receipt as a restaurant (so no need to worry about that \"meal\" showing up on the company card as anything else )   Overall I have zero complaints about this establishment. The owners walk around and make sure everyone is happy and having a good time, the staff is extremely friendly, tentative & good looking, drinks are always full, and everyone is always smiling. Just writing this review has me wanting to go back!   Do yourself a favor and go check out Cheerleaders for yourself, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Nice shapely ladies. Will be a patron of again."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. Girls are far away and you have to crumble dollar bills to throw at them. So, no interaction. Girls are NOT completely nude. Wtf?! Want nude, go in back and pay $450 an hour! Rude rude rude bartenders! And extremely homophobic. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Nice adult club for singles and couples . Typical pricing . Ask for Deja for a private dance . She is the best ."}
{"text":"This was a chill spot away here to watch the Mayweather fight but the drinks were watered down. I like drinking peach Ciroc straight so I know want to drink his water down and I had a couple of them and didn't even feel it. If they rip you off on the drinks I have to get this spot a low rating."}
{"text":"I broke my collar bone throwing a $1 bill. I now can relate to NFL QB. 20% fee for cash withdrawal... and the cigars. Fn weird spot. Titties were avg. Avoid this place. Go to Primanti's instead. Yes... the sandwich spot"}
{"text":"Your flyer passer outer Pete Silverman wastes your company's time harassing people on Twitter on his flip phone while \"working\" He is dumb enough to be such a dick to people, then share where he \"works\" so people can report his behavior. I can only imagine the things he says to your customers and dancers."}
{"text":"Cheerleaders. Woo!  Anyway this was my first ever time to a strip club. Yep strip club virgin over here. Hello! Anywho upon entering expect to be given a metal detection. No ones doing anything stupid.  The inside of this club is huge. 3 stages for dancers but if you're not good with the aim you'll be fumbling trying to give your favorite dancer a nice tip. The bar itself seperates the patron from being too hands on with the dancers. Which I think is a great idea. I've seen too many movies where patrons get a little too grabby. There is a loop hole though for those who want to get up close and personal. In the middle of the bar there is a VIP section where you can sit and get REAL close.   The drinks are extremely overpriced but eh if you've got money to tip the dancers you've got money to spend at the bar.  During my visit I met a few of the dancers and they are really sweet and funny. Plus those girls know how to work a pole or two. They've. Definitely got some tricks up their sleeves..   Tessa M. and I may definately be heading back lord knows I owe her.   Check Cheerleaders out for $2 Tuesdays. I don't know the specifics but generally anything that's $2 is cool by me."}
{"text":"Get ready to have cigar smoke blown all over you!   Most of the entertainers are past their prime. This can get unnoticed because customers sit so far away from the stage that they have to ball up bills to be able to toss them on the stage.   Lacy the bartender did a poor job keeping customers drinks coming."}
{"text":"Last Friday night my daughter, her boyfriend, my girlfriend and I got together for a bar crawl in Market Square with the good people from the St. David Society. We were at the fifth bar of the crawl when my girlfriend got a text from my daughter-in-law that read, \"We're at Cheerleaders in the strip now. Don't ask, just come on down.\" I don't know about you, but when my girlfriend and my daughter-in-law both suggest that I should join them at a strip club, well, I say, \"Sounds like fun for the whole family!\"  I'm not in the habit of visiting strip clubs so I was not only surprised by the $10.00 cover charge but also by the thorough pat down and wanding that we each had to endure to get into the place.  Once in, I located my son, daughter-in-law and a few of their friends at the opposite end of the club and we joined them.  Beers were $7.00 each and the dancers were on three separate stages with a ten foot moat of a serving area between them and us. No placing of a tip in the garter at this place.  People were throwing crumpled up bills onto the stages.   The interesting observations I can make on the girls is that there were a lot of them. We didn't see the same girl on stage twice while we were there. And there seemed to be two types of girls: the smoking hot and in really good shape college girl working her way through nursing school and the dead eyed, covered in tattoo girl that you can only imagine was raised in a disastrously abusive and shitty home and is destined to end up dying in a trailer park meth lab explosion.  I spent most of the time catching up with my son beings that I haven't seen him in a couple of weeks. But at one point one of the entertainers walked up to me and, after some brief dialog, asked me if I wanted a private lap dance. I pointed to my girlfriend and told the \"entertainer\" that I was with her (my girl) tonight and not interested but I'd be happy to pay for one for my girlfriend... so over she went and propositioned her. My girlfriend politely declined making the excuse that she wasn't dressed for a lap dance tonight.  We stayed at the club for two beers, about 45 minutes, before deciding that we've had more than enough to drink that evening and it would be best to head home."}
{"text":"so much fun! ok,  i've been to strip clubs before, and some really shady ones at that. this one was a little different. first of all, there's three stages. two of them  are surrounded by the bar so you have to throw money at the dancers instead of being close enough to put it in their thong, which if you ask me is way better for them. the middle stage, if you're in a certain spot, you can get close enough to touch but anywhere is at least closer than the other two. there's a lot of space in this joint. granted, the night i went it was packed, but the place is huge.. lots of bar space, and seating. the dancers were really good overall. some i was genuinely impressed with (looks and talent!) and others were about average, but not a single one was really disappointing. the staff are all really friendly too. my only complaint is that drinks are super expensive. a gin and tonic is 8.50 (ok, about average, right?) but a beer is 6.50! i mean, i'll spend my two extra dollars to get drunker and not have as many tips for the ladies! i have heard though, that they have $2 tuesdays, so i think that's probably the best day to go."}
{"text":"This club opened maybe a month or two in the spot that used to be Bare Elegance. I stopped through on my birthday solo because I live nearby.   I never went to Bare Elegance so I cannot compare it to that club. Overall, the decor is very nice, the ladies are very pretty, and the prices aren't too steep-it's a $10 cover to enter and you can get a private dance for $20.   The one major complaint I do have is that the bar and the area where the ladies strip is too far away-you have to ball up your dollars and THROW them on stage.   Overall, I was feel like there are better choices than Cheerleaders. It lacks the around the way feel of the Cricket, and I believe that Blush and Erotica have hotter girls. Also, the near empty venue on a Friday night didn't help my first impression.   Maybe things will pickup in the next few months!"}
{"text":"Got bottle service table and and upstairs vip room. Great time. Bottle service host was on point, attentive and personal. She got us great girls and made the night run smooth. Talent was good all around. Getting up to the vip room was odd, we had to check in and pay each time but not a big deal. Had a great Saturday night!"}
{"text":"If you need to practice your long throw, perfect place to go. Be prepared to ball up your ones so you can chunk them at the less than average strippers. It's a real task. But maybe I'm spoiled by the strip clubs in the south."}
