{"text":"Best boba tea in Arizona. The workers are super friendly. We just moved from LA like a year ago. And we just love this place."}
{"text":"Great price for beverages made with fresh fruit. 50 times better than Jumba Juice and probably the best tea shop to get boba milk tea in town."}
{"text":"DaYoung's tea has the best boba I've hade in Arizona. The boba is soft and chewy. Te tea tastes great. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great boba tea!"}
{"text":"Best tea place in the valley!!!!!!! The tea is fresh and fruity! The Black Crystal is a must try!"}
{"text":"My favorite boba tea place!! Their boba milk tea is made with REAL TEA & MILK instead of powders like other places do. Highly recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"The drink was delicious. Authentic Taiwanese boba milk tea! Definitely recommend! Can't wait to try other drinks. BOGO for boba milk tea till 8/20!"}
{"text":"We heard about DaYung's Tea from a good friend & drove all the way from Surprise to Chandler just to try them out. Hence the large order for 2 people. We had a variety of milk teas & the Pink Beauty. We enjoyed the Green Milk Tea the best, but loved the Pink Beauty!  The Pink Beauty has grapefruit juice, fresh grapefruit pieces, lemon jelly & aloe vera jelly. The combination of flavors & texture in the Pink Beauty complimented each other very well. The only down side is the wait, which was over 30 mins. I would recommend DaYung's Tea to traditional boba tea lovers."}
{"text":"First off they probably the nicest staff I have EVER met. Lovely, clean atmosphere and the price is SUCH a deal for the size and amount of Boba (if you get Boba) offered. ($4.05 for a large milk tea with Boba and the cup is actually full with the milk tea and not just ice.) Going to be my new stop when I want a milk tea and Boba. I got there a few mins early (they open at eleven!) but they let me in anyways to try some tasty samples and wait for the boba to finish. Really glad I stopped by!"}
{"text":"Best boba in Arizona! Seriously haven't had anything more fresh. They brew their own teas, juice actual fruit and even use real taro! I absolutely love taro but every boba shop I've been to around here relies on powder. This was the only place that didn't and you can definitely taste the difference. I ordered the taro green milk tea at 50% sweetness and it was the perfect consistency, not too thick or watered down, just the right sweetness, and overall fantastic blend! The only thing is that having tasted boba in Asia, I wish the boba were softer but still delish!"}
{"text":"Best boba milk teas ever. 'Nuff said.
I got the banana one and my friend had the strawberry. It's all super fresh, nothing like I've ever had before with milk teas. The boba is cooked to ABSOLUTE perfection  I wish I could have one of these in my town"}
{"text":"One of the best boba place around Tempe. I tried around 7 items from their menu and all of them tasted great. The environment is clean and the service is consistently friendly. It deserves a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"DaYung's Tea has the best boba in Arizona. I was in China this past summer, and their style of tea and boba is the closest that I've had to the authentic boba and tea in China. Not only are their prices super cheap and affordable, they also have changing deals every month. Rotating seasonal drinks, different BOGO's every now and then, and they give you a free sample of their current new drink. 

The place is a little small, they have some tables, but in their primetime rush hours (evening/mealtimes), their line can be out the door. And when you're waiting for your drink in the prime hours, it can get pretty cramped inside.

Everything here is FRESH. Taste is on point, boba is soft and has the perfect texture, and they make their drinks specific to how you want it (less sugar, no/little ice). Their staff is also extremely friendly! They call out your number, run to you with a big smile, and hand you your drink every time. 

Honestly, anything you get here is amazing and guaranteed to be fresh because it's actually made of fresh fruit rather than just a powder mix.  Some of my personal favorites are the Strawberry Fresh Milk, and their Boba Milk Tea. 

I've had boba drinks in Tucson, Phoenix, Chandler, Mesa, Tempe, and this place is THE BEST. Seriously. You can't go wrong with DaYung's."}
{"text":"I don't always like those pesky tailored Facebook ads BUT I'm ever so grateful for the ad that showed Dayung's Tea Grand Opening. It changed my life...or more like the location I get my boba fix. 

I wanted to make sure that I had visited the location at least a couple times before I wrote a review. When you enter the store, you are guaranteed to be greeted with a smiling face and a sample of one (or 2) of their drinks. Their menu is designed so that they use fresh fruit and teas; none of that gross powder stuff that other places serve. Hence, if you're looking for taro or thai tea or other flavored drinks, you won't find them here. Everything is made in store and is authentic! They only have what's listed on the menu, and the only aspect that might change your drink from your friend's is the amount of ice an/or sugar. There are only 2 drink sizes (S or L) and some drinks are one size only. 

My favorite drinks here are the Jade Lemon Tea and Milk Tea Boba, both with normal ice and normal sweetness. The Fresh Strawberry Milk, one of their signature drinks, is delicious but make sure to ask for extra blended if you don't like icy texture. My absolute favorite part of the drink is the boba - cooked to perfection and served generously! Soft, chewy and has the just the right amount of honey.
 
Customers are always walking in, no matter what time it is, but there's plenty of seating for everyone! Located on Mill and Southern, it's very accessible to ASU students as well as people who work around here. Dayung's Tea resides in the same complex as Fry's so what better treat than boba drinks after grocery shopping!"}
{"text":"The yelp reviews are all true. This place is as good as it gets. Fresh ingredients, no powdery drinks. Orange beauty is my personal favorite and it has aloe vera in it. I will drive there at random times of the day/week and I usually don't like driving far. Quality service. Quality drinks. The only knock I have is the ceiling fans are installed over light bulbs which can be distracting when hanging out there and socializing with friends; not enough to make this any less a 5-star boba spot."}
{"text":"I definitely give this place 5 stars because of all the times that I have been there, the service was really great, and the drinks are amazing! This is my favorite go to place in town, if you are near the Tempe area. The boba here is great, it's soft and chewy! I always get the green tea macchiato and I highly recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"Love their unique fruit tea drinks!!! Definitely a must try!!! My favorite is the pink beauty drink!!! Very light, fresh and addicting!! Great customer service too!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! Staff is so friendly and goes above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction.

I got a boba milk tea with 70% sweetness. Not the best boba I've had, but pretty close. I'm sure if I had asked the staff to make tweeks, they would have no problem.

Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is wonderful. Their customer service is so genuine and their drinks are amaaaazing! They are very informative and willing to give suggestions too. I like how they use ice chips too rather than ice cubes. Love this spot."}
{"text":"Grapefruit green tea is where it's at! Love how refreshing it taste! I can drink that all day long! 

The pink beauty is my second favorite. I might like it more if I got it alone with no boba. I feel like the tea is so nice and refreshing that adding the boba balls kind of ruined it. Don't get me wrong though, the boba balls are nice and chewy but I feel like it'll be a better addition to a milk tea instead.

Prices here are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is probably my new favorite tea house they have AMAZING tea and boba my kids absolutely LOVE this place I recommend the pink beauty, Jade lemon, or the Assam black tea but the Strawberry fresh milk is great for kids"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out based solely on the great reviews. It did not disappoint! Clean, chill vibe and good service but more importantly great boba drinks.
My 81 year old OG Chinese-Filipino mother gave this place good reviews as well. She always orders taro smoothies with boba when we visit similar joints but unlike many other places who use the purple taro powder (which I think is still good) DaYung's uses real pieces of taro. That immediately put this drink in a league all its own. It has a more earthy, chunky taro flavor but if you're good with that, this is so so delicious!! 
My jasmine green tea was a bit sweet for my tastes but after letting the ice water down a bit tasted perfect! 
My husband got the DaYung fruit tea and said it was good, refreshing and citrusy with chunks of apples, lime, orange and even a cherry tomato. They also give a fork with the drink so you can fish out the pieces and eat them. 
Overall a great experience all the way around. I'd definitely come back if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing selection! The girl who helped me was super knowledgeable about ingredients and very friendly. You have the option of juice, tea, milk tea, slushes, smoothies and can adjust the sweetness levels. Good place to grab and go or sit down and chill for a while. I recommend DaYung's Fresh Fruit tea, it comes with fresh fruit slices and is perfectly light and refreshing. Only been once and already love with this place!"}
{"text":"When any new boba place opens, my friends and I always want to give a try. The place is pretty nice, the service is good. We ordered tomato smoothies, strawberry fresh milk, winter melon... I asked for boba milk tea add macchiato but it became green tea macchiato which is strong and bitter. I guess the cashier didn't listen what I said and I didn't pay attention what she repeated my orders. I had to buy extra bobas to put in. Those drinks wasn't good at all except the winter melon one. My niece liked it. Sadly, we didn't finish all the drinks. 
One more thing, baristas looked like scientists to me because they were measuring the drink and took longer time to make than somewhere else."}
{"text":"I usually don't like fruit drinks since you can taste the powder, but that is not the case at DaYung's. They really emphasize on using real and fresh ingredients. I highly recommend trying the Strawberry Fresh Milk ($4.25). The boba is also cooked thoroughly and not too chewy as expected from a Taiwanese boba shop."}
{"text":"Moved from Los Angeles to Phoenix and have been on the hunt for good boba shops in AZ. Dayungs is the best IMO. Their tea and boba tastes fresh. My boyfriend and I got the strawberry milk with boba and orange green tea. They use real fruit! The price is also reasonable."}
{"text":"I am addicted to their green milk tea!! I've tried many boba places in AZ and this DaYung won.  I got the green milk tea with boba and it was perfectly sweetened and amazing tasting.  The boba tapioca balls are fresh, soft, and chewy. The drinks were reasonable price and the size was good.  What makes them different from other boba places is that their drinks doesn't taste powdered like and fake. They use good and real ingredients!

Good customer service and will be back again!!"}
{"text":"First time here, great atmosphere. Pretty busy store but it prolly cause Thu have great customer service and tea. Will definitely come back when visiting Tempe from Tucson! I ordered the jasmine green tea and my boyfriend had the wintermelon tea. I love how the sugar and ice level could be adjusted to your liking."}
{"text":"Dayung is a franchise boba store from Taiwan. This location is the first one to open in the US. I went when they first opened, and the quality/prices of their drinks have consistently stayed the same. 

The drinks here are pretty comparable in taste to the ones I had in Taiwan. While they are limited in menu items, the drinks here definitely satisfy my dying desire to fly back to Taiwan for a good ???? (aiyu). The drinks overall are on the sweeter side. Some of them cannot be customized in sweetness. 

The service here is pretty good. They can be a bit slow for a boba shop but usually it's not a problem for me."}
{"text":"This place is great! Right as I entered the employees greeted me and immediately poured me a sample of the Jade Lemon, it was fantastic! It was a little too sweet however for me to order a full sized drink of Jade Lemon though, but I would still recommend it to others because it's a very unique flavor that I've never had before (tastes like fresh squeezed lemonade, with a fragrant tea, and honey).  I ended up getting the strawberry kiwi drink with boba balls. The boba here is very fresh and soft. I saw as they made the drinks that they use fresh fruit which contributes to the overall texture of the drink. I really enjoyed it here.  If your in the area you should definately stop by."}
{"text":"Best Milk Tea ever. Its milktea is identical to Phuc Long Milktea in Vietnam. So if you love PL, DaYung's milktea will satisfy your thirst"}
{"text":"I'll admit that I am OBSESSED with their \"Pink Beauty\". This drink is grapefruit based with aloe inside and it is honestly so tasty, but also light and refreshing! I love it so much that I went 4 days in a row there and got my friend addicted to it as well! The service is phenomenal and so friendly. One time my friend didn't like her drink and she asked if she could switch it out with another and they were happy to do so! I'd recommend this place for their signature fruity drinks!"}
{"text":"Finally a LEGIT Teahouse in Arizona. Quality tea taste and great flavors. Not to mention the amount of tea and options they give you. If you don't like your tea too sweet or like less ice, DaYung's got you covered. The portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable. My wife and I have been to many Teahouses / Boba & Smoothie places in Arizona, and nothing can compare to price and flavor. Very clean place and the staff is always willing to help you with any questions you may have. Best Teahouse in AZ hands down. Worth the drive from the west valley."}
{"text":"Wow! First, I'm grateful for the samples offered while I waited to order. The Jade Lemon is a tart treat! 

I thoroughly enjoyed the classic milk tea with boba. I couldn't resist trying the Cherry Tomato Smoothie, which was a shockingly good combo of sweet and savory. As I mentioned to another curious patron, it reminded me of fresh tomatoes from my grandpa's garden. I'll be back to try some of the other creative and unique items on their menu. 

The extra details: the parking lot was busy but parking wasn't a problem at all. The restaurant was very clean and the staff were very friendly! So glad this place opened up.

Update- visited again and was just as impressed. Tried the GuanYin tea latte and found its flavor to be bolder, almost as if steeped longer! Yum! The husband is obsessed with the grapefruit drink, Pink Beauty. 2/2! Way to go."}
{"text":"Da Yung makes the best and most refreshing smoothie drinks with actual natural fruit. The other boba smoothie places around townuses powders. Some of my favorite drinks are the boba milk tea, strawberry fresh milk, and the wintermelon lemon tea with chia seeds. 

The place is clean and small, the customer service is excellent, and the prices are reasonable. I recommend this place.

There is a $5.00 minimum purchase to use your card."}
{"text":"Coming from the Bay Area, there's so many boba shops everywhere. Someone recommended me this place while in the area and it's soooooo good! I had it THREE DAYS IN A ROW! Can you believe that? I've called in the order each time to save time since it's always so busy. The orange green tea is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the grand opening day with friends. It was awesome! Sampled their Strawberry Fresh Milk and ordered that for the kiddos. Husband got the Orange Green Tea and that was super refreshing, but I have to admit the Jade Lemon ice tea was my favorite. We also got the Boba Milk Tea and that was great too. The Boba tapioca balls were perfect and they don't skimp on it at all. Can't wait to try all their other drinks, especially the grass jelly, I saw a bunch of other customers drinking that today. The ambience of the shop was modern new contemporary, very clean cut. Lastly the customer service was exceptionally nice. They asked us how our drinks were since we stayed for a bit. It's definitely a family oriented store, the kids had fun watching them make their drinks. Overall great experience visiting on DaYung's Tea's first day! All the best Kevin and Gina! We'll be back"}
{"text":"The boba is amazing here; it's definitely one of the best boba I've had. Also, the size of the bubble tea is so big."}
{"text":"The best boba shop that I've been to! I bring friends here whenever they are in the area. 

Atmosphere: Casual and very clean. Good for groups of friends but not so much for studying. 

Service: Excellent. It could get busy at times but the cashier is very efficient and tries to take orders as quickly as possible. 

Drinks: Fresh. You can adjust the sweetness and add ins for most drinks. I haven't had a drink that I didn't like here."}
{"text":"This place was really authentic! Really good location, really good teas, and a really awesome atmosphere. 

They had samples of their house oolong milk tea and it was for sure one of the better milk teas I have had. I ended up getting the lemon tea which came with jellies at the bottom. It tasted like an nice lemonade! 

My friend ended up getting the boba milk tea which was really good also. 

I would say the only downside is that they only offer whole milk and no non-dairy options, which makes it hard for people with dairy allergies. 

Excited to try more drinks!"}
{"text":"Fresh juice tea! yummmm.... LOVE grapefruit green tea. There is boba milk tea buy one get one free"}
{"text":"Never have ever been so fascinated by all the drink on a menu. I've tried almost every drink since you get sample every time you walk in, and I have to say their milk teas, regular teas, fruit teas, and smoothies are just so good! I can tell by just one small sip that their drinks are well made, good quality tea and they put effort into making your drink the best. If you're new to milk tea must try their Gualin Latte (sorry if I am spelling it wrong), it is a good beginner drink. Their boba is just right, not too chewy, not too hard. 

Service here is just phenomenal! I've never been a happier drinking boba in my life. Great job Dayung!"}
{"text":"This Asia based cafe chose AZ as it's first North America location. And to me, I think we're pretty lucky to have it. I absolutely love this boba spot because of the warm, upbeat customer service. Probably the best customer experience I had so far in a boba spot. The cashier greets you with samples of one of their many drinks that they have. I HIGHLY recommend the Pink Beauty. It's a grape fruit based drink with grapefruit chunks and ice jelly. It was so good that I got it 3 times in a week. I've never been to such a place so frequently ordering the same drink ever. Though it is on the \"sour\" side as my friends that I have let tried it say. But it is definitely a must whenever I go. The matcha milk tea, wintermelon, and black jelly tea is also a recommendation.

100% CERTIFIED BANGER."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best boba in town. Very friendly staff, fresh ingredients, and perfect boba. I stop by once a week at least. I would highly recommend this place to a boba enthusiast like me."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found DaYung's Tea! They're located in the same plaza as Fry's, and grocery shopping just got a lot less tedious thanks to the addition of strawberry boba tea. I can't wait to go back, the service was very friendly, the quality is wonderful and their price point is reasonable. Check them out, it'll make you're day!"}
{"text":"Great service!!!!! They were super busy but even though i waited 20 min for my drinks, it didnt seem so lomg bc the placed seemed so lively

I tried the wintermelon milk tea..yummmmmmm!!!"}
{"text":"DaYung's is, hands down, the best boba that I have had in Arizona. I've been to just about every boba place in the area and this place tops them all! It takes me right back to a childhood of having boba treats in Southern Cal. 

The space is clean and fresh. Service is absolutely wonderful, and the fresh ingredients really make the world of a difference in a drink! Try the Fresh Fruit Tea or the Pink Beauty for something sweet and tangy. Their regular milk tea is pretty darn good too!"}
{"text":"I came here on the advice of friends, and it lived up to the hype!! After a day of hiking at South Mountain, DaYung was the best way to feel refreshed and take a break :) 

I ordered the special -banana milk tea (regular sweet w boba!), and also got to try the taro green tea (50% sweet w boba), and GuanYin latte (50% sweet w boba). I think the taro might've been my favorite!! My bf, who doesn't like sweet things, surprisingly loved the banana milk tea.. we ended up trading because he liked it so much!

The inside is cute and clean with lots of seating -it's very popular tho, so don't be alarmed if there's a long line when you get here.. the workers are super efficient and very sweet, so the line moves fast! If you're looking for boba and are in the Tempe area, I'd definitely recommend DaYungs :) (Plus don't forget to grab a loyalty card too!)"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. We're happy every time visiting here. The drink is very good. The customer service is outstanding. The store is very clean."}
{"text":"This place is pretty far from where I live, but I'm glad I made the trip (sort of).

This place has only been opened for a little over the month. It's super clean, lots of seating, bright lighting, and the staff is wonderful. I had a couple of questions about the items on the menu, and the girl who took my order was super friendly and answered each and every question.

Their drink menu is pretty small compared to other boba places, but there's still plenty of options to choose from! You can customize how much ice you want and how sweet you want your drink. You can also sample your drink before you buy it!

I had the green milk tea with boba, 30% sweetness and it was great! The boba could've had more flavor, but it's texture was nearly perfect!

I'd give this place five stars, but unfortunately, my (horrible) date ordered a strawberry smoothie and it wasn't blended all too well. Chunks kept getting stuck in his straw. But let's be honest, he probably deserved it..

I'll be sure to check out the strawberry smoothie next time and ask for it to be extra blended! I'm excited that DaYung exists!"}
{"text":"I'm taking off another one start because they charge $0.50 for credit card payment. One other star was for the stomach ache I got after getting a latte although I'm not lactose intolerant.

Price? Expensive because of the $0.50 in which they also charge tax for. I never bring cash with me so maybe that's my fault or is it? Although, they did inform me about charging $0.50 but there was nothing I can do as I already drove there and ordered. 

Taste? My latest order of GuanYin Latte tastes fine. I wouldn't say it is the best tea because it tastes like any other ones I tried in other places. There was no ice level as I recall. So basically, with 2/3 amount of ice you got, that large boba tea seems like a small/medium to me for $5.35. So, to whomever said the portion is big, I have to disagree. How about give me 0% ice level. And, I ordered just a regular tea, nothing close to a fancy specialty of fresh fruits adding with crema and includes 3 toppings. I only had basic boba. 

Service? The service is okay. The employees are friendly. I have nothing to complain about that."}
{"text":"I don't even live in AZ and I've been to this place three times in the last two weeks when my business trips take me here.  They are extremely heavy handed with the boba... nice problem to have and their drinks are pretty fresh tasting.  Really love this place."}
{"text":"I was greeted as soon as I came in. The staff is super friendly and helpful. I asked for suggestions and got a few based on what I like. I ended up getting two drinks one now and one for later. Currently drinking the jade lemon with added boba. It's so delicious, I can't wait to move here to come back! When I left I was thanked again. This is a perfect place for some boba and so much more."}
{"text":"Everything about my first experience was 5 stars!  From the moment you walk in you cannot escape the exploding enthusiasm of the lady upfront.  I have to think she either owns the place or is THAT passionate about tea.  I saw her high five another customer who happened to order a drink that was also her favorite.  She was so happy and cheerful while describing and recommending all their drinks.  She offered us multiple samples that really helped us choose what we liked.  The GuanYin milk tea is like no other milk tea we've had as it's a very fragrant oolong tea base.  They also have Taiwanese Ai Yu jelly which I haven't had since Taiwan!  After long contemplation over the amazing fresh options, my two friends and I all settled on the Pink Beauty.  Boy it lived up to the lady's promises - fresh pulpy grapefruit juice, refreshing splash of lime, aloe Vera pulp, and lemony ai yu jelly.  We fought our toddlers for the drinks it was so good.  We did feel the baseline sweetness was a tad much for us but they do offer less or more sugar levels. Next time will go one step lower in sugar scale.  Will definitely come back and try other flavors!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Really refreshing drinks as well as an awesome/creative menu. I wish they were open later because I'd definitely be a more regular customer. They're boba is the perfect consistency too (very important to me) haha."}
{"text":"Love coming here after I hit the gym to get a nice cold great tasting tea. My personal fav is the green tea milk tea, if you don't like it milky then get it with a strong tea to cover the milkyness. Great tea, great service, and cool place to sit and sip.."}
{"text":"Cool new boba place! Friendly staff, clean and hip looks inside. Got the Boba Milk Tea and it's perfect. It's not overpoweringly sweet, just right. They seem to use both tiny boba balls, and a few bigger ones, which is surprisingly nice. Will be back with friends!"}
{"text":"I can't praise this place enough! 

Drinks are amazing, best I have ever tried in AZ! Actually even better than a lot of popular places in CA. The fruit tea are comparable to roasting water and tastea of gargen grove. They are currently out of wintermelon tea but I really have high hope that it's just as good as Kungfu tea of Vegas. However, this place flavor profile is a bit different and unique! You can still taste the tea flavor as aftertaste so it s not overpowering as all! :) 

Milk tea are really good! My bf and I really like their guayan tea and their bobas are amazing!!!

One only thing I don't like is how ice the drinks are. I just don't like sucking up ice and numb my mouth :( however, for some drink they say they can't do it without so I just left it there for the ice to dissolve."}
{"text":"Update 6/30/18: I used to think this place wasn't good but I actually ended up liking it. It's cheaper than the other boba places and still have good quality. It's also a really good study or hang out place. They still put a lot of boba in the drinks but that's something you can ask less for. My favorite is the Boba Milk Tea and the Fresh Strawberry. I just like how fresh the fruit taste. And the customer service is really nice. They physically give you the drink themselves instead of you getting up and getting it. And they always say thank you and enjoy. There's this lady that has an high pitch voice with an accent. She is so cute and I appreciate her always giving me my drink!"}
{"text":"Visited with a few friends on a whim and instantly loved it. Clean atmosphere, fresh scents, and very comfortable vibes all around. Customer service was wonderful and the cashier was more than happy to offer recommendations (and give samples)! Tomato smoothie is on their menu and honestly threw me in for a doozy, but once I sampled it, it shut me up since it was incredibly refreshing.

Usually not a fan of getting boba with my drink these days, but this place, once I've tasted their boba, I made an exception for the first time in a long time. Their boba was soft, chewy, and the best I've had for as long as I could remember. 

I bought the strawberry fresh milk and I finished my drink in less than 10 minutes. Refreshing, clean, and sweet flavors; I would definitely get it again. It felt like my insides were being cleaned (in a very good way??), haha. Even bought a boba milk tea to go because I live all the way in Glendale! 

Overall, incredibly positive experience. Bring cash if you can since they don't take orders less than $5 with a credit card. But honestly, I wouldn't mind getting two drinks and double-fisting their refreshing drinks anyways, hah."}
{"text":"I love their strawberry fresh milk! They should make it bigger size. 
Some of my friend said the boba is too small but i was okay with it. 
One thing is they don't have a mango smoothie even tho they are using its picture as their advertisement. However, lovely place."}
{"text":"After being let down by almost everything I tried here in Arizona, I was super excited to try this place bc it's really hard to mess up on boba. I had high expectations because of all the reviews I read and this place did not disappoint! 

We couldn't decide what to order so we just ordered everything we wanted LOL. The GuanYin latte & jasmine green milk teas were just okay, but I really liked the orange green tea with aloe Vera (if you want something refreshing) and the fresh strawberry milk (almost like a fresh strawberry smoothie, but on the sweeter side)! 

All employees were super friendly, their service is super fast & the prices are fair!"}
{"text":"Guan Yin Latte is freaking yummy. I love the ice texture in it (which is weird). 

They have a new special every week and the employees are always super considerate and kind. Always very clean.

As you can see from other picture, there is tons of Boba in each one (which is my favorite part). You can also change the sweetness level but I stay around 50-70. 

The fruity ones are very fruity but my fiancé likes them and I think they are pretty good, I'm just not a fruit person."}
{"text":"Last week I was here to try their boba milk tea, they were out of black tea and was waiting for shipment from Taiwan. Today before I headed over here, I called ahead to ask if they have black tea , the answer was yes. I drove over and ordered boba milk tea, and was told they are out of boba. What? How hard is it to get a boba milk tea? How do you constantly just run out of ingredients that are essential for your business? The two stars off are for the two occasions described above. Otherwise, the girl at the counter has been nice and tea tastes pretty good!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for BOBA!!!!

I like the atmosphere and the menu. Yummy tea!! 
There is a young lady at the register who is super friendly and kind. She gives you an idea of what you would like. They always have samples to try and you get a huge selection. I wish they had more locations. I drive 20 min to go here but so worth it! 


Keep up the great job!!"}
{"text":"Best boba tea In the valley.  
The selection is great from tea latte, fruit smoothies, and other blend of flavor drinks. 
The portions are generous and typically really friendly staff. 
I have been here about twenty times since they opened a year ago even though i lived about 15 miles away. :P
If you like boba teas, this is must go!!!"}
{"text":"I've been searching all over Phoenix for my go to bubble tea spot while I'm in the city for a few weeks. I've found it at dayung! The seasonal flavors are refreshing albeit sweet. I would opt for less sugar. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"One of the best most freshest tastes in the valley. I ate at others that had more variety but doesn't use as much fresh fruit. Very fresh."}
{"text":"Yup, it was great.  Friendly.  Good drinks.  Nice and cool on a hot day. 
 

Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite boba place!! The drinks are great and the boba is yummy! Love that they give samples cuz it helps me try new things and find new favorite drinks!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Fast.  Great prices. Very clean.  Very friendly and service.  Damn tasty Boba Tea.   I'd highly recommend.  Menu has some awesome drink choices."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this tea place after searching for boba tea in Phoenix. We looked up reviews and decided to give DaYung's a try. 
Atmosphere was friendly and open - seems like a place college students would frequent. 

We opted for the pink lady and the kiwi smoothie. Both were delicious on a hot day. Pink lady had aloe, grapefruit and I believe some pieces of kiwi? It was delicious nonetheless and the tapioca was just the right consistency. 

I liked that there were many options, not just milk teas, but smoothies and combination drinks as well. Prices were very reasonable and sizes were large!"}
{"text":"I would give more stars if that was possible. We came here after our friend recommended it, and it did not disappoint! As soon as we entered we were greeted. As it was our first time, we took our time reading the menu at the counter, and while we decided our orders, the super-friendly cashier offered us multiple tastings. She also offered to make changes to our orders if we didn't like them. We ordered a large boba milk tea and a strawberry fresh milk with boba. I love that you can order different levels of sweetness and ice, and both drinks were fresh and delicious!  The decor is simple, clean, and bright, as are the restrooms. We were greeted on the way out too. Now I wish we had tipped them more! Even though it's a bit of a drive for us, this is definitely our new go-to place for bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Wow, I was going to Papa Murphy's next door and saw this place had just opened. I walked in and it was packed. I ordered the grapefruit green tea with boba. What makes this place stand out is they don't use any of those syrups that have a fake fruit flavor...they use real fruit! It took a while to get my drink because it was still the grand opening and they were offering a buy one get one free deal.  But it was well worth the wait. It has definitely become my favorite boba place (and there are a lot popping up in Tempe lately!)"}
{"text":"Exceptional fresh tea, not your powder mix type but actually fresh tea. Staff is friendly and is very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. 

The Jade lemon is very refreshing and I would highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Friendly people. 5$ minimum on debit/credit card.
Their only menu was located at the very front of the cash register, simple, small and laminated. 
The drink sizes are limited majority being Large. 
The woman working the register was kind and courteous.   She welcomed us as we walked in, gave us samples while we looked at the menu and offered recommendations. 

My friend ordered a L Kiwi Smoothie, the menu however didn't describe there being apples in it until she mentioned it so be aware of that.

I ordered a L Jade Lemonade w Boba and Aiyu(Jelly). This was one of the samples she offered and I liked it. 
Because of the 5$ minimum card charge I had to get 2 extras added in. 
No complaints, especially since when asked what a good recommendation would be for this particular drink it turned out great. Didn't even realize it was a Taiwanese place until we had a discussion on Aiyu so pretty ignorant on my end but learned something new!"}
{"text":"Favorite place so far for milk tea or black tea latte! It's different from other places cause you can actually taste that it was made from scratch meaning the milk tea wasn't made from powder mixed with water by actual brewed tea with cream! Also the amount of ice in it is just perfect so it doesn't get watery at the end! Defiantly would recommend to any milk tea lovers!"}
{"text":"Best boba tea joint in Arizona hands down. They use really fresh ingredients and promote health and wholesomeness. My favorite is the Black Tea Macchiato. It's mainly black tea with a macchiato foam on top, I like to slit the lid, take a sip of the foam then drink some black tea at the bottom with the straw. A better duo than fried chicken and ketchup. Besides that, I love the guan yin latte with herbal jelly, jade lemon, and hot longan tea with red dates."}
{"text":"I haven't had any drinks like this place before. I am a big sucker for orange . That is why when I had the \"orange beauty\" it heavenly delicious. Also, if you like grapefruit the \"pink beauty\" is the same as the orange version. It has aloe Vera bits in the drink. The drinks here are made fresh to order and measured so the consistency is always exact. 

The service here is fast and friendly. I always order a minimum of 10 drinks every time."}
{"text":"Coming from LA, where our milk tea game is very strong, this place is pretty decent.  The tea itself is pretty good and the boba lacked a sweetness to it.  This place has great service and they have weekly deals on their boba, so we got their special and enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"The four times I've been to DaYung they've been out of boba twice! As much as I love the boba, I wish they would have boba at all times of the day. They have a wide variety of different drinks for you to try and their smoothies are delicious too! I love getting Wintermelon anything since it's a great flavor and I'm never disappointed!! They also offer a punch card so you can get a free drink on your 10th or so visit!! Overall I'm pleased with this place and would come back again :)"}
{"text":"Best boba in Arizona period.  100% authentic!  Save your plane ticket money to Taiwan."}
{"text":"I am already a fan of this place! I love how they use fresh ingredients and their customer service is right on! I came today to try it out and I am so glad I did! Even though they ran out of their green tea macchiato, I didn't mind because their staff was so friendly and honest about giving me back change for the difference. 
I tried their strawberry milk, which was so fresh! I also noticed that they have fresh ingredients because you can see the fruits in the fridge and tomato for their tomato milk, which would be very interesting. Let me know how that one taste!"}
{"text":"Big Easy parking lot. 

I tried the original Boba milk tea. Price was around $4 or $4.05 with tax.
I had 30% sugar and 50% ice. Sweetness was just right at that. The boba pearls were okay, not hard, definitely chewy. Milk tea itself was okay as well compared to other places.

Environment is pretty good. Lots of tables. Only Two outlets in the place. Wi-Fi is pretty reliable, but it will cut out after an hour or so. I had trouble reconnecting on to the wifi after that.

Friendly service.

Clean restroom. Will need a jacket if you're sitting inside, as it gets cold.

Would come back again."}
{"text":"Only been here twice, but both times have been A+! I'm excited that more boba places are opening up around here seeing that I've been spoiled in California. 

I've only had their boba milk tea, but that's usually how I rate a new boba place I'm trying. The flavor of the tea, the sweetness, and the tapioca balls were all on point. Plus they give you a huge serving for a decent price ($3.75). 

Another reason why I'm a fan...they are so nice here! They always ask if I want samples and are friendly every time. Sometimes a rarity! 

PS: They do take credit card, but will charge a fee if it's under a certain amount."}
{"text":"This is honestly the best place. Cheap prices and fresh fruit. Go to nektar and pay 8+ dollars for half the size."}
{"text":"the wintermelon lemon is great, refreshing and delicious. Would definitely go back and try different drinks."}
{"text":"This place is excellent in his drink and service and tested almost all drinks and really I don't have any that I can only say that I recommend it 100 either my favorite is pink beauty"}
{"text":"The best Taiwanese boba in the valley, hands down for me and my wife! Not your typical boba shop, DaYung's offer lots of refreshing drinks on their menu! Pink beauty is my go to drink, and with summer coming? I highly recommend trying out their drinks, they will not disappoint. Make sure to buy more than one, you'll always come back wanting more haha."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge boba tea drinker but wow. I got the fruit tea and it was life-changing. The prices seemed a bit high at first but you are definitely getting your money's worth. The drinks are large and have fresh fruit in them and if you get boba, they add in a lot. My friend got the pink beauty and the gel took some getting used to but it was great too. Service was also friendly and fast despite a lot of customers. Very happy and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here because he's never really had an authentic Asian tea/boba tea drink before. Looking at the menu he had never tried aloe, aiyu, or grass jelly before. The girl at the front was more than happy to get him samples of each so he could try them. I love that this place uses real fruit in their drinks. No one likes simple syrup and fake flavoring so this is a huge bonus. I also love that they have more options than just boba to add to your drink. My favorite place in Orange County, CA has a ton more options to add to your tea but this place has a good start. I ended up getting the strawberry milk tea with grass jelly. I absolutely love the fresh strawberry in the drink. It was really refreshing. I didn't find that my drink had too much milk in it so it still had a really forward strawberry flavor with a hint of creaminess. I added the grass jelly but it was over powered by the strawberry flavor. I love grass jelly though. I will probably order it with boba the next time I order the strawberry milk. My boyfriend got the strawberry kiwi smoothie with chia seeds and boba. I honestly liked his better than mine and will probably order that next time. The drink started with a strawberry flavor then ended with the kiwi note. The chia seeds added a nice little something extra to the drink. The boba here is cooked really well. It was soft and slighty gummy. My favorite part of all of this is that the drinks are really cheaply priced. Just can't beat that."}
{"text":"First time visit at this location and I had several people refer this place ! The selection of teas from no sugar to a small percentage is convenient. I had a tasty boba milk tea at 30% sugar content which was no sweet at all and perfect for my non sweet tea taste buds ! Friendly service!"}
{"text":"I heard this place is one of the best milk tea places in AZ so I had to give it a try! They gave me a fresh strawberry smoothie to try and it was good but I got the regular milk tea. It was..alright. I'll give it another try next time but I probably won't get the regular milk tea though. But hey, you get a large for about $4 which is pretty cheap!"}
{"text":"Best & authentic Boba milk tea in Phoenix. Fresh juice. Super friendly staffs. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I tried a couple of their drinks before, love all of them. Especially the taro green tea boba, really have small chunks of taro inside, really love it. And I love their friendly service as well."}
{"text":"First fresh fruit drinks store I found in AZ. 
We had 4 different drinks, all tasted better then I expected."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place...finally there is an authentic boba tea place in Arizona that's within driving distance. The employees are super nice here and very clean. I've tried their regular milk tea boba, jade lemon, strawberry kiwi smoothie, guanyin latte, strawberry fresh milk etc. All are very tasty and fresh tasting. I think the thing that keeps me coming back is the boba milk tea which has just the right amount of sweetness and the boba is cooked perfectly.

Overall, if you're looking for THE best milk tea boba you've ever had (rivaling that of California based places) go to DaYung's, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Easily best boba drink place in AZ. I live on the west side and will drive 30 mins to get some."}
{"text":"Great boba tea! 

I ordered the wintermelon tea, with boba and aiyu. Boba was perfectly cooked, and chewy!

Strawberry milk tea was really tasty. The lady at the counter offered us a sample of it, along with any item we were not sure about on the menu. 

Great customer service. Quick turnaround, and nice place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Strawberry fresh milk with aloe Vera!!!!!!!! Yes!!! The  iced jade lemon tea is nice too. I only wish that they had smaller sizes. All their drinks come in a venti size... which can be a bit too filling for me. The staff is also great. Always greeting you with big smiles and personally bringing your drink to you instead of just yelling your name or your receipt number."}
{"text":"Best boba drinks by far!  I am from Tucson and I have to stop here on the way up and on the way back home every time I am in town.  The drinks are made with fresh fruit juice...not powder mixes and you can definitely taste the difference.  Boba is always spot on...great texture and taste.  I love the orange beauty.  Hope the open a location in Tucson location in the near future"}
{"text":"I'm saving my boba allowance for here from now on! 
First time here, and got the boba milk tea since it was on promotion. Got it half sweetened, and it was just right! Refreshing drink, tasted more tea and freshness than other drinks that are just full of sugar. Boba was on point as well. Just the right chewiness, every one of them. 

Tried a couple samples, strawberry milk and another tea, and both were really good! Everything on the menu sounds super good, and I want to try them all!

Service was excellent! Beyond what I would except at any boba place, and probably the best I've ever received from a boba place. The girl up front was very patient and helpful, and even thanked me when I left. 

Very bright and clean place! It's far from me, so when I make a trek out to that side of the town, I will definitely come here!"}
{"text":"wow, yummy.  very very good. had the tomato smoothie, excellent! strawberry very good as well. boba quality is good, not too sweet and good chewy consistency."}
{"text":"The strawberry milk is delicious! So fresh! The staff is always really friendly and helpful! Perfect for the start of summer!"}
{"text":"Great quality of milk tea- you can taste that it's brewed with real tea. The portion is pretty good. Customization is a plus (you can choose the ice and sugar level). The service is top-notch and the manager/owner is very cheerful and nice. I consider this place to be better than Tea Swirl by a small margin (the price is a little bit higher over there)."}
{"text":"Had the fresh strawberry milk which was for refreshing and tasty. You can alter the sweetness and ice level as well. Decor here is chic and very modern looking and very inviting and well lit when you just walk in. Hey generally provide a small sample of whatever drink they're promoting which is nice since it helps you get familiar with a drink you might not otherwise order. 

Be sure to come with a friend if you plan on using a credit card as there's a fee for orders under $5. Boba balls are perfectly made here wish a good level of sweetness and chewiness. One of the better boba shops in the Phoenix area from what I can see as boba tea house by Lee Lee's was always my go to but a little far from campus. I would definitely recommend this place if you want a tasty and refreshing drink."}
{"text":"Okay y'all. Here's the lay down. I'm a SoCal born and raised, grew up on arguably the best boba outside of Asia. After coming to AZ, boba was one of the things I missed the most. So I have basically been trying all he new boba shops that been popping up around here. 

So here's the lay down. It's probably best boba in town. Well not that this achievement is saying much since boba in PHX is \"eeehhh\" but legit, this is pretty darn good for your typical boba shop. This would survive in CA, now that's saying something. 

They are know for the fruit drinks. They are pretty darn solid. The strawberry fresh milk, the kiwi, the grapefruit are all solid. 

I'm a milk tea fan myself and their guan Ying latte is their version of Oolong milk tea. Pretty good. Their milk tea is great as well. Green milk tea = yup. 

Most of the drinks are pretty sweet, but you can change the sweetness and level of ice. 


TLDR; probably best boba in PHX. Special fruits drinks, but everything is solid."}
{"text":"DaYung's Tea is new to the Tempe area and exists in a strip mall next to a large grocery store. There is ample free parking. I've been to DaYung's multiple times now and have had excellent service each time. Staff offer samples of their teas to taste and are patient in answering questions about their products. There is a good amount of seating area and tables. It seems like the place gets busy certain evenings but the wait times are to be expected for custom tea drinks."}
{"text":"This place is my top recommendation for milk tea near ASU. The tastes are good and the pricing is comparatively not too expensive."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place in town to get boba.  Since moving to Salt Lake City, I've been dreaming about the next time I'll have DaYung's Tea.  

My go to drink is the Guan Yin Latte.  It's creamy and the perfect amount of sweetness for me (though they let you adjust your sweetness level to your liking).  The boba is always consistent in terms of texture and taste.

Their fruit-based drinks are extremely refreshing and made of fresh fruit, which makes a huge difference in taste compared to other places that use powder.  My personal favorite fruit-based drink on a hot summer's day is the Jade Lemon Tea.  

I highly recommend anything on their menu as everything is made with fresh, quality ingredients.  As a bonus, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"The tea is good, the size is big too! Worth the money.
Update:
I come here so frequently that I almost try everything on the menu. They have really good strawberry fresh milk (obviously strawberry smoothie, but it is fresh) and banana milk tea is creative. I always order the boba milk tea which is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Orange green tea is theeeee best!  Haven't tried anything else on the menu.  I think the service could be faster.  The cashier takes forever to take orders esp when there's a line behind waiting."}
{"text":"Gotta update to 5 stars as this has become one of my favorite boba places. They always have a sample to try when I go in which is really nice because I don't know what many of the drinks taste like. Last time I visited, the sample was a wintermelon latte and it was so good, I ordered it today and was not disappointed. 

No matter how busy they are, they make their drinks in a timely manner and hand it to you, which is such a small, but meaningful gesture. Everyone is nice and their bathrooms are clean. Prices are great for the size they give you, and I like that we can adjust the sugar and ice level, though sometimes even less ice is too much for me. I just redeemed my free drink from a completed punch card, so I look forward to starting another one."}
{"text":"Bright, lively store with a smaller selection than other boba shops I've been in but that shouldn't deter you. Boba milk tea was fresh and delicious. They were even using martini type shakers to mix teas. Also the service was quick, helpful, and cheery. I appreciate that!"}
{"text":"There have been a bunch of new boba places popping up, but DaYung's is my new favorite!  They're located in shopping center on Mill and Southern in the same shipping center as the Fry's. They have a lot of different, unique drinks ranging from teas, to smoothies, to milk teas, and everything we've tried so far has been fresh and fantastic! My favorites so far are the Green Milk Tea and the GuanYin Latte. I'm also looking forward to getting their Strawberry Fresh Milk in the future, because the sample of that was super refreshing!

Their prices are fair for the size drink that you get, and they give you a great amount of boba if you choose to add that on.

Their staff is attentive, friendly, and doesn't hesitate to greet you as soon as you walk in the door. They also offer a sample or two of different drinks they have on the menu, which is great if you're looking to try something new without committing to it. 10/10 would definitely recommend! I'm always looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Black milk tea and boba milk tea are different menu items. Normally, the regular milk tea is black tea. The boba milk tea here is definitely different than the standard milk tea I've had elsewhere, and I like it. It has good tea flavor plus something else. I don't know if it's the tea or the sweetener (I've been to places that use black sugar or honey instead of white sugar), and it's not quite herbal like jasmine either. The boba was nice and chewy. $3.75 gets you a pretty big cup with pearls included, which I think is one of the best prices I've ever seen across the country!"}
{"text":"Once I walked in, I was greeted promptly by the girl behind the cashier. She was super friendly and gave us samples of the strawberry smoothie (super refreshing) and the Guan yin latte (made with oolong tea). When she gave me the drink, she stated that if the drink is too sweet, they can change it for me. I took a sip of it and it did end up being too sweet for me. I felt so bad asking her to re-make mine 50% sweet, but she was so nice and friendly about it. :) 
After the drink was re-made it was sooooooo good! I think this might be my new go to spot!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Right off the bat, you are greeted by their nice staff who are very helpful in not only recommending drinks but also sweetness level! Sweetness can break it or make it in these drinks, so it's great when staff are very knowledgeable how normal sweetness can vary from different types of drinks.

Most importantly the drinks here are absolutely refreshing. My favorite is the pink beauty. Please do yourself a favor and try this place out! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is relatively new in the area and they do a great job selling themselves. The menu is not very vast but what they have is quite delicious. The prices compare with all the other similar tea houses but they only have 1 size (large). Their selection of teas and juices are quite fresh and made to order. My grapefruit tea still had some pulp in it. They have a good guan ying milk tea as well as fresh orange tea. Sugar levels can be adjusted as well as ice. The service was lovely and they offered samples before ordering to get a feel for the flavors. You come here for the drink but the atmosphere is nice too. The workers are friendly and bring the drink to you. The music is the usual pop and the tables are a clean white. The booth seats are far more comfortable than the chairs but the chairs are still tolerable. I highly recommend checking them out they have a great motto and their drinks are delicious."}
{"text":"The drinks are so good and the service is awesome! Place is clean, and they're super fast. The girl who worked as a cashier today was super friendly."}
{"text":"I LOVE DaYung's! The strawberry fresh milk is so yummy and so are the milk teas! I love the customizable sweetness and ice level. I also really like how they use fresh fruits!
They are comparable to Tea Swirl or Boba Tree Lin House, but I honestly think they're my favorite of the 3!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! The staff is super friendly, there is plenty of seating, the interior is cute, and the drinks are delicious! 

The girl at the front was really helpful and we couldn't be happier with our decisions on what to order! We ordered the GuanYin Latte and Pink Beauty. They were both really refreshing. Overall this place is great and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the lady is too loud! And the way she talk is to weird. Please don't do that again! BS"}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  The tea is awesome and not a sugary as most Boba shops. I will be returning often"}
{"text":"Best boba place in AZ. Great taste and great price. The wait time is short and the service is great. Amazing amazing amazing. I don't think I will ever go to another boba place.

*Jade Lemon with boba with chia seed is amazing"}
{"text":"Love this place! 

The service is super friendly, the place is very well-lit, and the drinks are delicious. I like that they put emphasis on fruit teas rather than milk teas. The tapioca is pretty consistently good, too. Havent had a drink that I didn't like yet! Unless it's a drink made with fruit I didn't like to begin with. Then it's not really their fault... anyway I can see them getting pretty busy on weekends, and sometimes they are a little understaffed.

My only qualm is that they need WiFi. But most of the time, I just get my drinks to go. I would like the option of studying here or hanging out with friends with board games here though. There's just not that much seating for people to park themselves, I guess. 

DaYung, will you be getting WiFi anytime in the future?"}
{"text":"First visit today, and I'm happy with my choices!  Couldn't decide what to settle with, so I ordered THREE beverages: Pink Beauty, with aiyu; Boba Milk Tea; and Jade Lemon with aiyu. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=MuW9GCCWah3IojBYi5wgCg&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  All, except the milk teas, are made from scratch, as in not from a powdered mix, and all at requested 50% sweetness.  (Menu shows which drinks have \"sugariness fixed.\") https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=CkGuIMZC4taihqPHKqztXA&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  Important to note that all of the \"milk teas\" are made with powdered cream, while the lattes are made with whole milk!  (Had I known that, I'd have gone with GuanYin Latte (oolong tea), or Green Tea Latte.  Next time!

Pink Beauty: grapefruit, grapefruit juice, aloe vera, and ice. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=TvA5kMuXxDqtHLfmkXHeiA&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  Added aiyu, which is lemon grass jelly, made from scratch and WITHOUT gelatin-- I really recommend this-- for an additional $0.50.  The grass jelly served here is thick, and I absolutely adore the aloe vera pieces!  I initially missed the huge rings of grapefruit that Boba Tree includes in their version, but the amazing aiyu and aloe in DaYung's grapefruit beverage make this drink shine above!

Boba Milk Tea: black tea, fresh boba, ice, and powdered cream. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mJAziLpSbpCNsYBPyl0rdQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  It's good, but if I were to order this again, and I probably won't due to the powdered cream's inclusion, I would ask for 30% sweetness.  I'm not crazy about boba pearls in general, and there's a lot in this drink (which is great if you're a boba fan!), but I must say that these are the best boba I've had here in the States!  They're soft, yet with a great chew, and the boba is made fresh every four hours!  When one batch is made, the old batch is thrown away.

Jade Lemon: green tea, lemon juice, and ice. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mBSNDMRDsVPFdl27SbsMpg&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  Added aiyu for an additional $0.50.  Another winner!  Love the bouquet of the green tea- so floral and hits me at first sip!  The aiyu helps to cut the sweetness of the lemon juice.  If you look at the photo, you'll see a band floating around the middle of the cup-- that's the aiyu!  Very plentiful here, so if you're a fan, you'll enjoy this drink with added aiyu.

Fiona and Gina were both delightful and very helpful in providing info-- some I asked for, and some eagerly volunteered.  

Very impressed today, and I hope the beverage quality and service stay consistent.  I hope to be able to give five stars on my next visit!

Side notes:  Fiona told me that aiyu is lemon grass jelly, but I suppose she could've also meant \"lemongrass\" jelly.  According to Wikipedia, aiyu jelly is made from the gel of seeds from Ficus pumila var. awkeotsang, a variety of fig found in Taiwan and other East Asian countries.  Whatever it is, the jelly made here is delightful!  Also, Gina told me that the aloe vera DaYung uses is from Thailand, of very high quality.  I was very impressed with the delightful cubes-- so much fun to eat!"}
{"text":"I'm freaking out about how good this place is. I LOVE boba drinks, and it's hard to find a nice place with fresh ingredients, good prices, and friendly service. This place has all that! I got the strawberry kiwi smoothie with double boba, price was under $4, and they handed it to me less than 5 minutes after ordering. The smoothie is SO good!! I can tell it was made with real, fresh kiwi which makes a big difference. Highly recommend, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"my friend and I went and ordered: grapefruit green tea Boba and orange green tea with boba. Both drinks use fresh squeezed fruit juice that makes it very refreshing. Baba was chewy as they should. FYI, there is a limit to use it card -$5 minimum. and one drink will be less than $5. so plant well! I will go back to have some more!"}
{"text":"This boba place has the best drinks in AZ!
The host and the workers there are super friendly!! Come and try!! P.S so far I really like fresh milk strawberry with boba and guan yin latte with boba!!"}
{"text":"My definition of Double Bubble not only includes chewing gum, but also means double bubble tea! I'm excited about having another bubble tea shop in Tempe. They are running a BOGO offer for their large size boba milk teas for their opening weekend so it was too good of a deal to pass up. 

I like how the menu specifies that you can choose the sweetness level and the amount of ice in your drink. For mine I had 50% sweet with no ice. The price normally is very reasonable, $3.75 pre-tax for a large boba milk tea. 

It was moderately busy and it took maybe 10-15 minutes for them to make my bubble tea order. The very cheery and friendly cashier brought the order right to my table. 

The milk tea was loaded with a lot of mixed small and regular size tapioca pearls. They were soft and chewy. At 50% sugar it was very lightly sweet. I'd say compared to similar bubble tea shops where I've requested the same sugar level, it's less sweet than the others, maybe at like 20-30% which isn't a bad thing at all since I'd rather have my milk tea less sweet than too sweet. I could taste the tea but most of the flavor came from the creaminess of the drink. The drinks were sealed using the special heat-sealing plastic bubble tea machine which made it easy for transport.

Note that there is a minimum $5 purchase if you don't want to be charged an extra $.50 for using credit card.

Overall it was pretty good! I'm intrigued by some of the other drinks on the menu so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My fav boba in Az! The lady at the front was so nice and patient, and the drinks and boba were way better compared to other places I've been to!"}
{"text":"Great drinks! Love the jade lemon since It is so refreshing. Love the regular boba milk tea. Banana milk tea taste pretty good too. Had the taro milk before, it was okay only for my taste."}
{"text":"All the juice is so fresh and tasty  
Best drinks from Taiwan!!!!
Especially recommend the strawberry milk  
Best drink I've had in the states"}
{"text":"Refreshing. Fresh. Fantastic. I'm just wanting more!  I could totally down a pitcher of all the teas here! 
Grapefruit green tea and orange green tea are my favorite fruity teas. Jade lemon and pink beauty (grapefruit and aloe) come in next for my desired fruit crave. Kiwi green tea is also another one that's just as good! The fresh fruit tea comes with the seasonal fruits - mine came with slices of apples, oranges, lime, grapefruit, and a grape tomato. 

The menu may change depending on what fruits are available. 

These are all made with fresh fruit. So you get tiny bits and pieces of the fruit the blend. You'll get a bigger straw if your drink includes boba or aloe. 

The creamy drinks that I have tried so far is the classic boba milk tea, which is really good!

The strawberry fresh milk is made with whole milk.

The GuanYin latte is something special if you are into Oolong! 

You may request an adjustment with the sweetness and volume of ice. 

I can't wait to try the rest of the menu! I'll get 3 drinks for myself at one time. I know. Selfish. Sorry. Not really."}
{"text":"Fresh fruits at a cheap price? Sign me up please.  Must try if you're in the area

I love boba tea and love it when they're done right.  None of the powdery stuff seen in most places nowadays.   The owner gave us a sample of green tea mixed worth orange juice.  Something so simple!! The taste blew me away.  You can definitely taste the difference when quality ingredients are used.  The owner and staff were supper friendly and the inside was kept clean. Prices are more than reasonable.  Definitely going back a few times before i return to Albuquerque"}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Always offering a sample of one of their flavors of tea. My go to boba tea spot from now on."}
{"text":"Been here too many times to even mention since I first tried it earlier this year. This is my new favorite boba place in Arizona!! Love the fact that it's close by ASU. Staff is always super friendly and helpful. Their stamp cards are everything (I'm already halfway through my 2nd card). Everything is fresh and tasty! Here, you are able to adjust sugar and ice levels to your liking. My favorites are the green milk tea and pink beauty - both with boba."}

{"text":"Honestly the best boba in all of Arizona by far. Staff is very friendly and the place is super clean. The portions are huge for only a 3-4 dollars. They have weekly specials where a selection is discounted. Other places in town are 6 or 7 dollars for not as good. They make their grass jelly in house! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Probably the best boba ive had in Arizona since moving here 2 years ago from California by a large margin."}
{"text":"Came here after lunch around 1pm. It's in a plaza so plenty of parking. Stepped inside and noticed he spacious place and the cashier immediately offered us samples of their jasmine tea. They provide samples upon request -  I know this because I was curious what the aiyu topping was and she gave me a sample. For those who are curious, it's like a pudding texture but clear and sweet. 

My boyfriend and I each ordered a drink: one from the fruit menu and one from the macchiato section. I got the DaYung fruit tea and he got the black tea macchiato. I have to say, he black tea macchiato tasted a lot better than the fruit tea. The fruit tea tasted like it consisted of mostly orange juice and some lemon with a bunch of cut slices of apples, oranges and grapes floating on top. I didn't taste any other fruit but mostly orange so it was disappointing. I asked for 50% sweetness and less ice. They make their drinks with all fresh fruits, which I would think the fruit tea would be the best option. I recommend ordering from the macchiato menu vs fruit tea. Would like to return and give another drink another try next time I'm back around. Large cups for $4.50 each was a decent price too."}
{"text":"The place is really good and they have a variety of good drinks. I got the black tea macchiato, my friends got the taro green tea and the boba milk tea. I recommend to get less sugared drinks and then if you feel like adding more then ask for it."}
{"text":"I cant say enough about this place. Quick serivce, welcoming atmosphere, and Quali-tea drinks."}
{"text":"Boba milk tea is ! I saw the reviews and needed to try this place! 1st thing you'll notice about this place is that it's nice and clean compared to the actual vicinity of where it's located at! The menu is fairly simple yet they seem to put on emphasis on everything being very fresh!  

I tried the boba milk tea and it was great! The boba texture was perfect, which makes or breaks how I feel about a boba place! Good amount of sweetness, good amount of milkiness, overall it's a very refreshing drink. 

My wife had a \"pink beauty\" which is a slush drink that was recommend by the cashier. It was alright. I think the consistency between the ice and liquid was not right, so it turned out to be too icy.  Also it maybe needed a little bit more sweetness. We told the lady it was our first time here, and she didn't really explain the menu that great. I JUST learned afterwards, that you can ask for different percentages of sweetness. 

I'll have to update my review once I get more drinks from this place, but overall it's a great place for milk tea. I wouldn't recommend getting the slush drinks."}
{"text":"I have been taking about nothing but pink beauty since I was there like two weeks ago. It is rightfully advertised on their screens cuz it's actually good! My friend had a sip and decided she must also have that drink! Husband got a plain ai-yu drink but mostly drank mine anyway 

It's good, tastes fresh, reasonable pricing for America, if I lived in the area I'd def get it semi often! So refreshing and delicious, even in our warm winters! 

If you don't know, ai-Yu is a Taiwanese, jello-like food made with lime juice often. Pink beauty is made with some grapefruit juice or pieces/pulp and blended with ice. Because I have sensitive teeth, next time I'm gonna ask to get it not blended with ice...couldn't enjoy my drink because it was too cold"}
{"text":"Very clean looking place, new and all. Good prices for the quantity you get. The boba was good, chewy, soft and warm.
I was a little disappointed in the milk tea itself. Wish I could have tasted the tea more. It tasted pretty bland. 
I did however like that you can custom your ice and sweetness level."}
{"text":"I've recommended so many of my friends to come here it's probably the best boba/tea I've ever had. You can tell all their ingredients are very fresh and high quality! I'm trying to try everything on the menu because I haven't been disappointed yet! I love the pink beauty if I want something really refreshing or the black tea macchiato, the stuff on top is really really good."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't know there was a new boba place in my area. So once I found out about this place I knew I had to try it, 1. Cause I love boba and 2. Rave reviews on yelp. So did my sleuthing on here to see what was good and what the had to offer. So I came here right after work the day I found out about this place 10/17 with my order ready, 1 for me and 1 for the BF. Of course I had to order the boba milk tea, cause a boba place that can't make a a decent milk tea shouldn't even be a boba shop in my opinion. I also got the pink beauty for my boy friend. When I got the the place was nice and clean with a good handful of people there for a Wed night. The cashier gave me a sample of their kiwi smoothie while I looked over the menu. After sampling it, I got a wired tingling on my tongue...I'm guessing the kiwi was not ripe enough. I was also thrown by the menu, as I mentioned I used yelp to determine my drinks and in the menus posted the had a small size for most of the drinks. Their new menu mostly consisted of large sizes, which disappointed me, cause I can never finish large drinks and I think its wasteful. Other than that both drinks were very good, the only drawback is the size."}
{"text":"The grapefruit green tea is my absolute favorite. I go there almost everyday at least once, sometimes twice, just to get their grapefruit green tea. Every time you go they always have 1-2 samples for you to try, and all of their drinks are super refreshing. I'm not big on boba or milk tea, so I can't say much about those but my friends  really like them. Another one of my favorites is the strawberry fresh milk, it pretty sweet and tastes like a strawberry smoothy...but super yummy. I am always bringing people there to try their drinks and no one is ever unhappy. Definitely my favorite place in Tempe, and the employees are extremely sweet and welcoming."}
{"text":"I'm in love ! I have been looking for a drink stop that can accommodate morning noon and night . I love the kiwis green tea smoothie . Amongst other drinks I enjoy the black crystal tea. The jade lemon and strawberry drinks are some of the best! Banana smoothie free samples are phenomenal! Thanks Dayung for having a fabulous menus and great employees."}
{"text":"I am so happy there's so many new boba places popping up in AZ. Dayung stands out because their drinks taste so FRESH. They don't use syrups and use fruits in all their smoothies. 

The LARGE is also HUGE and and the price is less expensive then some of the other boba places around (looking at you Urban Boba). 

Recommended Drinks:
- Strawberry Fresh Milk 
- GuanYin Latte (Oolong Milk Tea essentially)
- Green Milk Tea 

They didn't have their Wintermelon in stock, but I'll definitely try that next time. 

The place is clean and had a nice big parking lot. They don't have a lot on their menu, but all the drinks I've tried have all been tasty. All the staff are so wonderful and attentive and theyu want to make sure to like your drink."}
{"text":"The staff here makes the experience worth while! Everything is fresh from the fruits to the teas. I haven't tried a drink that I didn't like yet. My favorites so far are the Guan Yin Latte and the Fresh Strawberry Milk, but whatever you get, you can't go wrong! If you like them on Facebook, they have weekly specials that's are great deals!"}
{"text":"Can we talk about DAYUNG'S FRUIT TEA. Instead of building up my review, I decided to cut straight to the point. I had the fruit tea and it was like a refreshing, fruity wonderland within every sip. Definitely a great addition to a hot day or perfect you feel like you haven't been eating too healthy. The drink comes with a straw and fork so you can actually eat the fruit inside (which includes oranges, apples, limes, and grape tomatoes). I have also tried the classic Boba Milk Tea as well as the Kiwi & Strawberry Smoothie, which were also nothing short of incredible.

Considering the customer service, quality, and overall experience, this place is worth a try. I have recommended this place to all my friends and if you've read this far into my review, I'd call you a friend too. So try it today!!"}
{"text":"Strawberry Fresh Milk Smoothie was amazing!  Boba Milk Tea just as good! Staff was friendly and wanted to make sure we were happy!  Man place with lots of potential! Check it out! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good milk tea and great service! The staff are very friendly and they are very accommodating!

My favorites are the milk tea (iced) and green milk tea (hot)...

It is small and seating fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Went there 6 days in a roll. The tea was fresh, fruity, and delicious. Best tea place in the valley!"}
{"text":"New boba shop on Mill and Southern in the Fry's plaza right next to Papa Murphy's. This is chain from Taiwan and the first in the US! They  are doing a bunch of different promos for Grand opening until  9/24. Make sure to get the stamp card for an extra $1 off.There were samples in the front for the fresh  strawberry milk and milk tea. The store was clean and inviting and they looked like they had a solid crew  making our boba. 

 Today we got the special for their Iced Guan Yin Latte's. Our two LG size bobas came out $5.00 which is a steal. They packed the fresh  bobas in. I like their style  of Boba which is a mixture  of large boba and small boba. 

Other  toppings on the menu include chia seeds, aloe vera, aiyu jelly, and grass jelly. For the more health conscious boba drinker  this is your spot! (They can customize sweetness & Ice). 

The guan yin milk tea was still light for me. I can't wait to try the other drinks like Assam Milk tea or Wintermelon tea. They are definitely well priced and worth a stop!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Green Tea Milk Tea, I usually just get regular tea without the milk. But they recommended to try the Milk Tea with stronger tea because I didn't want it to milky. 

In my opinion, it still had too much milk. I do like Thai tea and Milk Tea . 

The cashier was very polite and the owners! Everyone wS so cheerful. Positive vibes.

Next time, I'll try something else."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and haven't been disappointed yet. Always courteous service & all the drinks have been delicious- would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best boba place in town. You can customize sugar and ice levels which is pretty cool but the best part about this place is the service. Upon entering you'll be greeted by the most bubbly and ecentric lady. It's awesome. You also usually get a random sample Everytime. 

I've been a couple times already and I've pretty much stopped going to other boba places. None can compare. They got my order once wrong and replaced it as well as refunded my difference. It was very nice and unnecessary. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Not really amazing. They don't even offer really different kinds of traditional milk teas. The bobas were very hard, and the tea was very average. I would go somewhere else. The only reason I give two stars is because you get a fairly large amount for the price."}
{"text":"Great place to take the family... fresh n clean
Impressive environment and customer service experience."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I think the difference with this boba place compared to other boba places is that all their drinks are AMAZING! I would recommend to try all the drinks they offer.  I live on the West side but I would drive out here just to get drinks. 

All their drinks are fresh with natural ingredients. It doesn't taste powdered. They have reasonable prices and it is also a friedly environment. The moment you step in this place you're greeted instantly with a warm welcome. They often have small drink samples for you to try while you wait for your order."}
{"text":"Probably the best boba spot here in Arizona. Workers are very welcoming and friendly. The drinks are very refreshing and cheap as well! I recommend the orange beauty"}
{"text":"This place is definitely my favorite when I crave some boba or sweet drink in general :) also they have nice service here... always feel welcome"}
{"text":"Yummy bubble tea I usually just stick to the basic milk tea with boba. They are cheaper then he other boba places but with fewer boba tea options. 
But the items they do have is really good. 

Their boba is a little chewy and smaller
I like it!"}
{"text":"Went there around week night, around 8p or so.  Surprise to see about 4 or 5 workers, but only 2 other customers.  Not sure why they are over staffed?

Anyway, ordered one of the boba drinks where they could make a slushy out of.  It was a tea flavor...forgot the name.  I got it to go so that I can enjoy it when I go back to my hotel.  Have to say, it was very good.  The boba has a slight honey or sweet flavor, and it had the right amount of chewiness.  The tea was flavorful, unlike some places where they would water down the tea.  Overall, it's hard to go wrong with boba tea, as long the boba and tea are both freshly made, and not something that was left over from several days ago."}
{"text":"This place is as fresh as they claim. Best boba milk tea I've had in Tempe and in a long while! So far I have tried the Taro Green Milk Tea (twice), the GuanYin Latte (favorite), and the Strawberry Milk (a blended drink!). Always with boba that is perfectly cooked every time. I haven't tried adding the Aloe Vera yet but it sounds refreshing. The counter service is always insanely friendly (not over-the-top Dutch Bros status but just right) and the employees are very helpful. They bring your drink right to you which I find very original and kind! It's nice to sit and relax and not worry about getting your name called to the front. There is always at least one sample drink to try. Today they had Jade Lemon, crisp, bright flavor with a hint of tart. In the past it's been Banana Milk Tea (yummy!) and Strawberry Milk (delish). Love Love Love that DaYung's is close to home. I can't get enough!"}
{"text":"Straight from Taiwan and with over 300 restaurants open worldwide, there's no wonder DaYung's is rated as one of the best! 

Especially with an Arizona summer, the refreshing taste of DaYung's teas and smoothies will leave your taste buds wanting more! One of my friends ordered a Pink Beauty, and you can literally taste the freshness in the fruit that they use. It's awesome to see a boba tea shop use real and fresh fruit!

The milk tea with boba is a classic favorite, and I would also recommend the grapefruit green tea, for a refreshing taste of sweet and sour."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite tea store from Taiwan. Fresh fruit smoothies and the prices are friendly. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"As a huge boba enthusiast- Best boba in Arizona, hands down. The staff are especially friendly and the prices are cheaper than most places in town."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!!!!!! Drinks are high quality and much cheaper than other places."}
{"text":"I have been back a few times and continue to really enjoy this place!

here's my rating of the drinks I've tried:
-tomato smoothie 3/5: just too tomato-y for me for a whole drink
-strawberry kiwi smoothie 4/5: no dairy in this smoothie, which is a plus!
-pink beauty 4/5: you must like grapefruit to enjoy this
-lemon aiyu 5/5: it has chunks of jelly-like fruit in it, which are really interesting in taste and texture
-black crystal 4/5: I really like the grass jelly, however it's too sweet and this drink they cannot alter the sweetness level

also, the boba has been 5/5 every time I've visited! I appreciate that they give you a LOT of boba when you order it."}
{"text":"Hands down best authentic boba in Arizona, with very reasonable prices considering how large each drink is. The boba is a perfect consistency, and the staff are extremely nice and helpful as well."}
{"text":"DaYung, here's to the start of a brew-tea-ful friendship! *clinks boba glasses*

First of all, service here is pretty great. The lady at the register was friendly and talkative.  She even gave us a sample of the Strawberry Fresh Milk and it was amazing! If it wasn't so heavy on milk, I would probably get this. Instead, we took advantage of their grand opening special of BOGO boba milk tea. After tax, I paid $4.05 for two drinks. Gotta love drink specials! 

The milk tea itself was pretty good. It's not quite as heavy and rich like the Hong Kong style milk tea where they use condense milk but is instead much lighter. I love the small boba they use here.  Did I accidentally swallow a couple when I was chugging down my drink?  You betcha! But what doesn't kill you makes you stronger... or something. 

I recommend the tomato smoothie with aloe vera. It's not savory like a Bloody Mary but it tastes more like sweet cherry tomatoes. The aloe vera has no flavor so it's more like chewing on tomato meat."}
{"text":"Best boba in Phoenix. The milk tea is so good. I like how I can adjust the sweetness by choose normal amount of sweetness, 50%, or 30%. I get the 30% and it is perfect. Boba drinks are usually way to sweet and make you feel full but these drinks are always the perfect amount and balance. I really need to try the other drinks but the milk tea gets me every time. The only \"criticism\" is they can be a little slow but if they are drinks are fresh and good, I'd wait any day.

The staff is super friendly and now they have a loyalty card. They always have a sample for me to try which is so smart because it entices me to try everything on their menu. I'm halfway to my free boba, lol!

When it's fresh and made well, you don't have to worry about much else."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from California and decided to check out some milk tea places around in Phoenix. I saw this on yelp and decided to give it a shot to see how comparable it is to California (the capital of milk tea/boba) in the U.S. I lived near Los Angeles and currently live in the Bay Area. I have to admit, this place is pretty good! I ordered the jade lemon with chia seeds and it definitely satisfied my thirst! The staff members were very friendly as well! Well done Arizona!"}
{"text":"Very delicious! The service is very friendly and I love the deals they offer sometimes. Its also great that they offer customizability to customers to have different sugar preferences. I do reccomend using cash for your purchase if you're buying one single drink because they charge a fee is you don't exceed the minimum which I believe is $5 so please keep that in mind.  I have nothing more to say than this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is the boba place to go to in Tempe, without a doubt. They use real tea and real fruit. They cook their boba perfectly and you can adjust your sweetness and ice levels. Only bad thing is that they only have one size for certain drinks."}
{"text":"DaYung's is one of the best boba I've ever had in the US, and is definitely on par with the ones in Asia. Literally ALL of their selections/drinks are superb and delicious! Every drink is made with fresh, quality ingredients and can be customized to your liking. The portions are big and generous too! You seriously cannot go wrong here!!! I personally recommend their: Wintermelon Latte, Fresh Strawberry Milk, Green Milk Tea, and Pink Beauty. This is the one boba place I miss since moving to LA, so HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"The milk tea boba drink from this place is really good and affordable! It was $3.75 for a large (they only have one size for milk teas) but when I went they were doing a promo for this specific drink. So it was probably around $3.50? However, it was a big drink! They also give you a lot of boba and the bobas are just right. Chewy and the right amount of sweetness. 

It is also cool how they have one drink that you can try a sample of. The drink menu is limited - I think it's because they just opened up recently. There is not snack menu so this is strictly just a tea shop for now I guess. The space is quite spacious inside. There are quite a few tables. The lighting is very bright and cold toned. As of right now, this shop does not have any games for customers to play. If you want to hang out and play games with your friends, you need to bring your own.

There is a $5 minimum for cards. If you do not meet the amount there is a .50 cents charge."}
