{"text":"Sadly, I cannot recommend this place and have to give it only 2 stars - 1 star for food and 3 stars for service.   Server was very friendly but we should have been concerned when the place was empty.   We ordered the mole and fish tacos and were extremely disappointed in lack of flavor and value.   The chicken mole only came with plain white rice and had no flavor.  The fish taco had a deep fried piece of fish and a few shreds of cabbage with a some hot sauce.   We are not very picky and have had authentic Mexican in Mexico city several times, so thought it would be authentic and tasty but not elaborate or fancy.  I like to support local businesses but this was too disappointing to give another chance...wish I read reviews prior to going!"}
{"text":"Cosy, friendly staff, lots of delicious options... I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu! I don't even remember what I had, just a smattering of casseroles and lots of mojitos. Definitely the best Mexican I've had in Montreal (which isn't saying much - seems to me there is a deficit of good Mexican food here) and I will definitely going back."}
{"text":"This place is cozy and authentic, they serve the best Mexican food I've ever had (and I've had quite a lot) and the horchata's are delicious! Friendly staff too. Will definitely be coming back here next time we're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The service was absolutely awful. We arrived with only one other family in the restaurant. We ordered and nearly an hour later we where told they ran out of one of our dishes and we would need to place another order. They also neglected to bring out one of our dishes and still had the audacity to charge us.  I personally ordered the chefs specialty, what I got was dried up (and really dry \"beef jerky\" esque) skirt steak. Thrown atop a wilted pile of lettuce, the steak has me sweating and sick to my stomach. I hate writing a bad review for a place, 4 years ago I would have given them 5 stars. But the service and quality of food was so poor, I made an account just to voice my experience today. Hopefully this will be seen by the management, please get back to your roots. I really used to enjoy quality Hispanic food here."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the drinks are amazing. However, for the price paid, service was on the slow side. My water glass was empty more often than not (a key indicator) and the bill took more than 5 minutes to prepare when we were just anxious to pay and leave. Come only if you have lots of patience."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Delivery took two hours! And they don't even bother to call. I'm very disappointed with its services."}
{"text":"The place was cute and festive, service was decent but the food was terrible. I ordered the enchiladas and the chicken was unseasoned. It tasted like plain boiled chicken wrapped in a tortilla. I little of salt and pepper and spices would have been nice. Portion sizes were too small And way way way to overpriced."}
{"text":"I loved my experience there !  The owner, who was very friendly, explained the menu since it was our first time there. We tried the Paloma drink (very sour!) and the mexican-style beer which was definitely an experience! For the food, guacamole is out of this world and my sopa azteca was warm and delicious. My boyfriend tried the stuffed eggplant and the pepper which were both delicious !  I can't wait to go back and try more stuff.  It takes a while to receive the food, so do not go there if you're in a hurry. But it's like you're a guest in a Mexican family and they're cooking a delicious meal for you."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican tacos! A little on the pricey side but best I've had outside of California."}
{"text":"Went with my husband and daughter around 7:30 on a weeknight.  Was told there was a 20 minute wait, which was fine, except there were 5 or 6 empty tables.  I can understand staggering the seating of guests to not overwhelm the kitchen, so I didn't say anything.  30 minutes later we were sat at a table that had been empty the entire time we were waiting.  The waitress was very friendly, the salsa was good.  Also got the guacamole, which was very tasty.  About 15 minutes after we ordered our food, my daughter (who is 4) asked if her food was ready yet.  The waitress brought out her plate within a couple minutes, but we had to wait another 10 or 15 minutes for our own food.  We actually were still waiting for our food to come out when another waitress asked if we were ready for our check.    The food is pretty good - nothing real fancy, and the prices are okay.  We probably will come back and try it again, but the wait time is a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"Bland I`ve had way better Mexican food. The service sucked but they were nice overall ."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times and have never been disappointed. Service is quick, food is served promptly and it tastes great - I tend to order the enchilada combos. Best mojitos in town. It seems like most of the not so fab reviews tend to be groupon related."}
{"text":"My wife and I were excited about there being a new Mexican restaurant in Oakville, but Maria Bonita left us disappointed.  The food was rather bland and everything was missing the final touches.  Taco meat was well spiced, but was lacking any toppings. No hot sauce selection to speak of. Salsa was Herdes brand which is authentic enough, but certainly not great.  Service was OK, but I could hear the cook complaining about our request for some lettuce, cheese and sour cream etc. for the tacos....  I would love this place to succeed, but right now it is not looking likely."}
{"text":"YEAH,  For once, a real mexican restaurant ! Not like all those american-mexicans cheap ones (Carlos & Pepe's, 3 amigos or El Zaziumm). They serve tapas version of their typical meals. Seriously, it's delicious and full of flavours. The service is very personalized and it might be because the restaurant's size; it's very small. You feel like you're a guest at their home. I've been there 3 times and I'll go back anytime."}
{"text":"The food was good and better than most Mexican restaurants in the area. Prices were reasonable. However, the service left a lot to be desired. The menus and table still had food residue on them. This place can go from a 3 star to a 5 star with much better service and a bit more attention to detail. As it currently stands, I don't find it worth it going back. Had they made a better first impression on us, they would have earned themselves repeat customers."}
{"text":"Where did the prior management and its staff go at Maria Bonita?????  My husband and I have gone there for years. We walked in yesterday and their Sanitation Grade says it all 90. Yes 9-zero!!!!  We will never go back. Menu even looked cheesy. So so so sad....."}
{"text":"Recently tried this restaurant and the food was delicious and authentic Mexican food! The staff was very friendly and professional. Found out it has been under new owner and inside has been remodeled to give a more Mexican authentic look. The atmosphere was inviting, casual, and family friendly. On top of delicious food the margaritas were amazing. Can't wait to go back and try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Authentic Flavour. Reasonable Prices.  While so many other places are doing (or trying to do) Mexican 'cause it's hip, or cool, or ironic, or something, Maria Bonita is doing it because, well, they're actually Mexican. The menu is solidly authentic, taking basic Mexican fare up a notch without being over the top.  Definitely a good spot for a quick lunch, but their dinner menu is what really makes a visit worthwhile."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with fine Mexican cuisine. Prices are very low for the quality and quantity. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Once this was our favorite Mexican restaurant.  The food was delicious and management and staff very friendly.  Then a couple of years ago it ended up being full of families with small children and we cut back.  Lately we've been back a couple of times but the food appears to have declined in quality.  We are no longer that bothered with lots of screaming kids and a need to wait for a table.  Evidently we are not the only ones that have noticed the change in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We have tried most of the restaurants reviewed here but keep returning to Maria Bonita - and it's because of the fajitas.  Still have not found any Mexican place that has the seasoning and spices that Maria Bonita has.  Also, the salsa that comes with the chips changes each time we go as it is made on site, and almost all of the time it is fantastic.  Lunch prices are very good compared to the $8 an $9 dishes most South Charlotte places charge."}
{"text":"Quality is top notch and love the selection and authenticity. Ask for a side of plantains!"}
{"text":"Mediocre - that's really the only word that comes to mind. That and salt, but I'll get to that.  Being new to the area, my family and I walked into what seemed to be a quaint, colorful little Mexican joint, and the manager behind the bar welcomed us with a smile and a hello - so we sat down with high hopes.  The servers weren't appreciably engaged with the guests - as noted in other reviews, lots of standing around the register, but our server recommended the Patrone margarita and enchiladas as house specials - my wife ordered fajitas and my son had tacos.  The margarita came in a short rocks glass jammed with ice, and cost $10 - it was gone in 3 sips!  The server was quick to offer another - but at $3.33/sip, I'd rather have water. I asked the friendly server if I could try the enchiladas with a variety of their sauces; white, red, mole, etc - and was told that substitutions are not allowed, and I'd have to order from the menu. (a sign that they're just reheating something cooked at 8am that day and reheated for your pleasure...)  From the chips and salsa (obviously store bought chips, nothing fresh) throughout the entire dinner, everything had about 10 times the amount of salt that it needed. My wife's fajitas were the only passable thing, and barely at that. My enchiladas w/crema sauce were so salty they were inedible, and my son (who can eat a whole bag of potato chips in a sitting) said his tacos were way too salty, stopping at half of one. The fajitas were just as salty as anything else, but copious amounts of avocado and sour cream saved the day, barely.  We sent back plates that were essentially full, and were not asked if everything was alright before the bill was plunked on our table. I'm thinking they must be used to this by now?  We won't return."}
{"text":"We visited Maria Bonita for the first time last night and thought it was pretty good.  We wanted to redeem a restaurant.com coupon that we bought several months ago, but we didn't realize that a recent deal on Living Social/Groupon would make it so busy!  There was a 15 minute wait, but we decided to skip the table and sit at the bar right away.    We ordered some queso and the brie and walnut quesadillas for appetizers.  I wasn't a fan of either, but I know now that I'm fine with their complimentary chips and salsa...both fresh and yummy!  For dinner, I ordered the chicken and steak fajitas, and my husband ordered their \"signature dish\".  I think it was some sort of beef with a ring of pineapple from a can on top.  Apparently, the kitchen was backed up with a big party (maybe 10 people) upstairs and a full restaurant, so we waited quite a while between our appetizers and when we finally asked to just have our entrees boxed up.  It ended up not being that big of a deal, because we were pretty full from the appetizers.    After trying my fajitas at home, I will definitely be back to Maria Bonita to get some.  However, I think I'll call in my order to go next time.  There was plenty of food, and the flavor was so good.  They're not like most fajitas I've had before; there were tomatoes, zucchini, onions, and peppers all cooked in with the chicken and beef.  My husband's beef was pretty good, but not very impressive.    I would definitely recommend going to Maria Bonita, but don't go when you're in a hurry.  And get the fajitas!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Service was warm and friendly too.  The majority of the menu consists of \"small casseroles\" that are shared tapas-style. The casseroles come with (and are eaten with) a generous stack of small, warm tortillas.  We had three casseroles: the pastor con queso, chile nogada, and berenjenas gratinadas along with the azteca soup and quesedilla de chciharron, which was plenty of food for two people. The casserole and the soup were most memorable, and we look forward to returning again to try the other items on the menu. The cactus salad looks particularly interesting!"}
{"text":"The service was very friendly but the food is nothing special.  I had the fajita and it wasn't spicy at all and a little watery. They also charge for every little thing that other Mexican restaurants usually give for free. I wanted to like this place but I just couldn't."}
{"text":"The food was good. Fairly basic though, there wasn't much flavour. I definitely did not get the authentic Mexican feel. Service was very good."}
{"text":"This was really bad. To be fair, our review doesn't include a full meal because we couldn't make it through two \"margaritas\" and stale chips. First thing I noticed were heaters and heater boxes in random places around the restaurant. I decided that I wanted shrimp fajitas but then the chips were so bad, we knew right away that we shouldn't order food here, much less fish. To be polite we ordered margaritas and that was also a mistake. I ordered a skinny margarita and my husband ordered a frozen strawberry. Mine tasted like watered down orange juice and my husband's tasted like a watered down strawberry slushy. It took 15 minutes for the server to come back so we could ask for the check. We were really wishing we'd brought cash by this time. Best part? Guess how much these margaritas cost? $20. Biggest waste of money and we didn't know because they weren't even on the menu. I have a feeling many people walk out which is the reason for the expensive watered down margaritas."}
{"text":"Le service est excellent, les prix sont abordable et la nourriture rappel les plats traditionnels du Mexique. J'ai adoré mon expérience"}
{"text":"Good not great. I got the enchilada crema and the cream sauce was ok but everything else was good. House salsa is very good."}
{"text":"The food from here is pretty good - I'll definitely return ! We got a pitcher of margs, nachos, and we all ordered a different entree which everyone was happy with.   I got the tostadas with mole sauce and it was great. I also tasted some of the burrito my husband ordered and loved that dish. I didn't have the rest of the food but everyone was very happy.   The space is a little cramped but it's cute and the waitstaff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go here. While I was waiting for it to be ready they gave me chips and salsa. I saw ants in the chips and decided not to eat them. Was going to say something to the waitress but no one came back to check on me for a very long time and she seemed so miserable to begin with so I decided not to. When I got home with my food the first thing I noticed when I took a bite was how cold it was even tho I walked in and supposedly waited while it was being made. Then when I started opening up the rest of my food I saw that there were ants crawling ALL OVER EVERYTHING!!! Even the napkins. Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable! I wasn't even able to get my money back. I will never come back. Neither should you"}
{"text":"Full disclosure, we only came here because we had an entertainment book coupon & wanted to try somewhere new.   When you enter, you have to duck under this huge metal staircase that takes up half the restaurant & leads to a small seating area above.  Really bizarre & I'm lucky I'm short because I would have knocked myself out.    After perusing the limited menu I chose ropa vieja, with black beans & fried plantains.  The sauce the meat came in was almost like a bbq sauce & very strange & not very good.  I've had ropa vieja at plenty of cuban restaurants & IN Cuba, I know how it should taste. The only thing I enjoyed were the plantains.  Everything was pretty bland, which I'm not sure is due to the location or what.   Also, my biggest issue with the evening was that Grey's Anatomy was on tv in the dining area, so while I was suffering through my shredded beef in red sauce I had to watch a surgery with blood & gore on a tv because it was directly in my line of site, I would have had to look at the floor in order not to look at it.  Gross.    also somehow our meal came out way higher than it should have been, our check should have been under $15 with the coupon & came out over $28.  So sodas are 5 dollars each??  but I was too tired & grossed out to argue.    Needless to say, NEVER going back!"}
{"text":"Six of us for dinner on Saturday of the oakville jazz festival. Place was humming. Margarita's where awesome. Tried a bunch of the dishes, soups were great, tilapia fish was divine. Decor - Mexican. Food - authentic. Attitude - amazing. Vibe - very real and fun. Will be back often!"}
{"text":"This is not what I come to expect out of MB. It has obviously taken a turn for the worse since it has changed hands. Fajitas were just OK and very bland. Corn tortillas were torn and had to return and replacements were not much better. Both salsa and cheese dip were fair at best. Probably won't return until mgmt changes again."}
{"text":"This place is beyond great! The size is quaint and welcoming. The stuff poblanos were amazing. Loved it!"}
{"text":"We went in for lunch today, and the first thing our waitress says to us after bringing our drink order is, \"We can't bring you chips and salsa, because we are out of salsa...and chips.\"  HUH?!  How in God's name does a Mexican restaurant run out of salsa and chips in the middle of the day?!  We ordered anyway....with great trepidation.  I had the combination lunch fajitas.  Jenny had the quesadilla Lupita.  We were both quite pleased.  The food was good.  The portions were big.  The prices were CHEAP!  By the way....they offered to substitute the salsa and chips with queso dip and flour tortillas.  I guess we made out there as well.  It's close to the house, yet I somehow often overlook it.  The truth is....it's hard to beat the value proposition....at least for lunch."}
{"text":"This place has good food, an array selection of drinks to choose from margaritas are good, from walking in the door you get a sense of a neighborhood restaurant the servers are nice and efficient, definitely a place to try. The avocado shrimp appetizer is very good and the fajitas are my favorite."}
{"text":"I'm officially boycotting Maria Bonita because of my $8 to go cheese dip that didn't come with chips or salsa.   I used to enjoy going in to eat so i might give them another try in the future but for now... :/"}
{"text":"No tacos here!  Cozy corner spot with a little terrace decorated in ranch style.   Dishes are served \"casserole\" style, where each diner picks a few small plates and shares with the table. I sampled the nopales, chille relleno, an excellent pork dish with pineapple and the black beans with cheese. The menu included a selection of at least 15 different casseroles ranging from chiles to chicken, steak and even shrimp. Also a selection of starters and a table d'hôte offering. Chips, salsa, tortillas and toppings included. And of course, margaritas, beer and wine.   Was a fun dunning experience and the food was tasty but it doesn't come cheap. Each dish runs $6-9+, two dishes per person plus a tecate...don't expect to leave for less than $30 a head. That being said, worth a try if you've been searching for that elusive Montreal Mexican food fix!"}
{"text":"This is a really charming place, and they take good care of their customers too.  The waitresses are friendly and the decor is really creative.  The patio is very comfortable and is a great place to sit at sunset.  The food can pretty much be found at any Mexican restaurant, but I will say that the shrimp is better than I've had at other Mexican places.  The margaritas are pretty good too, but nothing I haven't had before."}
{"text":"I am so glad this is not just another Tex-mex place.  Of you want quality/authentic Mexican, this is the place for you.  I have had the fish tacos maybe 4 times now and I love them more every time.  I would definitely come here again. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best Mexican place in Charlotte. Period. I don't know what else to say about it. Salsa is great, queso is amazing, Enchiladas Cremas (spelling?) is incredible. We have stopped trying other Mexican places, what's the point when you have found the best?!?"}
{"text":"I have been to Maria Bonita a few times for lunch.  We normally go just before noon and so far haven't had  much of a wait.  The chips are crispy, warm and fresh.  I think the salsa is good - it tastes freshly made and has good flavor.  They have a good selection of lunch specials which are a good value. In my opinion,  the quality of food here is very good.   The bright decor and open feel of the space makes it warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"I am honestly not sure how they are still in business. We had not been in a year or so and thought we would give it another try.   First of all, the inside is super outdated and just dingy looking. The chips...the chips are truly the worst I have ever had. A bag of Tostitos would have been a huge improvement. Awful. Stale and not good at all. The cheese dip was cold. Completely cold, but somehow still melted. Nasty.   They close (according to their website) at 9pm on a Thursday, but started turning people away at 8:15.   Could be an amazing neighborhood place, but no one was there and now I know why. Will not be back. Awful."}
{"text":"Sorry guys, huge swing and a miss. This is not Mexican food. Had the enchiladas, that's an easy one, the sauce was not good, not even close. And it was thrown together in literally a minute, cold corn tortillas not even bothered to heat up. No cheese on top, and no rice and beans... service was nearly non existent... keep trying Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Good cheap lunch place, standard Mexican food and large portions. Plenty of chips and salsa. Perfect for neighborhood lunch when you want to pig out a bit. If you want something a bit better and you have some Spanish language skills head down to Central Ave. Just pick any of the places with the full parking lots; a few low riders in attendance should be a deciding factor."}
{"text":"This is a first and hopefully the last single star I'll award! We have dined at Maria Bonita's (MB) numerous times but not in the last few years...to much traffic and to many miles from home. We found ourselves in the neighborhood and visited an old standby for quality Mexican food.  Not on this particular evening....most everything just went wrong! Start with the drink special which was a pitcher of premium margaritas. A liter carafe filled to the brim with ice. So much so that our server spilled the ice on the table, on my Bride, on the floor and in the glass but delivered very little liquid into the glass. We filled our water glasses with the excessive ice to find about three drinks. Nothing premium here.  My bride ordered the chicken fajitas and our first observation, when served, was no sizzle! A generous portion of veggies and par boiled chicken. Clearly the veggies had been fried in the skillet but the chicken was added to late to be much more than barely warm and lacking any caramelization.  I ordered the Conchinita Pilbil, a favorite in the past. A generous portion of pork shoulder, well seasoned and slow roasted in banana leaves. At first look, my dinner appeared very familiar. Unfortunately, the meat was COLD....like just out of the refrigerator. Caught the eye of a Manager and shared my problem. He apologized profusely and promised to fix the problem. He stated \"It will take 8-10 minutes because our food is made to order\".   My second order was not as generous, barely warm, no tortillas, rice or the pickled onions; the fried plantains were all but absent. Very surprising the Manager allowed a meal, so poorly prepared the first time, to leave his kitchen without putting an eyeball on a redo?   When the bill was presented, I asked our server if the restaurant had changed hands. He responded about a years ago but stated he was a cook and had been pressed into a servers role. \"We have two new people in the kitchen!\"  No surprise here!  My meal was comped but unfortunately after 93 reviews I was compelled to write my first single star review. No excuse for poor quality food, twice, a server with little experience on the front side of the house and a manager that believe comping mistakes solves the problem.   Best of luck MB and diners beware!"}
{"text":"I wasn't able to use my voucher advertised from yelp disappointed..3rd visit food is good service is good.But need to use my voucher next visit."}
{"text":"Très bon petit resto mexicain dans le Mile End. Les tacos sont dignes de vrais tacos de là-bas, et la sauce verte piquante aussi! C'est tout petit, c'est convivial, il y a des menus midi aussi. Prix très corrects, service très bon! A tester!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. I love sitting on the patio, enjoying chips and salsa and their drink with vodka and limes. I usually get the ensalada de la casa, just be careful because the dressing is SPICY! I also enjoy the enchiladas a la crema if I'm really hungry. Great neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"We were tempted by the billing of authentic mexican cuisine, but both my wife and I were frankly disappointed.  The restaurant used to be CAFE GALLERIA, which we frequented quite a bit (but I guess not that much since they went out of business :).  I think they missed the mark when it comes to the decor.  Granted, it is painted in bright colours (blue, pink, yellow), but there is little in the way that makes you feel you are in an authentic setting.     We were still encouraged, because we figured the food would compensate for the poor decor.  Again, we were disappointed.  My wife and I ordered separate dishes (a fish dish and an enchilada).  Both were extremely bland, and had no real flavour.   I also wouldn't say the serving sizes were overly generous.    On the plus side, the waiter (who I suspect was the owner) is very  nice, and informative, and I truly wish him luck in his business.   But he should really rethink the menu or (no offense intended) get a new cook."}
{"text":"Man, what a night. I had about 8 friends in town and my son and I asked them to meet us at Maria Bonita's. We were seated right a way and within a few minutes our order was taken. There was only four tables seated when we arrived. My son and I ordered first and within a few minutes all orders were taken. I also ordered a drink from the bar. After about 20 minutes meals started coming to the table. Still no drink from bar. Half way through the meal, my son's and my dish still had not arrived. Still no drink. I tried to get the waiter but he was not out by tables. I finally flagged him down and he said it was coming that they were very busy. Again, only four tables filled. Now finally everyone had finished meal and some of the party had to leave because they had small kids, still no meal. I flagged the waiter again and walked to kitchen window. No one spoke English in kitchen so they did not know what I was saying. The waiter finally came up and said since we order last....really?...our dish was still being made. Long story short, never got me dish, never got an \" I am sorry\". the waiter was very rude, it was his fault I think he never turned in ticket for us. He would not tell me his name and kept saying he was the manager. We WILL NEVER go back. it was also very embarrassing for my son and I to have invite our quest and to be treated that way. AWFUL place. Left my name and number for the owners or REAL manager, never heard from anyone,,,,surprise surprise."}
{"text":"$6.00 for cheese dip that's obviously been cut with water to make food cost. $10 for tacos that are not up to par with Taco Bell. Last time for me."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and Wow! The food is excellent!!!  The staff is very friendly and efficient. The restaurant was very clean, including the bathrooms.  Prices are great. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants good quality food."}
{"text":"we went here because of a groupon deal. we had to go twice because we didn't see that the day we chose the first time was excluded (oops). margaritas were good, food was good, portions were large enough to take home for left overs. they have a super delicious dulce de leche cake.  they have this cute little upstairs seating area that you get to via spiral staircase. i want to try sitting up there sometime but the location is too far from us to go regularly."}
{"text":"The place has a weird setup. When we walked in, no one greeted us even though I'm pretty sure the manager was sitting at the front. He was too busy talking with a buddy I guess. When he was ready to seat us, he put is in the corner and had to clear the table off. He made sure he let us know it was the \"servers\" table where they fold their napkins and do silverware. Then the server was a young timid guy that wasn't paying attention to what we were ordered. He took the three orders and when he got to me he just turned around and walked away. He may have been new so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and was pretty kind about this mistake. I had to wait 10 min before he finally came back. He came back twice after that to double check the order was correct. The salsa was good. My meal was bland and very expensive. The worst Mexican food I've had in Charlotte so far. Everyone else in the group had issue with their food. I will not return. It is not worth the money and the service was very disappointing."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Montreal! Friendly, warm service. Homemade taste. So impressive, cozy and no trouble when it comes to accommodating vegetarians."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I was sat at a dirty table only after I waited at the front for several minutes before someone came to greet me. Salsa, chips and food was undesirable. The waiter didn't ask me one single time how my meal was and I had to flag him down anytime I needed something even to pay the check. Will never return."}
{"text":"A horrible little place where one can eat flavorless quasi Mexican food and be baked by the evening sun blasting through the windows.  Staff hangs around their station most likely excusing themselves when a new customer is seated or if they have to serve food.  Their conversations take precedence over anything else.  Wife and I were foolish enough to try it again after our first miserable experience.  Results were the same so at least we confirmed that our experiences here were what one can expect.  If you have no taste buds and don't mind casually going through-the-motions service...this is for you."}
{"text":"The food is good, its a bit hidden but itches the \"scratch\" for Mexican food.   Options in this area are all but non existent"}
{"text":"So terribly disappointed- spent about $50, Friday night- 2 frozen house margarita's & 2 entree's.  I ordered Ropa de Vieja- consists according to the menu of shredded beef, white rice and black beans- a well known Cuban dish. However, delivered to me was shredded beef, Mexican rice and Mexican re-fried beans?! After my meal is over, I ate my shredded beef the waitress finally returns to the table- oh she say's, Mexican rice is all we have- it changed over a year ago?! Like that's an excuse? Change your menu if it's been over a year- 2 of the 3 items on my plate were wrong- no apology, no offer to credit me for the error on their part.  Sad, I thought I'd help out the local establishment- $50 wasted, won't be back & do not recommend."}

{"text":"I loved this place!!! Great medium chunky salsa, super fresh veggies in my homemade corn tortilla fish tacos, and they gave me a bigger salad because I didn't want rice or beans. Was an awesome dinner with great service -- exceptional waitress!! Attentive and very cooperative. Yummy sauce on the fish tacos as well. I also loved the window where you can watch them cooking your food up fresh!  Boyfriend got a combo of beef tacos and chicken quesadilla, he was a big fan and of course the classic rice and beans was spot on.    Great with a groupon, without a deal these prices are just too high. But with a groupon or the Yelp check in, it makes the dinner price just right!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. Authentic Mexican food with an intimate setting and Mexican decor. The best thing is their reasonable prices and a full bar. They are tucked away so not very busy, once they are discovered they will be packed. Nice end of meal treat. Living by the border in Southern California, this brings me home.  Debra Oliver"}
{"text":"Real Mexican food. Good service. Everything is fresh."}
{"text":"Very average Mexican food with average service. I'll stick with my Central Avenue favorites for authentic Mexican for a reasonable price, thank you."}
{"text":"Oh Maria... Like other Yelpers, I really wanted to like this little place.  The shopping center that its located in is very nice, the colors inside are on par for the Mexican feel, but the food was just not cutting it.  When you walk in, there is a huge metal staircase in the middle of the room.  It seems like a neat idea until you have to awkwardly duck under it to get to your table.  I'm surprised there's no foam all over it to prevent terrible disasters.  (Please note: I'm 5'6\", and I had to duck under the staircase.).   Our server was verrrrrry sweet.  The chips and salsa were good.  There was no salt or pepper on any of the tables, so we had to ask for it.  The food though, was not good.  I hate writing poor reviews, so I usually try to sugar coat with \"this was ok\", or t\"hat was fine\", but no.  Unfortunately, the food was just not good.  Everything was greasy and not put together well, creating one big, messy Mexican dish (and not the good, greasy-delicious way).   So, I'm glad that we used a Groupon, and didn't pay full price, but I will not be coming back here.    (I was going to give it 3 stars and maybe another try, until my stomach cramped and I was nauseous the entire next day.  Could have been a terrible coincidence, but I feel like I could have avoided it, had I avoided this dinner.  2 stars for Maria Bonita, and her quesadillas.)"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of authentic Mexican cuisine, this is the place to go! Maria Bonita is run by a family that make traditional Mexican food with love. The aesthetic of this resto is also perfect for a date setting. It's dim but warmly lit with soft Latino music providing you with company during your meal. Furthermore, the service was exceptional and caring. I had a great time.  Maria Bonita serves food in small caserola dishes accompanied with fresh corn tortillas (that are warm and smell amazing!). The caserolas depend on your selection, we asked our host different types of his most popular dishes and he delivered. My favorite was by far the cochonita pibli. You take a tortilla, add your meats/veggies, add cheese and YOU DO THIS OVER AND OVER AND STUFF YOUR FACE UNTIL YOU HATE YOURSELF.  Just kidding but seriously.... the food is really good. I ordered a horchata to go with my meal and it was good.  I mentioned the service being exceptional, it really is. Do ask them to try some of their most popular dishes, you won't regret it.  With a large group, the price-tag was very reasonable. I'd definitely come back if I find myself in the area again."}
{"text":"So, I ordered from this place on Grubhub, so I can't speak to the quality of the service. If it's on par with the food, I'm sure it's terrible as well. I studied the menu long & hard before ordering, and I was impressed that they had typical Mexican dishes you'd be hard pressed to find in other Mexican restaurants (chile en nogada? Heck yeah!) I read the reviews, but didn't take them too seriously. I ordered the cochinita pibil, a yucatecan dish of pork that's marinated in achiote, spices and citrus juices, then roasted in banana leaves. What I got was the Chata brand of cochinita pibil that you can find in a can or a plastic pouch in the \"Hispanic food\" aisle in Walmart. I'm not even exaggerating. For $15? That's a mistake I won't be making twice. Take the reviews seriously; stay away."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years, it's just not the same place... I use to get taco salads quite often but the taste has gone down hill. The other day I ordered a salad with chicken and it was not pretty, not taste bland - lets just say I could have made this in 10 seconds with harris teeter lettuce and chicken LOL - the fajitas were AGIAN bland not really any spice Needed salt and just the service is not up to par. They need to visit CABOS and see how a real Mexican restaurant is run and aura should feel."}
{"text":"I saw the mixed reviews, but I am on a quest  for good Mexican food, so I tried it anyway and was pleasantly surprised. The chips were warm, the salsa was fresh tasting, and there was a chunky vs smooth option. I turned down the offered queso or guacamole and was glad I did, as the menu had them listed at $4-5. My husband got the specialty margarita and it tasted good, though he asked for it frozen and it was a bit chunky (from the sound of the blender, it may be on its way out).  I got the chicken quesadilla and it was no normal saggy tortilla with a wad of cheese - it was over an inch thick, packed with sizzling, well-spiced chicken, roasted veggies, and Mexican cheese. It was warm and comforting. I love refried beans and these were no exception, though they were more of a sauce/liquid consistency than I am used to. I used them to add another flavor to my quesadilla. Husband got one of the more authentic specialties and cleaned his plate before I could try it. It seemed obvious that not many people order dessert - the waitress brought our check before offering dessert. We got the tres leches cake and that was the one part of the meal that did not live up to the rest, as it seemed pretty store-bought and assembled (though still tasty). Overall, it's not our #1 for Mexican, but it was a solid choice and I would go back."}
{"text":"Maria Bonita is a small little Mexican eatery, tucked away on Casgrain in the Mile End area.  They  make their own corn tortillas and offers items such as quesadillas, sopes, ceviches, soups, salads, and entrees such as mole poblano con pollo, rajas con crema, and bistec a la mexicana.  The hubs and I stopped by to pick up some quesadillas to-go, as I'd heard that they were quite addicting.  We weren't given a menu, so it would have been nice to know that there were different types available.  I just ordered the one with cheese; there was a generous amount of cheese within the corn tortilla, which was folded in half.  Just one piece, with a small cup of sweet salsa, just under $5.  The salsa did not help, so eating on its own was more preferred - maybe hot sauce?  I thought it was a little pricey for something so simple.  Staff were super friendly, and the restaurant itself is adorable - love the decor and the way that they have the authentic shawls on the tables as covers.  There is a minimum for CCs.  +overpriced quesadillas +friendly staff +cute decor of the interior"}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened to this place. It has gone way down in quality and appearance. We won't be back. Food was bland and really not good. A brown tone to everything. We enjoyed the chips and the cheese dip, but the salsa was red water. Yuck. There are too many places to choose from in Charlotte and this one is not worth your money."}
{"text":"Sub par Mexican food. Rice and beans that came on the side of my fajitas looked like it cMe out of a can and was cold. The fajitas were okay but the amount of vegetables to chicken ratio was not worth 12.00"}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves a better rating than it has so far, unless we just got lucky and ordered the right thing! However, I suspect that people in our area are not familiar with Mexican food and perhaps more familiar with Tex Mex. the queso fundido was not particularly special, though the cheese was good quality and the tortillas were fresh and homemade. The margarita was quite good, and my husband liked that they had Mexican Coke. The real star of the show was the fajitas. My husband had the steak, and I had the chicken. Again, warm, fresh tortillas and simple but fresh sides... Sour cream, cheese, and romaine lettuce. The fajitas were nicely seasoned with good portions of meat and accompanying veggies (peppers and onions).   In addition, the owner and his wife were nice and helpful. The service was good, and they were welcoming. We will be back the next time we're craving Mexican."}
{"text":"Used to be good food . recently new management took over. Unfortunately it has been down hill since.the fresh good is gone, non decsript  mush has replaced it.too bad,I won't be going there again.."}
{"text":"I was so happy to check this place out this weekend, it's one of those kinds of places you notice tucked away on a side street and think looks so sweet for years but somehow the timing doesn't work out or you forget and time goes by without you trying it. And then you do, and it's even better than you'd mythologized it in your mind. It's not trendy, it's classic. Dim and warmly lit it's perfect for romance or for any kind of happy soothing hangout. It's run by a family who make traditional Mexican food lovingly and with care. They serve small dishes that are kind of like casseroles, and warm fresh corn tortillas which you fill with the cheesey goodness from the casseroles making fresh tacos.  About two casseroles per person is perfect, and if, like us, you just want to try the best of everything, you can ask them to bring you a sampling of their most popular dishes, saving you the trouble of deciding so you can focus on the delicious work of eating. I really look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"We walked in..and sections of the restaurant had no lights turned on and we thought it was closed til the owner told us he was open and sat us at a table. My bf ordered Enchiladas and I ordered the Nachos with out the Peppers and the owner made me feel uncomfortable for not ordering everything on the dish.. We got our food, and the enchiladas was so oily and not plated very well. It was just a mess on the plate. My nachos came and when it tasted good, however nothing special. The nachos were SOGGY!!! Barely any pieces of nacho chips were crunchy and I didn't enjoy it. Owner kept standing nearby and looking at us eat..and it made me uncomfortable because I couldn't eat my food in privacy and comfort. The chef looked unhappy, and the owner is a nice guy, but for $30..I would eat somewhere else. I've had better Mexican food."}
{"text":"We brought daughter and several friends for end-of-schoolyear dinner. This is really a \"mexican tapas\" joint -- everything is small plates, you get a couple for each person, and you can share everything around. This was a real treat vs. the usual tex-mex approach...and the food was better. Everything we had was fresh, several were very good and the rest were at least pretty good. The service was attentive and friendly. One of the waiters talked us back after we were about to order what he thought was too much food -- he was right, we ended up with a great variety and just the right amount. Nothing really blew us away, hence not a 5-star, but everything was very good and overall a totally worthwhile experience."}
{"text":"The shrimp and cheese dip appetizer is OUT OF THIS WORLD delicious. As were the Patron margaritas :)"}
{"text":"Wow, I decided to try out the place just because we where driving by it. Didn't review on Yelp. WHAT A MISTAKE! No one greeted us. There where two waiters, one extremely shy and the other so rude. The chips where stale and the pico de gallo was to very spicy, that my daughter could not eat. I asked for the non spicy version and the rude waiter said that it wasn't spicy. Ok, if you say so. With an attitude he came back with warm MOLE, which I dislike. How is that the Pico de Gallo non spicy version. Anyway, he again said the other wasn't spicy. At that point I was getting upset, I told him I am the customer and he cant tell me its not spicy. I told our party lets go, this is not going well, and he said YES Lady best you go!!!! Argh!!! Really, I was looking to have a nice dinner, not fight over sauce. So, rude and ridiculous! NEVER, EVER again. Don't waste your time, and if you do. Get ready."}
{"text":"In Canada and Montreal authentic Mexican food so hard to come by. I mean we have been so polluted with Tex-Mex in this county that people think that Doritos, salsa and chicken soft tacos, burritos are Mexican food. So is a real refreshing discovery to have the experience to enjoy this little diddy for an organized group dinner. As you enter the restaurant you have the feel that it's going to be a special meal. The lighting is dim yet cozy. Soft music plays in the background and you have the feel that you are in for an authentic treat. We had a look at the menu but not knowing many authentic dishes we asked for a sample for all of us to enjoy. For me I'm no Mexican food expert but I do know a place that serves multiple mole dishes plus many items I have not head about must be the real deal.   To get the party started I ordered a lime margarita. This I believe was a good starter drink to test how they prepare it. It came with coarse salt a nice mix of lime and tequila not overly sweet but well balanced between the salty rimmer and the tart yet sweet mix plus the blend of Tequila. Then small plates of fresh warm corn tortillas came out as small dishes of different taster plates covered our table. Everything had a very distinctive yet vibrant flavour and you could eat away till your tummy said \"no more\". The dishes are smaller here so not overly filling, not extremely heavy but yet freshly prepared. The ones I really enjoyed were the : The mole poblano con pollo. The cochinita pibil was a pork and corn based banana leaf wrapped steamed tamale with delicious mild banana leaf and cornmeal flavour. For those that like cheese, the Pastor con queso is amazing! Most of the dishes I didn't find very spicy but different than I have eaten before at any Mexican restaurant. No dish I sampled would I deem bad. Everything was excellent. I must come back and sample more. Thank you. Exquisite."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy going here on occasion, but we don't like going when everyone has their groupons to use. I wish they would avoid running the groupons, as the restaurant doesn't have the large kitchen to keep up with the orders when they get packed. This is when we pay regular prices and enjoy our food,  but hear the grouponers complain about every little thing possible. It's comical, and I feel bad about the staff.   Their food has been consistently good, and service is friendly."}
{"text":"Yikes!!   I've never heard of this place but I saw the decent reviews and wanted to give it a try. Came here on a Friday night and they maybe had 7 tables including us. The restaurant is very small. When we walked in we were greeted by a man with a jacket on and he told us we could sit wherever we want. I don't like it when people do that. We were new and not familiar with this place at all. We walked our way to a corner booth and noticed it was still dirty. He picked up the stuff from the table and walked off. He never came back to clean the table.   We waited 15 mins before we were greeted. No one said they would be with us. We were ignored. There were 3 servers including the bartender to attend the 7 tables. We were seriously about to walk out and leave. Finally the server came and apologized. We ordered our drinks. My husband got a beer and she gave him the wrong one. I asked her if she could clean the table when she gets a chance and she touched it and could tell it was sticky. We finally ordered and she cleaned the table. The chips they served us were cold and stale. How is that possible?   While we were waiting, there was a tv in front of us and it was nothing but infomercials. Like why? Change it to anything but that. There is a little window where they put the food out and ring a bell for someone to run it. I saw my food sitting at the window getting cold. The heater up top was not turned on. My husband got the fajitas and after a bit, his fajitas were ready. But our food was still sitting there.   We finally got served and my food was cold. I got two hard shell tacos and a burrito with rice and beans. My tacos were super soggy and wet front the burrito sauce. The rice and burrito were good. The beans looked good but since they were cold I just couldn't eat it. I also found a piece of plastic in my beans. Looks like from their plastic bags they give out. My husband wasn't crazy with his fajitas. They were super bland and lacked flavor. His rice and beans were also cold. We needed drink refills and never got anything. Our server literally took our order and served our food and never came back to check on us. I was so over it I didn't mention the plastic. The table behind us found hair in their food.   This place has a lot of potential but it's just not worth it for us. One plus about this place is that they give a lot of salsa."}
{"text":"There needs to be a negative star rating. This is the first and last visit. Horrible service and food. Waited forever and the order was wrong. Food was cold. Told the manager (that stayed on her cell phone most of the time we were there)and all we got was an \"I'm sorry\". Noticed an employee drinking a beer while working. Half the tables got up and left while we were there. This is the worst restaurant I've been to in a long time. The worst mexican restaurant I've been to ever. Even though our order was wrong and the food was cold still charged us for everything except a $4 discount. I can't believe this place is open for business."}
{"text":"I visited Maria Bonita last night I read the reviews some good n bad.  But I like to see for myself sometimes, I was disappointed. First  they were not busy when we arrived at all and we had to wait while they cleaned a table. That was okay, we sat upstairs, they told us that they had a big party upstairs and hadnt cleaned up yet!!  They cleaned a table for us and we were the only ones upstairs, through our whole meal they never cleaned any other tables!!!    I had the chicken Quesadilla, Queso dip, my friend ordered a margartia and the chicken Mole.  The margarita had to much salt and had more sweet n sour mix than tequila.  My Quesadilla was okay the sour cream that was suppost to come with it and guacamole was on top of some skippy lettece and some rice.  The chicken Mole was bland with no kick or flavor.  There were no drink specials or special dishes of the day.  As we were waiting for our bill my friend looked over and saw a check laying on the table beside of us of which still hadnt been cleaned gross.  The person had left their credit card we told our server so they could call the person or put it in their safe.  Now how long would that have sat there or what if a dishonest person sat there and took it!!  I was not impressed with Maria Bonita at all, nothing beats Don Pedros so far :)"}
{"text":"Was on a hunt for some good Mexican food. Came across this restaurant on Yelp; therefore, we decided to check this place out. I blame all those amazing pictures of the food on Yelp. It's a tapas place. We ordered sesame chicken, eggplant with cheese and nachos with guacamole. The guac was super yum! Sesame chicken was alright. And the eggplant tasted flavourful but was undercooked. Not sure if I would go here again because it's also a bit far from where I live. The customer service was really good. Upon asking I shared some honest feedback on the eggplant which was taken as constructive criticism. It looked like a family owned restaurant. The place is a bit small and kind of cute.  The service made up for the ok-tasting food :)"}
{"text":"Horrible meal and clueless service. Not to mention the piece of plastic found in my meal. Would never go back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  This is our local Mexican and we go here a lot.  Food, service and drinks are always spot on and I don't need to look for any other Mexican in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I went to Maria Bonitas on a recommendation from a Montreal Blog. We are from DC and needed to find good food in a new city. I could not recommend Maria Bonitas more!!! It was the only place we went to twice. We miss it and wish we had a restaurant like it in the DC area. Their choriqueso was phenomenal. Their mole chicken was perfect. They have their pineapple pork wrapped in a banana leaf that I still think about weekly. I know it'll be my first stop next time we head to Montreal."}
{"text":"I've been coming here off and on over the past 10+ years and I get the same thing every time, the burrito vegetales with tomatillo sauce, it's on the lunch menu. I wish they would continue their more authentic menu but at least they didn't change the one menu item I go crazy over! If you're not sure what to get, I suggest this!"}
{"text":"I like Maria Bonita. The couple that owns it are great. The food is... a 3 at best. It's authentic recipes but pretty light on the spice. I don't just mean \"hot\" but spice in general. It feels that they have toned things down for a downtown Oakville pallet? But it is a bit disappointing. Though for Oakville, this is as good as it gets for Mexican :)"}
{"text":"We had a great experience last night. Service was great..food was awesome. We will definitely be back!! Arroz con pollo was yummy, the queso with the shrimp and Pico was too good..homemade salsa was a little spicy but very flavorful and fresh. Also tried the shrimp and avocado appetizer that was fantastic as well. The only thing I would change is the lighting...it was REALLY bright in there ...just a slight dimming would've been nice. Other than that minor preference on my end...it was great!"}
{"text":"Wed: 1/2 price Margaritas.  Thur: 1/2 price bottles of wine.  Sun: $2 domestics.  I came here because there was a groupon and it was close to my house.  When walking in there was not a whole lot of seating.  The only place they offered to us was two seat high top next to the stairs.  There was some seating upstairs but it was definately out of the way.  My fiance and I chose to sit at the bar which was comfortable.  However there was no bartender.  The woman that was our waitress did not pay us a lick of attention even when near.  She served me the wrong beer and did not give it a lime.  I had to ask other servers for things a few times.  I was going to ask her for some hot sauce but I felt lucky I got another beer.  Enough about the service lets get to the food.   The chips were fresh and the salsa was chunky.  I got a flank steak which was their \"house specialty\".  The steak was good it was marinated in some tropical fruit and came out quite nice.  The beans were average and the rice was a little dry.  My fiance got a chili rellano.  That was good too.  None of the food was outstanding but I left satisfied with what I ate.  The food is about a three and the service was a zero.  I hope we just got a bad server on a busy night.  If there is another groupon I may go back to check out the half price margaritas.  Other than that I have no intention on going back."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been here and most likely won't be back. They seem to be under new ownership/management. To start my order came out wrong, not the kitchen's fault, server wrote it down wrong. Several minutes later, the right entree comes. Dinner is fine - not as good as I remember. When the check comes, now I've been double charged for queso. The check gets taken care of, but no visit from a manager, no comp of a margarita, nothing tangible to apologize for a bad experience."}
{"text":"If you don't mind waiting a bit for your meal, this is probably the most legit Mexican food you'll find in Montreal. Each of the taco plates come in little casserole dishes with a basket of soft taco shells on the side, so unlike other taco joints, you have the ability to portion control. I got one order of the cactus tacos and another of the shrimp: both were superb, and ample for one person. Granted, I filled up on guacamole first, but you probably will too so we're cool.   Warning: these guys are not messing around with their hot sauce. Use it with caution."}
{"text":"Really good. Local, small, delicious cheap Mexican food. We usually order from here for takeout. The chips were fresh, warm, and crispy. The salsa wasnt too hot, nice bite.  Margaritas were perfect! They were 4 bucks! I ordered the chimichanga combo and we got 2 chimichangas and it came with rice and beans and a salad with guacamole. The chimichanga was delicious! I asked for steak inside instead of ground beef. It was tender and flavorful. The cheese over the top was almost like a cheese sauce. Really good! The rice wasn't bland like most places. It had great flavor. Beans were creamy and delicious. My bf had the burrito and taco with rice and beans. He loved it. We ordered the Churros for dessert. Great flavor, a little overdone but good. Great price for what we got!! Will definitely go back. It's quite the gem!!! Ole!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go to Mexican restaurant it was delicious great margaritas amazing atmosphere sure the acoustics on the inside weren't that great but the food was always great as was the service. But boy has there been a slide first off the food it's just not good anymore the margaritas are great and so are the chips but it's no longer worth the trip from Waxhaw! Such a shame!"}
{"text":"Fast, consistent, delicious. SO happy to have this place nearby. Fresh salsa with a little kick. Serving sizes that you don't feel bad finishing, but that can also be split into two meals."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to even write this review! We frequented this place often then the summer got busy and  after not coming for a while, when we walked in we knew right away after walking in  it had been sold and was under new ownership. Sat down, chips came and half were chewy- raw not left in the fryer long enough. Ordered the chorizo cheese dip, about 5 pieces of chorizo in it. Got a house margarita - worse then the chips - pure store bought mix- sugary- not even homemade style margarita mix. Ordered a skinny margarita with a shot of melon liquor in it thinking it would be better and it came out as melon liquor and soda water in a tall glass and they charged 10.00 for the skinny margarita plus an additional 7.95 for the melon liquor in it! 18.00 for melon liquor and soda water!!!! Food came - even worse, I got arroz con polo - it was mushy brown rice with bagged frozen veggies on top, freezer burned Lima beans and all. Save your money, don't go, make ride down Carmel to Cabo's."}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexican place. The shredded beef is a must... I highly reccomend the ropa vieja w/black beans and plantains. The meat is super tender and has excellent flavor, well seasoned black beans and plantains are nice and crispy and sweet. I love their cheese chili rellano as well, the combo plate is the way to go with cheese chili rellano, shredded beef burrito and chicken taco.. the best of everything. The service is good, they are quick and its a good place to sit and chill. I will say to avoid Sunday lunch unless you have kids and are headed there after church. Went this past sunday and kids were running around like crazy... wasnt very relaxing, there was also a wait."}
{"text":"Maria Bonita's es muy bueno!   We started off a little rough, the hostess seemed to be more worried about how she looked then whether or not we were getting sat but we worked through it.  We sat down and were there for about 15 minutes before any drinks were served and before the chips and salsa made an appearance.  That may not seem like a big deal but in the mexican restaurant food world, it is!  You just grow to expect the heaping pile of chips and salsa to magically appear within moments so you can eat the entire basket, ask for more and fill up completely before your main meal is served.  That's just obvious!  The same hostess was tasked with getting our drink order and that was as far as it went...she took the order but then never appeared again.  Thankfully, a bright-eyed, super friendly server surfaced and he turned the whole experience around!  :)  The salsa was on point--so fresh and so clean clean.  Did I just quote part of an Outcast song from 1998, yes, yes I did.  Anyway, I love the fact that the salsa was in a huge bowl.  Normally whoever I am dining with gets in my way when I am dipping my chip but this bowl had room for 4 dippers!  Plus, I didn't feel like a little pig by having to ask for more salsa every 30 seconds because it was used up on the first two chips..\"cough cough-Azteka.\"....anyway, moving on...  The other thing I liked about Maria Bonita's is they had huge portions!  I know most mexican restaurants do but this was different.  The burritos were HUGE but packed with all types of goodies...veggies, cheese, beans, meat.  It held up well and had good substance.  The fajitas were good..no broccoli but not just salty onions and peppers so that was good.  They had zucchini, onions, peppers, and mushrooms.    Overall--very satisfying experience.  I would return.  The atmosphere is nice, pretty cozy and not super \"loud\" like some other local mexican restaurants tend to be.  There was no Mariachi band so that was clutch!  The location is a little brutal.  On the way there my husband kept asking what side of town we were on and I couldn't really explain it!  It is just one of those \"in the middle of nowhere\" type locations...like Quail Hollow.  It isn't on the way to anything really and the shopping center is nice but nothing to write home about.  They did have a couple other bars, shops, etc in the area so you can definitely make a night of it if you want.  I'd return!"}
{"text":"I, like Caitlin, am on a hunt for great Mexican food. So, upon arriving, I was a little surprised at the set-up of the restaurant, very strange. Stairs appear upon entering the doors w/ about 10 tables behind it. There was one other table during lunch and the service was a little slow. I was served chips and salsa, chips were fresh & the salsa had a nice kick..one I like. I chose the lunch chicken fajitas, perfect size. The fajitas were sizzling and served with peppers, onions, tomatoes, and zucchini with a plates of rice & beans, guacamole, and sour cream. Everything tasted great, but I missed a little Mexican flavor in the fajitas. Overall, it was good and my check was less than $10.00, great price!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of mole sauce and Maria Bonita did not disappoint. The chips and salsa were above average, and the guacamole was great. The food portion was generous, but the quality of food was superb. The staircase in the middle of the restaurant is definitely awkward, and the bar seems to be more like the management business/paperwork area, making it undesirable to sit there. The waitress was very good and on point. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Really delicious and one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants you'll find in Montreal.  I used to live in New Mexico and it was so nice to eat authentic dishes in the traditional dishware.  Lovely little family-owned restaurant with great and friendly service."}
{"text":"I was really really hoping to like this place (reviews that start out this way are never good). It is in a great location for us and I do like the shopping center that it's in. But once you walk through the doors you have to be careful not to get a concussion from the low hanging, steel stairs that you must walk under to access the dining room. The prices are reasonable but the food is not. The waitress was very nice and the chips and salsa were very good. I had two tacos and a burrito and they were not good. My wife had chili reano and the enchilada and both were pretty terrible. Our daughter had a steak Quesadilla but it was nothing worth writing more about. You may want to try it if you're close, hungry and have a Groupon. Otherwise places like La Unica have nothing to worry about."}
{"text":"Lovely find in downtown Oakville.  Maria is a delightfully friendly hostess, and the food is fresh and tasty. It's not hard to imagine you're in Mexico City once you're inside the doors and inside the cozy confines of Maria Bonita.  Tonight we had steak fajitas, chicken enchiladas with green sauce, and sides of rice, refried beans, guacamole.  All very fresh and very good. Lime pie for dessert was the perfect light and tasty finish.  The margaritas were great too!  We will definitely return"}
{"text":"My only complaint about this place is that it doesn't marinade either the chicken or the steak for the fajitas. If it was marinated in lemon and lime juice and garlic etc. with just a little salt, the flavor would be so fantastic and also the meat would be more tender. Every time I go in there's a huge problem with how hard and tough the protein is. Please start marinating your protein. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Thought we'd give this place another try since it's close by. THREE IS NOT A CHARM... Consistently poor service. Every time there is hardly anyone here, so there's really no excuse for the pitiful service and exorbitant amount of time to get 2 tacos and 1 bean enchilada. Won't be back again."}
{"text":"I have a fairly crappy memory, so I prefer to write reviews while I'm here. I have never been here and decided to drop by with my girls (aka Crickettes) to check it out. Very friendly and not busy at all. Sat us right away exactly where we wanted. They have the children's menus on the back of a couple of kids' books which is awesome. Chips are typical and sauce is smokey but not very spicy. They did offer mild for the Crickettes immediately. Didn't have to ask. Awesome. Oh and the coup d'état... They have paella!!! You do have to wait a little longer... about 25 min. Probably not the best idea when dining as the only adult with two small children. Ok. Got my paella. I would say 3.9/5 stars. But since it is 1 of 2 restaurants in town that serves paella.... I'll take it and I'll be back. Oh... Worth mentioning: Sandra was pretty axing considering she was new."}
{"text":"This place is OK; I go there occasionally. The food comes out way too fast to be cooked-to-order.  Maria Bonita comes standard with your standard Mexican restaurant fare on the menu, as well as the canned Mexican music (although I understand this place has live bands for certain occasions like Cinco de Mayo).  It is clean and has nice decor.  There is upstairs and patio seating, as well as a bar.   Maria Bonita is located in the neighborhood shopping center at Rea and Colony, across from Burning Tree.  It is on the Walgreen's end."}
