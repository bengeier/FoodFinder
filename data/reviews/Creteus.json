{"text":"I don't know, I just don't know!  Fellow yelpers have given this place a 4 and I feel outta place giving it 2 stars.

Portions are big but I'm just not sure about the quality.  Maybe because it's attached to a gas station, maybe not?  

Kinda strange setup, you walk into the gas station, order and pay for your order at the gas till and wait by the cooking station.

I had ordered the lamb dinner plate, the meat didn't taste fresh, rice was like uncle ben's and the potatoes had a strange film on it.  I didn't get sick or anything from it but it's not something I would want to go back to anytime soon.  Maybe we just came here at the wrong time?

I do echo another review about the microwave, I didn't see what was being nuked but definitely heard the familar beeps.  They have a giant cook top and just don't get what needs to microwaved."}
{"text":"I love this place, such a hole in the wall.  Very odd to get Greek food at the gas station.  But, the food is great!! Love the chicken souvlaki! I agree with the other poster, skip the more expensive restaurants, this is the place for good food!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is always delicious and the salads are made with super fresh ingredients. The prices are really good too. 

My only complaint would be that they don't put hardly any feta cheese on their Greek salad and only 1 olive. One time I got two! Other than that though, this place is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"The most interesting part about Crete Souvlaki is that it's attached to the OK Gas Bar. I've heard that it has changed owners and has gone downhill. However, as I remember it, Crete was a good place to grab a quick bite. Nothing fancy (your order comes in a styrofoam container or plate, and you dig in with plastic utensils), but you get your food in under 10 minutes, it's hot, and covered with delicious, creamy tzatziki."}
{"text":"great good with great price ! I ordered so many times and I have very good experience  ! my favourite is tz source  and greek salad !!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place is in a Gas station and No it doesn't taste like it belongs in a Gas station. Crete is a nice little place that has great Greek food.

It feels like you are sitting in the middle of a convenience store, probably because you are, but the food was amazing. I recently went on a road trip and we stopped here for lunch, they had a small tv playing the Olympics and we ate while people went in and out paying for gas. You can't really go wrong no matter what you order but make sure you get extra tzatziki!"}
{"text":"Incredibly cheap and tasty!  The service was incredibly quick and you get free delivery if you order over $15 and live in the nearby delivery area.

Their falafel wrap is incredibly fresh and is a ton of food for the price!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why this establishment gets four and five star reviews, perhaps other than there are not enough Greek food choices in the area? And only one \"$\"? This is not an affordable fast pick up food place anymore, it is looking now more like \"$$\". The owner has been increasing the prices in the menu for as much as 50% at once, which is outrageous for a gas station fast food joint, things like this offer no value whatsoever to their customers."}
{"text":"You can't say you don't get your money's worth.  If there is a better deal in town I'm not aware of it.  I had the lamb souvlaki plate for $11.99.  You get a generous plate of lemon potato, rice cooked in chicken broth and a Greek salad.

Quality?  The roast potato is cooked just right, and the lemon yogurt sauce has enough herbs to make it interesting.  The salad ingredients are fresh and crispy, but I can't tell if the feta is goat or cow milk.  I like the rice because it doesn't try to overwhelm you with spices and salt.  In fact the salt content in everything is nicely low.

But wait, there's more.  On top of all that you get a warm lamb pita.  The lamb was hiding underneath but it was worth the search.  Can't tell if it was fresh or frozen but it was tender and moist, not at all overcooked.

A very Mediterranean offering that avoids the salt, fat Nd sugar that so dominates most fast food.  If you want to have a meal out that doesn't attack your arteries, this is the place.

Yeah, it's in a gas station."}
{"text":"This is a fun quirky, uber casual place. You pay for your meal at the convenience store counter before eating. They have a huge screen tv with sports or whatever.. playing (not a fan of tv while dining). They offer a variety of dishes including souvlaki and souvlaki wraps as well as skewers.Their offerings have been, tasty, homemade and consistently good. If casual greek is your thing this place might do the trick. :-)"}
{"text":"This place is actually delicious. I love the lemon potatoes!!!! It's so awkward to eat in though because you feel like you're eating in a gas station... which is what it is... lol. I love the one cook there, every time I go in he calls me \"sweetie\" and gives me extra tzatziki dip :) I haven't had anything gross come out of this place. And the price is great."}
{"text":"Really not good. Nobody is Greek there anymore. They warm everything with the microwave don t think that they cook in the house. They bought most of them food from a Greek factory then warm in the house..
I wish it was good.."}
{"text":"Okay - so here's the deal. My first experience with this place was horrific as I explained in detail in an earlier review - so why would I even give it a second chance? Well I didn't want to but we were stuck for a place to grab a bite before a soccer game in the field across the street. Needless to say, I think from my star rating you can see that I had a much better experience.

The service was still quite crap, I couldn't even tell if the staff spoke English because of their non-stellar communication skills. Luckily the food spoke to me. 5$ for a yummy Chicken Souvlaki wrap? and I'm pretty sure as long as you don't get your food delivered to the opposite side of the city it will be fresh, warm and quite delicious. I would definitely pick up a couple of wraps or plates to go if I were nearby. I saw a bunch of people coming in and out for pickups so. Seems like they've got the right idea."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from them and from what I thought would be \"free delivery\" for orders over $30, I got billed $15 for delivery even though my bill was $40. When you add the tip in, I paid close to $70 for $40 worth of food.The food was average and I was not given any pita bread like I was expecting to get.  I called to ask why I got billed for delivery and was told that I wasn't within the \"free delivery\" area...so me being 7km away makes me out of the delivery area? They told me to call back to talk to their manager if I had concerns about the delivery because they could not do anything for me. I will never order from here ever again. Big thumbs down... horrible, horrible, horrible!"}
{"text":"Outside of Greektown in Toronto this is the best Greek food I've ever had.  Its an oddball place being in a gas station but it is fantastic.  Best to get your food to go since the seating area isn't the greatest."}
{"text":"I've only tried their spanakopita, and it was...okay. Flavourful, but the texture could be better; the phyllo seemed on the soggy side, but that's probably because I stopped by late-ish (around 7PM) and maybe it had been sitting in the display case for a while. I do like the convenience of being able to walk over from my son's Taekwondo class to grab a quick snack while I wait for the class to finish. Friendly, pleasant service."}
{"text":"I cant rave enough about this souvlaki place; having the desire for calamari one afternoon and not wanting to cook, I thought about Crete's.

Lo and behold they did have take out and if you order more than 20 dollars worth of food, delivery is free.

Nonetheless, you know I went and done it, delicious mouth watering calamari, the lamb souvlaki and two huge orders of bakalava, my food was ready and in less than thirty minutes was at my doorstop.

This place is a must have foodie for you foodies out there."}
{"text":"It's a gas station, no it's a souvlaki place... no really, it's a gas station! Nuh-uh. It's a souvlaki place! Ok ok, it's both.

GB Fuels is unique. It's an independent service station... with a souvlaki joint attached. Fill up with gas, then grab a menu and order your lunch to go!

Seriously, it's unique. And cheap. I popped in for lunch last week. I ordered lamb souvlaki and platter at the cashier (yep, same place you'll pay for that gas) and then went to wait for my food. A nice big separation between the food and the money. No worries there! And for just over $10. So much food. I was stuffed the rest of the afternoon.

The really gigantic big screen TV threw me a little. Is this a big draw for this place? I'm not so sure... they don't serve alcohol, but perhaps a little soccer with your souvlaki is the way to go?

At any rate, great little lunch spot! And four hundred times better than popping into a franchised three-letter version-not that they're bad, just GB is local AND awesome, so they win."}
