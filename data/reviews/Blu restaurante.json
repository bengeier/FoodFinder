{"text":"Came for winterlicious yesterday despite the snow warning. From the first look the outside made the restaurant look small but after walking inside is when it opens up. Decor and ambiance are very sexy and intimate with the dim lighting and even the guitarist even though he played more pop songs and Beatles. Food wise it was decent.  Nothing really blew me or my friend's mind but at the same time it wasnt bad. I ordered the beef carpaccio which could have used more flavour. The short rib agnolotti had a bit too much oil on it in my opinion but the beef was seasoned nicely. For dessert, the pear was good but they gave me a fork and spoon to cut into it. I personally don't like making sounds of my spoon or fork hitting the plate when using them to cut the pear. The waiters were very friendly and helpful as they would frequently come over just to make sure everything was okay and to refill our water glasses. Complimentary coat check as well."}
{"text":"I had the filet and it was cooked perfectly.  My husband the lamb and they were delicious too.  We had great service and the live music was awesome."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends on a Friday night. The place is really cozy and high end. 
Food portion is very small. I don't think it's a good idea to share anything with friends. Food itself is tasty.  But it's pricy too compared to other Italian restaurants in Woodbridge. 
My favorite is the lamb. Vey tender and juicy. 
Service is excellent. 
Other than that, nothing really impressed me a lot."}
{"text":"I love Blu! We've been going there regularly for the last few months since I found it last summer. I love getting the table by the front window - it's really pretty and great for people watching as well. The food is very good, well portioned and with quality ingredients. 

It's a very cozy atmosphere and the decor is nicely understated.

The owner, Alfredo, is usually on site and makes an effort to get to know regular customers. He will always stop by the table and say hello and ask how you are. The staff is also very personable and friendly.

There is usually live music Thursday onwards and they always take requests."}
{"text":"Blu is directly across the Four Seasons.  Lovely ambience.  Small intimate setting. Wonderful food.  Shared pear and Gorgonzola salad, lamb meatballs and Sea Bass with my spouse. All were excellent.  Wait staff was adequate but not exceptional.  All in all a great meal."}
{"text":"Expensive, slow service, small portions, good tasting food. Decor is stone walls with mirrors, candles, table cloths. Lunch for two around $100 with no appetizers or desserts. ($11-19 for small glass of wine)."}
{"text":"Blu Ristorante, located in the heart of Yorkville at 17A Yorkville, is an Italian restaurant based on authentic classic cuisine created by executive chef Massimo Callovini.

The restaurant is made up of a stone walled, dimly lit interior, both elegant and romantic. There was a live pianoist playing, reminiscent of an extremely well-executed fine dining experience and a refreshing change from the typically loud bustle of other restaurants in the area.

The good: The menu had a good variety of appetizers, pastas and meats. The Truffled Beef Carpaccio ($16) and the Grilled Calamari ($14) were both cooked to perfection. The beef was sliced very thinly with pickled mushroom, crispy capers, crostini and parmigiano. The grilled calamari was infused with pepperonata, olives, capers, chilli olio and argula.

The Bad: It's a pretty pricey restaurant, but it is in the heart of Yorkville.

The Crowd: 30-somethings enjoying a nice relaxing night out with a group of friends, or the perfect date night for just about anybody. photo-2

Overall: The restaurant is very cozy, initimate and charming; the perfect place for a date night. The food, atmosphere and service were amazing. The servers gave us the right attention and the food came quickly so we still had time to enjoy a Friday night out on the town!

Pricing:  $14-16 for martini's, $10-20 for appetizers, & $20-30 for entrees

{"text":"I ate here two years ago and still remember how good my meal was. The pear salad and the sea bass were amazing!"}
{"text":"Dined on December 4, 2014.

Good service even large groups were present.
The service was super friendly and professional. I had the seared scallop, which was done just right such that the inside was tender. The sea bass was tender and delicious."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by this restaurant.  The service is excellent.  The sale was good, but the pasta was forgettable.  It was greasy and a bit overbooked.  For the price range, not worth a second visit."}
{"text":"This is an exceptional restaurant with consistent quality of service and food. I've been there on many occasions and always had the best service and meals. 

Interior is romantic with dim lighting and original exposed brick wall. There is something very European about it. 

Their wine selection is good - high quality wine list which will certainly please any connoisseur. They carry some unique Italian wines which aren't available through LCBO - I highly recommend them.

Food-wise, everything is 5-stars. My favourite is definitely miso-glazed Chilean Sea Bass, served with toasted Panko, Tuscan kale and butternut squash puree. The fish literally melts in your mouth and the kale/butternut squash combo is fantastic. 

I also recommend their mint and walnut crusted rack of lamb which comes with vegetables and beans. This dish has a distinct mint flavour which in my opinion is the best way to enjoy lamb.

Overall superb food and service - perfect for that special occasion!"}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant for the past five years. Although I don't go often (can't exactly burn my money on luxurious meals) I always can't help but order the same items off the menu! I start off with their beef carpaccio (I could eat this stuff for DAYSSS) then their Bolognese (SO DAMN GOOD I COULD CRY) and then if I'm not completely done for I have a latte with their house made chocolate cake that is full of melted chocolate goodness.  Hands down you cant go wrong with these bad boys. 
I have to prepare myself a week in advance for a meal at Blu. Since I always leave with a food hangover. (In every possibly good way)"}
{"text":"Do we really need another Italian restaurant? Maybe not but I wouldn't mind eating at a good one, and this is one of the better ones. The ambiance is amazing, which is good for dates. Lamb shank and risotto were delicious, probably one of the bests I had in the city. Desserts were so savoury and yummy. We went back once more, and we had halibut and pasta, which were mesmerizing! But the service was too slow on both of our visits. But we can wait for excellent foods"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with 9 of us.
Was great ambience,private area.
The waiter was very attentive,he did not interject during conversations,yet served seamlessly & took the orders.
Explained the specials & made proper & thoughtful recommendations.
Wine list was good.
Not enough salad choices ,but excellent quality & fresh ingredients .
I would definitely be here again for romantic dining."}
{"text":"Just went for Winterlicious dinner with 3 girlfriends. 

The food was good. Calamari a touch salty but still good. Beef cheek main was very tender. Hazelnut cannoli was great (though the mango pur√©e was an odd combo).

When we got our bills we were charged a 20% tip automatically.  I do not appreciate being strong armed into giving an above average tip for a good but not outstanding dining experience.  Our server was nice, but he was sent away or something and these people we haven't seen all night delivered our bills (she didn't even know who had what. I wouldn't be surprised if our server got cheated out of his tip). 

If this is the restaurant's way of squeezing some extra money out of Licious diners, that defeats the purpose of Winterlicious. 

I am NEVER going back here and I will NEVER recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was hoping for some inspiration from Blu, but found none.  

I was pretty excited to check this place out. All of the reviews I have read are very positive. Plus, Massimo is 'famous'. So I think my expectations were a little bit inflated, which has probably tainted the following review to a certain degree. 

The restaurant is in a very nice space and they have done a very good job of decorating. Blu has an atmosphere that can be intimate, comfortable, and hip all at the same time. The warm, rich tones of Blu were very welcoming on a wet and cold Tuesday night. 

The serving staff were welcoming and did a good job of taking care of us and providing suggestions. 

Now the food, was good. But not good enough to justify $50 dollars a head however. The Mediterranean Blu salad is outrageously over priced at $10 (the only appetizer cheaper is the soup at $8). Don't get me wrong the salad is pretty good. But it is just some mixed greens, a nice dressing, and 1 roma tomato sliced on the side. There isn't even any cheese. Now if you were to add thin slices of some really good aged pecorino or parmesan than maybe I would pay $5 for it. 

I had the baked Atlantic salmon ($24) for my main. This is much more reasonable pricing when compared to the $10 salad. Everything on the plate was wonderfully cooked and the flavours were nice. Nothing on my plate was bland. However, overall the dish was boring. It was very run of the mill. I am pretty sure I have made this dish almost exactly at home before (and it was just as good). I could say this about every other dish that our group ordered as well. 

For dessert I had the raspberry sorbet. It was really good, but again very standard. 

So, I would say that if you are looking for the same-old Italian cuisine and you want to go somewhere nice, give Blu a shot. But if like me you think that a meal isn't worth spending more than $50 per person on unless it is something you couldn't do at home (if you are reasonable good in a kitchen) then I would say skip it. There are a lot of other places to try."}
{"text":"You really get what you pay for in a restaurant like this one. 
Really friendly and attentive servers. 
Lovely interior design. Definitely fit for a special celebration or dinner. 
Great food & wine."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a good ambiance, setting and service. I went on a Monday so as to take advantage of their corkage free policy and bring a great bottle of Barolo. Love that corkage free feature which they also told me applies on Sunday as well. For the appetizer i had octopus in a black kale sauce. Very different but good and although the octopus tentacle was pretty thick it was amazingly tender, could cut with a fork. Server told me it was vacuum sealed, placed in waterproof bag and then placed in a machine. Never heard of this but as someone who likes to cook would love to find out more. For the main course had a ravioli stuffed with salmon and a mild cheese (not sure which kind) in a lemon beurre sauce. I was a little disappointed with this dish as it was hard to taste the salmon and overall the dish to me was bland. I think had the salmon been more prominent the dish would have been better. The ravioli itself was very good and obviously home made. I would overall rate this place, based on my meal, as 3 1/2 stars but no such option on yelp."}
{"text":"Wow, I can not possibly recommend Blu Risorante highly enough.

First, the service was unbelievable. My server (also the bar tender) knew quite a bit about wine and pairing. She made fantastic recommendations. 

The food was extremely well seasoned, wine selection was great, and the dessert was amazing. 

The atmosphere was very warm and hospitable.

I must say, every single aspect of this experience was 5 stars in the most conservative meaning of the phrase. If you are looking for a great atmosphere, great food, and simply a great time, then look no further."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect.

Good service.

I had the 5 course tasting menu. Presentation was superb. Everything was seasoned perfectly. Pasta was al dente."}
{"text":"I do like their main courses, the salmon and lamb shank are both delicious, the source for the salmon was too sour for me and I like my salmon without the source. 

I am a bigger fan on the salmon but my partner loves his lamb shank, so I guess the food was good.

Starters, on the other hand, was not that satisfying,  I ordered Roasted Beet Salad with Beet Vinaigrette, Beet Pearls, and Buffalo Mozzarella. I love the mozzarella cheese and I guess I am not a fan for beet...

My partner liked his soup....as always...

Tiramisu was delicious, it's not too sweet, and this is hard; desserts in Canada, they always seem to be too sweet for me.

My partner hated his dessert, he ordered Crisp of the Day and he thinks Tartufo would be a better choice.

The service was nice and the decoration was not bad. The table we had is a bit small. Other than that, this is a good restaurant."}
{"text":"We go to the restaurant on Monday, usually a quiet day.  Once I go into the restaurant, it gives you a high end restaurant feel.  The d√©cor is nice and cozy.  We sit down on one end and as soon as someone sit nearby, a separate soft curtain is lowered.

On Monday & Tuesday, it has a set menu.  I ordered Caprese Salad that is very good even for me that is not a cheese person.  The Cream of Broccoli soup is excellent, not like other restaurants with lots of corn starch. My Veal Medaglione is juicy and the sauce is delicious. The Steak special is tender and the meat quality is very good. Although the dessert Tiramisu Blu is a bit creamy, I still like the taste.  Espresso is very well blew as well.

With the price, the atmosphere and the food quality, highly recommended"}
{"text":"My parents and I came back here we liked it so much. 

The food was all delicious, a great spectrum, no surprises when the food came, and the service was spectacular. The owner talked to us one night he's very lovely, for a Yorkville restaurant its wonderfully intimate. 

I'd recommend this place to anyone for a nice night out or a date."}
{"text":"I've been to Blu about six or seven times now. I keep telling myself to try other places because Toronto has so many restaurants, but I occasionally get lured back. I love the consistency, it's always good. I've had duck, chicken, pasta, lamb, and veal dishes. I've also tried a variety of their apps including the mussels, salads, scallops, beef carpaccio, and tartare (tuna?). Each time I go, I leave satisfied. Price wise, I would actually say it's quite reasonable, I wouldn't consider it expensive for the food and experience. There were a couple of times I felt the server could have improved on their attitude, but most times, the server was amazing. I did bring a cake for my friend's birthday once and it cost us each about $7 for bringing cake in. I felt that I should have been informed of that beforehand, and since there were six of us, the cake basically costed me an additional $42. Just a tip for those who want to bring anything in. Overall a very good restaurant for all sorts of occasions. I usually went for dinner with a group of friends but it would be an equally good place for a date."}
{"text":"typical overpriced \"image\" restaurant with tiny portions (unless you get starchy fattening pasta). Good enough for pretentious groups of women who dig these kinds of places to \"be seen\", but not for someone looking to eat.   You will leave the place hungry and got to go somewhere to get some real dinner. 
Got the lamb dish for $42 or something.  4 tiny chops, with no side vegetables. The scallops appetizer was like $20 dollars for 2 pieces of scallops.  
The main purpose of this kind of place is to separate your from your wallet."}
{"text":"Went back to this location and almost had the same menu with the exception of the Salomi starter and pasta side.

I found the Salomi starter okay but preferred the carpaccio starter I had on my first review.  I ordered the steak once again but found it was cooked past medium rare despite turning away an incorrect order if medium (my suspicion was that the server may have served me the same medium steak I initially turned away when informed him I had asked for medium rare.  Also found a bit of a gristle on the edge which my knife had a bit of trouble cutting through (I was surprised at that??)   Either way the steak was definitely not the medium rare that I had asked although the flavors were still excellent.

I had the tiramisu again for dessert and it was just as awesome as the first time around.

Overall another fantastic meal but lost  perfect marks from the steak.

Still a restaurant I'd recommend."}
{"text":"The seafood fettuccine was delicious. Fresh, good portion size. Was there for a friends birthday party last night, great setting, there was live music (that was actually good), nice ambiance. Great service, would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, since my sister picked it for her birthday tonight. This is my first review of a restaurant. I don't usually waste my time sharing bad experiences, but wanted to give a heads up to anyone thinking about dining at this establishment. So here's a quick summary regarding the Food and Service.

Food: Very nice presentation, flavorful, I thought the portions were decent, but terrible texture. Seafood overcooked and rubbery, lamb(medium rare) tough on the outside but raw in the center..not consistent or even at all, same with the duck breasts. Its decent food, but not a good value at all considering the price range. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere, or better yet cook at home with better results. 

Service: Inconsistent. It's too bad because most of the servers were amazing, but few others are just downright rude, moody and inattentive. The few bad apples ruin the entire experience, they know who they are and should be ashamed of causing the rest of the dedicated and hard working team to lose some of their tips. 

Verdict: Come for the \"atmosphere\" and location if you really want to, but smart consumers should know that the food and inconsistent service is subpar at this price range..actually the service is subpar at any price range, had better experiences at AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time with my company project launch party. The hors d'oeuvres were great! 

I went again with my friends. The services were great. There was live music.   Great atmosphere. Yet, the food were surprisingly just ok.  Decent but I would expected a little more.

My friend ordered a seafood pasta. It was ok.  My hubby ordered miso-glazed sea bass.  Apparently it wasn't as good as we expected. We have been places that offer better taste with lower prices.  

I ordered the special of the day, which was 10oz ribeye. It was good. However, it was a thin slice of ribeye.  It didnt look like 10oz to me. 

Anyway, I think they can do better than \"just ok\" with that price range."}
{"text":"Decor is very nice, waitstaff was friendly.  The appetizers (antipastos) were excellent however the mains were not as good as anticipated.   I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and ambiance. Ordered the truffle beef carpaccio, beef tenderloin, lobster fettuccine, stuffed chicken. Everything came out to be excellent food and service. The only reason why I am giving it a 4 and not a 5 is because the stuffed chickens sauce was quite overpowering after a while."}
{"text":"This place is definitely trendy with a walk up entrance off Yorkville,  and an aww inspired setting when you walk in.   The bar is beautifully set up and is pretty big for a restaurant.   I was sad to see only one beer on tap for a bar that's about 30 feet long.   The bottled beer selection is also limited.   The liquor and wine selection is quite adequate though. 

I sat at the bar,  and it's a nice bar,  but the stools are about 2 to 3 inches to short for the bar height.   It makes you feel like you are reach for a shelf when you eat.   I would suggest some taller bar stools.   

The service was not excellent,  and I doubt have thought differently if the servers introduced themselves.    The service was friendly and prompt,  but there is no full time bartender,  or so it appears.   It was a Monday night though,  so they may cross train them.   It made me feel a little neglected though.   

I ordered the Seabass,  which came with a butternut squash puree and greens.   I asked for a healthy option to the kale that had butter,  and I was told that it is premade.   Kale is any easy green to cook,  so I didn't really get why they couldn't poach some for me.   I got the broccoli greens,  which were very good.   It was seasoned with horse radish; I'm going to steal this one.   The butternut was amazing,  and the sea bass was perfect.   I really wish that the portion size was larger though.   I think the Seabass was no more that 100 grams.   

In the end,  I would try here again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere,interior and service is pretty good.Everything was served very quickly. However,
The food for its quality is overpriced.
The fish was partly undercooked and the boar ragu was way too salty,couldn't finish even half of it.
$150 for 2 main dishes ,2 glasses of wine and 1 desert wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"had an amazing time at this restaurant! perfect place for a celebration, very intimate. food is delicious but not amazing, however I recommend the duck breast and we had a crab ravioli special since they were out of lobster linguine. service is impeccable, and was overall a good experience with good food :)"}
{"text":"Would definitely come back again. Lots of flavour in the antipasto. Lamb was great and fettuccine sauce was on point.  Nice atmosphere and good service. Tuna tartare was tasty and calamari is a must."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: A nice quiet atmosphere, close to the only thing I enjoyed

Food: subpar for the price. Lobster appetizer was quite good however the lobster was lacking in flavor. Pear salad with Gorgonzola was ok but way too much cheese. Finally the duck entree was good however I expected a high end place like this to get the crispy duck skin right. It was not cripsyand the fat had not rendered nearly enough. Not impressed all. Certainly not worth the price
Did not stay for dessert

Service: abysmal. Sat at 7pm and didn't take our order until 820. When the manager came, without a complaint from us, he argued about the length of time, was completely unapologetic, and made no effort to make up for it.

Will not be back. Far better places for equal or less cost"}
{"text":"We had date night here and it was a good that we made reservations. It was busy, but what place in yorkville isn't busy on a Friday night? The duck was succulent, flavorful and left us wanting more. They had a ahi tuna tartare on the daily specials menu, and I'm so glad I got it: it was possibly one of the best things I've ever had! The wait staff are very professional and they had a guitarist playing/singing during dinner. The ambience of this place for a date, whether it's the first date or one of many, was just perfect. Definitely will revisit and definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner during winterlicious. The food was alright but not amazing. The service, however, was something that stood out to me. We were there late, there was only one other table. Between our main course and our dessert, we had to wait around 25 minutes. After we were done, we had to wait another 10 minutes for the waiter to come check up on our table. We asked our waiter for the bill, instead of bringing our bill right away, he went around cleaning tables, coffee makers, chatting with other waiters, pretty much anything BUT bringing our bill. We had to ask another waiter to bring the bill which he did eventually. I find it ridiculous that this restaurant automatically includes 18% gratuity, it means that waiters can be as rude as they want and do whatever they want. Will not be going back this place again."}
{"text":"Booked reservations here during TIFF because we assumed it would be definitely sold out that Friday night.  It mustn't have been, at least not at 8:30 through 10pm.  Not even half full?  On an entertaining note, the actress who plays Lacy on Corner Gas was at a table near us...although no bigger celebrities.

Nice, cozy, dark, modern, chic atmosphere with sheer curtains dividing some of the two-seater tables for privacy.  Long and narrow, maybe 20 tables in total.

Free, little slices of some kind of white rosemary bread served with an orange, mild hummus?  Tasted a bit like pizza.

Yummy Caesar salad with the full lettuce leaves, extremely crunchy croutons (which was also a topic of conversation as you had to hold them in your mouth a little while to soften them or experience very loud chewing sounds!  lol), but no bacon (actually positive for me as a recent vegetarian).

Delicious acorn squash with lentils and goat cheese entree.  I was not expecting it to be so good.  Looked like half a carved out coconut but tasted like potato skins.  Was able to eat about 3/4 of it and took the last bit to go.  Just as good for leftovers!!

Apparently the beef tenderloin was excellent (a 9 out of 10).  Didn't come with much for sides...a bit of rapini, roasted red pepper, etc but guess the portion of the steak itself was enough regardless.

$45 bottle of Woodshed sauvignon blanc, Australia - very good.  

Delicious toblerone martini.  

Ok Blu #5 cocktail (like a fruity champagne to me, so good, but in hindsight probably would've preferred a different martini).

Excellent service.  Attentive without being annoying.

Bathrooms downstairs so be careful if you've had a lot to drink.  LOL

Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"A safe choice in Toronto. Highly recommend the seafood. I love the bread here. Great service."}
{"text":"If I had it to do over again, I would've made a meal of the appies. Inventive, fulfilling and delicious. Our main courses fell a bit short. My companion had the beef and found it tough & sinewy. I had the pasta special and found it cold & tough. On the decor/ambience front - I took issue with the abundance of plastic moulded faux brick that is everywhere and makes the place feel like a theme park more than a historic Victorian house."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic Winterlicious dining experience at Blu that made our visit a night to remember. The Italian decor was gorgeous with all the rich colours which made arriving inviting and alluring. The bar looked beatiful. The seating design in the restaurant along with the stone walls made for a pleasant din that all but covered up the music provided by a solo guitarist at the back end of the room. The seating included some cozy tables for two along the side walls with sheer curtains for some privacy. A comfortable layout design. The service was perfect with our every need (and then some) well taken care of. Each dish gave me the feeling that it was made for me personally. The lamb shank I had was outstanding, tender and delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went to Blu for my mother's birthday on a recommedation from a friend of mine. I'm glad I took the advice. The atmosphere and decor is fantastic. The service from hostess to server was outstanding. We went on a Saturday night and there was live music acoustic guitar and a wonderful singer. 

We had appetizers, entrees and drinks and all were perfect. The drinks are priced at what you expect from Yorkville but the food was very affordable and well worth the price. 

I haven't been but on Mondays they have no corkage fee which is a great deal."}
{"text":"I could have given this restaurant five stars... The atmosphere was fancy but also small and cozy. The live piano player was also great. The food was incredible. I had the beef carpaccio to start. Anytime I visit a restaurant that serves carpaccio I try it. I've tried many, and this one held it's own for sure. For my main I had the wild boar and mushroom gnocchi. This was the second time I've had wild boar and it was just as amazing as the first time. BUT, my stars are downed to four because our server was not great. After ordering the cheapest bottle of wine for the evening, he went on to jokingly call us out on being cheap. Saying \"if you order the cheapest starters and mains I'll kill you ha ha\". Which was... strange. I mean hey we all laughed about it. I'm a student, he's not wrong. But it was just awkward and he probably shouldn't have done it. And of course, like with most fancy restaurants, his attentiveness to us got lower once he had decided \"we were cheap\". This isn't new to me though, so I don't take it out on my ratings."}
{"text":"This review is one month after my dinner at Blu Ristorante in April 2015. My husband overheard me talking about how much I enjoyed my meal and asked if I had reviewed Blu? So here it is, I had the steak and was asked by the attentive waiter, How would I like it done? I replied, Medium. When it came I dug in and after a couple of bites I realized it was really pink on the inside BUT it was delicious and I could not stop eating. The steak was perfect! 
I had the Creme Brulee for dessert and it melted in my mouth. The whole meal, the ambiance, just the right amount of busy without too much noise which meant that we could hear our dinner partners speak. I loved my meal and a month later I'm still thinking about how great it was!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite restaurants in yorkville on Mondays...mainly because they have byow free corkage fee Mondays! The atmosphere is super intimate, service is excellent, and food is delicious. Huge fan of their beef carpaccio which I always get when I dine here."}
{"text":"Only giving it 3 stars because my fianc√© proposed to me on Valentine's Day here. The atmosphere was great. The live pianist was amazing. My fianc√© requested our song when he did the surprise proposal. That was the best part. But this place is crazy expensive. $245 for a 3 course meal? Hell no! The food was eh. The salad with dates was good but the main dinner deal was salty. I got the steak and the potato thing was salty. The dessert was plain. 

The restaurant is very romantic. But the place is so small. You are so close to the person next to you. The waitress was kinda rude. After my fianc√© proposed he came over and was like \"are you guys getting married\" \"to him?\" As if I'm making a mistake. 

Plus 18% tip on top of a $90 meal per person? Funny!"}
{"text":"Blu Ristorante is a consistently great restaurant. I've sampled a majority of the dishes and haven't had one bad experience. It's located in Yorkville but doesn't have the price tag associated with the area. Dishes are fairly priced and the cost of wine & alcohol is comparable to any other nice restaurant. On Monday's they have a 'bring your own wine' night and wave the corkage fee. 

Another reason this place is great is the live music they offer every Wednesday through Saturday. On one occasion I celebrated a friend's birthday here and the piano player sang happy birthday and took numerous song requests. 

The atmosphere, the food, the service - all great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. The restaurant is really nice, it's a lot bigger than it looks from the outside. And the best part was the prices were reasonable! On Thursday and Fridays they have a pianist performer named John Campbell come in and play some fantastic tunes, I would go back just for the music!

I ordered the smoked salmon penne and it was delicious! The portion looked small, but I was so stuffed by the end! The waiters were attentive with the water, and did a decent job servicing our large party. The pianist also played a happy birthday tune for our birthday girl! 

All in all, a really good dinner choice for a special evening!"}
{"text":"I had my birthday celebration at Blu this year and it was a wonderful evening. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was great! We were sitting in a nook within the restaurant that was cozy, intimate and charming. My friends and I were able to hear each other speak and had a lovely evening. They had a live band playing, which wasn't overpowering. I highly recommend an evening at Blu. The servers were great and gave us just the right amount of attention. They didn't try to rush us out. After dinner we enjoyed each other's company, the live music, dessert and some yummy beverages. 

I would definitely recommend Blu for a romantic evening out or a nice evening out with a group of friends. I went with a party of 8 and we were accommodated wonderfully!"}
{"text":"The service is excellent and the food is good, but not impressive. I had the pear salad and the osso buco. I tried a bite of the sweet potato gnocchi from some else plate and it was really delicious. The wine list for glasses is okay, but it has limited options.

Because of the price, fancy decor and location, i was expecting the food to be a bit more impressive. If you have a fancy guest that you want to impress, i would recommend this place. If you just want tasty food, Cafe Nervosa (on the same street) is a better option."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant! Its a bit of a hidden gem being on the less popular side of Yorkville, however that may change now that the Four Seasons is across the street. The food selection was terrific and the meal itself was very tasty with nice sized portions. It is a more expensive place, so not really for everyday. It's warm and cozy inside, even though its rather large. I was surprised to see how popular it was for a Monday evening, so it must be packed on the weekends! Great bar at the front of the restaurant where we grabbed a drink while we were waiting for the rest of our group. I also noticed a great private dining room ( there was a party going on)."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a Friend's birthday, they are very accommodating for special events from hidden rose to special request for the pianist which made everything very memorable. We all had seafood pastas and thought everything tasted good but it was everything from service and special accommodations that made it perfect for events  and for us. Great, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I celebrated my two year anniversary here. I ordered the beef carpaccio, braise octopus, beef tenderloin and aglio eolio linguine. I have to say, all the dishes taste very well. The beef carpaccio had a lot of flavour, and it was not too salty. The Braised octopus was very tender and the tasteful. I highly recommend these two dish as they are very well prepared.
The beef tenderloin with caramelized honey glazed vegatables. It was very unique. The aglio e olio linguine was good and it had alot of ingredients (squid, octopus, scallop, clams, shrimps) 

The atmosphere was very calm and warm. It was very relax, making it a good place for a date. 
Our service Ben was very attentive, he kept checking on us to make sure everything was good. He also gave us some recommendations because it was our visit.

The bill was 100$ per person, but i felt it was worht it as we were both full, and the food tasted good. 

I really enjoyed this restuarant, and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"On a weekend vacation with several travel companions, the concierge at our hotel arranged for the six of us to eat at this restaurant on a Friday night. They had our reservation but didn't have a table setting ready when we arrived on time. Not a big deal, we had a nice table in the center of the restaurant. Far enough away from the piano player that we could have a nice conversation. The musician was great but I could tell tables next to him were having trouble conversing.

The meals were great. No one had a bad word to say... but let's get that out of the way.

The service, on the other hand, was mixed. I realize that modifying an item, with special requests, is a delicate issue. But the waiter's reaction was almost a conniption fit. Seriously. He didn't know what to right down... yes, he had to write it down.

Honestly, I wouldn't have written this review until the last experience of the evening. Traveling internationally, we weren't going to pay for each other's meals. It comes with the fact that we're just a group of friends. In Canada, that translated into a credit card device being passed around the table after the waiter said, \"Guys, this is ridiculous\" (or something equally offensive) when we wanted to split the bill equally.

It was offensive and beyond belief."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant becuase of the good words from many of my friends, but was a bit dissappointed. 
Ordered the scallop with braised pork belly for appertizer, scallop was honestly the best ive ever had, but the pork was too dry. 
Ordered nova scotia lobster pasta and grilled salmon for main, both came in lack of temperature, taste for both were nothing special, just your normal fuccucinine with cream sauce,lobster wasnt that fresh, salmon's texture was ok and the tomato soup base was a bit sour and too overwhelming.
Ordered tiramisu for dessert, didnt taste good at all, very soggy. 
Im giving it a 3 star because the price was fair, $120 including tax and gratuity for one of the fanciest restaurants in toronto, not bad."}
{"text":"Held a birthday party for 7 for Saturday night dinner. Everyone gave the double thumbs up for every appetizer, main and dessert ordered and that included 2 tweens who are picky eaters! Service was 5 stars plus and they even accommodated an on the spot request to add an extra guest that I forgot to include in my original reservation. Prices are commensurate for the area with the Four Seasons hotel across the street. My guests said that they would definitely return in the future. I heartily endorse Blu."}
{"text":"Would only give this restaurant 1 star because of the most awful service at an upscale restaurant. And they automatically charge you 18% for the service. For what may I ask? So that the waiter can go chat on the phone while your food is getting cold? Or so that you wait for the bill for half an hour? The food is good, but it also is at several other restaurants in Yorkville that let YOU decide how much you pay for service ... And I DO like to reflect my satisfaction wit the meal by the tip. Really really disappointed !"}
{"text":"Went during Winterlicious. We had the beats and the beef appetizers. They were very nicely presented and tasty. The chicken and salmon main dishes we ordered were pretty good too. Desserts were normal, but still decent. Over all it's very good experience for a 35 dollar prix fix menu. Great service as well. The server was very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Good date place. Took my girlfriend here for her bday. The waiter was kind and arrange a deser/cake and helped store my gift at the place before we arrived. The food was great but I cant say that it was exceptional."}
{"text":"Blu is a classy, somewhat swanky place.  Very appropriate for a business dinner, such as the one I attended.  I can see it being a great date night spot, as well.  The lighting is low, the color palette rich and luxurious, with a little urban vibe throw in for good measure.  Not too quite, not too loud.  The worst part about Blu is not being able to decide what to order.

The table started with a carchuterie plate, which went around pretty quickly but was right-sized for the table of 8.  Lots of bread and butter was consumed.  I wanna say the butter had some kind of unique flavor.  I would have preferred regular, good old fashioned butter but this is just a minor detail!  Lots of cocktails and wine were consumed before our plates came out.

Most people ordered something different.  I don't exactly recall (after a few drinks) what I ordered but I remember it being delicious!  Everyone was very happy with their selections.  The service was particularly good, keeping our drinks full and having the little bit of extra charm that waiters seems to have at nice restaurants.  The prices were $20-35 per person excluding drinks.  The overall experience was not mind-blowing but pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"I came here for a special occasion and I must say I was very impressed with the food, service, and atmosphere. 

We went on a Monday night and brought our own wine (no corkage fee on Sundays and Mondays). Our server immediately asked if we would like a wine cooler stand by our table. She regularly checked up on us and poured us wine when needed. Our dishes were tasty and dessert was well plated (I had asked the kitchen to write a special message). Service here is no question one of the best in town. We had such a wonderful evening.

I highly recommend this restaurant in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. Food was out of this world! I had the lamb which was delicious! The server was great too. The only downside to the experience was that the restaurant didn't give a complimentary dessert for birthdays."}
{"text":"Lovely staff, ambiance, music and excellent food. Since moving here from MTL a few months ago, this is the first place I've been to that reminds me of fine dinning in Quebec. Will def be back."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner the other night, and I'd say that it was good, but not spectacular.

In terms of service, I was actually very happy, and I think that's a good deal of what you pay for. The waiter was polite, and moreover was actually friendly, or so appeared (all that you can ask for). 

In terms of food, no complaints, we ate light, but everything was served in all timely manner, and as far as taste, pretty good. 

Atmosphere was nice, had a high end feel, as o be expected. The restaurant was about half full.

The reason that I'll give for a 4/5, and I would infer from others is that for what you're paying, combined with their reputation, you'd expect a little something special. You might say they're missing a little of the bang for my buck. 

A good place to impress a client, but not really just for itself."}
{"text":"I went for dinner. Had a very good arugula salad.

My meal came the special it was pasta with stuffed cheese and clams, capers and lobster. 

The meal was served luke warm, the cheese was still cold in the middle of the pasta. I could only eat  half. My guess is my meal sat under heat lamp and only half was covered. 

The other meal was the sword fish it was under cooked. Had to go back to be cooked more. 

They tried to make it up to us with free desert which was a nice gesture. My father order the cannoli  it was not fresh. 

Not a good meal and it was expensive. The special was $35.00. Total was more than $200 with a tip. 



The meal was over $200 with a tip."}
{"text":"Beautiful, quaint, and intimate Italian restaurant located in Yorkville. Stopped by here with friends visiting who were attracted by it's decor and their love of Italian cuisine.  The food and presentation were great, and the fact that most restaurants in Toronto were running the \"Summerlicious\" promotion that offered an affordable prix fix three course meal was the icing on the cake. Waiter service was delightful and overall it was an excellent positive experience. Definitely will come here again in the future when friends are visiting."}
{"text":"Great food, the lobster linguine and halibut fillet were delicious, we also had the chocolate cake dessert..all in all a good meal for a not that expensive price tag. 


I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I had the most pleasant evening here with my girlfriend. I was celebrating an anniversary that was very special to me & the setting was perfect.

The service is not only the best I have received in Toronto, but possibly the best I have received in any restaurant I have dined in. It made the slightly higher prices seem more than worthwhile.

I ordered the rack of lamb, which was truly delicious, I would recommend it to anyone. The waiter was polite throughout & attentive to all of our needs. Needless to say my girlfriend was praised for her choice of restaurant, and we will be back.

Thanks!"}
{"text":"One of our faves. Great for a sexy night out with your date or to celebrate a special occasion. It's a very classy, beautiful
And cozy restaurant. With amazing live music on weekends. The food is spectacular! And The drinks are yummy !"}
{"text":"Fancy pants restaurant in fancy pants Yorkville.

The gnocchi is as good as the old guy in the hat playing the piano in the back. Classy stuff, for sure.

A drunk woman approached my girlfriend in the bathroom and told my girlfriend that some random guy drives a Lexus, \"which is basically a Toyota.\" My girlfriend didn't care, as we took the bus there, being students and all.

All in all, a great experience.

4/5"}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary dinner while in Toronto on a Saturday night and loved it. The atmosphere is dimly lit and very romantic. We sat near the back so we were able to see the acoustic performance. The artist they had that night was Amazing.. My girlfriend order the Chilean sea bass and I ordered the Lobster and shrimp pasta,  the food was delightful and the service was top notch. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"What does one do for a milestone birthday party? You rent a huge party bus and bring all your guest to one of the best restaurants in the city. 

Blu did not disappoint. From the preparation, right the to the food, service and entertainment they get 5 stars not only from me, but from every one of my guests. 

Tania and Jonathan were a dream to work with. Nothing was too much trouble. It was a nice change to be organizing an event with people who understand the client's need for making everything perfect. 

The menus were personalized, the seating arrangements were accommodated, the table settings - elegant, the piano player/singer - superb, the 3 course meal - outstanding!

The servers were professional, personable, friendly and almost felt like part of our friendly crowd. With a party our size (we were 37) there were dietary requirements that needed accommodating. No guest was made to feel like they were annoying or too much trouble. Everything was done with a smile.

I got to know one of the servers, Brian, well. Brian was amazing, as was the other wait staff. He kept track of me as I moved from table to table and served my courses at my different locations, which had to be challenging. We talked and laughed and at the end, we had a huge hug, I really felt like he was a friend. Brian even arranged for me to sit with the piano player while he played me a birthday song. He made me feel special and that's what a top fine dining restaurant is all about.
One of my guests spilled a bit of beet juice from her salad on her blouse. The other waiter seemed so concerned and helped her with tips to remove the stain using salt and club soda. He stood over her and instructed her what to do until the stain came out. Who does that? When have you ever seen anything that attentive in a restaurant? No words for how incredible the entire staff at Blu are.

I've saved the best for last - the food. Every single dish in every course was exquisitely presented. The steaks were succulent and done to perfection, the salmon flavorful and some of my guests commented it was the best they'd ever eaten. The beet salad, kale salad, soup, and calamari were artistically colourful and each bite an adventure in flavours. The vegetarian options were also bursting with wonderful spices and seasonings for an exotic flavor.

Among my guests we had a few wine snobs. The white and red wines chosen by Blu to serve my guests had kudos from even those discerning connoisseurs. 

I couldn't have asked for a better birthday. Blu Ristorante is now my #1. I recommend it very highly for an intimate evening out, or for a big party. These people know how to make you feel special. Two days later, my guests are still talking about the impressive and awesome experience. My husband and I, as the hosts, were very proud that we were able to give each of our family and friends this magnificent experience. It was worth every cent."}
{"text":"Took my Lady here for a romantic dinner to celebrate her birthday.
Love the place. Decoration is a mix between fancy and traditional Italian. Great.
Weekends, they also have live slow music, which added a nice ambiance to the night.
Service was amazing. I asked them on my reservation request to add a candle and a Happy Birthday note to the cake we are going to order as dessert, and they didnt forget or miss that... 
Food: Shared a Calamari starter, tastes good. Their complimentary bread is fresh and tasty. 
I had the Lobster & Shrimp Pasta - delicious - I think I tasted a bit of peanut butter in there...
My date had the Salmon - it is perfectly cooked, but I have tasted better salmon - from seasoning point of view.
Desserts: Chocolate Cake - Rich and Yummy. Tiramisu  - was ok, not great.
Wine selection is good, we had a bottle of Valpolicella Classico Ripasso... Tasted dry, but not bitter, actually with small infusion of fruity. 

Overall, Dining experience was great and elevated the occasion."}
{"text":"Went here for my girlfriend's mom for her birthday. Service was excellent. I had the boar taurine as an appetizer which was amazing and the lobster linguine as my main, which was just ok. They have an excellent selection of wines and they server was great at providing recommendations. Overall the experience was great but there are better Italian restaurants in Toronto I'd recommend over this one."}
{"text":"went there for new years eve with my significant other, there was a pre fix meal 4 meals, overall it was great, the dessert wasn't my fav but still we both really enjoyed it. 

there was a guy playing piano and singing modern songs with his own touch and it was amazing! i think that gave a great atmosphere, the decor of the restaurant its romantic and sophisticated.

great service."}
{"text":"I will probably bring the wrath of the owner by writing this review. Can't believe I forgot to review this but I'm doing it now as a fair warning to those who decide to dine here. My story is, I came here for a Licious dinner with some friends. I'm a food blogger and wrote a review of my experience and noted down what I liked and disliked about the restaurant. Some food was too salty, dessert was lacklustre but service was nice and really accommodating. Decor was very romantic. 

However, the owner then commented on my post with an unbelievable rudeness questioning my qualifications like I was trying to be a food critic. Asking how many Italian restaurants have I been to, what is my educational background to make these critics and such. I'm a foodie but I have never once claimed to have professional experience and education on it. All I can do is review based on my personal preferences and thoughts, like ANY other food blogger or reviewer on sites such as Yelp.   

It was such an incredibly rude reaction to what is essentially a customer complaint, which he could have handled much differently. A simple, \"It's unfortunate to hear that, I hope you give us another chance\" would have been a sufficient answer. I even know someone who worked there in the kitchen and said the owner is very rude and abrasive. Now, I will never recommend this restaurant to any of my friends and have essentially blacklisted it from my blog too."}
{"text":"I was here last night! Great food...beautiful atmosphere...fabulous service! This is what I call a true restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! Great ambiance, attentive waitstaff and delicious food. The classical guitar player during dinner was amazing. Good prices as well. I will be back here often :-)"}
{"text":"Great service. Nice piano player here on weekend evenings. It's not too loud. Light lobster pasta and amazing lamb chops"}
{"text":"We came here for a work party and it was wonderful. They have very private rooms/areas for this function and the service was amazing. The ambience was inviting and classy but not 'trying too hard' to be expensive.

Their cheese and bread platters were some of the best I've ever had. All the food and desserts were also great. 

A++ I know it's expensive but you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice:live music, beautiful decor and great ambiance. The food on the other hand was horrible. I ordered the lamb shank (special of the day) and my friend order the seafood pasta. The food was served literally within 5-7 minutes of ordering and it was served lukewarm. We couldn't even finish 1/4 of our meal, it was horrible! The server was really nice, he acknowledged the fact that we didn't eat our meals and offered us free desert, however it didn't make up for the disappointment we felt with the food. I would never go back to this place, and definitely do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Just dined here a year later and I'm bumping my review from 3 to 4 stars. We really enjoyed the meal! The carpaccio starter was phenomenal--one of the best I've ever had. Salmon was very delicious as well. Also they have a crooner/pianist at the back on weekends. Recommended."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Blu on March 22, 2017 for my birthday and we had one of the worst fine dining experience from both the food and the service.

I ordered a seafood pasta for my main dish and all I could taste was garlic. there was so much garlic in the sauce that if I was eating my pasta without any seafood it would taste exactly the same, garlic pasta! Apart from how unpleasant that experience was, half way through I almost chocked on my food from the garlic burning my throat and my chest. I started drinking a lot of water and I couldn't breath properly for 10 min. When the server came by, she couldn't care less and all she said was \"oh why didn't you say anything when I passed by earlier\", and she asked if I want  something else, which I couldn't but clearly she didn't get the gravity of the situation because she didn't care enough to ask any questions. before this incidence happened, I had tried a bite of my boyfriend's veal dish and the red wine reduction was so bad that all you could taste from his dish was vinegar!! That's when I realized it wasn't just a one off, the food is just SO BAD!

So after a few min I asked for the manager and the manager had even worse attitude than the server. Not only did she not apologize once, she accused me of not liking my food and she argued with me saying that they never had a complain on that dish!!! that's not what anyone should experience in a fine dining restaurant. Then I told her there is no way we will be paying for my boyfriend's food because our entire night was ruined and he couldn't finish his meal because he was worried about how I was feeling. She gave me the dirtiest look, walked away came back and said \"I left the appetizers on your bill because you enjoyed the appetizers, right?\" Needless to say that I was disgusted by the attitude and by the very low class service. We went to Blu with high hopes given some of the really good reviews and now we are wondering what exactly people like about that place! We will never go there again and we will be sure to tell everyone we know not to ever go there!"}
{"text":"This spot is amazing with great ambiance, outstanding service and top notch quality Gourmet Italian Cuisine. We were there on Friday evenning celebrating a birthday and needless to say this place made for a memorable experience. Soft piano in the background, drinks, conversations that could be easily heard. I had the Nova Scotia Lobster Fettuccine, since I'm born and raised Scotian. It was Divine to say the least. If I had to say anything at all, it's that the lobster wasn't as fresh as I'm used to. The Lobster itself wasn't as flavorful and it didn't leave the taste of the sea in my mouth. However overall the dish was very satisfying. An evenning well spent and I will definitely be going back to this place. Thanks for an awesome night out."}
{"text":"Never judge a book by it's cover. What promised to be a good rich experience turned out to be yet another Toronto restaurant disappointment. 
When looking at the menu I thought the food was going to be special. The prices promised to be an experience worth telling your friends and family and business acquaintances. Disappointment of the week. (I dine out a lot). 
Alas the food was weak. Sounded special on the menu. Tastes like your aunt had the right idea but is no chef. 
Pricey. Not worth it at all. 
Service was good."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, we had Mike with the nice eyes as our server. The Beef carpaccio and lobster linguini were amazing, pasta was cooked to just a tad el Dante which how it should be. Perfect place for a date night."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5

I really love the ambiance here; it is modern, cozy and there is something sexy about it.

Here is what we ate:
- Veal scallopini with sweet potato gnochi: The flavors were good but it was just too rich, I could taste the butter and an unpleasant way. (3/5)
- Smoked salmon penne: Salmon was dead on delicious but pasta need some more zing (3.5)

I would definitely give this place another chance or maybe grab a drink."}
{"text":"Was tended to constantly. Mushroom Risotto was just right. Not too creamy. Great place for a weekend dinner. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday for winterlicious. I ordered Tenderloin Carpaccio, Lamb Shank and Hazelnut Semmifreddo Cannoli.

The Carpaccio with truffle oil is definitely a joy, the tender texture can simply make you forget it's beef, the silky feeling with the mysterious and rich taste evoked my sweetest imagination.

The Lamb Shank is also tender, well cooked.The rutabaga puree and gremolata going with it reduce the greasy feeling and the smell of mutton, which I don't really like.

For desert, I had  Hazelnut Semmifreddo Cannoli. It was ok, however, it's not a good choice if you want to maintain your table manners. The only way was to pick it up with your hand and eat it. It was more difficult with some chocolate and sugar powder.

To be honest, the most impressive part came first. Other than that, it was kinf=d of ordinary. 

The service was nice and friendly, I love it. The tip was included in the bill, but definitely worth it. It made me feel that I was taken good care of."}
{"text":"I came for winterlicious with my bf on February 4th. I ordered off the winterlicious menu and my bf ordered off the regular menu. We also had a gift certificate for $50 so the bill in the end wasn't bad at all. 

I got the beef tenderloin carpaccio with truffle oil, fresh greens, fried capers, shaved parmesan which was AMAZING. You could really taste the beef was good quality and the flavours blended so well together. Loved the fried capers. My bf got the pan seared scallop with poached pear, slow roasted pork belly, salsa verde, toasted almonds. Wasn't a fan of the poached pear but everything else was so good. 

Main courses were Red Wine Braised Lamb Shank, Citrus-Rosemary Gremolata, Rutabaga Puree, Carmelized Brussel Sprouts, Lamb Jus (winterlicious) and the pasta of the day which was pappardelle with braised beef I think. Both were delicious and very filling but the pasta is definitely better at Terroni's. 

For dessert we both had cannolis but mine had a hazelnut filling which I loooved and his had regular filling. 

Everything tasted delicious and the portions were good. The service was attentive - the waiter came around every once in a while to refill our water and ask if everything was alright. Prices are definitely reasonable and I would love to come back again. Good for date nights!"}
{"text":"What an amount of mixed emotions on this restaurant. My hotel was just 2 blocks away and I asked for a good Italian dinner. Two people pointed me to this place. It is kind of hidden but you will spot it really fast because of the big signs outside. As soon as you enter, you smell the classy atmosphere and the nice decor. The bar is impeccable and the bartender very attentive too. Why the mix emotions? The place was almost empty. Just a couple on the other side of the bar, 2 tables already having desert and me, and it was around 8PM on a very mild Tuesday evening. Anyway, let's go for the food and drinks. I already had hors d'oeuvres at the hotel, so I just went directly for a drink and a small plate of pasta. Guys, let me be honest, the gnocchi's were unreal... amazingly unreal. Only thing I will have to say, if you are hungry just take another plate before or after, as the portions are kind of small (well, small for an eater like me at least). I do not have much more to say, as I did not spend more time there, but definitively, when I'm coming to Toronto, I will stop at this place again... but.. damn... so many good italian restaurants in Toronto..."}
{"text":"3.5 star. Overall a nice and intimate restaurant with romantic vibes. 

Came here for New Years Eve dinner. For seatings after 8 pm, it was $125 not including drinks, tax or tips so kind of pricey. It's in Yorkville though so that's almost expected. We decided to go to this restaurant because of the live pianist and singing. When we first arrived, there was a pianist playing and it definitely set the mood but he only played about 15 minutes? Then the music stopped... and didn't come back on until 10 minutes before we left the restaurant so it wasn't continuous entertainment. We left an hour before midnight. We booked a late dinner hoping to do the countdown there but it wasn't the right atmosphere. We decided to go elsewhere for countdown. 

Here's the NYE menu and our ratings. 

Starter:
Prosciutto, Soppressata, Beef Salami, Pickles, Olives, Crostini - delicious!

Bella Vittano, Blue Fume, Brie De Meaux, Spiced Nuts, Chutney, Crostini - also delicious! Loved the sour cherry chutney. 

Antipasti:
Truffled Beef Carpaccio, Parmagiano, Crispy Capers, Crostini - this was a very large plate and the beef was well seasoned. 

Red Wine Braised Octopus, Black Kale Pesto, Wild Fungi, Cherry Tomato - this dish was okay. The texture of the octopus wasn't great. It had a canned tuna like texture which was weird

Mains:
AAA Angus Beef Tenderloin, Roasted Truffled Gratin, Honey Cippolini, Heirloom Carrots, Madeira Jus - this was delicious! We ordered the beef medium rare and it was cooked to perfection and oh so tender. 

Seared Chilean Sea Bass, Tuscan Style Black Kale, Miso Glaze, Butternut Squash Puree - the fish was cooked perfectly and the butternut squash puree was done really well and highlighted the dish

Dessert:
Chocolate Torte, Mango Panna Cotta, Fresh Berries with Mint - the torte was slightly too sweet but the mango panna cotta was perfect. 

Overall:
I don't think the price is quite worth it. With drinks it was more like $150 pp before tax and tips. Also no consistent entertainment and service was just okay. Some servers were more friendly than others. Food is pretty good though. Would be a good date spot."}
{"text":"This review is more so a 3.5/5. 

First of all, the service here is absolutely spectacular. Everyone was so nice and the servers consistently came to the table to assist us with pouring water and wine. 

What we ordered: 
APPETIZERS: Ahi Tuna Tartar, Grilled Calamari 
MAINS: Sage & Prosciutto Veal Saltimbocca,  2 Herb Crusted Rack of Lamb 
DESSERTS: Panna Cotta al Limone, Blu Chocolate Cake 

The appetizers and desserts were all very delightful and delectable. Full of flavours and honestly, no complaints about them. I would recommend these dishes. 

However, the main courses were so disappointing. The sauces on all of our mains tasted like this type of sauce you would use in Chinese Stir-Fry... not the most fitting sauce for these dishes I feel. They were both really salty. The rack of lambs had mostly fat on it and felt like we got ripped off or something."}
{"text":"Perfect date spot.  The food was incredible and the service was excellent without being overbearing.  They read the tables very well between the servers and we were never without water or wine in our glasses.  Food was timed perfectly, and the staff / kitchen coordination was seemingly effortless.  

Our server Brian was very funny, knowledgeable with the wine menu and helped us pick a delicious bottle of Amarone.  It went perfectly with everything.  The atmosphere is perfect, not too loud, and the piano player (we went on a Saturday) was incredibly talented.  I believe his name is John - very interesting arrangements of both pop and oldies.  

The food was incredible - we had: 

BREAD and olive oil - Amazing quality olive oil with just a hint of chili.  It was delicious. 

APPETIZER: Parmigianno Reggiano cheese, Prosciutto, Sopressata, House Cured Pancetta - the star was definitely the house cured pancetta although you cant go wrong with any options involving meat or cheese :)  Obviously this went quite nicely with the wine. 

STARTERS:  Beef Carpaccio with Truffle was fantastic.  We also shared the Pork Belly / Porchetta appetizer which was cooked to perfection.  The slaw on the side was really nicely done with a hint of sweetness and apple.   Seasonings on point.

MAIN: We got the tenderloin with truffled potato gratin, heirloom carrots and braised cippolini onions.  We asked the kitchen to slice it for us so that it would be easier to share.  Cooked perfect medium rare and tender. I think it was served with a demi-glace which was delicious as well. 

DESSERT: Gelato trio.  The strawberry was particularly phenomenal, loaded with real strawberries but not too sweat or overpoweringly creamy - very fruit forward. The chocolate and vanilla were  amazing as well. 

Overall the experience was just as good as the food. Can't say enough positive things about how well-run the front & back of house coordination is.  Also a very romantic spot with the background music, would recommend for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and nice service.  Came here after Christmas dinner for special reason. My husband and I wanted to share main dishes. The server brought our food separately done. Very nice and we were happy. Love original cocktail and tiramisu."}
{"text":"Coming in with a bigger group, we ended up ordering and sharing quite a few appetizers. Every one of them was amazing! Also my main which was a lam meatball type of entree. I like that the restaurant wasn't too busy even on a Friday night. Also, beautiful decor at this place."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious ($45) 
Loved the place, the service was really polite. 

Food was great but not as taste bud stimulating. I don't think their Winterlicious menu gave them justice. 

We were instant fans of the calamari. The salmon easily flaked off and the beef was tender, both were made perfectly. The desserts really hit it off for us, the hazelnut cannoli and the lemon pana cotta are definitely worth the try. 

They also had a live pianist which we thought was really neat. I think our dining experience would be a lot more different if we sat more deeper into the restaurant. The draft from the doors and the seating beside the bar really didn't do it for me. It felt more like a casual restaurant with fancy service. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Although we've had some great meals in the restaurant part, I love coming to the bar at Blu.  It's one of my favourites in Toronto.  Very comfortable.  Great bartenders.  Good wine list.  Wonderful food.  And the service is some of the best in town.  Don't come here for a bargain; I don't want to be sitting beside you.  But come for a quality experience."}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's day with le bf as a surprise dinner so had no idea what to expect. 

The entrance to the restaurant was quite hidden in my opinion, didn't really know I was there until I was at the door. The setting and atmosphere was quite dim, probably considering it was Valentine's day so all they had were candles for light. It was, however, quite romantic and relaxing, although a bit too dim. We booked our table online so there was no waiting needed. It was however packed that night! Parking was also hard to find, regardless if it was Vday or not. 

And because it was Valentine's day, the menu was set, which means we couldn't try their 'normal' menu. The staff was courteous and welcoming though, so service was good; can't complain there. 

Food was beautifully presented, but to be honest flavours were not as great as I had hoped for when entering this restaurant. It wasn't blah but wasn't wow either. 

I would visit this place again to try their \"normal\" menu, but if nothing really strikes out then there are many more places like this out there."}
{"text":"I have to say, for a fine dining restaurant it exceeds my expectations in terms of food, service, attentiveness and quality of taste. 
Although it's abit dark for my liking, if you're looking for a quiet and romantic dinner then this is a nice place to be. There's the wild mushroom truffle risotto which was absolutely delicious, and the lobster prawn pasta ... Which I find the taste slightly in the bland side. But the desert panna cotta was bigger portion served than expected. Served well in taste as a way to end a tasty meal."}
{"text":"I had my wife's birthday dinner here and it was definitely a great experience. From the beginning when we contacted this restaurant a month in advance to reserve seats and get information, they were professional and courteous to the end. I contacted the owner on the phone and spoke to him throughout. This place just made us feel so accommodating.

My wife was given a chance to look over the different party menus they had and she was given the time to change it around to her preferences. I was surprised to see a place so accommodating. The price was fixed and it was a 3-course meal. For large gatherings we found this so helpful. We know what our friends like and what they want and with this place being so helpful we got to provide everything right to our friends. 

It just so happened that 3 of our friends were running behind and had us waiting for them for about an hour after the reservation time...in which time the owner still had an extra table available for us reserved even though the restaurant was packed and had people waiting for seats. I finally told the owner to take the table as I didn't care for people showing up so late. But that I won't go into. 

All in all, the food was exceptional and the portions were great. The desserts were loved by every single person in our party. They were absolutely delicious. This place did not ask us to put down a down payment or even a minimum that we had to spend or buy bottles, like other places I contacted. This is what I loved most about this place. We needed a great menu, a beautiful restaurant, great staff, no bottle service...and that is exactly what this place offered. GREAT JOB!!"}
{"text":"Went there for a bday and it was nice. Spent two bills for two people. Not sure if it's worth that much but it was nice to try. The food was pretty great and the service was relaxing and mellow."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious in February 2014.  Food was great.  Service very attentive.  Location fabulous.  Drinks very pricy but I guess given the location  in Yorkville not entirely unexpected.  Had the soup, chicken and poached pear.  All great choices.  Would highly recommend for a date as the ambience is very nice.   Not sure I could afford here during the rest of the year though."}
{"text":"Service was really great. We had selected a bottle of red but it wasn't great so they allowed us to choose another selection without any fuss. We had the grilled calamari and the pear arugula salad - both were pretty good. We had the beef cheek and the mushroom risotto and both were also pretty good. Desserts were excellent - tiramisu and a coconut lime canolli - both were very fresh. We paired this with a cappuccino and and espresso. I think the best thing about Blu is the lounge like atmosphere and the live music. We really enjoyed our time dinning here. We easily spend 3 hours talking eating and listening to the live music. We would go back to try something different on the menu next time."}
{"text":"Came for Winterlicious and made reservations for 6. Walked in and was seated immediately, the restaurant was full. It seems like an older mature crowd. The waiter was delightful and tried to be funny.

The presentation of the food was impeccable but the taste just didn't live up to how it looked. Everything tastes average and nothing stood out after the entire meal. The kitchen missed an appetizer and the server offered a latte on the house. Had the beef carpaccio, should have came with more bread because eating the beef alone was a little too salty. Ordered the braised beef cheek as the main. First time having beef cheek and it was tender, felt like the meat really did melt. The dessert tasted like most tiramisu found anywhere.

The most amazing thing about the night was the live entertainment. There was someone playing the piano near the back of the restaurant. Overall, won't be coming back for a second time."}
{"text":"3 visits in 2 weeks with guests. Yes, you will want to be here too.

Opentable reservations prompt and courteous.
Live smooth jazz guitar and awesome vocals coming from the piano man.

I'll sum up the three visits:
Uno
Special included a (me) squid ink pasta with based octopus paperdelli and a chipono. The pasta was fantastic with a black, leather look and buttery taste. Outstanding.
Risotto of the day with sausage but not offered in 1/2. Only full orders as entries. Sad this is not an option
Her:  wrapped Veal scaloppini that rocked. 
Beat salad with buffalo materella and homemade beat pearls with a beat vinaigrette was devoured by me. Who makes their own beet pears? Blu does and they rock.

Due
Steamed mussels in white wine. Pow!
Had to try the Ossobuco. HUGE! Nice flavor and big enough to share

Tre
Crab cakes (balls) rolled off the tongue good. 
Grilled Tiger Shrimp, heck yeah.

Margaux and Tanya were excellent servers with recommendations based on our likes and dislikes. They really know the menu. I was never disappointed at Blu and will return. While on business in Toronto, I send two other parties over and all had rave reviews. 

Blu, you're doing it right. Don't go changing."}
