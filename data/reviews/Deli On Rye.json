{"text":"Although I initially went into Deli on Rye all ready for a half pastrami on rye and a half cup of matzo ball soup, I really enjoyed the owners reccomendation of the corned beef and cabbage soup. In fact, as she told me, they've taken the Matzo Ball Soup off the menu, \"We just couldn't always get it right, so we'd rather not sell it.\" I can respect that. Anyway, I do have to say, that the half pastrani on rye and half cup of corned beef and cabbage soup was a great cure for a cold, snowy, northeast OH day. Plus the price was great."}
{"text":"I did not like this place. Since its a deli one would think they specialize in delicious sandwiches. Wrong! I ordered a French dip sandwich, if was boring and dry. I ordered onion rings and hated them they were huge thick onion rings that were fried in old oil that tasted like fish. The place looked beat up and a little dirty(duct tape on the seat cushions). The only thing I did like was the pickles. I probably won't ever go back when I can get a daves cosmic sub down the street for half the price and enjoy every bite!"}

{"text":"This deli has had two different owners in the last three years without any significant improvement in quality.  This is not the kind of Jewish deli you might be used to in NYC, Chicago, or Cleveland.  There is little \"fixings\" for sale for take-out and the cold case can sometimes suffer from significant shortages of drinks.  On the other hand, they have had Hoegarten beer, not something you find in many delis.  Their specialty is sandwiches, mostly named in some idiosyncratic way, for nearby towns.  The pastrami is quite good and the egg salad, when fresh, is also good.  They are one of the few places locally franchised by Vienna Red Hots to sell \"Chicago style\" hot dogs but unfortunately the owners have never been to Chicago or read the instruction manual (I grew up in Chicago).  On the other hand, there is plenty of nearby parking (it's in the shopping mall on SR 303 west of the center of Hudson) and they are rarely crowded."}
{"text":"I grew up in Hudson and have always liked this place.  The prices aren't amazing, but I really like their sandwiches with the chopped liver.  The fresh pickles are pretty good too.  I haven't been there in over a year, so I don't know much about the different managements."}
{"text":"My friends and I were just commenting on how the food and service seems to have gone downhill since the new owners.  I have had a few takeout orders end up being wrong, but no big deal.  This last time I ordered a TWO ingredient sandwich and got home to open up a ONE ingredient sandwich (it's tough to keep track of that many ingredients?).  On the phone, they offered to give me a new sandwich AND a refund if I came back to get it.  When I got there the manager said that offer shouldn't have been made, and I was NOT going to get both like I was offered because it would cost her too much money.  They've lost my business forever, which will cost more in the long run, so I don't understand the mentality."}
{"text":"Very regular diner. Bagel with cream cheese was good. The waitress was sweet, but a little intrusive."}
