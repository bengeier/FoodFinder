{"text":"Great food, great service, nice environment. I will recommend it To anyone who enjoy who loves good home mexican food"}
{"text":"Some co-workers of mine are absolutely ga-ga over this place.  After three visits, I can't understand why.  The food is decent but not the best.  My gripe is that there's only one cook, even during the lunch rush.  That means a very long wait for your food.  I am allowed a one hour lunch break but I don't like wasting 55 minutes of it waiting for my food.  That means having to drive like a southern Californian to get back to work on time, even if work is just down the road.  I have noticed the name change, but I'm not sure if their way of doing things has changed."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant , good food excellent service , stunning view . Great for party's . Just call them and they will set for your needs ."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast burrito that had ham and bacon eggs and cheese!! It's the best breakfast burrito I've had so far. I'll definitely go back and get some salsa for my burrito!"}
{"text":"This place no longer exists, DO NOT buy the deal they have advertised on here as the restaurant will not honor it because they have changed names...rude staff, management suddenly did not speak english when I was having issue with the fact that I purchased a voucher through yelp and they would not honor it....10 minutes later."}
{"text":"Had the chimichanga with some chicken nachos. It was bland and had no flavor. Guacamole was runny. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while waiting for my car windows to be tinted.  I'm not the biggest Mexican food fan, and wasn't expecting much.  But to my surprise, the food was delicious.  I had the fajita combo with rice and beans.  It all had better flavor than any big name Mexican restaurant I had ever been to.  Even the tortilla chips, which came hot out of the fryer."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I really dig this place.  Great food and service.  This place is what Roberto 's wants to be. Chimichangas and tamales are awesome."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite! Went there for my first time.. And then the next night.. And the next night! So good! And the salsa is amazing! So is the service."}
{"text":"First impression of the restaurant and staff is awesomestaff is very friendly and the food is awesome in the restaurant we're cleaning as I give them a tent we ordered several items on the menu and we wanted to try we have some favorites couldn't choose just one"}
{"text":"We may have found our new quick Mexican food place. I personally like this place far better than Roberto's.   The menu comes they basic Mexican food groups and the portions are larger than I expected.   Hubby had the shredded beef chimichanga and I had the carne asada nachos. We both ordered ours with some changes (no cheese inside the chimichanga and sour cream and avocado sauce on the side for his and mine).   We visited the salsa bar while waiting for our food and we ended up trying all of the salsas. I also loaded up on limes and jalapenos.   Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. And it was delicious. We ended up sharing my nachos and we still didn't finish all of them.   We're definitely coming back to try other stuff on the menu...can't wait!"}
{"text":"I've been there 2 times, each time using the yelp discount. The first time was okay. The hubby and I order chimichangas and wings for the kids. The second time was better. I ordered the carne asada burrito, the hubby got the chimichanga again and this time instead of wings, fingers the kids. Overall the food is good and fresh. I would go back again."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious here ! Definitely has the taste of authentic Mexican food! Small place and doesn't look too special but don't let that fool you. You will not regret coming here!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.  Everything I've had here has been on point. Carne asada fries and chorizo and egg burrito were great. Very clean place very friendly people! Check them out soon!"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, clean restaurant, tasty food. I had beef tacos dorados and cheese enchilada plate. Tacos were super crunchy and light and the enchiladas were bomb! I liked the beans, but wasn't a fan of the rice. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is next to our daughter's Cheer gym, so we decided to try it. We had the carne asada fries & carne asada chimichanga. Both were pretty good. They were cooked fresh to order. The nachos had cheese sauce, although good, would have preferred real cheese. The meat was great! Burrito was tasty, would have like a little more sauce topped. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I'll tell u what, the food here is no where near authentic Mexican food, the food here has no flavor, microwave taste ect. Not to mention we had 3 different plates to share & I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"the food here is amazing!! way better than anything I've had in quite a while.   I had the carne asada nachos...I think I bit my finger and tongue lol    my food looked exactly like the menu picture"}
{"text":"Starting with the good. The cashier/server was nice. The menu didn't mention my chicken burrito would have rice in it. I told the cashier, because I hate rice, and he apologized promptly and offered to remake it, which he did, really fast.  The restaurant was clean, as far as I could see. I felt comfortable eating there and the menu provided variety, which I love. Also, the prices were decent for the amount of food we received.  Now to the not so good things. I ordered the chicken nachos and they were not good at all. The chicken was room temperature (it was a chilly room), the cheese was too loose, the sour cream was runny and the chips were too thick for my taste.  I ordered the chicken burrito and it was a nice size but I didn't like the fact that the majority of the filling was beans. I didn't have a lot of chicken at all. I do have to admit, I liked it better than anything else I tried though.  I ordered a Mini Monster Shrimp Taco also. Although I didn't eat it, it looked awesome. My friend ate it and she enjoyed it. She said that it was better than the other items she tried.  Now, because we were very hungry when we arrived, we also purchased chips and salsa as we waited for our food. We were not aware, nor did the cashier tell us, chips and salsa came included with both the taco and the burrito we ordered. Consequently, we ended up with three servings of chips.  Spending 2 dollars on extra chips would not have been the end of the world, if I had something to pair the chips with. The salsas were terrible, to say the least. They were sitting across the room in a little self serve area and they looked horrible. They were all just runny and dingy looking.  Nevertheless, I tasted all three they had to offer. Two of them were very hot and disgusting. I dipped one chip and almost passed out. The taste was horrible and the flavor was worse. I was reluctant to taste the last one so my friend did. She liked it, so I tried it, and it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't delicious either.  To sum up my experience, I would say I didn't like the place and I won't be going back to be tortured."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I am a fan! The service is on point and the food is yummy. My first time in I did the two cheese enchilada combo and a carnitas street taco. While the rice and beans had virtually no flavor, the enchiladas were tasty. The highlight was definitely the carnitas street taco. I had been thinking about that carnitas over the weekend, so I returned for lunch yesterday. I had the carnitas burrito which was really tasty! I am looking forward to giving the rest of the menu a try! :)"}
{"text":"While the service was good my wife and I thought the food was cold and bland. Would not return."}
{"text":"I come here at least once whenever I'm in town.  Great service.  Great food....well I just order the carne asada burrito every time and its great so I assume the rest of the dishes are just as good.  I ask for less rice, add lettuce and more veggies.  Haven't been to Chipotle since I discovered this place."}
{"text":"Super clean... Good food and very good price...they have a covered patio if you want to sit outside.."}
{"text":"This place is now  El Nopal Mexican Grill. I had the Burrito with Carne Asada.  Turned out to be a bean and rice burrito with a little meat. The GF had the chicken fajitas  and they were smothered in tomato sauce.  Picture and the discripiton did not say anything about tomato sauce.Green sauce on the salsa bar and guacamole have way to much cilantro in them. You don't taste anything else. Over all the meal was not very good. I think we will stick with Saborr down the street."}
