{"text":"We came here for a birthday dinner of 9 people. The food came out more than an hour after we ordered. The food actually taste good but not worth the wait. There are another 5 people in the restaurant and did not order that much."}
{"text":"Beaucoup trop cher!?                                     Je n'est jamais vu un restaurent qui fait des sushis aussi petit, le menu devrait avoir des photos... pour le prix des sushis? Des unagi à 3$ uni c'est cher et en plus le petit morceau d'anguille toi. J'ai connu mieux côté fraîcheur et prix, 42$ pour 24 morceaux??"}
{"text":"Saiken Sushi is a little bit off the beaten path for me, but something brought me twice for dinner there. The restaurant is just next to metro station and bus stops, easy to access with a car and very easy to park around even during the weekend. The salon is relatively small, well decorated and feels comfy, without being pretentious.   The first visit was on Friday night and the place was packed. Food came kind of slowly and our hostess who takes care alone of everyone managed to be attentive to all the customers. Next visit was on Wednesday, we were the only customers in the restaurant and the food was served a little bit faster.   The sushi rolls prepared by the chefs are original and quite delicious. I think Blue Haven and Lichee Magic are my favourite ones. Sashimi is OK and I'm mostly impressed with the salmon toro. What is absolutely must try in Saiken Sushi in my view are the Nepalese dumplings called momo. We ordered twice the pork version, just amazing, so delicate and flaverfull, accompanied by a spicy sauce that adds additional level of piquancy to the dumplings. Kirin Ichiban in big bottles was the perfect drink to go along with all this food.    Overall nice addition to the sushi restaurants in Montreal with original food ideas that will make you return."}
