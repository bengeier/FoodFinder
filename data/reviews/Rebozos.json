{"text":"I wanted to love this place...I really did. A few blocks from home and all the great reviews? Sounded awesome.   I've been twice. First time was about a year ago...walked in craving Mexican and decided on a burrito (takeout menu is limited ). First off, the takeout area is separate from the dining room and appears to also be the kitchen. A huge amount of pre cooked food in Tupperware and a microwave should have been my first clue but I persevered based on all the good ratings. I asked the staff (owner?) for a suggestion and he said the pork was best so I went with it. About $9 with tax. Got it home and unwrapped it (alongside a cold Corona, of course) and was utterly disappointed. Bland, flavour less rice despite asking for it spicy with a few shreds of (now soggy) lettuce and barely discernable pork. I added my own pepper sauce and sour cream and tried to make the best of it...until about 1/3 through when I bit into a big chunk of cartilage. Eww!!! It's bad enough there was almost no meat and what there WAS it cartilage? Ugh.   Forward a year, more good reviews so I tried again. I went in and wanted to order takeout again...the one staff on hand told me it would be a long wait as there was a medical emergency in the dining room (!) and an ambulance was en route. Hopefully not the restaurant's fault, but I won't be back in any case :("}
{"text":"I am from Mexico City and I have lived in Toronto since 1981. This is the first time I have had Pozole in Canada and it was wonderful. This is certainly one of the best Mexican offerings in Toronto.   But... I found that the location was unimpressive from the inside. The prices are also very very high for a simple taqueria and they don't sell alcohol. But the food was great.  I would return."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Rebozo today after seeing the restaurant win a taco competition on the television show Taco Wars. We were quite disappointed with our meal. We started off with guacamole which were cold like it was pre-made and stored in the fridge. I prefer my guacamole to be room temperature. The chips were a store bought variety.  Then my husband ordered the enchiladas verde, and I had the tacos. He said his meal was lukewarm and could tell that the rice and beans had been microwaved. I had the tacos (3 per order) chicken, pork and beef tongue. The beef tongue tacos were the feature of the television show, but my order came without pico de gallo and Queso Fresco. My tacos were literally just onions and meat (since I don't really care for cilantro). We both felt that in a city with so much taco choice we wouldn't go back.   If you're looking for an authentic Mexican food in a similar neighbourhood we would recommend King Taco on St. Clair West."}
{"text":"In any other city, Rebozos would be getting four stars, and would be a good Mexican joint.  In Toronto, it is the only place to get tacos prepared correctly (and simply!)  The service is out of this world friendly and the environment is relaxed.  Worth the hike to the somewhat off the beaten path location."}
{"text":"I went for the beef tongue tacos after the many great reviews. Unfortunately when I arrived they were no longer available on the menu. Instead, I tried the cochinita, pollo and carnita tacos.  They were pretty good, but nothing special.  Equal to many others in toronto.  The homemade hot sauces were delicious and the corn tortillas were also very good. Was hoping for a little more flavour kick in the meat but it was well cooked and moist. I still want to head over to the college st location and try the beef tongue."}
{"text":"We tried their shrimp taco and vegetarian taco from their food truck at Evergreen Brick Works yesterday. Both the tacos were amazing. Freshly made with fresh ingredients and were absolutely delicious.   The shrimp taco had shrimps in chipotle sauce, garnished with onions and cilantro; topped with some chipotle mayo.  The vegetarian taco had black beans, mexican rice, onion, cilantro and fresh cheese on the top.  Do watch out for them in the next food truck festival. We surely will."}
{"text":"Real mexican food, in the middle of nowhere. I started going here about a year ago and it was exceptional. Fresh, good ingredients. Simple taste and Harritos tamarind, my favourite. The quality and taste seemed to have slipped a little lately so I'm looking for the next great authentic mexican place... but still way better than most."}
{"text":"finally, great to find a decent taqueria in Toronto!...the beef tongue tacos were my faves, and the chile relleno was also really good...the big screen TV playing crazy Mexican music videos was also a plus in my books...will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with Rebozos.  Maybe it was what I ordered.  Our recent Mexican UYE had a great turnout, and of course, I had to veer from the normal and get something other than tacos.  Lauren loved her pozole, and Vivek loved his tacos (heee).  I was not loving my chicken mole dish.  The refried beans were very soupy, the Mexican rice was just okay, and the chicken pieces were far and few between.  The guac was okay, but you could tell it wasn't super fresh as it had been refrigerated.  The chips were not homemade either.  The decor is homey and makes you feel like you are in someone's home.  When I went to go pay (they accept debit - no VISA), I noticed it was just one gentleman in the kitchen and his wife(?) was serving.  Very cute.  I think my fantastic Mexican crusade for Toronto still continues.  Mexico Lindo on Bayview (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mexico-lindo-toronto#hrid:hobG0S6V24DcLtfVgJVI5w/src:self) continues to be my favourite with their homemade chips and fresh guac.  Would I give Rebozos another try?  Yes, for the tacos or pozole....and more Spanish soap opera watching!!!  They do have parking onsite, or if you are taking the Dufferin bus north, get off at Rogers and walk 3 blocks west."}
{"text":"This is authentic. The food made here is as Mexican as a Canadian restaurant can get to Mexican food. Most of the client√®le is Mexican, and I was brought here by my Mexican friend who had been looking for a Mexican restaurant for ages.  Some of the dishes here, like the Birria I had, you will not find in many other so-called 'Mexican' places who are more likely to sell you a fajita instead, which is not Mexican food but TexMex.   Now, why does it get three stars? Well sometimes restaurants get points for where they are located, unfortunately Rebozos is located in the middle of nowhere. It is hard to imagine that a non-local would make the trek here unless they have a car and even then, it is still a bit of a non-trip since it might take you twice as long to get to Rebozos then it will take you to eat here.   Secondly, the place, like a lot of authentic Mexican places does not really look like a restaurant but rather a house that was converted into one, and not very well done. It is a bit cold, the tables look ancient or low end and the colour scheme is... \"meh.\"  However if you cherish the divey look of a place, then you are welcome, you might love this joint, however keep in mind it is low-rent, not kitsch.     Thirdly and this has always been an issue that it is not really Rebozos fault but it is this: Authentic Mexican food is pleb food -- just like most authentic cuisines, except for perhaps French fine dinning.   Mexican food is generally meant to be made cheaply and sometimes with not many ingredients. For example, there is no such thing as Authentic Mexican fine dinning. Now, does this make it bad or with little taste? Nope, not at all.   You see, I do not think an Authentic Mexican --or other world cuisines, can survive selling 100% authentic food without overpricing even if the ingredients are inexpensive as dirt. Otherwise they will not be able to pay wages/rent if they sell at what the food is actually worth due to Canada's standard of living in and on top of that... recipes might be altered in order to fit Canadian tastes.   Since Mexican food is cheap to make, you always walk out thinking you have somehow been ripped off a bit. Is this Rebozos fault? Nope.       Having said all of that, even though it might be tasty, my point is that Rebozos is a bit overpriced for what you get. Plus if you add the \"middle of nowhere' factor then in my humble opinion, this locale looses a star.   However I am interested in checking their new College Street location, which although it has a more condensed menu, it is far more convenient for most people without cars and in a nicer neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We just moved to a house that's a hop skip and a jump away from Rebozos. This may become a problem for me.  The food here is delicious and the service is very friendly. It's not the best Mexican food I've ever had, and the prices are a tiny bit higher than some other places, but it's still very good.   The guacamole appetizer is excellent, you run out of chips before you run out of guacamole. The carnitas tacos are delicious, fatty pieces of pork shoulder and the enchilada verdes meal is also very tasty.  The place is very casual and homey, it's a nice spot for a relaxed lunch or dinner."}

{"text":"Rebozos is a taqueria that serves tacos for around $2.50 each.  They have other things available like enchiladas and pozole, but I only ever seem to get the tacos.   They have the best tacos in Toronto right now. Unfortunately Rebozos' tacos are not as good as what you can find in places like Chicago, San Francisco or LA, let alone Mexico.   It's a small place (although it's bigger now).  The location is not central so it doesn't get too busy.   I have had the lengua, cabeza, chorizo and carnitas tacos.  They were all good, although I prefer a bit more crispiness in my carnitas.  Hot sauce, onion and cilantro are optional."}
{"text":"Bad bad food!  Torta carnitas and tacos are expensive, salad, little portion. They don't have idea how is the Mexican food with good portions!  The only good thing is the pozole."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious Mexican food! The real stuff! I love the carnitas tacos and tortas. The choriqueso is good as well as their pozole. Really recommended. Their food truck has the same quality!"}
{"text":"Went here back in February and have been meaning to write a review because I've been fuming about how bad the burrito was ever since. It was the worst burrito I have ever had in my life. It was so tasteless and awful I had to throw it out and I never waste food. It was veggie so I can't personally vouch for the meat but my friend who was with me had meat and said it was equally disgusting. she also couldn't finish hers. Bland, bland, bland. What a waste of money"}
{"text":"I was very excited finally i found real mexican food because I tried the tacos from the food truck in the cabbadge town fest and they were super good. Today I came to the restaurant with my friends, we got enchiladas, beef torta and huarache. So disapointing, the huarache was build with two tortillas, what is that? They supposed to make it fresh with masa. Why would you serve tacos? Enchiladas were served with rice and beans, you could tell the beans were right out from the can, no flavor whatsoever, the rice was like days old and not flavorfull. Enchiladas made with bottle sauce, I could just have made all this at home. The torta was so plain, even my friend that eats plain food complaint that it was expensive for what he got. Not coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Toronto. Saw it on Taco Wars which ended up winning because of their Lengua tacos so I needed to try it. Came in and ordered just the Lengua. The restaurant is super small and when you walk in, the first thing you'll see is the kitchen which is pretty tiny. Anyways, ordered the lengua tacos which came out in a group of 3 with corn tortillas. The lengua was fantastic containing onions, cilantro, the tongue. Added a squirt of lime and some spicy sauce and it was delicious. Also tried the chicken, beef and pork tacos as well but those were nothing compared to the lengua. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The place has character.  The area has character.  The service has character.  The food presentation has character.  The food is ok.   Based on what the other yelp reviewers ate, it seems like folks vary differently in their opinion.  I had the pozole and carnita tacos."}
{"text":"Saw this place on the TV show \"CMT Taco Wars\".  It won first place for best taco in Toronto.  Competing with Playa Cabana Hacienda and Milagro.  I had the Lengua tacos (beef tongue).  The tacos was simple, contain onions, cilantro, hot/mild sauce, lime and beef.  The beef tongue was the only thing that was tasteful.  I didn't think it was anything special and don't I understand why it won best tacos.  I guess I was expecting more flavors and creativity.  Food 3/5 Service 3/5 Ambiance 2/5  I would not go back."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Mexican restaurant in the city.  Plain and simple. People please disregard what good things you've heard or seen on TV about this place. Simply horrible and overpriced. I walked away feeling ripped off and still hungry.   Me and my girlfriend both ordered a tortas (Mexican sandwich) each. She had the chicken and I had the pork. Up on the board it said $10 with a description and below it \"your choice of meat.\"  This was the tiniest, most flavourless and stale sandwich I ever had in my life. Then when we got the bill I noticed the chicken tortas was $12 despite the price board saying \"$10...your choice of meat.\" When we had pointed it out to the waitress she shrugged it off and was basically like 'chicken is $12, FU pay me!'  So we paid and left. No tip. It's time we stop rewarding people for poor service and poor food.   People, instead of this place, bring your hard earned money to:  Kings Taco on St. Clair West Al Pastor on Dundas St. West.    You will thank me."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were craving Mexican to celebrate Cinco today, and decided to check out this place, a short 10-15 minute drive from where we live.  Things we loved:  1) The warm decor and it's location in a converted house make you feel like you're in someone's living room  2) The food is legit.  Some dishes were better than others, but it's real authentic Mexican food, hard to come by in Toronto.  3) The service was fast and friendly  4) Portions were generous and prices reasonable.  I wish they had a liquor license, as a margarita or beer would have been nice to chase down my Enchilada Verdes plate, but it wouldn't keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"I think this was actually a house turned into a restaurant. The men's restroom is in the kitchen! Its definitely a family run place. When you walk in and see mostly latin people sitting at the tables its generally a good sign.  I tried a bunch of the tacos. The marinated pork ones are the best. It's not nearly as good as tacos you'll get in Mexico, but then again no place outside of Mexico is (I lived in san diego, and mexican food there is also not even close to the food 20 miles away in TIjuana - I think its those massive cauldrons filled with grease that make the carne asada meat so damn flavorful). If your up for it, you can order the carnitas by the kilo. Service is nice. Overall pretty decent, but the location is a bit out of the way.  Unfortunately, no booze though :("}
{"text":"So admittedly this review may come off as somewhat biased, considering I spent 3 years of my formative youth living off of tacos in Mexico. Although twenty years have passed, I still have that insatiable craving for tacos. The kind you eat at a street vendor, hunkered over a paper plate , buzzed from the beer and panchanga. So let's get to the meat of it. The tacos are amazing! With the \"sabor autentico\" that I've been craving, the carnitas were unctuous, a little greasy and mind blowingly flavourful. The lengua (beef tongue) was meltingly tender and prepared with the kind of loving care of a master. Last and not least by any stretch of the imagination the chicharron en salsa roja. Let me start by saying that if this is not something you have enjoyed before, it can be texturally challenging. Chicharron is fried and rendered pork skin and in this preparation is then stewed in a delicious tomato and chili sauce. The result is a satisfying delight of a taco, unrivaled by few. Slightly chewy, wonderful sauce, and all of the tacos are garnished authentically, chopped cilantro, and minced white onion. After a double order (6 tacos) and a Sidral Mundet, I was near to tears of joy. Thank you Rebozos, thank you for giving me a little taste of my past right here in the big smoke! I'll definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Really great to have this around the corner from my house. I always get take out and almost always get the beef tacos. When you ask for hot, they're not messing around and I eat a ton of hot food."}
{"text":"Tried the place for the first time and it was tasty.  Met my expectations of the place, which wasn't too high. If I lived close by I would drop in again for their tacos."}
{"text":"I'm a pushover for places like this.  It's a hole in the wall with two entrances - one for sit down, the other for takeout.  They sell little a lot of little things (tacos, sopes, etc) for just a couple of dollars apiece, some full dinners in the neighbourhood of  $8-12 apiece and family style feasting sold by the kilogram (carnitas for $45/kg).  I asked the owner one time what he would eat if he could eat just one thing on the menu every day for the rest of his life and without hesitation he responded that if he had carnitas, he wouldn't need anything else.  He's right.  The carnitas come with a few sauces, some condiments and some tortillas.  Me and 6 other people ate here recently and split 1kg as an appetizer.  In reality, the 7 of us should have just gotten 2 kg and been done with it.  Their other stuff is delicious (in particular the tongue tacos and enchiladas in mole sauce) too, but carnitas is really all you need.  The one thing that would be nice is if there were a few more sides to go along with the carnitas.  Chopped cilantro and onions can only take you so far.  A few chopped tomatoes or lettuce would be a nice little addition to the dish.  Also, this place doesn't take Visa or Mastercard, so cash or debit it is."}
{"text":"GO POZOLE - GO POZOLE - GO POZOLE, GO!!!!!!  3.5 stars.  They have pozole here! And it's delicious. It's the first place I've seen it on a menu in Toronto. Pozole is a spicy stew with pulled pork meat simmered with dried maiz (which looks like giant kernels of corn). It comes with some round crispy tortillas, lettuce, veggies, extra spices and dried herbs that you add to the stew and mix in.  The Yelp party of 7 I was with stuck mostly to the tacos here, which looked okay but I'm glad I tried the pozole.  I would go back here if it wasn't located in the middle of nowhere. (Rogers Road, wha?!??!)  Great service and you can watch tele-novelas on the big screen and listen to authentic Mexican tunes. Decor basic but functional.   Que bueno"}
{"text":"I came after hearing great things, but was sadly disappointed. Although the service was great, I found the food to be rather bland. Expected a lot more flavour - I'll be going elsewhere for tacos next time!"}
{"text":"My search for authentic Mexican food continues after my visit to Rebozos.   Rebozos I thought you are the one... the one that satisfy my cravings! Your location at a odd part of town and the residential setting with minimal furnishing does make me thought you were the ONE. But how deceiving is the first expression............  Pulled Pork, Beef Tongue, Chicken ($2.50 each) I tried were flavourless... I have to drown them with your salsa to give them some kick. Sopes ($3.50) was disappointing... Huaraches with beef was dry and chewy. Guacamole was A-OK but not the best I had.   Services were excellent/warm and we all got separate checks.  However, I felt empty and lost after eating your tacos. Really are there any good Taco in Toronto???"}
{"text":"Soooo disappointed  I saw this place featured on Taco Wars Toronto I went in to give it a try the next day.  I was wanting to try the winning dish featured on the show - beef tongue taco  I walk in and was immediately informed by the only staff there that it was her 1st day, she was alone and I would have to wait for the owner..... I asked how long & she did not know \"but soon maybe\"  Any other time I would have left after 5 minutes but the show *really* peeked my curiosity so I waited the 15 mins.   Owner lady comes in, I place my order only to be told there is none made. She says she will order the tongue in a few days I can come back.   I order simple beef tacos - dry as heck & have to just roll my eyes.  The place is not run like an actual business and the owner gives no impression that she even sees running it as an Actual REAL job  Going to try out king taco on st Clair"}
