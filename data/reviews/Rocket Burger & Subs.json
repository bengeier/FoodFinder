{"text":"Visiting from the Pacific Northwest when I came upon this place.  The burgers were great. I first had the Philly burger and decided to come back another day to try the gyro burger. Both were great and I highly recommend getting jalapenos in both to get a zing to the burgers. They make their sauces fresh everyday (i.e. ranch).  The owner was very kind as she even gave me a few cucumbers at no charge for my teething daughter. Yes it just a cucumbers but the shear thoughtfulness that the owner had was top notch customer service in my book.  When I come back to Arizona, will definitely be stopping by here again"}
{"text":"Chili dogs were fantastic. Ruben sandwich equally fantastic. Diversity of soft drinks second to none. Great place with great prices."}
{"text":"If the classic root beers and sodas don't sell you then the burgers will. Lots of choices of burgers but every one of them is great!"}
{"text":"This place was deilcious! I went there today with my boyfriend and we both loved it. He got a bacon cheeseburger \"Rocket Style\" and he let me have some. The burger was cooked perfectly and the toppings were fresh (I especially loved the crispy bacon). I got a cali sandwich but ended up being so full from the bites I stole off my boyfriend's burger that I didn't finish it. Next time I think I will just get my own burger . I say get a burger \"Rocket Style\" and you will never want a normal burger again!

Also make sure you give your self some time to pick what soda you want because there are a ton of choices! I don't think of this as a negative factor (as some reviewers did), I think it makes this burger joint unique!"}
{"text":"Had the chili cheese fries.  Was disappointed.  The cashier didn't know the menu at all.  Husband had a burger. One of the staff members said he would bring us mustard and forgot."}
{"text":"I would give it zero stars if possible. I couldn't even eat my cheeseburger. The meat had no flavor whatsoever. Went with two other people. They said the same. For the amount of money they charge, save yours and go somewhere else. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try Rocket Burger for awhile now, and finally had my chance last night. Before even ordering, I picked out a bottled soda which took longer than the wait for my food. There are so many choices it was hard to decide!

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and fried pickles, which both were so good. The others' in my party ordered the teriyaki burger and a kids chicken tender bites. Both of which they enjoyed. Not to mention all this food, with 3 bottled sodas was only $23. So we got great food, with great service, for a great value. Will be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"First time here after reading the good reviews..I had a Tasteless chili cheese dog, bun was served broken in three pieces and was seemed to be old and stale. The soda machine was broken and cans of soda were offered but not with refills like machine sodas. Overall I was disappointed and will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Grabbed the California burger with some cheese curds! Small hidden place but is awesome."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner tonight. Had the spousal unit and my mother along. Mom had regular burger, wife had the teriyaki burger and I gave the staff a choice between three burgers and they chose the Baja double. Baja was awesome loved the Mexican slaw and the hint of lime. Burger was fresh and cooked perfectly. We then chose fries, onion rings  and cheese curds. Fries were very good cheese curds were so good wife and mom wanted an order to go. 

Huge selection of craft soda as well as craft soda in the fountain nice change from big soda company. Will definitely be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Just gotta say yummy... so good it tickles... dw, my son, got the terriaki Burger... ummmm really??? With a fried pineapple slice.... let's just talk about the housemade terriaki sauce... and not your typical bun either... listen... don't get me wrong... its a Burger joint... BUT it's not 'just' another Burger joint... after all the 'taste is outta this world'... and the fries... exceptional!!! 

On to the cherry... they probably have over 200 different sodas... old school favs and some new school stuff... everything from Virgil's root beer... to the ever natural Oogave drinks... they even have one called dog snot and Kitty pittle (not feeling THAT adventurous today)... creamy deliciousness... 

Whether it's next door to you... or across town... it is DEFINITELY worth the ride..."}
{"text":"Great food. But it is not cheap as advertised by Yelp with one $ sign. Its expensive."}
{"text":"2 weeks ago my bf and I were discussing Sonic and their slushies. That prompted a conversation about  \"Slush Puppie\" drinks that I grew up with back in Tennessee. I loved the lemon/lime ones that they used to sell at the local corner store. That prompted me to Google to see if anyone sold them now and in Phoenix. To my surprise Rocket Burger popped up! We decided to check them out as they also have over 300 sodas for sale some that are hard to find. I let out a child like squeal when we walked it. There it was, glowing like an angel!! SLUSH PUPPIES!!!!! I purchased the biggest size they had and it was as good as I remember as a child. The owner, Steve was very nice and we chatted him and his counter guys up for a bit. We took a look at their menu. WOW is all I can say. So many options. We went for the Double Bacon Cheese burger, fried mushrooms (with cornmeal). Absolutely delicious. The burger was tasty, flavorful and the bun toasted to perfection. The mushrooms were divine! Best outside of Bun Huggers up in Flagstaff. I would highly recommend this place. If you love vintage soda pop, a great burger and Slush Puppies check them out. We ended up ordering them for takeout last Friday night. My bf had the gyro burger and we ordered the french fries. I had the BCB again. Once again a great meal!! Will be returning over, and over again.."}
{"text":"The burgers at this place are amazing! The different combos that are available create a burger that goes above and beyond, like the Reuburger, a combo of delicious burger and a reuben sandwich. The subs are pretty delectable, too. I helped my wife finish off a Philly Cheesesteak that hit the spot. Don't miss the mushrooms...a real treat! And talk about an incredible soda selection!
   I did experience a small issue on a recent visit...a part of my order was left out, and a return to pick it up was required. I contacted one of the owners, Steve, who sets a very high standard for customer service. He went above and beyond to correct the small issue, demonstrating genuine concern for his customers and the quality of the product and care with which it is served. Don't wait to try this little local joint...I can't see how any self-respecting lover of excellent burgers could be disappointed with this gem!"}
{"text":"The food is so good! But you will be very disappointed with the service. The staff seems very cold and are not the most courteous. The atmosphere is run down and very dirty. But despite all this the food  is so good! Meats are tender and fresh and the buns are soft and very fresh. It might be best if you go drunk so that you can taste the food but forget what it's like on the inside"}
{"text":"I'm going to go back.  If only to try a different soda.  Fantastic!  It honestly would be a 4.5 kind of place but I'm rounding up because of how quick the service was and the insane variety of sodas you can choose from.  it's basically the Total Wine of soda places.  I got some Leninade soda and it was delicious!  The wife got a grape soda that made you forget about any other grape soda you've ever had.  The food is great too.  I had the Santa Fe burger and it had a weird sweetness to it that I wasn't expecting (it had to be the pickles!) , and a very nice bun that absorbed everything the burger was throwing at it, and it was a lot (Good house sauce!).  Again, I will go back, and I will get root beer!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and I haven't even had the chance to go inside. My husband has picked up food and yummy sodas from here twice. He said the service was awesome and the owners are super nice. The food is yummy!!!! Best pastrami in town! My boys love the rocket sauce. The cheese curds and onion rings are the best! Best Deal in town."}
{"text":"I never do reviews, but I had to after going to Rocket Burger heaven!  This is my new guilty pleasure.  The burgers are juicy, big and satisfying, their subs are tasty and inventive, and their onion rings are awesome, crunchy greatness.  Their fries are perfectly crisp, and their fried mushrooms are crunchy, fresh and wonderful."}
{"text":"Super cheap, super tasty.  Like everyone says they've got a crazy amount of sodas (try Gale's rootbeer) and a Slushpuppy machine.  Everything I've tried has been good and they're quick."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. I had the double gyro burger.  I thought it was awesome and I was impressed for the second time in a row.  The owner brought out some Mexi Slaw and it had some amazing flavors.  They also have craft sodas on tap now and all of them were very true to taste and not too sweet. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent local burgers.  You HAVE to come see the ridiculously large gourmet soda selection."}
{"text":"If  you buy 5 of their hundreds of bottled sodas,  then you get one free.

The burgers and chicken sandwiches are awesome. I would go more often, but it is very warm in there during the summer.

Buffalo Chicken and the Afterburner are great. Very messy, but good.

Fries are awesome about 3/4 of the time. The other 1/4 of the time they are average.

The place looks like a dive from the outside...not much better inside, but great food and drink.

If you \"sign-in\" through Yelp or Facebook, then they give you 10% off!"}
{"text":"awesome place! took my parents while they were visiting phoenix. great food and even better sodas and prices!"}
{"text":"Best place ever to go eat. They prep everything there, home make all sauces and salad prep and it's absolutely delicious! Their California Club is absolutely delicious and outstanding! Their burgers are to die for! 12/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"For a local hamburger place this is it for me.  They have it all.  Great fries, wonderful burger, and good buns (and yes that's vital!).  Any soda you can think of!  GREAT PLACE!"}
{"text":"Okay, so i went with 4 stars but there are a few caveats.  My first visit was a 5 star experience: i went on a weekday night with a moderate crowd.  The Chicago burger was everything I could ask for in a burger - super juicy and tasty.  My second experience was unfortunately a 3 star experience: I went on a Saturday afternoon with a line to the door.  Now I didnt mind the long line because thats a sign of quality food and my last burger had been amazing so i was happy to wait.  Unfortunately, the staff didn't seem to handle the rush all that well.  The girls at the register were still friendly but things got a little messy out on the floor and in the rush to get the food out to so many people a few things got overlooked.  Most noticeably, my fries came out a bit undercooked and there were some pools of oil in the basket.  I have a family of 5 and all of our fries were way too greasy, also I went with the Chili burger this time and the chili itself tasted canned so the burger lost that freshness.  Still, this is a good spot just avoid the rushes"}
{"text":"This Is a Tasty Burger!!

Found this place on yelp looking for a non-major burger chain. I got the Sante Fe Burger, fry combo. So good! The burger was cooked perfectly with crispy bacon. The fries are amazing and everything came out quickly and hot. Sante Fe has a huge fried green child on it. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"They sell Dublin Dr Pepper. The food was good and reasonably priced, but let's stick to the important facts, they sell Dublin Dr Pepper."}
{"text":"Only disappointment leaving rocket burger is that we dont have room for more! Had the New York burger..again..and it was amazing as usual. Wife had the kraut dog and said it was the best sauerkraut she's had. Baby had a side of avocado that she chowed. Fried mushrooms were on point, and of course the awesome assortment of pop makes this Michigan family happy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My niece loves the rocket sauce on her burger and called it sublime. I had the Afterburner grilled chicken sandwich and it was excellent! All the different flavors were a perfect blend. The rocket relish and horseradish mayo with jalapeños added a nice kick. And you can share an order of fries. Plenty big and some of the best fries I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great burger place for sure! The fries are really good as well. Definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"I am normally not a burger person, but this little place won my heart.

I walked in with a wall of fridges full of variety of unusual sodas greeting me. The menu was simple but covers everything that you would want from a burger joint. 

Service was nice and quick. I ordered Cali Burger and was shocked by how good it was. The burger was juicy and moist, but not fatty or greasy. The bacon was crispy but not overwhelming. Avocado was fresh and green. The bun was toasted just right. 

I wasn't too impressed on the cheese fries, but their onion ring was deeeeeelicious!!!

Can't wait to take some friends to go with me soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Awesome concept, Awesome Burgers, and 5-stars on bringing back slush puppies. Great place."}
{"text":"Omg!!! Amazing food!!! Service was fast and friendly!!! I will definitely be returning in the near future!!!"}
{"text":"2 of us had the New Yorker it was amazing! Fresh bread great slaw packed with tender pastrami. 2 had the Angus cheese burger on home made bun equally as good. 1 had the chicken bites real chicken breast freshly breaded excellent! Try the fresh made onion rings delicious. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good but not great. My wife had a sub and I had a burger. Both were good. I will say the burger became such a mess I would have preferred a frock and knife. 

The fries were good but the cheese curds were awful. I literally has a bunch of curds that had no cheese. Also the cheese curds were overly salty. 

They don't serve name brand drinks but their own brand. It was nifty concept until I realized why the big names exist... they're better tasting. 

All in all they were good. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is rapidly becoming one of our favorites! I usually get the bacon cheeseburger, but decided to go out on a limb and try something different. Had the Mexican burger and was not disappointed. Onion rings and fried zucchini are both great--might be a bit too salty for some, but my family prefers to salt their salt. The topper is the soda pop selection. I'm totally addicted to the butterscotch root beer--currently."}
{"text":"Hard to find good chili fries in Arizona. This place has it down. Hand cut fries with a bean less chili on top, the way it should be. Burger was delicious with a soft bun with crispy edges.  Kudos to the friendly staff for their outstanding service."}
{"text":"The greatest! Every time I take a first bite into their double New York burger, my atheism falls under siege. This is manna from heaven."}
{"text":"Rocket Burger offers a variety of choices that you probably won't find at larger food chains. :P Pretty much everything there is delicious. And,and, AAAAND (Look how excited I am) they have a HUGE selection of bottled sodas. Seriously. There's just a WALL of carbonated, fizzy, goodness~."}
{"text":"Long trip from Las Vegas to Rocket Burger and Subs with the family. The food here makes the trip well worth it. Well, I'm actually here to see family, but we always have to stop at Rocket Burger when we're in town. Wifey and Grandma loves the meatball sub. I normally get the New Yorker, but I think the new fave is the Afterburner. And make sure you make it a double and get an order of onion rings with those delicious fries. Soda selection is boss. Chocolate soda is actually quite delish."}
{"text":"Love this place. A wall of coolers contains every bottled soda and rootbeer known to man. Great burgers, try the New Yorker sub."}
{"text":"I came to Rocket Burger expecting one thing and then got blown away entirely! I came in with my S.O. and we were greeted warmly by the girl behind the counter. She explained everything for us and was super helpful in suggesting the Santa Fe Burger. I loved it! We were able to pick from so many flavors of soda while we waited! Even though it was date night we still enjoyed the casual atmosphere and very low prices! Definitely coming back and recommending it to all our friends!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are awesome, the buns really make the sandwich amazing. Cooks are really cool and care about how everything comes out. The family loves this place and the price is almost the same as fast food and only a million times better"}
{"text":"Some of the best subs I have ever had!! And I travel a lot and will most definitely be coming back for more! Love the selection of soda's they have and being from Hawaii.... They even had some from there also. Loved the place!"}
{"text":"What a find!  The location might leave a bit to be desired, but the burgers definitely do not.  This is a unique restaurant that has amazing burgers, fries, and a wall of bottled sodas. I ordered a double afterburner burger and with the works and it was a lot of food.  The horseradish mayo was awesome!  They have a triple burger (Rocket side) that I cannot imagine trying to take down!

If you prefer to stay away from the chain restaurants and are looking for a great burger, look no further!  I am looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Plain and simple.  Wow.  The Eddie Lopez pastrami burger was pure Awesome and the fries they came with were a delight.  Came in because of the yelp reviews.  Our party of nine was pleased.  I recommend the blueberry Maine root soda and the Gale's rootbeer.  I am glad there is a place like this on the west side.  I am looking forward to my next visit.  Cheers to rocket burgers and subs!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I often bring my guests from out of town and never fails... Everyone loves the food and atmosphere!  My guests often just want to come back for the wide variety od drinks!"}
{"text":"I would give it 4 stars if they would use the Air Conditioner.  With all of the soda combinations and solid burgers what's not to like.  It's hard to enjoy your food when it's so dang hot inside.  I will return when the temps come back down."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and we love this place! Everything we have ordered has just been fantastic and we can't wait to go back again!

The rocket burger? Yum, yum, yum!!! The roast beef with the horseradish mayo on sourdough? Delish!!!!! Fries? Could they be any better?? The large greek salad (add a side of gyro for a $1?). Uh yes, please!!

Top off all that food, with great prices, more kinds of bottled soda than you can shake a stick at (including a Judge Wapner variety!), and super friendly staff --- we will be lifetime addicts!
:-)"}
{"text":"The old adage of \"it's what is on the inside that matters\" is true when it comes to this place! It's located in an older strip mall with a Church's Chicken in the front, not someplace boyfriend and I would stop for on a whim, but other Yelpers had good things to say and they were spot on. It's in a renovated convenience store, so the layout is a bit odd. Also, it was kind of humid when we went, nothing too unbearable though. The food was phenomenal! I got a pulled pork sandwich (which just melts in your mouth) and boyfriend got a New York burger. He said that the pastrami is strange, but in a good way. The soda selection is unreal! Rows and rows with bottle after bottle of quite possibly every type of soda you can imagine. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food awesome prices and a monsterous selection non alcoholic drinks (over 300) I just tried the \"afterburner chicken combo\" about 8 dollars with fries drink and tax included.  Wow that was an amazing sandwhich . . . I live over 40 miles from the shop but eat here as often as I can because of the value and quality of the food!"}
{"text":"Went to Rocket Burger & Subs today after reading so many positive things from Yelp and was not disappointed.  

The food was very good, fresh and Yay...Faygo soda!! The soda selection is awesome and unique.  We got two Faygo's w/ lunch and got two different sodas to try later.  Shoestring fries were very good and hot.  Roast beef sandwich very good as was California Club.  Chicken strips were very good and were real meat; not like the pressed chicken you get at other places.  We plan to come back often and try more menu items and stock up on Faygo.

The owners are also friendly and personable which gives this place an old school, neighborhood establishment kind of vibe.  I think it is important to keep our entrepreneurial spirit alive and love to support local businesses; especially when they show the kind of quality, attention to detail and personality that Rocket Burger and Subs displayed on our visit."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars. But a place with the word \"Burgers\" in it led me to setting high expectations for the burger I ordered. Thank goodness for my big appetite that day because I ordered the regular burger and a chili dog. 

The chili dog was spot on! The burger, cold and not much to it. Maybe I should have sent it back, but I hate being wasteful, so I ate it. But sadly that made me not want to order a burger there again for a long time. I'll give it another chance someday because of high rating."}
{"text":"Like trying new places and going to places like this over a chain restaurant. Love the wall of bottled sodas. I am doing low carb right now and ordered the after burners but with no bun and just asked for some sort of lettuce wrap or just on lettuce. It came out in an awesome chopped salad with the burger on top and it was awesome. Burger with no bun can be pretty simple but this was not at all. Love it."}
{"text":"I have dined twice for their sandwiches, and they are average at best. Haven't sampled their hot dogs or hamburgers yet, maybe that is their strong point. However, they have a HUGE selection of bottled pop.  And they have FAYGO, in glass bottles made with cane sugar.  Excellent!  If you haven't had faygo go and try a bottle."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp happened on this nice friendly burger/sub shop. Great friendly staff putting out high quality food. Best selection of craft soda from all over. We had a really good pastrami sandwich which I am extremely picky about and a green chilli burger with delicious cheese curds and fried pickles definitely coming back here again. You won't be disappointed if you try it. Owner of the business super nice. Thanks Rocket Burger."}
{"text":"I love this place! I like having so many soda options and the food was super yummy ! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A couple of coworkers and I went to Rocket Burger for lunch today based on one of those coworkers' recommendation of the place.

The staff member who took my order was very nice and the food was ready within about five minutes which was nice. And the wall covered in different sodas from all over the place was pretty cool.

While I enjoyed the fries very much due to the seasoning I was only mildly impressed with the burger itself. I got a double bacon cheeseburger which I expected to enjoy and finish. There was something about the sauce though that I couldn't figure out and it ruined my experience.

I hate the fact that something like the flavor of the sauce has anything to do with my rating of the place, but it was something I couldn't get through and I couldn't finish my burger. I tried working through it, too. It just got to a point where o couldn't ignore it any longer and the aftertaste was no different.

Would I visit again? Most likely but I won't be going out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"My wife and I saw that this place had some great reviews on yelp so we decided to try it out.

Yelp was right! Place was excellent! Burgers were great! The staff was very nice and friendly. The guy taking are order had asked if we had been here before and we said no, he then proceeded to go over the menu and answered any questions we had. We ordered and it only took about ten minutes to receive our food. Burgers and fries were delicious! I will definitely be returning to try more things!"}
{"text":"One phrase, SLUSH PUPPY! I've been looking for Slush Puppy in Arizona since I moved here.  Rocket Burger has it!!. Also they feature an modest selection of eclectic bottled sodas; root beer, sarsaparilla, blue etc.  Friendly & fast service, very casual atmosphere and cheap.  Had a basic burger and a bag of chips (sweet Maui onion)  $3.50. The burger was well seasoned, bun was toasted, served with a thousand islandy sauce."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix from Toronto for business conference. Drove about 25 minutes to get this burger based on reviews on Yelp. Got a Double Afterburner and a Single Chilli burger with onion rings. The guy at the counter, who I think is one of the owner's, was VERY nice and polite. If you are a fan of soda, they have a HUGE selection of about 300 different sodas to choose from. I grabbed a 4-pack of Jones Blue Cream Soda for about $7.50 (!).

NASTY!

The onion rings were coated in a VERY thin layer of disgusting batter. it was of a dark brown colour and not very good at all. Both of my burgers (I love food) had soggy buns and were not very good at all. I don't recommend this place at all. I would rather eat at In & Out."}
{"text":"we were here visiting from San Diego and this place popped up on our Google search. After reading the reviews we decided to try it out and we are soo glad we did! this place was absolutely delicious. Definitely recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Wow!! We came here to eat after seeing the reviews. Well we came here from Utah for a concert and we will come back again next time we come down. The burgers are the bomb!! Five different burgers and they were all fantastic !! And the soda pop selection was second to none. Until next time."}
{"text":"Although their prices are a little steep for burgers they are worth it. I got the Philly cheese steak burger and it was to die for.... no for real I think I had a heart attack eating all that grease. but all jokes aside it was everything A burger should be! Can't wait to try some of the other menu items. I just wish they serve their cheese curds with marinara sauce"}
{"text":"There's a reason why this place has 355 near perfect reviews. On our first visit, I had the Santa Fe and my wife had the Cali burger. Both were excellent. We shared a basket of fries that were cut in-house. This is the quintessential hole-in-the-wall spot. If you're in the area, this is a must try."}
{"text":"The serving sizes here were gigantic. The pricing is fair, and the menu is varied. I came with a group of 10 and everyone liked their order. The service wasn't incredibly fast, but it was reasonable. The people there were also really nice, and the soda selection might be the most at any restaurant in the state of Arizona. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I dare you to find a better selection of soda paired with awesome food. Great staff that strives to give you great service and food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Don't let this rough looking little shopping plaza scare you off because inside the shop is some of the tastiest food in this part of town.  The Chili Cheese Fries are a must!  The \"Rocket Burger\" is a steal, imagine 3 burger patties with cheese and all the fixin's on a sub roll for 6 bucks (makes the $6 burger at Carl's Jr. look like child's play).  If you want something spicy ask for the \"Thunder Bird\", a buffalo chicken sub with bacon, ranch or blue cheese, and the optional fresh jalapeños. And if all of that is not enough to make you want to go these guys stock an insane amount of rare sodas that you will not find just any where. I think they had about 12 kinds of root beer! This is defiantly not fine dining so please excuse the rough decor, this is straight up man fuel."}
{"text":"I know many people like this place but I am just telling my experience. 
I was not impressed at all.  We got the Afterburner burger and cali burger, fries and onion rings.   We were the only people in the place and all our food was luke warm or room temprature.  The patties were very thin and thinking I would get pickled jalapenos on my burger they were actually raw. Every burger place I have been has never had raw jalapenos - maybe I should have asked or maybe they shoul post they are raw.  The onion rings batter was not even batter it tasted more like cornmeal and they were room temperature - should be hot.  The buns were hard and not soft at all.  Our first time is our last time there. Sorry but very poor food quality."}
{"text":"The best burgers in this area! The bottled soda selection is like nothing you've seem before. The Santa Fe burger is my favorite"}
{"text":"Simply put, one of the best burger shops in the city.  The meat is fresh, albeit a tad greasy, the cheese and bacon rock, and their crazy twist on 1000 island is awesome!  Only detractor is the grease as it destroys the bread.  But the main event?  The cooler packed with the 350 best soft drinks you never new existed!  Sprecher rootbeer at 1.89 a bottle all day!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here off and on pretty much since the place opened, but took a break of about a year. Recently, however, I'm not sure if I can still think of it as 4-star, because of the inconsistency that appears to have woefully only happened to me based on these reviews.

The last burger I ordered looked and smelled wonderful until I picked it up and so much rocket sauce ran out that I considered hooking up my pool draining equipment to siphon some of it out. Rather overpowering. After scraping some off, I took a bite and holy black pepper! It was like an employee played a prank and unscrewed the top of the pepper shaker and instead of making a new burger thought \"eh, they might like coughing and gasping for breath while army-crawling to the sink for water\". After shoveling off the pepper, I enjoyed the burger. They have great buns and I know great buns, because I do daily squat thrusts.

Well, aside from the fact that half of the burger was medium-rareish (I like) and the other half well-done (nooo!). Not sure how that was managed.

Fries: completely inedible. The oil was obviously not hot enough. The only texture was soggy followed by waves of oil coating my mouth.

I'll keep occasionally going there, but probably never at nights again. The kitchen staff looked rather young. I recall that I used to stop by on school day afternoons, back when I would have easily given this pace 4-stars."}
{"text":"Was searching for a place to eat before a Halloween party. Saw rocket burger on the map and had heard someone mention them a week earlier.
Ordered the \"Eddie Lopez\" double burger, had pastrami on top.
Best damn burger.....not better than mine....but close :-D
Fries suck but i just wont order them again.
Service was good and the owner is there every time i go and is very friendly.
Which is probably the reason for 5 stars, i don't hand them out like candy....
(Edit: Changed to 4 star, gotta keep the 5 stars exclusive)
They have over 200 different sodas in the fridge which is pretty unique.

Ive been back 3 times and will keep going back."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant so much.....I'm from California and Austin Texas and whenever I'm in Phoenix it's a Must that I have to come here to eat. Great food and they have tons of soda's that I never even heard of before and it's hella cool trying those different drinks and the manager is a really nice person and great staff. I found out about this place one time I was in Phoenix with my friends we were looking for a good place to eat and I checked on my iPad for places to eat so I went on yelp and I found Rocket burger and subs and it got a good Rating so I told my friends for us to try it out and we all loved it so much....so if your visiting Phoenix You must come here to eat and taste all the different drinks.....wish they had a location is California and Texas"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Awesome burgers, awesome fries, and the best selection of soda I have ever seen.  Ever I'm ever back on the west side, I will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered a Santa Fe burger it was delicious & the chili cheese fries were ridiculous lol very cute place, it was a little warm in there but other then that it was awesome. Defiantly will be back"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in my old stomping grounds. As a former \"Rocket\" I had to see what they hype was about. Took a drive into my ol' hood. And was shocked how the neighborhood had changed so much in 30 years! Rocket Burger is tucked behind Church's Chicken. It did not disappoint! I have been there twice now. I have tried the rueben sandwhich, California club, California burger, the NYer fries and onion rings. All of it was great and affordable. The subs are packed with meat and the sandwiches are big enough for two people to split. My least favorite was the burger. But for subs I would go back. The onion rings were crunchy, with a light coat of batter, and thinner which I like. The fries were just ok. But then, fries are not my thing. My kids liked that they could pick out any type of soda. I picked one that tasted like a mojito. My daughter had a pear soda, and my youngest had a delicious rootbeer that had butterscotch in it. The coleslaw on the NYer was great! It was fresh and crunchy! In fact all the vegetables were fresh! Even the avocado, it wasnt just a little bit that came on the burger, but it was enough to cover the entire bottom bun. The tomato was wasnt chintzy either, Yay! Great family business that I would support any day over the big guys. This place rocks. And all of us can find something to eat here. Score!"}
{"text":"Have I got a place for you un-health conscious, frugal foodies out there!  Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices, and much of the food is home-made. There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance, there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from. Dennis, one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years, so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now. 

     I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.

     Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate, they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve. 

     Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49), Pizza  
Bread with various toppings, Gyros ($3.69), salads ($1.99 - $3.99), a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce. And lots more. I don't know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money, but I surely do hope they continue and prosper!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!! Excellent food at reasonable prices!!! It is clean and the service is outstanding. Worth a drive from anywhere in the valley. Goodbye Churches and hello Rocket Burger & Subs!!! May your stay be a long one!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! So a friend introduced me to this place and I have to say, I'm quite impressed. 

My first time there, after perusing the menu, I got a single \"gyro burger\". It's as awesome as it sounds! My friend and I ordered two combos, a 6 pack of their awesome classic soda collection and some chili cheese fries. 

The portions will fill ya'. 

The owner is very friendly and quite helpful if you're new to the menu. 

I loved \"Pop the Soda Shop\" and it moved all around AZ until, I guess they closed. I don't know if they merged or something, but they have everything they had there. All the sodas! 

I'm introducing another friend of mine to the place next week! I can't recommend  it enough!"}
{"text":"My husband and I been wanting to try this place and we finally did. Wasn't bad at all. The price is very reasonable and they have a great selection of root beers. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Great burger with many options for how'd you like it. Crazy amount of beverages, more than you could possibly imagine. Try it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and Yelp did not disappoint!!!  This place looks a bit iffy from the outside but once you enter everyone is friendly and inviting!  Iffy only in the sense that you aren't sure if the business is open or closed, busy not busy, etc as the windows are tinted fairly dark.  Do not let the outside scare you away, give it a try!  The selection of beverages is amazing and the burger selections are vast!  Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"I never noticed this place when I used to live on 35th and Greenway driving to work every day...man I missed out. Recently I decided to try it based on the good ratings/reviews. On the first visit I decided to try the Sante Fe burger (double) w/ habanero cheese that was nice and melted running down the sides of the patties, It was like biting into heaven. There is so much flavor packed into this thing its ridiculous...in a good way of course. First walking into this place was a little intimidating for me because I'm just weird like that. To the south wall  they have about a 24ft cooler of all kinds of sodas and to the west is where you order your food. The staff is VERY friendly and polite. If anyone is looking for a good ol local place to eat with a good variety of burgers, subs, sandwiches and drinks then give them a try, you will not be disappointed...and if you are then you are the one with the problem haha"}
{"text":"Solid food and a large selection of vintage sodas.
It was worth the drive :) had a burger and it was very good."}
{"text":"Excellent. Truly excellent. Rocket Burger has a huge menu with very creative burger concoctions, subs, sides and more. Ive only had the burgers, becasue they're SOO GOOD and I cant get anything else (yet) however, the subs that ive seen others get are massive, and look delicious. They make everything fresh and its obvious. Workers are polite and quick. Place is clean, not very big but it works. Now, the soda selection. Holy moly. They have any soda you can think of, and theres more at the \"Pop shop\" right next door. Pepsi and another craft soda that im not familiar with on fountain, and EVERYTHING else in bottles. All in all, great experience. One of my favorite hole in the walls in phoenix. Would recommend to anyone and everyone who loves a good burger and a cold soda."}
{"text":"THIS IS MY FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT IN ARIZONA. Everything in the menu is amazing. They can make burgers into salads which is a plus for me. They're super friendly and will answer any and all questions. We go here like once a week."}
{"text":"Yes, I know, this is my 2nd update so I'll try to make it short & sweet. 

I bought a Groupon about a week ago & decided to use it this past Saturday when the hubs & I were trying to think of a place to have lunch. I got the chili cheese dog this time & it was delicious! Cheese burger & onion rings were freakin yum as usual & I have to say the fries were better this time around. We went a lil crazy & got 4 additional sodas, along with the 2 we had during lunch, 2 root beers, 2 cream sodas & 2 orange sodas. I also have to add, since this was our 1st time dining in, how clean it was! They had a girl at the register this time & she was super sweet.

We love this place!!"}
{"text":"Was expecting a great burger after reading the reviews, but I honestly didn't even finish half of my burger because it was just disgusting. However, this was my first time here and I may have just ordered the wrong thing. Also, a warning for anyone who orders online they don't check the 'special instructions', as there were mushrooms all over my burger. It's a good thing that I'm not allergic. Overall, the burger wasn't made with quality ingredients and left the grossest feeling in my stomach and taste in my mouth. I feel bad saying that, but would have taken an in-n-out burger over that in a heart beat."}
{"text":"The coolest part of this place has to be the wall of the sodas. Bottled sodas that you've never heard of; I want to go back just to try more. I got two to take home: a Moxie for myself and this Japanese soda for my wife. The former was very old fashioned (I should have known by the Ted Williams poster they have displayed by the case) and not very good, at least to my taste. My wife's soda was a strawberry-flavored beverage with a really interesting bottle design and mechanism to open. It looked like a baby bottle and you use part of the top to open it...hard to explain.

As for the food, I had a chili cheese burger that was quite tasty. The burgers are served on large, soft buns perfect for their hefty burger creations. The chili was pretty sold, a firm B+ (nowhere can come close to the best chili cheeseburger in the world, which fyi, is at Tommy Burger in Los Angeles). The fries were just so so, not quite crispy enough.

I'll definitely be back and I'll come with an even bigger appetite, probably for the Philly Burger :)"}
{"text":"Man this place is great! Good burgers and the soda selection is out of this world. Have a friend from Kentucky who is able to get a ginger ale that he has been searching for since he got here around 8 years ago!"}
{"text":"Lots of sodas from everywhere.  Some from my childhood even! Good place to get a burger or even a rare  soda or something  new. Food is good could be better no matter  the location . My experience  was 5 star but this is a unique  place so I feel that  they should  be out of  the norm there are plenty  of burger joints near here but this one has all the desire to show here first. Maybe  they need to sponsor  a racecar or something  to say  hey we are here.  Great place love it"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I always struggle to decide amongst all of their yummy subs and countless drink choices. Their fries are delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with quality service.

They have an incredibly large variety of sodas. And management is perfect.

I appreciate places that show quality and care, not only in what they produce but also in how it's shown through customer service. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Was a good burger!  The soda selection is SO HUGE tried the root beer.  It's a lot of items to choose from my co worker got the hot dog said it was good with a milk shake.  I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"I found this burger joint on yelp, being from out of town yelp is a big help. We missed this restaurant the first time it's tucked in an unassuming strip mall right next to a church's fried chix.  We almost did not go in it was not impressive looking , but because of all the positive reviews we sucked it up and gave it a try . I had the double Teri burger ( lett, Tom , onion mayo,and pineapple) usually when I have a teri burger I omit the pineapple, what the heck does pineapple have to do with teriyaki? I did not omit the pineapple because they dip it in cornmeal and fry it, crazy,but good . The sauce was a little to thin. The burger was very good even with the runny sauce. The fries were made in house and very good , large portion. The owner or manager? Very friendly. We will be back"}
{"text":"Best damn burger in town hands down they will make almost anything to order! Their topped burgers are dynamite the fries are super. The chili OMG is absolutely out of freaking sight. Oh and the soda selection is perfect compliment to wash down all the amazing food they have to offer. Thank you guys for the best quality beef,  best service,  and damn yummy food love this place.."}
{"text":"Price for the quality.of food is excellent. I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in. The floors were dingy and most of the tables still had food on them. 

The menu is packed full of interesting combos or you can build your own sandwich. I chose the beast. A hot roast beef sandwich with roasted red peppers, horseradish mayo and all the usual lettuce tomato fixins. It was a stellar sandwich. My son got a build your own and it came out with lots of meat and veggies piled high. No skimping here. 

I took off one star because the bathrooms and floors aren't clean. They really need to be redone. I always wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen when I see dirty dinghy bathrooms."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of Phoenix's best kept secrets behind the Church's Chicken. The service is topnotch, the food is amazing, and the drink selection is up there with the best of them. 

I went there for the first time two days ago with my Mom. I got the recommendation from a couple of friends who share the same love of this kind of food that I do. I ordered the Afterburner Burger and it exceeded my expectations. It had just the right amount of heat. I also ordered fries and onion rings and they did not disappoint. My mom ordered the reuben and it looked pretty good.  The food prices are cheap which made the food taste even better.

Not only is the food good, but they have a huge selection of vintage soda that would blow your mind. They receive extra points for having the Texas born \"Dublin Dr. Pepper\" in stock. 

The owner doesn't talk much but the service is amazing. The ambiance is a little dive-y but it adds to the experience. 

All in all, Rocket burger is a great restaurant to chow down on your favorite foods."}
{"text":"Been here twice both times were great. Just a simple burger and sandwich place nothing fancy and that's what I want. I miss the burgers you get in SoCal and this place does it's own twist not the same but good enough. I wish they would pay as much attention to the fountain soft drinks as they to the bottle soft drinks the fountain drinks are a bit flat boring. The burgers are on point and I haven't had a bad one yet."}
{"text":"I love supporting local businesses, ESPECIALLY when they're within walking distance!  With Dennis manning the register and Steve and Raquel puttin' the eats together, this team of good people makes Rocket Subs AND MORE! a very nice eating experience.

Stop by and check out their exceptional selection of bottled sodas!"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall burger joint. The all beef hot dog was amazing. The pastrami burger was also fantastic. The bacon cheese burger is good, but not the best thing I've ever eaten. I think the sweetness of the rocket sauce takes away from the burger taste but overall is good. Amazing soda selection and I'll definitely be back. I would suggest a good scrub down and a fresh coat of paint for the place, but the food was great."}
{"text":"Amazing!! The New Yorker is addictive as well as the onion rings. The selection of soda is a blast. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and a crazy soda selection. Always have great customer service and I recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch, based on the reviews I was SO stoked for this burger and \"best onion rings\" and was disappointed. The burger was OK, like a whopper is ok. And the onion rings were some of the least flavorful I've tasted. I will not be returning for $12 burger, onion rings and drink meal. The soda selection is impressive but that's about it. Too bad I don't drink soda.  The girl at the counter was very pleasant though.
 I ordered the afterburner burger, and ate half of it; the sauce was very spicy and that was the highlight of the burger. Eh."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Skip the chains and get the REAL stuff here for less! HUGE selection of bottled sodas. Do not miss Rocket Burger & Subs!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The food is far and above any fast-food place you could go to.  Heck, you would probably pay less here and get superior food.  An Slush Puppie machine!? Crazy big bottled soda selection?! This place is a hidden jem that all should go to!"}
{"text":"10% off with Yelp check in!!! There is an amazing selection if soda pop. It makes my GF crazy when I call it pop. Location is not the best, but I never felt like I was in immediate danger. Good staff. Clean. Yummy stuff. If you are loitering around 35th ave and Cactus, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I'm not sure as to the reason behind the high rating for this organization, but IMHO, the food was fairly average. A letter grade of C-.  The fries had a sweet aftertaste, which for not being sweet potato fries was strange. The portion for the standard combo fries is rather large and would have been a plus if not for their sweetness. The burger itself was not particularly memorable, with its blending of flavors advertised (gyro double burger) into one creamy greesy taste. The soda choices however are large and encompassing so I'd your not a fan of Pepsi products, you've got choices. 

P. S. An item that did concern me was the cooks decision to take their smoke break at the kitchen door at front of the store. Eye contact was made along with a wiff of Tabacco when I walked in, followed by the uneasiness of watching the same cook enter the kitchen area while I was placing my order. I will not speculate if the cook had washed their hands or not, or whether they were the only cook on duty, but there was no sink in view of the front counter that was used upon their re-entry."}
{"text":"The burgers are really good, the staff is friendly, the soda fountain soda is delicious, and the variety of bottled sodas and drinks is on point!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here today.  I saw it on check please so I wanted to check it out.  The service was absolutely awful.  The guy taking our order was rude, wasn't helpful and wouldn't fully answer our questions.  We ordered a Cali chicken sandwich that had no taste and the bacon was way over cooked, and I like crispy bacon!  My husbands burger was eh, alright.  We ordered our food to eat there but the guy that took our order, that was staring us down as we picked out our sodas, gave us our food to go.  It was pretty obvious he wanted us to leave, but we stayed anyway.  We ate some of the food and left the rest.  Will never go back and will tell our friends to never go in the first place."}
{"text":"I would like to call this a burger review but that does not quite convey how different this place is. You know that friend who prides himself on his grilling skills? Combine that with a substantial bun and toppings not supplied by the lowest bidder and you have Rocket Burger. I scolded my kid thinking she was eating daddy's double. Nope just the single is huge! Super fast too!"}
{"text":"We want there for the first time 7 weeks ago.  We have been back weekly since even though it's a 20 minute drive for us.  My wife and I simply cannot stay away from the Afterburner burger.  The kids love the place with the great soda selection and the mini corn dogs.  Great place."}
{"text":"My head was spinning from the gourmet soda selection. It sort of overshadowed the food in this, my first trip. I had the Chicago style burger...the accoutrements were perfect, down to the last pickled relish drop. My only complaint is that the bun was sub-par...a nice, soft sesame seed bun would have made the burger more memorable. Burger to bun ratio was a little bit off. I will definitely return, and suggest you do the same!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and a good value! 

I've been going to Rocket Burger for years now and I can't get enough of it every time I pop in. Their Teriyaki burger is sublime, among the best I've had (including \"gourmet\" burgers) and the fries are the perfect balance between crunchy and fluffy. 

The selection of sodas are to die for, there's something for everyone. 

Though the price is more expensive than a meal at In-N-Out, the difference is well worth it. I spend around $8-10 every time I eat there for a burger, fries, and a bottled drink or two. 

This is definitely a must-have for anybody in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Great soda selection, delicious food...I love their chocolate ice cream cone, but they are almost always out of chocolate. The garlic chicken makes up for it though!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Gets a bump for being a friendly, family owned establishment on the Northwest side. Will be back. 

1) Afterburner fried chicken sandwich- Considering I don't eat beef or pork, I've had my fair share of fried chicken sandwiches. I would have to put this is the top 5 I've ever had- the breading was perfect, the veggies were fresh, but the rocket relish makes the sandwich unique and memorable. A legitimate \"spicy\" chicken sandwich.  

2) New York Burger- my wife decided to go for an extra meaty option, and she loved it. It comes with a burger patty, pastrami, and her husbands bacon from the chicken sandwich. Also cole slaw. She also said the fries were well seasoned. 

3) SO MANY SODAS- I'm not a huge soda drinker, but the sheer volume and variety is pretty amazing. Chocolate, bacon, and more root beer flavors than you can imagine are all options."}
{"text":"This place was unexpectedly good. Love their buns. Their was a ton of flavor. I had the philly and it was yummy. Their onion rings are good too. Lightly breaded and crispy."}
{"text":"Best SODA selection ever!!! Not opinion it's FACT

Solid sides and food, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Maybe I went in on the wrong night. I did takeout for my family last night. The staff was friendly, the service was prompt and the atmosphere was definitely unique in a good way. But, the food was not what we expected. The bread tasted sour, the meat was dry and the fries were nothing special. Rocket burger has been on my list of places to try for a while, and now that I had a chance to go I'm sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this place is the best especially all of the sodas they have. Every flavor, the burgers and fries are great with the special sauce. I would love to go back in the near future."}
{"text":"Best Chicago dog I've had in a long time. Tons of fancy sodas to choose from and even though I'm not a shoestring fry person the were seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly and helpful.  Portion size was perfect.  Fries were tasty.  Had a New Yorker as recommended by the staff and was not disappointed.  The soda selection is amazing and worth the trip on its own.

The only weirdness is the restroom.  It's shared male/female and the door won't lock.  Hmmmm.......

All in all .... OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"Eh..maybe I went on an off day. Or maybe I shouldn't have ordered a hotdog. I got the Chicago, my wife, a regular. It was decent but not worth the drive for me. Should of stuck with regular fries... the chili cheese fries were pretty gross... and I'm a huge fan of chili cheese fries. However, their soda wall is impressive! Tons of great choices. $1.99 per bottle. I guess that's the going price, but wish it was less... Pretty gross location and the inside was clean but smelled of grease. I guess I should of assumed that walking in.

It's not terrible, but not great. Prices were decent overall and the service was fast and friendly. I'd only go back if I was in the area which I doubt I'll be any time soon."}
{"text":"Best Burger I have ever had. My friends and I finished our burgers in less than 15 mins because of how good each one was. The fries were crispy and tasty. The meat itself was cooked to perfection and it all tasted great and left a smile on all our faces. Definitely try it out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Rocket burger has the best milkshakes in town. My lactose intolerance was cured. (Not cured by the milkshakes it was some godly miracle if you're lactose intolerant wait until you get help) good burgers"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! I have been going here for years and they never dissapoint..their New Yorker sandwich is the best!! And they have really good burgers too..I moved to downtown Phoenix but I go back there because I can't get that sandwich anywhere else...I wish they had another location close to me"}
{"text":"I can not believe that I have not reviewed this place yet with as much as I go there! 

I have been  going to Rocket Burger for a couple of years now and on a regular basis... maybe 2-3 times per month. I have NEVER been disappointed. 

I get the Cali Burger which has bacon (which is always crispy) and avocado (which is always perfectly ripe).  It also has rocket sauce  on it which is like no other \"secret\" sauce I have had before. You just have to try it.  The amazing bun that the hamburger comes with is more like a crusty roll type bread rather than the standard seeded bun. 

The fries are good, but overshadowed by how amazing their burgers are. 

The soda selection is like nothing I have ever seen before. Hundreds of choices. Bottled sodas from across the nation and soda I have not seen in years! 

Oh and the service - they are great! They actually thank you for coming in and say by when you leave. They know who I am (as they should since I go there so often), but they really give it a personal touch! 

This is my#1 burger joint - hands down! So glad I work so close to this place!

You would be a fool not to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING BURGERS!!!! The owner is just about the nicest man alive! I always go for the spicy ghost pepper burger!!!! The soda selection is out of this world you can find anything from grape to pickle and even bacon soda! This is a cool landmark spot to bring your buddies or yourself to!"}
{"text":"Dave was craving a cheeseburger sub, which I thought were nonexistent out here; however, after a quick search on yelp we found this place and it wasn't too far, only about 10 miles. I was hoping to find that little gem, but unfortunately I didn't. I had a single cheeseburger, I liked everything except the rocket sauce...no matter what you call it, it's 1000 island on all these burgers (In/Out, McD's and every other burger place with special sauce is either straight up 1000 island or some variant of it), and normally I like it; however, I did not care for this particular version. It was watery.  I did like the actual burger.

Again, I'm a lover of onion rings and I was super excited to see all the great reviews, until I actually tried them. I didn't care for them at all. The breading was horrible, I ate them because I was hungry...the breading did not grow on me! 

The selection of sodas was amazing, they have an extensive menu, the prices are extremely reasonable, the service friendly, the customers eclectic, but the overall quality of the meal was just 3 stars for me."}
{"text":"I wish I would have found this place must sooner!! Rocket Burger & Subs, where have you been?  This place is amazing!  Their food is fresh ~ cooked after it's ordered.  They have several burger and sandwich options to chooses from with different sides.  They have the LARGEST cola in a bottle selection I've ever seen and they have super service!

Food~ Rocket burger was awesome! burger patties cooked to perfection and trimmed to fit on a sub role.  The role was fresh and my burger came with lots of veggies and dressing.  The fries were awesome ~ cooked fresh like mom makes them.  We also had their onion rings based on the Yelp reviews, YUM!  The cola selection is mind blowing! I'm going to keep coming back until I've tried each one : -)"}
{"text":"I must say, I was impressed by how savory and delicious the food was! I got the new york burger: one of the best burgers I ever had. It was to die for! All the ingredients were well balanced. The pastrami in the burger was so tender and juicy. The coleslaw had a lot of great flavor to it, along with the tasty sauce. 

I really enjoyed the French fries. Some of my favorite french fries. 

My husband had the Cali burger. The cheese in it looked so luscious on top of the patties, bacon, and avocado that I had to try it. I definitely recommend the Cali and new york burger. The bread, ingredients, and protein were all incredibly delicious and my taste buds can concur! ;)"}
{"text":"Our first time here and it was fantastic!! The staff were friendly and our burgers were made to perfection. I get a \"bunless\" type and wasn't disappointed with the generous lettuce and tomato under the delicious meat. 
My hubby got the \"after burner\" and it was definitely spicy and delicious!!
The fries were a little on the salty side but still yummy. 
Would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass hamburger.  No hamburger extraordinaire could go unsatisfied.  The burgers come on sesame submarine buns so they are quite bigger than most. The fries are a tad sloppy and they have the largest selection of craft soda I've ever seen.  If you ate everyday you'd be the biggest man on the planet, but a satisfied one at that."}
{"text":"Went here with the family and it was delicious! Really love their selection of glass bottled sodas too! Picked up a few cases for a birthday party. We're definitely going to go back to eat and have a soda. BUT the ONLY thing we didn't like is the sticky floor."}
{"text":"Love to see local businesses like this! The food was so good and the service was awesome! Loved all the unique sodas they had available to try and buy! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with a wide variety of choices...burgers, subs, hot dogs, deli sandwiches.  The sides are amazing...cheese curds to die for, fried zucchini that tastes straight from the garden, battered onion rings that melt on your tongue.  Fun array of designer sodas.  Ordering online speeds up the process during lunch rushes.  The people are extremely helpful and friendly.  I ordered a large amount of food for a football gathering and they even carried my food to my car for me.  Forget fast food.....I was out of there in 4 minutes.  My bucket list now includes everything on their menu."}
{"text":"A few months ago I set out to find the best burger in town. I tried The Grind, Wineburger, and a couple of others but none can top Rocket Burger.  It was the best cheeseburger I have ever had, by a mile! I ordered a double cheeseburger with everything. The bun was toasty yet soft, the veggies were fresh, the meat was perfect, and the thousand island sauce was the icing on the cake. I had the fries and the onion rings as well. Both were just mediocre in my opinion. The beverage selection was huge and beyond awesome! If you are looking for a great burger at a great price look no further. No other burgers  can compare! I am going to have to work out harder because I plan on going back to eat there very often!

Went back today just to make sure it was going to be as good as the first time. I honestly could not believe a burger could be this good. Guess what? It was just as amazing the second time!!!"}
{"text":"First time there. So I wanted to play it safe, not go for any wild things. Just try standard fare and work up to others later. I figured if they can't get the basics right, maybe I don't go back.

My wife had a single cheeseburger, I had the double regular. We ordered these as combos, expecting regular French fries. We were quite surprised at the fries that arrived - scrawny, over-cooked, oily, not good flavor, and a strange orange tint to them. The burgers were better than the fries, however, I believe they put too much sauce on them - it was dripping everywhere, making it a difficult eat. (I prefer a burger that stays together and keep a fairly dry bun, not soggy like ours.) Also, the meat was still pink in the middle. If I get a big, fat patty like at Fuddruckers, a medium burger is OK, but on these thin little patties at Rocket Burger, pink inside is just not appealing.

Despite all this, I did enjoy the flavor of the burger, and could have actually eaten another (if I ordered with very easy sauce).

The big plus for this place that saved the experience for me was the management. I guess I was chatting with one of the owners when I was there, and he was very polite and cordial. I mentioned the name of the guy who recommended this place to me, and barely started to describe him, when he knew who I was talking about and where I know him from.

I will go back based entirely on the friendliness I experienced there. Only thing is, this time, I'll order some real kind of sandwich, and go for a different side item than their \"standard\" fries."}
{"text":"Driven by several times never knew they were here.  Good flavor, lots of variety.  Good portions.  Lots on menu i will try soon.   Clean for an older strip mall shop.  Great variety of bottled sodas. Good seasoned fries. . Onion. Rings looked good will try those next time.  Always great to give a non big chain shop a good review, these guys earned it!"}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix for one day while on a big road trip. Being from out of town, we got lost trying to get there, but it was totally worth it. 

The soda selection alone was worth the trip, but the sandwiches were really top-notch too. The fries were thin-cut and really tasted like potato. They were fried fairly dark, and some of them were limp by the time we got them back to the hotel, but I've never had fries that stayed crispy after being transported in Styrofoam, so it's hard to say what they would have been like fresh from the fryer. I thought they were delicious. 

 The Teriyaki burger featured Teriyaki sauce that was flavorful (not super salty) and, most importantly, DEEP FRIED PINEAPPLE RINGS. I ordered the Italian sub and sort of regretted not getting something more unique, but the sandwich was probably the best I've had since moving away from the Philadelphia area. The lunchmeat seemed high quality and the bread tasted fresh.

We ate at a lot of great places during our road trip and this was definitely a highlight."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!! My brother informed me of this place some time ago and I have been there several times. Each and every visit is a delight :) I had just stopped in yesterday for the first time in a while (a bit too long for my liking) and was pleased to see the same wall of soda, menu I craved, simple friendly service and all around good vibe that I have come to pursue. If you have never been, go try it and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has some great deals on great food. The burgers are wonderful and the soda selection is amazing."}
{"text":"New Yorker Pastrami Sandwich! Amaze-balls! Yum! Awesome cut of pastrami with fine cut cole slaw and an amazing sauce that could possibly contain a spicy mustard. Not sure. I just know the combo worked quite well.

Hub got a bacon cheeseburger and liked it very much. French fries were like shoe string type.

We also got some Dads Red Cream Soda and Orange Cream Soda from their vast array of sodas. Very good!

The counter dudes were very nice and helpful and probably deserve raises because they actually care about providing good customer service! Good job guys! I'll will definitely be visiting this place more often."}
{"text":"I saw all the great reviews for this place and decided to try them. The New York burger was terrible. Thin flavorless  patty and the bun was not fresh. The only good part of the order were the onion rings and fries. For the money Five Guy's or even In and Out Burger are so much better. Don't  waste your time or money. What a shame!"}
{"text":"Definitely good food.  However, I wouldn't get the Santa-Fe burger next time as the fried chillies were really big, not what I expected, and dominated the burger.  I ended up taking them off.

Everyone in party had good things to say about the food.

10% off for checking in on Yelp, just can't beat it!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I am a faithful customer and I even recommend it to people I work with in the East Valley all of the time.  Items I have had (and enjoyed) as well probably should have made more than one meal out of:
-Rocket Burger
-New York Burger
-Cali Burger
-Santa Fe Burger
-Philly Burger
-Gyro Burger
-Western Burger
-Red White & Blue Burger
-California Club Sub
-Country Club Sub
-New Yorker Sub
-Gyro
-Pescado de Cohete
 I still have quite a bit of items I want to try but hands down this is the best burger and sub place I have EVER been to in Arizona and I am an AZ native.  I always try to give tips as well due to the fact that 1) I support local business 2) The owners and staff are very professional and cordial 3) the food is always well prepared not just slapped together like a typical fast food business"}
{"text":"Holy !##=. What a great local sandwich place. My wife and I had a French dip and Italian. Reminds me of little family owned joints in Philly. We finished it off with chili cheese fries, awesome."}
{"text":"Great burger! Eddie Lopez is delicious. So flavorful & juicy. The fries are so incredible. Skin on. Seasoning salt on. Mmmm. The rocket sauce is so bomb. Ask for some on the side to dip your fries in. California club is a little simple, but nice real turkey (not sandwich meat). Loved the bottled soda selection!
Laid back, very clean but simple break room-style tables."}
{"text":"The fish is to die for.  Breaded on site, not processed crap.  Large portioned and delicious!!!  Friendly people and a LARGE selection of drinks.  Well known for their burgers, but I will be back for the fish!!"}
{"text":"Best burger, fried zucchini, chicken sandwich , onion rings & most variety of vintage sodas in Arizona!  We come here as often as possible! Inexpensive, fresh, casual & delicious."}
{"text":"This place was an epic burger joint!  Small but don't let that fool you, the food is super good.  As soon as I walked in the joint, the smell of food was a hit.  I had the double bacon cheese burger with cheese curds and was pretty darn tasty. Definitely a return will be in the works.  The house Rocket sauce in burger is a nice twist."}
{"text":"Fries were good. Burger so so hot dog was inedible.
Disappointed for sure. 
Just stay away from the jerky dog and your probably ok."}
{"text":"Never let's me down, this place rocks!!  The food is great and just for kicks all the soda pop you can think of in the coolers. Keep up the great food."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times and tonight just kinda ruined it for me. I do want to add that they are always super nice when we come in. Customer service is always good! To start on my visit tonight, I got a chili cheese dog and this was probably my first mistake seeing that they closed in about an hour. The chili was cold so I asked nicely to have them to throw it in the microwave to just heat it up. It wasn't that big of a deal, although it did suck because who wants cold food?? When he brought it back it sadly was still barely warm but I didn't wanna ask again so just dealt with it. Once I started eating it I now noticed that the dog was probably sitting on a rotator for half the day. It was super dry/crusted almost half way throughout. If this makes any sense. Just imagine the hot dogs that have been over cooked at a gas station, that's what I got. I've worked in the food industry and I know limits, but at some point you just have to accept it and make fresh food. Now to put the cherry on the top, we were getting a refill to take to-go and I noticed while putting the lid on that something had fallen from the drink nozzle and I'm pretty sure it was mold. There was a large black piece floating in my cup (I was drinking lemonade). So I just threw it away. I wanna give them the benefit of the doubt because the burgers are pretty good! But I don't recommend eating there before they close, nor getting a hot dog and lastly drinking from the fountain. They have plenty of bottled drinks, spend a few more cents and get mold free sodas! I don't know if we will be back. But if I do I will be avoiding all those things!"}
{"text":"Ummmmm wait a minute... there's one in CHANDLER too???  Oh boy... One close to home annnnnnd one close to work... HAPPY DANCE... usually a sequel suxs, unless you're Francis Ford or ROCKET BURGER & SUBS... nice job guys.  Keep up the good work..."}
{"text":"This place has the best cheeseburger I have ever eaten. And they have great prices for a burger combo too. The selection of bottle sodas is huge too. I will definitely come back here time and time again. Thank you! GO TIGERS!"}
{"text":"Burgers suck, thin and dried meat, expensive as my four year old put it in and out has better burgers. The Great soda selection is the only saving grace."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork i have found in Phoenix!! And love the drink selection found a huckleberry cream soda I drove 1200 miles to get last time!! New favorite!
Can't wait to go back for another sandwich and after reading other reviews onion rings I think. Ugh but Which of the bagillion sodas to choose from??!? and def trying The ice cream..... Tomorrow for real."}
{"text":"My bacon cheeseburger was unpleasant. The bacon was burnt way past the point of overdone. It left the worse after taste. After I picked off the bacon, I then had the pleasure of digging a black hair out of my cheese. I tried to ignore this as I was starving but the burger itself was drowning in the sauce they use which tasted like it belongs on a salad. The meat didn't have much flavor. The table I sat at was dirty and the walls are crusty. It was not memorable. The fries were good but I also got tons of ends and not the usual full sized fries. Probably won't be back because I just left so disappointed even though I was initially looking forward to just a good burger locally."}
{"text":"The only thing i can review is the cheesecurds. The ones that had cheese inside were pretty good. Unfortunately half my order was tiny pea sized crispy things.  And I paid an extra $1 for a tiny ranch and bbq sauce. I wouldn't have gotten had I known,  since there's sauce in my fridge. But hey,  this place specializes in burgers which I did not try. They do look yummy though"}
{"text":"Totally satisfied my craving for that super delicious sloppy heart attack hole in the wall dive joint burger and fries!"}
{"text":"Great food, huge selection of sodas. The best thing though was the ranch dressing!  Awesome service as well."}
{"text":"They have a huge variety of sodas available, but their food is sub par. Kind of greasy and overpriced."}
{"text":"Three different burgers for our family and all winners!  I highly recommend the Santa Fe burger as the best I have ever had.  Green chili peppers smashed and fried with a light cornmeal batter and added to the cheeseburger. Note that a \"single\" is definitely a lot of food, so only the big eaters will go for the next size up. Fried cheese curds are a treat and a basket is more than plenty for three.  Finding out that the Pop Shop has become part of Rocket Burger & Subs is a wonderful bonus:  imagine choosing from over 200 soft drinks for a memorable meal.  Staff were terrific and perhaps think about going early in the dinner hour.  We noticed as it got closer to 6 pm, more and more customers came in. We'll be back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"We love going here for the soda selection.  The food is good but not amazing.   The chill cheese fries are to grease but the portions are very good."}
{"text":"Everyone enjoyed their meals today! We got burgers, chicken salad with grilled green chilies, chicken nuggets, fries and all kinds of crazy pops! The nuggets are homemade. Felt like my Granny was cooking in the back! Delicious!"}
{"text":"It's a little hole in the wall place. The hamburger buns are the best I have ever had. They have a wall full of bottled sodas to choose from.  The food is great."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place on Yelp. I've passed it for years unaware it was there. Had Chicago burger, it was amazing!  Cheese curds were great! Yes, salty.. but that is how they should be. I'll absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"My friend's daughter had been here before and the online menu looked interesting.  We had four burgers total, 2 Cali, 1 Bacon Cheeseburger and 1 Garlic Melt.  All were excellent.  We also ordered cheese curds (delicious!), onion rings & mushrooms.  I liked that the batter was very light for the fried items. Again, everything was tasty.  We ordered pick-up through Yelp and GrubHub and our order was ready on time.  I don't live in the area, but will definitely go back if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My first time here.....I have not even eaten the food and I will already come back.  The people working here are amazing!!! They will help toy customize anything you want!   Also such a huge selection of soda!  

The food was very good.   Juicy burgers, perfectly made.  Cheese curds were good and fries were nice and crispy.   

We will come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is awesome. The Mexican hot dog is to die for. They make their own salsa and it tasted like they make their own bread too. The fries were fresh. And my husband and I both ate lunch for less than 8 bucks. I ate here on a Sunday and walked in at 1030. I didn't notice that they don't normally open until 11 but the guy was super cool and warned me it would take an extra few minutes, but had no problem serving me. It was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Landed in this little sweet-spot accidentally today, just looking for a kid-friendly burger place that could accommodate a vegetarian. I'm SO impressed! I took an employee up on his recommendation for the cole-slaw Mexican fish sandwich, and was not disappointed. The owner even came out and introduced himself and asked how our food was personally! I'll be coming back any time I'm in the area for sure. Thanks for the great meal, guys! (PS this place has beer too!)"}
{"text":"Ordered their Philly burger, and it was so flavorful and juicy. They had the biggest selection of soda I've ever seen. Such friendly staff, too!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an A+ burger, amazing side and a one of a kind soda with no muss or fuss, THIS is the place to go! This is a small little joint but great cooks service and a wide selection of subs, sides, sodas and burgers. 10/10 will be back"}
{"text":"Everyone who is a foodie knows that the best places to eat are A) Not a chain and B) Are located in \"a hole in the wall.\"
Being wheat intolerant, I can't give any place 5 stars that doesn't have a gluten-free bun option. That said, EVERYTHING else was very good. 
Food is flavorful through and through. I ended up risking on a Rueben. I figure if I have an allergic reaction I'm going to make it worth it. And it was 100% worth it. I scarfed all of it down! No looking back 
Drinks are FABULOUS! I have seen soooo many varieties of soda! I had a ginger beer from a \"microbrew\" in New Hampshire. Its recipe boasts of being 152 years old. 
If you are near 35th Ave and Cactus stop by here!"}
{"text":"Food was great! My husband loved the teriyaki burger. I got the Santa Fe Burger with avocado which was really good as well.  I really liked how the owner came out and talked with all of the customers. Will be returning."}
{"text":"First time coming here and we weren't disappointed. One of the best Rubens I've have in Arizona, everyone else in my party had burgers. The California, Bacon & cheese, and a cheese burger. Everyone was very happy with they're orders. Also tried the onion rings and cheese curds. Both were great. Great people behind the counter and very friendly. Can't wait to keep trying  more of the menu."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  I got the Afterburner with onion rings and both were excellent!  There were so many sodas it was impossible to decide on one, so I just picked a category (Root Beer) and grabbed one -- quite tasty as well."}
{"text":"Small and very hidden behind Church's Chicken but food is EXCELLENT but....... kind of pricey. LOVE the idea of every glass soda/drink you can think of displayed in the dining area for you to easily browse and select....SERIOUSLY, SO MANY OPTION. Super super cool also you can pay to take home a little six pack of a variety of different drinks you want! Awesome little joint!"}
{"text":"The hype was not hype. Great concept, original menu items and great food. The staff was awesome as well. Do yourself a favor and order the Santa Fe burger and enjoy a great bottle of soda. Today, like right now. Tell them Aaron sent you."}
{"text":"There prices are a little high but they make up for it in taste and selection. If your in the mood for a good burger then you must try this place"}
{"text":"The reviewers on \"Check Please\" were right.  This funky little place that I never would have walked into if I hadn't heard about it prior, is really good!  I had the New Yorker, which is as close as I can get to a Miracle Mile New Yorker in NW Phoenix, which was pretty darned good.  My husband had the New York Burger which the same thing with a hamburger patty added to the pastrami and he loved it also.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that they serve the string type French fries which I'm not a fan of and wouldn't order next time.  Good luck trying to decide which soda you'll have - they surround the room."}
{"text":"Amazing burger, fantastic cheese curds, and soda, soda, and more soda. Fun place to come and try new flavors of soda."}
{"text":"Great little place with cheap, good food. Ruben sandwich with chili cheese fries - great lunch!"}
{"text":"If only I could give this place 50 stars...  They really do force me to grade every other eatery on a curve..  I've been coming here about twice a week for a year now and it just keeps getting better.  The staff is welcoming and eager to please, the selection approaches infinity, the value is absolutely unbeatable, and the food... OH MY GOD THE FOOD!!!

I've had so many amazing experiences here.  Like how we mentioned to the owners how cool it would be if they offered ice cream, only to find a whole slew of ice cream treats we never would've dreamed of a month later.  Like how I mentioned that I missed the Flathead Lake Blueberry Pomegranate soda (I wanted to try it in a float now that they had ice cream), and I came in 2 days later to find new ones in the freezer and a full case on the rack.  Or the time my girlfriend and I just stopped and stared at each other after our first bites of our Red, White and Blue Special burgers on the 4th of July.  Or my feeble attempt to finish a 3-patty-on-a-sub-roll Rocket Burger by myself on my first visit...

I've tried just about everything on the menu and have yet to be disappointed.  All of the burgers are incredible, but my personal favorites are the Philly Burger, The Afterburner, Teriyaki Burger, Steak Burger, and the Red,White & Blue Burger.  The Pescado de Cohete, a zesty spicy citrus fish sandwich, is a must try, as is the chicken (sandwich or nuggets).  And don't get me started on the subs...  I'm halfway through trying them all and picking a favorite just depends on my mood, none have disappointed me.  Same goes for the hot dogs.

The sides are perfect as well.  Aside from the MOST ADDICTIVE FRIES AND RANCH IN THE WORLD, they also have cheese curds, pizza bread, OVER 300 SODAS, SLUSH PUPPIES, and one-of-a-kind treats like PECAN PIE SHAKES!!!  On top of all of this, they're the best value ANYWHERE.  Where else can you get a $4 burger combo this epic???  I challenge anyone to leave hungry!

Every time I come here I think it just doesn't get any better.  But then I come back and they prove me wrong.  Long live Rocket Burger!!!"}
{"text":"I like to try a lot of different burger places. I run across a lot of places that I really want to like, and don't. This was the exception. Excellent burgers and sandwiches, and friendly staff. We will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Most amazing burgers ever. And I am picky. My family loves it here and the prices are not bad at all. Subs are great too! And the fries with ranch are my daughters favorite. You have to try this place. Thank me later ;)"}
{"text":"We found this place thru Yelp... My son and I were longing for a good new place to try. 

It's located about a mile away East  from the Chandler Fashion Mall. 
We walked in and were immediately Wow'd by ALL the unique soda choices. Like Soooo many unique bottles and flavors. 
Now to the food..... 
It took me literally 15 min to decide on a burger. 
I ended up getting one that had like a garlic mayo, bacon, cheese forgot the name. I got the double. Good size and delicious. 
My son got the Cali burger, Rocket Size which means it's 3 patties and served side by side on a toasted sub roll. Sooo big and I liked his burger more than mine. 
We shared chili cheese fries, good but I've had better chili. 

They serve a weird brand fountain soda. It's made with cane sugar. It was yummy actually, just don't try the ginger flavor. Yuck!!! Burned my throat!! 

Staff was friendly. Small restaurant, counter service with a couple outside tables. 

We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Friendly management, excellent service, high quality food at an extremely reasonable price, what's not to love? In the city of Chandler it just doesn't get better than Rocket Burger! I consider myself very fortunate to live so close to this awesome new addition to the east valley."}
{"text":"I go there about once a week or week and a half. They have good burgers and a decent selection. Much prefer it over standard burger joints. Not that it matters to me, but they also seem to have about 1000 different brands (or more) of items to drink for anyone looking for that special soda they cannot find anywhere."}
{"text":"The food was great and so was the service. I ordered the Newyork Burger and orders a soda from the wall of unique flavors and brands, I definitely recommend it. The food came quickly,  the only thing I could say wrong was the trash area needed some cleaning."}
{"text":"Super Yummy!! Got the NY burger,  Gyros Burger,  fries and onion rings!  BAMM! ! All home runs... don't get the brain wash soda.  Heheheeeehe"}
{"text":"I've been here before and I have to say I wasn't that impressed. This time I decided to be a bit more adventurous and went for the NY Burger. Oh man! Rocket Burger is now on my radar screen! Wow! I never would have put that burger together in a million years... and I would have been missing out. EXCELLENT burger. I will be back."}
{"text":"I would have never probably stopped at this place driving by but it is worth it. I got a chilli chesse dog, burger, and fries. The burger was really good not the best ever but still really tasty and the bun was amazing. The chilli chesse dog was one of the best ive had deffinatly a trip worth going back to but this is my first review so take it or leave it but i will be reviewing more"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious, the Soda Wall was intense."}
{"text":"My husband decided it was a no cook day and that he wanted a burger (a romantic at heart). We stumbled upon this little gem while searching for non-dumpster restaurants in the area. We love local spots with great reviews. We decided to give Rocket Burger a try. Upon arriving, a fairly tall gentleman with an impressive midsection was stepping out of the restaurant and exclaimed to no one in particular \"Damn! That was the best burger I've had\" surely he's had many before this one. My husband and I looked at each other and smiled while entering the restaurant. We were immediately greeted by the cashier, cook, and owner(?) who all took great interest in ensuring we got exactly what we wanted. All the staff were very friendly and took pride in what they do. And the food, oh my! The food is amazing. Husband got the Teri and I chose something? with mushrooms and swiss cheese (my default). The craft sodas definitely kept us busy while they prepared our food, there are so many it was difficult to choose our favorite. We have visited several times, and continue to experience the same greatness, in fact we are on our way now. Come join us!"}
{"text":"I just tried Rocket Burger for the first time after reading some great things on here, but it didn't quite match my expectations.

The main reason that I think this place is rated too high is that the food is just average. The sauce on the burger is nice, but there is nothing else really special about the burger and the fries are kind of lousy.

The service however is pretty good. The guys working here are certainly friendly, so I am all for supporting an independent location like this. The various sodas they have here are cool to look at, but a little overwhelming. I couldn't figure out what to get or what was supposed to be good, so I just stuck with a regular fountain Pepsi.

The location of the place is not very good and it looks more like a convenient store than a restaurant. That was one thing I didn't like about eating here. It was an alright experience on the whole though."}
{"text":"Lived here a long time. One of the best burger joints in town. Insane soda selection. Gotta try it. Love this place."}
{"text":"Great food, I definitely recommend the fried mushrooms. We ordered online and our order did not register in their system when we showed up 30 min later to pick it up. They were really apologetic about it though, and it wasn't a big deal as it only took about 10 minutes to make our order. A free soda or something would have been appreciated for the wait though!"}
{"text":"First time here and half mile out of our way but worth the trip! I came here with my parents who are in their 80's. They too enjoyed it. We had the Cali chicken combo special. It's grilled chicken with bacon, avocado, lettuce & tomato. Delicious! We did drive past it at first. It's not obvious. It's next to the Church's chicken. It's small & quaint."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go for some cornmeal crusted zucchini and pretty much all of their sandwiches! They also sell a lot of old fashioned cola in various flavors (hundreds of them) - non of them with high fructose syrup either! Delicious and a real novelty experience. Plus the owners are super nice. : )"}
{"text":"This place was great, probably one of the best fast food burgers I have had in Arizona.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! The burgers were perfectly cooked. We had the Cali Burger and the New Yorker. We shared half of each and neither one of us could decide which we liked better. Loved them both! Daughters had kids chicken fingers and they were actual chicken, not just mostly fried breading with little chicken. Girls also had milkshakes that were thick and full of flavor! The staff was extremely nice, helpful and had wonderful suggestions. Will come back many, many more times! Thank you Rocket Burger for a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Best Burgers in town. Can't go wrong with anything u order. Owner is so nice and the handcrafted drinks are a must have experience. I ordered the chicken sandwich with avacado and bacon. First bite, fell in love. The cheese curds and zucchini are also amazing.  The owner was so welcoming and made us feel right at home. Must visit place for the perfect burger!"}
{"text":"Meh..the chili on the cheese dog had a weird flavor and their seating area is super cramped. The service was good, soda selection was nice and the burger was average to slightly above...I wouldn't make a special trip, but if you are in the area, give them a try. :)"}
{"text":"I go here several times every month.  For lunch and dinner.  I have never been disappointed.   Burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs and fries.  It is all good.  

My favorite is the Mexi-burger.  Fresh salsa, avocado, bacon, pepper jack and much more.  A great burger.

And then there is the great collection of soda.  My wife loves the fact that they carry her favorite \"Rock n Rye\" Faygo pop.  Straight from MI.

This place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove down to Chandler from Tempe  to try this place.  We really enjoyed the burgers and sides.  Excellent quality and creative.  Huge pop selection.  Met Steve the owner - nice guy, great concept of sub/burger joint.  We will be  bacK for more!"}
{"text":"All I know is. The Hubs and I were hungry so I yelped a burger joint in PHX. I was all Bae this place has 254 reviews .. Let's go there ! We were in PHX from Prescott for the day. Got the Teriyaki Burger Rocket size and fries ! delishioursh ! Hit The Spot ! The owner even chased us to the parking lot to make sure we enjoyed our Food  Yay!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time coming today after reading their reviews.  I had the Philly Cheese Steak Burger, and it did not disappoint.  Decent sized patty covered with thin slices of steak, peppers, onions, and a gooey slice of cheese melted on top and all inside a toasty bun...DELISH!!  Also ordered a side of fried zucchini, which I thought was really good, but a little on the greasy side.  If you like a good greasy burger, then this may be your place.  The decor isn't very fancy, but they have a huge soda selection, and several different burger choices."}
{"text":"Hands down best burger I've had in a long time.  Ordered a garlic melt, very tasty! The service was great;  love the Soda selection too."}
{"text":"Amazing! The fish sandwich is SO good, fries are amazing and soda selection is fun!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! Can't believe I have never been to this place before. A must go place in PHX. Had the philly burger and country club sandwich on wheat, and both were on point."}
{"text":"Good customer service.  Clean dinning area.  Knowledgeable staff.

I had the large New Yorker pastrami sub and fried zucchini , my wife had a large turkey bacon avocado sub on wheat and fries.

The food was tasty and very large portion wise.  
You definitely get you money's worth in food.

Their soda collection is vast, eclectic and nostalgic.

I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Love this place, you cannot find a better burger. Wish they had an east valley location!"}
{"text":"This place is Legit! Had such a good meal and the soda selection really is awesome! A whole wall dedicated to different sodas in glass bottles! My Gorlfriend had pumpkin pie soda and I had butterscotch root beer and it was delicious!! 

Definitely a win for local restaurants!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem.  Came here today for the first time. We weren't sure what to order and the young man behind the counter recommended the NY Burger which is what we order. Also we ordered the fries and the fried zucchini. The burger was cooked perfectly and it had a wonderful flavor. The fries were good and the zucchini was outstanding! The service was quick and friendly. Will go back. The drawback is a small parking lot and seating is limited."}
{"text":"WOW ~ CRAZY - A pepperoni pizza burger ! This is one of the best. The crispy pepperoni was the star of the show. After I was done, I picked out some great sodas to take home. Rocket Burger ROCKS"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden food gem in the heart of Chandler worth exploring!

I got a Gyro Burger with fries on the side and a bottle of ginger ale.  This place lives up to its name; that burger exploded in my mouth with beefy lamb flavor when I flew it in!  It also wasn't too overwhelming because the burger included tomatoes and cucumbers to cut back on the rich, savory explosion from the beef patties and gyro meat.  

Just when I thought the food in this restaurant is great, I also learned the atmosphere is friendly, too.  Steve, the owner, approached my friend and me while we were chowing down.  We had a really pleasant conversation, and apparently Rocket Burger has been open for only 4 months now.  Yet this place was the first result when I simply Yelped for 'Food in Chandler, AZ'.  If you ask me, that's a pretty impressive feat, to say the least.

When I come back, I'm getting the Green Chile Burger.  I gotta get me that extra crunchy, yet still juicy experience from the fried chili inside.  Maybe I'll even get it Rocket-sized."}
{"text":"Big fan! Reminds us of the mom 'n pop burger joints back in Michigan. Plus they have 8 refrigerators full of every type soda pop you can imagine! Stuff you've never heard of! And their ice cream is the yummiest & creamiest I've ever had."}
{"text":"Really good burger and fries, lots of tasty grub for the money.  Custom sodas and the girl who took our order was very friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Delicious Bacon cheese burger. Great fries. Clean and friendly. Not a fancy place but I will be taking mom here."}
{"text":"My experience was meh honestly...but that is probably because I didn't order a burger. Being more of a sandwich guy myself I figured I should try a sub first...mistake. I ordered the New Yorker, and it is a good thing I only got a small because anything more would have been a complete waste of money, because I didn't want to eat any more than the half I ate. 

Bread is a big deal to me, it's what sets a good sandwich apart from the greats...and it can make a sandwich go from good to just meh in just 1 bite...unfortunately their bread is basically just an overgrown hotdogs bun...WAY too soft...the bread was so soft it basically started to disintegrate after the first bite. Maybe their burger buns and regular bread are better but the sub rolls...no go.

Meat and cheese was ok...but there definitely was not enough meat that is for dang sure. And I'm not sure if it was the pastrami or the rocket sauce but something tasted like roasted red peppers, not a bad thing..must very unexpected. 

Coleslaw was the best part of the sandwich but weirdly the slaw and slaw dressing were not mixed...like it was just cabbage and then dressing on top...weird. Good balanced flavor though. 

Lastly the cheese curds...were sad. Over Salted and weirdly dusty? Like the batter or dredge was too much flour and it didn't get fully cooked because it honestly tasted like cheesy salty wallpaper paste. Strange. 

Side note the Ginger Beer from the fountain was meh as well. 

I would be willing to come back for a burger but I won't order a sub again."}
{"text":"Another soon to be favorite hole in the wall places! Great food. Showed up 10 mins before close and they were super patient as we were first timers. Looks clean, ordered to go but would be happy to dine in and stare at their huge wall of drinks. Happy to have found the place, will be going back for sure! Food the place on yelp so I'm just doing my part, good suggestion. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Freshly made buns. Great burgers, and dogs. Also any kind of soda under the sun. Literally. You have the choice of hundreds of brands from around the world."}
{"text":"This place is a little hole in the wall. Tucked in to a small strip behind Church's Chicken. Worth looking for! Juicy, flavorful burgers. Cheese curds were light and crispy. Just a little salty for my taste (and I like salty). But definitely good quality. They have a ridiculous selection of bottled sodas but I stuck with a fountain drink. Saw about 10 things in the menu I want to try so I will have to come back. Friendly staff, service with a genuine smile. Check it out, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Their rocket sauce is what makes their burgers delicious! I love supporting local businesses, I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best place to eat. I know I will die eventually because heart disease runs in my family but the chili dogs were so juicy with the red chili dripping off the sides. My wife is filing divorce papers this Tuesday so I decided to also get the old fashioned sodas. I had the cherry jolt cola that reminded of the time when I looked good and wasn't with my wife."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today after reading the Yelp reviews on burgers and I think it was even better than I had expected. The California burger was awesome and I loved the fries. To top it all off I had a Dublin Dr. Pepper to was it down.  Was the best burger shop hamburger I have had in years. 

The have a soda shop also where you can pick out gourmet sodas with a really big selection. 

Service was fast and very friendly. I will definitely be back again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"There is no real way to say this but........ROCKET BURGER IS ONE OF THE BEST BURGER PLACES IN AZ! Hands down the best burger there has to be the New Yorker! It has a patty, pastrami, cole slaw, and rocket sauce! I didn't even know a burger could be that good! The fries and onion rings are great too, i would not  call them the best but they are enjoyable! If you like to try different kinds of soda this is the place to go! They have any kind of bottled soda you can think of! Every time i have gone i have gotten a new soda i have never heard of before! The management there is great! A friend of mine got a bottled soda and didn't like it, they saw him about to throw it away and they said just to grab another soda free of charge! The workers there are really cool! I recommend this place to any one that is a burger lover! i live in Mesa and anytime i am out by Rocket Burger i will go out of my way to stop in! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"There is a big hype about this place, but...my gf and I ordered each of us a burger, after moving. Was looking forward to the delicious food. We watched a video review about them on \"Check Please, Arizona\" great reviews. Ugh. I would easily say I'm a foodie, and know what food should taste like. I got my \"burger\" the New Yorker, which was highly recommended by the show and by the cashier. The pastrami was fresh, their coleslaw was okay, the burger wasn't even cooked and it wasn't 
2 cm thick. And it was worse than a few fast food burgers. Ugh!! Then, when you walk into the place, it looks like a grocery store. Not real inviting. The wall of different soda pops was cool, but way over rated! I will never go back to this place. Not good enough food to retry! Sorry, just my opinion."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is second to none. Old fashioned bottled sodas that you've never heard of making choosing just one almost impossible. Once you decide on a burger you won't be disappointed regardless of your choice."}
{"text":"Pretty good, two single burgers a fry and a large drink came to 22$. Very casual place, they have a huge variety of different flavored bottled soda. The \"rocket sauce\" on the burgers was actually kinda gross. Tasted like horseradish mixed with thousand island sauce."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food is great and they have a tremendous selection of unique soft drinks."}
{"text":"Our first visit wasn't so good when we found a hair in my sons ranch followed by a bug in our Frys.  The two employees were apologetic and offered a free drink, but not enough to make us go back plus it was expensive an disappointing cheese curds"}
{"text":"This place is crazy good! The New Yorker and the chili burger were AMAZING! I come here all the time, they have this wall full of  unique soda that is pretty cool, fries are good until they get cold, onion rings are amazing and fresh, california burger is awesome too!! Great place!!"}
{"text":"It deserves 5 stars. All of my return visits have been amazing. You can get pastrami on your burger. Did you hear what I just said. Pastrami on the burger. I'm not joking here folks. Pastrami on the burger. An entirely different meet (Pastrami) on top of a completely seperate meat (hamburger).  I'm not sure it's the leanest cut of pastrami, in fact it's fatty as hell, but it is pastrami on the burger. Need I say more.
One more time....
Pastrami on the burger.
Ergo.... Five Stars."}
{"text":"This place is great! They have some of the best burgers in town. The guy who brought my food out wouldn't even let me get up to get my own ketchup. He said he could never let that happen even though the ketchup is at a self serve location."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town! Tha garlic melt is amazing! I love this place so much I've eaten there twice in the same day!"}
{"text":"Good value for the price. it was 10$ for a double california burger and fries. I thought the burger was pretty good (yes i went to phoenix from LA to have a california burger..).

Parking is a little tight since it has a shared lot."}
{"text":"Very Cool restaurant and a Must Try!!!  The Menu is out of this world with all different types of unique burgers topped with pastrami, a philly cheesesteak burger, one had a breaded and then deep fried green chili on it (Who does that :) MUST TRY!  Another burger experience I recommend trying, if feeling daring is the Gyro burger, this thing is about the size of 4 burgers in one and is topped with homemade tzatziki sauce.  Now for the endless soda pop flavors, whatever you can think of they pretty much have it.  I recommend trying the So Duh! Liquid Fire flavor, tastes just like you're sucking on an atomic fireball candy (Crazy, but fun).  Place looks a lil rough on the outside, but don't let that fool you as I recommend any  Burger Fanatic to try!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had.   The service was spectacular as well.  Very well trained and genuine staff."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! Service was just as fabulous, very kind and courteous staff. If you love different varieties of bottled soda, they have a great selection to choose from. We tried a cheeseburger, make your own sub & mini corn dogs. Everything was scrumptious, especially the corn dogs! Worth a visit (or ten+ visits!)."}
{"text":"I just saw this place as I was passing by to pick up my contacts. I was hungry and always up to try a new burger place. I'm glad I stopped. I got the Double Bacon Cheeseburger with a side of cheese curds. The cheese curds were amazing. The burger was one of the best I've had ever! I intend on being a regular here."}
{"text":"This Place is pretty cool. The Vintage sodas are Awesome and they have the Biggest selections of Sodas I have ever seen. The Cali Burger I got ways Tasty and Delish!! Found it by reading Yelp. Came up for conference from Tucson. Food and People are Great!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a regular New York sub online and was charged $7... what I got was half a sandwich with barely any meat... no sides or drink.  The sandwich was very good!  But i couldn't help but feel a little taken advantage of."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! I had the gyro burger and it was amazing. Tasted exactly like a gyro. My husband got the cheese fries and  needless to say that is a real cheese on the fries. He said his burger was the perfect ratio of burger to bun and Is one of the best burgers he's had. I consider him a burger connoisseur  as he is a  meat & potato kind of man.  Definitely worth the drive to come here.  Could not leave without a four pack of root beer to enjoy later."}
{"text":"I recommend getting anything they have on special, never disappointed. Everything is hand made, and fresh. I think they no longer make their own bread tho, which leads to me giving 4, rather than 5 stars. Love this place regardless"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh, my 2 favorite things when I'm trying a new restaurant. Friendly staff and we got our food pretty fast. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Burgers were great, service was great, cheese fries great, onion rings were great too. Burgers are probably better than 90% of the burger joints around here! Only item that was disappointing is the cheese curds, they weren't to good, might want to stay away from those."}
{"text":"2nd time here I ordered the turkey club! Amazing with veggies piled high and tons of meat!(accidentally deleted photo) I had a meal was about $12 which is a little more than I would pay for but it was worth it. I had fries with my meal, UH-mazing! I would definitely come back..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I had been meaning to come to Rocket Burger for a month or so..

The place makes you feel like a kid again with ridiculous amounts of flavored sodas from super rare brands. They even have Jolt....

So the places drink selection is off the charts..The burger and fries could have been a bit better..

Staff was friendly, however I was not asked how I wanted my burger cooked, granted it came out good.

But the special sauce they use I could have done without..and the fries were average.

All in all its a must try and a nice little experience."}
{"text":"We decided to try this location after our favorite burger place was closed for the day.  I had a chicken sandwich and my husband had a burger.  The flavor of the sandwich was good, but I was disappointed that they didn't tell me it was a fried chicken breast.  My husband didn't care for the size of the bun compared to the size of hte patty.  The atmosphere was fun and service was quick."}
{"text":"I ate here twice in this last week. I went there because I was wanting a good hot dog. I had searched yelp for a good place. I read the reviews and thought I would try it out. Plus it had been on check please. I actually got the chicken bites and fries both times. The chicken bites were crispy and had some taste. They tasted great and had a garlic taste. Best dipped in some ranch of course! I'm a French fries fanatic . These were just right and were homemade and fresh.  The second time my boyfriends 10 year old was with me and he got the Shirley temple drink in the bottle . He liked it so much I bought him a six pack to go. M They had the burgers and enjoyed the burger. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Beef hot dog grilled to perfection. Bun toasted just right. Hand cut fries with just the right amount of everything. Staff seems to like the customers as well as what they do! Extensive and delightfully surprising range of craft sodas. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I LOVE TO EAT... Every burger I get is rocket sized. Remember that when ordering. for you Juggalos... they have Faygo. Send yo momma!! fries are ok, onion rings is where its at, and the cheese curds are awesome. i sat there and ate a 12 patty rocket burger and rings. I'll never forget this; the cook came over to my table and the guy stands 6'2 and shakes my hand and says i am his hero. LOL! great food great guys."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers; I had the Eddie Lopez which has pastrami and my wife had the garlic mushroom. Tasty with fresh buns. But the star of the show are the onion rings which are the best I have ever had. They use a cornmeal batter. Flaky and tender with excellent flavor. The selection of bottled soda is amazing."}
{"text":"Terrific burgers, good service, and an awesome selection of bottled sodas.  This place is the bee's knees!"}
{"text":"Like food? Me too....Like great food?! Me too!

Rocket Burger is conveniently located 5 minutes from my house, and fits the budget like the 50 stars on our beautiful flag! 

In my opinion it's under priced, fresh food, great people, amazing cooks! But it all starts with a great owner. We got the opportunity to speak to the owner/head chef, and it explained the godly burgers that come from the kitchen. This place is great, innovative, and EASY on the bank account.

Santa Fe Burger, to die for..."}
{"text":"amazing burgers and sandwhichs and drinks here best hidden gem in az i highly recommend the garlic chicken burger just everything they have is made with high quality amazing taste just cant get another of it i want to try to come here at least once a. week and everyone should to!!"}
{"text":"Every year i travel to Phoenix to visit my family and this is the one place I make it a point to come and visit. Their burgers are delicious and the chili cheese fries are super scrumptious,  their soda selection is incredible never have i seen so many selections. Hopefully i can visit more often and visit this place as well."}
{"text":"Heard this place through the grapevine and was impressed. Greasiness, brioche buns, craft soda. The menu caught me off guard with its simplicity look (but many unique and staple choices) but the Rueburger and craft soda amazed me by far. Rueburger included not only the burger patty but grilled onions, sauerkraut, sauce and the pastrami and pickle. I'm not a soda person by any means but the craft soda paired well with the burger and even on its own. I kept sipping and sipping for more. There are a wide selection of soda to choose from so you won't be disappointed. Rocket Burger has launched in the right place and is worth it. I would love to come back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Sandwiches and subs not what I expected. The place is dirty.  All the tables were dirty. Fountain drinks were out of order."}
{"text":"Me and the hubby have been here twice now and everything was great! Service is very friendly, very mom and pop hamburger shop, very cool and great food!"}
{"text":"Best local burgers in town in taste and price. Top quality ingredients all cooked to perfection in combination with the variety of burger, hot dog options and drinks makes this place a must place to eat."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of sodas!!! I don't think I've ever seen so many in one place... the burger was very very tasty :D 

They were also accommodating with remaking a burger for my husband due to kosher restrictions."}
{"text":"Good food, fair prices.  If you are getting an order to go make sure you check your order before you leave.  They have forgotten to put things in my bag on 3 separate occasions.  Other then that I enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Very glad to have found this place. Great food. Everything was fresh and delicious. We drove 9 miles to get here to try it out and are very glad we did. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ok, here I go again.
 Rocket Burger ROCKS!!!! Great food....great owners.....great staff. Went in there yesterday, and walked out very content. Food is very very good.
And Ruth....No....I am not going back in today....I gotta work! LOL!"}
{"text":"How did I not know about this place?!!  Food is fantastic and a huge wall of vintage sodas with your meal??"}
{"text":"Excellent burger and chicken sandwich. Cute little place that has seating outside. The soda bar is awesome too! Root and Ginger Beer!! The cheese curds are good too!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are ok - not amazing, but good.  Toppings/varieties seem pretty average as well.  Nothing to write home about, but nothing negative either.

This place would get a solid 3-star review, but the soda selection gives it another star.  They have several refrigerated cases of soda by the bottle, different varieties from all over.  One entire case is just different kinds of root beer, including one I can hardly find out in AZ, \"Dang! That's good!\" butterscotch root beer.  This place is worth a visit for the soda selection alone."}
{"text":"We're back! Love this place! Try the Santa Fe burger. Hubby loves the Philly cheese steak. Lots and lots of sodas to choose from. Fried zucchini is yummy too!"}
{"text":"My husband I love coming to rocket burger. The afterburner chicken sandwich is so yummy! The service is fantastic & the sodas never let us down!"}
{"text":"We had high expectations for this place based on the reviews and I'm happy to say they delivered!. I was first of all so excited to see all the cream sodas..I'm seeing one after ages. I had the cali burger..this one i suppose is the spicy one..I'm loved it! The crispy bacon and avocado combination was lovely! My husband had the Sante fe burger and that went down quite quickly..the fried chilly was the highlight of that burger. Another point I must mention is the fact that the burgers arrived super quick.. this made me a very happy diner."}
{"text":"This place is great.  You really can't get much better.  They have unbelievable food at great prices.  I love the hole in the wall joints that make themselves big just because they're that good, they work hard, and they aim to please.
Anytime we've come in, the owners have been very nice, and the staff do their jobs.  The food comes out fresh and hot and I have never bitten into anything from there and said to myself, \"Self, this is not out of this world.\" Everything is above and beyond what you'd expect walking into this place.
My husband LOVES the New Yorker on the sub.  It is unreal.  The pastrami and coleslaw with the sauce... Heavenly.  The Rocket Burger is HUGE and uncomparable to the likes of culvers, in and out, ect.  My kids loved the corn dogs.
And to top off the ridiculously delicious food, you get your choice of 200+ kinds of bottled pop.  You will never feel like a penny was wasted after coming here.  So go."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch today before taking our boys to the water park. Rocket Burger is one of our favorite places to stop in to eat or just grab a couple of the MANY bottle sodas they sell. Upon walking in we immediately noticed they did a little re-model and moved the kitchen area back so it opens up the dining area a little. I also noticed it was a lot quieter & cooler inside. They also put a wall up that they are going to be selling some of their sodas by the 4 or 6 pack. My BF was excited to hear that so now we can stock up on some of his favorites at home. 
Like I said, we have been here many times but this time I tried the Afterburner Burger & OMG was it good! It had just the right amount of hot flavor but not too much to where you couldn't eat & enjoy it. He got a Bacon Rocket Burger that was good as well. We always get the chili cheese fries with the chili on the side & like always they were delicious! 
Don't be discouraged by the location or outside appearance of Rocket Burger, it's a small family business ran by nice people who serve good food!"}
{"text":"This review is a little late...I went here a few months ago and unfortunately can't go back cause I no longer am in Arizona so this review is based off my one and only experience. I normally like to give a place 2 trys before making any kind of judgement...... When I went it wasn't busy at all which is odd cause even after they saw me instead of welcoming me the guy behind the register screamed for his co-worker a few times before saying hi and what would I like. I looked over the menu and I can't remember what I ordered but know it was the garlic something and my wife ordered just a normal cheese burger. Both tables were dirty and had trash all over them which again there was nobody there so why were both tables dirty? The burgers weren't anything special in my opinion they weren't bad but weren't the best. The fries were easily my favorite thing about everything i wanna say they're cut and made when you order but I really don't know. They also have a amazing drink selection which I thought was really awesome. I would of loved to have gone a 2nd time to try something else but unfortunately never got to happen."}
{"text":"Great place to satisfy teenager's craving for burgers and fries, the staff was nice also."}
{"text":"Do not even consider another burger joint. This place is better than THE BOMB. The burgers, oh the burgers, are so delicious. The toppings are even on point like Stacy Adams. I had the New York burger. Unbelievable!!! It's topped with pastrami, coleslaw, and rocket sauce. The pastrami was easily way better than any deli has here in Phoenix and the coleslaw mixed with the rocket sauce which made the burger BEST IN PHOENIX. Hands down. And speaking of hands, the hand cut fries are so delicious. Near perfect. And the snozzberries taste like scnozzberries. Haha!! Yes, this place is also a Soda Shop!! Are you kidding me?!?! I was a 39 year old kid in a candy store with their amazing selection of bottled pop...yes pop...and fountain pop. I ended up with a Snozzberry fountain drink. You MUST try this. Thank me later. Beyond refreshing. Finally, the customer service was even better than the food and that is saying something. So don't even consider another choice. Get yourself to the intersection of 35th Ave and Cactus and devour Rocket Burger. I promise you will be a repeat customer. Well done and thank you Rocket Burger!!!! Customer now for life. Sincerely, Cory Pierce"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place based off of the reviews but in the end I was disappointed. It has a convenient store feel with a fast food place inside of it. The food was ok at best, but the soda/drink options is the only reason to go. There are over 315 soda options, they also have fountain drinks, juices, Powerade and bottled water as well. If I go back it will only be to get drinks because of all the unique drink options that you can't find most place."}
{"text":"Food is nice service is very poor. 
If in a hurry go someplace else. 
We would no go to this place again."}
{"text":"Great selection of bottled Soda. The hamburger was huge and delicious. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Awesome burger and they followed up on how we were doing, even though it is not your traditional sit down restaurant. I believe it was the owner who took the time to see how we liked it and to invite us back. I will say there is very limited seating, but other than that it's a great meal."}
{"text":"I love the variety of burgers, they are to die for , and they give you a yelp discount.The service is fast, and lots of drinks to choose from.I  went there one time on a friday, and some garage band was playing in the background. Not only did they suck, they were so loud, it was hard to even talk... Fortunately that has never happened again, or I swear, no matter how good the food I wouldn't go back....And I love rock a billy music."}
{"text":"I don't see what all the fuss is about this place wasn't all that great . I had the new York Burger it was pretty much Cole slaw, cheese, pastrami and the Patty but all I tasted was the bread it was a thick bun,  the Burger was tasteless and soggy from the Cole slaw and I just couldnt finish it.  Trash!"}
{"text":"I had the California burger it was ok 
It wasn't the best burger in the world but it was decent my son had the bacon cheeseburger rocket style which comes in a sub. He liked it the only thing we both agreed on was the rocket sauce is a little too sweet and makes the bread a little soggy. The fries were very good nice me crispy. The best part is the drink selection you have. You can get a bottle drink with ur meal which makes it an enjoyable experience. Overall good place not sure if we would come back for the burgers but for sure for some drinks"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of options to choose from. They are pretty expensive but the food is decent. I like the selection they have of drinks. They have like 50 different root beers from all over the world. I've been here 3 times and have been satisfied."}
{"text":"Beverage mecca. 

Rocket Burgers is a new addition to the NW side of Phoenix. It is tucked away behind Church's Chicken on the SW corner of 35th Ave and Cactus. I would have never seen it had it not been for Yelp. I'm not sure what was there before it but it is set up like a 7-11. It's nothing fancy but clean. It is decorated in red, white, and blue and has a painting of a rocket shooting over the desert on the far wall. A tribute to the Moon Valley Rockets down the street. There are a few booths and some tables and chairs. There is a convenient store size glass cooler on the largest wall. Inside contains just about any kind of drink you can think of. I'm talking every Gatorade invented and several sizes, bottle waters of every variety, Yoohoo, V8, Jarritos, Jolt, Coke products, Pepsi products, craft brewed root beers of about 20 different varieties, craft brewed ginger ales, crush in every flavor, any kind of juice you can think of, the list goes on. I'm not a big soda drinker and I wanted to try them all. I must have looked at all of them for about 10 minutes before making my decision. 

I ordered a chili cheese dog and onion rings. My wife ordered a single cheeseburger with fries. The guys/owners behind the counter are very cool. Anyone who wears a Fitz t-shirt deserves a shot at my business. My wife mentioned I had heard about them on Yelp and the gentleman was very happy to hear it. He smiled and said he had never heard of Yelp until recently and he has got a lot of business from it and its really working out well for them. 

So I settled on a Maine Root Beer that was gluten free and caffeine free and delicious. After about 5 minutes or so our order comes out. My wife's burger was very good. It had a huge round top bun and some very fresh veggies on it. The fries were homemade, thin and very fresh. The burger tasted great. It reminded me of Lenny's but with fresher toppings and a much higher quality bun. The chili dog had what appeared to be homemade chili on it. They put cheese slices and mustard on the bun first and then the National Hebrew huge dog and smothered it with chili then put more mustard and onions on the top. Just like I make it at home and it was very tasty. The bun was sesame seeded and toasted. The onion rings were battered lightly with corn meal. They were good and different. I'm really not a big fan of onion rings so I wasn't in love with them but that's not saying they weren't good. The amount of food was very generous. It was hard to finish it and I ended up giving up rather than over filling myself. 

I really enjoyed the beverage options these guys are serving up. The food wasn't out of this world but they did go the extra mile in everything they served. I appreciated that very much.  Another value was our huge meals with cool drinks came out to 12 bucks before a tip.  Plus they seem like they are a couple of great guys who started a business and who doesn't like to support that? We will definitely be going back to try out the subs and some other gourmet sodas."}
{"text":"YEOW, BABY!  I love this place.  I don't know how I got there the very first time, but I sure am glad I got there.  Went there tonight, and as always, was greeted like I was a long lost friend.  I love the smell of this place, as well as the taste of the food.  And I even stop there, sometimes, just for a bottle of red, cream soda.  I even ordered a root beer float, and there was so much ice cream in it, that I was miserable, when I left.  What can I say, I'm a glutton, when I eat, here.  Thank you, guys, for doing such a great job, with this little place.  I tell everyone about you."}
{"text":"I have no idea where to start on this review.. This place is just phenomenal.. Right when I walked in I knew i was at the right place, with all the sodas everywhere and the place was packed with people. When I looked at the menu I was lost because it had so many things. I saw the New Yorker Burger and I said this has to be amazing with some fries and a nice creme soda! I also added a side of mini corn dogs because who wouldn't???.. The girl helped me out also on if my choice was good and she said yes that's one of the popular items. She was nice and kept saying thank you. After I ordered I went to the fridges with all the sodas and I was literally lost.. I had no idea on what to get so many choices and so many things I didn't know about. I wanted to try one of everything to be honest. I grabbed creme soda and sat down. Waited about 5 minutes and the food came out, so the service was excellent too. The burger was fantastic the coleslaw with the pastrami that just melts into your mouth so juicy so good. The fries are seasoned so perfect not having a lot of salt like most seasonings. The corn dogs were as expected so amazing.. This place is just incredible and I can't wait to come back to try other things!! Just wish it had more room and not one bathroom.. But it's okay I like the old feel to it! If you want good food this is your place!"}
{"text":"Burger pretty good the actual hamburger itself nothing special but bun sauce and trimmings all really good."}
{"text":"Editing my review for this place. Originally gave them 4/5 stars after my first visit because you need to buy two of their hotdogs to fill up and now having gone there many times, I feel stupid for ever giving such a place only 4 stars when it clearly deserves 5. The hotdogs, while delicious, are the least interesting thing on the menu (although I recommend this place if you're in the mood for a gourmet hotdog). 

Their burgers however, are PHENOMENAL! In n' Out has NOTHING on this place (and I love In n' Out). There are a bunch to choose from, reasonably priced and so full of flavor they can only be described as MIND BLOWING. The fries are the best I've ever had as well, seasoned to perfection and cooked just right, just like their burgers. Definitely the best burger place I've ever been too in my entire life. 

Also, they have a gigantic wall full of designer soda's from all around the world, I believe they are only $2 a pop (no pun intended) or $1 upgrade onto a combo meal.

All in all, if you live in Phoenix you are blessed to be able to eat here on a regular basis, if you are passing through or here temporarily it is an experience you'll never forget."}
{"text":"What can't I say about this place? Extremely friendly staff, amazing selection of sodas both on tap and in bottles, and the burgers are something special too! I love burgers but my taste for them has evolved into something more defined as I've gotten older. Rocket Burger has an impressive menu with varying tastes where anyone can find something that suits them. I tried the New York and the Garlic burger. Wow. Those were extremely different and delicious! Made fresh to order and quicker than I thought it should take. The only drawback? It's in Phoenix and I live in Mesa... My poor gas tank. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"So I arrived at Rocket at noon totally in the mood for a greasy spoon type lunch and this place hit the mark.  I've passed by a number of times with the promise of the Latina Meat Market which never opened or closed before I had the chance to go in.
Anyhoo, I ordered a double cheeseburger with fries and a can of Diet Coke.  It took a little bit even though I was one of four patrons in the restaurant, but I'll accept that in that it means they cook your meal to order.  Good thin patty burger and thin natural cut fries, though the bun was a bit large.  I'm not a big exotic soda pop fan, but as previously noted if you are they've got probably 6-8 big coolers worth of everything from cream soda to energy drinks to regional colas.
The only issue I had with this place hit about 12:15 when a swarm of teenagers descended upon the restaurant and all of a sudden it's completely packed and noisy as all hell.  Guess the adjacent Moon Valley High isn't a closed campus..."}
{"text":"Get the garlic melt! It's amazing. The regular single is great too. The buttery buns really make the burgers."}
{"text":"Really cool Mom and Pop restaurant with the largest selection of refrigerated soda pop I've ever seen. They also serve up some very affordable and tasty food as well.

Inside is very simple with a rocket theme going on here and there. Outside looks pretty old and withered. Could have probably been a convenience store at one time or another. Parking lot is a bit small but achievable. Beep beep!

Ordered way too much food the first time and could barely finish it. They have Hot Dogs, Cheeseburgers, and a large selection of every type of Sandwich known to man. Very large portions. You can even choose Rocket size if you are feeling really hungry.

My favorite so far is going to be the NY Hot Dog which comes with Pastrami, Swiss, Coleslaw and Rocket sauce. Also have enjoyed the spicy Afterburner Chicken Sandwich, the Philly Burger, Mexican Dog, Chili Dog, and Chicago Dog.

Everything comes out fresh and ready to jam in your mouth. Their Fries and Onion Rings are also very delicious. Your meal is not complete without an Ice Cold Soda Pop from the cooler or a nice soothing Homemade Milkshake.

Place can get pretty busy during peak hours. They do have some additional seating next door. Great place to bring the kids and family. Be good and treat yourself to something fun. As Jackie Gleason used to say ... TO THE MOON!

{"text":"This review is based on a recent, first time visit to Rocket Burger.

Pros 
- Friendly Service
- Amazing Cola Selection
- Hole in the Wall vibe

Cons
- the Rocket Burger

On recommendation from the staff, I ordered their flagship burger the Rocket New York which is three patties on a 12 in sub with pastrami, cheese, and cole slaw. No fries (too much food already) and a root beer. I believe I paid about $14 bucks.

So the burger was huge and I was exited to get into it. However, I was disappointed with the quality of the meats. The pastrami was super salty and chewy, and I had to take it off the sandwitch after two bites. The burger meat was low grade, fatty, thin, and had an awful brown-granular texture too it. Fresh meat should have a reddish glow to it. This tasted it like was frozen, defrosted, cooked, refrozen, and reheated. The slaw was drown in mayo sauce. The bread was the best part. Nice sub roll with just enough crust on it. I eat half and had to stop. Not because I was full, but because I was getting an ulcer. I took the other half to go, and toss it. Felt bad tossing it in the store because the staff was friendly. 

I will most likely return because of the service and potiental I saw on the menu. Get a single or double burger, on a roll, simple toppings, and a fancy root beer. Hopefully it will be better and I can update this review to a 5!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, not great but I loved that they had so many different types of bottled soda. Would come back, if not for just a soda!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of custom burgers made to order .. Been here many times .. The one thing you'll definitely come back for aside from the eats is the soda selection... Any flavor soda you can think of .. They have ... From root beer  cream to cherry to bacon maple and banana .. The mushrooms are phenomenal as well and again made to order.. Piping hot .. My favorite burger is the afterburner single.. Altogether for one person with a bottled soda base price is about 10$ as a combination ( ie fries, mushrooms etc) so I'd give this place 5 stars .."}
{"text":"The wall of soda is damn impressive. and so are the burgers, but they are only 1/3 pound each. Still. obviously you can get a double, but actually the smaller weight almost guarantees that they make the burger well done. The bun was nice and squishy and fresh toppings were included along with the secret thousand island sauce which turned out to add a good flavor to the food. Of course, the highlight is the soda factory and if you get the combo, make sure to add 2 more bucks to have it include one of the beverages in the case. I ended up going radical with the pumpkin pie soda and yes it did taste like a lighter version of the pie and it was all natural as well. Fries were pretty addicting too."}
{"text":"Lemme tell y'all something right now.  Check my profile.  Yelp Elite 10, Yelp Elite 11.  What this means to you is, I aint no bitch.  I eat good food mother fackers.  GOOD FOOD.  Rocket Burger did not disappoint.

I've got 2 words for you.  Rocket sauce.  I'm not going to act like I know whats in, I do not.  I do know that Rocket sauce rocks the body that rocks the party.  I dont even care whats in it.  I only know that it is good and thats all I need.

I was extremely disappointed to find they had no Dublin DeePee.  Which is a staple in any specialty soda shop.  Too many rules and restrictions it seems.  

Its pretty easy to make an average burger but something completely different to make a great one.

ROCKET BURGER MAKES A GREAT BURGER.

I put my 2, count them 2, Yelp Elite Badges on the line here and declare that the In and Outs and 5 Guys of the world better watch their back.  Its obvious the guys running rocket burger are developing a rabid following by just being cool dudes serving high level food.

NONE CAN DEFEND!


ps This review is pretty much a 5 star.  I've just started being more stingy with my Stars."}
{"text":"So is this a burger sandwich shop or a fantastic specialty soda / pop store? This place is SO COOL!  I honestly never knew there were so many kinds of soda pop and the flavors are just as cool as the design and names on some of the bottles.

Anyway I can't express enough how impressed I was witht their soda selection but my reviews are more about a restaurant and their food and this review will not become an exception.

I ordered three burgers to go. Two double cheeseburgers a chili burger two orders of fries and one order of onion rings. My 21 year old grandson had their chili burger and an order of fries. My wife and I had the double cheeseburger. She had the fries I had the onion rings.

My grandson said he liked his burger and that it was OK but nothing to write home about. He said the fries were about the same.

My wife commented that her cheeseburger was a little spicy and ate half of it because she just didn't care for it.  Her fries were OK.

My first impression was this: Right from my first bite there was something about the burger I didn't like. It tatsed OK, Their sauce is great but it does have a bit of a kick to it.  so what was it? I finally determined that the combination of their \"sauce\" and the way their lettuce is cut so thin it appeared there was coleslaw on the sandwich instead of lettuce. In fact if there wasn't it sure seemed like there was and I just didn't care for it at all. But everything else about the burger was fine.  The burger was good, the bun was different than you normally get a burger on, it tasted good and was hot. I agreed with my grandson though it was noting to write home about. My wife and grandson also commented on how they weren't really impressed with their fries, but I have to say my onion rings were deeeeeelicious!!! 

Bottom line: Better than Rocket Burger is better than any fast food place. I guess I just expected a little more especially after reading the reviews. 

                   So I will have to give them another try 

FOOD: NO wow factor or anything, however they are  better than any fast food place. PRICE: The prices are reasonable. SERVICE: The guy at the counter was nice and polite. AMBIENCE:  Looked more like a convenient store than a restaurant. CONCLUSION: Two Words: SODA SHOP The selection is intense. Best I've seen in years. Great selection of small batch brews. I love mom & pop establishments so stop by and support this really friendly neighborhood shop."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Rocket Burger! Dont forget to add a scoop of ice cream to make anyone of those amazing sodas a FLOAT! There chicken tender bites are to die for."}
{"text":"I heard about this place by watching Check Please. We finally got to get there, today.
It's such a cute little place. Almost, back in time. I would not have guessed that there is that many flavors of sodas made, much less sold in one place. If you aren't into bottled soda they have a soda fountain.  I ordered the single Cali burger, it had bacon, avocado cheese and the usually fixings. It was good but way too greasy for my stomach to consume. The onion rings were so-so.  Greasy and a little over fried. The service was exceptional. The gals were so friendly. I wouldn't return, but I think one should give it a try, maybe your stomach is stronger than mine!"}
{"text":"Rocket Burger is surely one of the best burger restaurants in Phoenix! The restaurant was small and quaint, it offered an extensive selection of burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, sodas and much more! The walls were lined with quirky bottles of craft soda, sure to please any taste. On a Saturday afternoon, we experienced both friendly and fast service. As for the food... it was astronomically tasty! One of the most delicious and unique burgers was the Gyro burger, which unfortunately, we weren't able to photograph because it was eaten so fast! The burgers were topped with a mouth-watering rocket sauce and the fries were seasoned to perfection! We will definitely be back because coming to Rocket Burger was a blast! Our new favorite burger place!!! It will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great friendly staff, TONS of soda to choose from (about 300 at this location and about 5000 at the other location.  I'm told) I think I spent more time deciding my drink than my burger.  I got the California Burger single as is and a Black Cherry Cream.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great service. Menu is huge. Got a bacon cheeseburger single. Definitely recommend getting onion rings. Best I've ever had. French fries reminded me of what my dad would make when I was a kid. Even the brownie was delicious. Just all around great place to eat."}
{"text":"Buzzing place at lunch on Friday. The burgers are perfectly seasoned, nice glazed bun. The New York burger had a great combination of slaw with the burger and bacon. The avocado addled freshness to my burger. The thin fries were nicely seasoned. Tip: Yelp check-in is 10 percent off your whole order."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Awesome place. Best selection of drinks ever. Great subs, and kind workers. Don't let the exterior scare you off, great place to eat."}
{"text":"Don't miss this place!!! My wife and I tried this place the other night and Im so glad we did. The burgers taste amazing and the chili cheese fries are to die for. The guys who run this place honestly care about their customers and want to make sure you leave absolutely happy. Prices are great and the food is even better. LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly pretty damn good. Nice bun on the burger, well cooked and seasoned....a trained chef or someone with attention to detail has got some knife skills on the veggie prep.

Had mex burger and onion rings....big portions. I liked that the onion rings came with ranch....finally someone who knows what the customer will request ahead of time.

Their cold case of a million sodas and drink options is cool...next time I will investigate.

Two thumbs up for sure."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my husband and mother-in-law. My husband had the garlic burger and my mother-in-law had the chili burger. I had the Mexican burger no bun because I am GF. At this time the do not offer GF buns instead they put my on a bed of lettuce. We also had their fries and onion rings. Even though I am GF I tried the onion rings. They are very good. They batter the onion rings there. Everyone was satisfied with their selection. I think I would have liked mine better with a bun. The girl behind the counter was very friendly and polite. The place is small inside but there are picnic tables outside so it is a good place to go while the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Decent burgers, but messy. The soda selection is interesting. Huge wall of antique sodas."}
{"text":"delicious burgers!  I was visiting from San Diego and found this place near my sis's house. The sandwiches, burgers, and fries were all a hit with the family. Oh, and don't forget to add an order of fried cheese curds!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed. Went to Paradise Valley Burger yesterday and this definitely compares. The price is very right, was 1/2 the cost of PVB and I think the quality of beef was on par. I really enjoyed the fries too. This is a really good classic burger."}
{"text":"The place was okay. My expectations might have been a little too high because of all the awesome reviews, but I know that I won't be coming back here again. There's very limited seating (which is fine because you can just get your food to go), but it can definitely get hot if you're just sitting outside in the sun. Anyhow, this really wasn't a big deal. I came here for the burgers, and I was fine hanging next to a few flies outside. 

We waited about 20 minutes to get our food, and the place wasn't even really packed. They initially gave our food to someone else - I get that accidents happen, but there's a reason that each customer is given a number for their to be delivered, right? They even asked if we'd be okay taking the food that they set in front of the other people. Yeah, I don't want to eat food that someone else was just touching. The burgers themselves were fine, but nothing to really write home about. I had a bacon burger, and it was pretty good. Their fries aren't the best, but their onion rings were probably the best part of everything.

Their prices are decent and they do have a nice selection of craft sodas. I might have been salty about the whole experience because of the whole food mix-up, but either way, I probably wouldn't recommend this place unless you're already in the area and looking to try something new."}
{"text":"I came here one day with my father and the first thing I loved was the massive variety of sodas. I spent a good 10 minutes looking at them all. I ordered a burger which was alright. My father said his was ok as well. It was not anything to talk about afterwards. The service was average but not bad. I'll be back to give this place another chance. We all have off days."}
{"text":"This place pretty much rocks! Our friends introduced us to the place last night. Our experience was so exciting that we went again today for lunch. The first meal was a philly burger, amazing, and a gyro burger, an another amazing! Both burgers were spot on with big flavor! The burgers are great, but the other thing that made the place pop for me was the selection of artisan sodas. The place has a giant selection of sodas that are so rare to find. I'm from Maine and they had Moxie. I can't get Moxie soda anywhere here in the valley, that is except at Rocket Burger! This review isn't for the soda Moxie, it is definitely an acquired taste. Rocket Burger on the other hand is not a place that has to grow on you. You'll fall in love with it right away."}
{"text":"Awesome!!Came in the other week for the first time in about a year. Had no clue what to order but the super friendly cashier (jesse I think) gave me a a run down of the full menu by memory. I was impressed and also very pleased with this customer service. He helped me decide what I wanted and ordered my food very well. I got a ghost burger and I pick a random drink from their huge wall of choices. My meal and entire experience was awesome and I'm very happy to have visited this restaurant."}
{"text":"Me and my friends from GCU come here all the time. It's our favorite burger joint. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Cute concept place with a huge selection of sodas. I ordered my lunch for pick up today. Cheeseburger with decent amount of fries. Both were very good and reasonably priced. Will be back for sure. Oh, and thanks for the 10% check-in coupon, Yelp! 

Next time, I'll be trying something else, like the New Yorker, which looks and sounds amazing. May add the ghost pepper cheese too ;)"}
{"text":"Eh, I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and fried zucchini combo. It was just over $12, good amount of food for the price. The chicken was pretty big and I got plenty of fried zucchini. The chicken breading was a bit salty and slightly over cooked which made the edges just taste burnt. The zucchini was good but super hot when I bit into it, doi  I'm disappointed because I read such good reviews on the place, but overall for the price and quality I probably won't return. Also the owner asked most of the customers how they heard about the place and if it was their first time there but he never said anything to me so that was a bit of a kicker, nbd just tops the experience."}
{"text":"Small restaurant, super friendly, fresh ingredients, amazing food all for a fair price. What more could you ask for? Five stars, will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Service outstanding all around, just great people working there.  Many solid options.  Been a few times, burgers fresh. Buns are a bit dry and too much bread, not my taste. Best chili cheese dogs and fries in town I've had. Enjoy the incredible amount of soda options, although I'm not a huge soda guy.  Old school burger booths.  Good humble spot."}
{"text":"Went to this place with some friends and really enjoyed it.  They have a pretty good menu. It's fun to see the combination of a burger and subs place. There is an old school vib in the place.One of the first things I noticed was the craft sodas. I went straight for the root beer! Then I tried the black cherry. This place gets high marks for the craft sodas. My friends and I all loved the burgers and fries as well.

There employee were very helpful. They helped me out with the menu and answered all of the questions I had. The menu has a good selection of items and it was my first time. I liked that the restaurant was clean and well maintained.

This is a great place and I recommend people to come and check it out. Great food, good menu and awesome crafted soda."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome old school place. Soda selection is massive and simply delicious hand crafted food. You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"First time here, tried their philly burger... omg! Talk about amazing flavor, fresh meat, fries and zucchini were bomb!!!! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, fantastic experience.  I finished my double bacon burger faster than my son finished half his single - and I usually eat sensibly.  Furthermore, they have a VAST selection of sodas that are unique.  Price was decent, and the people were very friendly and helpful.  I will be looking for an excuse to go visit them again, VERY soon!"}
{"text":"Always a great spot to grab lunch. Never disappointed! I love the Mexican dog . And when you see all of the bottles of soda you will be amazed. So come and check this place out."}
{"text":"I went here with a buddy for lunch and was pretty satisfied with my experience.  It's not fancy or much to look at, but they definitely focus on the food, and that's all one can ask for.  The Philly Cheesesteak was great and so was the extensive selection of sodas.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area and looking for something quick and cheap."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is very well portioned, and yummy.  I really love the endless selection of bottled drinks offered.  Must try if your craving a soda different from the normal selections offered.  But, they do have the standby soda selections available as well.  Stop in, burgers have some crazy combinations to try."}
{"text":"I have been in so many times since the time of my initial review that I had to write an update. It has been awesome every time. The fries, still deep fried awesomeness!

There soda selection is always growing and if you get a chance you have to try; The Flying Cauldron \"non-alcoholic\" Butterscotch Beer.. If you tell other people that you 'like' butterscotch so they don't think you're weird, this is your dream soda. Whenever I go I buy two because the 1st one I inhale and the 2nd one I actually drink slow enough to enjoy..;-)

I realize that I have never mentioned the service which has always been the \"no-brainer\" part of deciding if I want to eat at Rocket Burger. There are those places you love to eat, but wish you could get someone to go get it for you \"You know 'cause the food's great but..\" and the 'but' is not wanting to have to actually go there. 

This is not one of those places..I swear on my bones. :-)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to get a great burger, this is that place.The burgers, fries, and customer service was excellent. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Just had their latest creation - the chicken tender bites salad. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-ZBfr1BHvArFp1d6XH8jOQ?select=VQg07pVUi7ZiSTao92KkRg  It was mega-flavorful! I love that this is not a chain eatery; it frees them to be creative, so they keep coming up with delightful new things to offer."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. Was skeptical but once I tried the food I was hooked. Back for the second tome
In 2 weeks. Worth the drive. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered their Fuego Pollo Burger! I found this place on Yelp and I recommend dine in orders as we ordered to go and by the time we got back to our hotel room my food was at food temperature but still delicious!"}
{"text":"Messy, delicious burgers.  Go for the double.  The single is probably fine, but it's only a little bit more for the double.  They do triples as well, but only go there if you want to embarrass yourself.  The double makes for a nice two-handed burger.  They have a bunch of choices.  When my Mr. and I hit up this joint a few days ago we tried the gyro double burger and the ol reliable, bacon double cheeseburger.  I ordered the fries because the pictures looked delicious, and he ordered the o rings.  Everything was fantastic.  The onion rings are interesting with what tastes like corn meal mixed in the breading.  They had a nice crunch and were not greasy.

Loved both of the burgers.  They gyro burger was a bit of a monster because we got a double and it has gryo meat on top of it too, but we managed to take most of it down.  I ate the rest of it at 3 in the morning.  Still great.  We had them load the burgers up with all the toppings and everything was fresh and provided a nice mix of flavors.  The seasoned fries are even better than they look in the pictures.

It was fun to choose a soda from the dozens of choices they have.  I haven't had a grape soda in years and I think I was on a sugar high for most of the afternoon.  They also have sandwiches, mini corn dogs, fried zucchini, hot dogs, and a few other of my favorite things.  This place is tucked back on the north side of Chandler Blvd in the strip mall attached to Safelite.   The employees were friendly and patient, and the prices were reasonable.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very nice burger selection (toppings not patty type), I've been here several time for lunch and enjoyed it every time.  Huge selection of soda, more then I have ever seen.  If you don't want a burger try the buffalo Chicken and the fried mushrooms...very good.  Beware, this is not a light meal, better for the younger crowd."}
{"text":"I had gone once before and didn't like my burger because it was all soggy and falling apart, gave this place a second chance and we'll the burger was pretty bomb and cream sodas are a must try, take the fam you'll all enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Burgers are great and you get a ridiculous amount of food with your combo meal! Plus you can't beat the selection of old fashioned sodas they have! A little hole in the wall but the place is very clean and the staff is always friendly. Burgers are to die for!! Definitely give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Pretty good change form the usual. Will come again. Great Zucchini onion rings NY Burger."}
{"text":"I'm from California and this place reminds me so much of La like the cheeseburgers are just like La! Hard to find a place like this in Az !"}
{"text":"This is an easy to miss/pass up local...which I stopped to check out a few years ago and am so glad I did. It is locally owned and operated. They have a standard menu and a rotated special.  The most obvious thing they sport is the vast selection of boutique sodas.

The food is fresh, ex, the fish is hand battered--in their own kitchen. The buns are very good, solid enough to hold up under all the marvelous stuff they put in their burger/sandwiches but soft with a nice bite/texture.

Back to the sodas...I think that it would be a very fun thing for a group of friends to gather and have a soda tasting event. It could event be a MeetUp. I do not want to even start listing the selection--just visit and take a look for yourself.

Finally, I have always been served by the same pleasant gentleman all the years I've been going there. Consistency, is something I value."}
{"text":"I love the soda selection, I love the tie in to the Moon Valley Rockets  referencing the nearby high school.  Clubs, burgers, sandwiches, salads, all have been fantastic.  I don't drink soda, but it's fun seeing so many options, it's like a living soda museum!  It's worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Saw this place on 'Check Please Arizona' and what a delight it is!  Just a hole in the wall with the best burgers and fries you could hope for. The bottle sodas is unbelievable,something for everyone. If your looking for fancy place,stay away. If your looking for great food and all around fun --this is the place for you"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. You would not notice it from the outside. But if you give it a chance, you will be impressed by the burgers this place create. The place looks like a convenient store, but much nicer. It has a huge wall of refrigerated soda of all kinds, in glass bottles. I haven't checked, but I wouldn't doubt if someone said that they have every flavor of soda known to man. 

Couple of suggestions: I would order double patty burgers. The patties are a bit thin, so the single patty burgers tend to be cold due to the vegetables on top. Also, I would break out of the norm and order a burger out of the ordinary cheeseburger. They have some great \"out of the box\" burgers. This place is worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"Much like Google search words, Hot, Spicy, Jalapeño, Habanero, \"Don't do it\", on a menu make me salivate like Pavlov's dog.  Most of the time I'm mildly amused or deeply unsatisfied with the level of heat and flavor from whatever it is I've ordered.

Enter the Afterburner burger from Rocket Burger.  Pepper jack cheese, horseradish mayo, fresh jalapenos, rocket relish, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onions.  Your stomach, not you, should be required to sign off on this before consumption begins.  The horseradish mayo was atomic horseradish, I know because I use it in my cocktail sauce at home.  This is not for young children or those that eat like them.  As powerful as the burger was, it wasn't that memorable or something I would want to go back for.  The bun was a little oversized for a single burger, I think they must sell a lot of doubles or bigger so the buns are probably completely right-sized for those, but both me and The Princess thought the buns were a little large.  The P had a basic burger, no cheese,  just tomato, mustard, catsup and she thought the burger was passable.  She loved the fries, I thought they were ok.

As it's been well documented on Yelp, the soda collection is legendary, you name it or want a certain flavor of soda, it's probably there, cold and ready to enjoy.  It's most likely the largest collection of bottle soda pop in the state.


This is my second time here and I feel like I'm missing something for a joint that has 4.5 stars.  I'd much rather enjoy a great burger from Lenny's or Five Guys (the Five Guys little burger with everything and jalapenos is one of my all-time favorite burgers).  I'll come back one last time and try a dog (thanks for the tip Mark R!).

Until then, a solid three stars."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, great service as well. Unfortunately the gyro rocket burger just wasn't very good, the bun too small and the gyro meat tasted very processed. I did enjoy the recommended root beer though! The fries are also pretty good. All in all; I think their prices are too high ($11 specialty rocket burger w/o side), but for somebody that appreciates rare sodas this is a good spot."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  ended up here after searching yelp for a good burger place and rocket burger came right up! The service was quick and friendly and the food was hot and fresh and absolutely delicious!! Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good neighborhood burger joint?  I will emphasize the \"good\" and \"joint\" on this one because chances are even this little hole-in-the-wall will surprise you.

I had seen the great reviews on Yelp as well as the Phoenix New Times about this place, so I decided to take a chance on grabbing lunch here on a Friday.  I was a little apprehensive about coming just because of the proximity to Moon Valley High School (it's literally next door).  Lunch + Friday + high school conjures up images of when I and hoards of classmates used to go to our favorite lunch spots with friends during high school.  Worse yet, the place is in a tiny old strip mall with almost no parking.

Shockingly, the place wasn't busy at all and I easily got a parking spot.  When you walk in you almost feel like you've stumbled upon an old convenience store as you immediately notice the soda machines, the large refrigerator area full of soda, and even the soda six packs on the shelves.  Notice a theme here?  Yeah, they've got A LOT of soda.  In fact they claim to have the widest variety of sodas to choose from in the state.  As in the entire state of Arizona!  I have no way of verifying this claim, but I did indeed see many soda brands and flavors I had never seen before from chocolate to watermelon, to lemon, and on and on.  If you're a soda junkie, you'll be in heaven here.

But I came for one reason, the burgers.  They actually have a variety of hot dogs, gyros, and submarine sandwiches as well, but its Rocket \"Burger\".  I saw one person eating a Rocket sized burger which is insanely huge (basically a submarine burger sandwich with at least 4 patties by my count).  I wasn't feeling that bold so I went with a bacon double cheeseburger instead and got a side of fries.  The burger was excellent.  Hearty portion with plenty of cheese and bacon and their special sauce (basically a rendition of thousand island from what I could tell).  The fries were pretty average so nothing special there.  All totaled, the burger, fries and a drink were $8.  The dining area is pretty small with tables, chairs and a couple of booth.  But like I said, it wasn't crowded and I was easily able to get a seat.  I was in and out in about 20 minutes

Overall, a pretty cool place and certainly unique to the west side of town.  The fries were really the only big negative of this place.  Burger was great, prices are right, and the soda selection will blow your mind."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, great variety. You pay sit-down prices for fast-casual service, but the food is so good and the portions are generous; it's still a value! I literally have not tried anything on the menu I haven't liked. The soda selection is awesome, from crafts on drafts to rare bottles, and the staff is friendly. Great hole in the wall place."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place when my coworkers told me about it, but when I walked in for the first time and saw the wall of bottled sodas, I changed my mind.  They didn't even mention that!

Seriously, though, they have a lot of sodas.  A whole refrigerator full of root beers.  A row of birch beers, a couple rows of colas, a row of Faygo sodas, a couple rows of ginger ales/beers... Really, every soda you can think of besides spruce beer (I guess I'll still have to go to California to stock up on spruce beer).

Of course, this is also a burger place.  The burgers are fantastic, as long as you're not expecting a gourmet, 95% lean, thick patty $12 burger.  It is better than the Five Guys and Smashburgers of the world.

Try the New York burger (Pastrami, slaw, rocket sauce), the Santa Fe burger (bacon, fried green chili, rocket sauce), or the Baja burger (pico de gallo, bacon, rocket sauce I think).  Those are my personal favorites.

I have also had the gyro burger - pass on that one; the tzatziki sauce is great, but the gyro meat is probably the frozen variety.  They don't specialize in gyros here.

I pay this place a visit every week now.  The fact that their A/C doesn't seem to work well in the summer doesn't even dissuade me.

My biggest complaint is that they have a soda fountain.  People who prefer carbonated sugar water over delicious specialty sodas are simply not worthy - they're casting their pearls before swine."}
{"text":"This was a fun place to try.  Our kids ordered off the pretty typical kids menu, but I absolutely loved the afterburner burger!  My husband and I got it rocket style and split it. That's on a large hoagie roll with three or four hamburger patties spread across it. The horseradish mayo was fantastic and all the ingredients were very fresh including fresh jalapeños. After eating there we went next door to The Pop Shop, which they also own, and bought some unique sodas to take home. Overall, great food and a fun experience!"}
{"text":"I was craving a good burger but didn't want to get a $14 one. I found this gem on Yelp and went with my husband on a Saturday night. There were a couple people in the small restaurant. You walk up and order. We did the cheeseburger and double bacon burger. Both were great! I loved the big bun that was grilled and had just enough of their rocket sauce. We split cheese fries which were cut fresh that day with melted real cheese. We dipped them in a side of ranch which they didn't charge us for and they were amazing and plenty to share. Also if you want to try a fun soda this is the place!"}
{"text":"Glad my kiddos and I found this spot! Spontaneous cravings for a tasty burger and this place did not disappoint! My boys love the not so heavy buns and perfect size of burger. I, on the other hand devoured the amazing Eddie Lopez Burger and all I can say is that I am a happy camper! Highly recommend this spot for the variety of burgers on the menu and alternative choices as well. Come check out the huge selection of bottled soft drinks as well! Definitely guaranteed to satisfy your eclectic tastes especially if you're a Rootbeer fan!"}
{"text":"I had the Cali Burger on the owners recommendation and it was GREAT!  I didn't love the skinny fries, but the burger more than made up for it. Excellent soda selection, fast service and very filling. The place was full but didn't feel busy."}
{"text":"Definitely not somewhere to go if you are looking to eat healthy!  But it was so good!  I ordered the chicken teriyaki sandwich-and although it looked difficult to eat, I scarfed it down without a problem and without a mess!  Have some fun and try to find the craziest sodas amongst their giant selection!"}
{"text":"A '94 Rocket myself, I heard a good buzz about this place from folks in the old 'hood.  I brought my two little burger critics with me as well (ages 10 and 12).  Lots of soda to choose from, great hamburgers, and delicious fries.  It beats the heck out of a chain burger place in quality and character.  I even ordered the \"Rocket Burger\" which is a ridiculous three-patty monstrosity on a 10-inch sub roll.  I was embarrassed in front of my kids because I couldn't even finish my fries.  Rocket Burger has the makings to be a classic joint, legendary if they can match Capin' Bills longevity!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best burger joint in town! All bottled soda you could ever dream of, in fact the largest selection in Phoenix I believe. Portion sizes are great too! I would recommend everything on the menu as I have tried most of it."}
{"text":"Prices are good but burgers were not by the time we got home buns were soggy I didn't like their sauce they put in the burger. We ordered a burger with double meat one just regular and ended up with both just regular. The only thing I liked was their drinks."}
{"text":"They have a HUGE choice of all kinds of bottled sodas and delicious homemade chili sauce. Their rocket sauce is outta this world and the shakes are bomb too. Definitely come here!"}
{"text":"Let me say this clearly and succinctly, Rocket Burger is simply the best!

Sitting at home, convalescing from a neck operation, I noticed Karen W, Joyce W and Kate M reviews, that Rocket Burger had a new Chandler outpost. Well I hit the BM'd (Bookmark in Yelp-speak) and made a note to come here when I returned to work. Done!

This past Friday, I ordered their delicious Double Burger & Pastrami (see photo) sandwich, only $7.49. Look at the receipt and look at those pictures, it doesn't get any better. And for all my Chicago relatives and friends, yes they carry Berghoff's Root Beer.  Nice!

I was introduced to Rocket Burger nearly seven years ago by King Scott D when he invited me to lunch.  I had the Philly Burger that day and have since made several trips on my own. Thank you, Scott D!

One of the most cool and impressive things about Rocket Burger is their assortment of soft drinks bottles in the refrigerated case behind where you sit. They have Dad's Cream Soda, Grape Nehi, Green River, Royal Crown and yes the afore mentioned Berghoff Root Beer

In his review of Rocket Burger's other location, my friends Arlin B writes: \"It was a mouth watering double burger that came with Hot Pastrami stacked on top of the two patties covered in melty-cheesy goodness, toppings and their thousand island dressing.  It was FANTASTIC!!\"  Like d'ah, I agree. LOL

The only down side here is their limited seating, they have only three inside booths and two more outside. When I was here, I doubled up with a guy from Little Rock, AR who now works in Gilbert.  His friend told him he had to make the trek and come here. 

I agree, why are you wasting your time reading this review.  Get in your car already!

Enjoy"}
{"text":"It may not be health food but it sure is tasty! The burgers are yummy and the fries are plentiful but the best part of this place is the soda selection. There is a whole wall of bottled sodas from classics to crazy. We always try 4 or 6 different ones when we go.

I always get the teriyaki chicken sandwich. It is incredibly messy but so good. I usually go through 10 or 12 napkins trying to finish it. My husband has tried many of the burgers and said they are all great. Be warned, the servings are huge so you will leave full.

Seating it limited in this small place, as is parking, so we try in go in off hours so we don't have to wait for a table after we place our order at the counter."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my Italian sub so much while visiting AZ for the first time that we went back for lunch back-to-back days instead of trying out other places! Highlight of my trip."}
{"text":"Try the teriyaki burger! The fried pineapple sends it over the top. All those flavors work so well together.

Today I had the New Yorker sandwich on marbled rye. Oh my! That is not a good sandwich, that is a great sandwich!

If you have a favorite soda from your home town that you can't find here in town, you will be able to find it here at Rocket Burgers.

I love this place! It's two guys living out their dream. They get to know their customers and they cook for you as if you're family."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE Rocket Burger as you will tell from our review on the original location.  Just the best burger in the valley!!  The owner is a rock star too.  Definitely check them out."}
{"text":"Items Ordered:  Double Bacon Cheeseburger; Crispy Fish Sandwich w/Coleslaw; Pick 2 sides

Total Bill:  Under $25

Quick Tips:
     - Take a look at the soda wall before you order...there are hundreds of choices.
     -  Buy yourself a four pack of soda when you leave.  They have a separate soda shop next to the restaurant.

Ok so this is our place for burgers and we drive all the way from the East Valley to get them.  Hands down, the best.  And not only the burgers.  We have had the hot dogs = great; the crispy fish = delicious; and the pastrami w/ coleslaw = AMAZING!  Everything they fry is awesome.  

The one thing I would say could be improved is the onion rings.  The batter is not very thick and tends too be very crumbly when eating.  Still tastey though!

And the owners/cooks are awesome!  Always have a friendly word to share."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was nice. It was a bit out of our way but worth the small deviated drive"}
{"text":"The burgers were very fresh and tasty. I had the bacon cheeseburger, it was the perfect tonic after a very stressful week. We also loved the cheese curds and the multiple options for drinks. Being a water drinker, I had water in a box. Service was friendly and prompt. My husband didn't enjoy the sandwich as much as the burger."}
{"text":"No fancy schmancy interior.
Just clean and cost effective.
Best cheese curds I've had in Phoenix.
Not fast food style with homemade breading, not frozen varieties like others.
Had a hot dog as well. 
Not a big fan of their sauerkraut, but I am picky being Polish and German. 
Good dog and a good bun. 
Staff was friendly too.
I will definitely be back for my cheese curds and dog fix...and to try a burger."}
{"text":"So many options to choose from. So many drinks, burgers and sandwiches. Can't remember what I ordered I just remember being full and totally satisfied."}
{"text":"We ordered the steak burger, Reuburger, Little ones had kids meals.   We also ordered take out at the same time and they were kind enough not to start until we were closen to leaving so it would be hot and fresh.  Everyone was beyond super nice, food was great.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We had the Santa Fe burger that included a fried green chile pepper, it was good but not hot.  My son had a regular hamburger and loved it.  I think next time we might not get the Rocket sauce bc it was a little sweet.  There are tons of bottles of soda and the fountain soda is delicious, had Snozzberry so good!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good hamburger so reviewed Yelp and saw Rocket Burger. Went in on Saturday and I see why they get the great reviews. Great fresh burger and good bun. Service was great as I was asked twice by whom I assume was owner or manager how food was and if I needed anything else. My wife and I loved this place and will be back next weekend."}
{"text":"In 1 word, TREMENDOUS!! Delicious medium well juicy burger with crispy bacon, griilled onions & grilled mushrooms and garlic mayo. Absolute HEAVEN baby.  Topped it off with a Banana soda. Servers were polite and efficient. Clean restrooms. Do yourself a favor and ride the ROCKET  to taste bud HEAVEN."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great. The other day I was driving and saw a man spinning a sign advertising Rocket Burger so I looked it up. Based on the reviews, I decided to give it a try. It was a GREAT decision. After the very friendly cashier gave us the run down, I decided to order the Santa Fe Burger and a side of cheese curds with a ginger beer from the fountain. I can't decide which I enjoyed the most. Everyone in our group ordered something different and we were all equally satisfied. The food here is delicious and very fresh. Apparently, the produce is purchased locally and daily. I can't wait to go back and try something else. My only recommendation other than you must try this place is to wear elastic waist pants. The portions are huge."}
{"text":"This place was amazing & very friendly we will definitely be eating here again!!! Thank you for the delicious food...very filling"}
{"text":"Okay food, good service, reasonable prices. Lots of soda choices, a whole lot. I tried a sub sandwich, kraut dog, cheeseburger, and cheese fries. Perhaps we didn't order the \"good\" versions of those things, but although what we did get was edible, just nothing special at all. It was ok."}
{"text":"I got the rocket burger which was $12.99 but it's a great deal considering it has three 1/4 pound hamburger patties hidden below a chunk of roast beef and peppers and onions.

What an amazing burger/sandwich!!! 

It had mouthwatering incredible flavors and the meat and bell peppers were extremely tender and delicious.   They make their own roast beef and its layered on on top of your burger along with grilled onions, bell peppers, and melted cheese.  

What was crazy is that I could smell the burger on my fingers several hours after lunch.  It was soooo good!   Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, and was served to me in a mostly timely manner for how busy they were. The selection of sodas is amazing! The only reason I wouldn't give this place all 5 stars is because the lobby was pretty dirty coming in. All of the tables were well used and that doesn't appeal to me. Otherwise, good place!"}
{"text":"Rocket Burger is a fun place to go for lunch and the food is excellent!

My favorite so far is their Philly Burger.  The double size is only $6.99 and is very filling. It's topped with grilled green peppers and onions, along with provolone cheese and mayonnaise. Another good sandwich is their California Club.  It comes with Turkey breast, tomato, avocado, sprouts, cheese and mayonnaise.  It's on whole wheat sub that only costs $6.69. Both are great!

I've also had their roast beef sub.  It has roasted peppers, provolone, and yummy horseradish mayonnaise, along with lettuce and tomatoes for $6.69.  If you are seeing a trend on prices here, that's because all of their medium sandwich or double hamburgers are $6.69. But, they do have smaller sizes which start at $4.49.

One of the most cool and impressive things about Rocket Burger is their assortment soft drinks bottles in their refrigerated case behind where you sit. They say it's over three hundred. Have you ever had a Judge Wapner root beer? How about a Dad's Cream Soda, maybe Grape Nehi, Royal Crown? It's impressive that's for sure.

My friends, Arlin B and Rand H have written glowingly about their sandwiches. But the best line comes from Arlin regarding their double burger pastrami.  He says: \"It was a mouth watering double burger that came with Hot Pastrami stacked on top of the two patties covered in melty-cheesy goodness, toppings and their thousand island dressing.  It was FANTASTIC!!\" 

Got the visual image? Good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good verifying of burgers... Tons of different ways to make a burger just the way you want it...tons and tons of soda options.. The place isn't all that ..it looks a little stand off ish but all's good.....a definite must"}
{"text":"Came here because it's in my area. Mostly positive Yelp reviews.  Withhold judgement on negative reviews till I tried it myself. With that. Had a truly great experience.  Ordered a double bacon cheeseburger.  Opted to go without the Rocket sauce (house made 1000 thousand island). The patties were not overly large,  but cooked perfectly. Juicy. On par with 5 guys.  Along with the fries. Loved em. The local is a tad beat up, but not ghetto. The kicker is there is more choices of soda than you could drink in a year. Was a trip down childhood memory lane, seeing some of those sodas. Will be back to try the subs."}
{"text":"Delicious chili burger, I was impressed by the soft bun and the tender burger. Over all a great experience, they were fast at getting the food out to us and the experience of looking at all the sodas they have out was a great part of the lunch we had there. Very family friendly"}
{"text":"Big-ass tasty burgers! I have no complaints with this place other than their $2 bottled sodas. That's kinda ridiculous if you ask me. I would definitely recommend this place but it's just not worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"Service was great. My husband had a burger & I had a chicken sandwich. Only thing that saved my meal was the fries. I didn't finish my sandwich, it was just eh. I wanted to take more time to look at all the  different sodas but it was pretty busy so I felt like I was in the way. If I'm in the area I will probably be back for some of their neat sodas but not for the food."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers overall.  Their basic cheeseburger is just okay.  If you're into soda they have a ridiculously large selection from the soda pop store next door."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhmmmmaaazziing! I had the mexi-burger and it was probably the single best burger I have ever had. Perfectly juicy and crisp. The fries were also very good. and oh my the soda selection. I did the math and there is about 500 different sodas. A must go in my opinion."}
{"text":"My favorite go to burger place! I've been here a few times now, and each time the burger was great. They have a lot of different styles of burgers and offer other types of sandwiches as well."}
{"text":"Okay so I've said before that I'm a big fan of owner operated businesses, and small local businesses. This place is one of them. You walk in the door and to your left are six refrigerator doors chocked full of about 250 different specialty sodas. All priced at a $1.89 and to your right there are the two owners and two helpers. One of the owners is at the cash register and handling the customer service and the other is that the sandwich table whipping up delicious hamburgers subs and the like. Very friendly and helpful!!!!! 

While I was there I asked a couple questions of the owners. One was do they weigh the meat before they load it into the sandwich? The guy at the sandwich making table shook his head no and said we want to make it good. Indicating they just cut a lot in there until it looks right. Needless to say my sandwich was well portioned. Rand H. and I both got a Large Ruben on Sourdough and split an order of fries. I really like this place for a lot of reasons, some of which I noted in my review. While we were eating I saw a few more orders roll by and they were all generous servings that looked delish."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch with my friend and tried the New York burger and fries and my friend had the Santa Fe burger. Everything was so good! We also had some mushrooms and they were delicious! 
They have sooooo many sodas to choose from!! I tried a cucumber drink and my friend tried a butterscotch one. The girl at the register was so friendly and the guy who brought us our food was very kind as well. The young lady even came out to ask us how everything was. Very happy with the food and the service. Will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I went to Rocket Burger all the way from Scottsdale to look for a particular soda only sold in the midwest. We were surprised they had that one and a huge selection of other ones to boot! Including a chocolate maple bacon one, and some weird flavors we couldn't help but snap chat.

We had the burger (I think santa fe??) with cole slaw, salsa, and avocado. The service was quick, and the burger was to die for! Along with it, we had the cajun fries. We will certainly be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"The area is pretty sketchy, but the burger was great.

There were tons of interesting menu items and I wish I could try each one, but I went with the standard cheese burger.  Of course I had to get it \"Rocket\" style though.  The burger plus an order of fries could have easily been a challenge on Man vs. Food.  With that said I couldn't finish the fries and burger which is a rarity for me.  For about ten bucks it was a pretty good value and well worth it.  The burger was well seasoned, cooked perfectly and wasn't greasy.  The bun held up great so I didn't make a mess of my shirt as is almost always the case when I have a burger.

I will definitely return because the Eddie Lopez burger has my name all over it!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have to say it has been a great experience every time. I've primarily had their rocket sized cheeseburgers with bacon and everything has a home cooked taste to it. It is obvious the food is made with love here, and it is always reassuring to see the owner hard at work in the restaurant serving customers, not to mention cooking.

Probably the only disappointing thing is that the last time we went their cheese curds were overly salty. Note I have a HIGH tolerance for salt, and this was even too much for me, it was extremely over the top. Let them know about it through email and they never did respond which is disappointing, but considering how good everything else is here I'll let it slide."}
{"text":"The burgers are great, a little greasy but delicious. Their's a great list of burgers to choose from. I try a new one every time I go and have never had one that I didn't like. If your new try the New Yorker or the Teriyaki Burger (be advised both are extremely messy but delicious). If you never have been here you should try it out. O yea, I forgot to mention their is like 500 different sodas to choose from!!!"}
{"text":"First time coming here the burgers we're really good.  I order the cali burger and i liked it alot also they have lots of drinks you can choose from and employees were nice."}
{"text":"My husband proclaimed the Afterburner chicken sandwich to be the best sandwich he has ever had, but warns that it is not for the faint of heart. I enjoyed a Garlic Melt with grilled chicken and our son scarfed down his kid's cheeseburger. Great sandwiches! Great buns! Great fries and sauce! Great drinks! And, the owner was incredibly kind and warm. We'll definitely return next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Rocket Burger's teriyaki burger was 12 inches of messy, drippy, delicious madness. I probably used at least 10 napkins while eating that thing, but looking like a socially unacceptable slob was so worth it. It was huge, tasty, and took me from \"hungry\" to \"omgwhydididothat\" in no time. Rocket Burger is America.

In addition to selling ludicrously sized burgers, Rocket Burger also sports an impressive collection of specialty sodas. The vast walls of varied sodas more closely resembles the beer selection of a very-good liquor store, which alludes to the restaurants previous life as a bodega. 

If you've got a 12 inch burger and a soda, then you most likely don't need a side dish, but for fellow Yelpers with monstrous appetites, their fresh-cut fries are wonderful. I haven't tried the onion rings or cheese curds yet, but I don't know if my body is ready just yet. 

If you're suffering from an extreme calorie deficit or just wanna stuff your face like no one's looking, make Rocket Burger a priority."}
{"text":"Yikes. 

Lady that answered sounded confused and didn't seem to speak English that well. Completely messed up our order. I repeated and confirmed my order with her and everything seemed okay, but everything ended up being wrong. All sandwiches were incorrect and gave us three extra orders of fries (four total)...I told her \"ONE order of chilli cheese fries.\""}
{"text":"I like the kraut dog... Haven't had one like it since I lived in GA. ... I had one of the fountain ginger beer... Again hadn't had one since GA. ... Their onion rings, fried zucchini,and their cheese curds are great...
I will also recommend their Chicago dog... Just like back east... They have many great sodas from all around the world...  Love, Love, Love them..."}
{"text":"You walk in and see so many different kinds of soda. That's really cool. Cashier dude didn't really act like he wanted to be there, wasn't really excited to try it because of that to be honest. I got the Philly burger with mushrooms and it came out quickly! It was so damn good. The fries were a bit under done but still good enough to eat! I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! This place is FANTASTIC! 
I was super starving this afternoon and was craving a good burger. I remember going to this joint about a year ago with some co-workers and decided to head on over again.
The place seems to have grown since I was there a year ago. The counter seems to be back more than before but maybe I'm just going crazy.

Anyway, on to the experience! I was quickly helped at the counter by a very nice guy who took my order. 
I ended up getting the Eddie Lopez Burger which had a SUPER tasty burger,  pastrami and is topped with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, swiss, and rocket dressing!  The only bad part was the part when it was all gone!

I also ordered the Onion Rings. I am not even a fan of onion rings but I had to give them a try since everyone suggested them. Wow! There was a pile of them and they were so good!

Next time I'm getting a double! 
Forget going to any of those franchise burger places, hit this place up and be prepared to drool!"}
{"text":"Great mom and pop hole in the wall kind of place.  Food is great--everything we've ever ordered was tasty.  It's not the most amazing burger in the world but it beats fast food, and at a similar price point.  Also delicious are the deep fried sides (zucchini, mushrooms, pickles, etc), and they have an amazing selection of glass bottled sodas.  One area of concern is the strip mall it's in needs renovation, the parking lot is too small/confusing, and Church's Chicken is awkwardly placed.  Oh well, what can you do, it's 35th avenue."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed here. Amazing food, tons of cool sodas to choose from if you want to pick some up on the way out. Every time I have been there the owner has too, he is in the back cooking and is a really great guy."}
{"text":"I had the flamethrower.  OMG spicy ghost pepper cheese. Too spicy.. and I LOVE spice. So spicy I couldnt taste the burger. I know how hot ghost pepper is. I just didnt think they would put that much into the cheese.  I peeled half of the cheese off. I couldve benefit from a glass of milk. I dont like the diced onions they use.  Otherwise perfect little joint! Awesome place. I want to go back just to try more sodas. Super cool and unique."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place serves some absolutely delicious burgers. Let me start with the Garlic Melt, this was no hint of garlic burger but one exploding with garlic cheesy goodness, just the way it should be served with a name like that! Then comes the Santa Fe, it comes with a scrumptious huge piece of corn meal battered deep fried green chili...that's all I have to really say about that!  Check out my pics and God bless you in Jesus name!"}
{"text":"The burgers here aren't bad, but they aren't the best I've ever had either. The staff here is friendly and the service is pretty fast. It is a small place and it can get hot during the summer. The big bonus here is their gigantic selection of sodas. They have all kinds of flavored sodas from root beers, ginger beers and creme sodas and even energy drinks. So if you're looking to quench your thirst with a hard to find soda, this is the place to try!"}
{"text":"The Baja Burger and Teriyaki Burger are absolutely amazing. Huge selection of unique sodas. Try Snozzberry at the fountain. Huge menu great prices. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Looking for a great burger joint with never ending variety of sodas?  Then you found your place.  Rocket Burger is another one of those diamonds in the rough.  A classic no frills burger place with plenty of flavor and a vast selection of sodas to wash it down.  
     For my visit I had the Eddie Lopez burger which is your standard burger topped with pastrami and some of their rocket sauce.  The pastrami was excellent with just the right amount of caramelizing and not too crazy with the sauce.  The burger was well seasoned and bursting with juicy flavor.  You gotta love when a place seasons their burgers correctly.  The included fries were also seasoned quite heavy, but I feel this is a classic burger place style, especially when you're piling them down with plenty of ketchup.  
     You can't have a proper greasy spoon burger with out a good soda to wash it down.  Luckily Rocket Burger offers over 1,000 sodas, juices, and teas.  They have everything from obscure energy drinks to classic Mexican Cokes, it would take years to taste every soda in this place.  Even if you're not a burger fan you can easily find something you like in the cooler.
     Overall Rocket Burger was fantastic, and I will be going back to enjoy another delicious meal."}
{"text":"Where has this place been my whole life? FOR REAL! This place is incredible! If your reading this, stop debating where your going to go eat and get your booty over to Rocket Burger & Subs. 
We've been there two times now and both times we've been floored. The owner/operator is a burger genius and has created an incredible menu. 

Quick run down:
-500 different craft sodas... at least
-Delicious burgers (Best in town by far, no joke)
-Huge portions 
-No regrets

Love this place, go check it out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in based on reviews. Had the Santa Fe burger with onion rings. Both good and definitely the rings were worth the stop. Family members had rocket burgers which were filling but I think the burgers are fine. Small location with sparse seating... Minimal ac so it was tough to sit and enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"This place was great.  The soda selection is obviously amazing- over 400 different bottles.  The people were nice and the food was good.  I would go back anytime I an in the valley."}
{"text":"This place made a quick, great burger. They have enough variety to satiate any tastes (if that taste is for something burgerlike) and their wall of unconventional soda and NA beverages is worth the trip on its own.  In one trip it has been a staple of the area."}
{"text":"Good food
Great atmosphere
Great customer service
Brought back childhood memories with the sodas from the past

I will be back"}
{"text":"Rocket burger is one of those hard to find restaurants that once you do find it not only are you locked in for life but you are full the rest of the day. I took the family after reading some reviews from my friends on rocket burger as I'm sure many can attest there aren't many good burger places in phoenix that aren't part of some fancy restaurant.  My kids ate every bite without whining and the hamburgers are big and scrumptious.  I got the rocket chili cheese burger, every bite was heaven. Here I am 6 hours later still full. Oh and it's pretty inexpensive too. Definitely recommend trying the bacon cheeseburger, cooked to perfection I couldn't stop taking bites out of my wife's burger."}
{"text":"My wife finally caved in today and went to Rocket Burger & Subs after hearing great things about it.  As for me personally, Eek ! Methinks not.

The burger patty was big but thin.  The fries were bascially the frozen in a bag type at your local grocery store.  Seriously !

Are you kidding me ?  Everybody knows that the fries compliment the burger and if your fries are weak that kills the burger.

My wife brags along with the other reviewers that they have 300 sodas to choose from.  To me that is just 300 ways to get diabetes.

Look, the burger was whack, the fries are the frozen variety and I could care less about 300 sodas.

Rocket Burger & Subs Eek! Methinks not."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. I'm a regular there, and they are always awesome. Large quantities of food for a cheap price and definitely have something on the menu for everyone. Not to mention all the sodas they have. Its one of the very very few places that have Faygo."}
{"text":"Gone to this place a few times and its been good. ( see past review ) decided to go tonight to try the rocket burger... Well lets just say I was highly disappointed tonight. I ordered online and my large burger was supposed to be nice and long sub style. Well instead the chopped it in half and threw it in a box. So much philly cheese steak cheese and peppers that i couldnt even taste the actual burger. It was flowing off the sides. I couldnt even pick it up with my hands. Literally. That gets me to the next point. It was so covered in junk that the bottom bread was literally soaking wet. Mostly grease from what I can tell. Absolutely not edible. Presentation on this burger was literally 0. I mean... I had to use a fork. Greasy toppings with hardly any bun. So our next item was a large cheese curd. It came in tinfoil in a to go box and was extremely greasy. The top looked presentable but the bottom was covered in grease. Let it sit hanging in the fryer longer next time! Disgusting. After just a half of my burger and 3 cheese curds I was feeling quite ill. Not food poisoning type sickness but certainly queasy probably from all the grease I just ingested. Honestly, I don't think ill be back. What a shame.  Pictures posted. There is actually a burger and some bun somewhere under all those toppings."}
{"text":"Try the New Yorker just the way they recommend it and you won't be disappointed.  It may be the best New Yorker, I've had.  Also, try the brownie with homemade whip cream, hot out of the oven, mmmm so delicious.

My girlfriend loved the veggie sub, and while she normally stays away from shoestring fries, these shoestrings were mouth popping.  Also, there were sooo many different novelty sodas in the bottle to choose from, I can see the quest beginning here to try, but not succeed at tasting them all.

The food was great, but what really put this place over the top for us, was the friendly service.  You could tell they really wanted our business."}
{"text":"Darn good burger n skinny fries!  Too bad and lucky so far for me. Driving friend to her car n found this place craving a burger....cool old time feel, great service...cheap!   If I'm ever on this side of town again.... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Chandler. Super friendly owners. We have dined in and ordered to go. They don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Was not at all impressed with this place. I ordered the double cheese and fries...their burgers are not good at all. Very salty the sauce was the thing that ruined it. It had such a peculiar taste to it. The girl at the counter said it was thousand island..but it had a bad tangy taste to it, my bread was soggy from the pickles. I tried working my way around it took some stuff out got rid of the top bun and just couldn't finish it. The meat doesn't seem to be fresh either. They look like those round frozen patties yuck! Was pretty upset I was expecting an awesome burger  :("}
{"text":"We were in the area so we stopped in for lunch on Saturday. I had a regular cheeseburger and the BF had a regular chili cheeseburger. We shared a side of chili cheese fries and onion rings. That and two can sodas came out to about $14. Sweet deal! Food was good. The burger buns were good... (I think they make their own?), the meat was nicely cooked and it was tasty. The burgers come with shredded lettuce... normally I'm not a fan, but in this burger I didn't mind so much. The onion rings were coated with cornmeal and was nice and crispy. Not overcooked or undercooked, they were just right. The chili cheese fries was huge. That could be a meal on it's own and then some. Also, I liked the fact that they had gingerale =)

So, basically... it's a place to consider if you're in the area but I wouldn't make any special trips from Chandler for it. But I might just find excuses to go out this way just so I can eat here again ;) Oh and the people there were super nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger for on the cheap.  

Fries are soggy but ...

The bun needs to be moister.  Pretty dry

But it's unique and fun for a visit every now and then."}
{"text":"Picked up Waialua Hawaiian soda for my restrnt, and decided to have lunch there also. Previously had the double cheeseburger w/ bacon and fries was at least a five napkin lunch!!! Decided to try the New York burger today! What can I say but another winner!!! The pastrami was flavorful and the burger juicy! Cole slaw was spot on also. The owner was from Hawaii also Filipino descent very nice lady. Think this going to be my to go burger place. Prices are very reasonable for the high quality you are getting. Thank you Rocket Burger!!! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Tried the Afterurner Burger with smoky ghost pepper jack cheese (Amazing), and my wife had the Chicago Burger with homemade onion rings (Delish)! Awesome burgers. Fantastic variety of sodas. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped here with my four year old yesterday with a Groupon.  We had lunch here.  I had a gyro with fries; he had a hotdog and fries.  The fries were simply amazing!  Perfectly prepared and delicious.  The gyro was done perfectly - not burnt or dry.  

The interior is nothing special - a tv, some chairs and tables.  The people behind the counter are terrific.  

If you like soda, this is the place for you.  They even had my home town favorite - FAYGO!  Plenty of great energy drinks.

The prices are reasonable.

Stop by........."}
{"text":"So awesome. I ordered the philly cheese sub and it was perfect. Cheesy. Thin, tender steak. Not dry but not too juicy. The fries were also seasoned well. They had so many portions of soda to choose from but as it was my first time, I ordered a fountain drink. I will def be returning when I'm in The Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I stop in every chance I get, usually for lunch when I head out of town to Vegas or Sedona.
10 visits ... plus , always fast, always tasty.

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Great prices.  Hundreds of different kinds of sodas!  Had turkey, roast beef sandwiches - good.  Sandwiches are better toasted.  Chicago dog - yum!  Cheeseburger - ok"}
{"text":"First of all the food was sooo good! We got subs and they were awesome! The rocket sauce is so yummy! The reason I knocked them down one star is because they are so slow!!! It took us 30min to get our food!!! I guess next time I will be calling it in first before I show up!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I tried this place in search of a delish burger. Omg. When I say this place by the spot, that's an understatement. I kinda wish they had beer, but that's not a big deal. We got the garlic Swiss and the southwest burgers. Both were so good. The buns are soft and fresh, taste like brioche. One order of fries is plenty for two people. The owner (I think) was super nice and helpful. The southwest burger has a deep fried green chile on it! We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! And yes if you are going to splurge this IS the place to do it! I especially like the Breaded Cheese Curds. The menu is outrageous. The employees I think are a family. I'll tell all my coworkers to try it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger joints. I don't  like the chain restaurants with there frozen burgers. Rocket burger uses fresh beef and you can tell. The side items are just as good, you must try the cheese curds. The beverage choice are endless with there soda wall, you name they probably have it. I always get one to go, as i am addicted to the snozzberry in the fountain drink selection. It's a little out of my way, but worth the drive."}
{"text":"Much better than smash burger. 
The bread they use on their burgers are wonderful, the bacon crunchy 
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place while we were in town for a baseball tournament last week and goodness we are so grateful! The best burgers, good fries, beyond delicious  chicken tenders and a housemade rocket sauce that you will want to drink!! Also a plethora of sodas from around the world!! The fountain ginger beer was my fave!! Will definitely return everytime we are in town!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp today.  Can't believe I've never heard of it!  

Crazy selection of sodas, (picture Rocket Fizz + some).  Old school burgers and sandwiches abound here.  My friend ordered the Cali Burger and loved it.  I ordered the Afterburner Chicken sandwich and loved it, except the bun fell appart and was a little big for the sandwich.  The fries were really good, but the onion rings were exceptional.  I am very picky about onion rings and usually stay from them.  These only have a thin batter coating, and it's very flavorful.  

I'll go back to try several of the other menu items, and the onion rings again!"}
{"text":"Fun!
Went on a frivolous date night w/my boyfriend, and this was the beginning. 
Soda pop heaven! I was laughing at all the varieties. You have a craving for an unusual soda, this is the place to go. 
We ordered chili cheese dogs and french fries. Everything was really tasty, hot, and the staff was extremely nice.  The only thing that kept it from getting that 5th star was the tables all needed cleaning.  Bits of food on all of them. 
Will absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"I wont be suprised if the account mgr w yelp that handles this restaurant takes this review down. Looked at reviews and got excited, sped down here bc they closed in a few minutes. Was amazed by the huge selection of bottles soda. It was quite impressive. Liked the simple, easy to order recipe. The food on the other hand stinked. The chilli dog was bland. The Chicago dog was good. And the onion ring and fries were prob the worst I've had at a quick svc restaurant. This is my 5th
bad yelp rec, and it's sad. No one likes to eat bad food. Well in this case, I ate a few bites :("}
{"text":"I found me a new burger joint! This place was absolutely fantastic! I got the Santa Fe burger and the green chile was what I was hoping for, nice and spicy. I also had the chili cheese fries, which were huge, I should not have eaten so much but it was too good to stop. I will definitely make this a regular stop when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I stopped in after reading about it here.... Ordered the Eddie Lopez Burger (Double)... First of all, the burger is huge... a single would have been fine, but hey, who's counting calories?
I really enjoyed this burger...every bite of it...
Next time I will venture to try either the bacon burger or the Cali burger.
Great service...And the coolest thing I have seen in a long time is their bottle soda fridges..must have been 8 of them... They had every kind of soda you can imagine... I'm talking about sodas from way back when...Ones I didn't think were out there any more..
Can't wait to bring my family back for dinner."}
{"text":"I was looking for an alternative to 5 guys.  I'll stick with 5 guys.  They have better tasting burgers and are about the same price."}
{"text":"OMGGGGG sooooo good I love this place!!!! Just moved from Chicago and haven't found a great place to eat like this in months! I love it service is great. The atmosphere and decor is so different I recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best food hands down!!!!!!!  Have amazing burgers and subs both. The fried mushrooms and zucchini are the bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"Burgers were good. The sides are great. Skip the fries and get the zucchini or mushrooms. Next time I'm going to have to dig into their selection of Root Beers... Can't wait!"}
{"text":"There's a reason this place has 4.5 stars. I am so glad Yelp let me find this place and am sure there are many places all around the Valley which I am also missing but have the hope of finding now that I use Yelp! This is the perfect little mom & pop burger and sub shop! The burgers are out of this world and my wife likes their subs. If you check in on Facebook or Yelp you get a 10% discount as well. So far of the 2 times I have gone I haven't spent more than $13 for me and my wife both! And I'm talking about stuff like a double cheeseburger and fries for me and a large sub for her, good stuff! Here is my first review of little places I found using Yelp, I'm sure there will be more!"}
{"text":"NY Burger, fries and a soda. Drank the craft root beer on tap.

The soda was stellar, loved it.

The sandwich was ok. Not balanced well, pastrami was very light... if I didnt see it I wouldnt know it was even there.

Fries were old school shoe string. Nothing great.

The building itself is run down and beat up. Not a lot of work having been put into it at all.

Staff is excellent. Great people and great service.

Four stars for the soda selection and originality of menu. Will probably go back for one more pass at it but only because the reputation is good, first experience wasnt positive enough on its own."}
{"text":"I must apologize to Norm , Daren and Iain for not listening to my favorite 
No Pho friends sooner.. Because I made a BIG mistake waiting to go here!! I will promptly make up for it by going as many times as possible this week!! 

I love this place , yup local owned with a sense of mom and pop goodness. Reminds you of back east...The soda selection is phenomenal and looks great on display as you eat. 

The Ruben is my new favorite , rye bread , juicy well seasoned pastrami, sauerkraut and light toasty goodness. 
Plus one had the Cheese steak that was really good except he opted for extra heat and I couldn't handle it .. but still great. 
Fries are fresh and plentiful ....one basket will serve 2-3 people . 

Go here Go here now ....and take a friend , let's not waste another moment."}
{"text":"I nearly cheated on you Rocket. The siren calls of the uber super deal of the restaurant next door was calling my name. I resisted the temptation of cheap chicken and ordered the California Club sandwich, fries and a diet Dr. Pepper for $6.54 (it's $2 dollars cheaper if you remember to bring the coupon).

The California Club has generous portions of avocado, and perfectly cooked crispy well done bacon with tomatoes and turkey. It also comes with lettuce and sprouts if you're into that sort of thing. I had my sandwich on toasted rye bread. The fries are served in a separate basket from the sandwich, outstanding, the cook(owner) didn't put any salt on these fries since he remembered I'm not into salt. And they even serve the fries with ketchup already in one of those ketchup tubs; now that's what I call service. Oh, the California Club was outstanding as usual.

I have had the burgers before, and all I can say is they rock as well. I'm not a big fan of the onion rings, but others seem to enjoy them.

This place delivers affordable food that will keep you returning for more, and with the spirit of the political ad season, I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE."}
{"text":"Rocket Burger & Subs is a very casual and divey. You won't get the most high end burger in the valley but you'll get 100% angus flat patties that are prepared to your likening  and are delicious with several choices of sizes and toppings. Besides burgers they offer sandwiches, subs, beef hot dogs, soft serve, floats and the biggest selection of bottled sodas I've ever seen. Portions are very large and prices aren't much more than fast food. You are getting food that's MUCH Better than fast food.

After watching RB&S on Check Please Arizona I went with what everyone else tried the popular NY Double Burger with fries. I liked that they carefully toasted the buns and the burgers were prepared medium just like I asked for and were juicy and tasty. A generous amount of tasty grilled pastrami and house made slaw and rocket sauce topped the burger. It was all good tasty and humungous and a giant amount of fresh cut fried potatoes were yummy too. 

Check out Rocket Burger!

It's a Blast!"}
{"text":"Seriously don't know how this place has almost 5 stars. Ordered the mexi burger and it had so much condiments on it I couldn't see the meat. Bun was so big I threw half of it away. My patty was cold from all the salsa and stuff that was on it. Also, I don't know how you can mess up bacon, but they did. It was fried so bad I thought it was metal. Only reason it gets a star is for the drink selection. That was awesome"}
{"text":"Great new find! We had the burgers & fries but I will definitely be back for the subs, especially a roast beef! 

The gal running the counter was perfect for the job! Bubbly, informative and put a great sell job on the roast beef sandwiches. 

The fried onion rings, mushrooms and zucchini are calling me back as well. I'll be back Rocket!

If your not into tangy sauce skip the rocket sauce and go for the traditional ketchup mustard. 

Prices were very reasonable and the beef was delicious. Don't expect a big seating area. Maybe 4 tables inside and a few out. 
Give'em a try!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool and interesting place for burgers and more.   The more is their soda selection which is unbelievable!  Kids will love it!  Parents will enjoy a good burger there too!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but did not live up to the hype.  I've been told about this place by many people and that I, \"have to try it\".  So I tried it, a few times.  The burgers are not bad, the meat patties themselves are not good but the cheese, bacon and toppings were good.  The meat patties did not have a good flavor to them, and I mainly went to this place for the burgers!  The fries were soggy and had a burnt look to them but they were not burnt, they tasted decent.  The Chicago dog is bomb, great fresh toppings and the fried zucchini isn't bad.  Overall, not a bad spot, but would prefer other local burger joints."}
{"text":"Just moved to Phoenix about a month ago and got around to trying this place earlier this week. I've already been back!! The first time I got a bacon cheeseburger, which was delicious and today I got the New Yorker sandwich (pastrami, cole slaw, Swiss and rocket sauce) which was even more tasty!! I could swim in the rocket sauce they put on everything!! Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints in the area. Their afterburner sandwich is amazing! Everything is freshly made."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks  ago actually just moved to the neighborhood kind of looking for a hole in the wall restaurant and we saw this because there is awesome pop shop next-door that carry pops that I believe is also connected to the rocket Burger shop. Was really good the interior was really cool to be that I had a whole bunch of old authentic sign and it looks like it was probably family run probably still is , good food, price was great, they had all sorts of different pops along the back wall very clean so definitely would go back there again."}
{"text":"We stopped into the soda shop next door which is also owned by the same people. There selection of soda was very extensive. We saw different sodas from all over the country and the world. After purchasing a few bottles we went next door to grab lunch. We had just a regular burger and a gyro. Both were delicious and very well cooked. The service was very friendly and help explain some of the items on the menu. The only reason it didn't get five stars from me is because the place looks pretty ran down. Someone consider it a hole in the wall. It's really just preference. The food is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great food! 
Was in the mood for a burger, heard about this place for awhile. Packed the family up and had a great lunch here.
I had the bacon cheeseburger and chili cheese fries. Burger was great, Bun, cheese, bacon, ground beef. It's a little big, and messy but worth it. Kids loved the hot dogs, and fries. Wife enjoyed her burger also. There were other options on the menu I would love to try next time. 
Parking is not the best, but thats the way it goes. Not a lot of seating, however there are some. When we where there, they were have an issue with their soda fridge leaking water. Watch your step.
Over all we had a great time, this is a place with great food!"}
{"text":"Very cool place. Right when you walk in a huge fridge of all kinds of different Sodas. 20-30 different kinds of Root Beer, Cream Soda, Etc. Burgers even better. Very unique place."}
{"text":"The Soda Pop Shop is the star of the show here.  The selection is very good.  Plus, I've heard if they  don't have it, they can order it for you.  The food was ok, but not the standout I hoped for.  French fries were served hot, but the burger was not.  Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm sitting at Rocket Burger as I write this. No need to mull anything over today. This is my first, my inaugural visit. I can say workout a doubt, without equivocation, I just enjoyed the best burger I've ever had!

Mine, the Philly Burger, was a flavor explosion cooked perfectly and accompanied with awesome fries. 

They offer a wonderful selection of fountain and bottle sodas I've never seen before. Dead World Zombie Orange Soda? They have it. They have it all. 

I'm so full. It was so good! !"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good burger joint and this is it! Had the double Chicago burger and fries and it was outstanding! Place has a huge selection of soft drinks and pretty good fries. It's a little divy, but I prefer that. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had never heard of Rocket Burger & Subs until our neighbor told us how good the food is.  Last night my husband and I tried it.  He had the Bacon Cheeseburger and I had the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich with fries and a drink. We both really liked the food.  I don't usually like fries but these were very good.  Never saw so many different kinds of soda.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Did we order the wrong burgers? We just were not impressed with Rocket Burger & Subs.

Two of us ordered burgers and the other ordered a chicken sandwich. I opted for the Cali burger and the main flavors I could glean were the special sauce, avocado, and lettuce. The thin slab of beef was smothered by the sauce and veggies it had no chance of being savored unless eaten alone. Maybe I needed to make it a double but the single was already large. I think the focus of the burger was put toward the additives and not the patty. At least my friend enjoyed her special crispy garlic chicken sandwich.

The fries were our favorite side and the cooler after cooler of a gazillion different types of sodas was impressive. Service was fast and friendly but right now the next visit to Phoenix will not include Rocket Burgers, unless it's for fries and their unique selection of soda."}
{"text":"I have to admit, the burger disappointed me.  I had high hopes after reading reviews, but I didn't feel it lived up to the hype.  I got the $3.99 cheeseburger deal.  The saving grace of my lunch, besides the price, were the fries.  Skinny, salty, and just crispy enough, they truly made my day.  I enjoyed my In-N-Out burger far more, but Rocket fries are superior."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and most original burger menu I've seen.  Try the Chicago burger and make it a double.  Fries are great too and Rocket Burger offers the best selection of soda in any restaurant in Phoenix. 
Locations in Phoenix on 35th Ave & Cactus and Chandler too.  Privately owned by a couple of guys who love the craft and have truly created burgers that are works of art!"}
{"text":"I loved there Baja burger! The slaw and salse in that burger went extremely well. The workers here are nice as well to always ask how our food was and if we enjoyed it. I had a smile on my face the first bite of that burger. The zuchini and onion rings were huge portions, so that was a plus. They overcooked them alil bit, but i still enjoyed them with the dipping ranch sauce!"}
{"text":"I have been trying to find an amazing sub spot here in the east valley ever since I moved to AZ approximately 10 years ago!  And I think Rocket Burgers & Subs may be my spot! ;) 

I was first drawn here after reviewing several great 5 star yelp reviews, so of course I could not resist testing this establishment out and determining if it's worthy of a nearly 5 star yelp review ... 

DRUM ROLL please .... And, so here are my findings:

Location/Customer Service wise:  it was a little hard to find since it's located in a fairly large sized plaza and you can't see the sign from the road, but when I called in to ask for specific directions the staff was very helpful guiding me in ... Similarly, when I called my take out order in, the staff was friendly and helpful and there were no issues with my order, so customer service wise this place passed with flying colors... 

The atmosphere:  it's cool - it's a small mom and pops type feel, pretty simple, nothing extravagant; it seemed simple and clean ...

THE FOOD:  the Philly cheesesteak sub itself was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS... Probably the best I have had since living in AZ;  it's definitely good quality beef ... Many cheesesteak places utilize fake/imitation types of beef in their cheese steaks and there is a monumental difference, and I appreciate this business for providing its customers with a top notch quality product!!  

The price:  the only reason I was not able to give this business a 5 star yelp review is because I think a large cheesesteak sub should definitely come with at least one side for $9.49 ... At least throw in some fries or a bag of chips (it's inexpensive and it will help you sell more product at the end of the day).  I can't say the price point is insanely horrible, but I believe throwing in a side item @ 9.49 will help this business attain a more loyal following of regulars, because I will still hungry after finishing the large, and if there was just a little something more I would have been completely satisfied... and not only would Rocket have earned a 5 star review, but it would have immediately gained a several times a week regular/loyal customer ...

Overall, I was pleased for the most part... The price point issue is an easy fix, and I would absolutely recommend Rocket Burgers & Subs to friends/family!!"}
{"text":"Nothing Fancy but Oh So Good.

You couldn't tell by looking at the outside.  However, as the old adage goes \" You can't judge a book by its cover.\"  The same can be said about Rocket Burgers and Subs. Nothing fancy here but the food is oh so good.

The food at Rocket Burgers and Subs   doesn't cost much more than the average fast food establishments around town.  However, you would be challenged to find a burger that compares to the quality and taste of the food  served at Rocket Burgers and Subs.

Rocket Burgers and Subs serves up various styles of burgers, beef hot dogs, sandwiches, and of course subs.  On this visit I went with the Lunch Special ($4.99).  The lunch special consisted of a burger, fresh cut fries, and a soft drink.

The lunch special was a great price and the food was delicious.  The hamburger roll was perfectly grilled, hamburger  grilled to medium, and the fries which were made from fresh cut potatoes with skins  were seasoned perfectly and so tasty.

In addition to great food, Rocket Burgers has the largest selection of bottled sodas I have ever seen. Every soda combination you can imagine and even those you can't is served at Rocket Burger.

The  dining is casual. You order at the counter and seat yourself. The prices are more then reasonable, staff is friendly, portion sizes are large, and the food is delicious.  What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"What a friendly and clean place!  Burgers are big, juicy, good toppings but the meat had little taste to it.  Wish they served it better wrapped so it could be eaten without all that fallout.  Very unique collection of soft drinks from all over the U.S. and Canada.  They claim 300 different brands, WOW and all in the fridge by the front door and in 6 packs on a shelf near the back.  The fries they serve are the best I've tasted, no, not tasted, but eaten.  Impossible to not finish their big \"small portion\" fried right to the brink of burning but not burnt!!!  Tasty, Crispy, Pretty!
I would have given them 5 stars with just a touch of beefy flavor in the burgers.  I will try them again and so should you."}
{"text":"Not going to write an elaborate review because I dont have tons to say. 

Maybe i got the wrong items, but my burger was alright. The shredded lettuce paired with their house sauce made me feel like I was eating coleslaw. Maybe thats what they were going for? If so- congrats. If not- fix it. 

The fries were nothing special either. Greasy and not overly flavorful. Sometimes you get those greasy fries that you can feel how hard you will have to workout to get rid of them, but it is soooo worth it. These not so much. Drenched in grease and blah in flavor. 

The soda selection is cool, but I don't drink soda. Maybe just not my kind of place."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I like the fries so much!!! I wasn't a fan of the craft soda, but I haven't been a fan of it at all. I really liked the vibe in there. I just wish they had some more inside seating."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite burger spot. I legit come here multiple times a month. You cannot beat their burgers, fries, and incredible amounts of beverage options. 12/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"No A/C, sketchy area, ok food, filthy dining room, but damn, that's one impressive soda wall!"}
{"text":"Back again. Got the chili burger and fries.  Plus the soda (combo).

The chili burger was good.  The fries came out cold.  I suspect they were sitting around a while before my burger was ready.  Which really shouldn't happen.  However, when I commented on that they gave me a fresh batch of fries (VERY hot!).  So give them credit on that.

It's a greasy burger joint, but the greasy burgers and greasy fries are good!  And I really like that their soda fountain features craft sodas made with real sugar, not the usual Coke/Pepsi products.  That is truly awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome visit!  The Philly burger I had was perfect. Quality meat and bun. Awesome hand cut fries and craft sodas. The topper was meeting Steve, the owner. Great guy who truly has it all coming together right at this place."}
{"text":"This is a great burger place. Not your regular burger, but rather fresh unique tastes. I had the Eddie Lopez and it was full of flavor. Pastrami on the burger with veggies, Swiss cheese and Rocket sauce. Great selection of bottled soda. Owner and staff is super friendly and helpful. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"OMG I  in & out but this place really has an awesome burger. We got an Italian sub as well that was just amazing. Family owned friendly & endless supply of soda. I'm not a big fan of soda but did have a root beer on tap. Would of like a beer to go with the burger."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp. Another amazing find. In a world so dominated by fast drive thrus and cheap junk to take the edge off its nice to still walk into that hole in the wall that doesn't care how nice the new tile looks. This place is all about solid food. Bring your patience and your appetite. Both will be tested. Well worth the wait. This place re invigorates the reality that your burger doesn't need to be seen with cardboard."}
{"text":"Wowzas!  Yummy yummy to my tummy!  Best burger in town to date!  Selection of bottled sodas is un beatable!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp, for another great find in the ASU West area!

Hand breaded onion rings, homemade chili, and a wall full of sodas--I hope I sold you already. If not, try cheap. Like ridiculously cheap for every menu option.

Not much ambiance, but for a great burger, who's complaining? I like the bare bones decor, and I'm sure the high school kids would destroy anything more than that. Speaking of high school kids, if you want to avoid those heathens try to make to Rocket Burger before 2:30pm!"}
{"text":"After reading tons of reviews on this place, and considering its right up the street, I decided to give it a try. The soda selection was awesome but the food was just ok. The burger bun was twice the size of my double burger patties, although the bread was yummy. The sauce was way too sweet for my liking and tasted exactly like coleslaw dressing, and the bacon, instead of being nice crisp strips, it was chopped up burnt little scraps. The cheese fries were just ok too. I usually am a big fan of thin cut extra browned french fries but these had very little flavor, and zero salt. Fries should be salted as soon as they come out of the fryer while they are still wet or else the salt will never stick... Lastly, the older gentleman who took my order kind of seemed inconvenienced by having to take my order, which is a very uncomfortable feeing.  None of the food I ordered today was bad, it just wasnt all that great. I will probably be back to try a sub and some onion rings. Maybe I can give them a better review next time."}
{"text":"Best damn burger ever had. When you eat a burger, you want a greasy, cheesy, flavorful burger that melts in your mouth but doesn't break apart when you pick it up, and that's exactly what I got at rocket burger and subs. The place look very small and outdated but don't let that \"full\" you. I got the garlic mushroom burger, and it reminded of two creamy slices of mushroom cheese pizza with a juicy beef patty in between. It took me back through time and damn, I would 100% go back again next time I visit here cause this place is better than in n out and all the other main stream stuff you will find."}
{"text":"My first visit was last week. Good food and good prices. Had the burger and the wife had a sub. Both were very good. Good fries and rings as well.   If you order a \"combo\" you will get a HUGE basket of fries. Even my family (who loves to eat fries!) could share one order between two of us.

The interior needs a bit of TLC but these guys are just starting out and they are independent (which you have to love in our chain saturated restaurant).  The location is a bit ghetto but you don't need to pack heat. You do leave smelling like grease...so bring an extra shirt. :)

I really liked the huge selection of unique soda. The kids loved it too.  This was a really cool touch.

The owners are really friendly and nice and you just feel good supporting a local business. We need more restaurants like Rocket Burgers.  Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I work rarely close to this spot and decided I'd have lunch here.. So the food had no taste. The fries were bland along with the burger. The way the burger was loaded; I swear it'd have some great taste but looks can be deceiving! The bun was one I never had before but the inner burger itself was falling out while I tried to grip the burger and get to chowing down. Roughly $9.00+tax; but they had a special for $6.99 for a basic combo (surprisingly the guy didn't offer me that but whatevs!) The customer service was welcoming and nice. The cook just needs to be wary where he places his hands because he had almost touch every surface area while preparing my food but luckily my eye was on his hands like a hawk! Service was good, food was just lacking the taste&presentation; did not owe up to the $$"}
{"text":"We love this place- great food a massive menu selection. The cheeseburger kids meal is huge- so you can definitely get away with ordering that for a light eater. Also, fried zucchini is delicious. Wish I knew about this place when I was pregnant!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I ordered a burger combo with something they called the ghost pepper burger. Had some spicy cheese, bacon, and a few other things I don't really remember. Came with a large side of fries and a drink. The burger was great. I don't agree with other reviewers who said there is too much sauce. The sauce definitely dripped out, but the bun kept everything in place. The fries were cooked perfectly but could have used a bit more seasoning. Food came out very quickly.

The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the craft sodas. I didn't try any of the bottled sodas, but the craft fountain sodas were not my favorite. Still they also have standard sodas as well. So no worries there.

Will definitely be back. Used both the 10% off check in promotion and also got 10% cashback from yelp. After those, the meal is almost free!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best burger place in Arizona. I have been to the original and this is as good if not better than the original. The burgers are juicy and flavorful. The onion rings are crispy and have a lot of flavor. The fries are perfect. And don't forget those buttered buns, toasted on the griddle. Perfection!

I love the assortment of different bottles soda too! They also have hand made sodas on tap, no Coke or Pepsi here that I could find although I did see a bottle of cane sugar Mountain Dew. 

The owner was there too and we had a great chat. Super nice guy. We can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Being over on this side of town I was looking at places to eat this caught my eye on yelp. The burger was great, the bacon hot and crunchy and above all the fries were amazing. If I lived on this side of town I would eat there often. The selection sodas is overwhelming because they were so many. I had a cream soda. It was really good."}
{"text":"Teriyaki burger is my favorite, it's the best, the soda variety is huge! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday for the first time with my husband. We just got a cheeseburger and fries and  it was pretty tasty. They have a huge menu to choose from and their bottled drinks are so much fun! Not to mention the staff is super nice and goes out of their way to accommodate you. Good service is hard to come by these days."}
{"text":"This is quite literally the best burger I have ever eaten. The rocket bacon cheeseburger with 3 patties of meat on a 10 in. sesame sub roll and is nothing short of amazing. It could easily be shared. The cheese fries and onion rings are homemade. We love the casual environment and the huge selection of glass bottled soda. To top it off the prices are amazing! This is our first time here but we are hooked. We would love to see this place on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives, DDDinfo@mac.com, so if you love it here, nominate it!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Rocket Burger and I was excited to finally try it. I like to support smaller local businesses.  Unfortunately it was a let down for me and my daughter, and did not live up to my expectations.  

On a positive note, the teriyaki burger I ordered was tasty and the fries were good.  It appears that the owner or manager haven't visited or represented the store in the while based the interior condition.  My daughter wanted a hot dog and was told we are out of hot dogs (there is a Bashas 600 feet away). She settled for a burger which she did not finish.  They were out of ketchup in the pump container.  When I asked the worker for more, he left for 5 minutes and never returned (think it was the end of his shift and he just left).  Another employee assisted (thanks).  The huge refrigerator that holds all the specialty soda pops was broken so no cold ones for you.  Plus the wood around it looked unfinished and hanging off.  Some items on the floor next to it as well (bottles and boxes).  One soda selection on the vend was out of order.  The Slush Puppy choices was out of order as well.  The booths had tears in the seating portion.

I really had high hopes for this burger joint but it fell short in my mind.  I think a good thorough cleaning of the store and a few repairs would help."}
{"text":"My Favorite place to enjoy a Burger and Soda!  Fries are delicious too, just the right amount of salty.  California Burger is my Favorite.  Just tried the Onion rings too, they are a salty, crunchy delight. As noted soda selection is huge.  The thousand island sauce on the regular burgers tastes zesty and fantastic!  Excellent experience here."}
{"text":"I tried Rocket Burger the other day and enjoyed it.  I can't say I will be back unless I find myself in the area though.  They serve a decent fast-food type burger at a fair price."}
{"text":"Great food. Simple yet unique ingredients. (Like fried pineapple ring on the Chicken Teriyaki Sandwich)

The New Yorker was great. Really good Slaw on a Pastrami and Swiss sandwich."}
{"text":"Burgers were awesomely awesome! I ordered the Philly double burger and the NY double burger. The burgers were very reasonably priced at $8 a burger. The burgers were humongo!!! The only down side were the fries. They were soggy. I had to place in oven and turn the broiler on for a moment to crisp them up a bit. This was a great place to pick up burgers."}
{"text":"Burger was delicious and fresh. Fries were well seasoned and crispy. Huge selection of bottled sodas from across the nation. Fun and good! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I was fixated on the Rocket \"Burger\" of Rocket Burger & Subs... so much so that for my first visit, I though I'd be doing an injustice if I didn't get a burger.

Truth is: what's special about Rocket Burger is 1) the bread and  2) the rocket sauce.

The burger itself... eh, just fine. 

And, yes, there's forty million sodas to choose from but if you're looking for \"diet,\" you'll be forced to choose pepsi.

Still: four stars because the bread is awesome! I can not wait to go back and get a sandwich! Chewy, but you're not going to break your jaw or cut the roof of your mouth on it. 

And, the rocket sauce puts other \"secret sauces\" to shame!

Bottom line: don't forget the \"subs\" at Rocket Burger!"}
{"text":"Grease Pit ... Oh  my gosh  the oil was so old when you left the  place you had that smell all over you ..   Place was filthy.  Didnt like the burger  and it was just cheese burger and Bacon and grilled onions   onions  were so over cooked  like it had been days of reheating ...  would i go back NOOOOOOO"}
{"text":"Great food, good portion sizes and decently priced! Cute little place would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Got the afterburner rocket burger (rocket burger has three patties on a sub bun) and added the ghost pepper cheese. It had this horseradish mayo and their signature relish that was a really good. 

This burger was worth the hype, granted it was 13 bucks it was really good and could be split with someone. The french fries and onion rings were just ok IMO.  

They had a crazy assortment of sodas, over 300 in the cooler alone with a soda shop next-door with 500+. 

Worth a visit and if come back. So many of their burgers on the menu looked appetizing it was hard to choose one"}
{"text":"Best fried zucchini and mushrooms I've had in I don't know how long! Location was unexpected but we had great burgers and unique sodas. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after looking at great reviews on Yelp. Divey place with very cool selection of sodas and quite a selection for burgers or subs. Ordered Bacon Ghost Pepper Cheese Burger, Fried Mushrooms, Philly Cheesesteak with Fries. The burger was great, not spicy at all. The Philly Cheesesteak, Fries and Fried Mushrooms were okay. Fast and friendly service. Will go here again and will try some of the sodas as well."}
{"text":"I have seen this place while on my way to work and have always wanted to go try it So I stopped by one day and it was probably one of the best tasting sandwiches I've had in quite a while. They are always Courteous, kind, and friendly. And they have a soda shop right next to it they had almost 600 different kinds of sodas it's really cool and fun. If they have a suggestion box I would suggest having a partyHave people pay $10 to get a soda taste test then they will know which ones they like."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun... my kids spent about 30 minutes just picking out their drinks!
Literally hundreds of different sodas! I settled on a Pecan Root Beer that was interesting and unique.  I had to, the brand name on it was \"Pappa Joe's\"

The food was good, not amazing, not \"WOW!\" but really good. The servers were friendly and nice and very patient with my kids.  The corn dog nuggets were the hit of dinner.

My kids picked a second soda and made them into floats for dessert... that was awesome (any of their drinks can be made into floats)

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love me a good burger and I was excited to check this place out.  Unfortunately their burger left me feeling queasy, it was just too much grease.  The service was friendly and I bought some tasty sodas but not enough to bring me back again."}
{"text":"Never Ending 

This describes the choices of food and drink here. 

On today's menu was a small toasted California Club and a Black Cherry sodee-pop. 

Don't let the sound of small fool you either, it is huge! Crammed packed with turkey, bacon, tomato and sprouts. This is a sub to try!

The staff including the owners are amazing. They have such a great selection of food and drink you can take your picky eating kid or a cranky grandad, both will find something to enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is a neat find! More then the usual burger shop, but hidden is a strip center. Not an impressive atmosphere but don't let that turn you away. The dining  area is surrounded by coolers full of unusual bottled beverages. Besides the bottled variety there is also a fountain full of other choices that that will please anyone that are included in your typical combo meal. I had one of the specials on the chalk board and I have to say it was one of the best burgers I have had in a while, pepper jack cheese and spicy mayo just made my mouth the happiest it's been for a while. There is plenty to look at while waiting for your burger to be served to you at your table. During your wait you can check out the beverage selection, and I will just say I have never seen such a great selection! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers!! Thin patties but the toppings make the burgers really good! Lots of options. The cheese curds are also good. Frys we're good but not crispy! Def a spot to return to! California and western burger were delicious"}
{"text":"5 for sure. I love this place. Found on Yelp. We are from Cleveland, Ohio & it's hard to find anything in Phoenix to fit our taste buds. Fortunately for us, we stumbled upon this place and decided to try it out. First off, I give them a 5 for customer service. They were so nice, helpful and accommodated to our every need. I am beyond picky. I ordered a gyro burger & I have to say it was one of the better gyro I've had. I also  ordered a plain hot dog but I  had to customize it with a few things just like I would back home (fries, bbq sauce & coleslaw) aka polish boy. And I'd have to say it was one of the best we've had. The coleslaw was perfect, bbq sauce was great & the fries, yummm. The only complaint I have is that I couldn't get a picture fast enough before we devoured our food.  We will definitely without a doubt be coming back.  Thank you so much Rocket burger for fulfilling our cravings."}
{"text":"Decided to drive a bit out of the my way to try Rocket Burger & Subs based on the \"Yelper\" reviews!!  This place is too clean for a \"Greasy or a Dive\" title, but there food reminds me of some of the BEST greasy/dives out there!  

They have a wide variety of food choices and there menu doesn't tell the whole story, so you may need to ask some questions.  When I looked through their burgers I noticed the \"Eddie Lopez\".  

To my surprise there is a better burger topping than bacon...  Hot Pastrami!!!  It was a mouth watering double burger that came with Hot Pastrami stacked on top of the two patties covered in melty-cheesy goodness, toppings and their thousand island dressing.  It was FANTASTIC!! 

We also had the \"sub of the day\" ~ the Big Dipper.  The roast beef was delicious and it had just the right amount of cheese.  Their au jus dipping sauce was not good, but the sandwich was superb.  Their Au jus did not have a beefy taste, it was too thin, too hot and did not set well on the pallet with this sandwich.

Their fries are fresh but a bit too greasy for our taste.  Will try to get them well done on our next visit or try their onion rings.  Their cheese curds were very good!

They do have one of the largest selections of soda, pop in a bottle.  It's fun to try a soda you've never heard about before like an imported micro brew root beer or cream soda!  (Both were very good BTW)

Rocket Burger & Subs, even though it will be extremely hard for me to consider ordering something other than the Eddie Lopez burger, I'm looking forward to my next visit, trying something else and plan to bring some friends with me. If you have not tried RB&S, they are a solid place to \"Book Mark\"!

Yelpers, what is your favorite Rocket Burger or Sub??"}
{"text":"There bugers are awesome! I got the new York burger it is amazing. With fried mushrooms you can't go wrong. I will drive across town for the burgers! The inside could use a revamp design wise. Don't think twice if your in the area you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Had the Cali burger. it was good. my wife had a pastrami sandwich. it had more coleslaw than pastrami, rather disappointing. soda selection was unbelievable, overall, it was middle of the road. staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Looking for a soda?  Rocket Burger had over 200 flavors. My fav is Faygo creme soda.
35th and Cactus behind Church's chicken."}
{"text":"Lots of retro sodas to choose from! Nice locally owed burger joint that also serves gyro's, and other sandwiches.  You gotta love a place that cuts their own spuds at least I do.  I had the cheeseburger special for 3.99 nice size patty, fries and a drink with free refills."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!!!! Now that was a great lunch. Found the location on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We were rewarded with a wonderful meal at an affordable price. I have driven by this location numerous times and truly never even thought twice about stopping by. Boy, had I been missing out. We knocked out the fish sandwich, the Cali burger, the chicken salad, and the best cheese curds I have ever had. Every item listed was awesome. The burger was huge, as was the salad. The fish sandwich was so tasty. The negative, the place is so far from my house. Love the food and the large variety of drinks to try. Who has ginger soda as a fountain drink? Yep, this place. And Shirley temple? Yep, this place. Oh and to top it off, 10% off by checking in on Yelp. A perfect experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Love little mom and pop places like this. Service was fast  and super friendly and he burger was so cool! Too many options for  bottled drinks, my head was spinning. Definitely my new burger joint"}
{"text":"Just a quick review of our first visit...

Bacon cheeseburger was really tasty, with several strips of crispy bacon on a golden bun. It may have been a bit heavy on the shredded lettuce, but that is easily fixed. The onion rings were crisp, a bit salty, and delicious!  The craft sodas and selection of bottled beverages is more than found in most grocery stores. If you have a favorite that isn't Coke or Pepsi, you can probably find it here."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their New York burger! It was a good size!  Tasted good! You have to upgrade for a meal but it's worth it so you can try the craft sodas. The ginger beer tastes just like ginger... It was \"interesting\". We tried all of the flavor in the machine because why not? The inside isn't anything special. It kind of reminds me of a cafeteria but the burgers are worth it! They are juicy and fresh! They also have a wide selection of  sodas!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place via Yelp. Again, my fellow Yelpers weren't wrong! This place was delicious. I had the Cali Burger and rings. The burger was good and better than I expected. Toppings were generous, meat was good quality and cooked right. The bun was very good....held the fixings In till the last bite, no \"bottom bun slippage\"!
Service was friendly and although I don't drink pop, the selection was ridiculous.....something for everyone!!

Rocket Burger, 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"I had the Gyro Burger - Amazing! Stellar! So much flavor... So much flavor... (I said that twice on purpose)

The cheese curds were out of this world... Perfectly breaded and gooey inside.

They have a massive selection of soda too. 

All around great experience!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! Did your sandwhiches just get bigger guys? Holy cow! yumm!!!!
Tamara"}
{"text":"Yum, just yum. Super cool place with great food. Check it out, you won't regret it. The staff is great, the drink selection is unbelievable, all different types of bottled soda. My favorite budget goes between the Sante Fe and the Philly"}
{"text":"What can I say if you are craving burger that's juice drips down to your elbows with great variety and flavor this is the place. I have been here 7 or 8 times always great. The fries are hit or miss in the crunch scale. Other than that small hiccup this place is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Had a so-called Philly cheese steak. I think it's the first one that's ever been made. Had to explain how to make it. Tasted strange. I believe I asked for onions and green peppers and I'll be darn if I could find them. The mustard had a strange taste to it also. The place was also unbearably hot inside. I guess they're saving on air-conditioning. Don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Came to Rocket Burger for take-out dinner, and the bbq pulled pork sandwich was absolutely delicious! By far one of the best burger places around!"}
{"text":"Perfect price, perfect service, and you can bet I'll eat here again! Had the Gyro Burger because it was on special, but I could not have picked a better start to this place. Made me realize there's more to burgers than some of the other places in the area. 

Fries were on point and everything on the menu seems amazing. I mean, mini corn dogs, really guys, thank you..Plus, any time you spend more than 10 minutes to decide what to drink, it's not really indecisiveness, it's exploration. I can almost guarantee that there's 30-40 that you've never even seen before.

It's no wonder it lead the charts while searching for a local burger joint..."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good; The staff was very friendly and super helpful. I watched them remake a burger that another customer ordered wrong no questions asked. Staff was great. They have a super fun selection of craft sodas which was fun to look through and try. Burger was average and nothing special. After that it starts to go down hill. The fryer and flat top are basically in the same space as the dining room so everything is covered in oil. The seats, the floor, the counter and so on you get the picture. Everything fried came out over done and with bits of everything else stuck in. Overall not a great experience we will not be back."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem and we absolutely love eating here! They have so many menu options as well as drinking options! It's a nice cozy restaurant with very friendly staff and the dining area is very clean! Highly recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"This place is great. 

Old School burger done well. 

Their bottled soda selection is insane. They had a Peoples Court soda! Wasn't sure I want to know how that one came about, but thought it was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Generally, I really like Rocket Burger and appreciate all the different sides and root beers available.  However, I feel it can be hit or miss at times depending on the staff.  Some days, they are very nice greeting patrons and the food is top quality (specifically the cheese curds).  But sometimes, for example, the staff acts annoyed that you are there, or 80% of the cheese curd basket is just a pile of nasty crumbs with no cheese, or the hogie bread (for a cheesesteak) is so stale that it must be days old.  I just think they need to work on their management and consistency.  If it's your first time, best to just stick to the standard burger and fries so that you have a good first experience."}
{"text":"Just so you know a bit about me, I will drive miles for a good burger. Lucky for me this place is close by and seriously delicious. So not only are the burgers good but there's like a thousand different bottles of soda to pick from. Holy memory lane batman, there were things I haven't seen in bottles since childhood. Good place to bring the fam too."}
{"text":"Great soda collection.. Its fun to try new flavors. Food was ok but nothing i really want to go back for."}
{"text":"Your Cali burger rocks, it's the best burger in town, when ever I'am really hungry I stop at this place and order the Cali rocket burger and that fills me up like nothing else, love this place, and your staff are always kind and very helpful. Thank you Rocket burger!!!!!!."}
{"text":"These guys know how to fry!  I had fried zucchini with a good cheeseburger. Terry had the fried chicken sandwich   The best he has ever had!

They have a huge wall of sodas!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with all the different sodas you can choose from. The ranch is great so order the fried mushrooms if you like them. The burgers are good too."}
{"text":"Best chicken sandwich! Little gem in the middle of a strip mall. Tons of old school sodas to choose from and really, really great food. Ask for ranch on the side if you order the chicken sandwich. Fries were cooked perfectly and the strawberry cream soda was heaven. I'd be a regular at this place if lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"What a great place!
Looks like an old convenience store and a perfect place for a huge burger and fries!
The soda selection is unique and expansive.  I really wanted to try three or four kinds!
The ghost pepper chicken sandwich was Amazing and the Chicago dog was on point!
This is a great place to stop if you are looking for a fantastic burger!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place based on the Yelp reviews. Bad decision! I honestly had to think twice about going in this place. It's not well lit in the parking lot and there were, in my opinion, unsavory people hanging around outside asking for change.

So, against my better judgement, I went in and was a bit confused at the theme/decor. I thought it was a liquor at first glance but quickly realized it was an assortment of craft sodas. They even have two types of self serve soda stations. One, with the typical sodas (Cherry Pepsi, Tropicana lemonade, etc) and the other had craft soda flavors like Shirley Temple, Black Cherry  and a few others. I filled my cup with the Shirley Temple...yum.

When you go to order, there was an older guy standing/waiting at the counter to take your order. Don't expect any suggestions, even after advising it was my first time there and that the sandwich menu was \"overwhelming \". It wasn't until I asked for a vegan option that he advised for an upcharge of $1, I could substitute a veggie pattie. I did. I ordered the California burger with the veggie pattie. It had Avocado, lettuce, tomato and something similar to a Comeback sauce which I got on the side.

$12+ later/lighter and I couldn't eat the fries because they were too hard, dry and old. The color tells me the grease should be changed. The burger  initially looked delicious, but I judged the book by its cover. The bun and lettuce was fresh, but the veggie pattie was dry and some parts were inedible. Long story short, I threw it all away. The best part of the meal was the craft soda .  My only regret is that I forgot to mention Yelp for a 10% discount.

Maybe if I ate beef I would have had a better experience, but that's no excuse for bad fries. It's sacrilege. Overpriced and disgusting! Buyer beware and take security."}
{"text":"Great cheesesteak, fries far better than average, craft soda, black cherry. I will return."}
{"text":"Another incredible experience at rocket burger. This is the ultimate dive spot! Food is amazing and like no other. Perfect comfort meal. It's a small quick place so you wouldn't expect the quality of food that comes out of here! I love the wall of the fun soda brands you can't find anywhere else. Always got to get me a sarsaparilla when I'm here! 

I love the philly cheese burger. Caramelized green peppers, onions with melted provolone cheese on top. My mouth is still watering!!  There fries are good too! They could be a little crisper but overall they still have a lot of flavor. We got a chilly cheese hot dog too that was very good. Good size hot dog. 

Highly recommend! Perfect place to take a friend, family, or even boyfriend/girlfriend for an amazing casual comforting meal.Thanks rockets! (:"}
{"text":"Good burgers, but the folks at the office and I like the sandwiches better.  The burgers are not spectacular, but better than McDonald's.  The soda selection is worth the trip and a burger itself.  I'd go back when I'm the mood for a neat choice of burgers or a sandwich, but not for a fantastic burger, I'd go to Zinburger for that!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good old fashioned  mom and pop burger joint Rocket's your place.  Cheap, delicious, fresh burgers and sammiches, crisp cut fries, friendly attentive service and a wall of assorted soda's that'll put any other in town to shame.  Rocket doesn't need to be flashy or have a big hook.  It's simple food done well.  If I lived a little closer this would be my default hangout."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place regularly for over a year now and the quality remains outstanding with phenomenal customer service. They have a huge selection of bottled soda and offer discounts for checking in on facebook. Well worth your business and better by far than any of your franchise burger joints."}
{"text":"Great lunch place with lots of options for a great burger, sandwich, hot dogs...And every soda possible!!!"}
{"text":"I love burgers there! I've only been there once because I don't live that close but I will definitely go there whenever I am in the neighborhood! I love burgers and if you love burgers then I bet that you will love this place. They really know how to make them!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband after craving a good burger and reading good reviews on yelp. We will certainly return! I ordered a cheeseburger which was prepared to order. The beef is never frozen, fresh angus beef. Cheeseburger is made with American cheese. I would have preferred cheddar which wasn't an option. Hubby got the Philly burger- an amazing burger to see piled high with meat and all the cheese steak fixings. I've read poor reviews about the fries- don't pass them up! Fries were perfectly cooked- crispy but not burnt with some softness in the middle. Seasoned to perfection. The owner took our order, he was very friendly and helpful. We bought 6 sodas (drank 1 each, took the rest home) out of amazement. The selection is like nothing I've ever seen. I think this place should be featured on a show like diners, drive ins and dives. The wall of sodas bottles for sale is enough to make a trip for, and the burgers are very tasty.  The sodas come from from every state, maker, flavor, etc you could ever imagine. Lots of nostalgic flavors and memories await you here. This would be a really fun place to go for fathers day or a birthday- a man cave for sure. Parking isn't great- its a hole in a wall place in a strip mall. Nothing fancy- just tasty, laid back. The perfect dive and tons of fun!!"}
{"text":"LOVE the local joints. Actually found this place on Yelp and was glad that we did. Ordered the pastrami burger and let me tell you, there is absolutely no comparing that masterpiece with anything else. The burger was completely delicious. It literally punched me in the mouth with flavor. We also got their philly and wow. Every ingredient was proportionate and made every bite damn near heaven. This place knows what a good meal is and the portions are completely adequate. Fries are completely legit. I can't believe I never knew of this place back in my high school days. Would have been a regular for sure."}
{"text":"Great burgers with many different choices. Lots of different sodas to choose from. The staff is helpful, informed, and good at their jobs. Will definitely be going back. The garlic burger is the best as well as the burger with the pastrami."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place forever.  It is just a little to far from my shop to go for lunch.  Recently I was driving down I17 and wanted a burger for lunch and remembered about this place and got off sooner than I normally would.  I got a cheeseburger combo with onion rings which came with a nice dipping sauce.  Pretty good burger.  Even with all those bottled sodas I just had the fountain drink that came with the combo.  It's fast casual, order at the counter and they bring it to you."}
{"text":"If you like avocado burgers, Cali burger is the way to go 5 out of 5. Pastrami lovers Eddie Lopez burger is for you 5 out of 5. The onion rings was good 4 out of 5, chili fries are the best chili fries I've taste since living in az 5 out of 5. Milk shake was great 5 out of 5"}
{"text":"such a fantastic little place! the chicken tender bites are SO good. I love the craft soda choices as well. the staff were all very friendly. my boyfriend got the gyro burger and said it was great as well. the prices are affordable. we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The name of the place is Rocket Burgers, yet somehow I got a sub. And let me tell you it was so dang delish!! It was the New Yorker loaded with Pastrami with homemade cole slaw swiss cheese and rocket burgers own sauce. OOOHHHH dang!! So delish!! I love a good pastrami sammie!  Their fries are delish as well.  But this place has over 300 different types of sodas, and even carries Dublin Dr Pepper, you might get a little over whelm on which soda to choose from but it's interesting to see the different types from all over. I settled on a frosty vanilla root beer and was not disappointed. Can't wait to come back and try out other sandwiches and burgers!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was very tasty. The service was fast. There is no exaggeration on the soda options. There must be over 100 different craft options. Very unique flavors such as pumpkin apple and snoozberry. Burgers were great and the fries are fresh."}
{"text":"This place is cool... Great burgers and fizzy drinks game is fucken on point... Great for quick burger fix!"}
{"text":"This place offers so many options! 
Walk in see a lot of sodas and interesting drinks to find in one place. The food is yummy. 
Owner is nice."}
{"text":"I'm never ordering a rocket burger again, was it bad?  No of course not, I got it with the intention of having half and saving the other half for later, instead I'm in a food coma because just couldn't stop pecking away. It literally took two hours to finish with fries on the side. Sure I could have had self control but just couldnt, was too good. Second time been there while visiting, will be back before leaving town. Fries are fresh cut as well, all around good stuff."}
{"text":"I was wary of trusting Yelp after the debacle of culinary excrement served to me at Wineburger, but Rocket Burger delivered the beefy goods. Great soda selection, friendly service, and the BURGER. Wow. I had the Baja Burger, and it packed an explosion of flavor. I made the mistake of getting a \"Rocket\" burger, which was too large for even me. After a while, I ditched the bun and went to town on the meaty goods. This is a place that knows how to season meat.

Rocket Burger, I shall return."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the area and decided to give Rocket Burger a try. When we first walked in we were pleased with the large variety of bottled sodas they have. We ordered the Baja burger and a Philly cheesesteak with some cheese curds. It was absolutely delicious and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best burger ever served on Cactus or in the northwest valley. Period . Great soda selection. Family friendly."}
{"text":"I can't believe I ate the whole burger! This place is a hidden gem. I have lived in the valley for over 15 years and have driven past this intersection many times. Recently a friend told me about the best hamburger he has ever had. I went to rocket burger not expecting anything but a regular hamburger. OMG was I wrong!! I had the chili burger and I could not believe how good it was. I will definitely be back. Thank you Rocket burger for this wonderful food!"}
{"text":"absolutely loved the food....I got the ghost pepper burger and oh man....so good...forgot what my husband got....I think it was called \"after burner\" he loved it 

So many options for sodas it was amazing. Owner and staff are super friendly and will recommend things for you to try. 

I cant wait to go back and try something new....definitely worth it! 

Try the ginger/vanilla root beer....oooohh myyy goooddd! You wont regret it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their crispy chicken salad! The chicken pieces are moist, delicious and flavorful.  The portion size is more than generous and it's just plain beautiful. If I can post a picture I will so you can see for yourself."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, good fries, so many soda they even have mini corn dogs  a huge menu.  can always find something to eat."}
{"text":"Ok.. Yummmmmmmmmmm 

Positives:
Best cheese curds ever. Amazing seasoning on their fries and the California burger was bomb. Not our usual area of town but hubby wanted to check it out and I am so glad we did!  Anyone looking for a phenomenal burger you must give it a try. 

Negatives:
The location isn't great for me. 

I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch on a work day.  Friendly place, they weren't busy so the service was pretty quick.  Had a burger combo, really enjoyed the fries.  Should have had a double on the burger though.  If I'm in the area I'll eat there but I don't think it's going to be one of my \"usuals\"."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Definitely my go to burger and fries place when I'm in need of a 5 star meal.  Prices are super reasonable, service is friendly enough, and they have an array of sodas from which to choose.  I've tried maybe 5 different burgers/sandwiches, and they've all been amazing.  

Go out of your way to come here."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for lunch today looking for a hotdog. I got the chili cheese dog and cheese curds. Everything was mediocre at best. The curds are super greasy, more than could be enjoyed, and the chili wasn't the best. Maybe the burgers and sandwiches are better."}
{"text":"Excellent service, tasty burgers of all kinds, and best soda selection I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Solid food and service! I had the double NY burger, and the pastrami coleslaw combo was messy but delicious.  The fries aren't the best, but I'm looking forward to trying the other sides in the future."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!!! I wish they would extend their hours a bit. Who closes up during late dinner rush times? Silly. Still worth making sure you get there early enough though because yuuuum."}
{"text":"I had the Chicago Burger. It was a nice,combination of cucumbers, jalapenos, and mustard. The fries were good and the onion rings we 're delicious. We 2njoyed browsing through their sodas. The atmosphere was casual. It was slightly cramped because we had a stroller. The staff was life and friendly. The best hamburger place we found in Phoenix, it was recommended by our family and they were right. It was great."}
{"text":"3 month update! I live right next to this place, so I have been coming in occasionally and have been consistently impressed by the service and the food.

The staff are usually friendly, quirky, and fun individuals. Food always comes out hot and fast. Sandwiches and burgers are good, onion rings are great, fries are pretty good too.

I'm not a soda person, but if I were, they have a massive collection of craft sodas and root beer.

Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were heading to the Glendale drive-in and I felt like having a hamburger in the west valley so I looked on yelp and found this place. it is definitely unique with all their soda selections but I can't speak highly of the food nor can I speak negatively it's just a regular burger. the burger was fine but it was nothing that I would drive all the way from Eastvalley to the West Valley to have. The fries were good. One thing I did not appreciate about the place was the guy behind the wall who was cooking (manager or owner) was really micromanaging the people up front. I was just waiting there until they had a moment but he was like you need to help, you need help and he was just kind of rude to his employees. They were helping and he was just making a scene. that was a turnoff for me and I probably won't return because of that."}
{"text":"We ate here last week. A surprising gem! The burgers were very good. I had the gyro double. Too much food. But sooo good. The corn dogs were delicious as well. Definitely hand made. I also being able to pick some wild and crazy sodas. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I have forgotten to review Rocket Burger?! I'm such a bad customer, because I love this place and feel everyone should try them out. I've had:

California Club
The New Yorker -yum!
BBQ pulled pork- even good straight out of the fridge next day with no warm up!
Regular burger
Some special burger they did on Memorial Day with the Rocket Relish- so good and spicy!
Fries
Cheese curds- never had these before, and I really like them now
Chili cheese fries
Brownie

So anyhow... I've been there a time or 6. Good food, great prices, friendly service. Definite go-to spot when I'm around the area"}
{"text":"Yummy little dive in a strip mall. We got takeout from here- French dip sandwich, pastrami, and fried zucchini. It was yummy but wish the zucchini was cut in strips instead of rounds. They have every kind of soda you can think of so that's pretty cool as well."}
{"text":"Update: the suite next door has been opened by Rocket Burger as Pop The Soda Shop and they have an even larger selection of sodas now!"}
{"text":"Great food and freash. Got the fish sandwich and it was huge. Could have used a sub roll instead of the bun and needed a few more condiments but other than that was good."}
{"text":"WOW!! Amazing food and great Customer service.. just brought my husband here, we just moved here and read such great reviews, he actually decided to go here instead if a big restaurant for hia fathers day lunch. WE ARE SO GLAD WE DID. It's a hidden gem, so delicious. I order the Mexican coleslaw fish sandwich and onion rings, my Hubby got the new New York burger with fried zucchini. And our son had the mini corn dogs.. everything was sooo good.. even down to the little mini  corn dog. The onion rings were so amazing and their ranch you can tell is homemade. My husband lived his New York pastrami, and the zucchini was fried to perfection. We will definitely be back to this spot. Don't let the outside fool u. It's hidden in a tiny little old shopping center.. but you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Try it, you'll love it. Good food and great selection of bottled soda (about $2.50 each). You can make any drink into a float by adding $1. The owner actually helps out & chatted with us a bit. It's always fun to learn the history & passion of how an eatery came to be. Try Ghost Cheese Pepper on your burger or sandwich. They also accommodate for those who are on a low carb diet & want to omit the bread, they replace it with extra lettuce or coleslaw."}
{"text":"holy crap, best burger alive!!  why have i not been to this place until today!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Phoenix no question! Same with the slush puppy. The service is great we got our burgers (4) in less than 5 minutes! They have over 1000 types of bottled sodas. This place is amazing"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had (Philly cheesesteak burger). Add a pumpkin pie soda and BAM, awesome lunch!"}
{"text":"I can't seem to figure out how this place has such good reviews when the restaurant is filthy dirty.  The walls and ceilings were so dirty along with the grease and mess by the soda machines...I will admit that the burgers are good - the Chicago burger looked super fresh and yummy but the cheese curds were crazy salty.  The soda selection is huge and was fun to look at, but there was literally some homeless guy shooting heroin in the bathroom and the dust and grease on the walls and ceilings is so super gross.  I guess if you're coming here, get the food to go!!"}
{"text":"'There is no way we are going to finish all of this' 

This is what we told ourselves we stared at the sizable amount of food placed in front of us.  What possessed us to order two double cheeseburgers, fries AND onion rings?  We wanted them. That is why. 

I can see how easy it is to over-order at Rocket Burger. Everything looks good. Cheese fries with real cheese? Yes! Rocket (onion) Rings that magically and mysteriously aren't greasy? Yes! Tender, juicy burgers with lots o' cheese? Yes, Yes, Yes! 

Rocket Burger isn't fancy. It isn't a 'dress to impress' destination. In fact, it appears that maybe once upon a time it was a convenience store. Coolers line one wall containing a fascinating assortment of beverages, including one whole section dedicated to root beer, and one drink the owner admits tastes like 'tree'. Really, tree. If you can't find it here, it probably doesn't exist! 

The charm in Rocket Burger is that it isn't trying to be something it is not. In fact, you can see the whole open kitchen area behind the counter/cash register. It is simply good food, prepared and served by friendly owners and staff. 

Oh and yes, we ate it all. :)"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. They pull out the fresh beef and throw in down on the flat top right in front of you. Everything is fresh, I ordered take out and they even cut a corner section out of my French fry \"to go\" container for it to air out on the way home and not be soggy! Genius! Everything about the place is authentic. So yummy. Can't wait to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I am grime El Paso, TX. I traveled to Phoenix for the weekend to visit my son. Looked up burger places and this business came up. Well gotta say it was better than what I thought! The New York burger was delicious and definitely coming back.  They also have a variety of sodas and pop to choose from. Great little business in AZ."}
{"text":"How can I be craving a Rocket Burger Reuben and I have only had 3 in my life? That is how delish this place is! Went there for carryout today. The owners are super nice, as usual. When I got home, mu food was piping hot and YUMMY! I hope everyone in the Northern Phx area begins frequenting this semi hidden gem. The food is excellent and affordable and the service is the best!"}
{"text":"Some the best burgers i have had in a long time. The BLT was great lots of favor, very big had cut it in half."}
{"text":"Rocket Burger is totally out of this world!  This place blasted into my universe about a year ago and I have been coming in for frequent landings ever since.  Rocket has arguably the best burger in Universe! I bet the astronauts on all of those Apollo missions and up on the space station wish they had it this good.  

Steve and Denis, the owners, are both really nice guys. \"Fresh is where it's at\" at Rocket Burger and they have over 300 sodas in stock! But hey, don't take my word for it. Let's hear what the Steve and Denis have to say...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MqQQvX0Ock

Gotta love that commercial. I wish it played on local TV. 

I'm telling you this place is seriously really great. I always go with a bacon double cheeseburger, with pickles, onions, jalapenos, and man oh man that Rocket Sauce. I think I could drink it! Good thing I don't though. Check out my picture from this place. I mean seriously, how good does that look?!? I also recommend getting a side of their ranch for your fries. I know, I'm sounding like a total health nut right now, but bear with me. I think this place would be a perfect candidate for Diners, Drive Ins, & Dives.

It's T minus 10 and counting until I get in my car and blast off to Rocket Burger and Subs. I'm sure the burger and fries will have another great landing in my belly.

Get Your Rocket On!"}
{"text":"This place was definitely worth the hype. Just the variety of vintage sodas they have is enough to warrant five stars from me. For a small fee they will make any soda you choose into a float. The food was great as well. I had a double Afterburn which had two patties, jalapeños, and horseradish sauce and an order of their cheese curds. I will definitely be back soon to try some of their other burgers and subs as well as the multitude of soda they have."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall has delicious sandwiches! They have a huge collection of old school sodas and you can turn any one into a float."}
{"text":"Awesome place bring stretchy pants you're going to need them .., food is that good., an insane amount of sodas to choose my family loves this place"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is great and they have just about any soda you could want and the fries are killer. Im lucky that this place is so close to where I live that I can eat there just about anytime I want. I still cant decide what burger is better the Teriyaki Burger, Philly Burger, or the New York Burger. They are all so good."}
{"text":"Burgers are great.  My choice has always been a top notch burger.  My girlfriend's hasn't been so lucky.  The coleslaw is sometimes too runny and it left a pool at the bottom of her burger container.  The sauce is pretty thick, but I'm always a no sauce guy.  The place is cheap enough to try out burgers regularly though.  Can't wait to try one rocket style."}
{"text":"Great spot for a fantastic burger, sub or even hotdog!! Lots of bottled drinks to choose from. For a quick and easy lunch spot, this is our go to!!! 

Rocket sauce makes everything better!!!"}
{"text":"I've actually visited Rocket Burger for several times already. One word that I can describe their service is it is CONSISTENTLY GOOD. I've tried other burger joints but they simply don't get it that when I say \"well done\", I mean \"well done\". 

Anyway, my fave is their Bacon Cheeseburger and their Philly Burger (hey, I'm a burger guy!). Meat is fresh and is cooked very well. The cheese properly melted making every bite a sumptuous rush. Will be back for more my friends!"}
{"text":"It's ok.  Not really sure what the hype is all about.  Italian sub was mediocre with, what I feel, was way too thickly sliced meat.  The burger was ok.  The best part was soda fountain and customer service.  Everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Gave it a try because of the positive Yelp reviews. Glad I did!  Delish!!  We had the Italian Classic & a Ruben on rye with fries. It was all very tasty!  Tons of bottled soda to choose from!!"}
{"text":"After reading yelp reviews of this place I decided to swing by and try it out. I got the California burger and it wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but it was pretty good. It was pretty neat seeing all the different sodas, I hadn't had a jones soda in so long so they get points for that. 

It was good enough that I'll be back to try them again eventually, just not anything to drive out of the way for anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a cool little hidden cheeseburger shop. I got bacon cheeseburger l with fries. I got the double and, I could've honestly went without the fries. It was a lot of food. Fries were kind of dry for my personal liking, but I'm sure if you get some rocket sauce to go with them...they'd be lit. They had a ton of craft soda. They have craft soda bottled and in multiple fountain machine choices. Added an extra star just because if the price. My $11 dollar total meal would've been $16 anywhere else. 

I'll be back for sure. The young crew up front was able to answer all of my questions and refer things. A+ for customer service."}
{"text":"Awesome handcrafted Burgers . Bun was soft sweet and held until last bite . Burger was juicy and toppings fresh . Craft sodas and properly made homemade fries !"}
{"text":"The owners and crew at Rocket are some of the hardest workers. The food is fresh not frozen and good. We always get a six pack of soda togo because they have so many unique kinds. The daily specials get us to make the drive down to visit them."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating here 2 times so far.  They have a wide variety of yummy sandwiches, burgers and hot dogs! There is a nice park close by and could turn into an easy picnic. They also have a huge collection of different sodas from around the world."}
{"text":"I usually get the gyro but the bread I think is old due to the bread falls apart and they fries  have a bit  to be desired"}
{"text":"This was place was delicious. Now, I won't say it was the best food I ever had or anything but it was delicious. I ordered the Philly cheesesteak with fried mushrooms. The cheesesteak was pretty damn tasty. It wasn't as stuffed as I've seen others but the flavor was definitely there. The mushrooms were also good. For the drink, I got a bottle of root beer from their refrigerators. Here's where rocket burger shines: their selection of sodas and drinks is ridiculous. One door is nothing but root beer. (And I love root beer) I got a salted Carmel one that was alright, but just the fact that I can choose from so many was nice. The looks? Well the place isn't fancy, so don't expect to be wowed by appearances. The place is a little pricey than fast food, so expect to spend 10 to 15 bucks when you go. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and sandwiches with hundreds of crazy soda choices . We tried the New York burger !!! Omg great !! We tried the California club !!omg great !! We had double cheeseburgers !! It was great ! The onion rings were excellent and fries good ! So many other burger combos I would love to try ! 100's of soda options from all over !! This place is fantastic !!"}
{"text":"Rocket Burger is the best burger in Glendale. Maybe all of Phoenix. The burgers are delicious with their special, handmade sauce and the fries are the greasy, delicious fries everyone in America loves. I'm not big on sandwiches or hot dogs from anywhere so I'm not judging them on that, but the burgers are enough to give these guys 5 stars all on their own."}
{"text":"I think this may become one of my favorite places to come for a quick and delicious meal. From the outside of the building, it doesn't look as though it would offer anything that great, but this place is amazing! From the service to the food, everything was awesome. 

=Food=
This restaurant has a large variety of items on their menu from burgers, Rocket dogs, subs, sandwiches, mini corn dogs, salads, fries, onion rings, and so much more. I was interested in a spicy chicken sandwich, but they didn't offer anything close to what I was looking for so I got the Gyro combo meal which came with a side of fries and a drink and cost $7.29. A great price for the quality of food I received. The Gyro was stuffed full of tender meat that was well flavored and cooked to perfection. The sauce was good, but not as \"authentic\" tasting as I've had while I was in Europe. The side of fries was very generous and was well cooked. My guest got the Bacon Cheeseburger combo and upgraded his fries to chili cheese fries which cost $10 total. He said the Bacon Cheeseburger single was more than enough for him, so was thankful not to have gotten the double. The burger was nicely cooked and well flavored. The chili cheese fries were a whole serving and not the side size, so it was more than enough to feed two people. Fries were covered in lots of chili and cheese. They are more than generous with their portions and definitely don't hold back on toppings. Both combos came with a drink. 

=Service=
The girl Alexis that took our order was very friendly. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave suggestions when I asked about certain items that they may have or be able to add to my meal. She took our order and repeated it to us to make sure she had gotten our order correct. I do like that about a food place! We waited around 10 minutes for our food to come out as there were several large families ahead of us, but when our food came out, the server was very polite and asked if we needed anything extra like BBQ sauce or Ranch. Told us to let them know if they could help us out at any point during our meal. 

Everything here was awesome and I'll definitely be back again to try other items on their menu. The only complaint would be the parking situation. They don't have many parking spaces, so some people had to park over in the next restaurant's parking lot."}
{"text":"Over a year later and still great. Went in on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch and got the California burger (sans tomatoes and pickles). The avocado was fresh, the bun wasn't dry, and their \"secret\" sauce was still perfectly peppery and went great with the avocado and cheese. It's also one of the only places to get a lot of the soda they have on offer and today I chose a vanilla root beer from Barrel Brothers.

It seems that they bought most of the mini-mall they're in so there's more parking and will soon be a lot more seating. Good for them!"}
{"text":"The food is too greasy for me. But, I love stopping  by because of the huge selection of soda. This is the only place in the valley I know of where I can get Ale-8-One, reminds me of my time in the south living in Tennessee and Georgia. There are tons of different and hard to find drinks. This place also has real slush puppies."}
{"text":"An old classmate of mine, that comes here regularly, highly recommended this place.  It definitely doesn't disappoint.  I didn't try the burgers but the fish sandwich I ordered was great.  It was dressed with a pico de gallo slaw.  You won't go away hungry with this dish or any dish probably.  And, they have a throw back to classic sodas...that was cool.  It appears that they own/operate the Pop shop next door too; which houses even more soda...nice overall throw back feel.  The place has about 8-10 tables, so it can easily seat about 40 people.  I believe it's a family run place and they are all friendly.  I can parking will be an issue if the have a full house, just plan to going during less busy times and/or order to go. I will definitely be back whether dine in or take out... ;p"}
{"text":"WOW.  
Trust me when I say This place is the only place to go for a burger!  If you like onion rings some of the best.  Let's not talk about their Fried Zucchini or their Ranch Dressing because they are just as good.  Oh and did I forget to say that everything is made from scratch.  Another place to put on your bucket list!"}
{"text":"This place is REDIC!!!!
Love the food ate the afterburner burger.
Service was great lots of help and the food was on our table in minutes. Lots of choices would comeback again for sure."}
{"text":"Best teriyaki burger I've ever had! Great tasting fries and fried zucchini. A hole in the wall place, looks like it used to be a convenience store, but such a fun little eatery. Soda selection is unique,  we bought 4 different ones to try at home. The owner is a sweet Filipino lady and so fun to talk to! I support you, rocket burger. We will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here. Burgers are great,subs,dogs and salads plus all the soda choices. My favorite is the NY burger,the pastrami and slaw make this burger really good. Today the slaw dog is still the special so I had it...again.big beef hot dog with slaw and pastrami,side of onion rings,which are also very good!"}
{"text":"Yo. I've never stopped here before today, and now I'm kicking myself. The burgers are top notch, and they have a huge selection of bottled novelty sodas that are only $1.99 each. Finding my favorite soda from MI was a treat.

The cheese curds were pretty underwhelming, but the fries were solid. The burgers are served on a fluffy but substantial bun, and cooked perfectly. Service was prompt and friendly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always a fun time here! Food is great and cheap definitely come here if you live close and if you don't then make the drive!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Everything is home made, hand breaded and cooked just for you. We had burgers and fries, cheese curds, chicken sandwich and chili fries. Everything was great. The owner was super friendly and said we should try the fish sandwich voted top 10 in Phx. The really great surprise when you get there is allll the soda selections. Gourmet sodas and craft fountain sodas. Yum."}
{"text":"Price is decent, I do feel like the place is way over hyped. The burgers are good but not good enough to travel all the way to chandler from West Phoenix. 
The pace is small which makes it a bit awkward, because when one gets up, lot of people stare... 

My conclusion was that people love coming here because they have a great selection of sodas, from cream sodas to citrus sodas. Sodas from all over the country."}
{"text":"They have a really expansive burger menu but are way too expensive for what you get. The quality is lacking and next time I'll go to in and out. I really wanted to like this place too"}
{"text":"Salad at a burger place usually a disappointment but not here. Their Greek salad is to die for. It is loaded and I mean loaded with tons of goodies like larger slices carrots, shredded purple cabbage huge radishes, bell peppers, onions olives galore and. Wet fresh crisp lettuce. I will recommend this salad to all my friends and family. I am a Vegan and so happy I found a yummy salad worth every penny."}
{"text":"Rocket Subs & More opened about three weeks ago. It's hidden away in the Church's Chicken plaza at 35th avenue and Cactus. The boy and I were on our way to another sub shop today when we drove by this sub place, we made a quick executive decision to go here instead and pulled in.

Walking in, there's the counter to order on your right, seating to the left, and cases of sodas and beverages along the back wall, with shelving for chips, corn nuts, etc. After some brief decision making, we decided to order a Rocket Dog combo meal (easy on the mustard and ketchup, with onions), and a Country Club sub, toasted.

Combo meals here are awesome, you get chips or fries and a drink from their first case (cans of your everyday soda brands), for a dollar more, you can select a soda or drink from one of the other cases - and that is where the fun begins. They had TONS of different brands and flavors of sodas to choose from. I chose a Mason's root beer in a super cute glass bottle, and the boy chose Pepsi (boo - boring choice!).

It took less than 5 minutes for our food to be brought out to us. The sub? Amazingly toasted goodness - eat your heart out, Quizno's! My hot dog and fries were also awesome. The fries were well seasoned and crunchy, the hot dog made perfectly to order. :)

The owner swung by our table and asked how everything was (awesome, thanks!) and he also shared that starting next week they will be serving hamburgers and cheeseburgers.

Overall, the food was awesome, the selection of drinks was great, and we will be back for more.

Last, but certainly not least - the price? Great! For two sodas, a huge sub, a hot dog, and a giant side of fries it came to $11.00! :) 

Before leaving we also took some sodas for the road (Captain Eli's Ginger Beer, anyone?)"}
{"text":"The burgers here are OK. Went in with extremely high expectations (I have those with any restaurant that is rated 4 1/2 stars) and I was disappointed by the very salty, greasy, and overly sauced burger/fries. I couldn't even finish my food. I get why soda fanatics love the variety, but the food is not the kind that has me coming back by any means. Although, I do have to say the cheese curds and customer service are great."}
{"text":"Love this place! Was so excited to see this pop up in the East Valley after years of making the trek to the west side. Friendly staff, amazing burgers, and an iconic wall of glass soda bottles. Try the California burger and the craft soda ginger beer!"}
{"text":"I had the \"Afterburner\"... It was really fresh and really good. I wasn't real crazy about the horse radish on it, but that's just me. The chicken was awesome. My daughters had the Gyro burger. I sniped a taste, it was exceptionally good. They have an absurd variety of sodas... including Jones and Jolt -two of my childhood favorites. My bill with those three combos was a little over $27. I don't ever give 5 stars so this was as good as it gets. 4 stars."}
{"text":"It's hard to not give this a five and I may just end up doing so just to frustrate people that hate seeing perfect scores: Seriously I was skeptical but after what seems like a streak of  3 star reviews I finally have something good to report on the end of the food chain I can speak to:) 

Is it the best chili cheese dog I've had? No.The best  chilli-cheese fries? No.Most extensive selection of sodas? Again no but truly this place adds up to more than the sum of its parts.It has nearly the best of all three  in one friendly, clean place that I'm looking forward to returning to. 

Their Chili-cheese dog takes Sonic's to school and steals its lunch money. The texture of  fine ground meat  / amount makes it easy enough to eat and theirs actually has flavor in the chilli, you know  unlike every chain that tries to sell you the same thing. 

When added to cheese and the  fries it was really great  though my preference is for fatter fries this was a great portion for the money.  

Wife's  bare lettuce and meat burger was tasty with maybe a slightly enthusiastic shake of the seasonings  but to be fair if it was a fully dressed burger I bet it would be hard to tell.

Kid's Cheese burger ,oh yes, very very good and hopefully he appreciates now why we keep him away from that clown. 
  
Really the choice is great, the soda's great,  friendly people that ask, and really seem to care, if you liked the food give this a 4.5   rounded to five."}
{"text":"I for one, fail to see the allure of this place.  The reviews way oversell the food.  The fries are over cooked, the grilled onions that were on my sandwich were awful.  The onions tasted like they were accompanied by the scrapings off the grill.  I wouldn't send people here and the only reason I would consider returning is to try one of their speciality burgers that don't involve onions.  Yuck.

They do have ALOT of sodas to choose from to wash down the grill garbage."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The fries are awesome and the people are sweeeet! Try the double gyro burger. Dare you to finish it in one sitting."}
{"text":"I would say this is just an average burger place.  They do have lots of delicious soda to choose from but just an okay burger joint!"}
{"text":"Wowza!  This place is AMAZING!  Thanks to Paul V. I was able to try Rocket Burger many times and every time has been fantastic.  I had the Bacon double cheeseburger  with fries or cheese curds and it's so delicious.  The burger is greasy, cheesy, and has lots of bacon.  Ya can't go wrong!  The french fries are also good, especially the cheese fries.   
Paul has ordered take out from here for me quite often as well.  The cheese curds get a bit mushy if not eaten right away so go with french fries if you have take out.  

Whether you eat in or get take out the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Rocket Burger's restaurant setup is far from trendy, especially in comparison to all of the other burger places that keep popping up all over the city. But don't let this fool you. Rocket Burger offers an above average burger, including some unique creations that might be somewhat intimidating to try at first.  

Everything I've tried has been good, but not quite as alarmingly great as some people describe. Additionally, both their regular seasoned and cheese fries are also worth trying when paying a visit.

The cool thing about Rocket Burger is their massive variety of sodas! They carry many of my favorite brands, including Boylan and Jones, as well as many obscure flavors that you probably won't find anywhere else in Phoenix.

Very cool place that I recommend trying!"}
{"text":"Oooooh...

I was a little apprehensive about Rocket. Their vegetarian selection did not look promising. No veggie burger? What?!

We ordered the mushrooms and zucchini to start. Oh-em-geeee! These were home made morsels of joy with a mouthwatering, well seasoned batter. 

I ordered a veggie sub and everyone else ordered a burger. The burgers were raved about with every bite. My veggie sub on the other hand? Just so-so. The bread was really good and the quality and variety of veggies was good. Something just didn't work though... I think it didn't have enough mustard/ mayo/ sauce/ dressing. It needed something. And more cheese probably.

We also had fries and cheese curds on the side. Fries were fresh, not frozen. Yay! Cheese curds were tasty.

Soda wall was a bit insane. I'm not a soda person. I was getting a toothache just looking at this wall. I would prefer a beer wall..."}
{"text":"Stumbled across the lil gem. Classic sodas, great burgers and the best fried mushrooms. Good for pickup or dining in. I got Philly Cheese steak and chili fries."}
{"text":"First time here today. As awesome as I had hoped! Total hole in the wall place in phoenix, but definitely worth the drive if you aren't close. Lots and lots of burgers and subs to choose from.
I had a double new york burger, and it was everything I wanted it to be. Greasy, meaty, cheesy. Root beer and fries? Yes please. Plus a six pack of assorted premium not-from-this-world sodas to take home.
I miss pop the soda shop, as it was so close to where I lived. Same sodas here for the most part, plus...burgers. It's a bit of a drive, but worth it. 

I'll be back. GET IN DA ROCKET BURGER YEEAARRRGGGHHH!!!
Give me your clothes, your boots, and your rocket sauce. 

I'm gonna go watch T2 and enjoy my dogs and suds root beer now."}
{"text":"I was in the area and starving.  Read the reviews and this place was spot on.  It's got that soda shop feel with classic big burgers.   I went with the bacon one and it did not disappoint.  It's off the roadway but worth the stop.  Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Best BURGERS and sides on three planet! All scratch made at a great price! Get a soda float AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Low prices and great food. Fast service.... definitely one of my favorite places! AMAZING selection of indie sodas!"}
{"text":"I was craving a Chicago dog and my husband wanted a burger. Found this gem!!! My husband loved the California burger and I loved their Chicago dog. They even toast your buns!!!! The owner was super nice too, can't wait to go back and try more! Draft sodas were a nice touch."}
{"text":"This place is awesome looks like a liquor store when u come in but it has tables n a lot of different bottled sodas n pops.! The menu is great so much to choose from, my meal was great i got the philly cheese steak with onion rings n my kids got the chicken bites kids meal n cheese curds are yuuummmm.! Imma come bak to trybthe rest of the menu specially the gyro burger ohh holly molly it looked great."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding!! Burgers are fantastic, huge boutique soda selection, soft serve ice cream with owners that are friendly and happy to provide great service and food!! I will be back as often as I can!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!! This place is amazing!! I was out on this side of town and always like to try new places and found this on Google maps and thought I'd give it a try and so glad I did!! Ordered a double garlic melt and it was fricking delicious!! They have so many different choices.. Chicago burger, California burger, chili and the list goes on!! can't wait to go again!! I took my order to go and my box of fries had even been vented to allow the steam not to sog up the fries which yes they are awesome too!! The people working there are so very nice and it was just such a great experience all around!! Remember this is not just a burger joint they offer sandwiches and salads I saw on the menu board too!! Yep worth the trip to eat here!!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place the service. The people were very kind! This place has decent portions, but the food was not tasty. That's why I rated them so low. Their fries were the best thing there, but even those were way too greasy. The spread on their burgers tasted awful like coleslaw - like if they were trying to copy the In-N-Out spread. Epic fail! My visit here was not very pleasant either seeing as how they weren't very cleanly and the floors were very slippery. They were out of cheese curds, straws and Dr. Pepper - The only soda I will drink. Supposedly they're known for having \"the biggest soda selection in Phoenix.\" Don't make me laugh. The setup is very outdated too, and not in a cute way. It's cold and hard with bright lights - very sad in there."}
{"text":"My reasoning for checking out Rocket Burger is kind of weird but I'm glad it got me through the door.  One of my friends from Ohio always talks about Faygo soda and when I saw that in one of the pictures for Rocket Burger I knew I had to go for that and then after seeing all the great reviews I was excited about the food too.

Had a little trouble trying to find it at first so for everyone trying to find it for the first time, it's on the South West corner of Cactus and 35th Ave.  You probably won't see it from the street but there's a Church's Chicken right in front of it so just pull into that parking lot and Rocket Burger is right behind it.

I got the Single Bacon Cheeseburger with fries and a Faygo soda (of course!).  The guy at the counter was nice and polite but not overly friendly.  The food came out very quickly, probably under 5 minutes and it was nice and hot.  The burger was good, they really stack it with the toppings too and you can tell they're quality.  No soggy veggies and limp bacon here.  I loved the fries too!  They're shoestring and they're coated with some kind of seasoning salt that gives them a great flavor.  So glad that my quest for soda helped me discover a great burger place too!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have amazing food with a HUGE selection of bottled sodas. I have not yet had anything that I didn't like. Awesome burgers and subs!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 2 times  and both times the burgers were great.  I tryed the cali burger and the eddie lopez burger both were great.  The fryed zucchini and mushrooms are very good.  The food  is fresh and priced  right, service is perfect.i called and food was ready for pickup when i  got there.   If you want a good burger. This is the place to go."}
{"text":"Went to Rocket Burger tonight and Jesse ( not sure if that's his correct spelling) but the last few times we were in he waited in us and he's always very friendly and really knows the menu well! Great place, great food, you never have to wait long for your food to arrive! The only thing is the hamburger buns do tend to fall apart while your eating, but otherwise you won't be disappointed stopping in here to eat!"}
{"text":"Burger was good, but the size of the bun is a bit to much for a single. The fries were very tasty, seasoned to perfection. Great selection of Soda's and a good variety of items on the menu. Seating was a bit limited. Overall a cool little place to have a quick bite."}
{"text":"We came here during my Winter Break and this place looks creepy from the outside, but once you are inside it's like \"WOW\"  they have so many types of soda like 300's from all over the world.  That was my boyfriends favorite part, who knows how many he drank. LOL.  We ordered burgers and we were very satisfied, can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Awesome Burger joint. The best soda varieties in town!!! All the employees were fast and efficient."}
{"text":"I will travel for a delicious burger. So why the eff did I not know about this place that I can effing walk to? Seriously?! First thing, when you walk in, you're overwhelmed by all of the yummy soda. I mean there is stuff here that your parents grew up with. Jolt cola? Yummo! Espresso cola? Why yes please, butterscotch root beer? Omg yum. And here's a fun fact, you can make ANY OF THEM  a float! Sold! Next thing is the burgers. The bun is effing delicious. So not only is this burger giant, but the bun will not fall apart. I'm not sure if they are made in house, but who cares! Lastly the fries. Oh god. Fresh potato fries that are cooked to perfection. This is a great place to have a cheat meal, plus they are very quick with the cooking and delivery to your table. This place is a KEEPER!"}
{"text":"Came with my kids and they digged the burgers they got, not so much the fries. I got the chili burger and zucchini fries and it was real good! Atmosphere is fun with the soda bottles for sale in the area, its a small establishment you'll miss it driving by. We'll be back for sure to try a new burger off their menu!!"}
{"text":"Super nice people. We order three kids cheeseburger meals, two doubles cheeseburgers? meals, a Santa Fe meal and cheese curds. Great price!"}
{"text":"Greasy burgers, but they are so good. Reminds me of Bob's Burgers a bit. If you're a fan of soda, hit this place up -- they honestly have about 100 different choices of soda!"}
{"text":"Skip the In n Out down the street and come here instead. Seriously. Top quality burgers that you actually want and leave you satisfied. Philly is ALWAYS the go to. Even though it's not a \"true\" cheesesteak, the flavors are still there, and is amazing in its own right. Excellent soda selections with some unique and bizarre flavors. Haven't found a better place to get burgers. Mini corn dogs are also a great option. 

In all honesty, this place is so good my girlfriend and I splurged and binged WAAAAY too hard and came here 4 days in a row to try different things . Would not recommend doing what we did unless you're ready to run your ass off afterwards."}
{"text":"Prologue:
I discovered this restaurant recently while surfing around on Yelp and bookmarked it after reading a couple of 5-star reviews.
My girlfriend and I were in the mood for a good burger this afternoon so we decided to give it a try.

The Plot:
We shared a single Chicago Burger, a single New York Burger, and an order of Chili Fries.

The Scene:
The portion sizes were good and plenty for the two of us.
Okay, so topping a burger with bright green relish, pickle, and cucumber and then calling it a Chicago Burger seems pretty obvious.
The same goes for topping a burger with pastrami and coleslaw and then calling it a New York Burger.
However, what makes the real difference is how it's done and in this case both were done quite well.
The specialty ingredients nicely complimented the beef in both cases while still being reminiscent of their cities of origin.
The burgers themselves were tasty, juicy, and properly cooked on the flat top.
The other ingredients were also of good quality and properly prepared.
My girlfriend especially liked the balance of sweet and savory in the New York Burger.
We also liked the fact that the seasoned Chili Fries stood up well enough on their own and didn't need to be covered in cheese in order to taste good.

The Rest of the Story:
My girlfriend thought there was a bit too much mustard on the Chicago Burger and I had to agree that it somewhat overpowered the other flavors.
It also occurred to me that a split kosher hotdog cooked on the flat top would have been a nice addition to the Chicago Burger as the pastrami was for the New York Burger.

Epilogue:
Prompt, courteous service, reasonable prices.
We were both very satisfied with our meal.
My girlfriend, who is more discriminating that I am when it comes to burgers, remarked a couple of times that she thought the burgers were good and we'll quite likely return the next time she's in the mood for some.

{"text":"Went there last week.  Hamburger tasted like it had a gallon of stale grease on it. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Striking this one off our list of burger joints, unfortunately.  Soda selection is the best thing about the place, so we'll head down when we feel like trying a new soda flavor."}
{"text":"Honestly best all around burger joint in central / N phoenix. Menu is stacked with amazing burgers and selections great dynamics to have for building such a juicy burger. they craft in house soda with cane sugar, fries are amazing, bottle soda selection is amazing. make sure to check into the specials on hand also, props to Rocket Burger keep it up!"}
{"text":"This place rocks and is so affordable. They have the best sandwiches in town and the Gyro is sooo good. You can get one of their delicious sandwiches for less than $5. Unbelievable!! and all of those soda choices!!!!!!!! I wish you were closer to my house because I would go there all the time!!"}
{"text":"One word comes to mind..... YUM!  Everyone is ranting and raving about the burgers (which are  scrumptious), but you need to try the subs here too!!!

The subs here are amazing!  They are a great price and you get a lot of sub for your buck.  The meat, bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, etc are stuffed into delicious whole wheat bread (they have other types of bread too) and the toppings practically over flow out of the sandwich.  This place is great because they have different types of food to please almost any one and it is all delish.  They have a good selection including burgers, subs, mini corn dogs, salads, gyros, fries, onion rings, etc etc that are all custom made to order.  The burgers are great and I tried the \"moo-yorker\" on a whim which was delicious.  The fries are fresh cut on site and the kitchen is open.  They also have a HUGE soda collection that has many different types of specialty sodas from all over the place. 

I have gone to this restaurant many times and the atmosphere is laid back, casual, and down to the basics.  Good place to go if you have kids.  However, it is a smaller restaurant with limited seating. Also, if you are trying to impress a pretentious date this is probably not the spot for you. The people that work here are all very friendly, helpful, and has a family owner-ship vibe.  

Basically.....  This restaurant has yummy food and great prices.  I definitely recommend that you stop by if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday because I was craving a burger. This is definitely a no frills type of place.  8 or so tables with order at the counter service (they'll bring your food to the table when it's ready). Settled on the Cali burger and a vanilla milkshake.  While I waited, I browsed what seemed to be an infinite number of bottled soda selections.  They were categorized by what appeared to be flavor so you can hone in on what you're in the mood for.  Both of the girls working the counter were extremely pleasant.  My food (to go) took about 7 minutes from the time I ordered it.  Total for the burger(single patty, no fries) and milkshake was about $9.50.  Got home and tore that burger apart.  Man, that was good.  I liked the Rocket Sauce that came on the burger.  Think a ketchup/mayo blend with a ton of pepper for kick.  I didn't even need to put ketchup on the burger.  The bacon was crisp (score!) and the avocado perfectly ripe. The buns they use are also on point.  Definitely more \"sturdy\" than a traditional bun (it reminded me of challah bread).  
I saw a couple other burgers I'd like to try so I'll definitely come back and bring some friends along."}
{"text":"this place is truly one of a kind. the guy who has worked here for a long time (the owner?) is pretty introverted, but a reply good guy. I don't think he means to be rude, he's just an awesome quiet guy. the food is always on point and the soda is always cold. the only thing that would make it better is a bigger spot for this place to really grow. another thing that I wouldn't mind is bigger patties on the burgers. the double patty is a must here."}
{"text":"Here for the second time... looking forward to tasting the chicken teriyaki sandwich. The Cali burger is on point!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place! We would come here again. The burgers and sandwiches are huge! The soda is awesome!"}
{"text":"If you are tired of the usual place or chain restaurant you MUST TRY the DELICIOUS food here!!  Combo is a great deal! Soda fountain is not your standard fountain adding that extra flair to the overall experience.  

I had the California Chicken Sandwich with a side of Mushrooms while my husband had one of the burgers with what very well could be the best cheese curds outside of Wisconsin!!  No joke!

It's small but they serve a might meal for a great price. Make this stop a \"usual\"!!!  Owner is from Delaware and very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Best chicken sandwich I have ever had! They have ghost pepper cheese and cheese curds! Great old fashioned soda choices and the owner is very nice. It is in the plaza of safelite so kind of hard to see but definitely worth it! Lots of variety for all different kinds of taste buds!"}
{"text":"Third time in today. This mini-mart converted into hamburger making awesomeness does not disappoint. Onion rings with panko breading, yes please! Hamburger with rocket sauce, heck yah! Cheese curds, any flavor of soda you would ever want and then some....must stop drooling. 
I need to go here more often, the service is great. The owner is always there, he treats you like a person. 
My 5 year old ate the WHOLE burger tonight, this was after doing some sort of moon dance because I mentioned we were going to Rocket Burger. Burgerlishious!"}
{"text":"Well thanks to Yelp I found another local hidden gem. Specifically in the west side! I had no idea about this place but was in the area and was hungry and wanted something that wasn't a chain. Well Rocket was just the answer. Located in a small run down strip mall I wouldn't have expected such a good place. I was on the run so I ordered the open faced  Big Dipper to go. I really liked how even though it was to go they included a large Cup of an jus to dip my sandwich in. After the sub I was very satisfied. 

As mentioned in other reviews they have a large selection of sodas to drink for sale. I really wasn't in the mood for a soda or I would have tried one. 

I'd like to come back to try more sandwiches and a burger. I was impressed with the friendliness of the staff and value and quality of my sandwich. I'm so glad for Yelp for introducing me Rockets, I will make my way back here sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Can I get a \"god damn\" for the best New Yorker in town.  I think its the cold slaw that has a sweet flavoring that matches well with everything.  If you haven't tried the New Yorker....get it done already, if you haven't tried Rocket Burger.....then you are neglecting yourself.  It's great food at super great prices!"}
{"text":"Their teriyaki pineapple chicken sandwich is AMAZING. And their fries are very good as well. Perfect flavors! I have been in Phoenix for work for about a week and have eaten here three times so far! If I lived here I would eat here a ton! And their drink selection is also extensive..I tried some old styled root beers and cream sodas!"}
{"text":"Wednesday night, nearing end of semester, crazy busy at work--what's a momma to do for dinner? Rocket Burgers for the win! 

Super friendly staff. Basketball on TV. Not the big corporate soda fountain choices. Kids are excited to eat--bonus!! 3 cheeseburgers and one ketchup only burger ordered. Chili cheese fries order is HUGE (\"could have gotten this as a meal\").  4 kids who eat adult sized foods so our bill is usually between $30-40. Our total tonight, $42. 

Best part? Kids who ate without complaining. All of them--at the same time. Well, at least for 3 minutes. A new record. 

I concur with the seating issue but whatev. I have a car where I've been known to eat. A lot. Especially with these guys. 

Could only be made better if they made milkshakes.  Go. Now. Get your fix."}
{"text":"I'm shocked by the reviews. All of the good reviews are what led us to this place. Was so excited to try it out. Akward (not very friendly) people at register, the place was filthy, the food was not great at all and we tried several items on the menu (about 5 different things). The fries were very greasy and mushy. The food was nothing to rave about. And the bathroom was disgusting. After seeing the bathroom, I really regretted stepping foot in there and eating! Not sure what the hype is about. Will not go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. 

I wish I lived closer... actually I take that back, if I lived closer I'd gain 50 pounds because I would be here every other day. 

The claim to fame at Rocket Burger & Subs, I would say, isn't the Burgers or the Subs... It's the assortment of soda. That rhymed. See how I did that? Assortment of Sodas. Sorry, I'm easily distracted. 

Anyhow, there are so many sodas. I had heard about this soda assortment. There I go rhyming again like P-Diddy. But I don't think you can really appreciate it until you see it. 

Being a craft beer fan, I first tried a root beer made by Abita, a brewer based out of Louisiana. I don't even consider myself a liker of root beer but it was a solid choice. 

As far as food, I got a chili dog which was good, but didn't knock my socks off because I was wearing sandals. Flip flops, I think... because I'm classy. 

I did however really like the fried mushrooms. So good. The breading tastes like they surely make it in house. Being from the south originally it reminded me of the breading used on really good fried green tomatoes. So what am I saying here? I'm saying I would like the owner of RBS to consider making fried green tomatoes. But if they don't, it's fine because they also have a fried zucchini that is fantastic. 

I couldn't get get through the meal with out a second soda so I got a Swamp Pop Cola, another Louisiana drink. I didn't plan the Louisiana soda theme, but it worked out because it was pretty good as well.

Will I be back to Rocket Burgers and Subs? Yep! As many times as possible. 

Will I put on at least 10 pounds due to these visits? Yep! Don't judge me..."}
{"text":"The New Yorker is made with the juiciest and most flavorful pastrami I have ever tasted! I really value the fact that the meat doesn't taste like it's been simmering in a steam-table all day. The variety of rare bottled drinks is a really cool way to enjoy a refreshing beverage with your meal. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The best burger spot in town! So glad I found this gem not far from my house.  The garlic melt burger on sourdough with added avocado and ghost pepper cheese was serious food porn! Been back 3 times in the first week. Staff are very nice as well!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and great food with hundreds of soda choices. Try the Gyro burger and the cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices. What more could you want? Oh, you want lots of choices in sodas? They have you covered. Craft sodas on tap, three coolers full of bottles of sodas - many of them I'd never heard of before, and shelves more of sodas waiting to be chilled. It's soda heaven.

Go. Go now."}
{"text":"Firstly...really friendly staff.  The guy at the counter was patient and helpful.  We ordered easily, and the food came out quickly.

Secondly...both our burgers (I got a regular hamburger and hubby got the Santa Fe burger) were drenched in their \"Rocket Sauce\".  My burger was literally falling apart, and I couldn't even taste if I had a patty in there, or not.  It was dripping so much in my basket, I wouldn't have been able to put it down, to taste anything else.  The sauce has a very pickley flavor to it, which neither of us are fans of--we always ask for no pickles on any sandwich.  Hubby couldn't taste his green chile, which is the main reason he got that burger.

Thirdly...I got the fries as a side, and they were the best part of our meal.  Hubby ended up sharing them with me, which I didn't mind, since they do give you a lot.  They're thinly cut and somewhat crispy, but they were all gone at the end of our meal.  As a side, hubby got the fried zucchini.  They were okay, and you could tell they were made there and not frozen.  The only problem was, they were cut way too thick, and the breading was falling off.  We didn't even finish them.

Lastly...the walls of sodas was really impressive.  Hubby got an orange soda by Faygo (we'd seen someone mention it on \"Check Please, Arizona!\").  He downed it quickly.  I'm not a soda-drinker, so I got a bottled water...sorry, not too exciting.  But, it was fun to look at the different brands they had.

Chances are, we won't be going back...we were a little disappointed."}
{"text":"My family has been searching for a good burger place in chandler for years and I think we finally found one! I had the California burger , it was amazing! The fries are perfectly cooked , not too soggy or too hard! My husband had the bacon burger and loved it! My kids even said \"this is my new favorite mom\" which is a huge compliment they have a huge variety of soda. Many I've never seen or heard of which I like! Hope this restaurant lasts a longgggg time!"}
{"text":"The best burgers so far! Fresh, not salty. Cool place and super friendly peeps. We loved it and my boys are very selective and I'm done searching finally. It took 7 years."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence with this one.  The  burger was so huge with pounds of cheese and onions that I couldn't even enjoy the meal.  The big draw is the hundreds of soda bottles to purchase. I didn't care for my Cola. I'll probably return one day to try again."}
{"text":"Got the Mexiburger. Freaking delicious. Bacon. Guacamole. Who knows what other amazingness they put in there. It was perfect. The only reason they don't get five stars is cause they didn't have coke products. C'moooooooon."}
{"text":"Fly me to the moon on a rocket because these rocket burgers are out of this world! (Just kidding don't really do that, I'm afraid of heights.)

It wasn't too busy on a Friday night when we came in, which allowed us to browse through the menu leisurely. There is an extensive selection of burgers in single, double, or rocket size (3 patties on a sub roll. Wow!) and an equally impressive selection of sodas to choose from. The sodas in the cases are sorted out very nicely by flavor, and I love that they offer craft sodas at the fountain (Batch brand). 

I decided on a cheeseburger with avocado and tried some of the Reuburger. For sides we had the \"pick two\" option of fried zucchini and onion rings. The meals came out swiftly and we were on our way to satisfy our growling stomachs!

The cheeseburger was served on a buttered, toasted bun with onions, pickles, lettuce and tomato. I loved the crisp, fresh vegetables with the buttery lightly toasted bun and melted cheese. It was hard to discern a lot of burger/meat flavor with a single patty though so I will have to order this as a double for next time. Note that all patties are served well done. The Reuburger was a combination of Reuben and burger, served with sauerkraut and pastrami. I loved the mix of ground beef with pastrami in conjunction with the sauerkraut. 

The sides were crispy and piping hot from the fryer. The vegetables were tender on the inside and I loved the addition of cornmeal as an added crunch to the batter.

Service was great. Our cashier was friendly and the owner stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our meals.

Overall 4.5/5. This is a excellent place to get a burger! 

P.S. Where else are you going to find Snozzberry soda on tap to go with your tasty burger and sides?"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Town period. Fried green chili burger is the bomb. If you check in at yelp. 10% off combo"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! Fried cheese curds, burgers, and a giant fridge with hundreds of sodas of all brands and flavors. I will go back!
* update: There are some new tech upgrades that make an option for ordering online and receiving receipts via text, email, etc. Very convenient! I just ordered online drove over and picked up my hot food that was ready to go!"}
{"text":"I went to Rocket Burger this afternoon and got the single Ghost Burger. If you like something with a little kick this is the burger for you! The chipotle mayo, along with the Ghost cheese will have you feeling a little heat. The fries were delicious. I got a raspberry soda and wish I would have chosen a different one -- it was just weird tasting. The restaurant looks like a hole in the wall but was very clean with great staff."}
{"text":"Tried Rocket Burger for the first time at lunch yesterday and had to come back again tonight. The Afterburner Burger was amazing. Going for the Eddie Lopez tonight. The fries are perfectly crispy with a hint of seasoned salt, just right. I really enjoy the selection of bottled craft sodas from all over the country - even the fountain sodas aren't your typical big brands - a nice change of pace. 

The Eddie Lopez did not disappoint! I was told that it was voted best burger in the valley last year and I can see why. Very flavorful and drippingly juicy! 

I'll be back to try them all!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great food and hundreds of pop choices too.  I had gyros and a unique root beer.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know where to start with Rocket Burger. I came here for lunch one day after a friend recommended it. The first thing I noticed was the huge selection of specialty sodas to pick from. Then, I saw the menu and was pleasantly surprised at the plages selection of burgers and subs to choose from. After 5 minutes of trying to decide, I ended up going with the Bacon Cheeseburger (not very adventurous on my part, I know...) and a side of Cheese Curds. 

Wow! I can honestly say that it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. I'm not exactly sure why, but it might have something to do with the Rocket Sauce that they put on it. Bottom line, it was fantastic!

It's a cool little restaurant with awesome food. I can't wait to go back and try something new. I'm definitely a fan!!"}
{"text":"This is an absolute dive but it is so incredibly worth it. The food is so good and the people are so kind and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a burger in the East Valley. They use a better bun than normal fast food places like In-n-Out and Culver's. The burger patties are well seasoned, but pretty thin. I recommend getting the double because it's a much better value. The Santa Fe burger is probably my favorite. 

4 stars because the patties are cooked to medium well, but I prefer when burgers are still pink inside. Decent fries and a huge selection of craft sodas to pair with your meal."}
{"text":"You walk in and are greeted by a selection of over 300 bootled sodas (they also have a fountain with pepsi products and SLUSH PUPPIES!) I got the California burger rocket style which comes with three patties on a 12 inch sub roll.  It was fantastic! Plenty of bacon and cheese and they definitely didn't skimp on the avocado!  The bread was freshly baked and fluffy. I also ordered onion rings.  Perfect amount of cornmeal breading, very crispy and not greasy at all. While they specialize in burgers they also serve salads, subs, gyros etc. Great place to stop in for a quick bite. You'll also receivea discount if you check in on YELP :-)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for Philly style cheesesteak in the Phoenix area! The fries are also awesome as well as the humongous choices of unique bottled soda pop!"}
{"text":"So thankful to find this local gem. Is the dining area a little small? Yep. Nothing fancy here (and it sits to the side of a Church's chicken, not a Canes - and I've never had any issue with ample parking). That said, I don't come here for the ambiance, I come here for the food! 

Their service is second only to their burgers, and while the burger patty itself is nothing special, the combinations of toppings and styles they offer are nothing short of spectacular for the price. Also, if you're a fan of fried zucchini - this is *the* place. The amount of food you get is more than satisfactory and man does it taste good!!

It's small, but it's clean. It's super friendly, reasonably priced, and ... well... it's wonderful! It would be hard to go wrong in here, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"was a little disappointed the second time around. I had the gyro burger this time and it wasn't really that great. Still impressed with the soda selection tho. The onion rings were quite well done."}
{"text":"I love this place, i go here for lunch all the time!!! There prices are super decent for the size of everything. I love the chili cheese fries!! 10/10"}
{"text":"this place is a must go if your into dive burger/sandwich/soda shops. My burger which was a special was amazing. Everything worked perfectly together in it. I only wish I had ordered a double instead of the single. Not that the single lacked neat in any way. It just would have made it even better. I had the garlic melt burger combo which included fries and a fountain drink. The burger was cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered. The bun was super fresh and soft. It had garlic mayo, bacon, grilled onions and mushrooms on it. They have craft soda on tap by Batch Craft Soda out of California which is made with real sugar and was delicious. The fries ( which are great!) are hand cut thin with the skins still on them. The woman behind the counter was very nice and the cook that bright me my food was as well. Also saved 10% of my combo by checking in. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Rocket Burger's homemade onion rings are some of the best I've ever had. I love the California burger, and the gyro burger is super awesome. I always make sure to steal a bite of Andy F's rocket burger (it's three patties! on a sub roll! so epic). Part of the fun of eating at Rocket Burger is spending way too long examining all the soda options - last time, I found a dandelion soda, but was just too chicken to try it (but YOU should - and tell me about it!)

The owners and staff are lovely, and you can tell they really care about this place. Andy and I actually had a really terrible experience our first time here (waited an hour + for food that was cold on arrival, etc), and when Andy yelped about it, the owner reached out. He said there was no excuse for the terrible service, but he'd instituted some changes and hoped we'd come back. We've been back a dozen times since that fateful day, and never once have we regretted it! 

Well, I regret not having tried all the sodas. But I feel I made a valiant effort!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to come here for a long time and I finally made it (Well my boyfriend ordered carry out). The food came out super fast so that is a plus. My boyfriend and I ordered the same thing... double philly cheese steak burger with cheese fries. Zero stars for the fries they were tasteless even with the cheese on them. The fries had no crunch and seemed like they were baked or just not fresh. On with the burger.... it was just ok. The Patty was definitely overcooked and the Philly cheese steak was dry."}
{"text":"Let's not all go crazy about Rocket Burger. The burger wasn't great and it certainly didn't beat Five Guys or In-N-Out. The fried foods, onion rings and fries were pretty good. Didn't care much for the unique fountain drink options. Put some Dr. Pepper and Coke in the soda fountain."}
{"text":"Just had a \"Gyro Burger' and washed it down with a Lime Ricky soda. My taste buds are flipping out!  Awesome. Fun. Unique. Rocket Burger Rocks!"}
{"text":"I had the western bbq burger. What's not to like about onion rings, bbq sauce and MEAT? If you order this you will be totally satisfied! Everything about this burger hits on all points. The bun is nice and soft with the right amount of grill char. The patty was thick but not under cooked. Very flavorful. The fries are home cut and were delicious too. I had a Snozzberry and ginger beer soda which was refreshing and tasty since Snozzberry is not on everyone's menu. When I thought it couldn't get any better I had the homemade cookies. This place is great and the food is even better."}
{"text":"This place rocks for value!!. I just had a California Sub and it was FANTASTIC! extra sweet coleslaw with pastrami stuffed in a fresh yogi roll. I really reccomend this one.

This place is kinda tucked away behind Churches Chicken but way worth the trip. They even have exotic sodas in bottles including REAL DR PEPPER. You should try it sometime. Best of all they now have Pepsi in the Fountain drink. A perfect compliment to an awsome sandwich.

If your on a budget and want to get stuffed come here you won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"I ate here a long time ago and today I went back to buy a root beer. As everyone else says, their soda selection is outstanding. They have a very wide ranging menu and seem to have added to it since the last time I was there. I remember the hamburger being very good with a slight peppery taste...which I like. The fries were also well above average and service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"For a burger joint, this is as good as it gets.  I especially loved the large selection of specialty sodas.  They also have the best chili cheese fries, I have never had better chili, it was meaty and tasty and best of all not greasy!  I will definitely go back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"The burgers are ok, nothing special in my opinion. The rocket burger is just 3 patties on a hoagie roll. Overall, I'd rate as average. Staff was very pleasant though"}
{"text":"So I saw this place while my son was signing paperwork in the military recruitment center next door ( GO ARMY!)

We finally were able to make it in and have dinner.
Love it!!
I got the philly cheesesteak and the chili cheese fries.
Both were excellent!  So far, their philly is the closest to a PENN STATION cheesesteak we can find this side of the Mississippi.

The chili cheese fries were like a strange fusion.  
The fries, themselves, were also VERY similar to Penn Station..which we love.  So that's another win.  BUT..the chili on the fries is very similar to Tommys Hamburgers. If you don't know what Tommys is..you haven't lived!!

So its basically an amazing combination!!
The guys working in the place( who mysteriously looked and acted like military recruits) were very friendly, and had our food out promptly.

They also have a HUGE assortment of retro and small batch sodas!
Very cool!
We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I had the Santa Fe with a fried chili on it! Delicious! Also tried the onion rings which did not disappoint. The soda selection is amazing and completes the meal. 
Only draw back is sticky floor and tables."}
{"text":"I love the selection of drinks and how laid back it is! The only complaint I have is that the fries could be a lot better but hey, pretty good joint overall."}
{"text":"I love local shops but this food is sub par to say the least. Im all about greasy hole in the wall, but that does not mean quality has to be terrible, and that is what this place is. I give it two stars for the excellent selection of drinks!"}
{"text":"I just happened to stumble upon this place. This place has some awesome food. I live in Avondale and I drive across town to get food from here."}
{"text":"Went here to eat dinner to be told they are about to close and the guy up front had a shitty attitude about it. This has completely turned me off from trying this place."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and drove 20 min down there to try it. The cooler of sodas are awesome and found a Colorado one from Durango that was very good.  There was an angry customer who was upset over their version of a gyro. His hair was a greasy as the fries (I'll touch on the later). He exchanged the gyro for a hamburger and when the owner brought it to the table he got to close to the angry  customer and I thought a fight was gonna bust out. 
Now on to the food. I consider myself a foodie. The burger meat itself was \"wimpy\" and covered in a sauce. The bun did not end up standing up to said sauce and disintegrated before I was finished. I ordered the cheese fries and wished I hadn't. It was a large portion covered with shredded cheddar and was GREASY blech. I ended up leaving hungry. I did buy a four pack of soda for seven dollars....  I wasn't impressed at all!"}
{"text":"This place is surely a blast from the past.  With the prices it's definitely a restaurant fit for the high school students located just a short walk down the street.  I wish there was a place like this near my high school back in my days.

Rocket Burger isn't just for the kids though.  If you're looking for some tastey food and don't want to pay much this a place worth stepping foot into.  The choice in beverages offered is also another reason alone to come here.  You name it, just about every non-alcoholic drink is in their wall of drinks.

If in the area I'd recommend stopping by.  If not for one of their burgers, subs, hot dogs, gyros, or corn dogs, maybe for a drink to cool off.  I can't wait to come back to the Rocket."}
{"text":"The food was so good I almost re activated my Facebook just to like the establishment. You will not be disappointed. Wish I found this place sooner. Close to asu west"}
{"text":"A good place for satisfyingly indulgent bad for you, but oh so good foods. New Yorker burger is great. Remember to grab napkins before you leave! They put rocket sauce and their special coleslaw on many of their items. Both are delicious , but make for a messy experience. We also love the mini corn dogs. Large portions of everything, especially the fries (one side is totally enough for 2 adults). They have every soda you could ever want, even faygo which is hard to find outside of Michigan. They've also added taps with craft soda. Cool place, not for those on a diet lol :D"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food.  It's a very small area inside and a few tables outside, but food was excellent.  Also an amazing offering of sodas in a bottle and some good fountain sodas.  I had the Chicago burger and it was excellent.  I also did the chili cheese fries, the chili had a quick to it, very good.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I try to live my life with no regrets. Live everyday like it's your last, right? Maybe insert some other cliches in here. Well I can tell you this, I certainly left Rocket Burger & Subs with a huge regret.....REGRET THAT I COULDN'T EAT MORE! Or that I should of tried one of there speciality burgers.

I went and was slightly overwhelmed with the choices I had. It was unexpected given the humble surroundings....it's in a small strip mall...small place... They have all kinds of burgers, your basic, bacon cheese, Mexican, Chili, Eddie Lopez, Baja, Cali, Chicago, Philly and Pastrami. That's not all but just some of what they offer. I ordered the basic bacon cheeseburger. It came out in a reasonable amount of time allowing me a small window of opportunity to sample their craft sodas....Snozzberry, Tahitian Treat and your regular flavors as well. All of them were good.

My burger was exceptional. Nice char on the outside, cheese evenly melted, ample lettuce and tomatoes, bacon was crisp and burger was still juicy. I have to mention the bun was nice and soft allowing me to squeeze it down to take that good bite. Great flavor like you'd expect. Salty and beefy. Once taking that first bite my mind became curious and wondered what that Mexican or Baja tasted like. Regrets like I should of tried pastrami or the Chicago....

Fries were crispy and salty as they should be. All in all...a great meal. I must mention the staff were exceptionally friendly. They all seemed happy which lended itself to the relaxed atmosphere.

I will definitely be back and will make my way through that menu.

Hope you enjoy it!"}
{"text":"This place is worth a visit for the soda selection alone!  To say the least about the soda flavors, they have the usuals and some not-so-usuals (pumkin pie, bacon, king cake). And for those who are not fans of the syrupy sugar rush or if you are watching your waistline, they also have a great selection of unique and naturally flavored carbonated waters (my personal preference so I was thrilled!).

If you want a well-balanced hot dog this place is worth a try. They use beef Hebrew National Hotdogs. For those diehard dog lovers, this brand does contain a lot of sodium, nitrites, and they're plumped using soy protein filler so definitely not the best dog, but a tasty economical dog nonetheless. And the toppings were well-balanced. I can't resist a loaded chicago dog, it was delicious. 

As for the hamburgers, I was underwhelmed. They do have some interesting selections (pbj burger anyone?) but the burger patty is super thin and there isn't much flavor. My burger wasn't dripping with grease either but I definitely ran an extra mile the next day. Keep your expectations realistic and you won't be disappointed. It's fast food, not gourmet. 

Sides were good, aside from the cheese curds (my batch was super salty). Naturally everything is fried but the batter they use has a great consistency and crunch. You could also really taste the ingredients, there was no overwhelming fry oil flavor. I was also informed they prepare the zuchinni in house and nothing is packaged and shipped then flash fried so that's a bonus for sure. No stale box flavor here! 

The staff was also super friendly and patient with us as we perused our options (I am chronically indecisive). 

I may be back for the occassional hotdog hankering and fried zuccini fix and definitely for a carbonated flavor adventure but I wouldn't return for the burgers."}
{"text":"Rocket Burger is the best burger place in town! My go-to burger is the Cali Burger, but everything I've had so far is delicious, particularly the Eddie Lopez and Mexican Burger. All of the sides are amazing, as are the floats, and the soda selection is out of this world so I'm always able to try something new!

The only thing about Rocket Burger that I don't like is the fact that it's a bit of a drive for me, but in all honesty that's a good thing, because I'd probably eat there every single day if it was just down the road from me."}
{"text":"I tried the Phillyburger my wife tried the garlic malt both wore great.
cheese curds ,deep-fried mushrooms,fries all are good.
This soda selection is great
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Came here last night for the first time. I loved all of the soda options. This would be a really bad thing for me if I came here a lot. A bottled soda and fries were $5. That's a little steep. The employees were very friendly. I like the bun on the burger the best. I think the actual burger was just mediocre to me....reminded me of In-N-Out except a waaaaaaaaaay better bun. The fries were good and fresh!"}
{"text":"Love the set-up and the fries are AMAZING! The bun on burger is too big, takes away from burger and veggies... personal preference, thus 4 stars. Definitely a local favorite and highly recommend visiting and supporting! Plus, try a soda you normally wouldn't!"}
{"text":"This place is bad ass , so many different burgers its radonk! I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Favorite place to go to for a simple yet great burger and cheese fries! Oh and also a very unique option of beverages bottled up in all the refrigerators!!"}
{"text":"My previous experience hadn't been fantastic but I decided to try again and I am glad.  I ordered the BLT on toasted wheat and it was outrageously good.  They toasted the bread on the griddle.  It was really high-quality wheat bread.  The sandwich was loaded with bacon.  Only reason it isn't five stars is because of soda.  Yes I know they have an amazing selection but I am a Pepsiholic and the bottle Pepsi must be from Mexico because it has that formula flavor which is not my favorite."}
{"text":"My niece and I were having that conversation...where do you want to eat...I don't know where do you want to eat when we drove past the Rocket Burger corner.  I turned around to try it because of good Yelp reviews and my curiosity regarding the variety of Soda Pop.  We both got a large hot pastrami sandwich and soda pop.  The price was reasonable, the food was good and the soda pop made it a nostalgic experience.  I brought home half of my sandwich.  Just reheated it in the microwave and enjoyed it again.  I'll return to try the french dip sandwich on the menu.  P.S.  The meat and secret sauce gave the sandwich a great bite.  It blows away the 'roast beef' sandwich I had last week at Subway that looked like reconstituted meat."}
{"text":"Fan-freaking-tastic burgers paired with the finest selection of sodas anywhere?  This is a no-brainer...Rocket Burger should be on everyone's list.  I also love the build-your-own 4 and 6 packs of sodas to go, or enjoy with your food.  There's quite literally something for everyone, and the staff is extremely nice.  I order the Cali burger with fries and my wife had the New York with onion rings.  There's no doubt that we'll back....sooner than later!"}
{"text":"The guy at the counter seemed impatient while i looked over the menu as i have never been here before. I told him ill just need a minute to look it over, he replied by saying nothing and continuing to stare. Talk about pressure. I loved the massive variety of soda in a glass bottle. I got a sandwich with a side salad. Loved the bread with the sandwich, it was stacked full making it a little messy to eat. Great, simple flavour. The salad was simple with large chopped veggies such as carots, cucumbers, bell peppers. Overall a great stop for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place in the neighborhood I grew up!

My husband had their bacon cheese burger combo, little guy had the hot dog combo and I had the Italian sun combo. 

French fries were fresh-cut, flavorful and perfectly fried. Their fries alone will get me to come back. 

I had a couple bites of my husband's burger which was very good! The bacon was cooked to the right amount of crispness and the bun tasted fresh baked (although I didn't verify)

The meats on my Italian sandwich were awesomely thick cut. If I get this sandwich again I'll probably ask for some Italian dressing on the side to dip. 

Little guy's hot dog was HUGE!!! The outside skin was nice and crisp so it snapped when you bite into it. 

In addition to the regular fountain drinks, they have a set of specialty fountains that contain root beer, black cherry, ginger beer, etc as well as hundreds of bottled specialty sodas. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I had the Santa Fe Burger and it was really good! Coleslaw is so simple but amazing, want to try everything in the menu . Would not have found this place if it wasn't for yelp, ratings were good and decided to try it. It didn't disappoint! Owner and/or manager was very nice."}
{"text":"Was meeting up with someone for lunch in the area and decided to try it out since some friends have mentioned it before. Kind of an odd parking lot due to a Churches Chicken taking up most of the corner and HS kids are roaming around all the time. Just be patient and roll in. The lady at the counter was very nice, she not only answered our questions but asked a good amount of her own, very personable. I ordered the Cali burger with an egg and the ghost pepper cheese, It. Was. Amazing. The bread, it's always about the bread.. Perfection, amazing texture, kind of like Fuddruckers.  The meat patties were cooked perfectly and were delicious, especially with the fried egg bleeding yolk onto it. The kicker was the ghost pepper cheese, it was a good spicy, very flavorful, not hot just for the sake of being hot. Oh, and they have the largest selection of root beer you can possibly imagine, aaaand I got Dr Pepper."}
{"text":"Presentation is good. Beef patties/ burger meat had no flavor and patties are super thin--if used real burger meat and made own patties it would be better. Bacon used on burger was deep fat fried not pan fried and could tell by grease taste. Cheese looked yummy melted but again no taste--not real. Fries were way over-cooked and not seasoned with anything. Ranch dressing waa good for dipping condiment and tasted homemade. Fountain drinks were all low on flavor and just not good. My double bacon cheeseburger with fries and drink combo was $11.00 with a 10% off coupon. Not worth it. If they upgraded quality of food products served, I'd consider a return trip but not otherwise. You're seriously better off with a fast food chain burger combo. Sorry, keeping it real for real."}
{"text":"I was running some errands and figured it was time to go check out Rocket Burger's and subs. I've heard some pretty good things about this place so I stopped in and checked it out.

The place is located in a strip mall and actually kinda cool.  It's got a huge selection of pop along the wall, and has a great menu of items to choose from.  Prices are fair, and over all, it was a great experience.

I went with the Gyro burger with a pop, and it was out to my table in no time. Hot and tasty, and it hit the spot.  The burger itself was actually quite big, and stacked real high.  Pretty cool!  There's a reasonable amount of seating, with booths and tables like.
  
One thing I noticed is that they only have one unisex bathroom. I guess I'm used to a Men's and a woman's, but that's okay.  The parking lot was also overrun with teenagers for some reason, so I'm not sure what that's about.  There must be a high school near by, but they were just all hanging around, and some of them were in the restaurant as well. I guess it must be a fun place for them to hang out at!

Either way, if your on this side of town, and want something different and cool, go check this place out.  They seem to have something on the menu for everyone."}
{"text":"I had bookmarked this location after looking for new places to try out and decided to give it a try this past weekend. When you first get here, it doesn't look all that inviting, but the food is soooo good!! I can see why this place has good ratings. The service here is amazing. The two girls working behind the counter at the registers were very friendly and helpful and gave great suggestions of things on the menu to try since this way my first time here. 

I decided to do the bacon cheeseburger combo and upgraded my fries to chili cheese fries. Food came out fairly quickly, considering there were many people ahead of me. The young man that brought out my order was very professional and courteous. He smiled and asked if I needed anything extra before he left. Food portions are generous. I wasn't sure how big the burger would be, so I just order the single which was more than enough for me with the chili cheese fries. The burger was cooked well and tasted great! Chili cheese fries were a huge portion with lots of chili and cheese on top. Love that they give you enough chili and cheese to cover all the fries and not just the top ones. 

Inside of the restaurant is small, so many people had to take their food to go. Need to enlarge the seating area so more people can enjoy the whole experience of this restaurant. Parking isn't the best, so come early if you want to be able to find front parking, otherwise, you may be parking out by the dumpsters. 

Can't wait to come back and try more delicious food!"}
{"text":"Definitely a place all burger lovers in the east valley should go to ! It looks like a 'hole in the wall' eatery but sometimes these turn out to be real gems. 
Single patty burgers are large enough, New York style fries are done perfectly plus they have an assortment of quirky bottled sodas which are hard to find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Wow!! I don't know how I missed this place!?  Where do I even start?? The yummy sodas ...made of pure cane sugar....nuff said. Delicious cheese curds fall apart in your hand! Fried mushrooms...oh..em...gee....so fresh and good! Lastly...but least... I had the Baja Burger...ah-ma-zing! The flavors were to die for. Very creative pieces of taste bud art. All the sauces are made in house. The cashier was cute...helpful and friendly. She gave me a sample of the sauce that goes in the fish sandwich....it honestly was like nothing I've never tasted. Again creative and full of flavor. Small quaint place that filled up quick at 530pm. They also have a large fridge with over 550 craft sodas. Even Faygo from back home. I'll be bringing my burger loving son here soon. Best food eating experience in a very long time. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"This place is addicting! Literally hundreds of bottles of soda to choose from! They make some pretty awesome burgers, too! I always recommend getting whatever their daily special is, as it is usually a little cheaper with the fries and soda! Also, you won't find Coke or Pepsi products from the fountain...craft sodas only!! My favorite burger is the Ghost Burger...it is not for the faint of heart! The combination of chipotle sauce and ghost cheese will send smoke out your ears! The employees are really friendly, which makes deciding on what to order an easy process. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"The staff were super friendly and accommodating! The cheese curds were phenomenal....must have!! My son liked his chili burger and the onion rings were delish! I wasn't super impressed with my single bacon cheeseburger. The beef patty was super thin so it just tasted like bread and rocket sauce. I'll try something different next time! Amazing assortment of bottled pop!"}
{"text":"Ok...I was so excited to eat here, from out of town and was sold by all the great posts and photos!! But it was one of the worst meals of my life. We enjoyed the sodas and bought 6. We ordered: New York burger, Mexican burger, Chicago dog, chili cheese dog, fried mushrooms. The hot dog buns were very hard, both me and my brother got a couple bits into our burgers and were almost completely turned off and couldn't eat another bit. The hot dogs were barely enjoyable as well... maybe the burger was so bad it made everything taste bad. Mushrooms were ok. We did take our food togo, but I wouldn't expect it to ruin the food this much. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"It's okay but this place is a bit overrated for their food. Great select of soda though. 

Hot dogs seem like they've been warming all day, fries are alright but are too thin to be over cooked. Chili is decent. The wall of soda is what makes this place unique."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Such good quality.  Being in a not so good part of town, you might think the place is run down but it's great.  They have a huge selection of soda (pop)... and I mean HUGE!"}
{"text":"HOW did my burger and fries come out so fast? I swear, I turned back to my booth from picking out a soda from the many to choose from, and there it was!

I'm not sold on the rocket sauce, but I can ask them to leave that off next time. My fries didn't seem totally fresh, but they weren't bad. Super crispy bacon for the win.

Filling, satisfyingly greasy, reasonable prices. I'd be willing to make a return trip and try something else from the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing. Sodas from all over the nation. Staff is super friendly. This is my go to burger place. I seriously drive 30 miles to get here from my house."}
{"text":"This burger joint is amazing...  Very limited seating so be prepared to eat family style if necessary; it adds to the charm.  The beverage choices are amazing and the prices are ridiculously cheap.  It takes me almost an hour to get there from my house and they've never disappointed me."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the burger was 5 stars! However, the fried zucchini was just pretty good and the onion rings looked like it was the cooks first attempt ever at making them. The chili cheese fries were a disaster. Also, I thought it was lame that they charged me a dollar extra to do half n half on two items that were the same price. Greed isn't something that scores extra stars on Yelp. The service wasn't very good. The cook kept coming out and talking to people he knew in the dining area so our food took a long time. 

Would I go back- yes
Would I recommend the burgers- absolutely
Would I tip them- hell no! Need better service

Nice selection of sodas you probably have never seen or heard of too! I love Root beer and they have an entire fridge full to choose from. 

Overall incredible burger. Anything fried I would stay away from and wouldn't get the chili cheese fries, they are soggy and the chili is poor. 

Still worth it for the burgers tho, prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Omg!! The Baja burger was amazing!!!! So flavorful and the coleslaw made the burger taste so yummy! The Santa Fe burger was good and it had fried peppers in it. It wasn't as good as the Baja burger but still yummy. I wasn't a fan of the onion rings but the fried zucchini was really good.

The portion sizes are freaking big and we ordered the smallest burgers! I can't even imagine what the rocket size looks like. 

I love how they have so many drink selections which are in fridges kinda like what you see at the gas stations. 

Expect to eat over 1000 calories!! Lol"}
{"text":"Amazing one if the best burger spots in Phoenix, I eat here every time I think I deserve a treat.. Never tried the sodas but the food is always great"}
{"text":"A little hard to find tucked behind a gas station and with all the window signage it looked closed but we were just to early before the lunch crowd lined up.
Luckily it wasn't super busy because we had a large party of kids and trying to get all their orders was something of an ordeal and then the adults all wanted something modified.
But our cashier deftly handled our entire order and didn't skip a beat or become frustrated. Yea!!!
We ordered quite the variety of grilled cheese and hot dogs, corn dogs and chilli dogs for the kids.
I had the double California burger with avocado and loved it. Super messy with fries to soak up everything.
The soda bar was pretty special with the natural sugar sodas which tasted much better then the regular sodas. You would be hard pressed to not find a soda you like here.
I can't wait to come back to try another concoction on their menu. Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"When you go to Rocket Burger make sure to get the mushrooms. My favorite burger is the teriyaki burger. The burgers are huge and full of toppings. Make sure to have a large appetite.  You will order at the counter and the customer service is excellent.  They will help you with your needs. Don't forget they also have 100's of different kinds of sodas."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie. When I first arrived, the outside of this store looked very ghetto. I hesitated to walk in but the review for this place is so well, I thought to myself that I need to give it a shot. The outcome is that I found a delicious burger place. This place had one of the best burgers I've had and I'd definitely recommend others to try."}
{"text":"Top 3 west side burger shop. Can possibly make # 1 after a few more visits and a couple cracks at the burgers on the menu. Philly burger with homemade fries oh my."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I get the rocket love.  Maybe it's just not my speed, but after one visit, I'm not really inclined to return.  There is an awesome selection of soda's in the bottle though.  Maybe that's worth the trip.

The wife and I rolled in after attending an RV show in Peoria.  On the way home, I remembered all the raves about this place, and it was about lunch time, so we re-calculated our route and made a stop in here.

I'm kind of a Root Beer fanatic, and it was great to see all the different brands.  I just randomly picked one.  Not even sure what it was, didn't have much head, but good flavor.  I also had been craving a hot dog.  Got one of those along with a cheeseburger.  The hotdog was awesome, grilled all-beef quarter pounder served nicely on a toasted bun.  That fixed my craving.  The cheeseburger part was simply for reference.  It was decently prepared and presented, but the bun was stale.  Not stale enough to taste bad, but enough to crumble into unworkable chunks of bread before I finished the burger.  I probably left a quarter of the bun in crumbles in my basket.

So overall, this was a first-impression review and I can say while I wasn't blown away, It also was not bad either.  Maybe I'm spoiled by all the custom-burger places in my neighborhood, and after all the raves I've heard, maybe my expectations were too high.  But for the price, quality and ambiance (which is not something they have) of Rocket Burger, it's a decent option."}
{"text":"OK I will admit I am pretty ashamed of myself here. I did not realize I had not reviewed this place yet. SHAME ON ME!!!

I have been here half a dozen times and this place always makes me smile, and full.

The food here is awesome, dozens of Burgers, Hot Dogs, sides and do not forget the fried Cheese Curds. Then there is the infamous Rocket Burger. You can get any burger turned into a Rocket Burger (on a sesame seed sub bun) it is delicious but you have to have a huge stomach.

Sometimes I will stop in just to get a 6 pack of soda and then spend 20 minutes deciding which one I want. I believe I counted approx 360+ sodas?

They also have slush puppies, I have not seen or had these since I was a kid.

I would love to see this place expand it is awesome. All of the food I have tried was extremely good.

My kids beg to come here for dinner all the time!

...Why are you still reading this and not driving to this place? GO!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome . Great burgers. Subs are excellent. Plan on going back soon. Overall experience was great"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a great burger.  The patties are somewhat thin so you might have get at least a double.  I noticed that the bun was very fresh and tasted great.  It's probably the best bun I have ever had on a burger.  It was just perfect.  I have noticed that other fellow Yelpers are also feeling the same way.

The fries were below average to me. I will be back again someday for the burger!"}
{"text":"Very good place to break your diet :)  the fried zucchini are the best ! I love the green chili burger with the fried green chili !"}
{"text":"Burger was big and greasy, if that's the way you like it. Huge root beer selection. HUGE. The owner was great. He stepped from behind the counter to help me pick one out."}
{"text":"So good! Kinda small on the inside of the restaurant but nothing wrong with taking this amazing burger home and destoying it. Everything is so fresh you taste a huge difference."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger joints. They have such a fun selection of soda in all flavors. And lots of different types of burgers. Their rocket sauce is very good."}
{"text":"So, My husband and I were out and about when he said he wanted a burger, and his go-to place for burgers is In & Out *womp, womp*  Myself, on the other hand... I love burgers and finding new places....out comes the trusty dusty Yelp. We live fairly close to this location and due to the reviews we decided to try it out. 

When first arriving, I have never felt so welcome to a place before! Which quickly turned overwhelming by all the choices on the menu! Who knew you could have so many burger combos! It was worth the trip in just to see the soda selection as well. I loved all the different flavors.  I chose the Sante Fe burger which was delicious with the fried green chile. My husband chose the Afterburner Burger (I think, Which ever burger has all the hot peppers) 

I think the only complaint that we had was they didn't ask us how we liked the burgers... ie. medium rare or well done.... which made me believe at that time that maybe they were frozen patties?? Why else wouldn't they ask if they were fresh? So that warranted my 3 star review. When we were served our burgers, there was SO much toppings that we could barely taste the meat itself, So I would suggest getting a double patty next time. The burgers were also not very flavorful and really thin. Maybe so many toppings to give the burger flavor since the meat itself didn't have any. 

Regardless, the burger condiments and toppings were awesome. Fries were good too. Portion sizing was big as well."}
{"text":"I arrived here with my beau before a dinner rush. We both got the bacon cheeseburger and loved it! He rated it a 7.8/10 on the fast burger scale and i rated it a 7. It was messy, it had good fresh lettuce and tomatoes, everything a good burger should be and have in my opinion  The bottled soda was fun to look through. We both are fans of huckleberry so we got different huckleberry sodas, very fun. Price was very reasonable for a good thick burger."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger and I wanted a good one so I searched yelp for good burger reviews. I decided to try this place out today because it's just two miles from my home. The location isn't all that great, like someone else mentioned it's more like a convenient store than a restaraunt. I ordered the gyro burger and it was such a great idea and delicious. My only complaint is the burger patty was really small and didn't cover the whole bun. I washed it down with a Fentimans Dandelion & Burdock soda which was interestingly different tasting. They have so many different soda's it was hard to pick one so I just tried the one with the oddest ingredients I could find. My friend ordered the Baja burger and it was very messy but she said it was awesome. She liked the bread and the toppings. We're both fans now."}
{"text":"Mm this place is great. Kind servers, fast service, good food. My son spilled his drink, they were so understanding and nice about it. We had a good time while we were here. We will definitely come back n bring some friends! :)"}
{"text":"Great customer service and amazing food, glad we found on yelp. They really love the food they make and it shows. Cant wait to try out more items and next time a beverage from their many choices !!! 
They are also down the street from us ! YAY!"}
{"text":"Meh. I've had better burgers at the local Denny's. The fries were either old or refried. The chilli on my chilli-cheese-fries tasted like cheap canned chilli. Won't go back... Nothing there I can't get cheaper and better at other places."}
{"text":"The burger bread was soggy, fries was too salty, and the waitress gave my order to the wrong table.... but overall a good price, check in receives 10 percent off"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for a while and I finally made it! I can't believe I haven't been here sooner, me and my husband loved what we ordered. The New York burger and the garlic chicken sandwich. We both ordered a drink and got to choose from a variety of drinks they offered. We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great burgers and every root beer you can imagine in a bottle! Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"First time visit, found using Yelp.  Decor is a little funky with colorful rockets painted on the walls.  First thing you notice is a set of large coolers with every brand of soft drink bottles and cans.  I had no idea there were so many different varieties and brands on the market.

Staff was very friendly and offered several suggestion as they have a large number of burgers with all sorts of choices available as single  and multiple patties.

My wife selected the California Burger with Avacado, Bacon, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato and Onion Rings.  They offer their \"Rocket Sauce\" which is based on a variant of Thousand Island.  She had an order of Onion Rings.

I had a Teriyaki Burger which came with Cheese, Pineapple, Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo and a homemade  Teriyaki Sauce.  I had French Fries.

The Burgers were fabulous!  They have a special Bun, a giant step up from the more conventional mass produced bun.  The beef was not overcooked and was delicious. The bun was more dome shaped than flat and a challenge to open wide enough to get the burger in your mouth gracefully.

Generous slice of Pineapple and Tomato.

The Onion rings were some of the best we have ever had.  The coating was thinner than what you normally get but fabulous in taste.  The portion was very generous and came with a couple small containers of Ranch Dressing.

Unfortunately the French Fries were a disappointment.  Generous portion but rather small cut, texture was overly soft and color dark brown indicating a non premium type of potato.  Too little starch and to much sugar causing the overly dark color and somewhat oily taste.

Would have rated the meal as five stars but poor fries dropped them a full star.

Will definitely return and perhaps talk to the staff about selecting a better potato or more optimum cooking method."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! I got the garlic special and it was delicious! I ordered the California burger this tube and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"So happy to find a place where my friends and relatives can enjoy a delicious hamburger while I have the best vegetarian sandwich in town.Then, to top it off, there are great fries and an endless selection of pop to complete the meal. It takes me a while to decide which soda I'd like to try each time I'm there. The service is great and the employees are very curtious and helpful. I love this place."}
{"text":"Came in on 6/19 for lunch. My buddy was hyping this place up, so we came here.

The staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu. But, the prices are a little pricey for the size and quality of the food.

I ordered the Afterburner burger (single patty) with ghost pepper infused cheese and an order of zucchini. Along with the drink, it came out to just over $14. And to be honest, it wasn't worth it as I was expecting a decent kick from the jalapeños and ghost pepper cheese. The jalapeños were not even close to spicy and the cheese did provide a hint of spice. It also had this rocket sauce (I think that's what it was called) and I'm not sure what it was trying to do. It had no flavor. Then, I saw the patty and it was pretty sad as it looked like one of those frozen patties from those commercials. So the burger I rated as a 1 out of 5 stars. Then we had the fried zucchini and they were pretty good. I think they used corn dog breading and it was tasty. So those I'll rate at 4 out of 5 stars.

I'm pretty sure I wouldn't recommend this place for the burgers, but good thing they offer a good variety of other items. They also have a ton of different soda to choose from. Hell! They have root beer on tap."}
{"text":"After reading such great reviews about Rocketburger I thought I was just about to have the best burger I've ever tasted! But after ordering the Cali burger with fries and a specialty root beer, I was mistaken. It wasn't a bad burger by all means, but for the price it was disappointment. ($10.33, for a single burger, fries, and root beer.) although when placing my order the staff was very polite and delivered my burger very fast! Not sure I would make another visit though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! New York Burger is absolutely delicious! Plus the enormous selection of soda is the best! If you haven't eaten here before you are missing out! It's a one of a kind place."}
{"text":"Good Burger !!! Good Service !! Great Soda Selection !!! Fast Friendly Service !!!  Great Menu of Burgers !!!"}
{"text":"The burgers are good but not as good as the Yelp rating would indicate.  I had a sandwich there once and it was very mediocre.  The fries are terrible.  Ditto for the frozen soft serve ice cream or yogurt product.  It taste like low fat.  Exceptionally low quality.  I'd certainly eat the burgers again but not the other offerings."}
{"text":"This place just doesn't do it for me. Even with their check in special I feel like it's way over priced for what it is. It will cost min $50 for my family to eat there and that's too much for the area/food. These are burgers and hotdogs people. My kids hate the breading on their chicken but like the corn dogs. I love their cheese curds but the sauerkraut on their dogs is nasty. It's 'ok' but nothing to go out of your way for"}
{"text":"I had the single California burger.   It was great.  It had avacado, swiss and lots of bacon.  Flavorful, thin burger medium rare.

The cook came over and served us.  He came back again to check on us.  We were all compliments. Great service.  I would come back.

A friend had the afterburner burger.  He had the double patty and raved about it.

The fries were good, a bit on the salty side.  

The menu is big.  Plenty of choices and they are quick!

The place used to a cousin's subs before and is bit hidden next to safelite auto glass."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! The vibe is super awesome and there is a plethora of craft sodas to choose from!! 

The onion rings are the perfect mixture of onion and batter, not to thick and caked lightly. I get the New Yorker on marble rye with ghost pepper cheese, (warning it's HOT) the sandwich is filling and so flavorful! 

Don't forget the rocket sauce!"}
{"text":"The best Burgers and home of a Thousand Sodas and beverages ,owner and staff are the best"}
{"text":"Just tried this place out and i was really glad i did. I got a double bacon cheese burger which was very good. Was not a big fan of the fries but they're not too bad. And there was these 2 guys working that seemed a bit rude and immature. Overall i'd go back but definitely will say something if they act that way again."}
{"text":"Glad we tried this place.  It was delicious and the burgers were juicy. 
We got the philly burger, the garlic melt, cheese fries and chicken nugget kids meal. Everything was Cooked to perfection. Very large selection of crafted sodas glad they came to the neighborhood and looking forward to coming back.  Only suggestion I do have is to offer a gluten free bun."}
{"text":"Had the New Yorker burger, onion rings and peanut butter shake. It was all delicious. Bottle soda selection is amazing and have had many of the different root beers all of them awesome!"}
{"text":"We are from So. Cal., have travelled far/wide in southwest/more & have never had as good a green chile cheeseburger anywhere. This scrumcious burger is called the Santa Fe Burger. Veggies (tomatoes, onions pickles), cheese, fried green chile, bacon & rocket sauce. The depth, taste, & texture was amazing. Served hot in a perfect crunchy outside/soft inside bun! Was not sure about a fried chile, thinking it may be heavily dipped/fried, but it was 'heavenly' breaded & fried to perfection, not oily, but fairly thick & crisp, adding another dimension to the old standby found in many New Mexico burger shops. Don't think it was the unsurpassed New Mexico Hatch chili which is the only thing that would improve this outstanding burger. I had the single which I could not finish because of its size & hubby had the double which he did finish. Num!

Fries were not memorable. Oil not hot enough, I believe.  They wilted as they cooled.  Next time we'll try the onion rings, zucchini, or mushrooms. Apparently for these other veggies, they use the same coating as the above-mentioned chili in the burger.  

We stuck w/ the regular soda machine, but hundreds of choices in chilled bottles are behind glass to choose from.

Wish we were staying one more night so we could go back and totally ruin our diets! Ha!  Excellent price points, as well. Get yourselves over there before they have to expand to a pricier market."}
{"text":"This is bar far the best burger in town. Make sure you try the santafe burger.  The onion rings holy shit  I swear you will hurt yourself"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed rockets New york sub, it was like nothing i have tasted. The burgers are okay. The shakes are alright. I really enjoy the selection of beverages at this restaurant. The only thing i didnt really like was that the cheese curds were just too greasy. Other then that Rockets is where its at. Its nice for Moon Valley High School that this restaurant is right next door.Its just a bit pricey if youbuy for multiple people."}
{"text":"Greatest burgers, sandwiches, soda pop and zucchini fries but the French fries are disgusting. I'll never order there fries"}
{"text":"Our burger was juicy and perfectly cooked to order and the fried green chili was different,  but really good."}
{"text":"This little place showed up on yelp and the wife and I just decided to give it a shot. When we entered we were greeted by two very nice men then I noticed the soda pop. Everything you have ever wanted in a soda pop selection. Everything from real sugar Pepsi to saranac Shirley temple. I decided to have the biggest burger I could and what a choice. I decided the newyork burger was what I craved. Burger on a fresh bun with tons of thin sliced cole slaw and amazing pastrami. The hot dog was the best my wife Ashley has had. Top it all off with chili cheese fries. No bean chili the way I like it. Fresh cut fries and it was cheesy heaven. The best part, 2 full people, 2 great sodas.....$12. Love it."}
{"text":"Guys, I love this place! We found it on accident and I've been back 5 times! 

Classic burger joint. The ambience is what you would expect. It's a burger joint! Come on! 

Every single roll I've had was delicious, warm, and fresh. It was great! 
If you love classic, real potato fries, this is your joint! 

I had the cherry slush-puppy with a gyro burger and it was freakin' great! I was  expecting just gyro meat, and it was loaded with meat & a burger patty that was flavorful and moist! 

The Philly is good, but we don't do green peppers, that's a Jersey thing! Get it right! 

There was this WALL OF SODA. This place has every flavor and brand of soda out there! Try the cream sodas, the maple bacon, the butter scotch, so much! 

Best part of the meal was the fried mushrooms. BEST. IN. THE. WORLD. 
I've never had better. Seasoned to PERFECTION! 

A little more expensive than average, but the food is above average so it's OK!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Family owned feel with friendly staff. It's my family's favorite calorie splurge place. The burgers are amazing. We always leave stuffed."}
{"text":"I just had a rocket-sized bacon cheeseburger and soda float from Rocket Burgers & Subs. They were both absolutely delicious! This is a great place to dine and order food from. They have an amazing array of soda flavors. The staff is awesome with great customer service. Make sure you check out their menu."}
{"text":"Ohhh my yummmm!!! Their garlic mayo is the best on the burgers along with their fries !!! Very good burger fresh NOT frozen and they put a good amount of bacon,and alvacado on their cali burger !! I definitely found my go to spot for a vintage soda and a great burger and fries!!!"}
{"text":"i dream about this place...in fact my stomach is growling just thinking about it. been here a few times, always down to try something new each time. however, my heart belongs to the eddie lopez burger. i've yet to get down on the cheese curds, the fries are tasty as well as the onion rings. the kids and i spend at least a good 15 minutes perusing the soda selection. this place makes me happy, so very very happy. i just wish i didn't live so bloody far..."}
{"text":"After dining here almost every day of his week-long vacation, The Rob has decided that it is not a grease that comes off some of the burgers, (as previously stated) but a sort of au jus sauce, the contents of which is trying to break down with each visit.  Makes me feel a bit better about the massive amounts of beef, fried potatoes and fried cheese he ingested in such a short time.  

Oh, and we are super hooked on the fries now too.  Like, craving hooked.  Good for them, not good for me and my estranged relationship with the elliptical machine.  Sigh."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight. Had the Chicago Dog and Fries. Steve had the Philly cheese steak sandwich and zucchini and a bottle of Dad's root beer. Loved everything. Will be going back soon. Good service and excellent food. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"We were looking for something different and in the mood for a good burger in Chandler.  Read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give Rocket Burger and Subs a try.  So glad we did, good burgers, fries and chicken sandwich special.  Owner came out to check on us and see how everything was, very friendly and good service.  We'll be back and plan to bring the ACP Erie crew since it is right around the corner!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best dive burger shops in Phoenix.  They have a whole wall dedicated to glass bottle sodas, and you can find pretty much any soda you've ever wanted to try...including some you may not want to try (bacon flavored soda!)...but that's the fun of it.  

As far as food and burgers go, there are some real options here like the New York burger which comes with Pastrami, or the Philly Cheesesteak burger, which is also incredible.  They also have hot dogs, subs, desserts, and so much more. There are so many options, which leaves me hesitant at most places because I wonder how they can do so much and still uphold quality, but this place manages to do it (try the ghost pepper cheese on your burger!).  

On top of the food and soda, this is a local family-owned restaurant with friendly staff.  I have personally seen the owner talk with a homeless man who walked in and he gave him a drink and made him feel welcome even though the man didn't buy anything.  It's nice to have places like this in the neighborhood, and whenever I am in the neighborhood, I make sure to give this place my business."}
{"text":"First and foremost - DON'T BE SHOCKED BY THE LOCATION OR FIRST IMPRESSIONS! 
This place is awesome, has a great selection of drinks (especially root beers), and the value of the sandwiches is over the top! 
Don't forget to try the onion rings. They use their own breading made out of corn meal and spices. The amount of food you get is a great value. 
I travel the nation weekly, and will be visiting here again in the future."}
{"text":"Okay, let's get this straight...there are pros and cons here. 
Pro: I think they have more soda than Rocket Fizz. It's all refrigerated and ready to drink!
Pro: They have a Santa Fe Burger which involves a battered, deep-fried green chili which is utter genius. I repeat, Utter Genius.
Pro: The burgers are well-crafted with attention to detail and carefully laid out, not assembled by an uncaring worker and squished into a wrapper quickly.
Pro: They have Pepsi products on fountain in case for some reason ~300 types of bottled soda (most made with Real Cane Sugar OH YEAH) just doesn't do it for you and you need to blend your own suicide-soda.
Pro: They will make any soda you want into a float, using soft-serve, for a buck!
Pro: Locally-owned by a guy who seems pretty nice and genuinely interested in his customers and their thoughts. That's a HUGE PLUS, people...pay attention! 
Pro: The burgers' pickles are good! they don't taste like run-of-the-mill, cheap, food purveyor 5 gallon bucket pickles.
Pro: They have a website that seems to be pretty current, it alerted me to the fact that they have some of the last remaining Dublin Dr. Pepper in the world and I should buy now. (Disclosure: While I like Dr. Pepper - I'm not a superfan, and have never tried it - so I figured the $15/6packs were better left to the superfans and collectors).
Pro: The building seems to be laid out in an \"L\" fashion, with the soda selection and main tables on one side; and an 'extra\" area of seating on the other side of the kitchen that seems to have a pass-thru ordering window. That probably comes in pretty handy during lunch rush when the kids from the hi-skool next door probably mob the place. We didn't notice this until we were leaving...so I'll have to explore that next time.

Con: The signs telling you about the $1 float options are too high to notice until you've already ordered. Perhaps this is another stroke of genius to encourage repeat business, perhaps its an oversight.
Con: It's an older property, so it doesn't have that super-clean feeling about it. It's not dirty by any means...but it's at that stage of life where its not sterile, but not quite yet charming. Of course, this whole part of town is at that stage - so you can't really hold that against the place.
Con: Soft-serve rather than real ice cream.  It's not that I hate soft-serve, I give it its credit...but I prefer real ice cream. (Disclosure: if they used real ice cream, I'd probably bitch about that too, because I'm kind of a dairy snob).
Con: Shoestring potatoes. I know they have the skin on, and are natural-cut, and shoestrings have millions of loyal followers...I'm not one of them. Give me a tater-tot any day.

Other things of note: My single burger was BIG. You can also go double or Rocket Burger, which is 3 patties on a sub roll. I can't imagine eating that - but I'm sure its a fave amongst many!

Bottom line: Pros obviously outweigh cons and the fact that it is a family-owned/run business always weights positive in my book! We'll be back."}
{"text":"I know this is a burger place. But I love hot dogs and good dogs are hard to find.  I especially love Chicago dogs.  Now these hot dogs are called Chicago dogs but are grilled and not on the traditional poppy seed bun. But we LOVED them!  And that's unusual for us as normally nothing  but a traditional Chicago dog will do.  Also great fries and onion rings. And love the craft sodas!  Have been twice already and will be back. A third time. And a fourth time. And so on and so on.."}
{"text":"rocket burger is by far THE BEST.BURGER.PLACE.EVER!!!! I found it's also the best valley... when i eat here i feel i get way more than what i pay for!! we eat there on a regular basis and have never been disappointed even a little bit!!! when i move next month this is the only place i will miss in arizona!! and every visit back home we will come and eat here!!! oh and do you like soda? any kind that you can imagine they have it in cool glass bottles! Oh and slush puppies too! This place is great just come try it for yourself you'll know what I mean!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Excellent quality fast food, great selection, friendliest people, and tons of gourmet sodas... recipe for success."}
{"text":"Meh. My Burger wasn't that great. The Bacon was overcooked. I came mostly for the soda selection. It takes a while to find the one you're looking for. They do have a lot of choices. I found the birch beer I wanted. I'll be back but mostly for the sodas."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my buddy. We both were absolutely NOT disappointed. Buddy ordered the Mexican burger which came with bacon and avocado. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger which comes with the special rocket sauce (think of Big Mac special sauce). I also ordered cheese curds. All burgers are made medium well which is how I like my burger but if you don't like pink in yours, make sure to say something. The burger was juicy and the bun was butter toasted to perfection. Cheese curds were cheesy and tasty. French fries were well seasoned and freshly made. Menu is expansive as is the bottled soda options. I look forward to coming back and trying different burgers. I also want to try the Mexican hot dog."}
{"text":"All the sodas you could want...from EVERYWHERE!!! Always a new delicious burger on the Specials menu and the fries are top notch!  Anytime we are in the area, we stop and get a good quick meal here :)"}
{"text":"Heard these rocket burgers take you to the moon and back so I said why not give 'em a try!

Location & Aesthetics - located in Phoenix just off W Cactus Road at the intersection of N 35th & W Cactus Road.  The business is behind a Raising Cane's and I almost missed it as I had to swing around on N 35th Ave.
Parking was on the dismal side and there weren't enough spots available.  Luckily, I snagged that last remaining parking spot.  I'm unsure where I would've parked if there weren't any available spots....perhaps in Raising Cane's parking area (-1).
Interior decor is interesting as they have pictures of famous figures from sports and other areas with the accompanying prices of things from yesteryear, e.g. the cost of a soda in the '40's or '50's.
Seating was adequate and comfortable, and the dining areas was clean.  Along one wall was lined a wide selection of soda pop which was interesting.  Many different names and bottle shapes that is a must see if visiting.  
One negative was the dining area was on the small side so if you're coming with a party of more than 5, you may have to put some of the tables and chairs together (-1), and sadly there's no outdoor seating.

Menus - posted on a chalk board above the cashier who also takes your orders.  There are more detailed menus on the countertop which we were given.      

Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming, and answered any questions we had about the menu items.
If dining in, staff will bring your food to the table.  

Food - I had the double cheeseburger, fries and a strawberry shake.  
The shake tasted like there were real strawberries used, very creamy and thick, and very well mixed.  
The fries looked they were freshly cut with the potato skin still on them - crunchy, well seasoned, tasty, not too overcooked or limp, and not over salted.
The burger was juicy, well seasoned, tasty, not very greasy or runny, and cooked perfectly.

I am interested in trying some of their other inventions and will probably return though will probably order for take-out because of the lack of parking!"}
{"text":"Just driving by Rocket Burger, you don't think much of it. Looks like no frills, hole in the wall burger joint thrown into the cityscape with every other place but TRY IT! It's a cute little counter service burger/sandwich joint owned and operated by an adorable married couple.

Honestly the food is in my opinion an A- but the customer service and selection of menu items as well as beverages is outstanding. The burgers are really good. Not the best I've ever had, but for a modest price, very well worth the money. Their fries are well seasoned and come in big portion sizes too.

Warning: this won't be everyone's experience! ...but, on my fiancee and my first time through, the wife/co-owner ended up bringing us a sample of some of the sides we had asked about while ordering. Didn't charge us or tell us she was doing anything; just brought it out and told us to enjoy. So nice! 

So the decor won't wow you and yeah you may find a slightly better gourmet burger somewhere else but this little gem is worth a visit for sure and I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to usually make dramatic statements but : BEST BURGERS EVER

My office recently moved to this area and have come 3 times now. My favorite is the Afterburner Burger.  Also, an incredible selection of soda. Much of it pure cane sugar. Very nice staff, always busy."}
{"text":"I love this place !!!!! Living in cali im still to find good philly cheese steak out there and trust i have looked  . I will gladly drive 4.5 hours just for a good meal ...... thanks for the best philly cheese steak in the west !!!!"}
{"text":"A large menu offering many different flavors that will impress you in comparison to even Red Robin. The venue is nothing to brag about so it's hard to bring guests from out of town here. The bottled soda selection will spin your head trying to select so hopefully you have an idea before going in."}
{"text":"I came here again with my wife for dinner. She had a chicken sandwich with a teriyaki pineapple sauce that was absolutely delicious. I did the Mexican hot dog again.

Once again I was reminded why this place is so highly recommended. The food was amazing, the fries have gotten much much better too! Keep it up Rocket Burger! 

I can't wait until next time. There's just so much good stuff on the menu that I think I'll be busy trying something new on each visit for a long time to come."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I had it bookmarked for such a long time & one night, I couldn't figure out what I wanted to eat for dinner & figured it would be the perfect time to check this place out. They have so many different options to choose from, it was so hard trying not to order everything all at once! Haha. I've been craving a Philly cheese steak for such a long time and this was also recommended by one of the employees at the register. 

I've had quite a few different Philly cheese steaks from other places but this one is definitely one of the best! The bread was so soft and nicely toasted & didn't get soggy (as some of them do from meat juices). Perfect amount of meat and cheese too. Their fries, I wasn't that impressed with. They definitely look and taste hand cut fresh potatoes. I usually like my fries crispy so I asked them to be well done. This was a mistake because they actually tasted burnt rather than being crispy. 

They have so many different soda's to choose from. They have so many bottle lined up against their windows and fridges full of bottles soda. & they also have craft soda on fountain."}
{"text":"First and foremost love the food.   Just a few things today that irritated me which I had let go in the past when it was one thing: a) the phone wasn't working so couldn't call in my order, b) then i tried their online system which worked, but the gal at the register tore off the previous order which listed a 2:41 pickup when mine was 12:30 so i had to wait when i was in a rush, and c) the damn avocado, one of the key ingredients, was missing from my california club.   

Shore it up please.   That's all."}
{"text":"A very tasty lunch or dinner option.  The portions are filling, and the meat and toppings are fresh and flavorful.  The French Fries are a perfect accompaniment.  Service is quick, selection is vast, and there are thousands of interesting soda choices, as well as fresh-brewed iced tea."}
{"text":"First time at Rocket Burger and Subs and we loved it! I had the turkey avocado and sprouts sub and it was bomb. Plus all the nostalgic sodas. I bought the Frosty orange and root beer. I live on the west side of town but definitely we'll be back. Steve the owner was very nice and very personable we enjoyed talking with him."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Sooooooo many hamburger combinations, my favorite is the Teriyaki burger, shoestring ff...and every brand of soda you can think of...."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today - good burgers, subs, wide variety of craft sodas. Biggest drawback was lack of seating, I think there were 3 booths inside and 3-4 tables outside.  Business was constant but lack of seating  was a big drawback to us"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Been searching for a solid burger place since I moved here, and I found one! Rockets Burger and Subs is probably one of the best burger restaurant I've been too in a long time! It's a hole in wall, but that's where the best food comes from! The place is small, but very well maintained and clean! The burgers are beyond amazing! The burgers are freshly cooked and well seasoned! All the toppings are freshly added to your burger! The buns do get a little soggy over a short period of time, but the taste makes up for that! Hard to beat this place for pure quality of food and affordability. If there was a \"Yelp hidden gem\" of the year award, they would be nominated! Recommend this place for lunch, dinner or anytime you crave a burger!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing burgers. I've never been disappointed. They carry a wide variety of sodas as well, from all over the world. It's kind of a small spot, or a hole in the wall. Even if you're not hungry, stop in and grab a weird/strange soda!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally did last night. The burger itself was pretty good. It's not going to replace my normal go-to places but I would definitely go back for another one. The fried zucchini and cheese curds were both pretty meh. I ended up tossing the cheese curds and only ate a few of the zucchini before they got ditched too. Both were insanely salty. The staff were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is a chain of two locations, so I am told. The menu  is broad enough. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger combo. The French fries were limp, as if they had been sitting for some time. The cheeseburger was good and filling, as was the ice tea. 

The big negative is limited seating. Only three booths inside with 4 two person tables outside in the sun. 

Will give it some thought about returning, seating limitations is the real concern, even with small group."}
{"text":"Cali burger is delicious! Soft serve ice-cream twist half and half style! Huge drink selection including slush puppies what what!!!!"}
{"text":"Great local place. Excellent burgers, sandwiches and sodas."}
{"text":"When my fiance and I decided to go to Rocket Burger, I was extremely excited about it...she, being a vegetarian, was not.  

We got there, and I'll admit, from the outside looking in, and even once inside the door, I was a little put off.  I wasn't sure I wanted to stay there and eat.  All that changed once we got a good dose of the service (and food)!  

She ordered some pizza bread, with pretty much every non-meat topping available, and some cheese fries with no chili.  I ordered a Chicago dog with chili fries (no cheese).  

We got a few drinks from their AMAZING soda selection.  She got two of the original Dr. Peppers, and I got a Leninade.  She ended up hating the Dr. Pepper because it used real sugar, and drank my Leninade...a taste of things to come once married I suspect.

The pizza bread, according to her, was delicious.  The fries, superb.  

My dog was amazing.  I expected the actual hot dog to be a little bigger, but with all the things you get on the dog, it's a real meal.  I ate that, and some of the fries (which were really really good...though I should have gotten the chili cheese fries instead of just chili) and was stuffed.  

The people that work there are very friendly.  They brought the food to us rather than just calling out our names, offered to exchange the unopened Dr. Pepper for something different since she didn't care for it, and had good humor when my fiance made a joke about them not having veggieburgers.  

The only thing holding it back from being 5 stars is that the tables needed wiped off."}
{"text":"Food: Burgers are ridiculous! If you want a burger with hot pastrami and special sauce this place has it. They have a variety of weirdly but awesome combinations of burgers and for the price it's better then any \"Fast Food\" burger. They also have other type subs like their French Dip is amazing and comes with a side of fantastic au jus for dipping. Let's talk about the ginormous variety of sodas from all over, their coolers take up most of the space to display all the sodas. Gotta try if you are craving a burger.

Decor: not much to say but it looks very much like a liquor store that sells burgers in the back of the store.

Service: Counter Service but friendly, willing to help you find something you'd like.

Overall: I like the Burgers but will probably take it Togo. Not really a place you want hang out in."}
{"text":"The California burger is amazing! My new favorite burger place. Everything is fresh and the employees are so friendly! This place is a hidden gem in Chandler!"}
{"text":"I had an awesome Italian sandwich and root beer float.  I overheard the guy at the table next to us say the burger he was eating was the best burger he ever had.  I'll be back to cheek out the burgers..."}
{"text":"So I was at the ER in Chandler and needed a quick meal. Found this place and I sure am glad I did. I got the gyro sandwich, an order of onion rings, and one each of their cookies. I am now back waiting in the ER and I can't wait till I can go back to try something else. The food is excellent, the staff is very friendly, and the place is very clean. I don't give five stars out often, but this place deserves it."}
{"text":"Outstanding place,  Slush Puppies, Craft Soda,  fresh shoestring cut fries....  

Large Italian,  fresh deli meats,  toppings,  provolone cheese was great n fresh hoagie bun..  toasted,  and was down right great.. 

New Yorker,  what the whattt,  usually not a huge fan of pastrami,  but this may be my #2 sammich now..  awesome slaw,  swiss cheese, n rocket suace..  I suggest u try it..  toasted as well.. 

Snoozeberry soda was great,  fries feshly cut shoestring,  little undercooked,  but,  take out didn't notice till home n still ate them all..  

Across street pretty much,  will try burger sub n philly cheesesteak next..  cheers n kudos,  keep up the great food."}
{"text":"Would give 3.5 stars if I could.  Came here looking for a great burger, fries and shake and left a little disappointed.  My burger was excellent but the single patty was paper thin.  Didn't look at all like some of the recent photos posted.  The fries were fine, nothing special.  The shake was I guess what you'd expect for $2.99."}
{"text":"A small independent burger joint with unique menu. It's stuck in the small shopping center behind the fried chicken place, on the corner. If you didn't know what you where looking for, you would miss it. You'd best not however, because it's that good! 

The menu is a mix of burgers, sandwiches and hot dogs. You can have fries or onion rings, and then there is your drink selection, that's where you can be sure of having some fun making up you mind. If you are a fan of nostalgia and love the old and new, you can rest assured that they will have something that will satisfy both. There is everything from cream soda's to root beer, they even have chocolate soda! 

I had the classic bacon cheese burger with onion rings. The burger was cooked just right with extra crispy pieces of bacon melted cheese, lettuce, tomato and pickles. The onion rings was coated with corn meal batter and fried to golden brown. It was a great choice. 

The locals seemed to be happy, service was great, and owner seemed genuinely interested in who was eating at his place and how we had discovered it. Overall, a good burger and well worth coming back for!"}
{"text":"First of all don't judge a book by its cover. Most people would pass up the place from the outside. Which I guess is good for us locals! There are so many great things I can say about this place. First of all the burgers are amazing and quality is consistent. We have been going here since they opened and never have any issues. The staff is so friendly they know you by first name basis. If you are a bottle soda or flavored soda drinker this is the place for you. They have over 5 fridges full of selections to choose from. Now to the good stuff. I recommend that you try the After Burner burger. It is pepper jack cheese, jalapenos, this amazing mayo, and rocket relish...pretty much a pico de gallo. The Onion Rings and Fried Zucchini are coated perfectly and fried crisp not greasy. Don't forget to ask for the ranch it is also a customer favorite. Another good burger is the Cali burger which has fresh avocados on it. They have daily specials as well. Now for dessert don't forget to get a brownie that they make or a chocolate milk shake. For the kid in you they also have slush puppies they remind me of my childhood. 

I would say the main reason we go back is the vibe of the restaurant. They are like your family and they make you feel at home. They are the reason you go back!! Keep up the great work Rocket Burger!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner!!!! This was my first time eating here. The place is hard to find, with road construction all around the complex.  I walked in and ordered the cheeseburger combo with fries. I asked for no salt, seasoning salt, or \"Rocket Sauce\". At first they looked at odds with my request. Then, I told them that I am highly allergic to MSG and don't want to take my chances. They were immediately responsive and said they understood.  I went to pour my soda and as soon as I sat down, my meal was being placed in front of me.  The cheeseburger was prepared exactly as ordered.  The fries were fresh cut, crispy brown, tasty, and salt free. Fantastic.  I only regret that I didn't order the double party cheeseburger.  I now have a new \"go-to\" burger joint! The owner is very friendly and personable.  He takes pride in his work.  Good job!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is excellent, the eddie burger and meatball sub have been my favorites so far. The chilli cheese fries are incredible, and the onion rings are awesome! You can tell a lot of love is put into this food, and if I go out to eat I drive 20 minutes out of my way to go to Rocket Burger. Absolutely love this place, and the soda selection is incredible!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the Ghost Burger and expected it to be spicier, but it was still awesome. The Rocket Fries are fantastic. I took off one star because the cashier guy wasn't the friendliest, but the rest of the staff was."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Today I had the Baja Burger with added Smoky Ghost Pepper Jack Cheese and the burger was simply amazing. I've been 3 times so far and each time I leave very satisfied. It's a hard place to find with no signs on the street, but once you find it, you'll never forget. Although I love both the burgers and sandwiches, I am not the biggest fan of their fries and would probably opt to get a different side than fries."}
{"text":"I love this place but without the owner being here the service sucks and the food sucks. I will be back like always but just hope they can get some consistency"}
{"text":"I am so grateful to say I have had the famous Rocket Burger.  This place gets so much Yelp praise and for great reason.  

The soda selection is off the hook every soda you grew up with and then some all in coolers in bottles the even got YooHoo.

Fries are all natural cut and amazing there is just something great about fries with the skin on them they just taste better. 

The burger was Phenomenal I had the Santa Fe which had the amazing Rocket Sauce, bacon, and fried green chili.  It was outta this world good.  

I will be a loyal customer and I am sure will post numerous updates to this review cause this place is just that good."}
{"text":"I usually don't get excited about burgers but this place was really good. I got the double cheeseburger and my husband got the Chicago BURGER, chili dog, and why not some chili fries. 
Food came out super hot. Fries were hot. So you know they're fresh. Chili had a nice spice to it. 
I wasn't a fan of the raw onion on my burger but everything else was delish. Typically I don't eat the bun because it gets all soggy but this one was good. 
The wide selection of craft sodas was a fun touch! Definitely will be back. Service was great and place was clean."}
{"text":"5.4.3.2.1. Get ready for your taste buds to blast off!

Their menu makes ordering super easy.. it's not rocket science.

Actually.. deciding between the Eddie Lopez, and Cali Burger could be a real challenger."}
{"text":"Ehhh, I don't get it. It took me a minute to find it since its tucked behind a Church's Chicken. The employees were pleasant enough but the food was not good.

My burger was mushy and sloppy. The pickles even tasted weird and I love pickles. The fries were pretty gross. Undercooked and soggy. I was really disappointed because usually Yelp is spot on. I wish I had picked another place to eat while in Phoenix for the night."}
{"text":"We loved Rocket Burger!! What a fun place. The soda selection is crazy good and so cool that you get to make everything a float. We had the Rueben and a spicy burger. We were so impressed at how great everything tasted. I love it when local places are great!"}
{"text":"Awesome Burger Joint. I've been here about 10 times now and can tell they serve some outstanding burgers and sandwiches. All the service pros are welcoming and seem happy to be there and serve.  Their soda \"pop\" selection is unreal. You look at all these different sodas and you can't help but feel you are in a \"way back\" machine."}
{"text":"Not too sure about Phoenix folks tastes in burgers.  2nd 4.5 star joint in a row that was meh!

Seeing is the name of this place is \"Rocketburger\", that is exactly what I got.  I ordered a Rocketburger with cheese and a fountain drink.  My total was just under $12.00.  Here is how it was..........

Rocketburger with cheese-  Meh.  This thing came with 3 patties, lettuce, tomato, onions and cheese.  It also had pickles and a \"rocket sauce\" aka thousand island.  The bun was a sub type roll and was fine.  All the ingredients were not that great though.  The burgers were way way way too salty, small and didn't taste good. The dressing had a weird \"tang\" to it also.  The cheese and bun were the only good things about it.  At around $10.00, I was dissapointed.  My mouth was swollen dry afterwards because of the salt!  Never again!  I ate the whole thing but would never get another one.

Diet Pepsi-  This was partly my bad.  They have 1000 or so bottled sodas for sale but I chose a fountain drink.  The Diet Pepsi was nasty!   The worst fountain soda I have ever had.  Tasted like root beer mixed with dirty water.   So nasty!

The guy at the counter and the guy who brought me my burger were friendly.  The food was below average and pricey,  and the soda was straight up nasty! Unfortunately I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food. Rocket size is enough for multiple meals. I love the selection of bottled soda. Don't forget to check in to get 10% off."}
{"text":"Groupons are great and lead me to fun new places like this.  Went today for lunch- Teriyaki and Cali burgers, plus fries and one of the many bottled sodas they offer (vanilla creme).  The burgers were slightly smaller than at other burger places I've been to, but still more than enough.  Fries are freshly cut and yummy.  Prices are very reasonable and the owners were nice."}
{"text":"This is a place you want to take visiting friends. It looks like a hole in the wall in a sad strip mall, but it doesn't let you down. The burgers themselves aren't super special, but the topping combos are killer. The Santa Fe burger, with a whole fried green chile on top, is a sight to be seen. The fries are surprisingly delicious and have the skins still intact. They remind me of the fries at Five Guys, which I think is a really good thing. Last time we went I decided to try the subs, and I would heartily recommend you do the same. I was feeling something a little more traditional, so I tried their Reuben. The sauerkraut wasn't too overwhelming, the dressing was perfect, and there was a ton of melted cheese. Mmm. I will warn you though: Whatever you get is going to require a LOT of napkins, and possibly a knife and fork. This isn't a place to take a dainty eater.

Their selection of pop (yeah, I said pop) is insane. All of them are priced the same. No stressing out over picking one out before ordering and wondering how much each costs. And after you're done eating, go next door to the pop-only storefront and pick up a 4 or 6 pack to go. I asked the owner how many different varieties he has, and he said right now it's 700+, so the choice won't be easy, but you'll come away with some interesting varieties. I picked up a rhubarb soda, and a espresso soda last time, along with the key lime one I had with my meal."}
{"text":"Bacon cheeseburger was perfection. The meat was tender and juicy, cooked to medium perfection, the bacon was crispy and the right proportion to the beef. The lettuce was very finely shredded, onions were diced and blended well with the lettuce to add just the right amount to each bite. The bun was toasted lightly but still fluffy. 

The onion rings were very good... corn meal breading that was light and crispy, the onion was soft but didn't pull out of the breading. 

The cheese curds were amazing.  They were small, breading was very light and crispy.

The wall of soda is diverse and has something for everyone. I chose the Blenheim Ginger Ale pink cap (the spicier one). I was assisted with my choice which was great because I didn't know the difference between the options.

Staff was knowledgeable and very courteous.  The place has a bright and cheerful environment with \"old timey\" soda advertisement signs."}
{"text":"Nice little hidden jewel.  Had the double cheese burger, fresh ingredients loved the pickles and the bun, you cant go wrong with it.  Also had the Chili Dog it was great, i agree with the other reviewer that it kicks Sonic's butt.  Cant wait to try the subs the Roast Beast looks intriguing!"}
{"text":"Such a great variety of sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs and SODAS! I usually always get two bottles of unique soda, one to drink and one for my collection at home"}
{"text":"Typical diner look but a wall of frig doors loaded with different sodas. Had the pescado sandwich which is a monster size cornmeal crusted tilapia fillet with slaw, crudo, and salsa on a soft bun, also served with a large amount of seasoned fries everything piping hot.  To drink had the fountain crafted root beer nice."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers that I have ever had. The customer service was really great. Everyone was very friendly and the food was bomb."}
{"text":"Definitely a divey environment and unless you heard of this place from others or online, you would not see this place just driving by because it's tucked away in a large plaza. There's only 3 booths and a couple of tables outside so if you come here for dinner, don't be surprised if you have to eat outside in the dark as there's no lightning outside. Obviously you won't be eating outside forever like a sit-down restaurant, but it's definitely not appealing with your dinky phone flashlight on with car lights shining on you as they park in and out.

They offer the option of 1, 2 or 3 patties but I feel like that might be a mistake because they use the same bun for every burger. Not sure if you've seen the pictures posted by others, but these buns are surprisingly substantial themselves. The patties aren't thick either, but the thin kind. Thus, if you get 1 patty like me, even with the added pastrami and other toppings, the bun to burger ratio isn't right and the beef gets lost - making it feel like you're just eating bread and veggie toppings. For a moment there, I got a glimpse of what being a vegetarian was like and I felt like dying quick death. So definitely need to order 2 or 3 patties, no if's, ands, or buts about it. 

Unfortunately I have to say that if you're looking for a non-chain burger shop, go to Lenny's. Those burgers are worth driving into suicidal Central Phoenix traffic for (they have a couple of other locations as well). If you're ok with a chain, Fuddruckers will appease you more, even if they don't have the 20-something different combinations this place offers. Definitely give this place a try, but heed my tips and warnings above.

Also, the girl at the register is amazing customer service wise :)"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. We ordered the Italian sub and the New Yorker and both were not that great. We only ate half of the sandwich. We also ordered fries which were greasy. The portion was huge so you can share them. I was grossed out and bloated all day from eating there. They do have a large assortment of different sodas. When we were there the soda fountain was leaking and the floor was wet.  All around the bottom of the walls is dirty which is gross. Maybe they are known for their burgers. I won't be going back to find out though."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the menu, my lunch and the kind people who work here."}
{"text":"Great tasking burgers and fries!!! This place doesn't use processed meat and junk to feed you, it really is quality. The flavor is amazing and makes me feel like I'm eating healthy while indulging in my favorite burger!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Had the double bacon cheeseburger with fries and onion rings. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"My goodness, i totally underestimated the size of their \"Rocket\" sized sandwiches, which are a meal and a half.  I would totally go there again but this time spend a lot less knowing that im going to be more than satisfied with one Rocket sized meal.  They have a ton of variety, and i tried their Mexican sandwich which was great."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am trying to not write this review with my emotions, but to hell with it; Best Burger in Phoenix!
I have sampled an array of the offerings and I proclaim them all to be of better than decent quality, some are in fact astoundingly crafted to be in a high range of quality. My primary example of this is the New York Burger, which is a layer of pastrami a layer of cole slaw and a slice of really delicious cheese on the already amazing all-beef burger. The bread is also noticeably awesome here, the sub rolls are soft yet sturdy for stacking meats onto and the burger buns are to die for.
If I let this review go by without mentioning the fried zucchini it would be a crime against having good taste in the realm of food. The zuke is breaded and tastes very fresh, it is expertly packaged so as to not get mushy and the presentation is very appetizing to the eyes. 
I need at least one of these burgers a month in order so that I do not devolve into madness. 
I work in food prep and I can say that I recognize all the details they put into their food at Rocket Burger. I will leave the surprising selection of soda and bottled beverages for you to experience on your own as it adds to the charm of the establishment. 
A high five to the crew and owners for getting it right."}
{"text":"huge selection of burgers. The wait was a bit long but was def worth it. I would rather wait a few more minutes and have a great tasting burger than get it sooner and have it taste not so great. My nephew got the rocket. It is a sub sandwich but the contents of the inside of a hamburger. It was huge! excited to come back and try a different creation."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to write a review about a restaurant but this place is AMAZING!  I ordered the Mexican Burger which was probably one of the most delicious burgers I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. Not only was the food amazing the staff was super friendly and courteous even after I knocked my drink over.  

They are a little hard to find as they are tucked in the back in the corner of a building complex.  But if you do find this little gem eatery you will not be disappointed. You can taste all the love they invest into their food,  even if your not hungry swing by and check out there unmatched soda collection."}
{"text":"It's a strange phenomenon that happens so very rarely, where something is redone, a song or movie for example, and ends up better than the source material -- 

*More Real Than The Original*

...Buffy the Vampire Slayer television show vs. movie  

...Jimi Hendrix vs. Bob Dylan All Along The Watchtower (even Dylan admitted it was Jimi's song now)

There is a restaurant concept sweeping the valley right now, based on a certain small number (between 1 and 3) of people of a certain philosophy (free-wheeling, nature-loving, noodly-music-listening) and their crazy atmosphere establishments full of odd \"paraphernalia\".

Well, think about how one of those places got your hopes up and then  left them dashed, and head on over to Rocket Burgers & Subs for everything you thought you'd get with those other guys:

~A fresh, clean, uncluttered atmosphere that you can sit comfortably inside of while enjoying your meal.
~A HUGE selection of almost any kind of soft drink you'd desire to quench that thirsty, dry mouth of yours.
~Lots of variety of menu, all with inexpensive good quality items of decent portion
~A radio playing the xmsirius Grateful Dead Channel for your soothing/stimulating dining pleasure.
~and a couple of really nice, friendly, hippy-on-the-inside-not-just-for-show restauranteurs eager to discuss their business and products, who are not only present now, but seem that they'll be sticking around to ensure the quality and value of their new place doesn't wane.

The food is fresh, fast, and inexpensive.  If you want burgers, subs, dogs, pizza-bread, gyro, salad, handmade fries &  onion rings, PBJ with homemade jam  -- they've got it.  The chicken sandwich had a light crispy breading and a solid chunk of breast meat.  The burger was a smaller patty (available as a double) but not dry, and the condiments were fresh and generous.  
For both sandwiches, the standout part was the fresh bun from Simply Bread (local).  It was soft/firm enough to be just right, and had great flavor.
They have a cooler chock full of interesting and bizarre selections from Pop The Soda Shop (Jones Soda, imported ginger ales and root beers, glass bottle real sugar sodas from mexico, dublin dr pepper, etc). My spicy Bleinheim Ginger Ale did not skimp on the ginger flavor!

A couple of real ex hippies would do it like this -- 
no flashy superficial emphasis on outward appearances and gimmicks, just quality, freshness, and friendliness that is truly genuine and sincere.
I feel like I made a new friend.
Rocket Burgers & Subs is one out of this world place, and I'm glad it landed in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place has some good burgers and the largest variety of sodas I have ever seen. They sell foreign sodas if you know any of them. Customer service is represented here and helped me out."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing bottled soda selection.  The people that work here are really nice and friendly.  The guy commented on my Seahawks shirt saying he himself is from the Seattle area.  The burger was amazing.  Melted cheese, tender beef and a great sauce that has a bit of a kick to it.  The fries are krinkle cut- nothing special but decent.  Any bottled soda you can imagine is here.  I got my food to go since the place is kind of small.  I hope that they franchise and start a few elsewhere around the valley- in bigger locations ;)"}
{"text":"Had a burger here a few months ago and it was really good. I love the selection of sodas as well."}
{"text":"May seem over priced for burgers but once you have any of there burgers your going to put down that big Mac or whopper for and Eddie Lopez burger. Just wish the frys could stand up to the burgers. The fried mushrooms are way too salty though"}
{"text":"I like this place, a lot. It's right behind Church's Chicken at Cactus and 35th Ave. This used to be a run-down strip mall, and this particular store was \"Latino Food Market\" and looked terrible inside. The 2 owners renovated it and started it up as \"Rocket Subs\" before changing it to its current name. Now, it looks bright and inviting.

They have Hebrew National hot dogs and a vast selection of soda, including the Mexican variety. The BLT sub I had was also very good. I've not had a chance to try the burgers. I recommend checking this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is very expletive good. It isn't a place that's high end where their cows get back massages and pedicures before getting slaughtered and cooked in some fancy french culinary term, it's better. Just when I thought their burgers were the best,
I tried my wife's teriyaki chicken sandwhich after I swallowed my burger and it was heavenly. We don't drink soda either but we always split one, vanilla cream is the best. I would eat here all day everyday, unfortunately my pants are already getting tighter lol. It's a solid 10. Go have some please. Guy fierri needs to go there ASAP."}
{"text":"This place has an Amazing soda selection.  I had the gyro burger it was great. We also ordered the Garlic Melt burger which was good as well. We will come back."}
{"text":"Bomb every time. Amazing cheese curds! Crazy AMMMMMAAAAAZZZZING crispy chicken salad the small a wide, yet very unique selection of sodas."}
{"text":"Good food but the draw for us were all the funky sodas! It was a fun place to try and the staff was super friendly and the burgers were good."}
{"text":"I write this review as my boyfriend is next to me in a food coma! He just got back from a hiking trip and wanted a burger and fries. So I jumped on Yelp to see what we could find. After looking at a few places, we decided on Rocket Burger and Subs. When we walked through the door we were greated right away. Something I look for and think is very important. We were amazed at the soda selection! Some sodas I've haven't seen in YEARS! They even have Slush Puppies!!! What???? Yeppers, they sure do! We both decided on the birch beer. Sooooo good! I went simple and got a cheeseburger and fries. BF got a pastrami with cole slaw sandwich and fries. I have to agree with most on here and say the food here is outstanding! Very fresh and full of flavor. The fries were not greasy nor the burgers salty. And I for one do not use or like salt very much. I love how the skin was left on the fries! Very yummy! We will definitely be back when we have a craving for really good burgers and fries! Oh and if you check in on Yelp you get 10% off!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome little burger and hot dog joint with a huge selection of different sodas as a nice little touch. All their burgers are huge and more than enough for one person, although we chose to splurge and grab onion rings with our meal. I've always been pretty fond of novelty and specialty sodas myself and it was awesome seeing a bunch of them at this little hole-in-the-wall burger joint.

Great place for some greasy, delicious fast food if you're craving some classic American burgers"}
{"text":"I was in the mood to try somewhere new and Yelp brought my husband and I here on his lunch break. Based on all of the reviews I'm going to say I either came on an off day or ordered the wrong thing. I just wasn't impressed? However, I didn't order a burger so that could have been my big glaring error. I ordered the California chicken sandwich and the taste of lime just overwhelmed the whole sandwich. Here's what I think happened - I asked the cashier if she recommended grilled or breaded and she said they were both good. Me, being the carbaholic that I am, ordered the breaded chicken and the breading soaked up all and any lime flavoring they would normally put on the grilled chicken.  Also, I wasn't crazy about the fries. I like my fries really crispy and these just weren't my thing. My husband, on the other hand, liked his standard cheeseburger and these were his kind of fries. I like more crisp where he likes more \"fry meat\" (that's what I call it) and that's okay.  Even though I didn't like my meal, the environment was super casual, the service was friendly and fast, and my husband didn't have any complaints. Also, they have a ton of sodas, I'm boring and just ordered a Coke but if I ever went back, I'd definitely take my time and try to look through all of the different sodas they have. It's intense."}
{"text":"Wow! This is my spot, this is definitely my jam and my wife even loves this place! It's really hard to find a place that has more cheeses than American cheese to put on your burger.

I've been here a lot... pretty much come here 1-3 times a week. We crave rocket burger on the regular.

Burgers are fantastic. The owner is personable and very nice. He seems to be here a lot! I love the recommendations on the soda choices he gives. Honestly can say they have the best burger in chandler for the price. We have had a couple burgers that were not to perfection, but still was satisfied. Love the rocket sauce on the side for dipping sauce and burger topping, it has a nice sweet taste to it.

I recommend the onion rings or chili cheese fries along with any burger or sandwich. Have yet to be disappointed on any main courses.Didn't particularly care for the cheese curds though.

I hear people rant and rave about this place as they are eating in the next booth, the vibe here is friendly. They always have a special going on.

So many craft sodas to choose from! Small little place but packs a big punch! They seem to get you in and out quickly. I like that it's never packed but has a steady stream of customers.

Keep up the good work rocket burger"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been here several times and ordered several different things and everything has been great! Their fried zucchini and cheese curds are super tasty.  The staff here is also really friendly, informed on the menu and willing to help with suggesstions. Also the wall of soda!!! It's amazing, anything you could possibly want! Plus they have some homemade sodas on tap."}
{"text":"Vroom Vroom!  That's the sound of my red rocket taking off when I took the first bite of my California Chicken sandwich! This place is the real deal! 

I ordered the California chicken sandwich with some fries. The chicken was fried and juicy, cooked perfectly. The bacon was nice and crispy as well. It also came with avocado, and being from Arizona, naturally I love avocado. 

They have an awesome selection of different craft sodas. There must have been about 300 different ones to choose from. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time today with the grand kids burgers and fries were great BLT was good too. Nice friendly helpful staff"}
{"text":"If your a soda fan, this is your place.  Must have 200 different kinds of bottled soda.  Fried veggies are fresh and hand battered, very good.   Burgers were decent, but patties seemed like they were previously frozen or maybe just overcooked.  They looked like preformed frozen patties.  Food came out pretty fast and pretty good price.  I would try it again if I wanted a quick fast food meal and a new variety of soda."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff!! Came here for lunch with BFFs, at 10:30am (they open early, bonus!)  I had a great (but greasy) Reuben. Girlfriends ended up eating their burgers with a knife and fork... but they ate them happily!.  Generous amount of fries but not my favorite.. not sure how to describe them but I would go with chips next time (and I generally love fries).  The place has a whole cooler of just root beer, all different brands of course, and 2 additional coolers of every flavor of soda you could think of and then some, including retro sodas like Bubble Up. Overall, nice little place. Seems to get good traffic, even at 10:30 am. But this location has been needing a lunch place like this for a long time! Its not health food, but its good and I will be back.  Just gotta load up on the napkins."}
{"text":"Aren't the sketchiest places some of the best? I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak, and I was pleasantly surprised. The meat was seasoned deliciously. I would have preferred lettuce on it though... (weird huh?) any who, the price is decent for what you pay for. The only downside to this place though is that it's really small, and it gets crowded quick (beware if you have claustrophobia). I'm definitely going to back to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Although their prices are a little steep for burgers they are worth it. I got the Philly cheese steak burger and it was to die for.... no for real I think I had a heart attack eating all that grease. but all jokes aside it was everything A burger should be! Can't wait to try some of the other menu items. I just wish they serve their cheese curds with marinara sauce"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for the weekend. We were taking my sister out to eat and wanted good burgers. We found our place! And they have an awesome assortment of sodas. We found 'Ski' which is locally bottled in our home town in IL -- we were so excited!!!"}
{"text":"this place is so amazing!!!!!!!!!! clean, super friendly, and the food omg the food. we were a sketched out by the area, but the best places always look like dives. We go in and the menu was clear, and the prices were awesome. We got a double new york burger, and cali burger, and a regular burger, onion rings, chili cheese fries, and 3 soda's, for 33.00! That is pretty awesome. the burgers are a good size, and perfect. The onion rings were amazing, and my husband devoured the chili cheese fries. What we really loved was the soda selection. I think we spent a majority of the time trying to decide what we wanted. my husband got candied bacon cream soda and it was amazing. I can without a doubt say we will be back here, and that this is our new favorite place! Go check it out!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After going to SmashBurger and not getting my burger smashed, I was not surprised when the burgers here were not actually made out of rockets. Interstellar is one of my favorite movies of all time and I wanted to feel like Matthew McConaughey blasting off into space as I ate. Unfortunately, my burger made me feel more like Anne Hathaway, which is weird because I've never been in love with Captain Edmunds, although I do agree that his planet shows the most promise. Still it was a pretty decent burger.

The atmosphere makes me feel like I'd traveled back in time about 50 years. This is, of course, possible with the help of some 4th dimensional beings, AKA ourselves in the future. If I could travel back in time to the day I ate at Rocket Burger, I would order another burger."}
{"text":"Honestly havent had a burger \"WOW\" me in quite a while.... his little hole in the wall was precisely what I had hoped for. I had the Rocket style (3 patties on a 10 inch roll) Cali burger that has bacon, avocado and rocket sauce, bread is toasted with butter so its not soggy, you can order your burger Med or well done which is a nice touch. My daughter had the corn dogs and even those were surprisingly really good. Go to this place now! Fries are actually great :)

PS. They have something like 500 bottles of flavored soda, check it out if its your thing"}
{"text":"Good homemade burger join with hand-cut fries and fresh bread. Everything is made to order and very tasty. They have a huge selection of sodas if that's your thing. I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Onion rings are good. The breading is very light and salty. Most definitely Not heavy like other places."}
{"text":"\"I've always been obsessed with making a perfect hamburger.  There's nothing more American than a burger.\" ? Michael Symon

Do you guys know of Kate M. on Yelp from Chandler, AZ?  If you don't, go add her.  She has great reviews, posts yummy pictures, has funny check-in comments, and she likes to make fun of old people who plays Bingo.  Now why am I bringing her up again?  Oh yeah, she makes me try new places like Rocket Burger!

As soon as you get out of the car, the smell of grilled burgers hits you.  Yaaas...  The three of us ordered two Bacon Cheese Burgers [cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, and rocket sauce], a Sante Fe Burger [lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, cheese, fried green chili, bacon, rocket sauce], an order of Chili Cheese fries, and some Onion Rings.  The burger I had was a bacon cheese burger.  It hit the spot!  It had the perfect amount of char and was perfectly pink and juicy.  The chili fries stayed warm and cheesy even though we dined al fresco in 50°F weather this fine Friday evening.  The onion rings were also interesting.  The onion rings had a hard coating of cornmeal so be warned if you're expecting something else.  Along with a wide selection of interesting bottled sodas, they also have Batch Craft Soda as a fountain drink.  I dig it!

All in all, it's a great little shop [like three-tables-inside little] with a kind staff.  We were offered many apologies for having to eat outside since the dining area was full but that only speaks on how loved this place is.  My suggestion is to come during the off-peak hours!"}
{"text":"It was a really good flat iron burger we decided to stop on our way through town and had been wanting to try their burgers. They were tasty and juicy not over cooked and the flavor was very good. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"There is something special about having a whole wall dedicated to bottled soda. It really make my mouth light up with joy. This is what makes this whole in the wall memorable. I went for one of the blue cream sodas and really enjoyed it. Price wasn't too bad either. 
The food on the other hand... Well my bf would be able to make a more impressive sandwich. The ingredients seemed fresh and of good quality, but my sandwich, the turkey special for the day, was definitely lacking in the sauce department. Which was sad because it was a spicy root beer BBQ sauce, and what I could taste of it was spot on. 
Would have asked for extra sauce on the side, but the folks working there weren't very friendly or approachable. Seemed like there was some tension in the air. Maybe they were having a bad day..."}
{"text":"I  dont leave very many reviews on yelp i mostly read them and then  I check out the place but I came here since I read great reviews.  I ordered the cheeseburger special for 6.99 which comes with frys and a drink. Which is a pretty good deal compaired to some fast food places.  I got my burger took the first bite and the bottom of the bun was soggy which I'm guessing was from the onion or lettuce but that just ruined the burger for me who wants to eat a soggy bun. I still ate half which was good. The fries were soggy greesy too but I like them like that just don't like potato skins on them but not too bad since they had good ranch.  I noticed they use grub hub for delivery which is cool if you wanted it delivered. Maybe I will give them another try just a bad day I guess."}
{"text":"Decent burgers not over priced like a lot of places but it also wasn't as good as a friend had led me to believe so I was slightly disappointed."}
{"text":"Authentic.  This place is authentic.  They do what they do really well, and their customer base knows it and appreciates it.  Come here for an enormous selection of handcrafted rootbeers, creme sodas, and more.  Pair those with traditional American lunch items like burgers, dogs, fries, rings, etc.  Simple enough.  Good tasting, reasonably priced.

Tucked behind a Church's fried chicken.  Service was friendly.  Too bad cheese curds were termporarily out of stock!"}
{"text":"Rocket burger has been on my bookmark/bucket list of places to try and this was my first time here today.  I got the cheese burger special for 4.99 includes fries and a drink , plus the 10% off if you check in through yelp . The cheeseburger had really good flavor it was dressed with the usual and what made it so special was the burger sauce. The sauce had a little bit of a kick , not too much but enough to make you want more. The only negative is the bun was too thick for my taste, but I ripped the inside of the bun and enjoyed the burger . The fries seems to be hand cut and I think they are cooked in some kind of veggie oil like Crisco.  They looked better than they tasted. Then again everyone has their own preference in what they think is a good French fry. Who knows it might be your cup of tea. Oh and by the way they had a crazy cool collection of soda pop."}
{"text":"HOLY COW! An entire WALL of frosty specialty drinks?!?! Are you kidding!?!  I had a standard cheeseburger and it was phenomenal. The service was great- the flourescent green sodas that my kids chose from the wall were good. Weird, but good. Had a great time here with the family, will definitely go back the next time we are all in the mood for burgers and sodas."}
{"text":"Had the Red White and Blue burger with a second patty, extra pickles and the fries. The blue was blue cheese, the red a pepper and the white a jalapeno mayo type sauce.  The burger was awesome, I'd skip the fries next time and just go with a third burger patty. They also have hundreds of kinds of bottled soda, if that's your thing (it;s not mine, but was interesting to look."}
{"text":"Not much I can say that hasn't been mentioned already. I really like when the owner takes the time to come out and see if your enjoying your meal like this guy does, really nice guy. Food is great and the soda selection is super cool, the prices are very reasonable. You will spend MORE at the drive thru so instead go give your hear earned $$ to a local joint who appreciates the business."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been living close to this place for a while now.  We've seen it coming home more than a few times.  Tonight we jumped here on Yelp and saw they were rated pretty high and decide this was the place for dinner.  

I got the gyro burger combo with French fries and a sarsaparilla and my wife got the Cali Burger and onion rings.  Everything was fantastic.  They have a huge selection of pops that you won't find anywhere else.  Everything we had was great.  The French Fries and the onion rings were some of the best around.

If you are hankering for a good burger joint, this is definitely a good place to go."}
{"text":"Every time I house sit for my friend Keith, I eat at Rocket Burger. Partly because it's just down the street, but mostly because a good burger is a great way to end the day. I've never had a bad burger here. The chili cheese fries are pretty great. The fish sandwich is good but messy to eat by hand.

I don't drink soda, but if I did this place would be like heaven: a monterous  selection of carbonated beverages lines the back wall."}
{"text":"I go here all the time and keep coming back trying new stuff.  I'll probably make it through the menu someday... don't let text the outside discourage you!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem of a place! This has become a regular for me and my daughter: pedicure/manicure and Rocket Burger! Lol

The menu is great with something for everyone. Portions are generous but the really neat thing (there's many at this place) is that they sell bottled drinks! I love the butterscotch sodas and my daughter goes for the red cream sodas! Over 100 types I'm sure! 

The food- amazing! I've had the small Rueben and it is a generous size. I haven't been able to finish it. I've even ordered to go for my husband. He's a hard sell and said the Santa Fe Burger was hands down the best burger he's ever had! 

Prices aren't bad, great food. The only downside is there are only 3 booths. You may want to get it to go if seating is tight. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"O boy I just discovered ROCKET BURGERS &SUBS. TOTALLY AWESOME!!!! This is the first time in a long while I drank 7-up from a bottle...tha fries are the bomb too!!!!!"}
{"text":"Total gem hole in the wall. Flash back to the 80s...best burgers you'll find. Parking s a pain but it's well worth it I promise!!"}
{"text":"Wish this place existed in Irvine!  Great menu and selection of menu items and yummy burger sandwich options!  Kids loved the mini corn dogs and selecting of craft sodas!  Will go back when in Arizona for sure!"}
{"text":"What a fun find! I can't really add much that the other reviewers have not already said. Come by and check out the antique soda market. They own the one next door too. If you want to find a soda brand from your hometown and or your Glory Days of past, or not so Glory Days of past, they probably have it. 

The turkey sub was pretty good and the staff were extra nice. Hi Ruth! Ruth even gave me a small Yelp discount which was super nice of her. She did not have to do that because I did not buy the whole combo. I will definitely be going back to this fun place to try a burger too."}
{"text":"Love me some Rocket Burger! As a family we usually go on a Saturday for lunch. I would give 5 stars but the parking is tight and recently there has been a storage container next to Church's Chicken which makes it even tighter. 

My husband and I both usually get a bacon cheeseburger but this time I ventured outside my box and ordered the Thai chicken sandwich special. it came on the signature bun that is great and always fresh but never seems to hold up and at the end of the burger it falls apart..but I'm not complaining!

Sandwich was a real chicken breast breaded and fried with a spicy peanut sauce and a spicy slaw. Sandwich was amazing. Now I will be torn on what to order on future visits.

Hubs bacon burger is just that. A bacon burger, single patty with fresh customary burger toppings. Fries are always hot and freshly cut.

We also love the hundreds of bottled soda collection but find it a little pricey at $1.99 a bottle.

Rocket Burger is a great break from chain burgers and blows  most of them out of the water. Be prepared during busy times to wait for a table or clean your own."}
{"text":"GROSS! What a waste of $20! If you're looking for a good burger... this is NOT the place!"}
{"text":"I visit Rocket Burger several times a month. Not as often as I would like. 
There are many reasons I go there. The food is good and the people that own the place and the workers are the best. 
We go there to eat and visit.
The nicest people you could ever meet. We try to go in the off hours so we have some time to talk with the owners and workers. 
Go in and say Hi. Again the food is good and the people are the nicest you can find anywhere."}
{"text":"I think this place qualifies as a dive. In a good way. Not much on decor and located behind a Church's Chicken which is very hard to find the restaurant.

 if you are into different kind of sodas this is your heaven. Not only different kind of soda for display but to drink.

Had the Eddie Lopez Single Burger which was a burger with Pastrami. Was pretty good and a solid bun to hold the burger together.  The fries were on the soggy side which I personally prefer to be crisp. 

The soda selection is second to none and really overwhelming but if you want to try something new and different this is the place. 

Would like to come back to try a hot dog or a sub which both look great. 

Overall come for the food and not the decor, this could easily be a candidate for diners drive ins and dives.

Good find and good food, I like these kind of unique places. Will be back again"}
{"text":"So worth the drive! It's about 1 1/2 drive from where I live, but we had to come to Phoenix anyways. I'm glad we stop by this unique burger joint... I had the AfterBurner Burger & Onion Rings also got the Pizza Bread... Yummy! I was starving ok lol. My fiancé got a Fish Sandwhich and Fries he said it's like the best Fish Sandwich he's had. My little ones had the mini corn dogs & fries. So we enjoyed our self and the owners are really nice..."}
