{"text":"The high reviews here are mind blowing. This place is terrible. Decor is nice... But that's about it. Went here a few weeks ago with a large group and had the fixed price menu.. The food was dreadful. Appetizers were fried pickles and this salad that was mostly just large pieces of lettuce (took 45 minutes to get to the table). Main was a brisket sandwich (which was OK, but took an hour to get to the table). Dessert was a doughnut. (Only took 30 minutes to get to the table because of some complaints). I honestly feel that they were delaying our meals in order to keep selling us drinks. The rest of the restaurant was empty for the most part.  Several of the beers were also unavailable... 

I'm not sure if the management changed over the last few months but this place is on a downward trajectory. I went here about a year ago for brunch and it was great. No idea what happened.

Also... For the love of all that is holy, get a new french fry recipe. They are barely edible. They are like 5 inches thick and soggy/soft. How can you mess up fries?"}
{"text":"Fun place a couple of blocks away (in a good way) from the financial core. Great beer and wide enough selection of dishes (at both lunch and dinner) to keep everyone happy. Loved the donut for dessert."}
{"text":"Batch has a really nice, unique look. A bit rustic beach cottage nautical I guess. And even though its a Molson bar undercover as a craft brewery, they seem legit and earnest and have some local small guys in cans/bottles.

I had the burger. F-ing awesome! My only remark would be a bit less salt and a bit more of that sweet onion relish (or whatever it was!). A really sharp cheddar would set it off. But the beef is top quality, coarse grind, cooked to order perfection. Bun was soft and fluffy and warm with a slightly crispy shell. It just felt \"right\" to hold it.

Fries were very thick cut...more like roasted potatos, served with a homemade ketchup. If this is your thing, great, but i like my fries crispy and my ketchup trashy. Salad next time.

Theyve got a wicked event room: pingpong, tv, arcade games, a bar, communal style tables, all beside the brewing area and open kitchen. It would tightly seat maybe 60 people. However: $3,000 minimim spend. If you have 100 people (which would be very tight) thats 30/head which is fine. But its more like under 50 would be comfortable, so 60+/head which is a bit much. Also the bartender told me *one* server works your party and doesnt leave the bar because its \"too hard.\" If its a 3000$ preordered bill it isnt hard. Take names and credit cards, dont be lazy, and dont be greedy, put 2 servers (15% of 3000 = 450)."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent! I ordered the turkey burger with fries. Turkey was juicy and fries were massive. 

Also had their own brewed beer sampler but I didn't enjoy it. The flavours were too intense."}
{"text":"Batch: where the beers are cold, the service is slow and the food is terrible

I'm not sure where to start with this review: service or food. We had issues with both this past weekend at my first (and last) visit to Batch. 

SERVICE
My friend and I were seated at our table, while we waited for our other friends to arrive. After being seated, no one came over to ask us for our drink order (we waited about 20 mins), so we ordered directly from the bar (note: it wasn't busy in the restaurant at the time.) We ended up ordering directly from the bar most of the night, since the service was painfully slow.
Once our friends arrived (table of 10), we placed our orders at around 8pm. By 9pm, we were still waiting for our food to arrive. 

FOOD
Most of us got our food at the same time (just after 9pm), although one of our friends waited about another 15 mins for her fish fingers. I guess that extra time was required to cook them to point of being nearly inedible. They were overcooked, dry and apparently the batter \"tasted bad\" (according to my friends). The fish fingers had to be broken apart to eat the fish inside.

I ordered the Roast Dinner. We could smell it before it reached the table. The Yorkshire pudding was completely burnt. I don't mean slightly dark...I mean BURNT. As in, to a crisp. It was black and looked like it had actually been on fire at some point. I asked the waitress to return it to the kitchen. As for the roast - it had a giant lump of hard fat in the centre of it (see photos). I ate what I could of my sad roast, 3 meager pieces of vegetables and flavourless potatoes. About 15 mins later, they brought me another Yorkshire pudding - also burnt. Didn't eat it.

On the plus side, the manager came out and apologized to me and I was offered a drink or desert as way of an apology, which was a nice gesture. I was shocked that they still had the nerve to include the full cost of my dinner ($24) on the bill, however. 

OVERALL
They do have free ping pong and foosball in the basement, which was nice, but didn't make up for the terrible food and poor service. Even the free games won't lure me back."}
{"text":"Went in on Wednesday for a buck a shuck... they said they were out of oysters. Then said they had 20 they could deliver to the table... of 8 people. The oysters came sitting in a pool of water, which were returned. We were sat infront of the bar and was not served our drinks for the first 20 minutes of sitting down. Our server, then bartender left us hanging long enough that I had to get another server to bring our drinks. 

We then got moved to another section to be better served. The cobb salad had over cooked chicken and the smallest portion of salad for 16 bucks. The deviled eggs was more mayo then egg yolk and the orders were mishandled and goofed up. I finished my meal before someone at our table got served her entree. All in all the best comments we got from our group was mediocre food wise. 

When I confronted the management, I was questioned about our table having a lot of substitutions. Regardless, management should never come back at the customer. The service was terrible, until we got our server when we moved, she was fantastic. To were not enough people in there for these types of problems to occur. 

I will never return to this venu and only hope they get there shit together for the weekday clientele."}
{"text":"Kinda wandered in here...food was kinda forgettable compared to their coconut cream pie. I typically don't eat dessert nor this particular type of pie but the waiter was super friendly and recommended this. So I thought why thr hell not... OMG...it was incredible!!! It was absolutely the best! I'm giving this restaurant a 4 just for that pie."}
{"text":"Great experience .  The waiter was knowledgeable and helped my friend (who doesn't usually like beer) select one to suit her taste.   I had the lamb burger it was excellent nice spice level very juicy   In general very good service .  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We made a reservation, and arrived on time (if not a bit early). Right when we were seated, the first thing the server said was that our table was reserved by someone else in two hours. I think on a Friday night we assumed that was likely the case, but it's not exactly welcoming to be greeted that way.
After ordering (pretty quickly), my friend was finishing her drink & they tried to take it away. They asked my other friend (who was the only one who had their plate left) if she was finished not once or twice, but FOUR times before she finally let them take it. 
Then, with 30 minutes left of what we were told was our allotted time, we were told that they were getting \"nervous\" that we were still there. We quickly paid and left. 
I've been advised of time limits before at the time of making a reservation & find that very reasonable. I also find it reasonable to advise people of the next reservation if people are late for theirs or are ordering more drinks or coffee & dessert (none of which we did). What happened here was not reasonable.
If my table isn't ready when I show up for a reservation and I have to wait five or even ten minutes, I've never thought twice about it. In fact, that happens quite often. Wouldn't that be better then making your customers feel like an inconvenience? I guess not at Batch.
For what it's worth, the food was good (a little too heavy on the salt for me, but that's a personal preference) and the restaurant has a nice look to it. It's also very loud (when busy anyways)."}
{"text":"I've been to Batch twice. The first time, I had the burger, which was fantastic, and a few of the beers, which are decent but nothing special. The second time, I had cider and decided to try the charcuterie board. It was a letdown. It cost 20 dollars and came with 4 slices of prosciutto, an egg, and a handful of pickled vegetables. 

On a side note, the menu on the front window is different from the one on the website, which in turn is different from the one inside. Finally, there was a promotion going on but it was not honoured as advertised on the front window."}
{"text":"Was here for dinner with a group of friends. My friend and I ordered the gnocchi and perogies and for $18 the portions are rather quite minuscule. I counted 6 perogies in total on my plate. 

My friends who ordered the Reuben sandwich had a decent portion size thought the salad looked rather quite lacklustre.. So go with the fries. 

We also ordered the wings.. A little too vinegary for my taste and not crispy enough . 

The beer was good, our server was attentive . 

Would maybe come back again though not any time soon ."}
{"text":"Never go here again! I was greeted and I sat at the bar and 30 minutes no one greeted me or ask for my drink order. Poor customer service! My first time in the area and I won't return to this bar. Very rude and sad to see everyone in the bar being service and no one address me(only black couple in the bar). So I left feeling like wow!!."}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious and was very disappointed. The service was slow, to be fair our waitress was very nice, but they seemed to be understaffed.

For a starter we got the beer and cheddar soup which is usually very rich and flavourful. When we got the soup there was barely one scoop full of soup in the bowl. It was so bland it tasted like we were eating hot water with a hint of flavour. They added a fried ball of sauerkraut and some sort of shredded meat which did not compliment the soup at all. For the main I got the brisket. Now, I don't like a lot of salt on my meals but the brisket could have used a handful. The piece was so thin, I'd say thinner than a piece of toast. The best part about this dish was the cabbage and fresh apple on top. 

The sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream was amazing (5/5) and that is the only reason this review got a second star. The fried donut was hard to chew and almost stale. 

Besides the sticky toffee everything else was just bland. Totally lacking in flavour and needed lots of salt. Keep in mind I haven't eaten here in a regular day: I don't know if they just didn't care about the Winterlicious menu and wanted to cheap out but regardless I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Nice find in Toronto. It was a Tuesday evening, so it wasn't packed but had a typical after-work type crowd. Enjoyed a few beers, I'll suggest the Witbier. The Cream Ale is also a solid choice and the IPA had a good solid taste but not much hops. The honey wings were pretty good but may be a bit steep on price. Maybe hit up the wing night on Mondays instead. Good service at the bar made it a win."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. I got a flight of 4 beers to sample. You can pick from a list of 6 of their in-house brews and the 4 Creemores that are on tap. They were delicious. I recommend the IPA. 

Then we got the charcuterie board for app. See the pic. Very nicely done. For mains, I got the fried chicken and my boyfriend got the braised brisket. I LOVE the fried chicken. The skin was nicely crusted and very well seasoned. And the sauce goes very well with it. I think it's the best fried chicken in the city. My boyfriend enjoyed the brisket a lot too. Very tender and almost melts in the mouth. 

Great new place for an after work drink or dinner!!"}
{"text":"I have come here a few times and the beer is affordable, delicious, and with lots of home made selection. The food is a bit pricey for my liking, but all the items I have tried have been good. I suggest coming here for a few beers."}
{"text":"Cheeseboard should have been called \"pickled vegetable board\" as it lacked cheese, $20 for 3 options that were so small two people would have to cut it in half just to have a small bite...coupled with oversized bread. Buck a shuck oysters were...well...you got what you paid for. 

Nice ambience and decor. Not keen on the thought of coming back, tho."}
{"text":"We have visited here a few times, always good services, delicious meals, interesting food combinations. My husband likes their whitbier beer, while my friend likes their porter beer. I high recommend this place. :)"}
{"text":"Came to Batch for a pre-concert dinner- a great spot if you're going to Massey Hall for a night out. We were six people and late in the week, were able to made a reservation for a Friday Night fairly easily. 

I had the fried chicken with brussel sprouts. I am a bit obsessed with fried chicken and found this skin to be nice and crispy, but the chicken itself was on the drier side. Wings ordered for the table proved to be a better choice- breaded, fried but less cooked through and slathered in hot sauce. I think we all found ourselves quite jealous of the friend that ordered the fish and chips. The huge piece of haddock had the most inviting batter of all, and the thick-cut fries were perfectly crispy on the outside with seemingly mashed potato insides. Not finished! His meal also came with two dipping sauces. Lucky duck. 

Our waiter was a sweetheart, but things worked against him a little bit. They were sold out of  three of their specialty beers. We order grilled lemon was ordered as an extra but that had to be reminded- not a big deal- and it was quickly brought out. Someone in the group ordered a last pint, but it never did come and it didn't make the bill. We would have needed to order and pay for another one separately, and wanting to get to the show on time it wasn't really possible for us to wait longer. Less beer for us, less $$$ on the bill - not desirable for either sides! 

Alas, we returned after the concert for a couple rounds of drinks and oysters. A very fun time and I'd return again to give it all another shot. Weird nights happen! Still is a beautiful space and had many wins as well."}
{"text":"I've been there 5 or 6 times for brunch and the food is incredibly inconsistent, very hit and miss. It's quite average but just a bit more expensive than other places in the same category. Nothing too special. So the food is a 3 star but the added star comes from atmosphere, a big sunny open space that isn't overly crowded for brunch is nice."}
{"text":"Came for Winterlicious. Don't totally remember what we had to be honest, but do remember seeing all these other plates go by thinking, \"ooh that looks good and that looks good and so does that. Oh and that too.\" So ya, if oohs and ahs mean anything to you, come here."}
{"text":"Great place! I love the decor--the inside is so cute. The downstairs is cool too, but didn't get a chance to hang out there. We had a reservation, but arrived early. No problem--they sat us. We started with a flight and I enjoyed all the beers. For our meal we decided to split apps, so we got the scotch olives, grilled short ribs, and the charcuterie. Everything was so great, but I especially enjoyed the charcuterie! 

Lastly, we don't usually get dessert, but it looked too good to pass up. The coconut pineapple cream pie was out of this world! Save room!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Service was rude and slow the entire night. Please do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs. A mandatory 18% tip was added to our tab for some of the worst service I've had in my life."}
{"text":"I told the waitress that the lamb burger was even better than the last time I had it. Apparently there's a new chef. Amazing environment and I like that it's a little bit outside of the normal after work crowd."}
{"text":"Batch...more like B*tch. Ashley our server was very rude and unprofessional. Ruined our experience which is too bad because the place looks nice and had potential to be a great place but has terrible people working in it."}
{"text":"Loved the decor and helpful servers.  Unfortunately they mixed up the order so we had to wait another 10-15 minutes for my dinner.  I ordered the trout which was very good.  Would definitely try it again.  Would have been 4 stars if mistake wasn't made."}
{"text":"Our second visit was not great. The oysters that day were not fresh. The server was very nice and took it off our bill.

On, our third visit on a Wednesday, we were told the place was booked up. It gets really busy so I strongly suggest calling ahead.

We've since found a much better place for $1 oysters nearby, so we probably won't be coming back here for oysters."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch with wife & toddler.  To us, it was great because we could tell that it was quiet because Sunday brunch is not their busy time and we had the whole room to ourselves.  We could listen to music in the background, let our boy run around, hear each other converse, and... they had a Jenga set (among other games) for us to play with.  Our server even let me have a small taster beer which was nice.  All very enjoyable.

Food was also good.  The pancakes had a taste to them that was nicer than others.  We also had the Hash and the Croque Madam (winner), and we enjoyed it all.  Server was nice.

Would definitely come back for a brunch based on this experience, and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"A beautiful Saturday lead to a long walk, with a stopover at Batch for some drinks and snacks (what may be a full meal to some is a snack to others). 

Upon first glance - the place is nice - bright, open, big and has this cool minty green thing going on around the bar. I liked it! Also everyone here is really friendly - from the host to the manager to the servers. We were promptly seated and my partner ordered a beer and I decided to go for a rose (I hate not ordering beer at a beer place but I had a craving!). We were told that all food was currently 50% off - huzzah! 

Brisket flatbread -  really good but it was slightly cold. If it was hot it would have been a lot better. But I would come back for this! 

Perogies -  hot and delicious! Lots of carmelized onions and sourcream. Really good

Sticky toffee pudding - I think it had little bits of honeycomb in it which added this great crunch to the dish. Served with ice cream that wasn't sickly sweet which is a great balance to the cake.

Overall - I really like it here. I do think that the food is slightly expensive for what it is. I may not come back for dinner but its a good spot for a drink and a snack. I hope people venture slightly east of Yonge and give this place some business!"}
{"text":"food and beer is Ok. Wait time is a bit long during lunch time and quite limited choices on lunch menu. Last but not the least, they get the smallest burger I ever seen for $15 dollars"}
{"text":"Here for a birthday party of 20+ guests. Food was pretty good but portions were small and it was expensive. It's \"that kind of restaurant\". We reserved the downstairs room. Party of 12 or more and you must choose and stick to the prix fixe menu - no deviations allowed. 

We ordered at 730pm but the entree arrived at 9pm. The staff were pretty friendly, nothing to complain about. 

$45 prix fixe:
- deep fried pickles were everything I wanted from deep fried pickles. Portion was as big as my entree. 
- trout (sans bacon) was... Small. It was alright but nothing stood out. Creamed kale was also alright and so was the squash puree. 
- donut size is small as well but it was dense and I appreciated the dehydrated raspberries. Tried my friend's coconut cream pie and I should have opted for that. 
+ $6.75 seasonal plum beer was delicious! It comes in a smaller glass and they don't fill it up all the way but I can't argue about the taste. 

I'd come back for a drink and an appetizer but not for a meal."}
{"text":"Amazing local brewery with a nice atmosphere for talking and relaxing. Cozy, yet open, contemporary, hip.

We tried the Pale Ale 7, IPA, and Cream Ale. All were crisp and fresh with the right hints of their respective notes. Would come back for a night on the town!"}
{"text":"Checked out Batch for the first time last night. 

Upon entering we were greeted at the front door and shown to our seats. We opted out of sitting at the bar and were put off to the side in a quieter more cafe looking area where coffee and various pastries are available for grab and go at the counter.

The ambiance of this place is fantastic. It is reminiscent of the Amsterdam brew house with a little bit of a Terroni flair. It was fairly busy but not uncomfortably so and the crowd was young, trendy and well dressed.

We shared a couple appetizers and drank more than a couple vodka sodas. The pretzel was great and the mustard that came with it was available for purchase by the door, along with various other condiments. The deep fried pickles were also very good and not the same ones you see everywhere else.

Our service was fast, friendly and attentive. Our waitress Jackie was great and knew the menu inside and out. Despite how busy it was she was never far away and made sure we always had full drinks and waters. Although the food and ambiance of the place is top notch we all agreed that the friendly warm service is what really brought this experience to the next level.

After the food and multiple vodkas we headed downstairs and played ping pong. There was only one table but we made the most of it and it turned out to be a great way for us to meet the people who were down there playing and watching with us. 

On my way out the door I had a chance to speak with two of the managers who were both friendly, dressed professionally, spoke well and were keeping a watchful eye making sure everybody who was working was on top of their game. I had a pretty good idea already but speaking with these guys really gave me the impression that this place is owned and operated by true professionals.

I cannot wait to go back to Batch and look forward to making it a regular spot. A welcome addition to my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I went to a Batch with a group of about 10 people for my friend's birthday. We were looking for a place in relatively close proximity to the financial district since we were staying near by. Batch looked like a place that fit that criteria as well as didn't have crazy high prices for their offerings. 

We were seated immediately (made a reservation!) and were greeted warmly by the server. I really liked the decor in Batch, if I could describe it, I'd say it was upscale casual with a sporty and comfortable vibe to it. 

I ordered the ricotta gnocchi and a bunch of others from the table ordered the fried chicken burger. I wish there were more vegetarian options or possibilities for modifications. I asked the server to suggest some vegetarian alternatives and all she said was most of the salads are vegetarian and some apps as well as one main. That basically only left me with a choice of salad versus gnocchi. I chose gnocchi. I'm guessing we were a bit early for dinner (6pm reservation) because the restaurant wasn't too busy and the food came to the table pretty quickly. 

The gnocchi was great! It came with a butternut squash sauce that was sweet and creamy and delicious. There was also a small salad on top that added some nice freshness to the overall heavy dish. My only issue is the portion size was pretty small. For the price I paid, I was hoping to get a few more gnocchi. I was mostly satisfied when I finished my food but a few more wouldn't have hurt. I also know others at the table felt the same way, the portions were smaller than they expected and they could've gone for a bit more food. I'm assuming this is expected for a restaurant at a location such as this one. We were checking the menu for desserts but it doesn't seem like Batch does desserts.

Tip: Try the fries! They're bigger than normal fries and fluffy on the inside, so good!

Not sure if I would return to Batch, considering the prices and portions, I  I can find similar food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really liked it here! They have awesome beer selection which  they personally brew. Great options for munchies to pair with the beers. Side note all servers here are beautiful people and very conversational. Love how they have a ping pong table downstairs too. It was pretty quiet when we were there but it was only 6/7ish at the time.Overall lovely night."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend for a drink. This joint was taken over by Sherman's after a whole bunch of brewpubs have tried and failed in this building. Sadly I wasn't super impressed with the beer, the service or the crowd. For the Friday of the long weekend the place was dead, and everyone was drinking mixed drinks... not the house brewed beer... bad sign."}
{"text":"Im a sucker for clean lines and organized things. Love the look and feel of BATCH. From the bright exterior decor to the organized interior. This  concept restaurant is orginal and modern. I had the BATCH burger with fries and a Paddington which is a  grapefruit based cocktail. The burger was juicy and moist with delicious thick fries, hated the homemade ketchup the consistency reminded me of tomato soup.  My cocktail was ok wasn't the greatest. Next time I will stick to beer . The desert menu was blah no chocolate anything and very limited after a great meal like that you definitely need to follow it up with awesome desert. I was so disappointed. 
I will try it again in a few months who knows maybe the secondtime will be the charm."}
{"text":"Love this place! 

A few highlights: 
- Excellent witbier! Refreshing, blonde beer that's light and will be perfect for summer. 
- Mac and cheese was rich and decadent. Great for sharing. 
- In terms of service we were greeted and seated promptly. Servers/bartenders were very friendly. The hostess actually followed up with this after we sat at the bar to see if we preferred a table as one had just become available. 
- There's a ping pong table downstairs. Yup. A ping pong table. 

I wasn't a big fan of their house hot sauce wings (it's sweet and smoky, but not hot) but I won't hold it against them because I fell in love with the witbier. They've also got a flight so you can try all the selections. I haven't tried any of the cocktails but I've heard mixed reviews from friends. 

They've got plenty of space for big groups, small groups, or if you just want to chill at the bar."}
{"text":"Visited Batch for the first time during our anniversary trip. Passed by on our way to Eaton Center. Ordered the Blood Orange Belgian Pale Ale and the Dunlin Wit. Both drinks were very good. Appetizer was half off. Got the Rye Pretzel with mustard. Pretzel was very dry, old giving this place 3 stars. Very clean and nice looking place."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS BURGERS.

Don't get me started on how JUICY that beef patty is. The burger practically melts in your mouth and my god the sauce, the sauce is blessed. It tastes like I'm fking in heaven till the sunrise calls me daddy. 

EVEN BETTER: the fresh cut fries. They're bigger than avg but also BETTER than avg. 

Damn. I used to hate burgers but ever since I went to batch I'm somehow searching for more burgers to eat. 

I remember I came back the other day and they said they didn't serve any food from a specific time frame. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, it's cause they're spending quality time on food work in preparation for those beautiful tasty burgers. 

I would recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"The food was good. The restaurant is nice. I got a second beer which was flat. I sent it back and they insisted I ordered and had to pay. I thought that was ubu"}
{"text":"I will give 2.5 to this place. The ambience and server was nice. We were a group of 9 and they didn't charge an automatic gratuity so that was nice. I ordered the lamb burger with feta cheese, charred red onions and red chilli mayo for $17. I ordered fries as the side dish. I do not recommend this meal. The burger was tiny and dry. The fries were cut too thick and too soggy. Maybe ask the server to make the fries extra crispy and that may help. As you can see, my fries are huge compared to my burger when the burger should have been the star of the dish. They really need to re-consider how they make their fries. Probably won't go again, overpriced food."}
{"text":"So the old Beer academy is now called \"Batch\" and on its first week open is real busy.  This basically is another arm of Creemore aka Molson.  So with that in mind it has decent atmosphere and the staff is top noch.  Food looks tasty and the brisket has my name on it for lunch this week.  I personally would have one or two offerings outside of the easy drinkers but hey.  Worth a trip down, Likely will make it into the regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Yes the burger is excellent but I had to wait an hour for the food.  It is a Friday and we were seated at the bar.  Just needed food.  They kept telling us it was coming but of course it did not arrive shortly after they tell us that.  I get it that you have big parties but this is pub food. Burgers and fries.  Get it together.  As well we ordered the oysters and it was not very well shucked.  There were considerably more shell bits than I am used to when going to other places so I know they did not shuck it very well.  And of course after waiting an hour for my delicious burger, we got absolutely nothing to recompense for the long wait.  Seriously? Not an offer of a side of fries or dessert?  It does not help that outside this establishment there is an unfortunate homeless tenement that has popped up so not motivating to really come here overall."}
{"text":"Close the Cinplex, we stopped by here on my quest to try new places in Toronto.

Good spot - especially for downtown which can be known for high prices and mediocre quality.  I think the prices here are pretty reasonable for being right in the core.

Friendly and honest service here as well, which I appreciated.  The server had no problems telling us which menu items she'd avoid.  I went with the regular burger, which was delicious and my friend had a salad which was good as well.

Beer is brewed in-house - I tried two and they were great.

A good find downtown - I'd come back here again to try something new, or some of their appetizers that are good for sharing as well."}
{"text":"Let me start this out by saying that I'm not super entitled or even have really picky taste. However, since both my husband and I worked for many years in the service industry, we really do expect a certain level of service, especially from a new business.

We are big craft beer drinkers and are blessed to have some cool neighbourhood spots with amazing beer near by (C'est What, Beer Bistro). Even though creemore isn't really a favourite of ours or something we would normally drink, when we were told Batch was open we were slightly intrigued. We were even more intrigued to check it out when my friend who lives around the corner told me they were offering 50% off all food until the 16th (something that was confirmed by other yelpers too- they were told food was 50%). We may not have checked it out otherwise (given the other neighbourhood spots that we already know are amazing), but who can say no to 50% off? And, we love supporting businesses in our hood so figured we had nothing to lose. 

When we first arrived the hostess was very pleasant and told us it would be a 15 minute wait. We decided to sit at the bar and grab a beer while we waited. When we sat down, there was a bartender in front of us who was clearly busy but didn't even look up and acknowledge us and at least say hi. After about 5 minutes, another service dropped menus down in front of us and only then did the bartender acknowledge our presence. Like I said, she was busy and I could see that, I wasn't expecting her to drop everything and serve us but a hi or a smile would have been nice. 

We were seated not too long after and our server was attentive and nice. I asked about the 50% promotion and he said \"oh it was only if you had a code\". I thought \"oh okay\" and then texted by friend, who had been there twice to ask her if she had to use a code. She said \"no not at all. It was just something they were doing for opening, and why I went back again, they said until the 16th.\" I was a bit annoyed about this and my husband went to go ask the hostess. We weren't banking on free food or demanding it or anything but were just confused, and it was the reason we were enticed to try the place out. The hostess said \"It was 50% off the first week and then if you came in that week we emailed a code for another 50% off to use the next time.\" It made a little more sense, but my friend confirmed she didn't get an email, she simply came twice and it was 50% off both times, no coupons or codes, her last visit being just two days ago. We were just kind of confused and put off, especially because other yelpers were saying that they automatically got 50% off as well. 

We ordered the fried pickles which were okay but nothing to write home about. Very small, and with a tiny amount of dip (a teaspoon or so), not at all worth 8 dollars (I know what pickles cost). My husband ordered the batch burger and when it came out it was rare (still mooing rare) and cold inside. When he told them they quickly took it away and made a new one. Once actually cooked he said it was good, but he's definitely had much better at that price point. I had the bratwurst with smashed potatoes, again it was okay, but a bit dry and not worth the price (especially when there are places like WVRST where you can get an unreal sausage and fries for about 12 bucks....this didn't even come close to being as good as anything I've had there, WVRST also has way better beer). At this point I was just disappointed in everything that had happened so far, I was over paying full price but generally just unimpressed. It would have been nice if they had offered us even a discount because of the burger incident. Again, not because I was looking for free food but since we have both worked in the industry and have bent over backwards to please customers and build a following, we expected more in terms of service.

Upon leaving the Assistant GM asked us how everything was. I said a little disappointed and explained. I think it's crucial for a new restaurant to listen to criticism but he didn't seem to want to hear it and didn't apologize for anything. When I told him about the 50% off situation  he said \"well that wasn't nice of your friend to say that\", insinuating it was her fault and she made it up when all she did was bring business to them. 

If it was a little cheaper overall, we may consider coming back since we live in the neighbourhood and the atmosphere is good. However, given our first negative experience, and the abundance of other amazing options near by, we won't be returning. Save your money and go elsewhere for better food, service and beer."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night, and it was quite empty. Many tables open. There is a bar with ping pong tables downstairs that was completely empty- not even bar service.  Disappointing given its potential, but it is a little out here of entertainment district, so not too surprised.
Our food was pretty good- we ordered lamb burger and wings.  Both very tasty. The wings were a great size- meaty. 
Service was ok at first, and seemed happier when we ordered.
I don't know if I'd say I'd plan to go back, but if I was in the area and peckish... yeah sure"}
{"text":"There were a lot of TVs all around the restaurant which would make for a great place to enjoy game night and food and a cold beer.  There were a lot of after work crowds here too as we settled into dinner.

The Beer & Potato Soup had smoked beef croquette and sauerkraut.  I found this to be a very mediocre but decent tasting soup.  The consistency of the soup was very grainy from the potatoes and the soup was hot and fresh.  The smoked beef croquette was definitely the highlight of the soup; it was a large beef ball fried in bread crumbs.

The Ontario Trout came with cauliflower, grapes, and a caper and raisin purée. This dish was hot and fresh out of the kitchen and I absolutely loved it. I have to say that very few restaurants prepare and cook fish well but Batch definitely nailed it with this Ontario Trout dish. 

The other delicious elements of this dish had to be the raisin purée that was so smooth and slightly seasoned, the tarty cauliflower florets, and the crunchy fried capers.  I didn't care too much for the half-cut grapes in the dish but they were another unique component to the dish.  The portion of this dish was fair.  It wasn't too large or small.  I could have eaten another helping of this trout because it was just so tasty! 

J ordered the Rye Gnocchi as her main which I had the pleasure of trying a bite of.  It contained pumpkin, toasted and puffed grains, with a brown butter vinaigrette.  The Rye Gnocchi was soft yet chewy and burst of moist pumpkin.  It was really good!

The Sticky Toffee Pudding came with vanilla soft serve.  This Sticky Toffee Pudding was hot to the touch and incredibly moist and delicious.  There was toffee sauce on the bottom of the dish and it went so well with the toffee pudding.  This was delicious.  The vanilla soft serve was a great compliment to the dessert too although the soft serve was so much colder than most soft serve ice creams.

I was really impressed with the food here at Batch, especially the beloved Ontario Trout dish.  We didn't try any of their beers on this visit despite them having a prominent in-house brewery and bar.  Maybe I'll try some next time along with some more delicious dishes!"}
{"text":"Overall, very enjoyable experience. I came in around 10pm on a weekday and the staff were great and hospitable. Good selection of craft beers that are brewed on the premise. The styles reflect current trends in craft beer with selections like IPA, Irish red ale, Belgian wit and other for meet your tastes. Food was priced appropriately given the ambiance and location within Toronto. Portion sizes were good, presentation and service were great!

Only gripe was that they were out of a couple varieties of beer when we came. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Clean new place, opened six months ago
Beers look good
Manhattan was made well
Lamb burger is great, but small portion
All buns and meat made in house they tell me
Would go back!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited two hours for appetizers. AGM visited the table and said we should have asked for the course to arrive. We had asked twice already!"}
{"text":"Tremendous.  Bartenders well versed in their libations.  A curated selection of fine spirits plus home brews to boot.  Broad enough selection of menu to suit every tastes.  Staff is friendly and accommodating.  Definitely a night out to enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here Wednesday night around 6pm for their buck-a-shuck with my boyfriend. We started with 2 dozen oysters but were told there was only 1 person shucking tonight so it would take longer - which was fine, but shouldn't there be 2 or 3 on buck a shuck night? The oysters were very small so we ordered another dozen to share, and that came a lot quicker than the first round! After my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips - it was VERY over done. The fries and fish were burnt to the max as if they were forgotten in the fryer. I got the shepherd's pie (also came with fries which were over done), which we both enjoyed. 

Overall, the food was pricey and alright, and the service was slow. Wouldn't come back here again. 

Tip: If you do want to come here, make a reservation on OpenTable. I made the reservation for 6:15pm an hour beforehand. When we got there, a couple in front of us couldn't get a regular table because they were all reserved and had to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Traveling from out of town we didn't want to pay ACC rates for parking so we parked away and settled in for brunch here. Outstanding! 
Joshua our server was very friendly and attentive, making good recommendations for food and drink. Smoked salmon plate was scrumptious. Goat cheese stuffed French toast wit strawberries was something you wish someone in your town would copy so you don't have to drive 3 hours across the border to eat again.
The place is a brewery and has it own local brews but I was disappointed they were out of the Witbier. I personally also love variety so I would have loved to seen flights of their beer offered but I didn't see that on the menu. Seating did seem limited too so probably best to make reservations before going.
All in all a place I would definitely recommend and visit again. Scope out parking nearby, eat here and then Über or taxi to theatre, hockey, baseball, or CN Tower."}
{"text":"Came for winterlicious. It's a very spacious restaurant on a quiet street. The decoration was rustic with exposed brick and beams. In the basement there's ping pong table and some old arcade games, which is a bit odd but to each their own lol.

The waitstaff are very great at giving suggestions. They were quick a serve and came by at reasonable pace.  

I love the brisket the best. The meat is very tender with some fatty part. I know some ppl don't like the fat but I love how it enhances the flavour so glad that they didn't try to cut it out.

The homemade pretzel was a bit disappointing for me.  I guess maybe I have a preconceived idea of what pretzel is supposed to taste like and this is more like a bagel texture to me  same thing with the homemade donuts more dense than I am used to.  I do like the donut though but I'd probably give the pretzel a pass next time"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Batch on a Tuesday night and had a great time! We were sat right away and had great service by our friendly waitress. The room was pretty loud, making conversation a bit difficult, but it did add to the energy of the place.

We tried a few local beers and were happy that Batch delivered. The beer was made in house and clearly they have been crafting since 1987. We both ordered the IPA, which had some great citrus notes. 

We shared an arugula salad that was delicious, though we wished the walnuts had been toasted. We also had the \"California Burger\" on special. Every bite was delicious and the fries were some of the best we've ever had. Ever. 

No dessert, but instead played some ping pong on the lower level, which was a lot of fun. Highly recommend that or some fusball!!"}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious dinner on a weekday evening. A nice trendy restaurant in downtown Toronto near the Eaton Centre, they have their own small brewery in the restaurant where they brew their own beer. They also have a ping pong table and some video arcade games downstairs that you can play. For $28, you get a 3 course meal during Winterlicious. Started off with drinks so I ordered a flight of beers for about $15 and this is a popular option for many patrons at this restaurant. For the beers, I ordered the Raspberry ginger saison, mild ale, witbier and the cream ale. My favoruite was the raspberry ginger saison one, it was quite delicious. For the Winterlicious dinner menu, I ordered the House made pretzel with beer mustard aioli, smoked brisket with braised red cabbage, sour cream, crispy shallots and the sticky toffee pudding with vanilla soft serve ice cream. The pretzel was good and was served hot and the aioli tasted good with it. I thoroughly enjoyed the brisket as it was cooked and seasoned well. It was also very juicy and fatty which is the way I like my meat. I'm always a big fan of sticky toffee pudding so I am a bit bias in the review of this one. Simply loved their sticky toffee pudding and it works so well with the vanilla soft serve ice cream. Overall, it was a nice dining experience and enjoyed their own beer. Will definitely come back for more beer flights!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a winterlicious lunch, which is always hit or miss.  

The wait staff took our orders pretty quickly, but the apps took a long time to arrive.  The beer potato soup wasn't seasoned, but that easily fixed.

After the apps were taken away, we waited about 20 minutes, the the waiter came by with spoons for our dessert.

\"But we haven't had our mains...\"

About 20 minutes after that our mains showed up.  The gnocchi was fine, but nothing special.  The sandwiches my friends had looked ok, but we were too annoyed by the wait to really enjoy the food.

The donut took another 15 minutes to arrive.  Tables around us were leaving with doggy bags because things were so slow.

I would not suggest going back during winterlicious, the staff doesn't seem to prepared.  I might give it another try over dinner, when I don't need to get back to work in under 2 hours.  

The waiter kept making jokes about the mentally ill man outside... he thought it was funny, but it just made me uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This restaurant would have been a 3, except for the fact that the beer is delicious and worth the trip just for that.  

Let's start with the questionable:
- The service was rather slow.  The waitress was .... over it?  I don't know.  She was nice but seemed like she didn't give a F.  
- Tables are SO close together.  Had to do what is becoming my signature move (see my other reviews) of sticking my ass in the faces of the people seated next to me as I shimmy between the tables.  Sigh.
- The pretzel was wrong.  It was not a pretzel, it was a bun.  I'm not even referring to the pretzel bun.  The actual \"pretzel with mustard\" app was basically a bagel.  Huge fail.

The good:
- Food was, for the most part, delicious!  Even the aforementioned pretzel was tasty (it just wasn't a pretzel, ok?).
- I had a burger, salad on the side and some fries.  Burger was great, love the house buns.
- Mac and cheese appetizer was really well done.  Very decadent.
- Loved the beer so much, I ended up taking some home.  

It's a good place to visit - food is good, space is lovely, beer is great."}
{"text":"We went here during the 1st few weeks of launching. The place has a fantastic vibe and energy to it. It was awesome to finally be able to have all the Creemore brewery's beers available along with alot more beers from other local breweries. Prices for drinks were very fair and the staff was friendly and attentive. 

We only ordered the Lamb burger and it was really really good! Slightly smaller than typical bar burgers but it packed a big punch in terms of flavor. The lamb was juicy and cooked nicely. The bun and the toppings combined with the lamb made this a very tasty and filling meal. The fries with the burger were unique too. Super chunky, crispy and nicely seasoned fries. I didnt think i'd like the chunkiness of the fries but they turned out really tasty! 

We'd definitely go back to sample more of the beers and food items!"}
{"text":"The manager Nate is an asshole. He talked down to us when we requested to watch the Raptors/Golden State game. It was dismissive and unnecessary."}
{"text":"I like Batch. Kind of puzzled tonight when I arrived at 1136pm and was told they wee closed. Yelp says they are open until 2am? What's the deal?"}
{"text":"Went for a Sunday brunch with a group of 8 since it was the only place that could fit a large group at 11:00 in the morning. The food selection wasn't great and the meals were a bit over priced. 

I got the Batch Burger which was a basic burger with thick cut fries for $17....soo not worth it.

My friends also tried the Pancakes but said there was a creamy cheese like texture in the middle that had a bit of a tangy taste...that they weren't fans of. 

Overall, it got us fed, but don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've dined here twice and it's been good both times.  I love their Cobb salad.  I know it's a salad but it's seriously good.  I've also had their fried chicken sandwich which was delish.  The service is good so no complaints there and they were very accommodating to making last minute changes to a reservation.  Overall I will continue to come back here.  I wasn't 5 star-whelmed but it's definitely a solid experience."}
{"text":"I feel mixed about Batch. We showed up on a Saturday night for drinks only. The ambiance and decor were lovely. It wasn't too full or noisy.  

I tried a beer based cocktail - the IP Addington. I don't love beer and can say I didn't love this. Even the beer lover I was with said it was bitter. When I tried my next cocktail, called a paper plane, it tasted like a shot I had done in my twenties called \"gasoline\" - so, you can imagine how that tasted. Graciously the server took it back and didn't charge me. I stuck with wine the rest of the night. My companions liked the selection of Creemore."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this place deserves better... But it's still going through some growing pains and until that gets ironed out, I have to say that this could've been a lot better.. Especially when all we had were drinks.

It was packed on a Tuesday... Good for them really. We put our name down and found a seat at the bar. the bar service was really unorganized. They all looked rushed, and we kept. Ring asked what we wanted by several staff, but no one really owned up to getting our drinks. I picked this place specifically because there was an IPA on the menu.... And guess what... The only beer not on tap.... Was... The IPA. A complete letdown to start, really... So the red ale was the second choice. It was good... But not the IPA.

I ordered their version of the Old Fashioned, with IPA syrup. As an Asian girl who feels her alcohol through her face (Asian glow), the drink tasted like syrupy water. It was overly sweet and the bourbon seemed non existent.

After our first drinks, the second beer we order was the Kellerbier... Once again... Not available at this time. I thought this was a Creemore Brewpub..it was just checking disappointing to hear your beer of choice is not available... Not just once, but twice.

What was really off pudding was that when two servers passed each other, I heard the following comment - \" you just focus on the girls and I'll focus on the guys\"... While it can be interpreted with no harm, it's definitely not something I want to hear and wish that type of conversation was kept behind closed doors, if you know what I mean.

im willing to come by again for a drink, grab some food, and hope that the kinks will be ironed out the next time around."}
{"text":"Went with friends for Winterlicious at Batch. It is a microbrewery so those who like beer had lots of choices although the menu items had food/beer suggestions that we couldn't act upon because they were often out of the beers in question. 
The Kale walnut salad was excellent. Generous amount with a good dressing. The pork chop was dry and the red cabbage was ... odd. No one who ordered the chop/cabbage Main finished the cabbage. 
For the dessert, I ordered the mousse and it was 3 bitefuls and that was it. A friend had the fish and chips and felt the fish was mostly batter although the chips were excellent.
They have very few gluten-free options."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant's to go and have breakfast. Serving some classic, simple dishes with fresh quality ingredients on your plate. Their smoked bacon and tomatoes are de-li-cious. Batch also brews it's own beer, they have a variety of seasonal delicious flavors. My husband and I always walk by Batch and grab a batch of their home made brew. The food is excellent as well as the service. The architecture and design of the place makes it an easy going spot to start your weekend."}
{"text":"Good place for after work drinks. I like the space - doesn't feel like a pub even though it serves British style pub food and is quite loud. Overall the food is just ok, but worth checking out if you like (Creemore) beer. There's also a ping pong table & foosball downstairs. 

I came on Wednesday for the A Buck A Shuck special (small malpeques) and $5 Pilsner. I liked the Burger - very juicy, ground in house, cooked to medium rare. The fries are thick-cut, chunky style, just like England, not much flavor. Other dishes were not so great - lamb biryani, meat pie, fish and chips. The Sticky Toffee Pudding dessert was good though."}
{"text":"Flights of 4 are available so if you want to try all 6 in-house brews, with a friend, just grab 3.

Ok, now the food.. I saw this big slab of wood with meats and stuff on it go by and apparently it was the charcuterie - looked amazing.

I took a look at their lunch menu and it was similar to the dinner menu but with a few sandwiches.. I'm totally trying the fried chicken sandwich soon.

Ok, back to the beer.. I liked the WitBier mostly so far, and the IPA was REALLY IPA-ey.."}
{"text":"Disappointing is the word that comes to mind. The food was so uninspired and boring. I had the pork schnitzel - the fries, more thick cut chips were good. The schnitzel ($24) was pretty tasteless and dry was just battered in the same batter as the deep fried dolls we had to start ($8). I didn't eat most of it, the little bit of salad that was arugula and a couple of cherry tomatoes had a dressing that tasted like lemon juice and oil, I like that so wasn't mad at it but for a $24 dish I expected more. Dry -- all the food is so dry. The person at the table next to me had the beef short rib and mash, it honestly looks like it would get stuck in your throat from dryness. My friend had the trout, it was ok but the kale was dry and could have done with a bit more cooking as it was so tough. Didn't even bother with dessert after that meal. It was kind of a disaster. The plus side the petite saison beer was really good and my friend's dark and stormy had good flavour. If you go, go for the drinks and don't expect much from the food."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Assistant General Manager stopped by our table to say hi.  Great customer service and I really liked their $5 beer special that night!"}
{"text":"@BatchToronto #YELPTO #BRINGBATCHHOME #BRUNCH #BATCHBREWS

Came here for a date night and was not disappointed. Although I am basing the review just off of a round of drinks, the decor in this place is fabulous and the Sunday brunch menu looks appetizing. I would really like to try. 

Service was a bit of an issue, I feel. It's almost like our server could not handle that we weren't there for food. We got asked if we wanted food every 20-30 minutes till we absolutely felt embarrassed to stay longer. Not cool."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, friendly staff. I would recommend the fried chicken and coconut cream pie for dessert. We almost didn't go because it did not have 4+ ratings but happy with our decision!"}
{"text":"We were a group of approximately 45 people that reserved space in Batch's basement for a birthday party - so, disclaimer, this review is based solely off an experience being served as part of a larger group.

First, parking. There are many cheaper lots in the area - don't fall for the $5.00 per hour street parking located around the restaurant. A block east, you'll find lots with $5.00 to $10.00 flat rates instead.

Second, the service. Our servers did the best they could, but Batch bit off more than they could chew when they took our reservation. Our dinner began at 7:00 PM, but our orders weren't taken until about 8:00 PM. Our appetizers didn't arrive until an hour later, and our mains didn't arrive until another hour thereafter. For a 3-course dinner, we weren't able to leave and pay our bills until 11:00 PM. It was a LONG evening, and felt even longer waiting for our food. As well, despite having promised the birthday celebrant that separate bills could be provided after the meal, Batch suddenly only allowed us to use 2 credit cards per table when paying our bills (between 9 people), so that was another messy process sprung on us at the last minute, and certainly wasn't appreciated.

Third, the food. It was a hit and miss, but we enjoyed certain parts of the menu. The chicken wing appetizers were quite delicious - really enjoyed these, it had a great texture and crispiness despite being covered in sauce. The Batch burger was another favourite, and was tender, juicy and delicious. We weren't a fan of the Batch home fries - way too thick and undercooked.

Overall, not a bad spot with a really nice and chill vibe. It definitely looks like a nice place to grab drinks after work at a reasonable price, the servers are very friendly, and the dishes we enjoyed were certainly a hit. 

However, if I do return, I'd rather come back here as a couple or a smaller group - not sure I'd recommend this place for a larger gathering (too stressful, and our guests weren't happy with waiting several hours to complete their meals)."}
{"text":"I would say Creemore is one of my favorite beers out there, so I was super excited to learn that they were opening their own brewpub.

We showed up around 12:30 on a Sunday and the place was sparsely populated. (I think they had just opened up a few days earlier, so I'm sure this won't last long.)

I've had a hankering for a hamburger for a while, so obviously I went ahead and ordered the BATCH Burger. (Dry aged beef + cheddar + red onion + ranch mayo + fries.) It took a while to arrive to the table but it was definitely worth the wait. The burger was surprisingly tasty; it didn't have any unnecessary filler and had been cooked on the grill, so it boasted a very appealing crust. The toppings were perfect, and the accompanying salad was better than expected. (My dining companion got the fries, which I sampled. They were way too thick and chunky and even a little undercooked in the middle. Hopefully they'll switch to a more traditional french fry.)

And, of course, since it's Creemore I had to sample the beer. I got a flight of four different brews and they were all delicious, especially the Irish Red Ale.

And since we're pigs, we had to try one of their six desserts. On our helpful waitress' recommendation we sampled the Coconut Pineapple Cream Pie, which was definitely above average. It's very different from any coconut cream pie I've ever had, as the custard is much more dense than your typical custard. But it's quite good nevertheless.

All in all I'd call this place a winner. I'll definitely be heading back to sample their dinner wares."}

Hi and welcome to today's episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we're javing today. We are having the bangers and mash oooo just reading the description is making me drool. Let's dive right into the review. 

The dish came with two sausages, mashed potatoes with gravy, with peas and mustard pellets sprinkled on top. The sausages were very delicious, but hey I think all sausages are delicious. The mashed potatoes were quite creamy but it would've been creamier with more butter. I really did not like the mustard pellets though. It has an interesting taste which I was not a fond of but one of my friends liked it.

Can't complain about the service. The waitresses was very good in helping us answer our questions and made sure to check up on us periodically to ask how our meal was and if we needed more water.

In terms of the price, this meal costed $18. It's what you would normally expect at a bar but it's slightly on the pricier side for potatoes and a couple of sausages.

Generally I enjoyed the meal and would be willing to try another item off their menu next time. P.S. there are ping pong and foosball tables downstairs. The ping pong paddles and balls were not good quality so I suggest you thing your own so you can smash your friends because winning is important :P And that concludes today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life."}
{"text":"The stars are primarily for the atmosphere- great decor and cool space to be in. Unfortunately, that's where it ends. We each had a beer and an entree. My boyfriend ordered the trout and I got the gnochhi. The portions were so small..... like very upscale restaurant small.. didn't fit the vibe of the place at all from first glance at the plates. That would have been fine, but the food quality was just, not good at all. The trout was alright, but my boyfriend was still starving after. The gnocchi was very strange.. maybe 5 pieces that were a perogi like texture and tasteless, served on a butternut squash puree with hard under cooked squash chunks. Super underwhelming.. and for 20 bucks?! I was pretty annoyed. I am willing to pay for good food and am not a picker eater at all, but when it seems the restaurant is trying to pull a fast one on me its a deal breaker. We went to milestones after and split an appetizer that was half the price, larger portion and delicious. We won't be back unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place with a excellent selection of beer, good food, and even a ping pong table in the basement!

Lively atmosphere and a fun place for a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch and was not disappointed! The brisket was fantastic and the service was great"}
{"text":"Came here after work to celebrate a new job, and it didn't disappoint. The restaurant is quaint and charming on the inside (despite the outside meh-ness). 

We ordered the arugula and beet salad (this was delicious with fresh beets, and goat cheese, and crushed nuts), the flatbread pizza (super fluffy and topped with yummy meats and cheese), the chicken pot pie (this was a little too salty, with not enough crust), and the shepherds pie (this was delicious and a different take with chunks of meat instead of the usualy ground meat). The fries are double fired and delicious and HOT! The chicken wings were the BEST, they were very lightly coated for a nice crispy skin, not overcooked and came with THE BEST HONEY GARLIC sauce (get them undressed with sauce on the side!)

Service was friendly and food came quick. Drinks were also good! (though they definitely tease you with the \"coming soon\" beverages. Will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Cute decor, mediocre food!

I ordered the curried chicken flat bread and it was OKAY, but not amazing. I would never crave it or feel compelled to come back. I heard the same reactions from everyone at my table. My boss ordered oysters and one of them were milky-off coloured... the staff brought her a new one and apologized so there's that at least. 

Speaking of staff, no one seemed too happy to be there. I was there for a staff holiday lunch so naturally we wanted a group pic. We had to flag down 2 different waiters, one who straight up gave us the worse cut eye I've seen and the other wasn't too pleased either. Would understand if it was busy but it wasn't. Waitstaff are a big part of the restaurant experience, would have been nice to cut the attitude. 

The beers are pretty good, I got the India Pale Ale and I really enjoyed it. I would come back for the beers but not the food."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant a while ago for their roast beef dinner and it was a bit of a let down. The roast beef was really fat, I mean I enjoy a good marbling, but this was a lot of fat and not a lot of meat to eat. The Yorkshire pudding it came with was pretty burnt and it was served with mash and seasonal vegetables instead of their advertised roasted potatoes. We also tried their scotch duck egg and that was pretty good. Service was pleasant from what I could recall."}
{"text":"Cool and a classy place for some drinks and food. Ordered mac & cheese, and smoked tomato flatbread. Best mac and cheese I have had so far!"}
{"text":"went here the first night in Toronto with colleagues. Was late when we got there so getting a table and good service was easy. Staff were excellent and spent a bit of time at out table chatting..
We all tried several different beers including flights.
We were all strivingly hungry after flying all day and so had dinner.
I had the pie, which was really nice - my colleagues had burgers which they both enjoyed also.
The beers were nice and the flights decent sizes.
We had a good night here and because we arrived later in the evening, they closed up about 1.5hrs after we go there (which was fine with us - we needed to head to hotel to get some rest anyway)..
Check it out - Batch - you will enjoy it.."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here with a friend last week before a concert at massey hall. I got a flight of 4 beers and especially enjoyed the witbier and the milk stout. I was disappointed that 3 of the beers were sold out though, was looking forward to trying the winter warmer. 

For dinner I got the cobb salad. It was good, had lots of chicken, although seemed a little pricey at $17.  Unfortunately there weren't a lot of options for my friend who's a vegetarian. There were salads but none of them seemed to have much protein, or looked as though they'd be very filling. Something to be considered for future menu revisions I think! 

Service was decent and meals came out reasonably quickly. Overall a good spot for dinner in this area."}
{"text":"Decidedly mediocre.

Had dinner there a few nights ago (on a Wednesday evening) and the service and food left a lot to be desired. 

There was one waiter working an entire room... Which resulted in very spotty and slow service. Especially as the room was almost full. From taking drink orders (15 mins) to clearing dirty dishes on the table next to ours (30 mins) to bringing ketchup (15 mins) everything took forever. 

On top of that, the food left a lot to be desired. There seemed to be issues with the food across the dining room - from the table next to ours receiving poorly shucked oysters to the other table next to ours receiving undercooked chicken. We ordered the flatbread and a burger - the flatbread came out lukewarm. Given the speed of service we didn't even bother to complain. 

Your money is better spent elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Quite mediocre indeed but there may be hope for BATCH. If you are the hunt for both an enjoyable time and good craft beer then there are many, many other places albeit in other hoods to seek out before visiting BATCH. The menu describes the beer styles in way that conveys that Batch could be YOUR first craft beer bar experience and they are here to make everything ok for you. I mean, this isn't Kelsey's, they should be confident with their customers and their knowledge of beer even if this mega sized bar located in a quite touristy area of the city. But it is still a bit tucked away from Yonge just far enough from the terrible 3 Bros bar and situated near tons of various daytime businesses. It's not a tourist trap but sometimes BATCH will make you think twice about that which is too bad. 

The vibe was dull as ever for a Saturday night and the door girl looked sad. They literally played Tears in Heaven by Eric Clapton - I'm serious. I couldn't believe it either. 

The waitress was fine at least - we were attended to just fine, the place isn't incompetent it just seems to miss opportunity after opportunity. There are games in the basement but again, it had a dungeon vibe but not in a good way. It needed some pepping. The place is clean but it is also too sterile. I also remember that the place took forever to open up so surely there is some great pride witchin the owners somewhere....somewhere. 

They have a bottle shop featuring brews of their own right next to 6's of Creemore. I haven't looked it up but obviously these guys are in cahoots with a bigger brewery and that's fine - just painting a picture for those beer snobs out there. They also sell other people's mustard. Why? Sure, you can look past all the mixed bag grocery merch but they should be invested in their own beers more - it gives off a bad image. Where are the shirts, the swag? The label art is basic and simple but I liked it. 

Tons of TVs though with lots of sports which is great - something other craft beers lack. Coulda used something other than just the 2 games spread across them all. 

It just seems like someone has been sleeping through the business for a few months. I mean, it was dead in there too this night. It's time to wake up - that area of Toronto needs more, good beer bars. This is an easy win. Come on!!! You can do it!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious
Pros: Friendly staff. House brewed beer. Food was good.
Cons: No bad comments. This place is worth another visit"}
{"text":"I was waiting for BATCH to open for what feels like forever. Since I'm often in the area, I've walked by this covered up restaurant for over a year. This is located at what was formerly the Beer Academy. It was recently reopened by Creemore Springs and I was excited to try it today with some friends. 

It opened on Monday this week and both days I walked by it looked super busy for the after work scene. My friends and I decided to grab a beer here to check it out. The restaurant is pretty big. It has quite a bit of seating. I've never been to the beer academy so I'm not sure if it's a similar layout but they have 3 or more sections of seating from what I can see. We were seated at a nice booth and greeted by our friendly server. She made some recommendations on apps since that's all we wanted and talked about the different beers they offered. 

My friends and I decided on the Cream Ale and IPA. Most of us like beer so I'm not going to go into too much detail. You can also get a flight of beer as well if you're undecided. The apps we ordered:

Scotch Olives: pretty damn good. Olives with hot sausage and deep fried served with chipotle mayo.  

Short Ribs: also good, maybe a little bit salty. It tastes like the typical Korean galbi with sweet sauce. 

Brisket Sliders: also good, not amazing but good. Came with some purple cabbage. 

We finished off with their Lemon Meringue Pie which was absolutely delicious and a good way to end the evening. 

I really like this place. It seems like a cool place to book a work party as they have a bar downstairs and ping pong table too or just to catch up with friends. The service was great as well and the seating was nice and comfortable. The only reason why I knocked one star off is that I thought the meal portions were a little small for the regular prices. My friends and I definitely took advantage of the 50% off tonight so I hope the portions increase when their promotion is over as the prices are average but on the higher side for meals."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and apps with a group of about 10 and it was great
Tried one of their cocktails - it was strong and tasty. Most others had beer or wine - really good selection of beers, the open area where you can see the brewing is cool too
Tried some dif apps - flat breads, mussels, fried pickles, pretzels, charcuterie boards
It was all pretty tasty - the fried pickles were a big hit at our table 
Service was good too"}
{"text":"Very mediocre. 

We were so excited when this place opened up in our neighbourhood! It has a chic look and I've always had a great expeience when I've visted the Creemore brewery so I expected the same great staff and atmosphere at Batch. 

Sadly, the beer is very meh and the staff is always rude. 

We've tried 4 different beers from Batch. We were extremely disappointed in each one. They all tasted similar (pale ale, grand cru, red ale, IPA) which is funny since they are all different styles. 

Honestly, they tasted like someones first home brew attempt. 

The staff is always rude when we come in and do one of two things. 

1. Doesn't greet us. Stares at us and then when we want to buy a bottle of beer, they say - Really? That's all you came here for? 

2. Very friendly hello but give us some snarkey response about how weird it is we're just coming into the bottle shop and not actually sitting down and eating there. 

Disappointed. Won't be giving it a 5th shot."}
{"text":"Last night I made a return visit to Batch; I met 5 others there for food and drinks.  I arrived around 7 pm to find the place packed; another person in my group had contacted the venue and found that they were completely booked but they likely could accommodate us.  I met 2 others from my group at the bar and we ordered drinks and food there while others in our party gradually arrived and we waited for a table.  We were led to an available table in their back room on the main floor, where we could watch the baseball game as our table was in front of the screen.  I had 2 of the venue's beers to drink - Irish Red Ale and Porter - and I found both quite good.  Another person in our party ordered flatbread and he offered me a piece which was quite flavourful.  Finally, all 6 of us shared 2 different pies for dessert.  I really enjoyed my 2nd visit to the venue; we had great service and I am pleased they are doing good business.  Hope that continues."}
{"text":"Great joint!  Two friends and I decided to check it out and ordered half the menu. Every pick was amazing.  The beer was good, the food was great and the service knocked it out of the park. A guy named nick was our server; he knew the beer, he knew the menu and his service was great.  Beer: 3/5, food 4/5, service 6/5.  I plan to go back real soon with a new group of friends and I hope nick is still around. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Only been here once. The burger was overcooked to the point of dryness and so charred it tasted more burnt than anything else. The bun was completely black too. For the price they're paying, I expect a properly made medium burger. Beer was alright, nothing spectacular when you have all the microbreweries to compare against in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a group of friends and had a very pleasant experience!

Beer was good as creemore always is, they had a generous selection and for someone who isn't a huge beer drinker i found one i really liked that wasn't too heavy.

I had the fried chicken sandwich, was delicious. Not too heavily fried, and the fries served on the side were yummy. Thicker ones with a lot of flavour. My friends had a selection of other sandwiches, one the lamb and one the brisket, all said they were yummy.

The only downside was a cocktail I ordered took about 30 minutes to arrive. 

Decor is nice and modern. Would be a good location for a function downstairs with the pingpong tables.

Definitely recommend paying Batch a visit!"}
{"text":"Attended a networking and social event here on Wednesday evening.

I think it's great that there are small batch Brewers in the city!!  I only had the Whitbier and it was amazing! Great for summer.

Haven't had the food yet, but I'll probably go back and try it out.

Menu was way too descriptive... Too much to read.

Ambience was nice, I like that they had arcade games in the basement! But with all the professionals in suits it gives a vibe of being pretentious- don't be fooled, staff are friendly and attentive, food smells good, and the place could totally be more chilled out without the ties and oxfords.

I'll be going back and give you an update on the food too."}
{"text":"Disappointed really.
Then again it's their first week.
Don't order the wings... soggy mess
Service was friendly but slow
I guess I'll still give it another try in a month or so, just because the beer selection was nice...."}
{"text":"Closer to 3.5 star, Batch resides in the once-upon a time Duggan's microbrewery. We ended up here on a Friday night at the wish of an out-of-town visitor that had heard good things about the place. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. An impressive house-brewed beer selection and plenty of accommodating menu options. The standouts included the Ontario cheese board, chicken wings, and friend chicken. A cool place to host a large group or just for something a little different."}
{"text":"I came to Batch for a beer. I appreciate that Batch is located conveniently in downtown Toronto, but it has always puzzled me that it hasn't taken off as a microbrew. If I were to guess, it would be because the beers they are selling (in bottles, take out format) are a bit pricey. In terms of sitting down and having a drink, the prices are reasonable and on par with other establishments.

The beer is decent and brewed on the premises. There are always neat seasonal brews around, even though some of them are misses. They have a decent IPA which is always my go-to. For those who are unsure what to drink, the bartenders are pretty generous into giving taster samples so you can be sure what you ordered is something you would enjoy having.

I have never tried having a meal here, I am guessing it would be \"average food that are good with beer\". Not sure if it is in their best interest to be a brewery and a restaurant at the same time TBH.

Overall, I like this place and it would continue to be a place where I would come in for a drink from time to time."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this was the most expensive meal my son and I had in Toronto the first week in July -- we were there late on Sunday, July 3rd, and were among the 10 or so patrons at the end of Pride weekend. We each had a flight of beers -- really, a wonderful way to sample a brewery's stuff -- as well as a cheese sample and gnocchi. Okay, also some dessert, so that plus the beer samples explains the overall cost.

The brews were fabulous. My son and I agreed that the seasonal blood-orange beer was the best of each of our samples, though the witbier was quite good, and Batch had among the best IPA I've had (so this says something about the blood-orange!). The cheeseboard was okay -- I'd have preferred five varieties of cheese and less fruit -- and the gnocchi was quite nice. My son had the Banoffee Split, and I had the coconut pineapple cream cake -- good stuff!

Go for the flight of beers, land well with the food."}
{"text":"This place was just average. If you're in the area, it's a nice place to unwind and have a beer and snacks. Food, what's left of it, is decent and there is a good selection of beer and other drinks. Our whole group enjoyed the drinks - some ordered beer and two of us ordered the paddington cocktail. All of the food was tasty, but the portions were a little on the small size (but not unreasonable). We tried the brisket burger (forgot the name), cider glazed brisket and trout. Server was friendly and timely with refilling our water and grabbing the bill. The biggest disappointment was that several \"popular\" items ran out, like certain drafts and the coconut cream pie. We got there for dinner on Saturday night at 7pm. It's the weekend and prime time, how could you already run out of things? Not a good way to run business."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. It's got fantastic staff, amazing food and great atmosphere. This is a gem. You have to go."}
{"text":"We found 'Batch' by accident after not being able to get a table at 2 other restaurants on a Friday after worrk, and I am very glad we came across this gem. Although they were packed at 6pm on a Friday, the waitress said she could seat us at a table that was on reserve at 8pm. (That worked for us) They have a great beer selection and actually brew several beers at their location. They also have a very good wine list and menu (the flat bread pizzas are very good). Service was cheerful and efficient, prices were actually lower than similar establishments in the neighborhood, and there were ping pong tables downstairs. The atmosphere is very relaxed and friendly, this is a great place to come for a drink or snack after work :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes busy, sometimes not so much. I've been here a couple of times now. They have a nice ping pong table downstairs and games to play at tables such as Jenga. I wouldn't call the service particularly fast but not unreasonably slow, either. It's got a nice selection of beers that aren't outrageously expensive nor what you would call a deal. It's just kinda in the middle, in a lot of ways."}
{"text":"Excellent hospitality. It's my first time having my drink replaced with no charge although I spilled it on my own. Not only the staff cleaned up with nice attitude, they also made me feel better about the mishap.

Decor is really nice here. Clean, trendy, minimal, and a little hipster. A casual but fancy place to hangout. There is also table tennis in the basement.

Plus, good food with craft beer...will come back again."}
{"text":"People are nice.  People being hostess, servers, wait staff... beers and brews OUTSTANDING but when it comes to sit down probably a bit more attentiveness is in order 

We had to wait and ask for our cutlery after food was placed and for dessert we went to grab our own cutlery...when service was available it was wonderful!

The meal we had was a Winterlicious lunch which was fair valued but I think I will stick with their brew/beers.  

I love the decor, touch of tavern meets old school classy boat feel--stunning.  Downstairs is a foosball/table soccer area and clear glass for patrons to view the brewing area 

After work is your FiDi crowd and always seems quite busy but comfortable--unlike your Rosewater cheap drink nights.  Haven't found anything that stands out but perhaps I've only ordered the mediocre items ... I wished their was a patio but otherwise a lovely place."}
{"text":"Review is based on drinks and vibe only - no food was ordered.

Came here after dinner one night for some drinks with friends. 

We were seated to the smaller room off to the side which was really comfy and cozy. We ordered a bunch of flights at $15 each. The selection was pretty decent the the beers pretty good. The porter and plum beer were the best, and we re-ordered those in the next flight.

Service was great and attentive. She offered us her suggestions and was always around when we needed her and joked around with us - the best kind of server. 

I would definitely come back for drinks if I were in the area and wouldn't mind trying out the food next time!"}
{"text":"The food here was okay but the portions were a little small to my liking. The fries weren't as crispy as I'd have liked and they were really large. The battered fish was decent enough, not enough seasoning . The burger is also quite small. The beer is probably the saving grace for this place, they have a nice selection of their own brew so be sure to try a few."}
{"text":"Great wine list.  
As a non beer drinker I'm usually disappointed when friends suggest going to a brewery. 
I will always be in favour of going to Batch. 
Their wine list had a lot of favourite quirky Ontario wines that are usually hard to find in restaurants. 
Very pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Came in with friends, though we had made reservations our table was not ready... which was awesome, otherwise we wouldn't have had the chance to head downstairs to play ping-pong and order off the bar while we waited! Definitely arrive early to take full advantage!  

Our server was attentive, reading the table's vibe well but the flow of dinner service seemed a bit disorganized. The food runners auctioned off the food  (e.g., didn't know who had what so they just yelled it out) and a few of us had to order and then re-order drinks when our bevvies never appeared.  

I want this place to succeed - the decor and menus are thoughtfully curated, and the area was in sore need of a place like Batch. I have no doubt that the kinks will work themselves out - I'll be back again I'm sure soon!"}
{"text":"Only came here for drinks, nice place. Big screen TVs, games are located downstairs."}
{"text":"Went to Batch for brunch on a Sunday at around 11:30am. The place was fairly quiet with just a few occupied tables. Service was attentive and friendly and both the food and drink menu was extensive, which is able to please just about everyone. 

For drinks my boyfriend ordered the Irish Red Ale beer while I settled for a KW Craft Cider. Both were great and refreshing. To go along with our drinks we ordered the Spicy Fried Chicken Sandwich (for me) and the Batch Burger. The burger was cooked to medium and tasted great. I had the spicy fried chicken sandwich and it was everything you could ask for. The chicken was perfectly crispy and the buttermilk buns held the ingredients together. The house hot sauce, however, wasn't spicy to me but the real star is the fried chicken itself. 

Overall, good meal and great drink selection. Would come back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Came for a date night w a close friend for Oyster special. Oysters were so-so... Service was very slow, but the other food and drinks were decent. Would try again."}
