{"text":"In the midst of the GOP Convention it was awesome to find an amazing little dive bar! Cheap drinks, yummy huge sandwiches, good music and the best local patrons. Highly recommend dropping in for a $2.50 shot of fireball!  ;)"}
{"text":"We came here for the sandwiches and were not disappointed. The food was good, reasonably priced.

The service was great too, Jenny is a very energetic and accommodating server/host.

I got the corned beef with mustard and pepper jack cheese and tried the pastrami - the meat is stacked! All sandwiches come with potato chips.

I liked the corned beef - it was moist, flavorful, and had a good texture when you bite into it.

I didn't care too much for the pastrami - I thought it lacked flavor. It does come with lettuce and tomatoes which add crisp and juiciness to the sandwich but I find it didn't gel well with the pastrami.

The rye bread is good, although I thought it didn't hold moisture well - it gets soggy quick. The meat to bread ratio was spot on however, kudos.

They have a large table in the back for bigger parties (we had 8 and fit fine). There seems to be a number or regulars who go here and they're nice, down to earth peeps.

Have a try of this place if you're hungry and in the area but be prepared to wait - they make everything fresh."}
{"text":"This is a little dive bar in the middle of town. I came here for lunch during a business convention at the arena. The walk want to far. I sat at the bar. The place was a bit dark. It seems like this place has been here for years. All I wanted was a nice pastrami sandwich and I sure got one. The sandwich was huge. It seemed to be an almost 3 inch stack of meat between 2 pieces of bread. It came with a side of plain old potato chips from a bag. The sandwich was great. As far as everything else, it just seemed like a really divey bar. The price wasn't to bad either."}
{"text":"Super Corn Beef! Service was fast and friendly, if you like Corn Beef Sandwich's this is the place to go downtown."}
{"text":"$1.35 for a 22oz beer. Sometimes Strohs, sometimes Genesee and this is all day everyday! Beer and menu selection is limited but they do them all well at a right price. Order a corned beef sandwich and have a beer all for less than $10 and the corned beef will be the best you'll get in the area. I see that some reviews cite the clientele as an issue but that
just means they don't get out much in the real world. This is my go to
place in the Public Square area. No credit cards accepted so if you are
on an expense account the hotels in the area are more than happy to hit you for $10 and up for your drinks. Right across the street from the Horseshoe Casino. Great place in a great location."}
{"text":"Great corned beef sandwich. Simple menu of a few sandwich choices. That's because it's a bar but if you just are looking for a great sandwich, this works great. Great juke box too. Right off Public Square."}
{"text":"They have an insanely good tuna sandwich! Be sure to try it out and if your looking for some zest with your sandwich add jalape√±os or banana peppers."}
{"text":"Great dive bar in a great location. 

Super cheap drinks, good jukebox, nice bartenders. This place has a nice vibe to it. Come hungry because the deli sandwiches look delcious! I would definitely go back again.

To another reviewer who made a comment: \"It looks like the public bus just dropped everyone off. Rather ghetto.\" 
Yes, there are black people inside. If you're scared of them, don't go. The city is not right for you. Go to the 'burbs."}
{"text":"Only one beer on tap. Sometimes it's nice not to have to make decisions. $1.35 or $2.00 for a tall -- how can you beat that? The sandwiches aren't as cheap, but they're large and tasty. Really good corned beef, although you'll inexplicably pay more for it (maybe that adds to the appeal).

The place feels cozy and friendly and you know as soon as you walk in off the street that this is a place you want to be. The service can also be a bit laid-back, but just go with it and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere,  friendly staff.  Very comfortable bar with great prices on both beer and food.  Well worth checking out.  They even have the same towel rack in the bathroom as the one you see in its always sunny in Philadelphia."}
{"text":"Legitimately one of the last real bars downtown. I would say this and Little Bar are the only ones left. A great place for a sandwich, a cold and cheap Genesee, and listening to some Johnnie Taylor, Sam Cooke, or Al Green on the jukebox. Always a great mix of characters. Not for those from the burbs that are only comfortable around their own.

Hope it's around for years to come."}
{"text":"I was in town a few weeks ago and did some looking around on Yelp for some good places to get some drinks before a concert at HoB.  I decided on this place after all the good reviews and cheap drinks.

When I walked in with my wife I felt a little out of place like a blast from the past.  On a Saturday kinda early (around 5pm) it was pretty slow and seemed to be filled with regulars.  

Started to pick up after being there an hour.

The drinks delivered, $12 later my wife and I were quite toasty and having a good time.  Didn't try the food but saw a good amount of people ordering.

I'd go back again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"A cozy dive bar, cheap drinks, very good corned beef sandwiches, and close to Quiken Loans arena.  If you are looking for something more upscale this is not your place, but if you a looking for a nice little place to grab a drink at before the game this is it."}
{"text":"did this place change since the last reviews or did I walk into a different place? I was here on business and decided to check this place out on a Wednesday at 7pm.  Um...let's just say, it's not a 'business' establishment. No one was eating and there were a lot of folks just drinking and it looked like the public bus just dropped everyone off. Rather ghetto, if you ask me. The bartender was very nice but the clientele was rather sketch.  Drinks were cheap. I shall not return."}
{"text":"Found this place out of luck! Was in the city exploring for the day and was day dreaming about a pastrami sandwich. This place was exactly what I was craving ! Don't let first impressions steer you away from ordering one of their incredible sandwiches! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"After all the reviews and social media posts I have been seeing about this place I decided to stop here during film festival week. This is definitely a neighborhood bar. The bartenders seemed to know everyone who stopped in and what they were drinking. The bartenders/staff were very friendly and welcomed me as soon as I walked in. 

I love how cheap the drinks are here! I paid $2.50 each for my vodka sodas and $7 for my huge chicken salad sandwich. I think this is a spot that everyone needs to check out at least once and I've heard the corned beef is stellar!"}
{"text":"Like a throw back to an old time bar like my dad would have gone to.  Cheap drafts and great corned beef."}
{"text":"Friendly and quick staff. I've only had drinks here but I hear the corned beef is good.  Cheap prices for downtown"}
{"text":"Creepy little bar.  Dim lighting. Old.  Creepier bathroom.  My group of 6 walked in because of the good reviews on yelp.  The waitress ignored us.  We were the only ones in the place.  Finally we asked if they served lunch and she seemed really annoyed that she had to give us menus.  She warmed up to us after she brought the menus though.  It was super awkward.  She made all the food herself.  The food was good, however I won't be back.  Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Wow this is such a great little dive bar I think it should be featured on Diners Drive-ins & Dives!  I went here because I heard the corned beef sandwich was off the hook and yes it was!  I actually couldn't decide between the corned beef and the pastrami so I ordered both lol.  To my surprise my favorite was the pastrami.  I have never in my life had pastrami this good!  Both sandwiches were delicious melt in your mouth meaty goodness and omg do they pile the meat on high!  All the sandwiches come with a side of chips and a pickle.  Also the drinks here are dirt cheap which is always a plus.  And when I say cheap I mean cheap!  I think draft beers were $2 pitchers were $5 and shots were $2.50. You can easily get your drink on for under $20 here.
I'll definitely be coming back here for more pastrami and cheap drinks :)"}
{"text":"Very down to earth joint, it's not a restaurant it's a bar, great sandwiches and stacked, like my girl. Drinks strong, good and cheap. I visit Cleveland from Atlanta regularly and I always hit this spot up."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time and I AM IN LOVE! 

It's insane that you can get drinks this cheap downtown.. $2.25 for a Jack and coke? $3 for a beer and a shot? Mind you, the beer is Genesee and the shots are not that tasty.. but you can't beat those prices! 

I have heard that the sandwiches are pretty great but since I'm a vegetarian I just ate beforehand. It's good for deli meat type sandwiches so if that's your style, I suggest you try it! My friends enjoyed the food a lot. 

This place is cramped and dark - definitely a dive. It's nothing fancy but the servers were pretty nice. Food and drinks came out really fast! Good music and friendly crowd in general."}
{"text":"If I were to ever leave Cleveland, this would be one of the places I could never re-create. Treated like family from the moment my boyfriend and I walked in.  What do you have on tap?  Genesee Cream Ale for $2 (big, big glass).  Yes, please,  Would you like a shot for $2?  Yes, please.  \"Top shelf\" drinks are like... 3.25?  Would you like the appetizer of chips and hot sauce?  Sure!  Giant meat sandwich for $8 (my bf always gets the ham for $6, I get the pastrami... to die for).  Same server always waits on us and we love the stuffing out of him.  BEST juke box in town.  When James Brown comes on, everyone bobs heads, from the young ones to the bartenders to the old timers who have been going there since the opened in the 70's.  But don't take the place for granted... the servers don't play.  That's why everyone's been gettin' along in there for so many years.  Once saw somebody's grandma act a mess in there, get a warning, and get walked out.  

Seriously, it is a magical place."}
{"text":"Wow, awesome little bar. Great Food (King Corned Beef), cheap large beers (23oz $2.25) what more could you ask for? A definite recommendation."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. The corned beef sandwich was as good as I have ever had. The drinks are cheap and Jen was very friendly. Place is old school so don't expect anything fancy."}
{"text":"While my buddy and I were looking for a place to grab a bloody mary on a Thursday morning we found this place open at 10:00am. I walked in and was completly floored at the atmosphere. Dim light, fine mahogney, bartender in ties, and reserved seats had \"class\" written all over this establishment. Great juke box where they take out all obnoxious rap songs, but all you really need is the seductive hum of the meat slicer. The prices were more than generous with Milwuakees Best as the only beer on tap. My buddy had been searching for a great Cleveland \"dive\" and he walked in and instantly fell in love. The highlight had to be the very football savy female bartender kicking out a bunch of drunk homeless people. It was us and homeless people drinking that morning. This place is amazing. I am on my way back now.  You have to see it to believe it!"}
{"text":"Best hot pastrami sandwich in the city!
 (see attached photo) Thin slices of juicy pastrami heaped on rye bread w/ lettuce, tomato, onion, & condiment of your choice; horseradish of course! Served w/ chips & a pickle. Goes down so nice w/ a 22oz Genny & the great crowd at the OST."}
{"text":"This is a bar, boarder line dive bar. They also serve food. Six sandwiches to order from and REALLY cheap beer. Pastrami and corned beef we good, very simple, sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is what old school downtown bars used to be like! Dark and classic! The bartenders and real and awesome. Menu is short and sweet: sandwiches. All made with care in the small kitxhen up front. Corn beef is where it's at. Draft choice is simple. It's Genessee, short tall or pitcher. $2.25 for a tall. $6.50 for a pitcher. Even the liqour is cheap. Place is great..."}
{"text":"Best Bang for your buck! the sandwiches are to die for, the pricing is reasonable and its close to everything you need downtown! its a great place to enjoy some food before a Cavs or Indians game or even a day date. It can get pretty crowded so i recommend going on an off time, around 3-4 but its worth the wait if there IS a crowd. The corned beef is so moist and meaty and tender all at the same time, their bar selections are pretty much endless and they can cater to vegetarian needs as well. Definitely a MUST visit if you're in cleveland."}
{"text":"Can't tell you anything about the food.  Definitely a dive bar, but that's not a problem for me.  Stopped in at 11:30am and the Lady working there pretty much kick me out when I asked to order.  Really no idea what I did to make her mad.  Yelled at others in there too.  Must not be open for lunch."}
{"text":"Cleveland known for Corn Beef sandwichs it's here not super salty but perfect in every way I was looking for a dive bar with a sense of Americana that spoke of the industrial revolution with grit and flavor.
The drinks were dank, muddyfuddpuckers, kick ass prices that make patrons smile. Kevin, Marcus the Deli Man and  sometimes late Jen, there cooler than a Popsicle."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall where everyone is welcomed with a hearty greeting! The bartenders are entertainers especially hotty Kevin. Love the charm and eclectic tastes he has especially when introducing you to new drinks. Great staff and although I have yet to have the corn beef sandwich I hear it's great. Can't beat the liquor prices either! Let your hair down and come hang out with the Ontario Street gang. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland and someone suggested we go to a deli 1 1/2 miles from here. They closed at 1:00 on Saturday and we missed the deadline. Searched Yelp for the next best Corned Beef sandwich in the area and the reviews for Ontario St Cafe brought us in. Other reviewers were right. Dark, unimpressive  facade and interior. Really just a neighborhood bar. But we hung in and ordered 5 sandwiches to go. 
Warm, tender, lean and tasty corned beef. Rye was good but not crispy crust NY style rye. Mustard and melted Swiss complemented the meat. 8 adults splitting 4 sandwiches and each a self-appointed maven!  Comments around the room were:
Scrumptious; not enough flavor (the contrary one); I ate it (93 yr old); it was good; memorable; and mm-mm-good. 
A really pleasant surprise given the appearance of the place. If you're thirsty and eat in, can't beat the bar prices."}
{"text":"Really cool, old school place right across from the casino. Bar reminds me out of a movie form the 80s... bartenders wear button ups and ties etc. Randomly stopped in and wasn't really sure what to expect... its not your typical crowd, but its a very welcoming place. Our bartender went by \"Old School Willie\" and he was as legit as a bartender can come. Only have one beer on tap and shots are CHEAP. Didn't get food this time, but I will write another review as I will for sure be going back. I found some street parking right around the corner but I went on a Tuesday night. Stop in, you will be surprised."}
{"text":"What to say... it is the best sandwich ever.  Don't watch them make it, I think they use a microwave. ..gasp.  a few sandwich and beer choices.  But damn it is good.  Vegans, avoid."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks and good deli sandwiches! Best prices on drinks around, although you are paying for one ounce only. Kind of a rough crowd at times but that doesn't bother us. Good bartenders that don't take any crap which is good the people they have in there. Definitely a great place to stop before you go to the casino for cheap drinks and to get a buzz before getting ripped off in there!"}
{"text":"Did a quick search for sandwiches in the area and couldn't resist giving this place a shot. O.M.G. The food is spectacular!!!

Don't be taken aback by the rugged exterior...or interior, just take the plunge. Well worth it! 

CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Fantastic home town bar, cheap drinks, and good vibes. If you are a Browns/Cavs/Tribe/Buckeyes fan get you Butt here. Like you're sharing stories with old friends until the $3 Jameson shots and $7 pitchers put you to bed. Highly Recommended and will be back as soon as humanly possible."}
{"text":"Simple place with friendly people. It seems like they have a lot of regulars during the day. Staff is super nice too. Really cheap beers albeit mostly natty/light. Although for the right price, I have no problems drinking it. I suppose the craft beer scene hasn't hit this place yet. The corned beef sandwich is pretty big and satisfying. It is the perfect sandwich to eat on a cold day."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, the prices are great, and the jukebox is OG. It's one of the most authentically Cleveland places left downtown."}
{"text":"Relaxing oldschool atmosphere with all the right beers on tap and a GREAT selection of spirits starts an evening off PERFECTLY!!!!!
Their menu has the standard bar fare but you all know my habits that die hard....
Good hamburger with good fries and a frosty cold beer....
They NAILED it!!!
But try to hit downtown when you don't have to pay for a meter or 20 bucks for lot parking...
There are two things we as humans should never have to pay for...
Sex and parkling...
Just sayin'"}
{"text":"Great bunch of guys. They really know how to take care of their customers. I stop in several times a year when I am visiting Cleveland. They remember your face and make you feel special. Excellent spot for lunch or a late night nosh.  My recommendation: the Chicago pastrami sandwich with a Maker's Mark Manhattan. 
(See my pic.)"}
{"text":"I haven't set foot in this place since 1999 when I last worked downtown. Let me tell you, not a single thing has changed in that time, except for the light bulbs, maybe! It was dark in there so from what I could tell they had 3 Genesee drafts and nothing else. Beer was still the same price as they were in 99. I think my bud was $1.50. Bartenders were very friendly on this visit.

They have the cleanest meat slicer in all of Downtown. I watched the cook clean the slicer over and over and over again, no I wasn't drunk and wandering around their back of the house, the cooks slice the pastrami and corned beef in the front of the establishment. I will have to come here at lunch and try a sandwich.

So if you want a low key bar to hang out on the cheap this place is it. I can only imagine what kind of seedy stuff was planned out or went down here over the decades."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Cleveland. A seriously great place to drink and eat for cheap. Pitchers of beer for $5. Great corned beef too. The place is kinda hidden. If you are facing the Kilt....Ontario is to the left. Big fan of this place and it's great prices. Stop on in and support your local establishments"}
{"text":"For what it is, it's terrific. I don't drink, but I had an outstanding tuna sandwich for just $6.75.

It looks dicey, but the atmosphere is chill, and the servers are great."}
{"text":"This is legitimately one of the better sandwiches I've ever had. Basic, fresh, big, delicious. It's not in the safest part of Cleveland, so be weary if you're not from around here. You'll need to be pretty proactive in asking for a menu, ordering or paying. Don't sit at a table if you're by yourself."}
{"text":"Read the reviews so we walked over for sandwiches and got to the front door. 

it was just a bar. 

walked in - it was a classic locals bar. the staff was classic bar - friendly and warm. the food was spectacular. the ambience was spectacular. cannot say how much I enjoyed it this evening   

Don't make a mistake - GO Here!!!
You will not be disappointed 

PS. It's cash only and that's classic too 
a real 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Old school bar with some great deli sandwiches. They've got metal bars on the door, there's no interior lighting, and there's a cigarette vending machine at the entrance. This is a place that doesn't care what you think, it's gonna do what it wants. The regulars look like they haven't left in 20 years. The king corned beef is truly king, with a generous pound or so of corned beef, topped with swiss, on great rye and a pickle. Worth coming to in the evening as well for the $3.25 shot and a beer. FYI cash only so come prepared."}
{"text":"Total dive bar which is exactly what I love. Very dim lighting, cheap drinks with a limited sandwich menu. Cook definitely doesn't short you on the meat..which some inappropriate comments were made about that with a high five to end the conversation haha 
Super friendly bartender, all around it was a great yelp find!"}
{"text":"Good place. 

Was looking for a good sandwich around downtown and this place had some good reviews so I thought I'd check it out. Reviewers are right in that it's very dark outside and inside and the people seem to be part of a club. Nothing bad about that but it is what it is. 

Got the corned beef sandwich and was kind of surprised it wasn't larger. There was lots of  meat on there but the sandwich itself wasn't as big as I was hoping for. However, it tasted delicious. Very good."}
{"text":"Amazing pastrami! Best I've ever had. You will feel like you found a local secret in this place."}
{"text":"great location to stop in for a meal and a beer before or after a film at the CIFF. Very few of these REAL bars left downtown... no posers or hipsters trying to impress. Get a good drink, a sandwich (corn beef is awesome), from the friendly staff. You'd think it was a set from Mad Men... sit in a booth and enjoy."}
{"text":"Rip-off Alert - 

After three drinks, two ordered as doubles after the first, all five of us left in search of a bar that served alcohol. The Stoli was so watered down, it was impossible to detect in the drink and none of us felt anything either.

The corned beef sandwich was very good, and if you are drinking beer, then this is a safe bet.

Too bad because the servers are friendly and hard-working and it's a nice diverse crowd."}
{"text":"A classic old-man bar. You know, the kind of place it's okay to drink during the day. I had the pastrami sandwich with cheese and horesradish. It was just fantastic.

The service staff was absolutely wondeful. They were very nice and pleasant. Not what I expected. I absolutely love everything about this place and I look forward to going back after work for a few drinks and food. 

The establishment is cash only. Who cares with these type of prices.

Carry on Ontrario!"}
{"text":"What a great bar. Total hole-in-the-wall, the kind of place you probably only end up at if you know someone who knows someone who drinks here. We like it pre-Browns games because it's never as busy as all the other downtown bars, & their beer/shots specials can't be beat. Grab a pastrami sandwich & a Genessee & get rowdy before heading over to the game, where everything's notably more expensive. Ontario Street Cafe's servers are friendly & efficient, the music is on-point, & you're within stumbling distance of the stadium. What more can you ask for?

One star off for being cash-only, but this is the kind of place that can get away with it. And hey, that policy probably keeps them from being so crowded, anyway, so I won't complain."}
{"text":"(Non-local traveller). Like Kevin said to us, cheap booze, good service, and funny jokes.
Happy to get my buzz on without emptying my wallet."}
{"text":"This is more like a neighborhood pub, but it's in the heart of a busy downtown across the street from the casino.  The drinks are very reasonably priced, and I will second the opinions here about the corned beef sandwich.  It may not look like much outside or inside, and the food menu is simple (mostly sandwiches), but the food is well-prepared and delicious."}
{"text":"Every time I slip in here for lunch, I get a bit sad, but that's only because I realize I can't join the handful of professional drinkers at the bar in the midst of my workday. This dimly lit vinyl-clad wonder is hidden in plain sight just off Public Square. If you're getting lunch like I do, the servers are friendly, your sandwich is whipped up to order directly in front of you, and every order comes with potato salad, chips and a fountain drink. Under $7 for a non-mystery meat deli sandwich with all those bonus items works for me. Note that the menu is tiny (six options) and has nothing listed for vegetarians. As a bar, I know of none cheaper downtown. The alcohol prices are listed, and they're absurd. Under $6 for a pitcher of beer. Under $2 for well drinks. No, these are not happy hour specials. Those food and beverage prices draw a decidedly working class crowd, which simply adds to the ambiance in the place. This would be an ideal spot for a low key, low cost happy hour, or succumbing to temptation and taking an afternoon off to enjoy cheap booze and awesome ambiance with my sandwich."}
{"text":"Excellent all around, service, corn beef sandwich, price! The chips weren't anything to brag about but the sandwich totally made up for it."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Corned beef sandwich was probably the best I've ever had. Had a few beers as well at great prices. Staff was awesome. Will be going again the next time I'm in Cleveland. I'd give 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"One of the greatest dive bars I've ever been too.  Cheap AF beer and gigantic corned beef/pastrami sammiches.  Only blocks from the Jake and the Q.  I ate their for lunch by myself but suspect with a couple buddies it could get real interesting."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's stuck in time and that's a great thing. Cold, cheap beer; delicious deli sandwiches; and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Yes Virginia, real dives bars are still downtown. When I heard that Alan Glazen, of XYZ, ABC, OWGKTA, I was cringing that he was going to change the OSC from what it was (as I imagined it). 

Fortunately, one of the last remaining dives of downtown appears to be the same as it was before he bought it. hostesses/bartenders still wear the white dress shirt with tie. 

Nothing updated in the past 10 years - The dark wood tables, the classic green bankers lamps at each table [I love them], dimmer lighting, and prices from the 1990s. $4 Long Islands. The handful of drafts were all the poorer domestics - Genesse, etc. 

I had arrived with my sisters at Thursday, 10:30pm and they still had food cooking. I pastrami on seeded rye, satisfied my hunger, for $6 or 7, a good value, not very fatty either. 

Looking for a dive bar downtown, without paying a downtown premium for liquor ? You've found it."}
{"text":"a discreet awning
a bygone era awaits
with a sandwich man

Cleveland needs more of these.  Cleveland once had more of these. Warm, dark, with a kinda shady vibe.  Class act, old school bartenderesses that are charming, but not to be trifled with. Shot glasses. A sandwich man with the classic paper hat mans the deli slicer in the front window. He makes a helluva sandwich. Quality meats, including pastrami from Sy Ginsberg. 
The awning says \"famous since 1976\".  I'm pretty sure the prices have not changed since then either.  Or the rest of the place.  And that my friends, is a very good thing.

Carry on..."}
{"text":"Hole-in-the-wall bar with some of the friendliest people and most delicious sandwiches we've had in many months. The corned beef and pastrami sandwiches were perfect.  Staff and patrons alike were friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Nice place and cheap drinks! The corned beef sandwich was so great! We arrived at Cleveland on 12am. Fortunately, we found this place to have some great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Cash only but the cheapest drinks anywhere! And the bartenders really make the place awesome."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB. Dive bar in the heart of Cleveland. I'm only upset that I didn't find this at the beginning of my convention. R&B funk and soul here. It's incredible. Such a good vibe. Drafts are $2.25 for Genessee beer apparently a local favorite. The corned beef was great and my bartender was real nice. She obviously loves this crowd and working here. What can I say... Super close to the Renaissance and casino. Stellar find. Go here!"}
{"text":"The family ate at another cafe on the corner. I snuck off to the Ontario, ordered me up a King Corned Beef to go and picked it up on the way to the car. I had the best meal of the day..."}
{"text":"True dive bar....submerge, submerge, submerge! But, admittedly their corned beef sandwich was excellent. The atmosphere belies the food fo sho."}
{"text":"Finally made it in to a Cleveland gem, the Ontario Street Cafe.  I didn't have time to stay and dine in, so I took a roast beef sammy to go.  I ate it at my desk about 15 minutes later.  It was a delicious sandwich.  I had them put it on a kaiser roll with swiss cheese, lettuce, mustard, tomato, and mayo on it.  I loved every bite of it.  Cant' wait to try the other sammiches.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's almost a year later and I am still thinking about The Ontario.

How can an Old School bar within walking distance to the Stadium and next door to the Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery sell a Jake & Coke for $2.25 or $3 for a beer and a shot?

And my Corn Beef Sandwich, SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! A year later and I can't wait for Football to start and go back to The Ontario."}
{"text":"A nice small place to sneak in when you're not in the mood for the crowds at the casino or the barely dressed servers at Tilted Kilt.  

You feel like you're in a different city, or a different era, when you walk in here.  It's warm and cozy and some fantastic drink specials all written outside so you know what you're getting in to.  

It sure is nice here at Ontario Street Cafe."}
{"text":"Oh yeah!  This place is the real deal.  The \"famous corned beef sandwich\" is totally worth the years it will take off your life when you eat it.  Absolutely delicious!  

Be forewarned - the corned beef is more expensive than everything else on the menu.  Other sandwiches are like $6 or $7.  They come with chips and a pickle.  You can also get a nice, big 22 oz Genesee Ale for just $2.  Score!  So for under $10, you get a good meal and a good beer.  What's not to like?  Well, I'll tell you.

It's a dive.  Dark wood, dark paint, dark everything in here.  I LOVE that, but I can see how other people wouldn't like it.  I sat at the bar for lunch and two people came in, looked around and left while I was there.  Their lose!  They had old-school 70's R&B jamming in the background and the Indians game on the TV.  There were several nice old timers bellied up to the bar, too, who obviously knew the young woman behind the bar.

I'm thinking I'll get in here again.  Maybe not on every trip to Cleveland, but definitely a few more times.

CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Best and TRUE dive bar. Cheap and good drinks and great sandwiches until 1:30 am. This is in NO way a touristy place. When you walk in it looks scary and uninviting but I was fine. Sandwiches are bomb get the King corned beef. My Roast beef was okay. Good chips and pickles. The bathroom is tight but I have been in worse. They have the old skool towel machine. Where you actually pull down a cloth to dry your hands AND you place your change in the juke box! Place is like traveling back in time."}
{"text":"Old school downtown bar.  Dark wood, green lampshades.  Reminds me of what the world looked like when I was growing up in the '70s and early '80s. Good R+B jukebox, good corned beef sandwiches (corned beef seems to be really big in Cleveland).  White-run bar with a black clientele.
Downsides?  My buddy was shocked that an old-school bartender would serve a Jack and Coke in a rocks glass. While we drank a lot of great brews in Cleveland (including those we had at Great Lakes Brewery), he complained that he never got a properly mixed drink in the whole town.  Also, I imagine this place may get a little crazier later at night, what with a lot of people going back and forth to the street and a notice, unenforced in the earlier portion of the evening, that the bathrooms were locked and you had to be buzzed in by the bartender."}
{"text":"This is a sleeper of a restaurant and bar which is located downtown Cleveland. 
The specials sign out front on the sidewalk is a good starting point.  The corned beef is their specialty and they knock it outta da park!!

The place is small, dark, and old. The staff is friendly and down home. In the background is oldie Goldie tunes playing from a jukebox that's perfect for the divey ambiance.

Food orders come out quickly. My sandwich was about four inches tall with corned beef stacked upon thin sliced bread!  I though I might dislocate my jaw trying to bite into this monster sandwich since I can't unhinge my jaw like a python!
With my best effort I succeeded in taking my first bite! I was not disappointed! The corned beef was prepared perfectly, it wasn't chewy or tough and the flavor was great!

Served with potato chips, this meal is enough to feed two people, but I went above and beyond and made the chef happy by cleaning my plate!"}
