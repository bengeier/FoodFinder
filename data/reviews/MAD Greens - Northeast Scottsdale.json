{"text":"Salad place is decent is your trying to have a quick healthy lunch . Got the Sam I am salad and I should of asked for no quinoa because I literally hated that part but other than that the dressing and portion was great . Will
Stop in again"}
{"text":"Caesar salad was mostly white romaine lettuce(the kind I buy at the store is green) and the dressing was basically mayonnaise with a hint of garlic..So sad  :("}
{"text":"Love this place!! I don't live in the area, so I'll make a special trip to have delicious salads they offer. It makes eating healthy easy, quick, on the go. The staff is super friendly and will answer any questions you may have or help decide what to get."}
{"text":"I was just in to order a salad and the cashier charged my credit card while lecturing me about credit card policies.  Telling a customer they are inadequate, right after collecting money from them is terrible customer service.  As I walked out the guy laughed at me.  Customer service is not important to this establishment apparently.  The salads are sub par, there are many better options in north Scottsdale for a much better price.  I liked this salad shop because of it's location, but being treated so poorly every time, I am never returning.  If you want a better option, visit grabbagreen or freshbox.  Both have great salads and will treat you like they want your business in the future."}
{"text":"My first time here I would have given it a 3.  The Molly Brown salad was fine, but bland.  Tonight, I'm going to have to knock it down. 

I ordered the Green Detox juice, which I couldn't drink.  It tasted so much like kale, I think they forgot the rest of the ingredients.  I'm a regular at Nekter, so I'm not a juice newbie.  

Worse, though, was the \"soup\".  I've attached a picture of the Organic Split Pea and Kale \"soup\", which was actually lemony flavoured mushy peas with kale bits. I ate a few spoonfuls because I was hungry. If this had actually been soup, this probably would have been good.  As is, you can't call a solid soup, so I'm pretty unhappy about that.

The employees are clearly still learning, but they are friendly, so props for that.  

It's a shame - this place is so close I can walk to it. Id love to be able to eat here, but someone is going to have to do something about the food."}
{"text":"SUPER helpful and friendly staff.  Greek salad was delicious as was the cookie for dessert.  We go back."}
{"text":"I loved this place and the concept! Te only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the price.. I think it's a bit $$$ . I would eat there more often if there were coupons or the prices came down."}
{"text":"Got chicken tortilla soup Togo today. It came with a long hair in it. I was so grossed out and threw away my soup along with my wife's. Totally sucks!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, fresh, clean. I visited the place 4 times in the past two weeks, can't resist coming back. 
I usually make my own salad,choose the ingredients myself. It never fails.   
The curry wrap is AMAZING. 
Staff is super nice. 
Gave it only 4 stars because it's very pricey. a salad and a drink can easily be $13-$14 pp.  If it was cheaper it would be my daily lunch spot."}
{"text":"Fresh! Tasty! Excellent! So good! Can't wait to try another salad! Had the Poncho Villa and my sister had the Athena. Both were delicious! So glad we stopped here today! 1st Time!"}
{"text":"Price. Almost $ 13 salad....piss off. You want more $ use the chipotle model.  You are closed by 8 as I'm getting home, and you charge ass loads"}
{"text":"***This review may change after my next visit***

I say this because the place is new and the staff is new.  

Staff- Very friendly 
Annie Oakley panini was absolutely delicious!! 

The salads were really good too and priced the same as most restaurant salads.

I waited over 40 minutes for my to go order.  The salads were made quick but the paninis were either forgotten or severely delayed.  Someone came over and asked me what I was waiting on. It was busy and the place and staff is new so I understand they are still learning the menu and building team chemistry so I will be back soon to see if it's better.  The staff seemed a tad overwhelmed and there were other orders that got mixed up and/or delayed.

They did apologize, like I said the staff is very friendly!  They gave me 2 coupons, each for a free salad which is an awesome recovery if you ask me . 

I really want to love this place because it's convenient and a healthy option."}
{"text":"Pros: been here only twice but my wrap was so good I drove pretty far to come back. Very clean. Very fresh 

Cons: staff, energy and lack of knowledge. When I told them I was new I got a blank stare from everyone. Even when I asked questions. No welcome, no intro to concept, suggestions of most popular or enthusiasm at all. I winged it trying to figure it out. They didn't even try up sell me with add ons etc"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  Now I know why my husband likes to eat here a few times a week!  I had the Athena salad and it was so delicious with just the perfect amount of each ingredient.  I can't wait to come back and try some of the soups."}
{"text":"Their online ordering glitches and did not register my order, then hours later I get a confirmation email and my credit card was charged. Talked to David the manager at the location and he said corporate had to issue a refund. Julie at accounting contacted me and assured me a refund would be issued back within 2-3 business days. Still nothing 7 business days later. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE! Horrible antiquated system and the corporate office is not helpful and David the manager says it's out of his hands. Just thieves at this point. I will post more negative reviews on other sites to inform others of this horrible experience."}
{"text":"Where to begin... ordered the pasta salad to go. As soon as I got home and began to eat it .. almost every single piece of pasta was hard. When calling to inform the manager, the MOD told me that the pasta is sometimes from the previous days! Yuk! With that being said.. the MOD did offer to take care of my order my next go around. A few weeks later I thought I'd try this place out again... as I was informing the cashier that my order would be taken care of next time due to the issue of my order, she basically didn't believe me. As a line grew behind me.. her exact words were \" I guess we'll do it for you this time\"....."}
{"text":"Loved my salad, \"Bonnie Parker\". It was so delicious!! Had the trio of hummus and it was just as yummy!  I have to admit I was impressed that they had mint iced tea...So happy that they are in the neighborhood, as it's important for me to keep a healthy diet. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went in because I had a free coupon from a friend who loves this place- I had never been so I was asking for suggestions from the salad expert- who didn't really help. I ordered the Siam I am as a salad to go and when I got home they forgot chicken and quinoa- the two main reasons I ordered this salad. I still ate it and it was okay. Probably won't go back"}
{"text":"I knew this was a new place and was hoping to love this healthy venue, but I did not like my first experience at Mad Greens.  Had the large \"Greek\" Salad.  Hardly a greek salad considering that there were just \"crumbs\" of feta cheese which did not have a real feta flavor.  Generous portion of romain lettuce with NO CRUNCH TO IT, some kalamata olives that did not have a nice flavor to them, and some \"citrus\" flavored cubes of chicken.  
Did not like the citrus chicken--not citrusy at all and so small that it was dried out.  Hubby upset that I paid $10 bucks for a large salad of mainly tasteless romaine.  The dressing which had red wine vinegar and what appeared to be whipped dressing that did not taste good.  It was allegedly supposed to have feta cheese, but no such thing. No feta flavor.   I used my own dressing to try to eat it.  Hubby did not eat any of it and encouraged me to just dump it because he was not going to eat it.  
I would suggest that the place rethink as to how they can keep the greens crispy.  At home I usually put my greens in a bath of ice water and they crisp up wonderfully. They have to work on making sure the chicken is moist and if it is a greek salad then you need to have some PIECES of feta cheese.  Since this appears to be a franchise, it is unlikely that they can change their formulas or procedures.   I wish them the best but I have to be honest about this place.  
I will give them 6 months and try them again and hopefully they will have corrected their shortcomings."}
{"text":"I always want to be a fan of healthy places, but this one is meh. Salad was ok except for all the stems on the spinach. It got tedious picking them off. Not sure if some people eat 2 inch spinach stems, but I don't and I found that annoying. I also had a tough time finding a table that had been cleaned. And the place was almost empty. Kind of gross. Not saying I won't be back, but a little underwhelmed right now."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Came to Scottsdale for business, had lunch there 2 days in a row. Wish they had one back home in Texas"}
{"text":"Just got off work and stopped in to grab a quick salad. I wish I got the girls name because she was so personable and sweet. Never been in before so she was really helpful. I will be back. I found my new lunch place since it's right up the street from my job."}
{"text":"I love this place. Good healthy food and many options.  The price is also reasonable.  This particular location is rather new and I hope the manager is reading this because I think more staff training is in order.  Everyone seemed very confused.  The person making my order did not know the ingredients and she apparently forgot to give the very confused cashier my ticket. After finally figuring that out he over charged for my up grade. 

Bottom line I still love this place and will keep coming back regardless"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite salad/wrap/bowl place in Scottsdale! The new grain bowls are  and so satisfying!"}
{"text":"This is the review you get when you let kids run your business. 

I go into the restaurant, told me they had no Mediterranean style salads when I walk in.. then after looking over the menu I see they have a Greek salad. News flash that would count as Mediterranean style salad. 

Then I ask for two balsamic dressings and they give me two creamy southwestern dressings I find out when I get home. Keep in mind I was the only customer... and all they make is salad, this should be the easiest order of all time. 

Pure incompetence behind the counter, will never return or recommend."}
{"text":"I ate a salad here yesterday and noticed a short, dark hair stuck to a piece of chicken. I threw the piece of chicken away and insanely went back today for another salad because I was short on time and this place is close to where I work. As the guy WITH NO BEARD NET made my salad, I realized - there was BEARD HAIR IN MY SALAD yesterday. This is not acceptable. Also, the 2 girls working there have long blonde hair, hanging out of their ponytails all over the place. Yuck. I can never go back. Is this not a health code violation? How nauseating."}
{"text":"I believe MAD Greens is going to be a survivor. 

What do I mean?  Well, there has been several Salad places nearby that didn't survive. They failed, I believe because they were either one trick ponies, or their offerings were just simply unimaginative. MAD Green brought their game face and seems serious about being around for a while. 

First the location is in the Safeway's shopping center, with several other fast options; from pizza to Chinese -- they're a lot to choose from here. Yet, they were busy the night we came in.  It's also across the parking lot from a hot yoga  place. Judging by the foot traffic, there's a great many crossover customers. 

Second, the food is heathy, and it's not. What I mean is, if you want to enjoy a salad, soup or sandwich, with low fat dressing or mayo to keep you calories count in check, you can. If on the other hand, you want to load it up with some, er higher fat extras, done!

We enjoyed the Turkey sandwich (photo) and a Soup and 1/2 sandwich combo, both were good. 

Now, if you like heat as I do, buy one of their pepper spice bottles for $5.99, see photo. You'll thank me later.  M-e-r-c-y, does that have some kick!

MAD Spice aside, expect to pay $11-$12 with an iced tea, or soft drink. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Healthy option for food! I ordered the don Quixote with shrimp and it was very spicy but yummy! The lemonade tasted like it was made with real lemons and sugar!"}
{"text":"The staff were really nice and accommodating and gave me suggestions on the menu when I asked! I've never been to Mad Greens before now, but they 'big' salad was just enough to share and their drinks are fair trade, which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Very tasty. So very much tasty. I went at 4:15 to this locale on a Tuesday and there was no line. Actually I was the only one in there. It was my first time at a mad greens. Everything was clean and the employees very friendly and helpful. I love the ability of being able to tweak one of their menu items. I also loved all of the dressing items. It was so good! Not necessarily cheap but i am ok with it. I feel very satisfied. I'll definitely visit a mad greens locale again."}
{"text":"Good salad, I always build my own and it's always delicious ( been going there every single day for breakfast this week)."}
{"text":"I like e everything about mad greens... It's quick, healthy, fresh, they use a lot of local produce and its kid friendly. I have gone here a few times and never been disappointed. And you can't beat their kids boxes, which you can build your own for whatever your little likes, deff a great alternative to fast food. Hope they continue to open more locations around the valley. Thank you for the excellent customer service and healthy food option for my family!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 or 4 times now and generally in the evening.. They are very clean & organized. Food ingredients look extra fresh & crispy during the times I've been here. 

Staff is very patient with explaining all the menu options as they can appear complex and overwhelming. It's a positive place to eat and order food and they make salads interesting and while still being tasteful.  Good salads & good food."}
{"text":"Visited this location for the first time last week. Was excited because I have had the food a few times and was super impressed with how tasty and fresh everything was. The service here was pretty horrible. We ordered first, but somehow they people behind us had their order made and finished first. I ordered a salad and my husband orders a panini, but they ended up making him a salad instead. I didn't say anything right away because I had never been inside and I wasn't sure the process of how they combined the ingredients, but at the end when I said that it was wrong the guy helping us was so annoyed. I will say that the manager working did not charge us for it, which I greatly appreciate.

So let me talk about the bad service mentioned above. While making our food the employee told us he was tired of making salads. Excuse me if I'm wrong, but you are primarily a salad establishment. You could clearly tell that he did not want to be working there. My salad had avocado, which he seemed irritated to have to get and then didn't even break it apart. I had a whole half of avocado that I had to break apart when eating, which was disappointing as it wasn't mixed in. We didn't have them remake our wrong meal, we just had them give us a tortilla to have with it; however, the employee did not wear gloves when handling it. That is a ready to eat food and should not be touched with bare hands. I feel like the employees should have also been wearing gloves even when making the salads, but I guess since they were using tongs they might not have to. Hopefully they will take care of that issue because that can become a food safety issue.

I still enjoyed my salad, but it is highly likely that I will not return to this location even though it is walking distance."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their salads here! I have been here over a handful of times, and love everything I have tried! So many yummy ingredients to choose from and all salads are fully customizable, which I love. The dressings are unique and delicious (LOVE the fat free honey mustard; it tastes different than any honey mustard dressing I've had, and is sooo good!)! My husband even loves coming with me now, since they added the grain bowls! Hooray (he's not much for salads)! Now the whole family can eat healthy-- either on-the-go, or sit-in. Only complaint is they are expensive for an \"at the counter\" place, which is a bummer. We would go more often if they were less expensive!"}
{"text":"Updating my review because the hummus, soup, and customer service keeps me coming a minimum of once a week"}
{"text":"Use to be a great place to get a salad little pricey but it was good. Now it has gone down hill and getting worse. The management is terrible from what it was. I got sick on the chicken that was not cook all the way. The people don't care they just throw it together all for $12.00. I can go across the street build my own for $7.00 and it's much much better.
Never again will I go in there."}
{"text":"Excellent service!! Great place for healthy salads. McKayla was super friendly and helpful! The salted caramel cookie was amazing. I can always count on mad greens for a healthy lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Always fresh healthy delicious food, get a fresh juice and Annie Oakley every time and my gf makes her own salad. Huge selection and everything is always highest quality. Great service every time but Eric and Melanie went above and to make sure everything was perfect. We wanted to try some of the dressings we hadn't had before and Eric gave his suggestions and patiently let us try to find our new favorites siracha almond and red pepper dressings that go amazing with the panini! Amazing service and amazing food makes us come back every time!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this new place, because it allows me an option for eating healthy other than my usual spots. It's sort of like a salad bar on steroids, and an assembly line vibe similar to Chipotle's or Subway's approach. I just do the \"build your own\" and walk along and point to stuff I know I like and is healthy (e.g. beets, artichokes, avocados, pumpkin seeds). How often do you prep a salad at home with such varied ingredients? That right there is enough for me to go regularly. It's like $15 after a drink and my special add ons, but how much is your health worth? I am recently very fired up about eating right after reading the book \"Always Hungry?\" by Ludwig (amazing book, changed my life) which shows the science behind why it is so bad to eat processed carbs and sugar. When you cut those out of your diet, it's hard to find yummy fresh food but this place does it for me."}
{"text":"Wow so good! The salads and pasta are so fresh! The staff is really friendly as well, and knowledgeable about all the food they offer :) the store was super clean too! I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place ALWAYS knocks it out of the park. I had been going to similar concepts nearby, and there is a ton of them in North Scottsdale, but one thing that stands out for me about this particular location is the genuine interest in customer satisfaction. There is a slightly older gentleman that is often here when I go, not sure if he is the owner, or manager...but he always tells me about new things. Asks if I have liked the things I ordered. Makes suggestions. Even comes over after ordering to make sure you enjoy what you got. The REALLY surprising thing for me though? When he is NOT there, and his staff does the same thing, even without the watchful eye of a manager. Maybe it's the years and years I spent in retail management, but when i see an off duty employee straighten chairs and take some stray napkins to a trash can on her way out of the store...off the clock, then thanks someone for coming in as she exits, those little details show pride in the store, and respect for their customers. I only wish the word could get out more about this place because it's never busy, and I don't want it to close. Thanks for doing an A+ job, everyone."}
{"text":"I order the Poe salad, which is composed of spring mix, apples, pears, blue cheese, chicken, and nuts. I added red onions also. The lettuce was super fresh. The blue cheese was flavorful. And they were generous with all the toppings. It is a little pricy for the size of salad. It was over $10 with tax for my regular sized salad. I get salads of a similar sized and quality premade at Trader Joe's for $5."}
{"text":"Worst meal in 4 years.   Thank goodness we only paid for one salad.  We will NEVER go back.  It wasn't one specific thing to point out - it was everything from entrance to exit.  Gahhhhh"}
{"text":"Decided to try this with a friend. I am starting my intention of eating cleaner and getting more greens in. The \"salad artists\" as they are called make your salad for you. I enjoyed my chicken caesar with the housemade croutons and even liked the yogurt dressing which had a little kick to it. I thought the size was fair for the price and I wouldn't hesitate to go again."}
{"text":"Customer service is great and appreciated the free meals but the food wasn't good. Might give another try."}
{"text":"LOVVVVVE this place!! I have yet to find something on the menu that I don't like. The staff is great and Miguel  was great conversation while he made my meals!"}
{"text":"Update: I did a take out order and they forgot my dressing :( down from 4 to 3 stars. Will update next time. Hopefully back up to 4 next time!

Pretty good salad place. It's awesome to have a healthy lunch option so close to my work. The place is clean and service is quick. 

Prices are a little high, I paid $12 for a salad and pita bread. Not terribly expensive or anything for me but probably wouldn't go more than once a week. A side of pita is only $1 so that's awesome. 

I will definitely go back and explore more menu options. Only four stars because it wasn't an amazing experience or anything, but still a good place for a quick healthy bite."}
{"text":"Had the salad here two times - both times severely underwhelmed.

Lettuce was far from fresh - chicken was really weird. 

Not sure if it was frozen then reheated, crusted in some weird spices (Had Cobb Salad last time around).  For a place with the name of 'mad greens' - I'd expect a much better Cobb.

Maybe other items on the menu are better but def no reason for me to go back here again."}
{"text":"I had large Siam Iam salad in ginger dressing, it was fresh and delicious! They are not kidding about the size, it was LARGE and of course I had to share with a friend, otherwise I won't be able to eat the whole thing.
 
This place is like the healthy version of fast food which is good sign for people who wants to stay healthy or become healthier, but for some reason I didn't feel the vibe atmosphere in this restaurant.

Maybe because this restaurant location is kind of a bit hid away from the main drag or it's just me?"}
{"text":"Love it. Healthy, clean food. It's what you need! 
You feel good leaving the table. Clean and healthy 
What a concept"}
{"text":"This is a very welcome addition to our neighbourhood.  Just went for a pre-opening event to sample their food before the official opening later this week.  It was advertised on their Facebook page.  I was greeted at the door and very nicely explained how the restaurant works.  Fantastic concept, make your own or choose a pre made salad mixture.  

Large has more greens but the same amount of protein (chicken etc.) so that's why the pricing is so close.  I made my own using romaine, kale,citrus grilled chicken, grilled sweet onions, mushrooms, shrimp, cheddar, croutons and the best part, the unique dressing I chose.  Sherry molasses vinaigrette!  It was fantastic, everything was super fresh!  On their website if you click nutrition it will show every ingredient used for everything on the menu as well!  So nice for those of us with dietary restrictions due to allergies etc. 

Lastly, didn't get to try this since they aren't open yet, you can order online and just pick up your salad, sandwich or wrap without the wait!  Can't wait to become a regular officially!"}
{"text":"Loved the Siam I Am salad. Delicious and filled me up with healthy and light ingredients. My son loved the kids box filled with chicken, pasta, veggies and fruit. The place was clean and staff was friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Much better experience during my second visit. They added more greens this time. Yay Big salads!"}
{"text":"I walk in intending to try a salad as I saw this was a newly opened restaurant from a yelp a reminder.  Overall the salad and service were good. It would've been nice to have somebody at the front counter explain the whole process as opposed to the assumption that I knew how it worked.  Also could be friendlier.  I like the use of locally sourced vegetable"}
{"text":"this is my second time eating here and I loved it. First time I got the Annie Oakley wrap which was delicious and this time I got the Bonnie Parker Salad."}
{"text":"For some reason I thought this place was a healthier option, not so much. I got the BLT wrap. Lots of lettuce, tortilla and dressing. Not bad but I basically ended up throwing the tortilla away and eating my wrap as a salad.  

My friend got a Annie Oakley paninis and was upset about the amount of calories they took in and how dry their sandwich was. 

I was sad that there were no actually soda products like coke or pepsi. I ended up going next door to the water and ice place to get a coke. 

The best part was we were able to order online."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for lunch a week or so after they'd opened, and we had a great time.  Food options are limited, ie only three or four sandwiches, three or four wraps, etc.  But you know what, by concentrating on fewer items, then they make them well, so I'm very happy about that.  My wife had a salad, and I had a panini and a cup of soup.  Everything was wonderful.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"This place was surprising. I was surprised how no one was there when I stopped by and it worried me. Then I was surprised that it was just a salad bar basically. But I said what the heck, I'm here I'll try it. I was surprised at how friendly the staff was. They helped me decide, made good suggestions, and didn't make me feel like an inconvenience.

But I was most surprised at how freaking good that salad was haha. I got the Dionysos and it was so good. The olives, the dressing, and having it all made tossed up for me was perfect. I don't go for just salads often, but if I'm ever in the mood, Mad Greens is where I plan on going.

They also support Maine Root. One of my favorite beverage companies. When I saw that, I knew they were a good place. If you've never had a Maine Root soda, do yourself a favor and try one. I hope they'll stock the pumpkin pie soda made by Maine Root in the fall. It's my favorite!!

All in all a good place, trendy vibe, and cleaner than most sit down restaurants I've been to. If I was a big salad person this would probably get a 5 star."}
{"text":"I could get the Siam I Am salad every day of my life and be a happy camper. The peanut dressing is just wonderful, and the crunch of the quinoa and lettuce is great, too. I just wish the quinoa didn't soak so much of it up, because I usually need to go a little heavier on the dressing. The Ty Cobb is great, as is the Edgar Allen Poe. I haven't tried any wraps yet. Oh! but the hummus is delicious too and I love, love, love how they make everything in-house!"}
{"text":"I love salads, i make them at home all the time but some times it is tideous to get all the ingredients, fresh and ready to go. Madgreens is always fresh and ready! I really appreciate the service at this location, as they accomodated all my requests on my build your own salad."}
{"text":"Absolutely live the concept of this place! I had the Pancho Villa and was pleased with how good it was. Being someone who isn't big on salads, this salad may have made me a believer."}
{"text":"Loved my Southwest bowl that I turned into a salad! No wild rice for me. It was perfect! The kind staff offered a spicy seasoning for the avocado and it added just the right amount of kick. I loved having the stevia sweetened green tea option too! I'll be back! Thank you."}
{"text":"Two week old/expired menu still prominently posted. Lost employees. Beverages out. Flavorless hummus trio. No service recovery. I've been in Austin and loves the concept but this location needs to get their shit together."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed I'm this place...when you make a salad you font just put all lettuce in you put more of the veggies...I mean all I'm eating is lettuce if I wanted that I would of gone to the store and bought my own...I paid 28.00 for two salad with just lettuce...then when I asked for a big Salad with half the lettuce so I can get more veggies the girl with the black hair argued with me saying I should just get the small one or you'll be charged for extra I said I'll pay extra but no she wouldn't let me do that...such a shit place I will NEVER come back!!"}
{"text":"Boring. Not what I had anticipated at all.. 13 dollars got me a soggy panini and a bland Caesar salad. Pretty disappointed for my first time. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"So happy that this restaurant opened up in our shopping center!!  We have been DYING for something healthy, quick & affordable to eat for lunch, and this has been our solution! The beet hummus, iced teas, salted caramel cookie, Don Quixote salad, and vegetarian chicken are our favs!!  Everyone who works there is so sweet and they are progressing very quickly.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing! I was super excited to try this place as a healthy option near my house and what a let down it was!

Ordered the Ty Cobb. Avocado was rock hard and romaine was mostly yellow/white and not green. 

Probably won't be returning!"}
{"text":"I hope I am remembering her name correctly because Laura (Laurie?), a very friendly older woman with medium/short hair, was super helpful during my first visit to MAD Greens. I had no idea what I wanted or what dressings were good and she was able to help me create a delicious custom salad. It was overall a great experience and I will be back because of the great customer service!"}
{"text":"I have been there twice and had the Bonnie Parker. I ordered a large and it was quite a bit of salad. Enjoyed the outdoor patio area out back."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying Mad Greens as its a new local restaurant. To my surprise it was empty when I went in. I had gotten a coupon in the meal for a free salad. I tried the steak salad. The Edgar Allen Poe. I had a few complaints about this salad and mind you they really weren't complaints. First if you're going to offer steak on a salad I would like the option of having warm steak. Cold steak on lettuce just isn't that great. The other thing I like about Mad greens but was a little disappointed was with the homemade dressing. It was good but a pinch of salt goes along way. Just saying. I'll definitely go back though and try a different salad. Great customer service too."}
{"text":"I love this place everything from the wraps to the drinks yummy.  I eat here at least 1x a week"}
{"text":"I was a little intimidated by all the choices when I first came here. I've found my favorites and I'm a fan... the mad Caesar with mad spice and light dressing. And when I want to indulge, the salted caramel cookie is oh so good. The food is fresh and the restaurant is clean. The portions are also really generous. Erik and Delaney had especially awesome customer service and were super helpful and friendly. For days/nights I want to grab a quick salad, soup or sandwich or just pickup a fresh juice, it's my go-to place."}
{"text":"I tried the Pancho Villa Salad but instead of baby greens, I got romaine lettuce. I also added MAD Spice avocado. Their MAD Spice is so...good!!! Food is fresh. Place is clean. Oh...and I like their drinks! I had pink lemonade that was made with prickly pear."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times recently and the staff continues to disappoint me. I came in the other day by myself and the place was empty and the tables had dishes on them that looked like they had been sitting there for a long time. I stood at the counter for 5 minutes and even walked to the other side of the counter to see if there were even employees in the store at the time. I saw three people, each of them not giving a crap whether or not there was a customer. Finally, someone came out to help me and acted like I was a complete inconvenience to have come to the establishment in the first place.

{"text":"Love this place. The staff is so friendly every single time. I usually just get the caesar salad! The chipotle caesar is AMAZING! They make their own sodas as well. Love this spot"}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill since it opened. I used to come here regularly and enjoy their ability to make a quick, fresh salad to my specifications during my short lunch break. Today, I showed up at 11:30 am. Waited in line for 15 minutes. They made my salad soooo slowly. I asked for a \"tad bit more dressing please\" and the woman scowled at me and said \"you can have as much as you want\" and proceeded to squirt about half the bottle on as I watched in dismay. I cannot eat this salad I just paid $10 for. Like, it's liquid now. They were out of ice tea. They were out of napkins. They were out of lids for the salad bowls and wrapped saran wrap on the top of mine, which fell apart on the drive back to the office. I would understand if they were out of all these things AFTER the lunch rush, at say 2pm. But at 11:30 am? Clearly nobody bothered to prep for the day. The cashier tried to ring me up for a bunch of items that weren't mine. What a disaster."}
{"text":"Quick and healthy and made fresh to order. My kind of place. Salad bowls are stuffed to the brim and very filling. I try to try a new salad every visit. But my favorite so far is the Ivan. 
I hardly ever drink soda. But i have to when i visit madgreens. They have a really fun organic soda selection. 
Staff is always super friendly and helpful with suggestions and the establishment is clean."}
{"text":"The variety of salads are great! The staff are super friendly and always start a conversation which I love! The soda bar has some spunky different flavors that you won't find anywhere else! So pleased this is just around the corner"}
{"text":"I had a bad first experience here (lots of pieces of bone in my steak salad). It took me a long time to give this place a second chance but I'm glad I did. Nice, fresh salads, paninis and a couple of soup choices each day. I recommend the southwest chicken over the citrus for more flavor. Even the small salads are huge. Unless you are starving or sharing with a friend, you don't need the big one. I love their Maine sodas too. I'd give four stars if I hadn't had that first very bad experience."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch here! The salads are great and so is the iced tea. This place is a healthy choice and perfect for hot AZ days!"}
{"text":"The food was great! I really enjoy how quick and healthy it is, and that I can grab something yummy and be on my way. 

I def. will be back. 

I got a build your own - kale, egg, avocado, bacon and cucumbers :) 
Topped off with a balsamic ving. dressing :) SO GOOD"}
