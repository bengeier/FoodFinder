{"text":"My goodness me! It's a regular \"Dump on Los Sombreros Festival\" here in Yelpland. Hey, people -- it's a perfectly fine Mexican restaurant. Well, maybe it's not perfect, but my meals here over the past five years have always been good, and I consider Los Sombreros a great place to take out-of-town guests. If I were to grade it on a pretentiousness scale, it actually rates better and is more inviting than Barrio Cafe. So give the place a break -- try the guacamole, the chicken mole, the lamb adobo, any of the skirt steak entrees and any of the seafood dishes."}
{"text":"I hate to offer a poor review but the guacamole was bland, my entrée was warm at best, and the kitchen made my son beef instead of the chicken tacos he ordered.  The waiter was kind enough to return the two meals, but my my entree came back microwaved and mushy.  Sadly, it was my husband's birthday.  While I appreciate the comped beer, it won't bring us back."}
{"text":"A great menu that isn't the standard cookie-cutter fajitas and burritos mexican menu.  A lot of very good choices.  The staff has the feel of a family run business with everyone very friendly.  We went to the North Scottsdale location and we must have caught them on an off night however.  The kitchen was backed up even though the restaurant was less than half full and it took 45minutes to get tacos and pollo con espinacas although people seated after us were getting their meals quickly.  When it came, the vegetables in the espinacas were still icy although the chicken was warm so i'm not sure the order everything was put together.  My water glass was cracked and even though I pointed it out early, it wasn't replaced.    Our waitress was very apologetic for the delay and the cracked glass, but no consideration was made on the bill and for a restaurant charging a premium, I expected more.  We probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Horrifying!  Friday night after a long work week we were looking forward to trying the new restaurant in our neighborhood in north Scottsdale,  We were seated immediately and our waitress introduced herself moments later.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer of guacamole and chips.  The house chardonnay was exceptional but the beer was warm.  The guacamole was so spicy it left blisters in our mouths.  We waited nearly a half an hour for our waitress to return to take our order before we gave up and left.  Our bill for uneaten guacamole, a warm unfinished beer and a most enjoyable glass of wine was more than $20.00.  Lastly, although I don't think that north Scottsdale Los Sombreros will be in business 10 months from now, the staff should be advised that fragrances are a \"no no\".   Chanel's signature fragrance should be saved for \"date night\" since diners would rather smell their food if they could get an order in.  North Scottsdale has many excellent Mexican restaurants.  Los Sombreros is not one of them.  Skip this one."}
{"text":"I like the feel on the patio and the bar was pretty cool looking.The service was fast but the parking was limited.  I didnt eat here but I did hang out and have drinks and chips. The chips were ok but the salsa was Fabulous! I probably had 4 bowls of it.  Once again, I got my favorite Cruz Tequila Margarita. Steve behind the bar recomended it and made me a deliciouse one with gran marnier? whatever it was, it was delicious and we had 2 each at the table. I always like a place that recomends my favorite drinks!  I would go back, the drinks are good and the atmosphere was nice"}
{"text":"My wife and I left this evening (Cinco de Mayo) without being served or approached 15 minutes after seating ourselves in the bar. When we got up to leave the manager/bar tender asked where we were going, and when I told her wasn't any staff to wait on us on this usually bust night in Mexican restauarants she said ahe didn't have time for any complaints...totally non-professional. Needless to say, we won't return in the future."}
{"text":"When you arrive ask for Ernesto!   We have never been here before and its a more traditional Mexican restaurant than those i have been at before. I haven't heard names/ingredients for some of the food options, and he was very good at explaining each option.   Food was DELICIOUS and the beverages were perfect for a warm sunny day in Scottsdale. For margarita choices, all you gotta do is tell them you desire, more/less sweet or more/less fruity and you be set!"}
{"text":"This has been one of our favorite spots for a long time,but the new bartender, Harry, CANNOT make a good margarita!  Steve used to be there but now works at Renegade Canteen.  Food is great and service good here though and worth trying."}
{"text":"Los Sombreros is the best authentic Mexican food in the valley.  That is a bold statement, especially with offerings like Barrio Café, but the attention to detail, authenticity and one of the coziest patios around makes Los my favorite Mexican spot. We have been several times and always order the same thing so this time around we thought we would try one of the new items on the menu.  I am so glad we did. We started with the crepes appetizer and the fig & panela salad. The crepes were amazing. They were filled with goat & blue cheese and had a delicious pomegranate sauce on top. The salad with figs had a honey lime dressing that was divine.  My husband usually gets the seafood crepes but had the Ribeye instead.  He was totally obsessed! He loved that it was covered with a chipotle and pineapple salsa. And of course every time we go we have to get their tasty margaritas and the chips and guacamole. You can't go wrong with those!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday. The service was very attentive, the food good. The beans are the best I have had in any mexican restaurant. The lamb birria was ok. The guacamole was very good."}
{"text":"I met a group of friends here and we all loved the food and atmosphere. The guacamole is fantastic along with the hibiscus enchiladas.  I spilt the chicken enchilada dinner and we both loved the slightly spicy flavor. The patio has nice ambience and the wait staff was excellent. It's not the cheapest restaurant around but it's worth it. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is truly horrible. The prices only add salt to your wound.   There are a lot of great Mexican restaurants in AZ and they are not hard to find. You do not need to pay extra to go to this place. I saw a review in Phoenix magazine and decided to check this place out. The only explanation I can possibly think of is that the  reporter got lazy and decided to skip on the meal and browse the website instead. Literally everything we got from our chips and salsa to our main entrees (recommended by the waiter) was bland.   The patio is cute although we had to sit by some tanks of gasoline which wasn't really a good vibe. While I'm sure this place is healthier than some of the other mexican restaurants it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican. You can tell the food is homemade, good quality and fresh! I liked that it wasn't greasy like other cheaper Mexican."}
{"text":"You want the BEST Mexican Food around, this is the place! I've been coming here for years, sending friends, and family and never had anything less then excellent. I'm not sure why anyone gave this place anything but 5 Stars, unless you're expecting Fast & Salty..  For authentic excellent food; this is The Place!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious great ambiance almost feels like a little place in Mexico. The patio looked relaxing but was still a little hot out. Definitely go back for the dishes that I wanted but did not order. Chille rellenos were excellent as well as the chocolate tamale which is great with coffee. If you are interested in a little something different with very bold flavors and fresh ingredients its a must."}
{"text":"This place is the best. I love their food.  They've always been great about doing special orders - vegetarian without cheese- and it still tastes authentic.  Check out their happy hour too-- they don't get a lot of people for it, but it's pretty good."}
{"text":"AMAZING Tequila selection. Met a friend for an early dinner on the patio. Chips and salsa starters are great.  I had the seafood taco, she had the steak. Both were excellent in taste and size. Prices are a little high, but if you want cheap, Super Burrito is across the street. Great looking place and patio. Service from bartender was friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, friendly service, and a comfortable patio with trees instead of a parking lot view. The chicken mole and carnitas are awesome. The green enchiladas rock. Try the watermelon agua fresca margaritas for something different. The restaurant even supports local causes."}
{"text":"Meh. I only went here because I heard the chef at my new fave restaurant in Sedona used to own this place. Hoped the food would be as good.   Looked great. Tasted very sterile and like it was all premade Mexican.  Skip!"}
{"text":"I would not feed their food to starving ethiopian child. I ordered the chilis rellenos. It was a bowl full oil to start. The batter on the chilis had the texture of soggy bread. The chilis themselves had the consistency of tire that was filled with mozzarella and corn. I am about 90% positive they were frozen to start and just placed in a bowl and microwaved. The overall consensus of the group of 6 I was with was the same or worse. I was nauseated by the smell of my brothers fish which could smelled over the entire patio which was similar to the smell of a tackle box. Everyone is is basing their review off the patio seating but there was nothing more special about it other than the fact it was outside. The most genuine thing there was the mr. Pibb and my discontent.My favorite part of the meal was excusing myself from the table and smoking a cigarette. Even the margaritas and chips and salsa were subpar...didnt know that was plausible. Go to taco bell..."}
{"text":"As first time visitors to a Los Sombreros establishment, we were impressed ... it was a Thursday night, we were warmly welcomed upon entering by Jacob and we were asked what our seating preferences were (hightop, booth or table). Jacob was also our server for the evening and he was efficient and knowledgeable about the menu. Chips & salsas were immediately placed on the table and our drinks were not far behind. We were not rushed while deliberating our choices but once the order was placed, the food was promptly on the table. Service was very good (would we like more chips, salsa, more drinks, water?). All in all it was a great dining experience and the food was excellent and generously portioned - lamb adobo, chile rellenos ground beef picadillo. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Small menu with high prices, I know it's Scottsdale however paying 3.95 for chips and salsa is crazy. Staff was not very accommodating, when asked to seat is on the patio the waiter informed us it was to cold hmmmm it was 74 degrees outside. Will not return ......"}
{"text":"Our hotel concierge recommended this place.  We sat outside under the heating lamps and the vibe was great.  The appetizers were quite tasty (seafood tacos were yummy while the chorizo fondue was not what we expected but still okay).   The entrees were not that great.  We only had to wait 5 minutes, but then it was also a Sunday night.   Portions are pretty large... we ended up doggy bagging half our entrees."}
{"text":"It finally hit me that this is the same place as their other Scottsdale location so we rushed over as I've had several great experiences there and knew the food was fantastic.   The choices were difficult as many things sounded great so my son and I opted to share the 10 course tasting menu which was as amazing as it sounded! My daughter ordered from the kids menu and got a generous portion that she loved too.   This is not your ordinary Mexican fare so don't come expecting a big menu of fajitas and burritos. If you want crap Mexican food like Arriba, go to Arriba but if you want great food, come around the block here and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican meal we've had in Phoenix.  - Molotes Poblano (spicy):  3 crispy masa patties stuffed generously with chorizo and potato with roasted tomato and a big heap of their popular guacamole   - Green Corn Tamales:  2 moist and light tamales filled with a subtly sweet corn filling  - Blue Crab Enchiladas: lots of crab with perfectly sauteed squashes and black beans  There was no charge for the large basket of perfectly fried chips and spicy salsa.  Service was super helpful and friendly.  The patio was made even more enjoyable by the cool evening breezes."}
{"text":"After not having visited Los Sombreros for a few years, my husband and I went back to celebrate his birthday. Right away we were happy with the chips and salsas, and the guacamole was fresh and tasty, but dinner proved to be a mixed experience. We both had the mole poblano, which is shredded chicken in a Puebla-style mole. The mole was fantastic, with a complex and pleasing flavor. The chicken, however, was inconsistent between our two plates. About 90 percent of my chicken was dry; my husband had more moist than dry chicken on his plate. I was disappointed, especially given the cost ($18.95), but the mole sauce helped the dryness, and then there was that lovely, fluffy rice, and the wonderfully creamy refried beans. I'm thinking the dry chicken was due to an off night, but I can't say I'm in a rush to go back. There are too many other good Mexican restaurants in metro Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have passed this restaurant on my way to and from work everyday and never thought to try it until I read the Best of Phoenix and they described Hibiscus Enchiladas.  My friend and I just left and we both agreed we need to tell people about this place. We started with Spinach Quesos Fundidos  a great cheese covered appetizer, I got the Hibiscus Enchilada and my friend had the Chicken Enmoladas. It was all just delicious! Jesus our server was a gracious host, checking on us throughout the meal and thanking us for coming in.  All in all a great  experience, the food very fresh and served  warm, the atmosphere and service are both warm and welcoming. If you haven't tried it, I suggest you do!"}
{"text":"I used to be a Los Sombrero's local. Started going (1998) before they were in their current location. The past few years Los Sombreros has gone hill. Increasing prices and food not as good. Marg's are subpar now. Los Sombrero's is no longer living up to what it used to be. Food is still good, just no longer great. All great things change and I am sad to see Los Sombreros change for the worse.   The original chef/owner Jeff Smedstad has left and started Elote in Sedona - I must try there as I here it's what Los Sombreros used to be."}
{"text":"I went to Los on a slow Tuesday night.. it took over 5 minutes for someone to take our drink orders and another 5 minutes to get our drinks.  The waitress had to cone back two times to clarify our order.  We ordered tacos and the chicken enchiladas.   Both were incredibly bland, no flavor at all.  When they are charging 17$ for a dish I have higer expectations.  The best part of my meal was the beans.   Ins short.. bad service.. boring food.. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great food, great drink. I had the crab enchiladas (very good) and a Margarita Flight (1 Patron, 1 Passion Fruit and 1 I do not remember). This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Los Sombreros was truly a WONDERFUL place. We went for lunch, and got the chips with salsa and guacamole, which was the BEST POSSIBLE STARTER!!! For a main course, I got the Carne Asada (beef) and it was amazing! It was the perfect portion, but I had a lot of chips and guacamole, so it may be a little small,or even too small, depending on your appetite.   Also, we got the Chicken Emoulada, which was delicious. It was not too filling, and even a little tangy, but in the best way possible. It was perfect!   The service & atmosphere were wonderful. We *thoroughly* enjoyed ourselves!!"}
{"text":"I can't say that anything was great at Los Sombreros!  The margaritas were bland, the salsa is not like any salsa I've ever seen before, the chicken tacos were tasteless.  I'll never go back there again...although our waitress was darling and attentive."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Los Sombreros has gone downhill over the years. The food has lost flavor, the bar area is cluttered and the owner can always be heard yelling at and criticizing her staff. The poor servers are so scared to mess up they provide for an uncomfortable, unwarm atmosphere.   I suggest considering one of the many other pleasant Mexican food restaurants."}
{"text":"My daughter took us here for dinner as she had eaten there before and it was good food/service.  We were there on a weeknight and it was cold but because the had heated lanterns and small fire pits, we chose to eat on the patio.  Not all the lanterns were turned on and they sat us almost on top of the table next too us and it made it difficult to get in and out of our chairs. We asked to be seated somewhere else but they did'nt want to turn on the lanterns and it was a 30 min wait to get inside. That aside, the food was pretty good and the menu deffinately unique, but the service was very poor.  They were friendly but very slow and not very attentive and it wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"Great- pass on the tamales and chocolate tamale. Just not the best corn mesa. Great mole. Shrimp over cooked, but sauce was amazing."}
{"text":"I felt the prices were much too high. The food quality was so-so. I've had much better for less.  Unfortunately for my son, he ordered a crab and mango salad topped with pieces of crab shell! He is still in pain from possibly cracking his tooth. I even picked a piece out that was so sharp it would have perforated his digestive track if swallowed. Good thing I'm not interested in feeding my 11 month old seafood quite yet, who happened to be with us.  I informed the waiter whose reply was, \"Well it's real crab.\" Ya! I can tell!  I did get his meal comped but I will NOT be going back. I felt that was too careless.  OH AND BY THE WAY, THE PATIO HAS BIRD POOP EVERYWHERE. YOU ARE SITTING UNDER HUGE TREES. BEAUTIFUL MIND YOU, BUT MY SON ALSO HAD SOME FRUIT FALL OUT OF THE TREE ONTO HIS PLATE AS WELL."}
{"text":"This is my favorite salsa in the bay area. I get their steak tacos, pico on the side, side of cheese as well. Chop up the jala-pep-pep they give you, add it on there with the cheese, pico, scoop of salsa. Don't forget to squeeze that lime on top. BOOM! I like the greener salsa only. Cannot vouch for anything else on their menu."}
{"text":"It is seldom that I feel like I will never return to a restaurant under any circumstances and this is one of them.  The restaurant was expensive and the food was terrible.  The salsas were bordering on tasteless, the entrées huge.  I had the regular chili rellenos.  They were swimming in a tasteless sauce, with very little chili taste.  I managed to get one of the huge rellenos down.  My side was refried beans.  They were good.  We took the remaining relleno home for my husband's lunch the next day.  He ate the beans but he also could not eat the Relleno, and it hit the garbage can.  I seldom write reviews but I feel that this is one that needs to be written.  Please read the other other reviews.  I found them to be true even down to the chip in the salsa bowl."}
{"text":"I am totally shocked that some on here have had bad experiences because, in my view, this is as good as it gets.  I've been a big fan of Los Sombreros since I first went to it when it was located in the strip mall by the Big Lots.  There was absolutely nothing I could complain about there - not Tex Mex, but real Mexican food.  The salsa is smoky and five star.  I am personally a fan of battery-acid hot food and they had a habanaro salsa that was, well, YIKES and YUM at the same time.  The guacamole is one of the best I've ever had and the seafood tacos appetizer is something I absolutely love and think of often made with crema - not Americanized sour cream.   They are amazing.  I also am in love with the crab enchiladas and the puerco en mole verde.  My husband - a definite mole afcionado, loves their mole poblano and rates it second to none.  Margaritas are very good and the chocolate tamal with that carmel sauce and ice cream....wow.  I have taken four different people here on different occasions and all of them agreed it was sublime."}
{"text":"Great margaritas, gauc, queso, and tacos. We went to lots of fancy restaurants on our trip to Phoenix, but this place was better than all of them."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant of any variety! The restaurant has recently changed ownership and the menu is outstanding. I've had several of the poblano meals and each was delicious. It's not on the menu but you must try the espinaca queso. Seriously the best appetizer ever! Fresh spinach, peppers, onions and tomatoes with lots of cheese and chipotle crema--to die for! There is a lovely patio for outdoor dining and it has private parking. Go there now!"}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow. We had to get our own water pitcher after waiting 20 minutes! The good was okay, but over-priced. We won't eat here again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to stop in to Los Sombreros after not eating there for over a year. We sat outside at the bar and even though it was 105 out it was quite nice under the fans and misters. The steak tacos were delicious along with the tasty margaritas. Geoff was a great bartender and the atmosphere was great. I highly recommend stopping in and trying out this hidden south Scottsdale gem."}
{"text":"I was in a great mood and primed to enjoy this place.....uhhhh....did not happen. Sooo disappointed. Walked in at lunchtime today...3/24/15.  One other customer in the place. Was met by a lethargic bartender who informed us we could sit where we wanted. Great! We sat outside at the cleanest table we could find. Ordered margaritas. The table was covered in salt and sticky. Margaritas showed up...they were pretty tasty.... ordered food and asked the barkeep to bring a wet rag to wipe the table....he came back and took one slow swipe by each of us with a dirty rag. Then proceeded to bring salsa and chips and two plates. Both plates had dried up green food debris on them. We cancelled order and split. It really was dirty. Can you imagine what the kitchen must look like if that is the best they can present to clients? I am not a picky eater either....I have raised livestock all my life....hard to imagine all the junk I have ingested with dirty horse hands...probably am immune to just about everything...but this place was below sub-standard. Beware."}
{"text":"We held my husband's 60th birthday celebration on the patio at Los Sombreros and the evening was nothing short of magical.  Yolanda and Jesus, our servers, were so positive, flexible and accommodating, making sure everything was just right.  Azucena and the kitchen staff produced 24 amazing, hot meals all at once, never missing a beat and topping the evening off with incredible homemade desserts to include caramelized flan, chocolate mousse, chocolate tamale...WOW!  We love the authentic, beautifully prepared food from the guacamole to the Salmon with mango pico de gallo to the Puerco En Chipotle roasted pork in a chipotle-tomatillo sauce.  If you have not experienced Los Sombreros you have missed one of the hidden gems in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times, but it had been a while, so I decided to go back with my family during Arizona Restaurant Week.  We actually ended up ordering off of the regular menu instead of the fixed menu.    We started with the guacamole - if you like guac, this is a must! It is not tableside like my other favorite upscale Mexican restaurant, but it is still great.  The chips it is served with are good - not too salty - but the salsa they serve is marginal.  They offer two kinds, which were both very watery and bland, but maybe I am just really picky having been raised on homemade spicy salsa?   For my entree, I ordered the smoked chicken enchiladas.  These were absolutely amazing.  It was heaven in my mouth.  When I took that first bite, I literally just sat there and savored all the flavors exploding in my mouth.  The chicken was so tender and smoky, and the green sauce was a little tangy yet spicy.  The enchiladas came with black beans and rice, which nicely complemented the entree.  The rest of my family ordered the mole poblano, which was white meat chicken (you have to request this) drenched in mole sauce.  I love mole sauce, and this was definitely one of the better ones I've had.   I would recommend heading here when the weather cools down because they have a great patio and live music out there.  The ambiance inside is pretty unmemorable, and the service inside was not that great either.  Hopefully, it is better outside - that along with some better salsa would make my Los Sombreros experience complete!"}
{"text":"How can you not give this 5 stars!!! The chicken enchiladas with the mole sauce are divine. Fish tacos are unlike anything I have ever tasted. The jalapeño margarita is a jug of spice and tequila. I could not stop gorging. This is what you dream of when you are craving quality Mex!!"}
{"text":"We liked the one in South Scottsdale but the new one has poor service & cold food   We wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Finally authentic Mexican in north Scottsdale! Btw to Review/Maria if you really lived in Mexico you'd know they don't have an inch of Cheddar on their beans!!"}
{"text":"Was expecting a lot more.  Food was pretty good.  Salsa and chips were awesome.  Service was definitely sub-par.  We had to ask for drinks.  We had to ask for water.  We had to ask for more salsa and chips.  Sigh. And every time we asked, the waiter would look at ask like \"really - you want more water?\"  Then, even though it was a Wednesday night and not crowded at all, they kept trying to kick us out (they tried to take my plate twice while I was still eating).  I probably won't go again."}
{"text":"I visited here for lunch one day with some friends of mine.  The service was fairly standard and the food was pretty good.  It seemed clean enough and I had the Tijuana Donkey.  Pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is good, but I think I just ordered the wrong thing. The Hibiscus Enchiladas were just way too sweet for me. I think they should be on the dessert menu and not dinner menu. I'd like to give it another chance and order something else next time, but other than that a good vibe. Seemed like the typical American Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"We walked in and I think it was right as they were opening. We opted for inside as it was just a little too cool to sit on the patio. Our plan was just to have a small meal and everything was just outstanding. With so many Mexican food restaurants here in Scottsdale, from chain to tex-mex to a truly authentic location like Los Sombreros. I think its hard to get a unique spin on a classic but they do a wonderful job. Next time I'll enjoy the patio and a signature margarita!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with Los Sombreros. This is a tough thing for me to say because I adore Mexican food. Living in CA, TX and now AZ, I think I've had my fair share of Mexican food and this place doesn't measure up by a long shot.. The food  is very average and fairly expensive for what you get.   The portions were okay, but I still left unsatisfied and hungry..  There are plenty of good Mexican places that serve way better food at almost half the price of Los Sombreros entrees.   I thought the salsa was excellent. Service was decent.  I'm feeling generous-2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Tried this place because of a groupon.  Good thing it was at a discount, because it was not worth the money.  While the location and building are very authentic and unique for the area, that is about all this place has going for it.  I can't give a mexican restaurant a good review when they charge for chips and salsa, especially when the salsa is below average.  I ordered the smoked chicken enchiladas and was disappointed.  First the waitress messed up my order.  I clearly said I wanted the beans and rice, this is a mexican restaurant, right?  For some reason my mexican food comes out with grilled seasonal vegetables and black beans.  Umm...ok.  I didn't complain, bc I didn't want to wait any longer for my food.  But this is definitely a first.  Overall, the enchiladas lacked flavor and the tortillas were hard.    I will not return."}
{"text":"Visited for dinner...pleasant surprise.  The ambiance was great and the place very quaint.  I had an iced tea to go with my pollo a la parrilla.  It was great tasting and very authentic food.  Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I had to have Tex-Mex food during my trip to Arizona. Los Sombreros was so much more than that. It's actually more gourmet and fancy Mexican food served with delicious sauces and in a variety of non traditional ways. My family and I were pleasantly surprised that they offered a tasting menu because we were able to taste many of their inventive foods. Also, their margaritas are very refreshing."}
{"text":"We came here with 10 ppl, and had no problem making reservations on a Saturday night. Service was excellent, and the food was spot on! Loved the ambience of this place. Would definitely return if I were back in Scottsdale.   My only complaint is the pricing. I found it a tad high. The food was good, yes, but 18-25$ good? I feel I've eaten just as well for cheaper. I guess you're paying for the \"feel\" of the place as well."}
{"text":"I was looking for chile rellenos and this place does a great job of making them just the way I like it.  Flavorful and not dry.   Also had the chips and salsa which I did not think were anything special and you have to order them unlike most Mexican places where it is expected at the time they serve the drinks.  Flan was unimpressive.  I think I will go back for the chile rellenos and head down the street to Carlsbad Tavern for the flan (theirs is my favorite)."}
{"text":"We tried to get here for the 10 course tasting meal before the end of the month. Since we live 15 miles away we called on Friday at 5 to see if we could make a reservation before driving all the way there. Their policy in general about reservations is to not take any except for parties of 5 or more and it applied to the special dinner as well. I asked if there was any problem getting in that evening. \"No problem, come on in.\" We left right away and got there a little after 5:30. Well, there were problems. First was parking. There is limited on site parking, all taken. There is street parking on Virginia Street and extending into the neighboring residential area, all taken. There was parking across the street but that was clearly marked as reserved for the business in that location. I waited in the car for ten minutes for a spot while my wife went in to see what the situation was and to get a table, if possible. After ten minutes a spot opened up in the parking lot but before I could back up and take it, someone else arrived and slipped into the spot right in front of me. Maybe they are regulars and know that when it comes to parking courtesy goes by the wayside. Frustrated I left the car in the middle of the lot and went in to see what was happening to my wife. She had stood for a few minutes at the entry before someone acknowledged her presence. She asked about a table for two and was told, with a wave of the arm, to take a seat anywhere on the left in the dining area and then that person walked away. And that is where she was sitting when I found her. She had not seen a waiter or received a menu. I wondered how long someone would have to wait before the staff realized they had a customer. At that point we left. What does this place need? Better parking, a reservation system at least for peak hours, and attentive staff. The food might be good but we wouldn't know."}
{"text":"A patio that doesn't just make you look at cars! That's the first thing you'll notice when you get here. On a weekend you can wait about 45 minutes, but just get a designer margarita and enjoy the view and the action. FYI, it's a lot of food. I usually just order an appetizer as my main course."}
{"text":"We went here because Zagat said \"this is where the locals go,\" and we were not let down. Authentic and flavorful food makes this a must-stop location on our trips here. While your food cooks, nothing beats a great-made ice-cold margarita after a hot golf round."}
{"text":"Quite enjoyed the atmosphere and authentic Mexican food. The Quesadillas were tremendous. The pork entrée was also quite nice. Moreover the southwestern hospitality was appreciated. The owner was as friendly as can be. Recommended!  Rob Baker Hamilton Ontario, Canada."}
{"text":"Hostess seating us was a little disengaged, but that's my only complaint about this place. Started with a great margarita. Appetizer of sopecitos with cochinita pibil. Then had the chiles rellenos and the chicken enchiladas. Fresh, delicious and all prepared with a real homemade feel. Barely had room but made space for the plain flan which was a delight as well. Overall a great meal."}
{"text":"Brunched here with a friend.  Outstanding atmosphere, service, and some of the best Mex food I've had in the area.  Will go again. . .many times."}
{"text":"While visiting our friend in Phoenix, she took us to Los Sombreros, a Mexican restaurant that she had seen featured on TV.  Authentic Mexican food, beautifully prepared.  Joaquin was our waiter.  He was great.  We had margaritas.  They were great.  I thought the food was some of the best Mexican food I have ever eaten.  We ate outside on the patio and had a wonderful meal.  I had the chicken enchiladas and my husband had the fish tacos.  All the flavors were subtle and everything was cooked perfectly.  Typical American location, a shopping mall.  But at least you can find a place to park.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here for many years and loved it.  The last couple times were not so good and last night (9/25/10) was awful.  The margarita was weak tasting and half way through it, it was like bad water - all for $8.50.  They have also changed the salsa and we don't think it was very flavorful.  We had the tomato and cheese appetizer, which was very tasty but the salt level was extremely high.  My wife ordered the chicken mole and I ordered the pork dish in green sauce (not the carnitas).  We do not typically send food back but my wife's chicken was very tough.  They brought a second dish, which was more tender - this leads me to believe the first chicken was either leftover or burnt and they just covered it in sauce and served it.  My pork and the sauce it was in was tasty but over half the pork was either solid fat or grisly meat.  I happen to like leaner cuts.  We ate at the bar and watched the bartender make the margarita mix in a bucket.  After making the mix, he poured an awful lot of water on top of it.  No wonder our $8.50 drinks were so watery.  We have been told the owner does not allow the wait staff to come in until 15 minutes before opening - likely to save costs.  Unfortunately, the cost cutting has also affected the food and drink quality.  Sorry - this restaurant is off our list permanently."}
{"text":"I've become a regular here, and I actually begin to miss this place if I go more than a couple of weeks without a visit.  It isn't so much that the ambiance readily engages or celebrates Mexican spirit and charm (it doesn't), or that seating is otherwise comfortable and spacious (it can be tight and some inside tables sit high).  But the food is amazing, the margaritas are my favorites anywhere, and the service has been excellent (with one rare exception when it seemed to take exorbitantly long for our waitress to initially appear).    I'm one of those rare individuals in the southwest who doesn't generally care for guacamole ... pureed avocado (to baby food consistency) with chopped tomatoes is generally not my thing.  But I genuinely can't get enough of the guacamole at Sombreros.  Its chunky avocado, cilantro, tomatoes, lime, and cheese are perfectly put together and served with chips that can carry the load while still managing to be light.  My wife and I typically throw caution to the wind (given that we intend to order dinner entrees, as well), and order the large portion.  There's never any left and we duel for the last bits with warring chips (I hate to admit I lose most of the time).  Although the guacamole is by far our favorite, other appetizers are excellent as well.  The queso fundido (with multiple choices for fillings) is very good, and my wife swears by the huitlacoche crepas, which she often has as a main course to follow the guacamole.  We've never had any entrée that didn't live up to expectation, and the Puerco en Chipotle is a favorite that is hard to ignore every time we come.  The pork is incredibly tender and juicy, the chipotle sauce (more like a juice) is spicy without being overwhelming.  With a couple of warm tortillas if you want them, its hard to leave a bite behind.  The Lamb Adobo is excellent as well, and the Pollo con Espinacas (with a chipotle cream sauce) is a spicy taste treat.  The Puerco en Mole Verde received high marks as well.  The entrees come with two traditional sides, and beans, rice, etc. are all fine but nothing exceptional.  Always hoping to find a great margarita when we're out, I've tried many.  There are some good ones to be found to be sure, but I'm impressed by the quality and pour at Sombreros.  My personal favorite is the Cadillac, but there are many excellent ones from which to choose and an outstanding selection of tequilas if you're partial to shots and chasers.    It's been a couple of weeks since I've been there ... I'm feeling the pull."}
{"text":"Went with a groupon - Probably the most disappointed i have been with one.  I am not sure what I had as it did not resemble what I had ordered (I thought anyway) and it was tasteless.  I just wanted to be done and really did not want to order anything else.  I have tried many Mexican restaurants in the valley and this has been my only disappointment, normally I am pleasantly surprised.  Sorry folks."}
{"text":"Don go here if you're looking for American Mexican food. Service is ok. We were told to seat ourselves inside and then the host acted all butt hurt when he came in and saw where we sat ourselves!  The guacamole appetizer is $6.95 for about 3/4 of a cup, so not worth it. BTW, chips and salsa are NOT complimentary, you only get them if you purchasable appetizer. Never heard of this at a Mexican restaurant. The drink menu is larger than the food menu. We had the carnitas, it was good.  Overall, we wanted to walk out when we first got there and wish we had. The carnitas was good, but not worth the overall experience. We were there while on vacation with another family and they will not split the bill for you and the add gratuity over five people. No Bueno!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! We've been twice and wouldn't hesitate to go back. The food always exceeds expectations and the patio has such a wonderful ambiance. Definitely recommend the guac and if you're vegetarian try the hibiscus enchiladas. They were so good and I haven't ever seen that dish anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is the best non-seafood Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix region. I compare it to Frontera Grill in Chicago. Both places are great. The patio is very inviting, as is the indoor part of the restaurant. Fresh, fresh food! Excellent guacamole. Really tasty Pork in mole verde, Lamb Adobo, and polle con espinacas!!! They close the restaurant annually to go down to Mexico to brush up on their cooking and keep the menu current.   Now - if you are not a foodie, and only think Mexican food is supposed to be smothered in cheese (like my father), don't go, because you'll be taking up a seat that should go to a real lover of fine cuisine. I have taken scores of family and friends to this place and everyone loves it, except my dad who is aging and seems to have no taste buds.  So sad for him."}
{"text":"Forget Macayos Mexican Food!  (I hope you already did) Forget what you knew about Tex Mex or other Mexican restaurants, or wannabes!  Take everything you love about Mexican food and make it gourmet with fabulous presentation, and place it just past downtown Scottsdale.  Los Sombreros is hip and fun with a great bar, wonderful tequila, and a nice outside seating area combined with some of best food I have tasted.  I have thoroughly enjoyed myself each time I have been here, and I will always go back.  Everything I have tried has been excellent.  The staff is friendly, and the restaurant is family owned.  This place is always busy, so there may be a bit of a wait, but I swear it will always be worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Los Sombreros for a long time. We went on Mothers' day. We saw the sign for margarita special, so we all ordered a round of the house margarita. During dinner, our party ordered another round of margaritas. When we received our check, the margaritas were a few dollars more than advertised......it added up for our party. We were then told the \"house\" margaritas were not the special. We should have been informed of that when we ordered. The extra cost was NOT taken off our bill. I definitely have a BAD taste in my mouth for this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to begin but from the moment we walked in the door the service was terrible. Our server had absolutely no personality and nor did anyone we saw. Then the food, mediocre at best. My tacos were not chicken, (which is what i ordered ) and for $47 (including tip) for LUNCH with NO cocktails I think it is safe to say we will never be returning. I work down the street as a hairstylist and unfortunately will be sharing our experience. Any Mexican restaurant that charges for chips and salsa automatically looses points. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"We can't get enough of Los Sombreros amazing food and the patio atmosphere is perfect 80% of the year.  You truly won't find anywhere else like it in Scottsdale.   We've brought along our toddler the last few times as we couldn't resist the enticement of Pollo con espinaca and they have been very accomodating."}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was there was no attempt at creating a comfortable environment. Food was good. High quality and fresh. BUT chips and salsa were $3.50 and when we asked for another round of salsa they charged us 2 bucks but didn't mention it. We found out when we got the bill. To finish it off, they don't take American express.  They don't understand how to make customers comfortable. So I strongly urge all potential patrons find another place to grab a taco."}
{"text":"Visisted this restaurant with my family recently.  I lived many years in Mexico so I know what the cusine should be like.  This restaurant is fairly authentic and has many things you don't find in other Mexican restaurants.  For the most part, their food is very good.  Of all the things we had, the only thing we didn't like was their \"Spanish\" rice.  It has an odd flavor because it is spiced with cumin.  Cumin is not used in Mexican cuisine (or if it is, it must be very rare).  The better dishes, like Lamb Adobo, are pricier than the usual snack-type meals like tacos but are worth it.  They don't provide complementary chips.  They have them but you have to pay for them (welcome to Scottsdale).  Their salsas have out of the ordinary flavors but are good.  They run mild.  So if you want decent heat, ask for their Habanero sauce.  They have Tecate beer, but not on tap :-(   Margaritas are good.  Their limeade is homemade and good.  Their desserts are delicious.  We had flan and a Mexican chocolate creme pie.  The service is very authentic.  This means that if you expect American service, you will be disappointed.  Mexican service is deliberately slow and waiters must be summoned for service.  It's a cultural thing.  People are expected to take a long time at meals, eating slowly to enjoy their meal and enjoying each other's company.  If you are in a hurry, this is not the place to go.  If you can handle this type of service, the food is worth the bother."}
{"text":"I will start by saying the smallest tip I have left in 10 years. Family just moved to Phoenix and we were recommended to come here. Many issues with this place: #1. Terrible service.  We literally had to ask for more water and another cocktail more than once and we had to beg for our check (table next to us was asking the same thing - she asked 3 times for their check)  #2. Food was bad. Carnitas was plain, plain, plain. My wife's enchilada was cold.  #3. Prices were RIDICULOUS!!!! For my wife and I to have enchilada dinner (cheese), carnitas dinner, guacamole with chips, and 2 margaritas was $65.70 before tip. That's insane....oh yeah dinner took 1 hr and 15 mins at a Mexican restaurant.   Diners beware!!!"}
{"text":"i went there last monday to have some dinner with some friends n WOW the food was awesome , i had the pork with chipotle n its sooooooo good n this is coming from a legit mexican , i will def go back there soon ....... if you go see Arturo the bartender he is very nice ."}
{"text":"The best mexican food! ! Cynthia was my server, and she was very friendly, and she recommended tampiqueña, and it was awesome, and chocolate tamal really good"}
{"text":"Really great service and tasty food! The margarita was delicious as well. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is authentic Mexican food. If you're looking for Tex-Mex or fresh-mex, this is not the place for you. (Think googling food items or speaking Spanish) they are pretty pricey (two people for $60), and have a lot of stipulations like not splitting checks and limits on soft drink refills. Overall, our was a fun environment and good service. We went at 5pm on a Monday, and it was not crowded, but I imagine it gets much more crowded toward the weekend and with all the students. There is a whole outdoor patio/dining room and bar separate from the main dining room. It's an adorable building. Check out the bathroom doors, they are AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I'm glad my friends referred me to this wonderful restaurant, I can't believe I drove past so many times and didn't realize what it was.   They offer up amazing guacamole, delicious mole dishes, great ambiance. True Sonoran fare. The rustic decor is charming, as is the staff and owners."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for amazing GUAC, chips and salsa! Atmosphere is great, food is even better!"}
{"text":"I rarely am motivated enough to write reviews but after tonight's awful experience at Los Sombreros, I felt I must.  We are visiting my parents and they were very excited to try this \"new\" restaurant that had recently been reviewed in the paper.  How sorry they are.  Our party of 7 called at 6:30pm and asked about arriving at 7pm for a party of seven.  \"No problem\" and \"what's your name?\" was the response and off we went.  We arrived and the greeter/hostesses were rude and said they didn't show a reservation for us.  We pointed it out and they said they couldn't honor/accommodate us.  As they saw our jaw drops, they akwardly walked off and tried to piece something together.  They offered us a table in the bar OR said we could wait 20 minutes for a table in the main dining room.  Having 3 kids with us, we elected for the bar.  We were seated at about 7:05 and then, after having our orders for drinks/food taken at 7:25, we still didn't receive anything (drinks or chips) until 7:45.  The drinks were wrong.  My 6-year old daughter ordered lemonade and was told they had it;  they didn't and brought her a Sprite.  She said she had ordered lemonade and they said they didn't hear her. They said they had \"homemade\" limeade so she agreed.  When it arrived at 8:00, she tasted it and told us it tasted weird.  My husband tried it and said it was margarita mix.  Seriously?   After numerous drink mix-ups and having servers come and verify and re-verify certain food orders, they brought our food out at 8:15.  Things were looking up!    The food:  2 of us got the smoked chicken enchiladas and they were good.  One of us got the carnitas and he said it was just \"ok.\"  The rice tasted awful but the beans were decent.  The food was all pretty cold (definitely the kitchen had not timed the food prep/service well) but we were done complaining.  It was up to them and they seemed to know we were not happy as the owner continued to avoid us like the plague despite her servers telling her how badly things were going at our table.  Chips were good, hot sauce was watered down and almost tasteless.  The check:  Upon the conclusion of our meal, the check was delivered.  There was an add'l drink on there (the extra Sprite from the earlier mix up) and upon us asking, they responded but we brought you the limeade.  Well, that was on there too!  Also, the mandatory gratuity was included b/c we were a party of 7.  Are you kidding me?  The owner is there, never comes over to apologize and then they charge us for everything and include gratuity?  I spoke with the server, told her that despite her best efforts, it was a misreable experience and that we were very disappointed having driven 30 minutes.  She apologized and said she had spoken to the owner and told her but that she didn't care.  Seriously?    I will NEVER waste my time here again and am flabbergasted that this place is still in business after 8 weeks.  It will not last given it's current state.  They were clearly understaffed and yet the owner continued to seat large parties despite the obvious breakdown in all aspects.   Do not waste your time going to this location.  This place needs a manager and obviously NOT the owner running the place.  She was rude (I saw her get into it with 2 other customers) and I saw 2 tables leave.  She obviously doesn't care about what the customers think and she avoided our table going so far as to hide in the kitchen until we left.   Shameful and awful.  This review would not have been written had she come out, apologized for the lack of service and bought us a round of drinks just to show that she was committed to making a bad situation better."}
{"text":"Guac is 'towering' and super yummy. I had the red beef tamale. Very good, large portion, definitely don't need to order anything else. And they have an option for sautéed veggies as a side which is a great alternative to other unwanted carbs. Black beans are great too!"}
{"text":"The best mexican I've ever had, hands down. I've been to all the hyped places; Z'Tejas, Chevy's, Gardunos, Macayos, Tia Rosas, Carlsbad Tavern, Blue Adobe, Arribas, Salty Senoria (horrible), Pink Taco (deplorable). The food here is as quality as I've had with mexican.   I find many mexican places give you little taste with a heavy supply of starch and cheese. Their Carnitas and Lamb Chop are slow roasted and bursting with flavor. Margarita and salsa selection leaves a little to be desired, but this place is a can't miss. Save room for dessert, because the Mexican chocolate cream pie is simply amazing.  Alright I'm cutting back to 4 stars, the plates are great, but the margaritas could be better, and the chips and salsa leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"Authentic flavors, modern twists.  Food quality was fantastic.  Tequila selection is incredible. The patio seating was fabulous.  Our server was helpful.  Really, nothing more you could ask for.  Will be a new regular spot."}
{"text":"what better way to end a perfect Spring training baseball day than with a marg, Mexican food and your girlfriends... the local in the group said this place would be crowded on a Sat night, so we weren't surprised with the wait time, but if a place is used to being crowded....they should have a better wait plan. if the bar is full (which it was for a bit), there is not much space to hang and wait, once we got to our table, our waitress spaced....got us water and then never came back. i liked the menu, as it spiced up some of the normal Mexican fare...like the shrimp chilaquiles with chipotle cream sauce that was great! the guac is good, but deceiving as it comes out in this huge mound served in a pestle...in actuality, there is a lot of lettuce on bottom then cup of guac. and my house margarita was more tangy mixer than tequila, kinda ick.  i think this place has potential and i might try it again if i could do it on a weeknight, but for now it just gets my average."}
{"text":"Food is great. Really really Great. Portion sizes are adequate. Prices are a little too high for the portion sizes. Last time we went their AC wasnt working well. Spoke to a friend who also went recently and the AC wasnt cooling during her visit either.     All in all, Ive been back a few times however, will try a few other Mexican joints in South Scottsdale before I go again."}
{"text":"First time here. This place was amazing!  Nice outdoor setting.  Colored lighting for a fun atmosphere.  I choose to sit at the high style bar tables.  Nice to be able to look straight into your waiters face.  Didn't get a chance to see inside the rest of the place.  My husband had a Margarita and traditional Chile Relleno and Chicken, cranberry and spice Relleno.  I had the appetizer mini taco combo.  Hibiscus, Chicken and pork with spices and raisin (I think).  It's a must go to place to eat whether you live there or just visiting.  Will go back if we get a chance."}
{"text":"Ok, tonight was our last trip to Los Sombreros.  We have gotten take out a few times since my last review and the order has been wrong each time but this is the last straw.    We ordered a bunch of items and when my husband went to pick it up he asked if the order was checked...\"yup, everything is in there\" he was told.  When he got home it was missing almost $20 worth of food.  He called quickly and we were informed that there is no manager there tonight - a Saturday night with no manager?  The guy was short with him on the call and offered to credit us for the missing items, how generous!  When my husband asked him to make sure the manager hears about this the guy hung up on him.   They had to credit us back in January but needed two calls to get that done and they kept the tax, a small but annoying detail.  Let's see if they actually even credit us for tonight's mistake.  The food is pretty good which is why I still give two stars but it doesn't make up for the experience.  They just can't seem to get it together with their staff."}
{"text":"This has become our go to Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. Non-Americanized delicious Mexican food.  Everything I've had at this restaurant to eat I've loved. The quesadillas are wonderful the tacos are outstanding. Keep an open mind not what you would expect at any Americaniced Mexican restaurant.  Food is delicious service is friendly and prompt owners are on site and friendly."}
{"text":"The menu has very unique selections. The service is spotty like a lot of local Mexican restaurants but certainly adequate. The drinks are over -priced but I do think the menu offers some nontraditional Mexican dishes that many people would enjoy. The skirt steak is solid. Used to go here when it was across the street in the shopping center but at least now it has more character."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the 10 course tasting menu....fabulous! We were so stuffed by the end of it we were sad we couldn't try anything on the regular menu. Great service and the VERY COLD beer was a wonderful addition to an already perfect meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful cantina dining experience.  Exceptional service and fantastic food!  Carnitas tacos were tender and flavorful, vegetables perfectly cooked and rice was out of this world.  This is a place that I will return to!"}
{"text":"Had a great time. My girlfriend has been here before. My first time. Some of the old servers are now the new owners. They are doing a great job. The food was yummy and the service was impeccable. Great job guys."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and while I find the service only average, the food is amazing!  I ordered seafood tacos the first time and chicken the second (both were wonderful, but really recommend trying the seafood), but from sampling off friends' plates, I feel confident in saying there is nothing bad on the menu.  Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Soooooooo good! Loved the environment, the bar was the bomb, the food fricken ahmazing!  BONUS, I found out it's the original restaurant from Jeff of Elotes in Sedona. Whuaaatttt? Elotes has been my favorite Mexican restaurant ever!! New Owners Kurt and Geoff have got it going on!!!"}
{"text":"Meh. The \"signature\" lamb shank was tough/burned and the adobo was incredibly sour. The server never inquired about the uneaten entree.  The $11 margarita was meh.  The crab and mango salad was good. Not sure the food and service live up to the $pendy prices."}
{"text":"Pleasant service, unpleasant dinner. Massive portions belied poorly prepared food. The chicken taco was dry, beef tacos tough, guacamole over salted. Even the margarita was poorly mixed. I would not recommend this place to anyone seeking an expensive Mexican meal."}
{"text":"the food far surpassed the service. my waitress seemed annoyed when i asked her questions about the food. saying over and over \"its so good\" to describe things"}
{"text":"Service ok, food a disappointment. Not much flavor in the chili rellano although the chicken enchilada was better."}
{"text":"Happy hour everyday from 3-6 with great deals! We have had all the quesadillas and they are the best! The watermelon salad is so refreshing especially in the hot summer months!"}
{"text":"My overall rating dipped a star from my last visit.  The service here sucks!  They appeared to be fully staffed during the dinner hour, yet it took more than five minutes for someone to acknowledge my presence at the wait stand.  Employees were milling around tending to more important stuff, I guess.  Not sure what ranks above a potential paying customer. When I was finally seated and attended to, it didn't get much better.  The waiter was curt and impatient.    The food wasn't bad.  I opted for a house margarita (no bueno/poorly made) and two of the appetizers.  I must say the appetizers were great. This restaurant offers a twist on what I consider traditional Mexical cuisine.  They do a nice job so the flavors aren't so outlandish and out of line with what you're expecting.  They also provide you with chips and salsa to start.  The chips were light, crispy and freshly made; however, the salsa left tons to be desired.  They brought two varieties out with the chips and I didn't care for either one.  Both lacked flavor.   Los Sombreros could really improve in my eyes if they acted like they gave a damn about their customers.  I didn't get that impression on either visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant is outstanding! I have been here more times then I can count. The margaritas are delicious (I get a strawberry blended margarita) as well as the food. My two suggestions would be to always get the guacamole for an appetizer and then the smoked chicken enchiladas for the entrée."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food in the valley.  For that matter, it is the best Mexican food we have had anywhere.  We have been loyal and frequent customers for many years and are thrilled to have a new North Scottsdale location.   The new location is convenient and the ambience is superb.  The wait staff was prompt and courteous.  The food is fantastic.  Gourmet Mexican.  The best!!  We are also looking forward to our \"Twelve Tamales of Christmas\" Gift Box which we will pick up for Christmas Eve.  Yummy."}
{"text":"I've been talked to go there for several weeks and I refused until yesterday. Being a Mexican food expert makes me pretty reluctant to go to Mexican restaurants outside Mexico. But oh well, I did it.  Let's start with the positive.   Great patio and dining room. A pretty cool door in the bathroom-although there's rust in the sink and it's not that clean. Service was just OK (there you go, the 2 stars right there).  What i didn't like:  1. Labeling. It's a pet peeve of mine when restaurants call food a name that it's not accurate. Tortilla soup is more a Caldo Xochitl (tortilla soup has a tomato base broth). Rompope has no tequila.  2. Food. Cuitlacoche crepes tasted good but they had an after taste of burned oil. Tortilla soup was lame and well, not a tortilla soup. Mole was thin. Chiles rellenos had like pound and a half or cheese. It was just offensive the amount of cheese stuffed in this things. Bean & cheese tacos (kids menu) were bad. Guacamole was packed with onions and serrano chile, too overwhelming (I belive it was serrano). Rompope was just alcohol with milk, it tasted ok, but nothing impressive.   The only dish I really liked was the chocolate cake. That was tasteful.   3. Price. The price is ridiculous, specially what you get for it.  Most likely, I won't go back.  The best (worst) part is that they rather not accept American Express. They try to push you to use something else. wow"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the very best Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale and possibly all of Phoenix. Portions are unbelievable, the food is remarkable and the prices are extremely reasonable. It has easily become my favorite place to enjoy Mexican cuisine in the Phoenix area and I look forward to every visit."}
{"text":"It gets even better.  The chile relleno covers the entire plate.  The chicken in crème spinach is their best and signature dish.  Cannot say enough for their attention to detail.  And their home made salsa is the best!!!  Great service too!"}
{"text":"The food is FABULOUS.  The service SUCKED.  Capital S SUCKED.  My friends and I had been dying to try this place.  We met last night, and started with a drink at the bar.  They had cocktails, and I had a glass of white sangria -- it was pretty good, not fantastic.  The bartender was really nice, and pretty darn cute too (this wasn't the Scottish guy -- which I was sort of hoping to see -- I'm a total sucker for the accent).  We ordered the guacamole, which is truly divine.  Chunky, with a good amount of cilantro.  It comes on a bed of cabbage and some a radishes.  My friends thought that was kind of weird, but I thought it was good!  The chips were good, and they came with these weird sort of pinwheel-y things.  I didn't care for them, but my friends liked them.  We decided to get a few things for dinner and just share them.  We moved from the bar to our table and ordered the seafood tacos.  They were spectacular!  The fish and shrimp were tender and delicious.  We all raved!  Next, we got the carnitas.  The pork was so delicious.  It had a lot of carmelized bits, which are of course my favorite part.  There was a bit of fat on it, which I had to pull off....  Blech.....  But it was so good, I didn't mind the fat removal.  They were served with black beans and rice or veggies and corn tortillas.  I would absolutely recommend this to anybody.    It was around this time that the service REALLY got annoying.  The server and bussers kept coming by to see what they could clear from the table.  Literally they came by THREE times in ten minutes.  And it's not as if there was a huge queue at the hostess stand, and there were a few open tables.  So why the pushiness?  Did they NOT want us to stay and order more drinks?  Apparently not.    My friend really wanted to try the green chile tamales.  So she ordered those, and they were good, but I was in no way WOWED.  After bringing those out, they came by again another two times to clear.  Finally we just gave in and told them to clear the table!  Fine ya bastards, take our plates!  Another point to make -- the food came out incredibly quickly -- which was nice at FIRST, but after the pushiness of the server and bussers, it just made us feel like they were trying to turn the tables and just get us out of there.  I will definitely come back because the food was delicious.  My friends and I all commented about how interesting their menu was -- there were many different things we all hoped to try in the future.  Maybe last night's pushiness was a fluke.  I hope the next time I don't feel so much pressure to leave!"}
{"text":"I could not agree more with Alicia B's review. I went here with my husband Saturday night, it is in our nieghboorhood and we had heard decent things. We waited about 10 minutes for a table, not because it was full or busy. The hostess looked a right at us, no acknowledgement and then she went on to what must have been more important business. Finally, a passing waiter sat us. The service continued to be inattentive and slow. Our cocktails were tasty, I had a pomegranire margarita and my husband has something with a kooky name, I think it mentioned a Donkey. We had the Queso with crab which was pretty good, the crab could have been tastier and the whole thing needed some spice. The chips and salsa, OK. I had the carnitas, after recommendation by our waitress. Not bad, but certainly not good and not worth $17. My Husband has the seafood crepes, they were OK, but lacking flavor. The food was not bland, but flat, just meh. This place would be a 3 star, but for the price, it is coming down to a 2 star.  The building and patio are really cool and set a good atmosphere, too bad the food and service don't follow suit.   On a side note I did get to overhear a great conversation by two guys visiting from out of town, probably in thier mid to late 40s. I guess last time they came here the women were way hotter. This time there are hot women, but they are not as common. They seemed to like the place, one of them remarked the only thing better than his food was getting laid earlier that day."}
{"text":"Good carnitas, guacamole, and margaritas. I loved dining on the patio.  Prices are a tad on the higher side than what I am used to paying for the average Mexican restaurant, but overall I give it a solid 4 stars.    Tip- you may want to make a reservation"}
{"text":"I went to Los Sombreros last night and was pretty excited to check it out since I live close and have heard great things about it.  OK...so we get there and there is no where to park..there is a lot behind the restaurant that I believe belongs to Pep Boys and has signs up saying you'll be towed if not a pep boys customer.....ugh...we took our chances since there was no where else to parking (we were thankfully not towed).  It was pretty crowded..but I was ok with that...especially since it was a Friday night. ...and then I got to meet the hostess.   Got up to her podium she looks straight at us and without saying anything like \"excuse me for a minute\" she turns her back to us and has a 5 minute conversation with a someone working there (which I would have been understanding about had she acknowledged I was standing there at least.  When her conversation is done  she asks how many, we say 4 (2 friends were meeting us and were seconds away).  When we ask about an estimate in time for the wait she says she won't \"worry about that\" until all of our party was here...I explained they were in the parking  lot..blah, blah....Her attitude was nasty and  giving me a poor first impression.  Red Sangria was Mmmmm, Queso fundido with chorizo was WOW, sea food tacos were just ok, chips and salsa were just ok....and all of it was a little over-priced!  My fav thing about this place was the ambiance...big patio outside with some fire pits going...a man playing mexican tunes on a guitar...and warm colors throughout.....Still I really don't think I will be returning.."}
{"text":"I'm in Phx this week to visit the male parental unit. I couldn't wait to get some good Mexican food in during my visit, because we all know what extremely limited selection there is on the East Coast. Upon Yelping it, I was surprised to see how low many of the Mexican places were rated in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area! I settled on this place out of convenience and it had the least fluctuation in ratings.   Now there were 4 of us vegetarians here, and I did not for a second think this would be an issue. Mexican food is probably one of the easiest to make \"vegetarian-ish\", and most places I have been to have several veggie options on the menu. Not so for this place!! The only veggie entree on the entire menu was chille relenos, and they were able to concoct cheese enchiladas and a 'veggie plate' (which we did not end up getting, why would we pay all that money for a plate of vegetables!?).   Between the 4 of us, we got a large order of guac, 2 cheese enchiladas, and a chille relenos. My dad and I each got Patron Silver magaritas too. Here's the breakdown:  Great: -The guac was superb and I would attribute one of the stars just to that. I love guac anyways though, so it's really difficult to rate poorly for me. -The enchiladas were also great and you could tell the tortillas were homemade - yum!!  Good: -Margaritas. Pretty good, and pretty strong (had only 1/2 of mine and could feel it!). Tasty marg mix. -Patio with heat lamps was a fun ambiance, although it looked a bit chaotic (too many chairs at our table, heat lamps scattered all over the place, etc). -Accoutrements such as black beans, rice, and veggies. Standard fare, decent taste.  Meh: -The chille relenos were bleh. Soggy in their sauce, and really really cheesy (like too much so. tasted rubbery.) -Salsa that came with the chips was not that good! That's usually one of my fave parts about Mexican restaurants is the fresh and delish salsa. Not so with this place!  Double Meh:  -Service!! Sheesh the place wasn't THAT busy it was a Tuesday night, but after our waitress took our order we didn't see her at all, even after we had already asked for more chips and salsa and my dad had asked for habenero salsa (he has taste bud issues in that he has none). It practially took my round-ish dad flying out of his seat and tackling the waitress in order to have her come by again just so we could *remind* her of what we had already asked for 10 minutes earlier! And we could tell when the food came out that it may have been sitting there for a bit; it was just meh warm not piping hot as it should have been.  -Price. I thought for this meal, $105 (incl tip) was a bit ridiculous, especially since the cheese enchiladas, while they were good, were just glorified quesadillas (which were $5.95 on the app menu).   Wouldn't go back here, but we did leave full (mainly due to chips/salsa/guac)."}
{"text":"Amazing place!  Great food, friendly staff, clean, awesome outside bar.  Not sure what else there is i should expect!   Both myself and wifey eat vegetarian and there were plenty of tasty options for us....plus the great drink selections.  I had the potato blackbean enchilada and it was to die for!  We were out of towners visiting from Los Angeles, what a great find!  Try it, you won't regret it.    Kurt"}
{"text":"Definitely a place to avoid.  Hopefully it is short lived.  Food actually used to be good, not any longer.  Prices are as other reviewers have noted, absurdly high.  Service is not good.  The salsa,,,bland.  And being the room is small and there were several business diners who have not the tact to keep their voices down, the place was deafening.  Guess one should take a clue as you walk in past dead and dying plants around the place that something has gone very wrong.  Hopefully, the next occupant will be observant of detail."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Northsight Blvd. Los Sombreros for the first time this month.   We indulged in their 10-course tasting menu for two ($75.00 for two people).  Our server, Maria was very good.   The courses were brought out at a reasonable pace. Not too rushed.   The chicken tortilla soup was excellent and was the first course.  Just spicy enough, plenty of corn, fried tortilla strips on top, great flavor.  We thought if all the courses were this good we were going to really enjoy ourselves.   The second course was a small hibiscus taco.  Unusual, sweet, but very good in a unique way.   The rest of the courses were either disappointing or very disappointing.   The courses had far too much sauce on them.  The sauce seemed to be the same on all the courses that had mole sauce in some way.   The smokey flavor of the chipotle was way overdone in the sauces that included it as an ingredient.  All we tasted was chipotle and nothing else.   Many of the courses included corn, and by the time we were done we were \"corned\" out for a while.   Also, the 10-course tasting for two is not specific in that some of the dishes you each get your own of, and others there is only one and you have to figure out a way to share it.  For example, one pork chop was served with mole sauce to me and the chicken dish was served to my husband.  So, I ate half the pork chop and my husband ate half the chicken and we switched plates.  We were not a fan of this.  Someone is not getting the best cut or portion of each dish and it starts to get cold in the process also.   The pork chop was not tender.  It was a thin cut pork chop and had it been a normal cut pork chop it may have been better. If you like chips and salsa you may also be disappointed.  The chips are very, very thin (and cold) and don't have a lot of flavor. The fish dish had far too many capers on top of it and the piece of trout was about 2\" X 2\".  The capers far overpowered the light delicate fish, especially with a piece that small. The second fish which they said was a snapper was smothered in a chipotle sauce which ruined the fish totally.  We did not eat it. Horrible combination of smoke and mushy fish. The corn cake soufle with mole sauce was very mushy and rather than make the corn cake soufle and put the mole sauce on top, it appeared they had baked some mole in the soufle and then put more mole on top.  I swear there was 1/3 cup of mole sauce on a 2\" X 2\" pice of corn cake soufle.  Neither my husband and I felt the soufle had set up enough. We know they should be light and delicate but this almost tasted undercooked. We found it odd that Maria took the plate, noticed we did not eat it, but did not ask if anything was wrong.   Two salsas are served, one medium heat and one spicy.  Both were thin and runny and ran off the chip.  There was not a lot of ingredients to the salsa so it was hard to get them to stay on the chip.  (not chunky but rather thin and runny) The Piloncillo ice cream was served in a bowl with zero garnish.  It tasked like a carmel or sugar cane ice cream.  Very lack luster.  Plain - nothing on top. I gave it a two stars because the server was good and we would go back on a cold day in Scottsdale for a bowl the corn chowder soup.  Considering how long their other Scottsdale location has been in business we expected better food."}
{"text":"I was going to Sidewalk Surfer across the road and had seen this Mexican restaurant before so to sooth my curiosity I stopped in for lunch.  Always on the lookout for Chile Rellenos made with Poblano chile I was extremely glad to find theirs were. The price seemed a bit high but where I'm from the only place that had Poblano chile Rellenos was only slightly lower.  I was very surprised and pleased when my order came and there were TWO Rellenos. (By the way the place I was referring to has gone out of business)  There were 3 kinds of hot sauce: mild, tomatillo, and habenero. I didn't know you got all 3 so I asked for the tomatillo and habenero and got 2 of tomatillo 1 habenero. Both were execellent!!!  The Rellenos were excellent! The server had subbed the \"chunky tomato\" sauce to the chipotle tomato sauce for me. Did I mention that the Rellenos were the best I've had?  It makes a big difference using a Poblano chile instead of a hatch or anihiem chile in my opinion. Sombreros off to Los Sombrero for doing so."}
{"text":"This would be five stars if I wasn't gnawed by no-seeums while seated inside near a window. But I love the wood fire smell from the parilla.  This re-purposed brick house is charming, despite the reluctance of the desert to really vacate the premises.  I had a delicious, dark green, tender poblano in white sauce.  It was filled with mixed white and dark meat chicken and queso.  Quak was chunked and distinctly spiced with lime on a too-tall bed of shredded lettuce.   Service is a little spacey, but definitely accommodating. Parking is really easy."}
{"text":"This was a tale of two visits. Both times I of course sat at the bar, but the first outshone the second.   My first visit was after I landed in Phoenix and needed some dinner. It was the first spot I saw when I hopped on the road from the hotel so I figured I'd give it a shot. Upon checking out the menu, the Tijuana donkey (instead of Moscow mule) jumped out at me. Turned out they were dangerously delicious. I wanted something light so I asked about the two seafood dishes. The bartender told me he doesn't do seafood. Undeterred I went for the snapper. It was just delicious.   Based on that experience, I decided to head back again later in the week. Unfortunately, it turned out to be like reconnecting with that hot girl you had a date with years ago - it didn't quite live up to that memory. The mahi dish was meh at best, and the tortilla soup was just ok as well, lacking flavor.   I'm really not sure what to make of the place. I'm going to split the difference and go with three stars."}
{"text":"The best mexican in Scottsdale. Delcious chips and salsa and guac. I had the duck enchiladas and washed it down with a strong Margarita. A must visit when you are in the area"}
{"text":"I tried Los Sombreros for lunch with a few coworkers last week, and we did not have a pleasant experience.  Some of the food was really good, some food not so great, and the service was possibly the worst I have ever received at any restaurant in my life.  First impressions on arrival where that the restaurant appeared to by very nice and clean.  I liked the atmosphere, but perhaps the very low number of patrons should have been an indicator to run.  As we reviewed the menu, we started to notice some things.  They charge for chips and salsa, and there is only one free refill of chips.  Also, at least on the lunch specials, we noticed that you are forced to choose between either rice or beans as a side.  We were shocked.  We had never seen this before at a Mexican restaurant, and this was our chance to run, but we decided to stay and try this place out.  As the waiter arrived to take our drink orders, we indicated that we would need separate checks.  He said that it's not possible to split our check.  Now, this was not our first visit to a restaurant, so we knew that it was possible to split a check.  We proceeded to challenge our waiter on this.  When we did, he said that he would have to open a separate table for each person in our lunch party and that our food would come out at all different times because of the busy lunch time rush.  Keep in mind that at this point two or three other tables were occupied in the entire restaurant.  We finally gave in and just went along with the single check policy.  When we received our food (all items from the lunch specials), we noticed that the portions were extremely small.  It was almost laughable.  Since we had to choose between rice or beans, we all chose beens.  Everyone agreed that the beens were not good at all.  It's amazing... I mean they figured our how to mess up refried beans.  I think everyone was disappointed by the quantity of food.  Especially for the price.  I must say that the enchilada (although only being one enchilada) tasted really good.  That was until I was about half way finished and I found a hair in it.  I was still hungry after only finishing half of my small portion, but I decided that was enough for me.  I notified my waiter that I found a hair in my food and that I was finished eating.  I asked  him to remove my plate.  A couple minutes later, a woman came back with my plate and questioned me about the location of the hair.  When I could no longer locate the hair, she insulted me by saying, \"Was it an invisible hair?\"  Someone at my table chimed in to tell her that they had seen it too, so she took the plate back to the kitchen.  When I thought that was all over, she brought my plate back a couple minutes later at asked me if the hair was from corn.  She then proceeded to show me a hair from a corn husk that was mixed in with the food and asked me if that was what I had seen.  It wasn't the same coarseness or color at all.  She finally went away and never came back, and fortunately they didn't charge us for that plate.  We had high hopes for Los Sombreros, but things just didn't pan out.  Although some of the food items were great, portions were low and prices were high.  Service was lacking entirely.  For anyone thinking about trying Los Sombreros, I would certainly recommend staying away.  For anyone at Los Sombreros that is reading this, It's not to late to change your ways.  Stop being so cheap with your portions and work on your service.  Even though we didn't like the portions, the beans, the hair, or paying for tortilla chips, we could have had a pleasant experience if the staff had handled things differently.  Your restaurant seems unorganized and the people there are unhappy and it trickled down and polluted our entire experience."}
{"text":"Still my favorite Mexican food in the valley. They have unique family dishes that you will not find in any typical Mexican restaurant. If you are looking for the basic burrito, enchilada, or chimichanga...do not go here!!! If you are looking for traditional regional flavors done right by the family that owns the place, then do come here and you will have some great food. I have been a fan since the first time I went there and will continue to visit when I am in the area. For all of you nay-sayers....wake up and enjoy some traditional Mexican food and get rid of those Taco Bell mentalities! Los Sombreros knows how to cook god food!!!"}
{"text":"This was soooo disappointing.  Service was terrible. We watched 3 parties walk out because they weren't getting any service.  The Mexican food was authentic, but our adult daughter commented that the vegetables looked like what she buys at Traders Joes, fresh out of a bag-and these tasted like it.  The staff pressures you to order appetizers.  If you order appetizers the chips and salsa are free but if you order 3 meals all over $20. each, plan on paying for the chips...it does state free when you order an appetizer on the menu, but seriously that is just silly!  Another Scottsdale business that won't and shouldn't make it!"}
{"text":"The servers here are super friendly and are great at recommending items from the menu and their likes and dislikes about a particular dish. I have eaten at this restaurant a few times and the food has been consistently fresh and excellent in taste and presentation. It is not your typical Mexican food. This place serves dishes that one would not find in Los Olivos or La Tolteca. I had the green and black bean corn tamales. They are phenomenal! The queso fundido dip is fabulous as well. I like how it is a small, quaint place. If you want to avoid the rush go around 4:30 pm. otherwise outside seating will be the next best bet aside from waiting for a table inside since the place holds around 35 people total."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Mexican food. Having been the Valley for five years now and trying multiple Mexican restaurants, this place is one of the best there is. Atmosphere is very quaint and nice, and great drink selections. Tried the smoked chicken enchiladas and they were amazing. Everyone check this place out."}
{"text":"Ordered take out, and asked specifically for no veggies, since I'm allergic to one of the main veggies they use. Pick-up due in 20 mins.  Arrived 25 mins later, order hadn't been done. They put the veggies in with both dishes, make it impossible to eat either (didn't realize until I got home.) The lamb was boiled and in a sauce that made it impossible to taste the meat - it was just chewy sauce. The mexican rice had next to no flavor, the salsa ordered came in two tiny side containers you'd get at Filibertos, and one of the two salsa types had next to no flavor - it was water, cilantro, and a couple of chunks of onion and tomato.   The guacamole was tasty, and the chips were fresh, but that is the only good thing I can say about this experience."}
{"text":"This is lovely place for really casual, yet higher end Mexican food. It is a small, tastefully appointed venue with mostly outside seating in a private, shaded patio. Food is exceptional, not your typical rice and beans fare.  The crab mango salad is gorgeous, fresh and just divine.  Wonderful quesos funditos to choose from too. We watched other dishes go by and wished we had two stomachs. It is NOT in the over touristy old town area, so make a point to get here. Dessert flan with special tequila on top was to die for.  We are fussy foodies, and this place met our expectations. Definitely returning to this find!"}
{"text":"This is more authentic Mexican food -- not the type that's smothered with cheddar cheese or the salsa that you're used to seeing in a jar.  Quesadillas are not the type that you would find at say, a Chili's -- two large flour tortillas with some cheese in the middle.  They're made of fresh masa and are stuffed with rajas, and are more akin to fried turnovers than your standard Americanized quesadilla.  Other than the quesadillas, we ordered the mole verde and seafood tacos, both of which were excellent.  The chips came with two types of salsa.  I was a huge fan of the chunkier spicier one.  Even the veggies were good -- not the standard onion and pepper mix, and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but definitely not worth the price.  Dinner for two with 1 drink each was over 60 bucks! For Mexican food! I had roasted pork with a chipotle sauce.  Nothing to write home about, and the sides of rice and beans were more of an afterthought.  The 2 stars in this review are for the pleasant atmosphere on the patio - that was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Really poor service keeps this place from being 4 or 5-stars because the food is really good.  We had seen that Los Sombreros was called one of the best Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale by several magazines, newspapers, etc, but we were skeptical of coming here because of the 3-star rating on yelp. When we dug into the ratings it seemed like there were a lot of 1-star ratings because of bad service. After having dinner here, we could definitely see why.  The joint wasn't even half-way full and the waitress was already telling us we should get our order in quickly because there were big parties there that would take a while to make the food for.  We placed our order, had to ask repeatedly for the guacamole we ordered so we could eat it with the chips. We also had trouble getting our waters refilled. After we finally got our food it was lukewarm temperature at best. We considered sending it back but didn't want to wait any longer. My brother also asked for jalapenos multiple times and we never got them.   The food was actually very good. I got the duck enchilada which was tasty and much more authentic than most Mexican food I had. My brother loved his salad with Oaxaca cheese, chicken and pumpkin seeds. My dad had a Lamb Adobo and the sauce was very tasty and not too rich. My mom loved her Hibiscus Enchilada.  We told our waitress that the food was cold at the end and she gave us a $20 gift card for the next time we come but it would expire in a month. This seemed a bit weak given that all of our food was cold.   Overall, I would like to give more than 3-stars because of the quality of the food but can't given how bad the service was. Please get a new manager and we will come back!"}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!  Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evening's change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.  I am not an expert on \"authentic\" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.    We chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinal's loss!  (Sad, I know, since they were off to a great start)....  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter, aka the bartender.  Phil (no need to blush if you read this) did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey!  My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar, no salt, heavy on the tequila preferences...and that was just to start!  Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand, check.  Now what to eat for dinner.    My friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano ($18.95) while I couldn't decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema (yumm) and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce -or- tinga Poblana sauce($18.95).  I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and, once again, my dinner friend had 'order envy'!!  That's not to say his Mole was par (or dare I say sub-par) because it wasn't - it actually has received many culinary awards being named \"Best Mole\" both locally and nationally, but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach, perfectly sautéed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is....AMAZZZZZZING!!!!  It's also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides (as we ordered), they also offer up tacos (3 at $10.95), various quesadillas (@ $5.95) and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole, salads and more!    Deciding I'd save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert.  Undecided, again, and so we trusted our gastronomy guide, Phil, to choose.  He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening, and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do!!!     Thank you, Phil and Los Sombreros, for the memorable dining experience.  The food was outstanding, margaritas made by Phil are the best, and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert.  Thank you for staying in the neighborhood, Azucena Tovar, and congrats on almost turning 20 years old."}
{"text":"Amazing food and Margaritas! You will not be let down, try the puerco en chipotle!"}
{"text":"It does not get any better than  this.  We had the chili relines that were the most amazing things I have ever eaten.  The quest dip melted in your mouth and you wanted to eat it with a spoon.  The salads were refreshing and flavorful.  the guac was a gift from the waiter and there as no room for desert.  Don't miss this gem."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a neighborhood gem.  The food is always good and authentic, and the service couldn't be better.  It's so nice to be appreciated--when we came in the hostess immediately recognized us and welcomed us back.  The food was incredible and the margueritas the best in the city.  Especially good are the tamales and the enchiladas.  My husband enjoyed the corn chowder and his three tacos.  Try the hibiscus tacos for something out of the ordinary!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Los Sombreros for the first time this past weekend. I loved it!  I had the Pollo con Espinacas which included 2 sides as well as tortillas. The flavor was amazing. The 2 others in my group raved about their entrees as well - the seafood tacos & Hibiscus enchiladas. We were very pleased with our server and will definitely be dining there again. We can't wait to sit on the patio - great ambiance."}
{"text":"Never sure what your going to get at a Mexican place, but this was awesome!  Smoked chicken enchilada were amazing as was their guacamole and margaritas!  Btw, they had two pages of margarita choices!"}
{"text":"When will restaurant owners learn that great service is as important, perhaps more important, than great food?  Just left Los Sombreros North ... first visit .... was looking for a late workday lunch.   OK food, high prices, no chips (extra charge), no water,  no ice tea refill.   They weren't even busy.  $14.05 plus $2.00 tip for me.   Still hungry ..... think I will go to Costco for a $1.60 hot dog + soda.   Never again."}
{"text":"Wow. Fantastic food! I'm someone with some pretty serious food allergies and our server went back to the kitchen to find out what on the menu I could safely eat, came back with recommendations, and I was delighted with what I ordered. Great service, fantastic food, and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really good. Some vegetarian dishes are excellent and portions are large. Specials for meat eaters on Taco Tuesday.  Great service and great margaritas (Cadillac).  We in Hawaii beg for this kind of cuisine from south of the border.  With every bite.  Ole."}
{"text":"This is a very cute place - small inside dining area, but comfortable.  You could tell the food was fresh and well prepared - however, it was fairly bland.  We had the steak tacos and green corn tamales - and there just was not much flavor.   I admit I like my food more on the spicy side, but even my husband who will tolerate much more mild food was disappointed in the lack of flavor. The people were very nice - service was great..... just need to work on the food a bit!"}
{"text":"We came to Arizona for vacation and wanted to try some authentic TexMex style food. We found this place on Open Table and am so glad we ate here!! They have two types of salsa and serve a mountain of guacamole!! We ordered chicken tamales and Puerco Chipotle!! These dishes were full of flavor and freshness! We overheard the owner say they just bought it and they are doing a great job! Too bad we don't live here...simply a must try if you are in this area. Chocolate pie is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Man the new ownership really shows. Been here twice since the reopening and love it. My favorite was Taco Tuesday! $2 Tecate and $3 special tacos till close...We had the Shrimp and Goat Cheese, Salmon and Mango Pico & the can't go wrong al Pastor.  Service was great and again, food was great. If you haven't been or haven't been in a while you will have a good time for sure.   Almost forgot, regular menu - ribeye tacos are BOMB!!"}
{"text":"I've been twice to the restaurant both for Happy Hour, and have enjoyed pretty every item on the HHr menu, from the empanadas, tacos, corned-souffle, fig and panela salad, etc.  The tacos and empanadas fillings were unique with the chiccaron, picadillo, huailcacoche, amongst the choice of chicken and potato, but we wanted to venture something different from the average.   The tamarind margarita was smooth sweet and soury, just as I like it.  We received free chips and salsa-maybe this was different from the past.    The service and prices were right on.  We will continue to return as I'm bored with other types of Tex-Mex menus and since this menu provides a fresh and well-prepared fare. ."}
{"text":"Los Sombreros Mexican Food is one of the best restaurants I have come across in central Arizona.  This is the original location, the other is further north.  The food is very much like what I have eaten in Mexico City, D.F. down through Guatemala and Honduras - so it is not your typical Sonoran style Mexican food so often served in Phoenix.  I had the potato tacos - really small, but absolutely totally filling and tasty.  Their salsas are different than anything I have tried at other restaurants - very pleasant taste, and not too hot.  Everything is made 100% from scratch, so that makes the higher prices worth it, in my opinion.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Good guacamole, nice atmosphere and staff.    I'm still in search of the perfect carne asada though."}
{"text":"I had my first experience here over the weekend and the new and improved Los Sombreros DID NOT DISAPPOINT! We had a pretty large group and not one time was anyone in need of anything! I had the Pollo Con Espinacas! It was delicious...perfect about of spice and the sauce was excellent! The chips and (two kinds) of salsa were also great!  We sat outside and with the space heaters on, everyone was comfortable! Great spot and we can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Mole sauce was amazing! Chicken was a little dry, but searously the mole sauce was good enough to eat with a spoon. Skip the fundido.  The waiter could not explain some of the items on the menu, which was funny. The hicima tostado was great!  so was the mango crab salad."}
{"text":"Awesome food all around. I had the smoked chicken enchiladas. Good chips and salsa. Great grilled veggies.  This is our second trip to spring training and second time to Los Sombreros. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here during Phoenix Restaurant week.  We had rapid and friendly service.    We had 3 courses and my girlfriend had a Margarita.  Everything had the gooey deliciousness that I expect from Mexican food.   The Chile Colorado had a lot of spice, so come ready for a lot of powerful flavor!"}
{"text":"Excellent, fantastic, authentic Mexican food. Gourmet and unique, best in town!"}
{"text":"A couple weeks ahead of a trip to Scottsdale I tried to make reservations at several places in Old Town. No. Sorry. Nope. Nothing.  Oh well.  Then my sister told me about Los Sombreros. It is about a mile south of Old Town so doesn't draw the big tourist crowds. Their loss is my gain as this place is very good.  I made a reservation through Open Table a week ahead and we arrived a little after 6:00 p.m. on Friday night (May 11). My wife and I were promptly seated on the patio (which has plenty of shade and misters), and then greeted by our server. The service was good and friendly all evening.  The chips are good, the salsa is OK (could use a bit more kick), the margaritas are very good, and the food is very good. My wife had chicken, and I had ribeye tacos with a side of green beans & bacon.  Despite being south of Old Town there was a good crowd. Everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best margarita of my life (no joke), and the place is cute, but the food is just \"ok\" and overly priced in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food was good. Not what you'd normally find in a traditional Mexican restaurant.  The guacamole was excellent. Great selection of tequila. Chips were fresh, green sauce was great."}
{"text":"18% guaranteed gratuity. The sour cream tasted old and smelled weird. Everything needed more salt. Server kept forgetting what drinks we originally ordered. Barely got checked on. Dropped check and didn't come back for quite a long time. Food subpar. Service subpar. Yolanda is not a very good server. She needed to get it together."}
{"text":"Food poisoning, stay away!!  I had the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce and completely regretted it that evening and the entire next day.   We should've known better since the menus handed to us had an entire meal left on them. Completely unsanitary and disgusting.   We went to get our money back which they refunded us only half the bill. When we told them what I ordered, their response was \"Yeah, the mole sauce is bad sometimes.\" Umm, are you kidding me?!  Only a matter of days before the Health Department shuts this place down."}
{"text":"My husband was having some Mexican cravings one night, and as we always try to do to try a new place, we decided to try Los Sombreros which is only a few miles from home. As we pulled in the parking lot, we were surprised how packed the lot is so we thought this was a good choice. At the reception area, we got greeted and seated right away. Service is quite good as glasses with water and menu were handed as we take our seats. A basket of freshly made chips with mild salsa was served as we take time finding a good meal to choose. As we scan the two-page menu, we found the selection to be minimal and somewhat overpriced with only a few items costing to at least less than $10 and the rest within the range of $10-20. The chips and salsa were good enough that we asked for another serving without knowing that this will be charged, it was actually on the menu that per refill costs. Not a good thing I guess. We decided on Simmered pork in a pumpkinseed tomatillo mole sauce, presentation is nice but nothing really special as we take bites of it. It's an entree that comes with choices of refried beans, black beans, rice or vegetables and tortilla. The only thing that made my husband happy with the meal was the hot salsa that really made him sweat like he has never sweat before from eating hot salsa!   Overall, the experience didn't leave us happy and will not try to come back here again though I would rate the ambiance and decor high as it is inviting and homey."}
{"text":"Update November 2017:  This restaurant has new owners that are doing a great job! Sometimes places go downhill when the original owners sell. This is not the case with Los Sombreros. The food is better, and the original menu is intact. They have added a few new things, too. They've actually lowered prices on some items a little! They've done some redecorating inside. Now that the weather is nice the outside patio is lovely. Great restaurant for the food of Central Mexico! If you haven't been for awhile, try it again.       We have been fans of Los Sombreros at the original Scottsdlae Rd location for years. We renewed our friendship this past weekend. We had been going to the newer Northsight Rd location because it is closer to our house. Unfortunately, it has closed and we sort of forgot about the original. We are very happy we stopped in to have dinner. The food was as good and original as it has always been. We've always liked the patio with it's fluffy trees better. We reconnected with our friends on the loyal staff. My favorite dish is the hibiscus enchiladas and my husband had rellenos. Both are prepared in the style of Central Mexico. This is a little different from the usual border, Tex-Mex style of most local places.  If you've been going to the Northsight location and found it closed, drive a little further south and go to the original. It is worth a trip!"}
{"text":"We have been fans of the original location on Scottsdale Rd for years. We were very pleased when they opened a North Scottsdale location and are open for lunch. The owner rotates the kitchen staff between locations so the food quality is consistent. The ingredients are top notch and fresh. The food is not the typical Tex-Mex that we're all used to in Arizona. This food is from    central Mexico and delicious. Some of my favorites are the hibiscus tacos and enchiladas. All of the pork dishes are great. The adobo sauce is superb. It is a special treat to find huitlacochi on a menu. The chocolate tamale is a wonderful desert. Other reviews mentioned that you had to choose between rice or beans and that chips/salsa were charged. I don't think that is true. We had the choice of black beans with veggies or refried beans with rice. Chips and salsa were complimentary. The owner was present on a Sunday evening, so that shows she really cares. Prices are reasonable. It's great, give the North location of Los Sombreros a try!"}
{"text":"Went to Sombrero, food was good it was ok, nothing special.  Although the service was good, nice atmosphere.    I definately prefer \"Richardsons Cusine of New Mexico\".  Unquestionally the finest southwest food in the valley.  The rellenios are exceptional, same with the enchiladas.  The Beans the best.  Margaritas are outstanding.  Try it http://richardsonsnm.com/  . Dont get me wrong I will go back to Sombrero"}
{"text":"I have been eager to try Los Sombreros for some time. Last night (Cinco de Mayo) was my first visit. I expected it would be busy and that it would take a while to be served.   It wasn't busy. The staff, however, was running around like mad, accomplishing virtually nothing. Tables were left uncleared throughout the restaurant. Glasses were stacked up at one end of the bar. Soon after I sat at the bar, more people started coming in. They had to wait at the door a good five minutes before anyone showed them to a table. The bartender was friendly, took my order quickly, and I did eventually get my drink. The drinks there are freshly made, which is great, but it's very labor intensive and time consuming. The man was behind the bar alone trying to take care of the entire restaurant's orders. On Cinco de Mayo!  Also known as Gringo's Night out for Mexican Food and Margaritas!  Very poorly managed. If a Mexican establishment ever needs extra staff,  it's on Cinco de Mayo. Then I ordered a glass of wine. They couldn't find the bottle. Fine. Ordered another. They couldn't find the bottle. So I asked him to pour me what did he have available. Luckily, it was a very nice Pinot noir.   Then I approached the hostess stand and asked to be placed on the list for a table on their patio. They didn't actually have a hostess but the waitstaff who came up to help was very nice and said she'd just come get me when one came available.   A good 20 minutes later she came back to me and asked if I wanted to sit inside. Uncleared, EMPTY tables were on the patio. No, thank you. By that time I was trying to get the bartender's attention to cash me out. Very disappointed because I really wanted to try the menu, which looked amazing. I just couldn't  wait any longer.   I will go back and try again.  I have to wonder if a call to Bar Rescue might help the owners and management figure out that customer service really does matter.  We will see."}
{"text":"Tasty but pretty pricey. It's the same concept of Chipotle; choose a burrito, salad, etc and add your choice of meat and toppings. Basically lettuce and cheese. Tortillas and meat were very good but they loaded my taco with lettuce, taking up the whole thing. Side of rice and beans, which are mediocre. $13 for 2 small tacos and a small drink. Employees at McDonald's are friendlier than here too..."}
{"text":"Loved the food and service, they have options for vegetarians. Got the hibiscus tacos, huitlacoche crepes and potato goat cheese enchilada. All three were pretty good."}
{"text":"I am disappointed that my fellow Yelpers average a 3.5 stars because I loved this place.  The atmosphere is cozy, and the food was outstanding.  I had the Carnitas (real smoked flavor with a crunchy crust) and my mother had the Pollo con Espinacas (with a chipotle cream sauce to die for!).  The sangria was YUMMY as were the salsas.  OK, OK, the service could have been better.  The server was fairly attentive, though I do not think he smiled at us once.  He must not have hurt my feelings too badly though because I am definitely going to return!"}
{"text":"In Scottsdale escaping Chicago cold. After a few nights of hotel food we wanted casual Mexican. This is the place: family run, small, authentic food. Crazy cute waiter who dared my husband to try their hottest salsa. It was a mouth burner...Avoid house margaritas, go for better choice. Queso fundido with chorizo, onion, black beans: yum. Tacos flavorful and right sized. Outdoor patio. Loved this place."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!  But don't take my word for it, try going on a weekend, or better yet a weekday, or even better...in the middle of summer, it's still packed.  Why?  Because the food has tons of flavor, the Marg's and Cerveza are tasty and ice cold and above all, I can repeat the prior words over and over for the past 7 years that I've been going here!  BP"}
{"text":"Food is always amazing!!! Best Mexican restaurant I've eaten at service is nice but a little slow I keep going back because of the food!! :) they have only one bar which is outside in the summer time the drinks are warm... Like I said before the food is killer though so all that can get put behind."}
{"text":"We ate inside. We only had to wait a couple of minutes at around 6. The service was very good and attentive. The food also was very good. We had the chips and guacamole and corn bread souffle with mole sauce to start. For main course we had chicken fajita with mole sauce with a side of refried beans and vegetables. I was very satisfied and would come back here again."}
{"text":"Los Sombreros is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. The food is always just perfect. The prices are extremely reasonable. I modeled my own guacamole recipe after theirs, it's that good. Try the specials of the day, they're always great.   The service has been a little hit & miss for me. Most of the time they're fine. There's this one woman who is extremely unfriendly. I think she just doesn't like me :-) But ya know, with food & ambiance like this, it doesn't bother me if I occasionally end up with a cranky server!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. We found it on Opentable.com. The presentation was excellent and the authenticity and flavor was in par with many of SoCals better Mexican restaurants. I had the crab meat enchilada, and my wife had Baja chicken tacos. Both entrees were favorable, not greasy and just filling enough. We will return to explore the other interesting goodies on There menu!"}
{"text":"Los Sombreros serves the Mexican delicacy Huitlacoche (Corn Smut in English...I know which language I prefer) which is pretty cool and something everyone should get the chance to try. The place is really cute so a meal out on the patio feels a little like a short trip over the border. The menu doesn't have a lot of options for vegetarians (me) but I still really enjoyed my meal & would come back, that's how much I like this place. My boyfriend & I had:  - Queso Fundido with Rajas: Delicious - good real cheese mixed with a lot of peppers & onions. I liked that there was some salsa (or a lot of cooking liquid from the peppers) mixed in with the cheese so it was a lighter fundido than just full on cheese. - Guacamole: Love their guac. It's really chunky & really fresh. - Huitlacoche Crepas: Such an interesting dish & totally unlike what I've had at other Mexican restaurants. The flavor of Huitlacoche is hard to describe - it's savory, a little like mushrooms, has a creamy texture. The flavor combination of the dish was very sweet & savory - savory huitlacoche with sweet pomegranate sauce and seeds with tart blue cheese, all wrapped in a soft crepe.  - Carnitas: My boyfriend ordered this and said the meat was really good. The serving size is enough for 2 meals. The corn tortillas that came with it were really good and fresh. The mexican rice and refried beans that came with it were probably not vegetarian and were just average.  I noticed in the kitchen they cook over a wood-burning stove, which seemed rather authentic and must make their food that much better. The bar is outside & looks like a beach bar, adding to the fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here for an early dinner. My group of three was one of two tables in the entire restaurant. First it was happy our and we attempted to order drinks from the happy hour menu only to be informed that we could only get the happy hour prices at the bar and we would have to say in there to receive happy hour pricing. After some further inquiry the waitress said she would allow us to order from the happy hour menu. We got chips, salsa and guacamole for an appetizer and it was mediocre at best. The tamales were good but not worth the $79 tab we incurred with an appetizer 2 drinks on happy hour and three entrées."}
{"text":"Visited Sunday afternoon after a round of golf. Dishes were stacked up everywhere and it took 10 minutes to get a beer.  Another couple that came in the same time as us walked out. Soft tacos were tiny and lacking flavor. Salsa was also lacking flavor and served in a chipped bowl. Refried beans were homemade and the best thing about the experience."}
{"text":"I thought the food was very good! The one thing that I noticed is that when ordering the large guacamole, 1/3 of it is lettuce on the bottom. I know a lot of places do this, but this is a higher end type of Hispanic food establishment, so I though this would be factored into the price of the food item. Overall, the food was very good and the service was above par."}
{"text":"I was told there was no spicy salsa in the Phoenix area. I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant and the salsa. The jalapeño margarita was perfect. The dishes were unique and full of flavor. The staff was warm and friendly with a down to earth touch."}
{"text":"I came in and it was in mid day so it was completely empty.  The server was very nice and attentive.  It was a fantastic quite spot to sit down and hide out, but the food wasn't what I expected.  I honestly didn't really understand the menu and in my experience that either means the food is amazing, or just ok... It's definitely a more gourmet Mexican spot.  They have a huge tequila section I might be back for, but not the food."}
{"text":"It had been many years since we had been to Los Sombreros, as we usually end up at Frank and Lupes's if we are this close to Old Town. Now, the first issue is the style of the food: some people do not consider ANY kind of Mexican food to be \"gourmet\" or worth any combo plate being more than $8.95.I grew up on Mexican food, and it's changed to include other areas of Mexico - the seafood of the Yucatan, the European influence of Oaxaca. It's not \"fusion\"....it's all Mexico, but most of us have had limited exposure to what Mexican food can really do! We arrived early on a Saturday and settled in on the patio - prettier than I remember and furnished nicely. We were immediately welcomed and escorted to a table. They could really use a guitarist on nice evenings. We ordered the Huitlacoche Crepas after I read the reviews here on Yelp. They were in-cred-i-ble with the earthiness of the mushroom-like fungus (sorry, I couldn't come up with a better word), the sweetness of the corn, and the compatible contrast of the cheese and a drizzle of pomagranet sauce. I don't know why a previous reviewer posted regarding the crepes being too sweet, as the sauce was not overly plentiful, and I would not have liked the dish to be swimming in the sweet sauce either. My husband had the carnitas which were wonderfully lean and smoky. However, when he tasted my Smoked Chicken Enchiladas, he absolutely rolled his eyes in ecstasy. Normally, I might have avoided a Tomatillo sauce, as it can be too bright and citrus-y, but this was just a blend of flavors that made me utter continual \"Mmmmmmmm's\" with every bite, and although I could have finished the plate, I left just enough to enjoy for a small lunch the next day. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!! With drinks (3), appetizer, 2 Entrees, tip - the bill was about $100, and worth it. We will be back soon. 2nd review - April, 2012  - I have removed a star. The hostess was rude, seating on the front patio is horrendous.....noise, the smell of the street, and the table in the corner sits at such a slant that you have to hold on to your drink. We introduced new Scottsdale residents to the restaurant that night, and they wished we had taken them back to Frank and Lupe's. So, Los Sombreros needs to prioritize consistency  - which probably isn't going to happen in such a small space"}
{"text":"Mediocre... Is the best way to describe my experience with los sombreros.  We have been anxious to try this place for a long time.  It had pretty good reviews and a friend of our recommended it for a late night happy hour.    To begin our waiter was a snob, he acted like we were lucky to have him, and at one point he actually rolled his eyes at us... seriously.   The guacamole looked fantastic coming out of the kitchen, so we started with that.  It was good, but it and the chips needed salt and there was none on the table.   The menu was not vegetarian friendly unless I wanted to order an appetizer salad.  They had a special on the board called \"Mushroom Quesadillas\", so I asked the server what was in them... trying to make sure it had no meat.  He said basically mushrooms and cheese.  So I ordered those.  What I got was  essentially a mushroom and cheese tamale deep fried, No tortilla! It was okay, but I would never have ordered it if I knew what it was... which was why I asked.   Getting anything out of our server was like pulling teeth.   The only reason I gave this place a 3 instead of a 2 was the chocolate cream pie dessert.  I think we may try it again for a reverse happy hour if someone invited us, but the prices were a little high for the food quality and service."}
{"text":"I was thrilled that a potentially great mexican restaurant moved in near me.  Just wished it turned out to be more thrilling.  Had problems with service, completely inflexible.  Kitchen managed to muck up a basic of quesadilla order.  Server was incredulous that we might want that fixed.  And she questioned what a quesadilla should be, tried to take the kids menu from my 5 year old boy so she could read & verify WHILE he was coloring it with crayons.  Couldn't she just get herself  another menu?  They really need better servers.  And it was pretty expensive for a lunch time meal that was really just mediocre."}
{"text":"Ok here is the thing, I went back another time and it was good.   About a month later we came late with our roomie. It was bar service only since it was late.   The bartender a middle aged over weight red haired guy went to get our chips..   I watched him walk over to the chips and grab handfuls of chips with his bare hands. HE IS THE BARTENDER HANDLEING MONEY AND HE WAS JUST HOLDING A DIRTY RAG.  I asked him for a new batch that was \"hand picked\" he said it was all bare hand touched.   I told him that was fine for the food preparers that dont handle fecal, infectious disease money!!  He acted like I was retard, I didnt eat anything after I saw this but we did have a few bites and the food was not good.  It wasnt aweful but it wasnt good as before, AT ALL!  Get it together over there   more like 2 and a half  P.S. If the owners read this, he needs to be schooled. I wish I knew his name, he may have had a mustache?"}
{"text":"Ok...so I am not a big Mexican food fan generally.  I love the idea of it; the big margaritas, always a fun time, but the greasy food usually leaves me not feeling too good after. This is not the case at Los Sombreros!!!   The atmosphere is sooooo great -- an old house thats been redone with a great porch and fantastic big outdoor bar.  For food I got the mango crab salad which was amazing!!! Light and refreshing, but incredible flavor.  We also had an awesome watermelon salad and my date had a pork dish that was really good too.  His portion was so big but not overly creasy or heavy...just too much.  Mine was the perfect light meal even though the waitress said it was small; thus they probably are accustomed to big portions.   This is not your typical mexican fare.  Everything was very fresh and not too greasy.  The sangria was good and the margaritas were pretty good as well, although not fantastic.  Over all a winner!! Sit at the covered outdoor bar if you can and watch the monsoons come in.  A great date night out!"}
{"text":"I had two experiences with Los Sombreros .... One dining and one trying to get a reservation for a large party. My future in-laws were trying to decide on a place to make a reservation for about 20 people for dinner two nights before my fiance's and mine wedding.  They sent us on a mission to try out Old Tortilla Factory and Carlsbad Tavern.  We knew the atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern, knew it wasn't what they were looking for, and found Los Sombreros on yelp.  They had good reviews and what looked like a very cozy atmosphere on the patio so we gave it a try.  We tried both restaurants and could not express how much better Los Sombreros was, the atmosphere, the food, the service .... hands down, we wanted them to book the dinner reservation here.  Well that's where my five-star review is a one-star review and I felt the experience trying to book the reservation outweighed the dinner service so they now have a one-star review.  My in-laws called them, spoke to Miriam and requested to reserve the patio for the night in question (mind you, this was about 6 weeks out so we were giving them plenty of time .... they said the more time we could give them, the better it was for them).  Miriam took the reservation but needed a credit card to hold the spot.  My in-laws thought that was weird but gave it to them anyway.  There were a few questions that she couldn't answer so requested their contact information to have her manager Jesus call them back the next day. No one ever called them back so two nights later they called again and reached Umberto.  They explained what had happened and that no one called them back and requested to speak to a manager. Umberto asked how he could help so my in-laws thought they were speaking to a manager and proceeded to tell him that they spoke to Miriam but because no one had ever called them back, they wanted to cancel the reservation.  When my in-laws said they were going to cancel the reservation, Umberto said \"well we already have your credit card number\".  My in-laws had to cancel their credit card number because they were afraid they would be charged for the reservation of 20 people anyway! How can you ever recommend a restaurant that you're trying to give them a party of 20 people on a normally not too busy night (Thursday night) and they still threaten to charge your credit card because they have the number? We will never go back and I definitely can't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place didn't stand out on it's own but I tried it due to the proximity to my hotel and the overall positive yelp reviews and I am happy that I did.  I went early and solo so I sat at the bar.  I didn't experience any of the service issues that are pervasive in other reviews.  The bartender was a bit less sophisticated that I would have expected.  Given the extensive tequila menu, I asked for a recommendation for his best margarita.  Despite me telling him that I am not a fan of sweet and a more traditionalist, he suggested a coconut margarita.  When he described the ingredients, I passed on his recommendation and went with one from the menu (which was delicious).  As a vegetarian, I also asked for the bartender's food recommendation.  He was very candid and knowledgeable about both the menu and other diners' preferences.  At his recommendation, I ordered the hibiscus enchilada and I am so glad that I did!  It looked beautiful and tasted better - a nice blend of tangy and creamy and very substantial.  The black beans served with it were good, if not a bit too salty.  Fresh steamed veggies and rice added a nice compliment.  I found the prices reasonable for the quality and amount of food.  They do offer a limited happy hour menu that had many options at discounted prices.  I don't mind paying for quality food but the one thing that rubbed me the wrong way was charging for chips and salsa, which were just okay - typical offerings at any other Mexican restaurant.  The price was modest but it was a strange staple to charge for."}
{"text":"Omg.  Please save your money and stay away from this place.  Waited forty five minutes before we got our food. Ate two basket of chips because we waited soooooo long.  Everyone around us was waiting. We paid $87 for three people and we had no alcohol . This place is expensive and it sucks."}
{"text":"We met a friend here for dinner last month to celebrate the holidays.  It had been years since we visited and after this delicious dinner, we were left wondering why it took us to long to make a repeat visit.  Nice atmosphere, great service and tasty food.  I highly recommend the potato and goat cheese enchiladas with rice and sauteed vegetables...perfect dinner combination!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary thought this place was very nice but the service was horrible server kept forgetting that we were there the food was not that great  since they kept forgetting to bring all of it at the same time definitely not returning"}
{"text":"My sister and I were so thrilled to stumble upon this place while we were visiting the Scottsdale area. Jeff was amazing - the best service I've had in a long time. He went above and beyond to please my nieces, both of whom are picky eaters. The food was wonderful and beautifully presented and the atmosphere was really fun. We are only in town for a couple of days but we may be back again before we leave!"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and love their food and margaritas.  Their chips and salsa and of course the guacamole are extremely good.  If i can remember correctly they do charge for chips.  I also really love their jicama and mandarin salad with a chile lime dressing and their Enchiladas de pollo."}
{"text":"The 10 course tasting can feed 3-6 people depending on your appetite. Every course was amazing !!! From start to finish. Very authentic flavors."}
{"text":"Authentic, flavorful, inventive... delicious!!!!  Food quality is 5 stars. Service was wonderful too. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great food great price. We ate here 10 years ago and now that we moved back to Scottsdale we wanted to try it again. It's under new ownership now. We started with margaritas and they were great, believe me we are fussy. They aren't too sweet and they put booze in them. We got the guacamole, nice and chunky. I had seafood tacos and the others had the steak and enchilada. We loved our meals. The seafood was flavorful and not fried. We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal- As far as food goes, this place deserves 5 stars, its inventive, fresh, Mexican food and always amazing. The location is great and I would love to frequent it. However, the owner Azucena Tovar always comes off as a little ambivalent about her clientel, and I just can't get over it. We eat out a lot. My expectation and hope is an evening with great company, food, and service. Great company I can handle, great food Los Sombreros has covered...but the service makes me wince. The owner is the first person to greet you at the door and she is abrasive and has been rude (kinda sets the tone, it's her place after all). Not once, not twice, but several times. I try and support businesses that value and appreciate their clients, especially in this financial climate. So my compromise is take-out. We only (rarely) order take-out and on the condition my husband picks it up so I dont have to be reminded why we no longer eat there. Christmas tamales are to die for."}
{"text":"I have lived within walking distance for 3+ years, and should have eaten here long ago! I took my dad and child in for an early dinner. We had the guac (best I have ever had and I have eaten a lot of guac), tortilla soup and green chili tamales. My dad had a beer and I had a house margarita. All the food was so flavorful! The ambiance was great too, super authentic and looks like you are in a little Mexican house. I found my new favorite neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Los Sombreros has a charming atmosphere and unique, high quality food cooked and served by a friendly Mexican staff. The restaurant is in an old brick house with a nice patio filled with lights and trees. It was quiet there for a Saturday night, which is a shame considering Salty Senorita and the other fake Mexican places down the street in Old Town are making more money selling guacamole squeezed out of a plastic bag. Los Sombreros costs a few dollars more than maybe it should, but the portions were large, fresh and served with lovely presentation. I had enchiladas with hibiscus, which tastes like a sweet jam. I recommend the food and the ambiance, just wish more people would support their family owned business!"}
{"text":"Celebrating a family event,  Rosie our  waitress was very attentive to everything that we need for a very large family  Celebration, the food was delicious,  not to mention the  Margaritas are the best.... I would recommend it to all.."}
{"text":"The three things I liked about Los Sombreros were their Carnitas (slow cooked tenderness that melts in your mouth), a drink called the Tijuana Donkey (tequila and ginger beer), and the quaint atmosphere which made me feel relaxed (unlike some other Scottsdale restaurants)."}
{"text":"It was good but not great especially given the prices,  I had the carnetas and I have better for much less then what I was charged here.  The rest of my family thought the food was good but not worth the price charged.  Did not have the margaritas. The guacamole I have to say was among the best I have ever had.  Did not like the salsa.  Service was so-so. Next time I want Mexican I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I stopped here on my way to Carefree,  AZ. It was a lovely day to dine outside in their patio area. The food was also very good. I had the enchiladas de la plaza. The amount of food you get is more than enough. They also bring out chips with salsa before your meal."}
{"text":"This is an updated review since the new ownership took over a week ago, and it's a night and day difference. The atmosphere was electric, service was spectacular, and food was on point. We are thrilled that this neighborhood gem is back and better than ever!"}
{"text":"We have gone here for years. Food tonight was very poor. Service was good. Environment very old and dated. Unfortunately went when it was still light. Server cleaned our table, but it still was sticky. Food: \"signature guacamole\" was very small and \"blah\". Beans tasted as if they were right out of the can, rice was very old and totally cold! Very sad! It used to be very good to excellent."}
{"text":"When I review a restaurant, I start with the food and work down (service, decor, etc. come AFTER food when making my review.)  The food here is OFF THE CHARTS.  The staff was friendly, and the decor was nice with outdoor seating available.    I will be returning here whenever I am in Phoenix area...heck, if I am in New Mexico I might have to make it happen."}
{"text":"Terrific tasting mexican food with great service.  My wife and I ate there on Superbowl sunday around 3:30. We had the guacamole appetizer a bowl of posole and the Carnitas dinner. The guac was plentiful and delicious and came with plenty of tasty chips. We each sampled the posole and the Carnitas and both agreed they were excellent. Our waiter was also outstanding and even allowed us to taste a few of their draft beers. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone as it is clearly a cut above the rest. I also thought their prices were very reasonable for all the food we received."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio at the south location, the staff were very friendly helpful, I loved salmon with vegetables and beans, they were tasty and very clean. I also love the lamb adobo and the Mexican chocolate pie was a revelation."}
{"text":"Tried it. Was hopeful that it would be good since its so close to our house. Has potential to be so much more if they just expand the menu.  On a positive, service was great."}
{"text":"I wasn't very pleased with the menu choices, and the flavors were either too much or too little of \"something\" .... but I must say, the service was stellar."}
{"text":"Bar was dirty and messy bar tender had no idea how to make a vodka martini  Food was good but maybe should not have sat at the bar counter not cleaned had salt and dirt/dust everywhere I know I should have asked her to wipe it down. It seems common knowledge to do so before customers sit down I feel bad saying it was so disheveled but I feel people should know"}
{"text":"Very tasty Southern Mexican food! Had the seafood tacos, rice and beans. No sour cream. Salsa is very good and made from scratch! This place should have more than 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Great place, friendly staff, great patio. The best part was that the staff was knowledgeable and helpful regarding food allergies and what to avoid on menus for gluten and dairy sensitivities, as our family has severe ones. The good news is none of us got sick. Yay!!"}
{"text":"if you want the real deal mexican this is the place... i have never heard of it until i sat next to a lady from mexico city on a plane... right when i landed i went and i fell in love... the food is great and not your tex mex burro and fijatas... a must to check out!!!"}
{"text":"I purchased a coupon, this was my first time there and I went for lunch with a friend who had also never been.  It is a very nice atmosphere and more upscale than I was expecting.  We were taken to tall tables just off the bar.  I only saw one other couple in there and they were in another room with lots of windows.  The bar area is a bit dark but very nice. Our waiter brought us their drink menu and dinner menu.  Since I'd just been on their website I knew they had a lunch menu with $9.95 specials.  Even though we were there at 12:30 pm we had to specifically ask for their lunch menu.  This was red-flag #1.  My friend wanted one of those special margaritas whereas I asked for \"just a plane old margarita.\"  The waiter said \"so you want the 'house' margarita'\" and walked away.  Both margaritas were very good, my friend was particularly pleased with his.  Mine was a little fancy for my taste.  He ordered the Chicken Enchilada and really liked it.  I ordered Chile Relleno, and while it was prepared very well, it wasn't like any Chile Relleno I'd ever had before.  It had a sweet taste to it and was very rich.  While I believe many would really enjoy the way they prepared, I wouldn't order it again.  I'm much more of a plane-Jane sort of guy.  When the bill came we were charged for two of the special margaritas my friend had ordered ($10/each).  We asked about it and the waiter said \"that's just the way it comes up on the register; they're both the same price so it doesn't matter.\"  I wanted to know how a plane old margarita could be the same price as a \"special\" margarita and he explained that he'd brought me a \"house\" margarita, not a \"well\" margarita.  I guess a \"well\" margarita was what I thought my vocabulary was asking for but somehow things got confused in the translation.  This was red-flag #2. My friend will most definitely go back and take his wife.  He knows margaritas and prides himself in making them himself and immediately knew theirs were made with fresh lemons.  The waiter confirmed this.  While I wouldn't avoid this place, and even though they have very good food, drinks, and atmosphere, I'm the sort of person that is put-off by multiple red-flags.  Red-flags in this instance translate to \"not total honesty.\""}
{"text":"I want to like this place more than I do. It is 5 minutes from my house and such a great space, with an adorable patio. But other than those perks, there is nothing really impressive about it. I went once for a few months ago, right after receiving a mailer announcing new management. Nothing stood out then, but I decided to give it another try since they added brunch and sent a buy-one-get-one-free offer. Had a decent margarita and chips and salsa. Salsa is fine, chips are thin and crispy and seem like they might be made in-house but if they are, they should be served warm. I had the huevos rancheros with carnitas, served with roasted small potatoes. It looked so tasty but was bland and uninteresting, even once I doused some Cholula on it. We split the Mexican French toast. The different sauces drizzled on it (chocolate, caramel and pomegranate) blend together and the texture is really moist, more like bread pudding than French toast. The fresh whipped cream was a nice touch. Given how much more I like similar places - Barrio Café, Barrio Queen, Gallo Blanco - I do not think I would pick this place again."}
{"text":"I have to say I was super excited for this to open by my office as I love the old-town location. Arrived and were told to seat our selves...weird. Although there were only 4 other tables there at lunch time the two servers seemed to struggle.  Literally 5 tables around us had not been cleared and stayed that way the whole time we were there. Although the checks got picked up and tips got checked. Service was extremely slow, I can understand if a bus boy called off and it was busy. That was not the case it was very slow and only 3 other tables two servers should be all over that. Anyway glad I only brought my mother here not clients. I won't be returning to this location with the 50 other restaurants in the area for lunch that work hard for their lunch business in this commercial area. Food was good but the service made it a bad experience."}
{"text":"Great vibe, fascinating menu, delightful flavors, nice presentations - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I visited Los Sombreros with family in December.  We entered the strikingly small restaurant through a charming patio adjacent to the parking lot.  We were coldly received as we encountered three employees during our walk from the entrance, past the kitchen and bar to our table as not one of them made eye contact, let alone cracked a smile.  Our server was polite yet I felt a bit rushed to both order and eat.  I ordered limeade to drink and saw noted on the menu that one refill is included.  Although I sat with an empty glass for the latter portion of my meal, the server never attempted to provide my refill.  Also, when one member of our party was finished eating, she cleared his plate from the table and proceeded to also remove items that others were still using.  We all agreed that the food was enjoyable, although I would have preferred it to be warmer in temperature.  Finally, I was especially dissatisfied to learn that we were charged automatic gratuity for four adults and 1 child.  After experiencing the icy, hurried service, tightly cramped dining area and expensive prices, the imposition of the unearned auto gratuity was the final straw.  Mouth-wateringly delicious Mexican food served for reasonable prices in a warm environment is too easy to come by to return to Los Sombreros in the near future."}
{"text":"Nasty food and even worse drinks. We have better Mexican in New Jersey. The guacamole and patio were the only good things about this place. This is a tourist trap. Do not go here! They do not accept American Express!!!"}
{"text":"From the minute we walked in to this restaurant, we loved everything thing about it! Best Mexican food we've had in years. This place is authentic, very reasonably priced, and the service is outstanding. All of our meals were flavorful and filling. Our new favorite place, hands down."}
{"text":"Los Sombreros is genuine Mexican dining. I spent two summers living in Mexico, enjoyed family meals. Los Sombreros brings back all those memories with its authentic Mexican seasonings, sauces, and my favorite, Mexican cheeses. I am quite picky on Mexican restaurants, I confess to a rare taco/enchilada/rice/bean lunch combo Tex/ Mex style.Those restaurants are exactly what Los Sombreros is not. It is unique and my only choice for true, flavorful dining. Favorite on the menu-hard to say- I love the lamb adobo, the chile relleno, and there are always the tacos. The difficult choice is go with a favorite or venture out with something new. Margaritas-good.   Service-never had a problem. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My first impression was not great because the red cushions on the chairs were pretty dirty.   I ordered 3 tacos $10.95 seafood, fish & shrimp.   It was really wonderful, a great light lunch.  The ingredient were very fresh and flavorful.  My spouse had Crab & mango salad $11.95 which is served with honey-lime vinaigrette.  It was a very attractive presentation and very tasty.  He would highly recommend it.  He also enjoyed a margarita.  They don't have a happy hour, which is to bad."}
{"text":"We ventured up Scottsdale Road on Monday night because my inlaws wanted to take us out for dinner and they wanted Mexican. The sign for the restaurant out front is not that big, so definitely pay attention. The patio is really cute, but we opted to sit inside. Inside is small and cozy with exposed brick. I felt instantly at home.  My mother-in-law and I had the House Special margaritas which we both liked, although I have to say that the margaritas my mother-in-law makes at home are way better. For appetizer, we tried the queso fundido with crab which we all loved. Nice pieces of lump crabmeat and a nice manageable size for an appetizer. For dinner, I had the chicken tacos which were delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of it in the tacos. Even though it's listed as an appetizer, it was more than enough food for me for dinner especially after eating the queso fundido. My mother-in-law had the goat cheese and blue cheese crepes with pomegranate sauce; I snagged a bite...delicious! My father-in-law had the seafood tacos which he really liked (I didn't get to sample them). My husband had the crab enchiladas which I also snagged a bite of...they were good and the tomato chipotle sauce gave the dish a nice kick. We did however both taste a bit of shell which was unfortunate.  Our server was really nice and paid just the right amount of attention to us. I didn't get a chance to see the final bill since my father-in-law was paying, but the prices were very reasonable considering the amount of food you received. I think the most expensive entree I saw was about $20 which includes two sides. Definitely a place we will return to especially when it's nice out to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"The place in the Valley for upscale Mexican food!   The carnitas are exceptional and my wife regularly demands the chilaquiles.  Save room for dessert, as the flan and chocolate cream pie (made with Mexican drinking chocolate and cinnamon) are fantastic, both served with homemade whipped cream.  If your looking for upscale French-inspired Mexican, this place can't be beat!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.  Los Sombreros is as authentic as it gets when it comes to Mexican food. From the quesadillas to the chile rellenos these dishes are the best I've had.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Their pork pozole sopa is really good. I had no appetite because of sickness but I still almost finished it. The corns in it really add to the texture. Tortilla soup was a bit bland with its chicken noodle soup like taste. I would come back to try other food here"}
{"text":"Happy to report I love Los Sombreros! I cannot wait to go back again . We had a great dinner sitting under the heaters outside on the patio, which was very quaint. Our drinks arrived quickly as well as our Guacamole and chips.  And by the way why are they first place I have seen that has thought of a tequila / coconut margarita type drink. Love it!  We had chicken with mole  , which was a great portion size and the black beans were a perfect side accompaniment   Like I  said can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"I've been to Los Sombreros a few times and really enjoy the al fresco dining on their cozy patio. This is a great date night restaurant. I stay away from the indoor dining area because it tends to be a bit claustrophobic for me.   Anything with Carnitas ($18.95) is fabulous but the price is pretty hefty in my opinion. The service is usually pretty decent. I've never had a problem with parking like some other yelpers have mentioned. There is a parking lot and also some street parking.  If this place was closer to mi casa I would be a regular at this place."}
{"text":"The Los Sombreros 10 Course Tasting Menu ($50. for TWO) is PHENOMENAL and is something you shouldn't miss out on if you are thinking of trying flavors of Central Mexico as the special will end sometime call or check website. I was told they are extending the special past August to promote the new menu and new restaurant they are opening.  You get. Chips and two Fresh Salsas.  Two cups Pozole Soup Two Hibiscus Taquitos Fig & Panela Cheese Salad Shrimp & Papaya Salad Salmon with Mango Salsa Trout with Almonds in Lemon Butter & Capers Chile Rellenos with Beef Picadillo Pechuga Rellena (Stuffed Chicken Breast in Chipotle Tomato Sauce) Pork Loin with Tamarind Mole House Made Piloncillo Ice Cream  Everything had delicious flavors.  I never had Hibiscus Taquitos before and they were a stand out. A little sweet and cheesy and tangy they were delicious.  The Chile Relleno stuffed with Beef were very unlike any other I had before being much lighter and MUCH tastier than any other I ever had. I liked that they weren't a fried battered kind like you get at most places and only had just the right touch of cheese on them.  The four entrees were all delicious but a few were over cooked but very ACCEPTABLE and that is the only reason I didn't up this place to five stars but I was five stars happy.  The house made Ice cream was very fresh tasting and the most creamy ice cream I remember trying in a while.  This place is far above average and is very good but it's a small place and many tables inside are high tops.  ***UPDATE****the chef and ownership has changed since my visit******    4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"The ten courses for two special is PHENOMENAL and just might be as good as it gets for Mexican Cuisine in this area. You can't help being delighted with all the bountiful flavorful tasty plates that give you the feeling you were on a tour along Central Mexico. Everything  we tried was delicious and our dining companions were also thrilled and impressed with the well crafted food. (This now is a new favorite of theirs too.) Many other great Mexican cuisine can be found around town but what's here at Los Sombreros it's a finer dining experience with a very comfortable attractive dining room and shaded patio and very attentive service.   I thought a few things to go wrong since this was their first weekend open and the multi course menu requires above average service but to my surprise things went well like clockwork.  For $75. the menu per couple went like this.  Chips and salsa (2) Corn Chowder Soups (2) Crispy Hibiscus Tacos Fig and Panela Cheese Salad Crab and Mango Salad Snapper and Corn in Chipotle Balsamic honey sauce Trout and Cauliflower in lemon butter caper sauce Chicken Breast stuffed with goat cheese, huitlacohe in chipotle tomato sauce Chile Rellenos Pork Chop with tamarind mole House Made Ice Cream  You should plan the ten course event to take over two hours to enjoy."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch, the restaurant was empty. We waited for 10 minutes for a cook to wonder out and see us and ask us what we wanted. Then we were sat in the very back corner of the EMPTY restaurant. Waited 30 minutes, then the waiter came out. The food was not Mexican food. The food tasted like it was made in a drunken stupor by a culinary drop out who visited Tijuana for 1 day and now thinks they can cook Mexican."}
{"text":"Well we came prepared for a great meal. Knowing the owner was associated with the owner of Elote Cafe, a restaurant we love in Sedona we came in with a hungry stomach and high expectations, only to be pretty disappointed. The salsa was okay, it was served in a chipped bowl which is not very professional. The guacamole was actually very good, the best part of the meal. I got the tacos and my husband got the chile relleno. While he enjoyed them, they were still mediocre and so were my tacos, at least For the price. They were not very good. I expected more freshness and spice, and they were very bland.   Service was okay. Got what we needed but we didn't have a knowledgable server who was able to describe dishes and make recommendations, he merely took the order and delivered the food.   I honestly wouldn't go back, not for the price and the quality."}
{"text":"While I heard they have other locations, this is the very first time we went to this (new) location on Northsight Blvd. Amazing food.  I struggled with the menu because it is so different from Mexican restaurants. I don't remember what the name of it was but it was shredded pork with a chipoltle sauce with corn tortillas. FABULOUS! Service was good and the place was very busy. I am looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Stay away. Salsa is bland and under seasoned, portions are tiny and expensive, rice OR beans (not both), chips and salsa cost extra and include only one refill on chips. If you want to get nickel and dimed and leave disappointed, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Authentic.  Check out the back patio and bar rather than the interior restaurant."}
{"text":"I do love restaurants that are in converted houses, don't ask me why.  The patio is great because in the winter they have heaters and on the weekends a guy sitting outside playing guitar and singing in Spanish, making for great ambiance.   But this is tough because I've been to this place and gotten 5 star service and meal, and then I've gone and gotten 2 star service and meals.  So I've settled for in between.   As for the menu they do have excellent, authentic mole which is hard to come by.  I personally adore the lamb dish  which is fall off the bone delicious as well as the rib-eye if you are looking for a nice protein.  If you are more in the mood for something in a tortilla their shrimp and fish tacos or seafood enchiladas are both stuffed with fresh seafood and dressed with homemade sauces.  They serve healthful sides like black beans, brown rice and fresh veggies.  To end the night I highly recommend the chocolate pie which has a toasted almond crust and creamy, chocolate mouse filling.  On a side note you can buy tamales in the winter months full of fun flavors, like chocolate and pineapple."}
{"text":"Due diligence pays off as a continued exploration of the menu uncovers many flavors indigenous to Central Mexico that we typically don't encounter here. Most items won't have the heavy cheeses and sauces that cover up inferior dishes from other spots.  The more I eat here the more I miss the time I spent in Queretero, Mexico."}
{"text":"This was a great find. Los Sombreros has excellent service and tasty food. They are also gluten free friendly. Los Sombreros has a welcoming ambience. I really liked how they offer veggies as a side dish."}
{"text":"First Impressions: Slow service, and seemingly inattentive waiting staff, always busy (in that \"will they remember I am sitting here?\" kinda way).  The patio is nice to sit at, but that isn't enough to keep me coming back. Maybe I would be more patient on another day, but today I had my five and six year old sons in tow. Don't the wait staff know what a chore it is to keep children seated and entertained while hungry?  There is a special place in hell for restaurateurs that make parents endure this trauma...  As I waited for food. I was getting more and more pissed, and I broke out my mobile yelp to draft a scathing review. BUT, then my food came out.  And damned if I wasn't pleasantly surprised.  All the ingredients were super fresh and cooked to perfection (no wilted veggies or overcooked/dry chicken here).  I've been here a few times and never remember being to so impressed.  Not that they were bad before, just not real memorable.  But this meal was _much_ better than the previous occasions. Did they get new kitchen staff? Are my taste buds off today? Or have I just been ordering the wrong entrees all along? Whatever the case--my food today was delicious (I ordered the chicken enchiladas BTW).    SO... I have mixed feelings about this place.  Service did pick up during the end of the night, but at first it was abysmal.  Food was delicious, but previous visits didn't impress.  Drinks were passable.  Chips and salsa, also passable but not great.   Ambiance, very nice.    Overall, I think I will be back.  Maybe it was an off day for service, or maybe it was an exceptional day for the cook.  Who knows.  But they've earned another try."}
{"text":"I'll give it a 2star for ONLY the look of the place... Seat yourself at a table and play the waiting game. Went to this restaurant with my family and service was crap, one lady(maybe a host or owner idk she didn't bother introduce herself) came by asked if we're okay, we asked for a high chair and she said she'd get us one(she never came back to our table). The waiter came by got our drinks order and he was not so helpful, I think he was the only waiter for the restaurant because he was running around each table. Anyways, I wanted order chicken enchiladas but it has spicy sauce on top so I asked if the cook could put the sauce on the side and his response was \"No\" so I had to rethink another entrée. We asked for quesadilla for kids and if they could add chicken in it he said \"no\". The salsa was watery and not good.  After waiting and waiting and waiting we decided to get up and leave. So far the only thing that went good was our soda drinks! My guess is that everything is pre-made and that's why they couldn't put anything on side or add.  I would never recommend this restaurant. I forgot to mention OVERPRICED!!! We ended up at the Mexican food place directly across from them lol got better food excellent service and more reasonable price."}
{"text":"The new owners are great!! Really bringing this place back!! They were able to accommodate our large party for a special event. Food was amazing so much flavor, \"Steve's margarita\" was how a margarita should be. We'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Great, and unique flavors.  Started with chorizo and black bean fundido.  This came with chips and 2 unique salsas.  We really enjoyed all!  Had the seafood crepes after that per the waitress's recommendation/  Be sure to have the limeade.  It is outstanding."}
{"text":"We made reservations for a party of 9 at 6:30 pm on a Thursday. We were prompt and on time. Our table was ready! We were happy  We ordered a couple of the homemade guacamole appetizers, which is absolutely the best! Several of us ordered beers and margaritas, the evening was just beautiful, sitting outside.   We placed our orders, the meals arrived...all at once! Impressive for a small, privately owned restaurant! I had the Pollo Con Espinacas and will return to have it again. The sauce was magnificent!  We had Flan, which is, in my humble opinion, the best anywhere in Arizona. We also had Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie....be prepared to be amazed if you order this...and it's more than enough to share with your friends and loved ones.   Geoff came to our table to check on us, he's such a great guy and one of the owners. We left happy, with full tummies and smiles on our faces. Excellent Evening!"}
{"text":"Truly a gem in Scottsdale. Flavors that can't be found in many Mexican food dishes. Service is the best. Looking for the the best patio happy hour, you've found it at Los Sombreros. Molé is the best in AZ."}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by a bartender. I went to the restroom and upon my return found my husband still waiting to be seated.  After a few minutes together, we asked the bartender if someone was going to seat us or if we should seat ourselves.  He replied \"oops, sorry about that, I can seat you\".  We should have left right then and there because for the rest of the evening we were treated as though we were invisible. . Our waiter was disinterested in us, and we waited over 45 minutes to get our food on an evening when the restaurant was not full.  The food was OK., we did enjoy the wine selection.   My husband and I are accustomed to high-end restaurants and thoroughly enjoy mom and pop restaurants. We would not spend money here again."}
{"text":"While I am partial to good hole-in-wall Mexican food, I was pleased to find a nice alternative to tacos and chimichangas.  We sat on the patio, which is a great patio btw, to enjoy the beautiful weather before it's gone.  We ordered (yes, ordered) chips and salsa and guacamole.  They serve two salsas, both green.  The spicier one had the most flavor.  The chunky one was a little bland to me.  I had crab enchiladas in a chipotle sauce.  I asked the server if the chipotle was firey hot since I don't care for that.  She stated the crema it's mixed in cancels out the heat.  Not so, it still had a nice kick.  If you really can't tolerate spicy food, I wouldn't order anything with chipotle, however.  I like that sauteed veggies are an option in addition to the standard beans and rice.  They were fresh and still crisp. My husband had the lamb adobo.  He complained the amount of lamb (it was still on the bone) was insufficient given the bowl of adobo sauce and the price.  We are not exactly light eaters mind you.  While some other Yelpers have noted service issues, we had a fantastic server..pleasant, efficient, attentive without being intrusive.  My complaints.  Offering chips and salsa, yet charging.  Why is it that a $10/plate restaurant offers them complimentary, yet this restaurant charges when their meals are nearly $20?  To me, this is like expecting your customers to pay for their bread basket.  Desserts were lacking.  My husband had the flan.  I'm not a fan, so I didn't try it, but he wasn't overly impressed.  I had the chocolate tamale.  For some reason, I expected it to be a sweet tamale.  Instead, it was just chocolate cake in a husk.  Not bad, but not heavenly either, evidenced by the fact I didn't finish it, a rarity in the dessert world for me.  Other offerings were ice cream and chocolate cream pie.  I'm sure we'll return since it's so close to us, but I'll bring my own chips and a bottle of Pace next time!"}
{"text":"This ain't Macayo's folks. It ain't Los Dos Molinos, either.  If your only exposure to Mexican food is Tex-Mex, AZ-Mex, or NM-Mex, you will probably find yourself dazed and confused. This is more in line with what you will find in the interior of Mexico.  It's also delicious. Try the duck enchiladas covered in a smoky mole sauce. The seafood, either as enchiladas or just as a fish entree is also excellent. The flavors of the ingredients really come through and the food isn't heavy.  Service is friendly and they have a great patio. Margaritas are top-notch: even the well margarita uses decent tequila."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was horrible. I made a reservation for 16 people and the tables they set apart for us were way too close to the wall to the point that it was uncomfortable to some of my guests. We had to move the table ourselves. The server kept forgetting our waters. My little cousin (5 year old) was thirsty and we had to tell the server three times. My cousin's margarita tasted weird and when she asked for a new one, the server gave her an attitude. The server barely stopped by our table. By the time we were ready to pay, the server was eating his dinner a few tables down from us and it took him a while to come get our check. No wonder the place was empty. The gratuity was really high and they don't split checks. Paying was a huge hassle as we had to calculate how much we each had to pay. Most places that don't split checks, will figure out how much goes on each card if you tell them what you ordered. I will not be coming back and do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Grilled Ribeye Soft Tacos are amazing!  So happy to hear you're back and can hardly wait to come in. We've missed this place. The food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing drinks, and amazing service. I'm not entirely sure why this only has 3.5 stars. It is by far one of the best Mexican restaurants I've eaten at in some time."}
{"text":"Some co-workers and I were looking for some good Mexican near our hotel while on a business trip in Scottsdale. Yelp led us here. The chips and salsa were very good, and bottomless. The quesadillas were very good and the meal quite filling. The place has nice unique decor too, which is always a bonus. On the odd side, they have a strict policy against separate checks. You can pay one check with 4 different credit cards, but you can't get 4 checks instead. Whatever, it didn't cause any problems."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Los Sombreros. The staff, food, and drinks are consistently wonderful. The new owners are present, friendly, and truly love their staff, restaurant, and customers. We continue to return over and over!"}
{"text":"Coming into the Phoenix area for a family party, we stopped off at Los Sombreros for some margaritas and Mexican on an otherwise cooler night in the valley of the sun.   I was told they are very picky about reservations and, if your party isn't complete, no table. So our 6pm reservation was now in jeopardy because the last two of us (me and my fiance) were running late due to issues on the ramp at Sky Harbor airport, obviously out of our control. But they still didn't want to seat us...  additionally, I overhead on the way to the place that they would only \"try\" to do their best to accommodate our party, making it sound like they were booked up solid until closing....typical Scottsdale always trying to look more happening and hot than it really is.   Moving on, we somehow \"lucked out\" (go figure) and had a table no problem, so all the stress caused by the hostess was unnecessary and, in my opinion, pretty unprofessional, especially since the restaurant was empty by 8pm, again, typical Scottsdale.   The menu was brief, and I almost had to double check I wasn't looking at an appetizer. Most of the items are typical Mexican staples with a bit of a Southwestern American twist to them making the food a hit or miss if you ask me, some items were good, some were not. But that's really anywhere I suppose.   The one thing that stood out for me was the Guac. I will say this was flat out delicious but Guac is pretty had to screw up.   The margaritas in my opinion reminded me of something you'd get more at Chilis, a little too sweet for my liking but definitely drinkable.   The fundidto appetizer we ordered left the table empty twice and well I'm not really one to combine seafood and cheese, this blend seemed to have a harmony with others and I'd recommend it to a first timer, +1 if you request to add spinach.   Finally moving on to the entrees, different contraptions from the kitchen filled our table with vibrant colors, assortments and sizes.   I myself ordered what I was told is sort of the house specialty ,call it carnitas mixed in a chipotle sauce with veggies type of deal. While it was tasteful and was more than enough to get the job done for me, the flavor of the pork wasn't really there, at, all.   I browsed over a couple other reviews and noted the same complaint but hey that's what hot sauce is for I guess.   Overall it's an alternative to the chains hoarding Scottsdale road."}
{"text":"Thank you, it's good to be back!    I hadn't been to LS in a few years since I don't find myself in that part of town often so I was excited to pick up the Groupon and head back.  After a  not-so-hot Mexican food experience with a friend I wanted to show him what I like.  And now he likes!  We got there around 8:30pm on a Sat nite and it was still packed inside so we sat outside since it felt reasonable with the misters.  We each had a Cadillac margarita, eh, was on the plain side.  The chips and salsa were tasty, one roasted tomatillo and the other a chunky tomato with peppers.  Neither overly hot but nice roasted flavors and spices, tasted freshly made.  We decided to have an appetizer dinner and went with the crab & mango salad, fish tacos and corn souffle with mole.  The salad was surprisingly filling and had nice, fresh flavors, the fish tacos were really tasty - just enough spice on the fish with a slice of radish, avocado and a little shot of crema.  The corn souffle was our favorite, we thought it was a nice idea.  The mole was nicely developed and went well with the corn souffle, although I think it would've been even better with some peppers in the souffle to add a little more heat against the sweet of the corn and mole.  Yes LS is on the pricey and more gourmet side.  If you're interested in nice flavors and interesting plays with Mexican food with quality ingredients then you'd probably like it.  If you're looking to consume mass quantities of cheesy-Mex and not so much savor it then its not for you.  The menu isn't overloaded, but it all looks pretty well planned and sounds tasty to me!"}
{"text":"i haven't eaten there since becoming a veggie, but before, man, some good eatin. i don't exactly remember what we ordered, but they have delicious drinks and they have such tasty dippings for the chips. moderately priced for the middle class foodie."}
{"text":"Being native Arizonans, we have had every conceivable combination of tortilla, meat, cheese, lettuce, etc.  There is comfort in the same ol' chips and salsa starter followed by some sort of tortilla combination bent, folded, or fried served with a bit of lowered expectations.  And then there is Los Sombreros....  How have we lived for years just down the street from this unbelievable gem?  Layered, nuanced flavors in everything - including an incredible smoky tomatillo salsa that hints of mesquite in the fireplace.  I had a carnitas dish that almost had a barbecue sweetness layered over chipotle smokiness.  Layers.  If you like your food \"brown, hot and plenty of it,\" then Los Sombreros might not be for you.  If you want a taste of Mexico's best family traditions then make your way to Los Sombreros.  We will be hard pressed to return to standard Mexican fare after tasting this food."}
{"text":"If there was a negative star I would hit it at least 20 times  We went for lunch @ 2oo  ock - i usually go for happy hour a appetizer....but this time I went with my whole family (six)  we all decided to just get a \"quick appetizer\" -  three tacos each and two sides of guacamole.  The tacos tortilla was smaller than my hand and with only four pieces of meat...the guacamolee was filledwith cabage on thebottom to make it look big and tons of onions....I was forced to scoop  out one huge spoon fulled of guacamole because a flie sat on top of it.  We were there for 20 min ....remember we were in a rush...but when we got the bill $135.00   they include a twenty dollar tip !!! Cannot belief I paide $135.00 for 18 tacos....and a two soda drinks...  NEVER GOING BACK....at night my feet were huge guess the meat was toooo salty....."}
{"text":"Los Sombreros did an amazing job on our wedding night catering.  Not only was the food delicious but they also provided our favorite signature margarita: the Steve-o-rita!  It was so incredible that our guests could not get enough and the Los crew was kind enough to serve one last round to a few guests, even after they had packed up for night. This team of talented caterers & servers went the extra mile to find out what was most important to us that night and made the experience flawless for us.  I highly recommend Los Sombreros for any special event or party you might be planning!"}
{"text":"I am also disappointed at the poor reviews of Los Sombreros. I have never been unhappy with the food or atmosphere here. Sometimes the service is a little slow on the first contact, but once you order the food comes pretty quickly--and it's good! I've been here 5 or 6 times and always leave with leftovers--large portions in general are served! The margaritas are so-so in my opinion, but they have a huge tequila selection and lots of mescal. The best things on the menu? The lamb is delicious but better for you spice lovers; carnitas are superb; yummy chunky guacamole (although this could probably come in a bigger bowl); huitlacoche crepas; and lots of their specials (i had really good duck tacos once! unfortunately i have yet to see it on the specials again). I took my parents, including my dad who needs perfect service, here and they both enjoyed it.   Pros: outdoor seating           delicious food  Mediocre: margaritas  Cons: wait till first service"}
{"text":"The one and only star is for the bartender. Mike. He was amazing. Friendly and knowledgable. That said, I've never had mexican food I didn't like. I knew as soon as I tasted the chips and salsa- terrible - that I was in for bad food. Guacamole needed salt. Chips needed salt. Rice was the worst I've ever had. Chili Relleno was almost not edible. Service was HORRIBLE - didn't take our order until AFTER appetizers were served. It was a large party- but still. Some liked it. Said the mole was great. My husband had the salmon. It was ok. But for me- awful."}
{"text":"I would recommend you try Los Sombreros.  While many other restaurants in the area have so so food that is overpriced, Los Sombreros is high quality, delicious food at the right price.   Portions were right on.   I like the location because it's just outside the craziness and traffic of old town Scottsdale, but it only takes a minute to drive there from Old Town (parking was a cinch).   I went for lunch: service was snappy, the tacos were amazing, and it didn't break the bank.  They have available patio seating in a fun atmosphere.   PS- you HAVE TO try the mountain of guacamole with your chips. Very fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"I love the downtown Scottsdale location and was ecstatic to see one open closer to where I live.  The new place still feels very new, has plenty of parking and lots of room.  The food, just as with the downtown location, is superb.  I love Tex-Mex but it's a real treat to get an authentic Mexican meal like what Los Sombreros serves.  The guacamole is wonderful and I've never been disappointed with a dish."}
{"text":"Sub par.  Too expensive for too little mediocre food.  Not likely to return.  Beans are soupy and taste like dish water, better suited for a straw than fork.  Salsa is horrible.  One small mediocre enchilada for $10.  Sat on patio which was very nice.  Staff not at all attendant, such as soda glass was empty for more than 5 minutes with them frequently walking by.  Finally after waiting almost 10 minutes asked for and got my check."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place where you are treated like the food they serve, Eureka! You have found it!  From the water bottles, cups, cigarette buds and make shift sign all prior to entering the restaurant, should've read the writing in the wall.  Upon entering and being sat by a pleasant host/server(highlight of the visit) the bartender who served us was cordial but I asked myself \"why does he get to eat prior to us?\" It was 12:20 in the afternoon and he and the other employee were eating while we were waiting for them to serve us the food in the window right in front of us.  I was feeling sorry for the glassware that walked by us because it was violated by the server/bartender with all of those fingers up in it.  The food, honestly why serve it?  The milkshake concoction they called refried beans accompanied by the 2 inch tortillas for $11.95.  Words of wisdom to the owner, please re-evaluate your standards from the front door to the back!  Oh yea, the hungry bartender never washed his hands after the violating of the glassware or the shoveling of the food into his face.  That and the chip cloth that comes with your chips being immediately re-used, not right at any level."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight, and were so very impressed. We sat at the bar and were approached by the owner to find out if we'd ever been in before. We told him no, but we live in the neighborhood and just drove by and decided to try it. He then walked us through almost everything on the menu, gave us so many great recommendations, and made us feel very welcomed. We sat at the bar and had margaritas, chips and guacamole, chicken tacos, and mushroom quesadillas. The food is Mexico City-style (my favorite), and everything was excellent and reasonably priced for happy hour. Now that we know about this authentic neighborhood spot, we will definitely be visiting regularly. I highly recommend and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch with three friends. We found all the food delicious, the service was great, and the ambiance was very nice.  The chips were hot out of the kitchen, and their salsa was excellent. Among the four of us, we ordered Posole, tacos, and something else I cannot recall (it was a month or so ago that we went - sorry). Everything was flavorful and served hot.  Would definitely go again.  It's pretty small, so I wonder if they get crowded quickly?"}
{"text":"Wonderful clean spot. Not your normal Mexican food, this place has some flare and uniqueness. Excellent service."}
{"text":"This is not your traditional Mexican fare but it is very good.  Came here with a large group.  Everyone left talking about how good their entree was.  Very good flavors.  Service was great.  A bit pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Really nice atmosphere, nice little outdoor bar and the guacamole is to die for!!!! Their carne asada is an actual rib eye and is covered in a flavorful but not spicy red chile sauce. Service is very good, but beware they do not accept reservations."}
{"text":"I am so excited that Los Sombreros has opened a new location closer to me in North Scottsdale.  For years they have been serving the best upscale Mexican food in the Valley and with the new location I can enjoy it more often.  I was here today for lunch and everything was great.  The salsa for the chips was amazing.  My chiliquiles were delicious and the service was fantastic.  I can't wait to come back for happy hour and dinner in the very near future."}
{"text":"In a city with so many mediocre Mexican options, this is a rare find.  The crab fundido was excellent, as were the seafood enchiladas and pork green chili.  Service was prompt and friendly, even as the place rapidly filled up for the evening rush."}
{"text":"Definitely good for happy hour. Food is okay. Not worth regulat price though but the margaritas are bomb!"}
{"text":"Los sombreros has my heart and stomach. Love the food every time I come here. It is an awesome little spot on Scottsdale road with a small parking lot in the back.  I always end up ordering the 3 taco starter - I get chicken, potato and hibiscus. If you have never had the hibiscus taco you must get it now. So sweet and the most beautiful rose color.  The last time I came here my boyfriend ordered the al pastor. It was on special and I believe it was one of the last nights they were serving it. Spicy pork and pineapple, we ended up ordering another serving it was that good!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Ordered flan for dessert.  Not bad but nothing special.  Service was not very good. They did they they were short staffed as waiter called in sick.    Ice cream on the menu was not available.  Would not recommend and won't go back.  Just too many other Mexican restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch and the patio was perfect for this sunny day. My server was Rosie and very nice and helpful. I asked about the hibiscus taco because It sounded interesting. She highly recommended it & Rosie was  right! It was savory and a slightly tangy and a morsel of sweetness in every bite. I had chips with their delicious salsa. I highly recommend this place & will be back."}
{"text":"This place was FANTASTIC!!!!! Came from out of town to watch son race ASU, brought large family - food & service was tremendous. Honestly, across the board (even the kids loved it) can't say anything bad, the entire place was great!"}
{"text":"This place has gone south quickly. We arrived on a Friday Night. The place was empty, except a few people on the patio, we sat inside. Right after we ordered drinks three employees sat next to us and started to assemble Silverware and napkins and speaking very loudly. Really! One of my favorite dishes in Mexico is Steak Tampiquena, usually a marinated flank steak with cheese enchiladas. My wife and I both ordered it. Not sure what kind of steak it was but it was flavorless and overdone, we both ordered it medium. It also showed up already cut up, which is probably why it was overdone. The enchilada was very small, lacked much sauce and was cold as well. Refried beans were watered down mess. It was like buffet food slapped on a plate. No sizzling steak, no melting cheese, no sauce, no flavor. Help!! Just annoying employees doing their side work next to us. Help!!. This is our third and last time here. The prices are very high for what you get which is below average food and above average prices. Chips and bad \"salsa\" are extra. No mas Sombreros, the food has gone south and not in a good way. Adios Los Sombreros"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican cuisine. Gorgeous atmosphere. inside and especially outside. it's my 3 rd visit and I can't seem to get over the tamales. got the trio of tamales. one chicken. one beef. one corn. all amazing. Arturo my server \bartender was engaging, knowledgeable, and kept me entertained as a single person diner. I'd recommend him every time. what an great experience and Im absolutely hooked and will return soon and often. Jimmie"}
{"text":"This is my first dinner stop anytime I'm in Scottsdale, and always makes me look good when I recommend it.  This time, the standouts were the ceviche, the crab queso, the lamb adobo, and the  Cadillac marg.  Tablemates had other dishes they raved about.  Noteworthy notes:  I've not yet sat on the patio, but I can't explain why.  It looks awesome.  The margaritas are sufficiently stiff.  They're not my preferred carburetor cleaning strength, but neither are they simply jazzed-up lemonade or those super-acidic-1.0 pH version you get some places.  The service was a little lax this time, less attentive than before, and that's the only reason I'm not giving LS a 5 this time.  If you're after Mexican when in Scottsdale, this is the first place to point your ride."}
{"text":"A friend took us here for late night dining.  After 9 pm the bar offers a $5 menu which includes drinks, appetizers and entrees for $5 each.  He ordered us the fresh made guacamole, the queso fundido and the carnitas tacos.  We had $2 dos XX pints.   The guac was pretty good, topped off with pico de gallo and served with chips and one type of salsa.  The queso fundido was whole beans covered in a white cheese; it was pretty good.  The carnitas tacos were very good, served on small fried tortillas topped with cabbage, pico, and a radish slice.   I loved the pin wheel \"chicarone\" snacky chip that was mixed in with the tortilla chips. The bartender, Arturo took care of us, was friendly and attentive, but not overly so.  5 of us ate for like $35 bucks!  Hooray late night menu!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, not so great service. They were really understaffed and it took forever to get in on a Monday night."}
{"text":"I came in thinking that this restaurant would be great because of the building and the interior. But, everything was just the opposite. I ordered the chips and salsa, which was weird because chips are always free in Mexican restaurants, even in little fast food restaurants the chips and salsa are free for dine in customers. But, I got the chips and salsa, the lunch chicken enchilada, and a coke. The chips and salsa were beyond bland. The salsa was lack luster, and the chips were overly salty. I was hoping that my entrée would make up for the chips and salsa, but no. It came out looking absolutely stunning (like food porn on Instagram stunning), but was once again bland. The rice was the biggest disappointment (I love Mexican rice)...it was worse than the salsa. Absolutely no flavor at all, even with the green sauce that came with my enchilada. I thought the enchilada would make up for it, since it was my entrée and it looked beautiful, but the chicken was super sketchy and it was dripping in sauce, which made the tortilla soggy and me unhappy.   The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because the interior and exterior of the restaurant are beautiful, it has a fantastic drink menu (for when I can drink), and the people at the bar made me laugh with the conversation they were having. They really need to step up their food game if they are going to be charging these prices, because 9.95 for ONE lackluster enchilada makes me never want to come back here."}
{"text":"Remax happy hour! Great place- new owners! Food amazing- try house specialties Pollo con Espinaca tacos or puerco en mole verde tacos. Guac is amazing!  Will be back for more happy hours - outdoor patio is great during winter months! Thanks Kurt, Jeff & Rosie!!!"}
{"text":"So yesterday, May 6th, my 2 friends and I went here because I raved about how good the food is .. and the food is definitely 5 star!!!    The 1 star rating is for the situation that occurred yesterday. It was HOT out there, HOT, like 104.  The bar to the is naturally connected to the building, meaning, that the entrance to the bar is an open door to the rest of restaurant, well inside the dining room there were only 2 other tables when we sat down. We opted to sit at a table that was NOT year an a/c vent as one my friends was elderly and did not like the a/c blowing on her.  So here is the MAJOR PROBLEM I have and why I rated this 1 star.  So the flies that were INSIDE the restaurant were RIDICULOUS, I mean it ruined the whole dinner!! We were constantly killing flies, swatting flies, off us, off our food, out of our drinks.   HERE is my beef: when we told the restaurant staff, hostess and waitress, we were told that the Ecolab guy was supposed to show up there earlier in the day but cancelled and was going the next day.  MY PROBLEM IS THIS: they KNEW the flies were bad, they KNEW the Ecolab person was not coming for another day, THERE IS AN ACE HARDWARE less than 1/2 mile down the road, WHY DIDN'T THEY GO TO ACE AND GET SOME FLY TRAPS/FLY STRIPS......SOMETHING  TO CONTROL THE FLIES????  It was  utterly ridiculous.  I LOVE this place, the food is amazing, but to knowingly sit people in a room full of flies and be ok with it??? WRONG ANSWER!   I know this place is under new ownership as of some time last year, because when I took my then bf there one of the owners was there and actually came to our table to ask how we were and how our service and food was. He was pretty young, and I hope that he will read this review and school his employees on this.  As we were leaving a group of about 10 people came in to sit in the dining room, we thought, 'oh great, something to draw the flies away rom us\" lol, but as quickly as they sat down they left to sit out side, when I asked if they were leaving because of the flies, they said YES !!!"}
{"text":"Just left this restaurant... got tired of waiting for someone to greet us and take our order.  Not worth the price when the service is so poor. (every entree is over $20, you have to pay for chips.) We won't be back."}
{"text":"Update: had to go back again. Got the tamales this time and they were also amazing! Officially one of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Went in for a bite with my GF and our 3yo and had a great meal. My tamales were fantastic and my GF loved her veggie tacos. The guacamole was delicious also and almost our undoing as we got it to start"}
{"text":"This is the best mexican place in the phoenix area, except for maybe Barrio Cafe.  The food here is pretty fantastic and the margaritas are tasty (if a bit overpriced).  Considering I pretty much hated all the food in Phoenix or Scottsdale, this review should go pretty far.  The guac is great, the tortilla soup is hearty, filling, and tasty, and the shrimp dish is amazing.  Cheesy, with tortilla strips and loads of shrimp.  Well balanced.  I hate phoenix, but I love sombrero's.   Don't get take out, it loses its flavor.  Plus dining outside is pretty dope."}
{"text":"Food is ok i had the corn chowder, the chicken tacos... It was not expensive... The two salsa were ok... I've read some reviews this is very good place - ok. Not my taste. I'll come back and give it another shot. Wait staff nice again they were fine... Nothing to shout about nor can I really complain"}
{"text":"Went by today for the first time and I have to say it was one of the best most unique Mexican  places to eat in Arizona.  The service was great and the food was outstanding.  If your in the area you need to check this place out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Did not like the small menu, not enough variety of food!  Way over priced for the quality of food. It is a different type of Mexican food than what I am traditionally used to.. I did not like that they charge for everything, even for rice and beans,also charged $4 for an extra taco for the kids plate!  Probably will not return.."}
{"text":"How refreshing. A real gourmet mexican (yes, i said that) joint I can ride a bike to. Moving to South Scottsdale, from downtown, has been somewhat frustrating. But being this close to Los Somberos is a big help.  I first went several years ago when they were in a strip mall on S. Scottsdale Rd. Got dragged there by a couple local restaurant people who kept raving about it. Shockingly fucking spicy and delicious. One app had us hallucinating. Loved it.  Time passed and they opened up this great little house-style location further up the road. Apparently the chef/owner and his wife got divorced. She kept the place. I was worried. But she's making it work fantastically.    THINGS TO TRY:  steve the bartender's margaritas: you can actually taste the tequila, so call your favorite. i like the patron silver marg. many prefer the cadillac marg that has orange juice. bear in mind, when you are talking, steve is listening. he has ears like a bat. if you don't want him to hear you saying something embarrassing about yourself, don't say it.   shrimp fundido: white cheese melted over sauteed fajita-style veggies and big fresh-tasting shrimp. great with corn or flour tortillas.   chips: pretty good. the salsas are a little mild for my taste. not bland, they have plenty of tart and sweetness. just wish they were rounded out a little more.   smoked chicken tacos: only ask for this when it's already the special. they'll try to accommodate when it isn't the special, but it will pale. when it's a legit special, they use nicely smoked, succulent dark meat. not that cubed up breast junk. i hate chicken breast. 5 stars if they add this to the daily menu.   carne asada tacos: consistently best i've had in PHX.   carnitas: a very generous, juicy, tender portion. they always happily hand over flour tortillas for me.   beef short rib: get this if you require lots of flavor. and by flavor, i mean rendered beef fat.   Lots of other stuff on the menu, and always at least one app and one dinner special. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I just love this place! Killer tree-shaded patio or nice big tables inside, with truly outstanding Mexican food, served by people who care about what they're doing. The bar can make almost any kind of margarita you can imagine ... they do something involving cucumber margaritas that the table next to me was raving over. There are a few standouts on the menu ... the smoked chicken enchilada is exquisite ... the huitlacoche quesadilla appetizer is crispy and cheesy and awesome ... and you haven't LIVED until you've had their queso fundido ... with cinnamon. Trust me ... you will gorge on it!!! Scottsdale Road just south of Thomas ... you'll be glad you ate here. It's a locals hangout for the folks who know!!"}
{"text":"I'd like to know the \"other\" Mexican food places that are so much better. Los Sombreros is awesome! The drinks are poured with a heavy hand, which almost justifies paying $9 a cocktail, but that's to be expected at a lot of places. The salsa, first off, is to die for! The hotter of the two has a very strong chipotle flavor, which I love, but for those who don't the other one was just as good. The weird little pinwheel wheat things they give you with the chips are not my cup of tea, but just about everything else is. I think the spot is totally quaint and charming, and the servers are always accommodating. I'm vegan and started disecting the menu when the waitress asked if I was vegan, and I am, she suggested I get the chef's special vegan dish- rarely does that happen! It was amazing, the sauce was incredible, the potatoes mushrooms and corn were cooked to perfection and I appreciated the extra veggies and avocado. My boyfriend loved his, which was a fish dish, and everytime I go everyone loves it! Try it out."}
{"text":"Good place. I have no idea what it was I are other than shrimp and a green sauce but it was tasty. My daughter had chicken enchiladas and they were massive and couldn't finish them."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Come here if you are an adventurous eater, as they have some not-so-average choices! Hibiscus tacos, corn chowder, and crab and mango salad are only a few of the many delicious items! Our waiter was very caring and descriptive of the food, and we definitely will return!!!"}
{"text":"The food is typically delicious.  It is New Mexican cuisine, not Central Mexican, etc.  Just ask them- they'll tell you.  This used to be one of our favorites, but they got too full of themselves as they got too full of customers.  They skimped on some ingredients (though you'd never know unless you started eating there soon after it opened).  The service became rude, with a few pleasant exceptions.  They started to nickel and dime (e.g. serving a tiny amount of Chipotle salsa and charging for a refill). They began adding an 18% gratuity to parties larger than four, then providing service deserving of no tip at all (and I am typically pretty generous since I know what being a server is like and appreciate that most servers are struggling financially).  We avoid it now.  However, we found the Blue Adobe in Mesa.  The food there is as good (which is a compliment) and the service is usually very friendly and attentive.  Try this place once, and see for yourself.  For a good test, go with a party of 6."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The staff always has great customer service! I love the chile rellenos!!!"}
{"text":"What a gem, located in airpark just across from EOS fitness. This place serves up some of the most authentic Mexican food in Scottsdale. The bartender is very knowledgable on tequilas and does not mind making custom margaritas to your liking. My favorite is the Chilli Relleno! The absolute best I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"This little Mexican place has a great happy hour and wonderful service. The food was great and our server Yolanda made the experience very pleasant. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Does all of scottsdale eat at poor serviced, bad chips and salsa places and so this is the norm?  I live in Seattle people and it's hard to believe but yes, I've had better food at the taco truck down the street. AND the service was better.  let's start with the location.  they sat us at the two top right next to the parking lot, why is this even a table??  it's next to all the nastee exhaust fumes and no good views of anything except for the ugly ass tree next to us.  The chips and salsa were 1. under salted and 2. under flavored and 3. stale.  Gross.  I ordered the fish tacos and the corn chowder.. which had to be doused with Tapatio.  and my dinner mate had the 'best dish in the house' which was a carnitas dish.  um.. we should have left after they refused to move us.  poor poor experience.  Don't go here if you want a decent meal."}
{"text":"Wow. This place caught me off guard the first time I meandered through the door. From the street, it looks like it's going to be another average mexican food joint, but take one step inside and you'll immediately notice that this place has something to offer.  The food is the most authentic, best presented Mexican I've ever had at a restaurant in AZ, down the line from apps to desserts. The ambiance is perfect and befitting of a gem like this.   Servings are good size, so much so that I found it to be a little pricey for only two, but I highly recommend it on all accounts for groups of four or more."}
{"text":"Went here with family and had a great time!! We tried to make a reservation earlier in the day but were told that the time we wanted wasn't available to so we took the risk and walked in with a party of 6 on a Friday night at 7:30. And to our surprise we were able walk in and get a table! Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable. ALL of the food was fantastic and super authentic! They have a great patio area that would be great to check out when the weather is right!   Would definitely go back again!!!"}
{"text":"I was meeting a group there for lunch and had called ahead to ask if I should call in my order since I am on a limited lunch time and they said no, it wasn't busy and would only take 5 minutes to make tacos.  I get there and waited that whole time, ended up having to ask them to just make mine to-go and left with my lunch time ending.   No fun.   Thirty minutes later my friends call me up: \"Hey, that place was gross so we left and are grabbing Julio G's, want some tacos?\" :D"}
{"text":"Had the absolute WORST experience last night at this restaurant!!! They didn't have our reservation for 20-30 people and shoved us outside on a teeny tiny patio. It was very awkward, the road noise was so bad our speaker had to change the format of the entire event! But that was just the beginning! We waited for 30-40 mins to get orders taken, then another 45 for the food to arrive, the waiter was the absolute rudest I have ever encountered. I have worked in many, many restaurants and understand when things are slammed or other factors but this guy was such a jerk! During this entire time the owner knew our situation and apparently didn't care because he never came to our table to apologize or make it right. Plus there was a 20% auto gratuity added for some guy to take forever and be a jerk! The two appetizers they comped hardly made up for the horrific experience! Oh and one stall for over a hundred people doesn't seem like enough bathrooms. I will NEVER go back to this hell hole. I advise you all to do the same and stay away."}
{"text":"Extremely good. Seasoned differently than any other Mexican restaurant we've tried! Every entrée has a unique and flavorful taste!!! A lot of fun to share the different selections!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. Try the traditional rellena with veggies, black beans and rice. The chorizo and black bean fundido was absolutely yummy! Creamy guacamole! Husband had pork chipotle."}
{"text":"If you can get past the decor and the location, you will love the food. If this place was more north on Scotts Rd and looked nicer, everyone would rave about it. Great, authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"simply put, I think this is the best Mex restaurant in the valley.  At least of all the ones I have eaten at.  Get the guac salad.  SO GOOD!!!   Also the mole sauce is to die for and even better their pork in chipotle sauce.  In fact I have eaten their many many times and had nothing less than an exceptional meal.  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Definitely a \"Must Go\" place! Great decor & atmosphere with friendly service. Although we dined inside, the outdoor patio with cooling mist sprayers made it very inviting. The FOOD WAS FABULOUS! From the crispy thin chips and delicious just-right-spicy salsa before the meal (along with the scrumptous guacamole) to the large, beautifully presented entrees, all was very tasty.  I had the Carnitas with my 2 choices of black beans and veggies. Meat was tender and flavorful, beans good (I liked that they were served separately in a small cup), and don't skip the veggies! They were a great combination that have a delicate grilled flavor. EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD! My husband thoroughly enjoyed his Tamale with refried beans and rice. I didn't get to taste but it was beautifully plated and he loved it. Our entrees were served with tortillas. Lots of food.  I'm sure you'll love Los Sombreros too!"}
{"text":"I had the carnitas soft tacos and wifey had the crunchy chicken tacos. Both delicious. Although there was only one server she did an amazing job serving the outside patio. She kicked ass and made it enjoyable for a great lunch on the patio. Will return soon. Oh and the house margarita's are fresh and left me with a buzz yeaaahhh"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I were in the mood for some non-greasy Mexican food so we ventured up to Los Sombreros last Friday. We have been there several times but we always order the same thing. I get the pollo con espinacas and he gets the pollo enchiladas.   It was a nice evening so we chose to sit in the outdoor patio area - great atmosphere with twinkling lights, little fire pits going and a guy playing guitar and singing in Spanish. They were very busy that night so the food did take a little while to get, but other than that the service was good. And besides, you have the chips and salsa to snack on while they prepare your food.  Los Sombreros is not your typical taco shop. Don't walk in expecting to find greasy tacos and humongous burritos. It's more what I would call \"foofy\" (technical term) Mexican food.  My pollo con espinacas is two generous portions of chicken served in a chipotle cream sauce with spinach. On the side you can get rice, beans or veggies so I got rice and veggies. This dish is SO good. The chipotle cream sauce is just the right combination of spicy and creamy - make a great dip for the chips too! And the portion is big enough I always take half home.  I didn't get a margarita but this place has a HUGE list of tequilas so if you're looking for something other than Cuervo this place can satisfy.  I've always been happy with my dining experience at Los Sombreros. It's a great date place with great food."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's easily my favorite Mexican food in the valley.  Great service, great guacamole, great margaritas.  I've been here 3 times and have never been disappointed by the entrees.  Be advised, they don't take reservations, and there is usually a wait on the weekends.  However, if you're going mid-week, it's usually pretty easy to get a table."}
{"text":"It is nice weather to sit outside in the patio. Seafood tacos made with fish and shrimp were delicious with a little bit of sweetness. Chicken mole was delicious with the juicy sauce and tasty warm tortilla. Chips were thin and crisp that went well with two types of green salsa"}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere and service. The owner came by our table a couple of times and was very patient with us as he answered our questions and made recommendations. My wife and I had the guacamole, fish tacos and puerco en chipotle and all were unbelievable good. The service was first rate and the owner came by our table a couple of times to ensure our experience was great....and it was! It was obvious the owner has a passion for great food and for his customers. His staff reflect the same attitude as well.   We decided to set in the dining room but there is a lovely patio as well that looked very inviting."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. The ambiance was comfortable although they don't have booths which we prefer. We eat at a table 6 nights a week and enjoy a booth when eating out. We wish more restaurants used them, but they probably take up more valuable floor space or are more expensive. The building appeared to be a home conversion. The service was adequate. The food had a unique take which is a prerequisite in a city of predominately Mexican restaurants. The reason for the lost star is the price points. Two smoked chicken, the uniqueness, enchiladas for $15 isn't competitive with our usual places. Don Ruben's has combination dinners for $9.95 the last time we visited and the online menu states. Don't you hate it when the online prices don't match the menu upon arrival? They also have decent parking for Scottsdale and a beckoning patio which we didn't take advantage of because of temperature. Worth a try, but we probably won't return."}
{"text":"We know Mexican food but Los Sombreros showed us food that we hadn't seen prepared or presented before. From the foods to our server, Yolanda, everything was terrific. Our usual go-to place is 45 minutes away in Cave Creek. Los Sombreros is much closer and the menu is much more refined. We would recommend Los Sombreros to anyone wanting excellent value for their money. The patio is amazing."}
{"text":"Los Sombreros is one of our favorite spots for Mexican food. My husband and I have been going here for years - back when we were first dating! We've always had a good time and a good meal here. However, we've only ever eaten dinner/happy hour here.  Our favorite is the Puerco en Chipotle. It's basically a huge portion of slow roasted and extra juicy pork in a chipotle sauce with Oaxaca cheese on top. Oh my god. This just melts in your mouth. The flavors are so good together. I just wish it had more cheese!   My husband has had the Lamb adobo before, which is a lamb shank in a spicy sauce. Again, this is really tender and flavorful.   I've had the smoked chicken enchilada dinners several times here and they are consistently good. The chicken is flavorful and blends well with the chipotle crema.   For happy hour we've had the grilled ribeye steak tacos, guacamole, and well margaritas. Everything was good, but the steak wasn't as tender as the other meats we've had here and probably wouldn't order again.   For dessert, they have rotating flan flavors. The traditional flan is my husband's favorite, but mine is the Bailey's/Kahlua flan. Oooh, oh so good. This is a great way to end the night."}
{"text":"Los Sombreros (downtown Scottsdale) is one of my husband's favorite restaurants but due to its location and small parking lot, it wasn't one of our frequent dining destinations. Now that a location opened up down the street from us in North Scottsdale, we are so happy! We came here opening weekend and were surprised to find it wasn't packed. There were a few diners outside enjoying the lovely patio and a smattering of folks inside. The actual inside has tons of room - a front dining area that leads into the bar, a side dining area, and a back dining area. We originally wanted to sit outside, but after finding it a bit chilly we decided to move inside. We sat at a nice booth that faced the bar and open kitchen. This location's design choices seem drastically different from the Downtown location - more of a family friendly/Mexican chain feeling. This isn't bad in anyway, just different. It is still very nicely decorated and I loved the tables and large glass mirrors.   To start, I ordered the margarita de coco (a coconut margarita) and my husband ordered La Damiana (a margarita with Damiana liquer).  Since it was opening weekend, it took a long time for our drinks to arrive. My husband wasn't too impressed with his drink, but he wanted to try something new so that's on him. I knew perfectly well how a coconut margarita should taste and mine wasn't very coconutty. The pineapple juice really overpowered the drink. It was good, but not what I was expecting. After our drinks arrived, complimentary chips and salsa arrived. They were good to munch on, since we were hungry and couldn't wait for our meals to arrive.  Halfway through our drinks (and we are slow drinkers) our meals finally arrived. I ordered the Puerco en Chipotle because that is my favorite - slow cooked pork in a chipotle sauce with a sprinkling of cheese on top. Simple, yet oh-so delicious. Normally, my husband and I would order this and split but we decided to get our own dishes that night. Good thing we did because the portions were much smaller than the portions served up at the downtown Los Sombreros location. It was still delicious. My husband ordered the Camarones Al Tequila - which are shrimps in a chipotle cream sauce and some bacon. It was uber yummy. My husband really enjoyed his meal.   Overall, our food was fantastic and tasted the same as the Downtown location. Taste-wise, it met our expectations. The drinks and service could use some improvement, but it was opening weekend. Our server was extremely nice and constantly smiling. She even apologized for the slowness and gave us a coupon to use for our next visit. It was a very nice touch and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and were very excited for being so close to this place! Literally walking distance! The ambience and service are authentic, but the food is just NOT RIGHT! The chips are plain, salsa is good, of each dish we've chosen, none was eatable! The refried beans tasted anything but beans! All we can say is that it is a shame such a good location, and potential, we so little care for the food it self! Hopefully it will change for nothing remains the same forever!"}
{"text":"Cool looking restaurant and ambiance. The margaritas are amazing. The guacamole was fluffed with a lot of lettuce therefore it looked more than it was. I ordered the crab enchilada and the crab didn't seem as fresh as I would have hoped. It was a good experience."}
{"text":"My BFF and I stumbled upon this place, thanks to our lyft driver. We are SO glad for his recommendation.  We were pleased with the menu and, in fact, were overwhelmed by all the options. Everything sounded tasty! The Pollo Con Espinacas was delicious and flavorful but what I loved the most was the Crispy Hibiscus Taco! It was such a fun and tasty combo  ps: the guac was  and the spicy salsa will burn your mouth   Side note: Los Sombreros was a cute restaurant with an old-to wn vibe and super cute decor, especially the women's restroom #random, I know. Just trust me"}
{"text":"Thought we would try this place on recommendation from a taxi driver . The chili rellenos were DELICIOUS! One would have been plenty but you are served TWO! The beans and rice were also very good . Let's back up though ! We started with guacamole . It was simple and chunky and tasty . Like REAL authentic Mexican guacamole. Husband ordered the carnititas and stated they were the best he had ever had . He cooks carnitas at home and he said these were better than his . The margaritas were a little different and very very good . Service , excellent . The owner come to the table to see how we were doing . We have been visiting Scottsdale a week and this was easily the best meal we had . This is a must visit when in the area !"}
{"text":"A fresh take on Mexican food. They actually had more veggies than just beans! Sunday brunch was interesting and well priced. Their kids menu was great: cheese quesadilla with rice beans, guacamole, and a drink for $5!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least 3 times and had a great meal every time. Everything is fresh and high quality. The Guacamole is awesome. The carnitas is legit. The fish tacos are not traditional, but are very good. One time we brought an out of town guest who fancies herself a chili relleno aficionado. She tried them and loved them, and was very impressed with the place overall.   The staff is accommodating and friendly. The owners and managers obviously care about the patrons satisfaction and experience. It has a very nice neighborhood feel, and is often bustling with locals and visitors. They have a very cool old world/funky decor, and a very nice patio dining area with an outdoor bar.  We were there for a very festive Cinco de Mayo complete with a great musician, strumming and singing Mexican songs from table to table.   Great place, you should try it!"}
{"text":"Well I am happy to write this update. Earlier this year I gave up on Los Sombreros in a huff... then not long after I saw an \"Under New Management\" sign on the building... Hmmm... interesting... They re-opened about a week ago so I decided to check things out.  What a difference! The updated place was busy, we were promptly greeted and sat by a very sweet and friendly employee. The vibe was upbeat and happy. The place still has it's unique charm but better-squeaky CLEAN with a better table layout and the place is spruced up a bit. The food was phenomenal- even better than I remembered. (my seafood crepes were great, but the chipotle pork.. ohmigod)  Yolanda took care of us and gave us great recommendations... when I shared how happy we were compared to our previous experiences she even introduced us to Jeff one of the new owners who shared their history and connections to South Scottsdale. It was great and I could not be happier that Los Sombreros has been revived!  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Very attentive service and the food is unique and very good. Nice to have a 2nd location!"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent.  Good honest margaritas, fresh chips and tasty salsas.  Food is plentiful and outstanding. Doesn't seem to be a tourist spot, but more of a locals hangout. All of the wait staff was friendly, especially Estaban. We are only here for one week, but will return to eat here again before we leave. If you want good Mexican food, this a place not to be missed."}
{"text":"Cute little place on the outskirts of Old Town, therefore not as crowded. Cute little patio, although the flies were a bit annoying.  I had the Chicken emolada lunch special. Perfect portions as I was full, but not overly so to where I was miserable. The mole sauce was delicious, just a hint of spicy and the beans were creamy and rich.  I got a frozen house margarita and I have to say it was refreshing and  large!"}
{"text":"I am a foodie that loves to cook. I like to eat food that takes effort. Food that takes hours to prepare. This is what makes paying premium prices at a restaurant worth it to me. This restaurant is totally worth it!       My husband and I started with the corn cake soufflé, it was amazing. It is light fluffy, sweet and spicy. We then shared the Crepas De Mariscos and Puerco en Chipolte. I wasn't sure what to expect from the Crepas but when they arrived I was pleased to see two large \"burrito\" sized crepes on the plate topped with a green sauce. They were generously filled with fresh fish, shrimp and crab. They were so good I let out an audible sigh when I tasted them. The  Puerco is basically carnitas in a really good chipotle sauce topped with cheese. The pork is so tender and has a slow roasted smokey flavor. It was so good. The food was top quality.      Our server was friendly and attentive during the meal. I am really looking forward to trying more dishes."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix this past weekend for a wedding and wanted a low key, fun, yummy mexican feast before heading for a night out on the town.  Los Sombreros was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel and it was great!  We sat on the adorable, sparkly light-lit patio and stayed warm with the help of two heaters.  The place was pretty busy but not too loud.  The margaritas were huge and strong as can be and made just the way we liked em!  We shared an order of guacamole - i was slightly disappointed since other yelpers RAVED about it - i thought it was pretty standard, a little better than \"just OK\".  Both of us ordrerd the chilaquiles (he shrimp, me chicken) and they were fantastic although it would have been great  if our server told us that each dish was a legit 10 lbs! We EASILY could have split!  we had such a fun time, the service was good, food was good and the patio was a great backdrop for a casual, albeit fairly romantic meal."}
{"text":"For the price, it was definitely not worth it.. Pretty terrible house margarita, too frozen to drink through the straw and pretty flavorless besides the tequila. The tacos were alright, but 3 tiny tacos for $14?? I think it is safe to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years but have noticed in the past year or so a decline in the overall quality of the food and the service. The menu has stayed the same but the food just doesn't have the same attention t detail. Our last visit was over the top disappointing-I ordered the crab mango salad which comes plated in a high mold. I tasted it before I broke open the mold an it tasted weird so I broke it open and a fowl smell hit our party's noses that clearly indicated that the crab had gone south. We asked the waiter to take it away and he came back to show us the can it came in? Okay. I know that can happen but if it does, the manager or owner should have come and something extra done, don't you think? It was taken off the bill. period. I had some of my husband's entree because I didn't want to slow down the rest of the meal. My brother ordered a chicken dish and got enchiladas instead, by the time he had several bites and realized it-we were over it- What happened Los Sombreros?"}
{"text":"For such a beautiful place, they had the worst service I've ever seen!  I took my dad out there for his birthday, and the waitress was rude from the beginning.  She wouldn't take half of our drink orders and she didn't get out dinner orders right.  We were still patient and calm until she decided she wasn't going to fix our orders and she wouldn't bring us more drinks.  When I asked for a manager she said she was the manager and there was no one else I could speak to!  I've never witnessed something like that at a restaurant and they should be embarrassed by their service!!  It blows my mind!  There are much better restaurants in the area that are guaranteed to have better service.  Fast food restaurants have better service and nicer staff."}
{"text":"Had the Tuesday fish taco special and the stuffed poblano pepper dinner and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Been eating there since 1997, in the old location. One of my favorite places, original and delish.  I always order a Queso Fundido, marguerita, and try to experience new things each time. The chocolate tamale is a must for desert."}
{"text":"Amazing! Delicious drinks, friendly staff and perfect outside bar :-) Try the strawberry margarita! New owners are making the best changes!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend and I wanted to check it out on my work trip in March 2009.  Well at the end of the work day we were all scratching our heads about where to get dinner so I suggested we try out Los Sombreros.  We had a party of 11 people and I felt a little pressure going in just because if it was bad then I wouldn't hear the end of it.  When setting up the reservation the person on the phone was easy to deal with and he called me back after my initial call because he wasn't sure about being able to fit us in on this busy Wednesday evening .  The overall experience of Los Sombreros was exactly what I was hoping for.  We had to sit inside on because of our group size, but it was fine.  The service was good, they had two servers working our table. The margaritas with fresh lime juice were really tasty.  Guacamole was incredible.  My crab enchiladas came and wow I was in heaven, even the sides I ordered of vegetables and black beans were full of flavor.  I think EVERYONE in our group liked their dinners, so I felt pretty cool for a few minutes at least.   All in all one of the best Mexican meals I've ever had.  I live in Michigan and we don't get this kind of food up here.    One note: Not many options for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Seriously this was terrible, a real shame as I had heard that the original location had some of the best Mexican food in Phoenix.  My husband and I love authentic Mexican (not just the cheese and sour cream loaded places you find around town), so the menu looked promising,  BUT...don't waste your time here.  My chicken was inedible and my husband's soup was really watered down.  Plus the service was atrocious for a place that was not busy when we were there. Shame."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican Cuisine in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, Los Sombreros provides a rich and friendly destination for anyone looking for a plate sizzling, mouthing watering experience.   Just south of Thomas Los Sombreros has been providing its patrons with stiff, sweet, and ohh so salty Patron Margaritas since its founding and its a great place to stop at the bar for a quick drink a some tasty guacamole.  A little pricey for a Mexican restaurant and the service can be a little suspect but in the end definitely one of the best authentic restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. The appetizer and main course winners of the night were the queso fundido with chorizo and black beans, homemade guacamole, smoked chicken enchiladas, green tamales and the chile rellenos with chipotle pork. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT MISS the crepes cajeta for dessert. They are unbelievable! The only disappointment of the evening was the service. We were one of only three tables being served at that hour, and our server was not at all timely about pouring water or bringing extra dishes when we asked for them. That said, the food is absolutely worth future visits."}
{"text":"The only reason this is not rated a one star is that one out of the five entrees was OK.  The other four were not really hot when served, tasteless and way overpriced.  We will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"I arrived at Los Sombrero's around 7:30 pm on a Friday night. Although it's located on a major street, the restaurant has a nice 'tucked-away' feeling.   There was plenty of parking, and plenty of seating, which I definitely was not expecting on a Friday night. While it wasn't busy, it was by no means a ghost town. There were plenty of people there to give it a lively atmosphere, but there was enough space to give it a more private feel in the outdoors area where my girlfriend and I sat.   Our waitress came to us rather quickly after we were seated. She was professional, friendly, and very efficient all evening. The food was good, not amazing. I ordered 3 soft shell chicken tacos, and the portions were not huge. I ordered a side of rice too, but wasn't a huge fan of it and felt that it was a tad overcooked.The chips and salsa that we had was absolutely delicious! I was a very big fan of the salsa, as well as the chips.   All in all, the atmosphere was fun, but nothing too special. The food was average, but the service was great."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed the 'original' Los Sombreros on Scottsdale, so were quite interested to try the new one closer to our residence.  It was not disappointig with interesting takes on Mexican dishes and a huge lists of Tequilas.  The atmosphere is different, but the seating is much better and the more open interior is more appealing."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've ever eaten. Food is unique and tastes great. Every thing I've had here is wonderful! I've been here 3 times in the last week!"}
{"text":"I thought all was lost in Scottsdale, how could we be living so close to Mexico and not have a descent Mexican restaurant and then I found Los Sombreros. My goodness the food is amazing, the margaritas, to die for. The entire staff was extremely helpful. They just cant go wrong.   I have only been there twice and both times I was thoroughly impressed. I had the Enchiladas de pollo my first time, delicious, and my dining partner had the Mole Poblano (He's from Mexico City and he said its one of the best mole hes had in the states)  Second time around I had the Tacos dorados, and a few appetizers, the guacamole and the Tortilla soup are a must, they are outrageously awesome.  The only down side is it can get pretty warm inside, we ask to move outside to the misted patio and were completely comfortable."}
{"text":"I have been dying to come to this place for several years, but just didn't get around to it.  I met the original owner/chef years ago on the way to Mexico City and since then I wanted to visit the restaurant.  Well thanks to Groupon, it was the final motivation to my butt in there.  First off, I don't truly classify this restaurant as \"mexican\" food as most people know it.  The food is much more complex than typical mexican food and thats the part I love about it.  I was there on a Tuesday evening around 5pm.  The place was already busy inside, but I was never greeted at the entrance by anyone.  I simply walked in, looked around and found more comfort at the bar outside.  The bartender was young, new and not really experienced enough to give me great insight into the menu selections, but that was ok, he was new to the place.  I observed the level of service throughout and service or greeting of people arriving at the restaurant was almost an after thought. But hey, Groupon was expiring and they were getting busy.  It seemed to catch them off guard.    Chips and Salsa were very good and both salsas had excellent, mild flavor, but didn't over power anything.  You could truly enjoy the taste of the salsa.  I wasn't sure if there were nopales in the salsa, so I asked, but didn't get an answer.  I next ordered the Huitlacoche crepas (9.95), they were very good, slightly sweet with plenty of cheese in the crepe and topped with a ample amount of pomegranate.  It was good, but I would not order it again, more because of the sweetness of it, rather than the creation itself.  It was well presented and very tasty.  My meal was brought to me shortly after the arrival of the appetizer, consequently my meal was returned, and later brought back, but not quite as hot.  But it was DELICIOUS.  The Lamb Adobo is certainly an item not to be missed.   It was tender and juicy, ample amount of food and the Adobo (Ancho chilie sauce ))was extremely good.   I had it with a side of rice and beans, although the portions of both were smaller than I would have expected.  The Lamb Adobo is clearly a winner on their menu, and is the motivating factor to return and try other unique and delicious dinners.    I waited for a check for more than 20 minutes and then once the credit card was placed, it took another 10 minutes to notice it.  They were busy, I'll give them that.  However with the food as great as it is, I would hope that service levels could be escalated.  Simple things such as recognizing you when you enter the building even to say \"we'll be right with you\" is all it takes.  Checking on you after you have your meal are basic service elements that can use improvement at this establishment.  For my first, much anticipated visit, I was relatively disappointed only in the service levels, but certainly not the food.  The food is delciouis and I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican restaurant!! Great service sweet homey feel inside and a lovely patio. The food was gourmet but not pretentious just creative with delicious flavors. The chicken tamales were amazing and my husband got the steak meal that was just so flavorful. My tamale meal was a delicious lunch the next day too! Great portions and price. Omg the chocolate ice cream is home made and delicious don't pass that up it was a real treat after an excellent meal!! Now I'm hungry and want to go back ASAP ohh good margs too!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. Not too far from old town Scottsdale. What you'll find is a friendly atmosphere and fantastic food. Authentic Mexico City style food. Outdoor patio in the back is inviting and comfortable. With owners on site their customer first attitude never gets old. I spent three months in Arizona and visit this restaurant at least twice weekly. Don't miss taco Tuesday. And no I am not a relative of the owner or anyone who works there."}
{"text":"This place has a nice Texas meets Arizona feel to it. The chips and salsa are wonderful. Had the crunchy tacos... True to their word, they are crunchy. Go for the prime rib soft tacos and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We love Mexican food. In a bad way. Why does a place with amazing food (espinaca queso, crispy potato tacos, steak tacos) less than 10 minutes away from our house with a beautiful (albeit overlooking Gold's Gym) patio get 2 stars?  No water. Requested multiple times from both server and food runner. Server clearly remembered I had asked for water about 10 minutes before and got really weird. Just apologize and bring water! Don't stay silent and awkward and avoid us!  I'm a habitual 20% tipper to a fault...not this time. This place lost me as a potential regular."}
{"text":"very good carnitas.  the pork is moist, tender and flavorful. the pico di gallo salsa is fantastic, the best i have had.  goat meat used in the tacos are a little on the dry side."}
{"text":"Didn't like it, but we have the best Mexican in Dallas so I am biased.  The margaritas were decent. Salsa was ehh, just had brisket tacos for apps...Cute patio. Live music, as in the guy with guitar singing \"la bamba!\"  Wouldn't go back. Crowd was kind of boring. Other places along Scottsdale Blvd looked way more lively."}
{"text":"Savory Mexican cuisine. Awesome patio that hides Scotts Blvd noise somehow. Great bar area - cozy and stocked well. Mushroom & bacon tacos all day. Jicama & orange salad a rainbow in your mouf! Guac left to salting to your liking. Dining companion had pollo molè & ate every bit."}
{"text":"Other reviewers have pointed this out, but I must be emphatic - Los Sombreros does not do ANY of the standard Mexican dishes done in the other Phoenix Mexican restaurants.  To reiterate - Someone used to our Mexican food will not find one entree on Los Sombreros' menu that they have had before.  It is with this new found reality that my family found itself desperate to find the waitress before she filled our drink orders so we could leave.  I really do have some of the most closed minded eaters around me.  No cheese crisp!  No fried logs covered in enchilada sauce!  We all looked and looked through the menu and even though I'm pretty familiar will most of the dishes, even I couldn't find something that I thought they could do.    Our waitress appeared with our drinks (yikes!) so I explained our ignorance and asked her for recommendations.  She was so understanding, and immediately asked each person what they usually like and directed them to something on the menu that filled the bill.  Every person at the table loved what they got, and they even sent over some chips and salsa to help us feel more at home.  I had the chicken with mole, and it was seriously the best mole I've ever had, even in Mexico.  It was light, whereas mole can sometimes get very rich.  The tacos the others had were excellent.  By the way, the wine list is by far the best I've seen at a Mexican restaurant.  I had a really good glass of Pinot Noir."}
{"text":"Go.  Just do it.    You'll walk in the backside of the restaurant to enter and pass the nice patio.  You'll enter a door that splits the bar from the kitchen.  You'll see lined up a bunch of wonderful appetizers and entrees and you'll wonder why you have put up with inadequate food during your trip to Scottsdale.  You'll sit down and get a wonderful server and laugh and eat (get the guac and queso fundito!) and wonder that maybe there is a bit of magic left in Scottsdale, a town where a lot of the native magic has been bottled and bleed away.  It's a great little place and you'll know that for such a small place to make it they have to construct interesting and tasty dishes like Hibiscus Enchiladas.    One of the best meals I've ever had in the Phoenix metro area.  It's a casual, romantic, and fulfilling experience."}
{"text":"OK, if you haven't been here, you MUST!! It is a \"joint\" & not much by way of ambience, but the food & selections are totally amazing!! It's my Mexican Food take out go to every time"}
{"text":"Simply delish!!!!  And gluten free friendly.  Not your typical Mexican food, a bit more \"interior,\" many made with seafood.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Seriously-  everything is fresh and made in house; even their amazing sour cream is made right here.  Stopped on our way through back to Vegas- I would say I wouldn't mind driving down from Vegas just to eat here again. Ambiance is wonderful, simple clean and to the point. Staff is very friendly and helpful. My compliments to the chefs as this is in my top 5 best for authentic Mexican food.  We are from New Mexico- we know good \"New Mexican\" food but we also are well travelled in the southwest and into Mexico as well- and have tasted several variations of regional authentic Mexican dishes-  I must say- this establishment is a hands down MUST experience!!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter was visiting from the San Francisco area and wanted good, even gourmet Mexican food.  Los Sombreros is the place!  The roasted pork in a chipotle sauce was definitely the best. Chili Rejeno good. Guacamole was EXCELLENT and a good way to wait for the freshly cooked food. Presentation was also eye appealing.  Friendly good service."}
{"text":"Didn't like the salsa or the chips - and that's a pretty important component of Mexican food. They were kinda rude to us as well... although I will say they were attentive and informative. I guess it's just that they had us feeling like we weren't good enough to eat there. They were pretty strict about substitutions too - as in, they were against them. They don't seem to want to let you have flour tortillas instead of corn. Personally, I find corn tortillas to be quite vile.  Another staple they offer that wasn't very impressive was the margarita. It tasted like just a grocery store-bought mix that they stuck expensive tequilla in (if you pay extra - the standard issue is Cuervo). I had some tacos and they were good, but they didn't blow me away. They did end up agreeing to make them with flour tortillas, but as the dish was handed to me I was informed that they would never do it that way for me again. Huh? Wow, so I had a one of a kind meal.  My rating may be a little misleading because I think other people would like it more than I did. I think it's a nice environment - cute little restaurant inside, and great patio outside (that would be better when it's not so hot). I want to give this a 2.5, but can't and I don't consider this to be a 3... however, as you can see from the other reviews, I'm in the minority here.   I think I may be a little too fussy and cheap to eat here - I like my food simple and they over-complicate the dishes and over-charge for them. They won't let me substitute things (which is something you can't do to a fussy person) or even leave something off the dish. This indicates to me either a level of pretentiousness or some degree of incompetence... I think it's the former rather than the latter. The prices for the entrees are way too high for what you're getting. The value just isn't there for me. My friend says this is his favorite Mexican restaurant, so maybe this might be your kinda place."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant. Good was delicious and I had a pomegranate margarita I still think about! Marvelous!!  Service was great ... Must go!!"}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale on business and this was recommended as a good spot to bring our group from the office. We sat outside and it was really nice, the atmosphere was comfy and the music wasn't blasting so you could actually hear the people at your table.  Everyone in our party seemed happy with their meals. The guacamole was terrific and we all enjoyed our drinks (I had the white sangria which was pretty good). The food however was a little uneven. I had the crab enchiladas which were tasty but the sauce was so spicey it could have been any kind of meat in there. My friend has a chicken mole dish and she said the mole sauce was absolutely perfect. Someone had the shrimp cocktail which came in a gigantic glass, which was kind of funny (he said it was alright but didn't eat much of it).   I liked it enough to give it another shot next time I'm there."}
{"text":"I order a shot of tequila and it came with a little chaser that was amazing after I ordered a margarita that was delicious. The drinks are great, the prices are steep. The food was very over priced for what it was. I was unhappy with my entrees."}
{"text":"Fairly small place with limited parking in South Scottsdale.  Even though it is South Scottsdale you pay old town or north Scottsdale prices.  The chips and salsas that you get are substandard by comparison to places a lot cheaper. The food does taste excellent, however my wife's chicken came out very raw. They gladly took it back and gave us a free dessert for the problem.  If they had lower prices I would rate it higher but the prices dont justify a higher star rating."}
{"text":"My wife and I travel to Arizona on occasion to visit my daughter and Los Sombreros was a big favorite of ours. After a several year hiatus we returned and came back looking forward to another great meal. Unfortunately, it was only so so. From reading the reviews, evidently the husband/wife team here have divorced and the wife now runs this location while the husband has opened a new place in Sedona. We ate on the patio as always and both had the snapper fish dish. Previously it was a whole fish, now just a filet and nothing special. The chips, two salsas and guacamole wee great, everything else just OK. This restaurant always seemed to be a great example of authentic Mexican cuisine, now that best thing I can say about it is that's it's better that the national chains. Next visit I'll be exploring other Mexican restaurants in the area and hoping that Los Sombreros will return to its formal glory. Will also try the husbands place in Sedona to see what he's up to."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! It is not my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley, but it still has very good food and it is not priced too high.   The queso fundido and guacamole are great starters. I have tried a good amount of things on the menu, but my absolute favorite has to be the blue crab enchiladas. It was a risky move ordering them, but it was so worth it. I have been here a few times and each time I have to order them.   The margaritas are also worth a try. This is probably my second favorite Mexican restaurant after Barrio Cafe."}
{"text":"I must say I am slightly disappointed to see all the low stars. I recently went to dinner here with some out of town guests and my family. It was a bit crazy and busy,  so we got some margaritas at the bar while we waited  for a table. The margaritas were delicious- we each tried a few different ones, and all of them were delicious. As we began our meal we started off with chips, salsa, and guacamole. The guac was delicious and fresh, however I could have used a little more spice in the salsa. Also I was a little taken aback by the wagon wheel chips but after a bite or two, I could see why some people may enjoy them.  My one major gripe about this place was the fact that it seemed like our waitress disappeared for a bit. We had finished chips and salsa and our first round of drinks before she came back to take our dinner orders. I had the crab enchiladas. They were amazing. I also tried a bite of my dads seafood crepes, and now I know next time what I will be getting. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, and we took leftovers home, which were just as delicious. I would definitely like to go here again, but hopefully with better service. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I had not been to Los Sombreros since we first started dating and on a whim decided to revisit tonight.  After a horrible service experience revisiting Carlsbad Taverns earlier (*see review*), we were hopeful that our fond memories of Los Sombreros would hold true while visiting with our young son this evening.  From the moment we entered, we were immediately immersed in the warm and welcoming environment that we recalled: For lack of a better description it is relaxing yet vibrant all in the same and clientele are fed and treated like close friends and family.   The staff is extremely personable and gives the feeling that they are genuinely happy to have your company.  Our waitress, Miriam provided outstanding service and was genuinely friendly towards the three of us as well as towards her other patrons.  The food was just as delicious if not better than we remembered.  The highlight was the chicken chili relleno...Yes, we scraped up every last drop of sauce from our plate:-)    In spite of our adverse experience at Carlsbad Tavern earlier in the evening (*see review*) Miriam and the rest of the staff that assisted us helped to make for a night we will likely remember fondly for quite some time.  We will definitely be back to Los Sombreros very soon, and will make a point bring family and friends when they come to visit.  Thank you Miriam, chef and staff for a fabulous evening!  Sincerely,  Carolyn, Matt and Michael"}
{"text":"Love, love, love. Authentic Mexican Food. Great back side patio. Close to airport and Botanical Gardens. Still a drive but close.  Great waiter. I had the slow cooked pork w a mole sauce. He said it was a little spicy. I loved it.  Definitely going back"}
{"text":"I have to wonder if these good reviews are relatives of the owners of this place! EEEKKK WORST MEXICAN FOOD IN THIS AREA!  Met some others for lunch there.  Lunch time & literally no one else in there (bad sign).  Located in a very popular area but no one else there!  Waiter brings menu with dried food bits on it, yuk.  Six at our table & no one liked their food!  Tacos overloaded big time with white onions, meat tasted watered down with little spice, rice was disgusting, even ice tea sucked!  Couldn't eat anything after tasting a piece of the meat & one bite of rice!  Told the waiter food stinks & they still charged full price!  Don't go here!  Julio's Too is just right down the road from here & it has great food!"}
{"text":"Went to Los Sombreros beginning of April 2009 right when they opened around 5:00 p.m.  Had baby in carrier with husband.  We usually sit at the bar outside, but with the baby, we wanted to be seated on patio.    We ate chips and salsa.  don't like the little dorito wheels that come wedged in the chip basket.  The salsas are just alright and the tiny bowls aren't big enough for even the two of us.  Got crab queso.  It was good. We filled up on that and when my husband's carnitas (used to be our fav) came, so did the flies.  Yea, the regular dumpster variety.  ILK!!!!  We were surrounded by about 20 flies.  They were landing on the food and us, and biting.  The service was poor.  We finally got her to come over and we wanted to pack up the food and get out of there.  I had fish.  Oh yea, and a margarita.  They seemed  fine, but on we go...  The waitress noticed the flies and shooed them away while she gave us the \"to go\" boxes.  Our bill was about $70 with tip.    We didn't eat the rest of our leftovers that night.  But the NEXT night, we warmed up the carnitas and ate it up.  It seemed fine.  The next morning we woke up with severe vomiting and diarrhea.  This lasted for 2 days.  I went to the ER and had to get 3 liters of saline from dehydration.  Now, we think this all came from the carnitas.  Perhaps we should have not eaten it a day later.  Maybe it was on it's last legs the night they served it and that extra day...it turned bad.  We can't be sure.  Stomach flu has been going around so it could have been that.  Thing is, we both got sick at the exact same moments.  Hummm... Won't be going back.  Ever.  Sad..."}
{"text":"Charming little place, not very crowded and has a DELIGHTFUL large patio area.  A friend and I came here after a morning with our children at the Desert Botanical Garden, hungry and tired.  CONS: Only one person seemed to be working (around 2pm) and we had to wait to be seated and then for menus.  There wasn't a lot of menu options, especially for kids.  Slow service,   No chips and salsa unless you order it (even though the meals were really small).  Kind of pricey $10-$12 for 2 or 3 tacos and beans OR rice.  The kids meals were teeny tiny, and my daughter never usually finishes any of them.  She could have eaten 3 of the quesadillas, they were so small.  Good thing they were like $1.50 or $2.  They got the order wrong, I ordered beans and rice came.  When I got the server's attention and told him, he brought the beans right away.  PROS:  The food was delicious and unique, like nothing I'd ever had before.  I ordered the seafood tacos and they were great!  My daughter liked her quesadilla.  We felt welcome on the patio, even though we stayed for like 3 hours visiting.  Later when we were the only ones there, they didn't mind that our kids went and sat up at a high table by the bar and talked (but they were well behaved).  They were friendly and the place was charming and well kept.  Kids prices were great, but you might need to order 2.  I would love to come back soon but this time I'll order the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for a couple of years but remembered how good it was the other day when I passed by.  I was dubious of some of the reviews based on my experience, but hey, that was like I said a couple of years ago.  What my girlfriend and I experienced was fantastic food, wonderful service and just as I remembered it, a great atmosphere.  I had a tasty margarita, just the classic.  We ordered the guacamole to compliment our chips and salsa; which by the way comes with two salsas, one that is chunky and sweet with a small hint of heat, the other seemed to be tomatillo based and was equally good.  The guacamole was just as I remembered, chunky and delicious.  My girlfriend tried the Enchiladas de pollo.  She loved the flavor of the smoked chicken.  I had Puerco en Chipotle, which is slow roasted pork in a tomatillo-chipotle sauce.  It was darn good.  I didn't eat to much of my sides because I had consumed so much guacamole and the pork was just too good!  We were there on a Saturday night about 1900 and were seated immediately on the patio.  Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  Overall fantastic, just as I remembered.  Sure you may have to park on the street (we did); no worries, it's a great place.  ¡Buen provecho"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this place is awesome.  Very appropriate for a Mexcian restsraunt.   The food was amazing,  try the Lamb Adobo & Puerco in Chipotle ... they will rock your socks off.   The service was great as well."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was even better. My family went herein a whim and boy was it good. The owner even came out and talked to us. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"One of our very favorite Mexican restaurants in metro Phoenix, and an especially good place to bring out-of-town guests. The Mexico City-style cuisine is different from the more locally common Sonoran style, and delicious. Love to start off with that big tower of guacamole! They are also very attentive to food allergies here."}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale and was looking for great Mexican food.  I live in Boston, where we have great food, and even a couple of very good Mexican restaurants, but I figured that in the Southwest, Mexcellence would abound.  Boy, was I wrong!    I read all the reviews on Yelp of dozens of restaurants, and finally decided to try Los Sombreros for a late dinner on Friday night, Feb 6 2009.  I was in AZ by myself, so I figured I'd eat at the bar and get a great eye on how the place worked.  Many Yelpers mentioned a lively bar scene, Steve the bartender, his attentiveness & his margaritas, so I headed there hoping he'd be working.   Well, no Steve.  And my first disappointment was that not one Yelper mentioned that the bar is OUTSIDE!!  I know it's Arizona, but a cold front had come through & it was only 48 degrees.  I'm a Bostonian.  I'm not afraid of the cold, but if even one Yelper had mentioned that the bar was outdoors, I'd have chosen another restaurant.  The bar also has only 6 seats (well, 7 if you count the one where the pole in your face is closer to you than the worst seat at Fenway or in the old Boston Garden - that seat lacks bar top space sufficient to even hold a drink).  As a salsamaniac, I was looking forward to the salsa because so many Yelpers had raved about it.  People!!  When the salsa is a tomatillo salsa, you should at least mention that fact!  42 reviews and not one person thought to mention that the salsa is green?!?  I love tomatillos, but I was looking forward to a tomato-based salsa and didn't get one.  And as tomatillo salsas go, this was average, at very best.   I loved the fact that later in the evening, Los Sombreros re-activates its happy hour menu & offers a variety of plates for $5. That was cool, and I tried the guac & chips.  Again, disappointment.    The avocado had some brown spots and the chunks were so big that they snapped every single chip I tried to use to \"dip\" into the guac.  The only way to eat it was to use the fork to pick up the avocado chunks and put them on the chips.  I can't even say that the avocado was diced.  It was chunked, at best, so the \"guacamole\" consisted of chunks of avocado & a little seasoning.   And speaking of the chips . . . at even an average Mexican restaurant, I expect them to be warm & well-salted.  These were cold, slightly stale, huge and virtually salt-free.   I ordered a margarita.  At a Mexican restaurant, especially when I'm seated at the bar, I don't expect to see my margarita poured out of a pre-mixed bottle.  And I don't expect it to taste worse than the pre-mixed Cuervo margaritas we had at the last Jimmy Buffett tailgate.  If crowds necessitate making your house margarita in batches ahead of time, that's understandable.  But don't pour from the big tub for the people actually seated at the bar.  That's just dumb bar management.   My entree was a delicious sounding shrimp, tortilla & cheese concoction (I apologize for neglecting to write down its actual name).  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good, either.  It arrived looking like a Mexican shrimp & cheese casserole, with pieces of tortilla so large that two cuts of each tortilla piece were necessary in order to create an appropriately-sized bite.  The shrimp were delicious, but come on - how tough is it to cook shrimp?  The tortillas, tomatoes and cheese were messy & melty, but there was nothing special about the dish.  The strongest flavor came from the shrimp, and that should tell you a lot.   Overall, I felt cheated.  I wasted one of my few evenings in Scottsdale on Mexican food and a restaurant experience easily beatable on Route 1 in Medford, MA at anyplace with a sombrero you choose to try.    Seriously - steer well clear of Los Sombreros.  You can save a bundle by going to the grocery store & picking up some Old El Paso.  It won't be worse."}
{"text":"First, the stuff that cost them a star:  (1) I don't like the high tables. The chairs are so tall my feet dangle and I feel like Lily Tomlin. They were too busy to allow us to sit at a regular table.  (2) They won't do separate checks. (3) The chips came with only two \"wagon wheel\" chips. The second basket had none, so only half our group got to try them. The basket at the next table had a bunch of them.  Now, the good stuff. The food was very good. I ordered the green corn tamales. They were almost as good as the ones I used to get in Tucson. The others in my party also enjoyed their food. We ordered the guac and it was good, but the presentation piled it high in a mocohete that made it hard to get some on a chip without pushing the rest of the mountain over onto the table or floor. The two in our group that had margaritas said they were delicious, but friends who went the night before said their margaritas were ordinary. Portions were generous. I'm glad I ordered from the left side of the menu or I would have had to be rolled out the door."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food. Great bar area and patio... This place is always crowded around dinner time (not a large establishment), but sooooooo worth the wait.   I have tried several different things on the menu and I have been impressed each time.  Viva Los Sombreros!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. It was disgusting, my food was ice cold, and it was so over priced. The staff was rude and it was clear they were not following sanitary procedures (you can't hand a plate to someone they start eating it take it back and give it to another customer!!!) I would not suggest this place and I will never come back."}
{"text":"this was the first restaurant I decided to go too based on my fellow Yelpers, and I thank god I listened to them.   You barely notice Los Sombreros from the road, but don't let that fool you. This place has a great little patio with a super friendly staff and great margaritas. Couple that with the best guacamole in the Valley and great dishes like there enchiladas de pollo this is a cant beat place. Great for a chill happy hour.   why are you still here? go!....NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Great location, good food but the worst service I've ever experienced in a Scottsdale restaurant in FOREVER!!  Took 50 minutes to get our drinks. Food arrived before the drinks, and the order was wrong. When we complained to the owner, she never apologized, tried to throw our server under the bus - who was very nice and super apologetic.   Owner returned and literally threw some gift certificates at our table \"for next time\" and ran onto the next table.     It's so disappointing a great location, great restaurant has the worst service ever.  Even with free gift certificates, we won't go back."}
{"text":"Not impressed. We were told to make a reservation, which we did, only to get there and they didn't have our reservation. We were still seated inside. They keep the door open so we got to eat our meals swatting away flys the whole time. The waitress was clueless and not attentive. The food was just okay, nothing special. We chose to get dessert recommended by the waitress only for her to come back 15 mins later to say they don't have anymore. We had family from out of town and they were not impressed. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Worst. Mexican. Place. Ever.   This was the most over-priced, crappy food I have ever eaten in the Phoenix area.   When you walk in it looks legit and even smells pretty good due to the wood they use to smoke some of their chicken. Once I opened the menu, I could not believe it. I think the cheapest dinner item was over $16. I tried the carnitas, a Mexican staple and something I usually enjoy. Not this time. In one word BLAND. No seasoning whatsoever. No salt. No pepper. No lime. Nothing at all to make this meat taste decent. It was tender, I will give them that, but it was more like jello than pork. The texture was pretty gross. We also had to pay extra to get tortillas with the carnitas. Who the hell does not serve tortillas WITH their carnitas? Seriously....  The black beans were okay, the only part of the meal I could actually stomach. The rice was crunchy and bland. The salsa was bland and watery. Also, no refills on the salsa... Cheap bastards charge me over $16 for BLAND CRAP and cannot even fill up my salsa for free?  The service was bad, slow and aloof.   I would rather eat at one of the \"bertos\" instead of this crap hole. Honestly, save yourself the money and find another Mexican joint. I am in shock that this place has customers.  Not even deserving of one star. That bad."}
{"text":"First time back since the new owners opening.  The service was attentive but not overwhelming plus the server was cheerful and helpful.  A perfect blend.  To start there is a wide selection of margaritas and guacamole is wonderful.  The seafood tacos, picadillo chile rellenos and the smoked chicken enchiladas were all hits at this table.  To top the evening off a conversation with one of the owners was absolutely charming.  If you have not tried it lately put on your list to visit."}
{"text":"We had such a great time on the patio!  The food was wonderful and the service perfect.  Would recommend this place in a heart beat."}
{"text":"I tried this place after falling in love with the restaurant in Sedona called Elote. I found out the owner used to own this so figured what the heck.  Not quite in the same ballpark. But that could also be because he no longer works there and the foods were quite a bit different.  Very good mexican but went with too high of hopes unfortunately."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Mexican food.  Great outdoor bar with a great bartender.  Love it.  Try the shrimp fundido!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas and food. Love the patio. We live in AZ after all. We need to be outside. Last meal ordered there was seafood crepes and they are awesome. And try the guacamole. But be careful, with a few margaritas the bill creeps up there."}
{"text":"Really liked this place.  Located right off a main road as a stand-alone building I thought it was going to be a letdown.  Far from it.  Food was good as were the drinks.  Outdoor seating and bar are nice and the indoor seating is nice and casual as well.  Food was great- enchiladas were top-notch.   Portions were good for value.  Authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"Remember when I said \"don't miss the reverse happy hour\"?  Did you go? Ya gotta go! They're even open on Sundays and Mondays but the happy hour doesn't apply to those two days.  Looky- Here's the list of their  $5.00  Happy Hour Menu Tuesday - Saturday from 9-10 Friday & Saturday from 9-11   Only at the bar or the bar tables but the service is fast because Geoff & Steve kick ass.  Drinks  * Margarita with Chinaco Blanco on the rocks or frozen * Cuba Libre with Bacardi & Coke topped with lime * Mojito  * Sangria red or white * Montes Chardonnay glass * Gnarly Head red zinfandel glass * Shot of Tequila Blanco served with sangrita (that sangrita kicks ass!). Your choice of Tequila: Don Julio, Tesoro, Herradura, Tezon, Centenario, Chinaco, Milagro, Oro Azul, Tres Generaciones, Cazadores, Partida or Certeza. ** $2.00 XX Draft Beer  Food  * Guacamole, chips & salsa  * Black bean queso fundidio served with chips * 2red beef tamalitos * 2 quesadillas de rajas (mexico city style) * Shrimp cocktail with chunks of mango (To die for!) * Field greens chicken salad with lime vinaigrette * Watermelon & panela cheese salad * Jicama & orange salad with chile-lime dressing * 2 tacos dorados de pollo (plaza style) * 3 carnitas tacos with pico de gallo and homemade tortillas  Can you believe I memorized all of that? I'm like Rain Man.  Okay I lied. I stole the menu! Ha."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. We arrived a little early (5:30ish on a Friday) and thought the place was closed it was so barren. We had trouble even finding staff to get seated, almost left but I persisted and we were seated by a friendly host. Everything we ordered was delicious, the shrimp queso fondido is a must try in my opinion. Not a huge menu but I'm confident everything on the menu would be a hit. Chips and a salsas come out as expected and by the time we got our appetizer the restaurant had filled nicely to provide a much more normalized atmosphere. Portions were good sizes and the food was we'll prepared and tastey but you'll see the cost for it when you get the bill. That's really the only downside, I'd love to make this my go to regular spot but the price puts it in a once in a while treat spot. On our next visit I might try to order budget, it still may be just as great."}
{"text":"Great food and really good prices! Small and quaint!  We come here every time we come up from Tucson! And really good Margaritas !"}
{"text":"Honestly the best Mexican food in town. I grew up on the border and have a lot of family in Mexico. It is hard to find food this good even in Mexico. Try the Chicharron Quesadilla. It's not like most quesadillas at all, it has a mild savory flavor that is difficult to describe but I promise you won't regret it.   The Lamb Adobo was my favorite entree. It is a very large portion so come with an appetite. Oh and I can't forget to mention the guacamole, it's hard to get such a simple dish right but they nailed it.   All in all a great dining experience and this new location has a much larger indoor dining room for those really hot or really cold days when sitting on the patio is not really an option."}
{"text":"Staff and food were out of this world. It was a hole in the wall type of place. The people really care for the food and the people. The margaritas were really good. I don't normally drink but I just had to have one there! If you are a female experience the bathroom door.  We went back for a second time. Met one of the owners. On a Monday night by 530pm the parking lot was jammed! The waitress remembered us. The drinks were amazing. They have happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Got the recommendation from the concierge at the hotel I was staying at.  The food was excellent.  I had the carnitas, seafood taco appetizer, and guacamole dip.  The guacamole was thick and creamy with fresh avocado.  The onions, cilantro, tomatoes, and lime juice were blended well together for a a creamy and thick guacamole that was still fresh and bright in flavor.  The chips were sturdy enough for scooping while being thin enough that they were not overfilling.  One of the better guacamoles that I have had in awhile.  The seafood taco appetizer was excellent.  The soft tortilla was evenly made without a doughy taste or feel.  The ceviche filling had a great citrus taste without it overpowering the minced seafood and other ingredients.  There were no harsh onion notes.  Great appetizer, but a bit on the small side if you were thinking of making a meal of it.  Not sure what the entree looks like (just more of them or larger ones).  The carnitas were sumptuous.  They are slowly braised in oil leading to a soft and tender carnitas rather then a roast one.  While I do enjoy a good roasted carnitas with a good maillard reaction and crust this method was also very good.  Although it is slowly cooked in oil the carnitas were still had a strong pork flavor that shone through.  It was not overly oily or greasy.  I also partook of a mezcal that was on the menu, the particular one I had was recommended by my waiter.  It is a cousin to tequila but not cheap stuff from college.  It is served with an orange and spiced salt but the drink itself comes neat.  It had a wonderful smokey flavor to it with a great depth of flavor that made a wonderful complement to my meal.  All in all I would return to Los Sombreros if I am in the Scottsdale or Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Mexican food I have had in Arizona. When we first sat down I ordered a daiquiri and they returned 15 minutes later with what tasted like a strawberry smoothie made from concentrate with absolutely no alcohol. I sent the drink back saying that I had ordered a lime daiquiri and returned 10 minutes later with another nonalcholic strawberry smoothie. I once again returned the drink and asked for a lime daiquiri, and they brought back a half melted lime daiquiri. I normally wouldn't mind but when I'm paying nine dollars for a beverage I expect it to be up to par. The food was mediocre at best and extremely overpriced considering the quality. They charged $12 for three minuscule tacos that were dry and frankly the worst tacos I have ever had. If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. The waitress, however, was quite darling and apologetic."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years and love it.  There is not an item on the menu that is less than amazing and the Mexican chocolate cream pie is the most delicious thing ever.  Make sure you get an order of guac...yummmmmmm"}
{"text":"I got the pork chipotle and my wife got the smoked chicken enchilada. Mine was good, hers was great!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once was a solid 4-stars, the other, a solid 1-star.  I must add, the 4-star experience may have been clouded by their ($13) Patron Margarita.  First meal was a wonderful Carne Adobada with black beans and rice.  Meat was tender and juicy, sauce was GLUTEN-FREE and super tasty.  I thoroughly enjoyed this meal, however, the $16 price tag was a little steep.  My second meal was Carnitas and they sucked.  The pork was tough and lacked any real flavor and came topped with literally a teaspoon of pico de gallo leaving the plate 90% plain pork and 100% boring.  I do like the fact they have their gluten-free options highlighted on their online menu, and can provide that same menu in-store, on-demand.  I'm 1 for 2 at this place, perhaps I'll try it again, but if I don't, I'm sure I won't lose any sleep over it."}
{"text":"Last minute date night. We caught happy hour and had amazing food and drinks. The chorizo fundido, crunchy chicken tacos, and margaritas were perfect. Warm and welcoming staff, beautiful patio, and great food and drinks."}
{"text":"Los Sombreros is a nice casual environment with high quality food. The food is absolutely delightful and unique. It is most definitely not your average Americanized Mexican food. The happy hour specials are exceptional enough to create a possible regular outing to Los Sombreros after work, but what really is absolutely amazing is the Lamb Adobo. It's a delight and brings forth ecstasy upon every bite. The staff is wonderful and friendly as well."}
{"text":"I had the 10 course meal. $50. First let me say the service is always on point and that matters alot when you go out. Damn near makes up for the food.  Let me start by saying being the son of a mexican chef makes me very, very judgmental. But I can still be fair. The pozole was good. 3.5 stars out five. Good broth and meat. The hibiscus tacos were ok. 2.5 stars. Nothing you would order again. The fig and panela salad was good. 3 stars. Cheese and dressing were great. Shrimp and Papaya salad was ok. 2 stars. Shrimp was old (typical AZ shrimp) Salmon was great! 4 stars. I would order it again. Trout was ok. 2 stars. AZ Fish not very good. Stuffed chicken was great! 4 stars. I mean its stuffed chicken, how can it go wrong? Chile relleno with beef picadillo. Now the star of this show, 5 stars. The inside reminded of a desert they make in Sonora, MX. Its called capirotada. Its sweet and salty, maybe a hint a syrup? Pork loin. 2 stars. Not very inspiring Piloncillo Ice cream. 3 stars. It need something to cut the same flavor profile and make it a complete desert. Look, I know people say its great, but Barrio Cafe is way better with the same $$ point and flavor profile. I want to like it. I really do. But its not what it is cracked up to be."}
{"text":"So, if you're looking for traditional or gringo Mexican, I don't think this is your bag. But it was good for what it was! You've got to order the chorizo queso fundido and the shrimp dish with bacon. So yummy. Service was a little spotty, but a good vibe overall."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, nice location and decor. I love the bathroom door handles and counterbalance across from the kitchen - my wife loves the red ceiling and brick. Very trendy outdoor eating and bar area, lots of seating - but the bar is tiny, maybe five or six stools. The wait can be an issue, not a place to go if you are in a hurry or starved. Their guacamole is really good, but needs salt and they stuff the bottom of the cool rock bowl with tons of lettuce. The cilantro is a nice touch. Good chips and salsa, why do they charge for it when their entre's are NOT cheap. You pay for the name here, but the quality has not dipped over the years. Really good margaritas, again, a bit overpriced. I am a creature of habit, if I want something different I will go to another restaurant... I always have the Crepas de mariscos - fish/shrimp/crab stuffed enchiladas. Delicious spicy green sauce and the shrimp is NOT over cooked! My wife got the smoked chicken enchilada and liked it - pretty low key response for her, not blown away.   We will go back again, they are 'on par' with Frank and Lupe's which is further north in Old town, I think off Marshall. Nice to have two upscale Mexican restaurants in the same area - we gravitate towards Los Sombreros though..."}
{"text":"Yes, it is sublime. Dined here a few times. Outstanding margaritas.  The subtle touches one would experience say, sitting in a nice restaurant in Guadalajara, Mexico. Sliced radishes, real cotija cheese, mole, etc.   Do yourself a favor while the evenings are nice, bring the special someone or family and dine on the patio. Highly recommend the Quesadillas Mexico City style to start off; nothing like it in town and positively delicious with a cold beer or margarita on the rocks. And, we are supporting our local owned joints!!"}
{"text":"My visit to Los Sombreros was a wonderful meal overall. The building atmosphere is very authentic to the cuisine and the service is attentive. The menu is pleasantly concise and you won't have to worry about feeling overwhelmed choosing an entree.  I had the smoked chicken enchiladas, one of six or so meat choices, with rice and black beans on the side.  The meal came to the table after a short wait, occupied by a nice serving of homemade tortilla chips & house salsa.  Entrees came garnished with steamed vegetables and were hot and fresh.  I could definitely tell that the tortilla used for the enchiladas was homemade and the sauce was stellar. It was quite flavorful with strong cilantro and garlic tones.  If you do not like cilantro, you may not like the sauce, but I found it to be very fresh and zesty.  An experience well deserving of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Arrived early for a reservation and they hustled to get our table ready anyway. The rib eye tacos melt in your mouth as well as the seafood ones."}
{"text":"I ate here on a Sunday evening, the place was relatively busy but not as packed as I've heard it gets on Friday and Saturday nights. We were seated right away on the cute little patio outside, facing the back of the restaurant I might add, so you get none of the noise from Scottsdale Rd. They've really made the outside look quaint and inviting, both in the front and the back.   I was a little surprised to see the high prices on the menu but I think that's just because I'm skeptical of any Mexican/Southwestern restaurant that's expensive. I've been disappointed in the past. I ordered the Carne en chile colorado (chunks of beef in a guajillo sauce, spinach and potatoes) and after a few bites I knew I ordered the right thing. Although I have a feeling ordering anything on the menu would have been \"the right thing.\"   The party I was with all loved their entrees and we all enjoyed sipping our Patron Silver Margaritas. Usually I don't get too excited over Margaritas at a restaurant because they all taste the same to me but I especially liked that this one wasn't crazy-super sweet and that it was strong, of course. The sweetness can sometimes make me feel like I ate a bowl of candy but not these. I'm sure the Patron Silver had something to do with it too. ;-P  The service was a little spotty as our waitress didn't come around much and I asked for water I didn't receive. Although I  was already done with most of my meal before I remembered, and by that time it wasn't a concern. The  food was so good I didn't care."}
{"text":"Gotta say I'm very disappointed in our experience tonight.  It was if they didn't want customers, as the tables on the potion were dirty, seat cushions were up to the customer to go find for their chair and they didn't even bother to turn on the musters to help us enjoy our experience.  The waiter was very nice but it was if they didn't want to be open on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"We had a great family brunch on Sunday. They had strolling guitarist playing and singing Mexican songs and the service is always great. I had the ceviche which is so fresh and delicious and even tough it is an appetizer it is in a large bowl and great as a healthy entree. My husband the puerco en chipotle  which he loved and said the sauce was amazing. My Mom ordered the fruit crepes, other family members had the torta with chicken and vegi tacos. Everyone loved what they ordered. I have yet to order anything here that I have not thought was great. We will return."}
{"text":"After walking out of New York's Best we went to Los Sombreros. Great choice! Their Cadillac Margaritas are delicious.  My husband had the the beef tacos which was loaded with large chunks of tender beef. I had the chicken mole, best mole I've had. It comes with black beans, rice and mixed vegetables. The tortillas are all hand made with masa. Servings are large,  service is good and it is clean. Will return."}
{"text":"I was not that impressed. Ok, bear with me. Let me tell you a little story.   My family loves Mexican food. I think I've finally convinced them to forgo On the Border for some better fare. Well, since they were in the Scottsdale area one Saturday afternoon, I thought we'd try Los Sombreros. I said I'd meet them there. Good thing I brought the book I was reading (Summer People by Brian Groh - fantastic). My family was running late, and I discovered that it's a little hard to serve food when you're closed on a busy weekend day. Saturday afternoon? Closed? You're kidding me... Well, I took a spot on a bench and read. Lucky for me, I could text a friend to consider other possibilities in the area. Los Olivos was where we ended up. (Ugh. Don't get me started on that place.)   ANYHOW, I thought I'd give Los Sombreros another chance. I met my text-savvy friend the next evening for dinner. I arrived and snatched up a table on the patio. The hostess said it was the most popular table. Go figure, even if it's by all the little propane tanks surrounding the palms. I quickly ordered a Lager and drank happily while I waited. The menu presented a little bit of a challenge. Resist the amazing-looking entrees for dinner (and spare myself $17) or just splurge? I went with the fish tacos, since that's what the waiter recommended. What I got was not expected. Three mini tacos that were a challenge to eat. They reminded me of the signature dish you'd get at Pink Taco. I wasn't impressed. Later that evening, my tummy wasn't impressed, either.   So, would I go back? Eh. Maybe. I'd like my family to try this place during operating hours. If I go back, I'll get one of their more appealing dishes, like the lamb or crab. They definitely surprise you with their take on Mexican cuisine. I like the looks of the menu. I just hope not everything they serve leaves me wanting, like those messy, greasy and so-so tacos did.   3 stars for Los Sombrerors. 5 stars for Summer People."}
{"text":"Awful place... First off the wait took forever to get seated around 3pm on a Thursday. The hostess seemed unsimpathetic to our concerns. But we decided to continue on, the margaritas we had were way to heavy with the sweet and sour. The food came out 35 minutes after we ordered, again for the time it should not have been busy. The server didn't even apologize and as well didn't being the additional hot sauce I requested. In short, this place really isn't worth your time."}
{"text":"After a day at nearby Desert Botanical Gardens our large group was extremely pleased with our meal at Los Sombreros. Everyone from Grandma to the youngest (5 and 3 year old) grandkids, Omnivores and Vegetarians alike, loved their food choices and their selection. With a wide array of choices from pedestrian cheese quesadilla to adventurous huitlacoche (corn smut) pechuga rellena.  We loved it. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place and I'm so glad I finally tried it!  The patio is very nice and comfortable if you like to sit outside.  They have many choices of tequila, even a separate tequila menu.  The snapper ceviche was huge, fresh, and very yummy!!  I like that the tortilla soup was made with chicken broth, not creamy or tomato base.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Does Oreganos own this place too? (nowhere to sit, no parking, all hype).  Portions weren't very substantial considering the price, although the Chile Relleno I had over the holidays was decent, as was the queso appetizer - decent.  But this is big bucks, big wait, and it felt like I was moving through a small maze to get to the restroom.  Server had an attitude and neglected us at several points during our dining experience.  I hear about how authentic they are, but even if this is so, it's just not worth it.  Also, very few options for vegetarians, unlike most Mexican places which do have such options nowadays."}
{"text":"From out of the state, came to get some food, and was turned away because we didn't have a reservation. Hence there was nobody in about 7 tables at 6:05pm.  The host had no remorse or anything. She seemed clueless and had no help. No matter what, don't turn away business of any kind regardless of reservations being booked or not!"}
{"text":"Went here after seeing a positive review in Phoenix magazine. Did not disappoint ! We had the chorizo and black bean queso - seriously, possibly the best appetizer I have ever had. We both ordered rather eccentric sounding main dishes. I actually was presented a different meal than I had asked for, but when I tried it, it didn't matter! Everything about this place is great - the indoor seating area is small but great furniture and chandelier gallery. The outdoor area is nice too. Staff friendly and timely. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"A complete dump when it comes to lunch. The location is great, the establishment is cool... but the food... really... Sadly disappointed.  Expected so much more.... I mean... so much more.  WILL NEVER GO BACK!"}
{"text":"The Phoenix metro is all about hidden gems.  Anyone who hates the Valley because \"it has no character, everything is a chain\" just doesn't know where to go.  Los Sombreros is a prime example of this.    I have known about this place for a while but have never stopped in because, well, it doesn't have much curbside appeal as you roar by on Scottsdale Road in the XXX zone.   Shame on me.  I went this weekend and walking in the back was like being transported to a friendly cantina in Mexico.  The ambiance, service, and food were all delightful.  This is authentic/gourmet type dishes in a casual setting that includes an outdoor patio and bar.  The scale of the whole place is small and intimate.  I had seafood crepes in some kind of avocado sauce.  The plates around me looked equally delightful, from the traditional mole to the carnitas to the mango crab salad.  The pepitas crusted snapper is next on my list to try.   I'll be back again... soon."}
