{"text":"Best hot pot in Champaign Area. The bolus and shrimps are  so delicious, highly recommend~ Please try the plum juice and soy milk, they are amazing. The environment and service are great. It will be hard for you to find another place like this in Champaign."}
{"text":"The best hot pot in Urbana-Champaign area. Been there with friends last night. It was really awesome."}
{"text":"The spicy broth was absolutely delicious. Perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of heat and it went really well with the beef and lamb. The ability to personalize your sauce was great and quite unique.

Our waiter was very helpful, taking the time to explain the menu and portion sizes. The owner of the restaurant also took his time to come over and ensure we were enjoying our meal. The restaurant itself is very clean and well maintained.

It was a bit expensive as the bill for two people ordering Ã  la carte was ~$70 however I think the quality of food and service made it worth it.

Just two things to make this place even better, ice with the water and dessert!

Overall had a great, fun experience and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Best hotpot restaurant ever! Great food at reasonable price! Really enjoyed the environment and the service! If you are looking for a nice place to eat tonight, where else to go!"}
{"text":"The taste is really good and the environment looks fancy as well. Very nice and friendly waitress. Authentic Chinese hot pot."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Very cool dining experience! I came this noon, was noticed that they do special lunch offer. Broth and dipping sauce are all free!! Never thought could have such tasty food for around $18! My friend and I are so full. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money! Don't even think about coming!

There's not a single order that I don't regret ordering! The broth was so expensive and very oily. We ordered the pork balls which costs us $4 and what we got was a 5-half pork balls and tasted awful! Again, don't think about coming!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I opted for this restaurant for lunch. My husband ordered the herbal broth. I ordered the spicy broth at the spiciest level. The spice was disappointing. I was expecting it to be much spicier than it was. The sesame sauce was tasty. It was pricey for what we ordered but we still enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"The service is bad, that lady don't even know what a spinach is and she doesn't want to serve us all she does is sit at the counter and watch her Korean drama... The food taste worst and it's over expensive!!!! I rather make it at home and buy and ingredients I'm sure it will be cheaper!!!"}
{"text":"A very good and traditional Chinese hot pot restuarant. recommend the server Molly. She serves fast and nice. always know wht u want and need and serve it before u ask her. good server."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food here. It was authentic Chinese hot pot. One of the best Chinese restaurants I've been to. The decoration is classy and modern. Loved the experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed with my family in this place the food is nice our waitress is so helpful for us it was little funny I ask her about a food and am a vegetarian and she helped me a lot but some of my question is very hard for her and she called the manager or I don't know the guy comes and help me to get a veggie dish but the waitress service is so nice she teach me about a food you know am nepali indian and I really don't have that much idea on Chinese food..and food is good tho...me and my family enjoy a lot ...in shortly I wanna say the best chinese restaurant in champaign il"}
{"text":"Hot Pot Lab was a really fun experience. I really like hot pot in general so I already had a pretty good feel going into it. The restaurant itself is spotless and modern with a pretty good background track to it. Very important:the bathroom was also spotlessly clean. I felt the food was all very fresh and choice, good quality meats were used (beef and lamb). We got the spicy broth and it was DELICIOUS along with the sesame sauce which was equally as delicious. 

Our waiter was very helpful with how the entire process worked and was right on the money with suggesting how much of each--veggies, meat, noodles, etc---we would need to order for two people. Even better the owner came around and introduced himself and was very nice all around.

The only thing is that the meal was a little expensive; it was 70 bucks for two people so 35 each. That's a bit expensive for Champaign-Urbana but it isn't like Sakanaya doesn't have similarly priced food. I thought it was expensive but not so crazy I wouldn't do it again.

All in all I had a great experience. Great place to go."}
{"text":"This place really hit the spot.  my wife and I had the meat lovers and seafood lovers combos one with the tomato broth and the other with the house special broth.  the process is a bit unclear to first time guests (even first time guests with a bit of \"hot pot\" experience) All of the ingredients are good with the exception of the noodles which are GREAT!

There is always room for improvement for example the sesame sauce is a bit bland and old tasting and the waitress was unable to provide any kind of chili sauce which could have been a bit of help to the overall flavor.

Hot pot lab is certainly worth a shot.

Just keep in mind you are in rural illinois not a major city so don't set your sights too high."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. My husband and I each got the beef combo. It was a lot of food and definitely worth the price. After reading other reviews, we were expecting it to be super expensive. It ended up being less than $40 for both of us and that included beer.  I can't wait to bring others here. It's a fun experience with great food."}
{"text":"My brother and I got Szechuan broth, lamb, fish balls, Napa, quail egg, choy, mushrooms, and house made noodles. The hot pots are all individual sized, which is quite convenient. Great service, nice facilities.  Very tasty! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try this place because we'd never been before. I understand why it is expensive because of the cuts of meat and some of the other ingredients. The overall experience was okay. The service was mediocre. I did like that you each get your own individual pot with your preferred broth. We tried a lot of different things. I'd say my favorite parts to put in the soup base were the homemade noodles (which I recommend cooking for awhile in the broth), enoki mushrooms, thinly sliced beef, and the napa cabbage. Also, get the hoisin sauce and put a little on your noodles when you pull them out of the broth. I'm not sure I'll come back here, but it was an interesting experience. I also think that I've had better hot pot, but if you're really craving it and can't get to Chicago then this place is ok. Just pay attention to what you're ordering if you're concerned about price and pay attention to what your friends are ordering, some ingredients are shareable like the enoki mushrooms, the sliced meats, potatoes, napa cabbage, noodles. Remember, you can always order more, if it's not enough."}
{"text":"Definitely worst hotpot around campus. Small quantity, high price, bad service. Waiters there talked about and judged customers after customers left. They overcharged my credit card for 17 more dollars without explanation. I asked one employees there over phone and they insist that I went to the restaurant to ask in person. I went there twice and I regretted each time. Will never never go there again. WORSR WORST WORST hot pot around campus or ever anywhere."}
{"text":"Went to Hot Pot Lab with a group of friends a couple weeks ago. Food was fresh and nicely served. It could be quite expensive but you will end up paying less if you go there with more people. They have tables for four or six people. Those stoves were super cool. We can finally have a good hot pot in Chambana!"}
{"text":"Ouch, I hate to say this, but Hot Pot Lab isn't as great as when I first came, so I'm taking a star off. For my birthday, I came with a party of four since I was excited to return, and the five us had a fun time with the cooking experience, but otherwise, the service was shoddy. The waitress didn't give us the complimentary edamame appetizer, and she also didn't give us the plate of spices to mix with the sauces. She said Hot Pot Lab stopped doing that because it was a waste of spices to do so. I wish they'd at least put out a second menu of optional spices then. No one wants to eat plain sesame oil!! The waitress also had poor communication with us and we didn't get everything we ordered. We ordered 1 vermicelli and 2 house-made noodle, but we initially only got the house noodles and we had to remind her to get the vermicelli (because she already charged us on the receipt). We noticed they poorly portioned the house-made noodles and one plate definitely had more than the other. Besides that and vegetables (which they also skimped out on making it hard to share), we wanted 2 servings of lamb and 1 beef. Our order came and we only had 1 serving of meat given to us. She said it was lamb. We asked about the other meats, so she went back to the kitchen to look. I think they are either understaffed or the waiters had poor distribution of tables because she went to serve and seat other people and took a while to get back to us. This happened while 2 waiters were chilling around the door next to the kitchen. I felt bad for her! She finally came back to us and profusely apologized, then said they were OUT of lamb. That's fine, but you'd think they'd have a lot of lamb or buy more considering it's a popular item. So what about the beef? Well, it turns out, she said she made a mistake (and you know, didn't tell us), so we were actually eating a plate of beef. That'd be fine, but we had a diner who didn't eat beef - luckily she didn't touch it. At the end, we noticed that she charged us for 1 lamb even though they were out and we didn't even get it. That's a $8 difference! We also noticed she forgot to void the charge for the meatballs (we used a FB deal) and had to tell her. Overall, it came down to $15/person with tip included, so not bad! It's cheaper to buy ingredients from Amko and make your own hot pot, but unless you have your own burner, cooking it on a kitchen stove just isn't hot pot. 

As usual, the broths are really good and the ingredients are very fresh. I found out the Szechuan Spicy broth (at 2 chili peppers - the scale of hotness is 1-3 peppers) is RIDICULOUSLY SPICY. Like, I wanted to cry because I licked a chopstick dipped in it and it burned so much. Even the steam emanating from the pot is intense. If you really like feeling the burn, get this! 

Vegetarian note: ALL THE BROTHS ARE MADE WITH PORK BONES. They do offer specially made vegetarian-friendly broths (based from a normal water base with the spices added), so ask your server for that!

Side note: they have a deal where if you show the waiter you liked their FB page and checked in on FB, they give you a free side of meatballs of your choice! Limited time only."}
{"text":"I got in here last night around 9pm,  when most people are leaving. So I did not wait for long. There is nothing I can tell in the taste of their food, um, I can say it is the best hot pot taste in the area, and a fair price for a hot pot dinner as well. My other two friends and I are served really well and got free dessert as well. But there are not enough servers there I guess. I think I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"To Chinese readers. I would suggest prepare hot hot on your own instead of go to this place. Lamb and beef slices from Green Onion are far better. 

The good: clean and friendly stuff.

The bad: the sesome sauce has a strange sour flavor. Some meats are not fresh. 
Very expensive for a hot pot place."}
{"text":"As a 100% Chinese, I have two comments. The quality of the food doesn't worth you a try at any price. The price doesn't worth food of any quality. 
The seafood sauce was as sweet as BBQ sauce you find anywhere. The Napa cabbage was uncut in whole pieces with root. 7 dollar 5oz lamb has no fat.

I gave one star because I can't post comment with 0 star."}
{"text":"House noodles are excellent, definitely like the decor.
I've had the Szechuan broth and the tomato tonic broth and both were very good. 
The owner was very nice as well."}
{"text":"All I can say is ridiculous. 

for 2+ years on this campus, first time, ever, will never visit a restaurant again.

Ridiculously overpriced and not even authentic. well, maybe is only in chambana that this place will survive (not even 'survive', it's only opened for one month). at chicago chinatown you get everything better; better quality, quantity, service, flavor, more choices, at a much lower price. 

If you really wanna try authentic Chinese hot pot, maybe little sheep (unfortunately not in Chambana) pricier than AYCE hot pot but really worth the price. Chicagoland AYCE is great as well. Anyway way better than this. 

ps. me & my bf spent $35 here and we are still hungry. We ordered panda express right after and never though PE could be this delicious and fulfilling."}
{"text":"Girlfriend? Check. Ambiance? Check. Demographic mostly asian? Check. My girlfriend and I really, and I mean really, wanted to like this place. But we simply can't give it anymore than 1 star.

We came in around 9:00 P.M for their all you can eat, which is priced at approximately 23 per person. We sat down, told them we were going to do all you can eat. Fully knowing that we only had a hour to eat, they promptly took our order. Everything is fine so far, but then the experience dropped like an anchor soon after that.

(1) Waitress comes over and says \"Oh, by the way, we do not have any beef. Only lamb\" - Ok....  There lucky we both like lamb and were still reasonably happy at that point. Because any reputable hot pot business that has any sense of service SHOULD tell their customers that half of their meat for hot pot is not available BEFORE they start to order and its too late to negate.

(2) Our first batch of orders come in. Waitress says \"There were a few items on your check list that we do not have currently. So that is why if you checked them and they are not here, that is the reason why.\" - At this point i'm fuming but it was a happy day and we were celebrating so I let it go.

(3) Broth was standard. Nothing special

(4) Apparently they charge for the sauce. Ok, cool.

(5)  You could hear the servers gossiping towards the end about random stuff, and wanting to leave, instead of staying attentive to their last customers. We had to ask for water which at one point was almost completely dry in my bowl.

(6) Our final check came a little over 80 dollars. We both ordered a soda. Ok, I figure that's about 6-8. Sauce is extra, I am not sure by how much. Do they charge extra for adding more water? I do spreadsheet expenses everyday and it doesnt take a genius to know their were significant up-charges if all you can eat (23*2), soda (let's go high and say 5$*2), and sauce (I'm going to just say another 5 dollars. There was 20 dollars of up-charges on our final credit card statement.

For the price to taste ratio and for the simple audacity of business sense in not letting your customers know half the meat, and a significant amount of the other dishes are not available for all you can eat before they order... I would give this place zero stars if I could.

If I want great service, better ambiance, and ultimately the same quantity, I would take the 80+ I spent here (again how the hell did it come to over 80) and go to Sakanaya all day everyday. 

My biggest advice for those who are considering trying this place out is to make sure you ask them what they have available before you come in. I've worked in Socal for five years, and this place is embarrassing relative to the all you can eat Hot Pots there."}
{"text":"Been to Hot Pot Lab last night with family and friends. The food is fabulous! It was a very pleasant dining experience. Service is decent and friendly. 
A+ drink and food for a get together with groups of people. It has the most authentic Chinese hot pot around C-U area."}
{"text":"the service is terrible. I waited for 2hours. The point is it is really expensive. it does not worth at all. I do not recommend anyone come to here."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 3 late in the evening so it was quiet. The service was somewhat lacking, but it may be because they were closing down. I never got a water refill but they answered the rest of our requests in a timely manner! The spicy broth was very spicy for my taste, but after watering it down, it was very good! The price is very reasonable for the quality and amount of food that we got. Notably, the aesthetics were very good and the quality of everything was excellent! In particular, the napkins and the little plate and chopsticks were of very high quality. I would recommend this place! We appreciated that they asked us for feedback and suggestions indicating that they really valued our satisfaction."}
{"text":"Overall this place was a fun, tasty experience. The only downside was that it seemed a bit expensive, so I recommend checking the menu on their website before you go: http://www.hotpotlabrestaurant.com/"}
{"text":"Always go there if have a group of three or more. Quite good service and pretty fresh food."}
{"text":"Here it is. A rare 5-star review from me. I do them, but not often. 
So, we've seen several YouTube videos about hot pot and we've been wanting to try it for some time, but there are no HotPot places that we know of in our area. Visiting family in Urbana gave us a chance to visit Hot Pot Lab and we were not at all disappointed!
My wife and I shared an ingredient bowl and got the meat lovers which had a lot in it. I have an allergy to mushroom so they were able to modify our bowl to reflect that. 
The broths that we selected were the Tonic Tomato and the Szechwan Spicy Broth with the level 2 spice. 
The meat lovers bowl had beef, lamb, nappa cabbage, hot dogs, spam, and meatballs as well as seafood balls. 
We also got an extra side of meatballs for checking in on Instagram, so those were free. I also have always wanted to try lotus flower root, so we got that too. Those are amazing. Love the crunch, but they take the flavor of the sauces. 
Because of my allergy, they took out the mushrooms and added udon noodles, glass noodles and potatoes. 
The sauces are on a rolling cart where you can build your own concoction or just keep it stock. I used the sesame sauce which had an almost peanut flavor. 
The way this place is set up, each setting at the tables have their own burner with controls on the table face. 
Out comes your broth in a small stock pot and a bowl with your ingredients. 
You get your broth boiling then start putting your ingredients in to the stock. 
Everything from there is pretty standard. You cook your ingredients and enjoy! 
I have to say that this place is really good, our service was awesome and everything is clean and in place. Even the restrooms are clean. They are single use restrooms with locks. 
Overall, very very very good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am 100% Chinese, so I am qualified to review this place as the Most Authentic hot pot restaurant in town. All the food here are up to the standard of authentic, like those I taste in China, not mentioned fresh and clean. All the other restaurants in town offer hot pot could not provide food up to this standard. 

Based on my personal experiences, I like the tomato soup base. It brings up the flavor in vegetables. Bonus points for the soup tastes after cooking all the meat in there. Hot pot sausage is another dish you must try. The mini eggs taste incredible juicy after cooking in the broth and the egg yolk is very tasteful. I don't eat lamb personally but my friends like it a lot. 

For the dinning environment, I would say it is good for family, nice for a date and fun for group hang outs. It totally worths for the money you pay for. Servers here are very nice and the manager keep checking on us make sure we had a good time. 
Anyway, I would say Hot Pot Lab is a fun experience. It would be a good place to treat yourself. :)"}
{"text":"So, I think this place could be pretty awesome; however, there was one problem from the start: the staff did not speak English! Even though there was a picture menu, it made the whole experience difficult.  They bring you food, which you boil in an individual pot at your seat at your table, and then eat.  Because of the language barrier, I did not know how long to cook various items or ratio of sauces, etc.  Food was pretty good, but probably would have been better had I understood the process..."}
{"text":"Been to the hot pot lab yesterday, and I like it a lot. The only legit hot pot you can find in champaign Urbana area. Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"prefect food, fantastic service and even better experience of watching ncaa games while eating hot pot"}
{"text":"The spicy broth was delicious. Not many options on the menu and small portions. Overall, the food was okay."}
{"text":"This place had a cute ambiance and definitely had great tastes of hot pot. I initially ordered the mild broth, but switched after trying the spicy (the server was really nice about the switch). It wasn't long after we put in our order we were able to eat. 

So much food we actually over ordered, so I would suggest ordering a few things and adding on as you eat. We got the meat lovers and instead of lamb and beef we got double beef (again server was okay with this as well). The white shrimp paste was so good!! Good thing we didn't have to eat right out of the pots as it was very hot, temperature wise. I had to cool my food on the plates provided. 

The service was great and they were all more than willing to help us with anything we needed.  Will definitely be my go to hot pot spot!"}
{"text":"This was the first time for our group of friends and we knew we were in for an experience. Well, I am glad one of us did a little bit of research as the wait staff never asked if we knew what we were doing or if we had been there before. So, would suggest a little bit of it before going in if you are not familiar. 

The herb pot was good,flavorful and hearty; with the added veggies and meat it was really good. The rest of us got differing levels of the spicy pot and all thought it was delicious. The sauce choices could certainly be better; this was a stark contrast to research options on the Internet. 

The potato should go in first along with any root veggie as it takes longer to cook, but almost everything else besides the noodles don't take that long at all. One piece of advice, either hang onto your shrimp or use the ladle because if you lose sight or control of it they will be quickly over cooked. 

I'd like to rate this higher but the help/service was not the greatest...not sure if it is a lack of experience or what as we were the only group in the place for the longest time. 

All in all we would still go back, but don't have a group larger than 6 as that is the biggest table...guess you could split up your party but...."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here for lunch. We were the only people in the restaurant, which was fine. The food came quickly and was very tasty. The meats are high quality. This restaurant is on the pricier side, but worth it if you are really craving hot pot. Only downside was that the server was very distant and barely said a word to us. We had to hunt her down near the kitchen to order more food. Otherwise, I would definitely go back since the food was really good."}
{"text":"Too much white pepper in herbal broth. Stunned that they ran out of Napa cabbage after 2 servings. Meat (beef and lamb) wasn't sliced thin enough. There weren't many selections from all-u-can-eat menu, which wasn't cheap. Maybe individual order would be better?"}
{"text":"I ordered herbal broth with beef combo. Perfect portion for one girl. I really loved it. Good amount of meat and veggies. It would have been better if they used little better quality ham and sausage."}
{"text":"Food was not fresh....had to go to restroom immediately after I had the hot pot.. The service was great though."}
{"text":"When my friends and I ate here we all got  food poisoning. It was good but not worth the stomach ache"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place as the availability of hot pot in town is very scarce. The menu is easy to follow and has good variety. The waitress was extremely helpful clarifying any doubts on the menu.
The hot pot was decent considering this small town but the serving sizes where small and expensive. At around 30 dollars a person better food could be eaten elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's a great place to hang out with friends! The food material is very fresh, and there will be a very fancy surprise at the end of the meal!"}
