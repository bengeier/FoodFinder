{"text":"Very poor service and the food quality is below standard....there were food stains on the plates, half dry up shrimp head on the table cloth and we were the first customer on that table.  My 7 yrs old son asked me why the shrimp rice roll taste weird, not like the ones we get in Markham.  We couldn't eat another bite of the pork dumplings because the pork taste funny; WILL NOT RETURN"}
{"text":"Always delicious food. Service is a little slow but the food is definitely worth it. Highly recommend the sweet and sour chicken (served in a half pineapple) and baked spicy pork lion. Dim sum is amazing. Everything is priced fair w/ good portions"}
{"text":"First of all, the food comes pretty fast and it has enough portion. However is not the best Chinese that you can find. I wasn't expecting too much of this place. And I was right. I wasn't either surprise or disappointed. It was just normal Chinese food.  The service was ok. I mean how much can you expect. As long as the waiter understand my orders and bring me the right food I m satisfied with it.  I might go back. But it's not my favorite place.     A recommendation: do not order the crab. It tastes like plastic literally."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was busy. There was a line up at the door.   Food wasn't very hot.. Service mediocre.. I prefer Emerald on Eglington!"}
{"text":"Our family are frequent customers for both Dinner and especially during their Dim Sum period. On the weekends, get there no later than 11am if you wish to get a table right away.  The place gets really busy closer to the noon hour.  Food: The food quality and presentation has always been very impressive.  I have yet to experience anything negative with the food in general.  Service: I would say it is hit or miss...But mostly a Hit...Most staff are friendly and they have great memory as they do notice frequent customers. And then there are few servers/waiters that are simply so Unhappy and Grouchy....I say if you don't like it...Hide it...Or find a new job... Like I said, it is mostly a hit...plus a place that gets that busy, I am sure they are doing something right.  Price: a tad on the high side(still very reasonable), but for the quality of the menu items and the Dim Sum....It is worth it...  Tip: On weekends during Dim Sum...parking out front can be limited, so drive to the back of the restaurant where you will find ample of parking and a door that leads you inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, ordering from the carts is a breeze but the menu takes a while. Squid tentacles are great. My family and I come here often when there's nothing at home, because it's not overly expensive. Not the best restaurant, but by no means shabby."}
{"text":"We ordered three dishes. They were quite simple but the service was extremely slow, with the final dish coming over 1 hour's wait. The servers were uneducated on their own dishes. The first dish had its chicken cut up into such tiny tiny pieces, we didn't even know it was a chicken dish. The vegetable casserole had the vermicelli washed in a very metallic tap water. Then the Yin Yang rice tasted like the rice was at least a day old, and the sauces tasted like college kids made it on a budget with microwaved canned soup. And our waiter was no where to be seen after we made our order.   On the up side, we got 10% off  (because we paid in cash)."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed today at this place. We were the only people waiting for the next available table and the manager confirmed that we will be next when there's a table available for 4.  After waiting for 10 mins or so another couple came in and shortly after there's a table available. Manager decided to give the table away to the other couple because he knows them.  Really???  That's such a typical Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Classic Dim Sum place.   Had this for lunch and was impressed with the good quality and value for the price. Outstanding value for price as 6 people was about $100!  As with most similar places, there is a language barrier with the staff, but nonetheless, this is a great rustic spot that is simple and effective. Nothing fancy, but a great everyday place!  Will always be back."}
{"text":"This place is a hot spot for dim sum, and I can't say I disagree. They are one of the few Chinese restaurants still serving dim sum on carts, which is pretty awesome.  Recently I've found their quality of food lacking though - primarily dinner food. It's a bit disappointing because Summit is known to be one of the \"higher end\" Chinese restaurants in Mississauga. They don't seem to be as consistent as they used to be. However, this isn't to say the food isn't *good*  - it just isn't as salivatingly good as it used to be."}
{"text":"I went to this dim sum with my colleagues. At the end, one of the colleague decided to pay our lunch, in order not to let him bleed too much, we decide to divide the tips. JUST before I pulled out my wallet, this waitor came in checked the machine and ask my colleague (the one who  paid the bill)  \"Have u paid the tips?\"  The waitor was looking at us like we are the thieves who steal his money. At that time, not just me, everyone felt insulted at that time. Still, we managed to leave the tips on the table. Coz I believe every working waitor/waitress deserves the tips, because they live on the tips. Even the illegal workers. Right?   Me and my colleagues will NOT come to this place again!! Thank you, Summit garden!"}
{"text":"Sundays are for football and dimsum. And Summit Garden is a touchdown.  Getting here early is a must. Show up a minute past 11 and you'll be waiting in a line/sea of hungry dimsumers.   Once seated dim sum is all about position and getting easy access to  newest carts is the best bet for an enjoyable dim sum experience.   Shrimp haggar, curry squid, and baby bok choy are table favorites and don't be afraid to go peking duck.   The lazy susan at all the tables makes sharing or stealing your favorite dish away from others a breeze.   After a successful dimsum it's not recommended to drive so having a DDD (designated dimsum driver) is recommended."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner - just check to make sure it's not booked for a special function. Portions are generous and service is good except for 1 waiter.  Have gone there for yrs and have had many great meals."}
{"text":"Decent Dim Sum but insanely rude management.   Went there for the third time with a buddy and we were seated at a larger table due to no other table being available. We ordered and got a few of our dishes but as we were just beginning to eat the manager came over and told us we would have to vacate the table immediately due to a larger group having arrived. Seriously? We asked if we could be moved to another table as we already had food and we were told that we would have to wait at the front  for a smaller table or take the food to go. An atrocious way to treat patrons.   We got up and left without paying for the food we didn't even get to eat and the manager yelled \"You pay and don't come back!\" on the way out the door. Don't worry pal I will never come back."}
{"text":"Summit Garden has been around as long as I can remember. As a kid, I would look forward to having this special Chinese food that was different than what was cooked at home. It is a full service restaurant that is big enough to fit hundreds of people and it is very popular for special events such as weddings, Chinese new year, mother's day, etc.   Perhaps it is best known for dim sum on the weekends, as it is one of the few places around here where the ladies still push the carts. Arrive early or be prepared to wait!   Quality of food is very good but consistency does wane every now and then. We noticed they skimped a bit on the vegetables last night so I guess they are feeling the effects of the dollar too. The menu is extensive and easy to get lost in, so if you're trying it out, the set dinners are a safe bet.   Service is usually efficient and the friendliness will go up and down depending who you get. There is one particular jovial waiter who is all smiles and jokes around every time. Most staff have a Cantonese base with some Mandarin and/or English. Many Chinese and non Chinese eat here, so don't be intimidated. They are experienced in providing whatever you need if you are dining with children.   Bathrooms are somehow always wet everywhere and in line with usual Chinese restaurant bathroom expectations. One of the sinks in the men's room has only boiling water so be careful.   There is a loyalty card you can get that provides 10% off if you pay with cash. Tons of extra parking around the back and a side entrance that provides access to and from it."}
{"text":"Awesome dim sum and decent prices. 'Nuff said! :-) We're now rarely in Toronto, but when we are..."}
{"text":"I would give them a zero if I could. One star is an compliment based on their service. We ordered four dishes at 7pm then an hour later we found out that the dishes we ordered are not in the system. They insisted us to stay without any apology. The manager was extremely rude and impatient . The stuff act the same.  There are better restaurants in Mississauga . Stay away as you don't want to experience the event I did."}
{"text":"My family and I had a horrible experience at their restaurant on Canada Day, we are never going back. We ordered about $200 worth of food and service we received was just pathetic.   We ordered a full Peking duck (see image 1, from another Yelp reviewer Joe U) which was close to $40 and they only serve us very little meat with mostly skin initially and the server said they will take the remainder of the duck and chop it up to serve to us. In image 2 here, the center portion was all skin and there was no meat under that pile. Whatever you saw on the rim was the duck meat we got. So when the \"remainder\" of the duck came up (see image 3, from another Google reviewer Stephanie Huynh), they gave us minced pork in the center and there was no duck meat to be found and the duck leg and breast meat were removed from the bone but not in our plate. In essence, they stole that portion from the paying customer and stored it away in the kitchen for other purposes. In image 3, you can see the legs of the duck does not have much meat left and I sat there watch the waitress skin the duck for us and there was lots of meat left on the denuded duck's leg and breast.   The second thing that made us feel ripped off was the fish we ordered. It came in like it is on image 4. We asked why the fish looked like it's been handled and broken in half, the waiter said they removed the fish bone from the meat so it's easier for us to eat. However, as Asians who are used to eating fish on a daily bases, we noticed a portion of fish meat had been missing. This does not look like a whole fish before we even set our chopstick to it. The sneakily removed the meat from underneath the top layer so hopefully we won't notice it. I have never been to another Asian restaurant that does this, the act of removing the fish bone from the meat is just another way of stealing food from paying customer but making it less noticeable.  This is not the first time this occurred, my family doctor held a wedding here before and the restaurant was also cutting corners on the food portion. That was a huge embarrassment for that family on a very special day.   Another minor point that disappointed us is their after meal dessert. Usually Asian restaurants will serve some sweet soup or fortune cookie or just small candies at the end when we ask for the bill but we received none of that. Of course it is not mandatory for them to offer that, I am writing it just as another service improvement that they can consider."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a couple of times in the past. As I remember, my family and I would come here on Sunday for lunch. From what I recall when I was younger, the food was excellent, the service was great and the environment was modern.  Unfortunately it's seems to be a downhill slope. The environment is stale dated and the customer service is absolutely terrible. We arrive to an empty restaurant other than 2 other families, we were sat right in the middle. If you've been to summit you'll agree it's a large restaurant. I asked the manager if we can relocate, my mother is 65 years old and needs her space. The manager refused to move us. His reasoning was we only have a family of 3 and we're small, him being aggravated he picks up the tables and moves it closer to another family. I found this ridiculous.  Being Mother's Day, my mom was dead set on their lobster dinner here. We ordered the Mother's Day special, this included Veal & Carrot Soup, BBQ Beef, BBQ Chicken, BBQ Pork, crispy half chicken, 2 pound lobsters and a fish dish which I can't remember the name. Overall for food portions, quality and price... It was okay, the lobster was over cooked, the BBQ dishes were over salted. My mom enjoyed which made me smile, that's what mattered to me.  In the middle of our dinner, it started to get busier. We noticed the manager and an employee were arguing near the bar. If I understood Mandarin I'm pretty sure it was a lot of cursing. At one point, we thought the manager was going to hit his employee. The family beside us stepped in to tell the manager to calm down. Another family was recording this incident. I was too caught up in the moment. Pretty sure the manager just fired him in front of everyone. I felt bad, a child here was scared and crying over the loud yelling...  Overall Rating:  Food Quality: 7/10 Food Portion: 8/10 Service: 1/10 Environment: 1/10  I don't plan coming back. I hope the management can use this review as constructive criticism and clean their act up."}
{"text":"One of the only dim sum place in this area, and the though it's not the best I've had, at least the food is consistently hot and it's pretty much the only place left that still push carts of dim sum around. It's such a classic aspect of dim sum that's all but gone now.   Food is a hit or miss - I've had food which were cold and flavourless even at their busy lunch hours, and at other times it's much better and steaming hot.  No real pattern or indicators as to why it varies, but overall not a bad spot for dim sum in the area.    Staff are friendly and speak decent English. I see them having conversation with customers a lot, so they have pretty loyal patrons."}
{"text":"Not a good experience; i typically will spend about $70 at dim sum just for me; went there by myself and got a horrible seat in the back and not enough carts came by; asked for another seat and was told NO that this is where the single seaters have to go; the carts that did were come by were  Essentially empty so hardly had anything - no har gow, no shu mai - just stuff no one else wanted; literally spent $8 and wasted an hour of my time and left; service was bad and clearly staff don't care if YOU get food in their restaurant as long as they get the money; food was very slow and lacking but bill came in a minute;  should have eaten the bill."}
{"text":"Most of the times I've been here are with friends who know the owner, so I didn't realize the service is terrible for us regular people. But then again this is a typical Chinese restaurant :). We had family visiting, so we had a large party of family & friends. The moment we came in the general manager (?) was angry that we didn't answer his phone call despite being early for our reservation & then accused us of double booking (which we didn't). Some of the same food carts kept missing our section on all their rounds, so we had to literally chase them down or they ran out of a dish. Makes me prefer the places where you can just write your orders down. Food & selection are just average, but the squid tentacles & the shrimp rolls were tasty."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, great food and great price. Our family goes there almost every month and our relative and friends love there too."}
{"text":"Their Dim sum selection isnt so great and not that tasty either. Id rather go here for dinner, esp during Chinese New Year when they have the live dragon dance show on. Great Peking duck!!"}
{"text":"One of the above average Chinese restaurants in Mississauga. They host big events every year, such as Chinese New Year and New Years. I've seen Hazel McCallion for a fund raiser here before.   Staff that I've met here are friendly, most of them speaking Cantonese. Dishes are decent and comes in a large variety. A very family oriented restaurant and can be pretty loud during lunch and dinner hours."}
{"text":"Not too many places for dim sum in Mississaugs it seems.  This place was fairly busy on a Saturday afternoon.  Took a number and waited awhile.  Good variety of dishes although was disappointed that some of the fried dishes were cold i.e. trolley coasting for too long.  No dish was memorable. Ok for dim sum fix once in awhile."}
{"text":"Good solid dim sum.  Like the fact that they still have the carts.  Not too many places around that do it. Staff was friendly.  Only reason I'm not giving it four stars is because we ordered shanghai style dumplings with the soup inside but they were pretty bad.  But if you're looking for Hong Kong style dim sum this place is great."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  I went here for an event in their private room where the family had ordered a fixed menu, so I had little choice in the options available to me. There were about 12 dishes served in total, which I could only eat about 5. Most items are either battered and friend or they use soya sauce.   Here are the items I ate:  - suckling pig and roasted meat combination platter - sauteed chicken and beef in phoenix nest (the nest was made from taro) - sauteed snow pea sprouts with king oyster mushroom - fried rice with BBQ pork and shrimp - red bean soup (dessert)  I did not have any reactions to the food. It was tasty and pretty standard for the price point of this restaurant.   TL;DR some gluten-free options but most are not"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the food or the establishment. We came on a Saturday evening. One of their VIP rooms had lion dancers with drums to do a performance. It lasted around 15 minutes. Normally you'd be happy to see a performance right? Well not when their drums are deafening and when it's not directed at you. I was amused for maybe 2 minutes. Then it changed from a feeling of  \"cool\" to annoyance. The fact that the management allowed the VIP guests to do a performance that disturbs the rest of the patrons is pretty inexcusable in my opinion and I'm not even that picky about this kind of thing in general.  The food was \"ok\", except that it took forever to bring to our table. After the peking duck, we got nothing for maybe 45 minutes. We were hungry. Taste wise I think the food ranged from \"as expected\" to sub par. The lobster head a big head but the body parts didn't seem to correspond to the right size. Did they use a big head and mixed other lobster bodies together? The lobster we got as the \"fried\" style and it wasn't as flavorful as places like Blue Lagoon or Yu's Seafood. Portions felt kind of small, especially the steamed fish. And prices were not cheap.  I will not come back."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in Mississauga ! I've been searching for a good one for a while.Friendly service, speak English. Much better than the place at Hwy 10 and Eglinton."}
{"text":"Dim sum was ok. I think they put a lot of MSG in their food, felt so dizzy the whole day after and my stomach did not feel great.  They had push carts which I'm not a fan of, all that talking into my food.  There may have been some food that had been sitting on the cart for a while, they offered to rehear which was nice but how long has it been sitting there??    Too bad, I was looking forward to this place after looking for a dim sum place in Mississauga!!"}
{"text":"SERVICE We ordered service water 3 times (within 40 minutes) before we were given any. My father ordered bottled water within that same time, and he was given one right away. Our group ordered more than $200 worth of dimsum, noodles, chicken w/rice, etc. The food came without much of a wait.  FOOD The rice in the chicken dish was flavorful. I liked the taste & texture of the taro cake too. Overall, the food was good, similar to other Chinese dimsum restaurants.  AMBIANCE Looks clean enough, although there are some old food stains on the wall.  Slight smell in the restroom, but there are usually many people eating here. Expect long waits during busy periods (we experienced one during weekend lunch)."}
{"text":"Had to feed a craving for Beef with flat Rice noodle in Black bean sauce! So hubby gladly met me here for dinner midweek after work. Not too busy at 6:30 but tables quickly filled up!   Ordered snow pea leaves in garlic sauce. Looked really fresh and that nice shade of green you expect when it's sautéed just right with a perfect sprinkling of Sesame seeds and some little dried flakes of garlic?  Normally I find the service kind of nonchalant and lacking here but today the waitress was quite attentive coming back frequently to check if we needed anything else.  Upon finding out I'm Korean, she seemed to endear herself to me --who knows, maybe she likes Korean dramas! That seems to happen a lot these days with the current obsession of all things Korean...  I was a little disappointed with the Beef rice noodle dish as it didn't have enough sauce to cover the rice noodles. At least the green peppers weren't overlooked and still held a slight crunch.   At the end of the meal, we were surprised by the sweet soup of papaya (looked like carrots to me) and a jelly like vegetable (maybe mushrooms?). I prefer the red bean soup most Chinese restaurants serve at the end but dear hubby says he prefers this type of dessert soup. I can pass...  Honestly, the only reason we came here tonight was because Perfect Kitchen was closed (usually closed on Wednesdays) as we find their prices slightly higher than other Chinese restaurants and dishes slightly bland. Although I do like the ambience and cleanliness a lot more than most other Chinese restaurants. It's the kind of place you'd want to bring out of town guests or have large family gatherings here as they use real napkins, real tablecloths (not the plastic variety), and a banquet like feel to their decor.   The manager or head waiter always seems too distant and cold never cracking a smile. He's none too friendly--not a good quality for someone who is their front line customer service man! Oh well, once in a while we'll come here but only if our fave spot isn't open."}
{"text":"Came here for my cousin's wedding dinner. Seems like a very popular place among the folks living here.  There was us, plus another wedding part, and regular non-chinese.  The rest of the restaurant was ten over by a large anniversary celebration. This definately seems like the place to be some how.   The food here was pretty good. My cousin also did a good job of hand picking the dishes.   My favourite was the soft shell crab.   They also have an interesting way of presentation, like the chicken that was cut with the head and tail added (custom) but looked like a flat chicken. Or the weird egg garnished we all picked at.   The service was unfriendly and sometimes rude. They were strange about taking away the food, and clearing the plates. I don't' know who would win in terms of mean service staff Emerald or here"}
{"text":"Came here for a family dinner and ordered a typical Chinese restaurant 10 course meal.  Restaurant is a lot more big and spacious than what it looks to be from the outside. Although it apparently been in business for 15 years or so, the decor doesn't look too dated like many Chinese restaurants e.g. worn out chair covers and carpet, or tacky red walls. Actually, with their light green and oak colors and circle mirrors and door windows, makes me feel like I'm dining on some cruise ship :)  Food ============ Although the dishes we ordered were typical at Chinese restaurants, the quality for most was excellent. Points for delivering traditional and familiar dishes well. Portions was fair and dishes were fresh and tasty. I especially love how they made extra efforts with plating and preparing the garnishes. They sliced a LOT of cucumbers up and arranged them neatly around every single plate:) If it's not cucumbers, it was something else like carrot roses. They could have just thrown on a parsley or green onion bits. The effort does show they cared about what they're presenting to you.  The only dish I didn't like was our fish. There's always a fish dish as part of the 10 course meal and the cooking style and type of fish depends on your meal price. Our fish dish was a fresh whole fish that was fillet into pieces and served like a bird nest style dish. They took the remainder of the skeleton and fried it into a bowl shape to hold the fillet pieces. This was the first time I've ever came across this serving idea and really admired the creativity of it. Unfortunately, though the skeleton was meant to be eaten and bones was brittle enough to eat (like soft shell crab or sardine), the skeleton was just overly greasy.  Manager came by to up sell their fresh oysters and we ordered 8 in garlic and green onion style (other choice was black bean, never raw in Chinese restaurants). They were really fresh and steamed well in gigantic shells.  Service ============== Here is where they really stand out. I'm not sure if anything have to do with the host/my aunt being just a regular dim sum customer but the staff and service was very attentive. They give new plates for every course, was gentle in their serving manner, be sure to give you extra dry and wet napkins for lobster eating. The staff weren't too loud or tossing used dishes into bins loudly. Just overall friendly and never rushed and hasty like many other Chinese restaurants. Our server name was Jennifer and although I think she's somewhat new to the job or serving, she did a great job. Maybe its also because she's new that she was taking extra care in doing a good job.  Coming from the Scarborough/Markham where there's an abundant of Chinese restaurant, I didn't expect to be actually impressed by one here in Mississauga. My sister is on the lookout for a Chinese restaurant that's actually not dirty, dated and tacky for a wedding reception and she's would actually consider dragging the family to this side of town just because they're actually clean/decent looking, serves good food, have good service, and fairly priced. Not an easy combination to find among Chinese restaurants.  Do look forward to coming again for dinner when visiting Mississauga."}
{"text":"I'm new to dim sum, so I'll keep this short and sweet.  First of all, this place is HUGE. We were seated and had tea within 4 minutes of sitting. I like that. I did however, feel like someone was going to get up and do a speech any minute - as the dining room is banquet hall styleee. I kinda felt like I was at a wedding the whole time. A Chinese wedding? I don't know, but someones wedding.   ...And I like dim sum. I've been to Summit Garden twice in the past month.  I have to literally starve myself to be able to go... or at least have 3 people in the party or you don't get to try as much as you like.   The portions aren't as little as I thought they would be,  but I liked pretty much everything I tried.  I felt like I was being bombarded with servers coming by with carts and carts of food. I didn't know what to try, so if it's your first time, PLEASE go with someone who knows this place. It can be very intimidating if you don't.  I think we had 16 dishes last time, most of them large.. and it worked out to like $30 a person (3 people) Not cheap, but I guess we ate a lot.   I'll definitely go back but with more people.. I don't mind the atmosphere being busy and banquet-like and the food was hot and tasty. I'll have to try more places and re-comment on this in the future.   Ooops, not so short and sweet. Gah!"}
{"text":"Standard dim sum place. Nothing spectacular but certainly worth trying. The dim sum carts come out quite frequently. The service is polite and they are quick to replace empty tea pots."}
{"text":"I've been coming here ever since it opened, which I believe is close to or maybe over 15 years. When it first opened, it was very clean and the carts would come by very often.  They've undergone various changes in management, cooks and ownership through the years and with that,they've fluctuated between extremely good and frustratingly bad to mediocre.    So why do I still come here?Because it's the only large dim sum place close to my mom's place and we have a VIP card that gives us 10% off (another change - this card used to be 15% off). Now the dim sum here isn't bad, it's just that is very limited selection as it's your standard har gow, siu mai, steamed buns, rice noodles, chicken feet, beef balls, a few meat pastries and that's about it.  You can be here for about an hour and these carts will come by at least 3-4 times.  There's nothing really special about this place and I wish they would come up with more creative and unique dishes or at least have more selection.  Sometimes, if it's not busy, you can be there for an hour and have the exact 2-3 carts pass by you all the time.    I'm not sure what happened to this place, but I always dread going here and the only reason I go is because family wants to (sister and niece).  If it were up to me, I would most likely not take my friends here.  Also, can be crazy lineups on the weekends."}
{"text":"This is truly amazingly bad restaurant on many levels.  My wife and I went for dim sum and everything we ordered was mediocre to atrocious.    I can describe in many words but I will keep it short: 1) one of the dishes we ordered was rice noodle (or something like it) with beef inside 2) when the dish came out, the meat was pink, 3) we called the waiter to let him know so he can address the issue.  He was a tall and skinny guy.  4) when the waiter came, he non nonchalantly exclaims - beef is eaten pink, that is fine.  He walks away after his daring comment.      FYI, other dishes that came out sucked big time too - how can you mess up chowfun so badly?  Need I say more about this place???  If you venture out to this place after reading my review, you deserve what you will get.  To be fair, I heard a good comment about this place from someone I met.  Maybe it used to be a restaurant that treated customers with respect and care at one point.  Now, this place needs to be converted to a car wash.  Walking out of this place, I told my wife - the most I would pay for the food I just ate is $1.99, and that is,  I would only with much self loathing, as I would have been better off making me a sandwich at home instead of eating at Summit Gardens.   Best of luck diners!!!  Billybob"}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite Chinese restaurants! Sure, prices maybe slightly higher than some other Chinese restaurants, but you get what you pay for. (Eh. Cantonese chowmein $15+ Dim sum on weekends is always busy. You can make reservations though  Update : I've recently noticed that Alot of the dim sum have a ginger taste that I'm not find of. Price expect $50+ for 4 people  Quality of all other dishes is great! I would definitely recommend anyone to try this place Service - 7/10 The lady pushing the cart didn't know what sweet and sour sauce was though.  even after telling her it's the sauce that goes with chicken balls."}
{"text":"Lunch and dinner, night and day, literally and figuratively.  Suburb style but Chinese authenticity.  My first visit was a quiet dinner with only a few other occupied tables and a waitress that didn't even know I could get herbal chicken feet soup.  Duck, beef, chicken, bring it to my table.   During the day every table was filled and it was lively in this large expansive, impersonal conference like room and dim sum carts rolled by offering their wares.  The simple peppered short ribs were amazing; I could eat several bamboo baskets of those. The taro nest had a delicate nest coating and flavorful taro inside.  The barbecue chicken feet were  of course as tasty as anything that looks barbecued infant fingers could be!  Scallop, pork and other dumplings were great too!    I'd say the interior design is lacking, the cards mostly kitchen dish carts, etc. even though some of the staff is dressed nicely, etc. but we're here for the dim sum and that's enough."}
{"text":"Used to be good 10 years ago until recently (2013-present) frequent visits all left us with the same souvenir, tummy-aches after we got home.  Lots of Chinese celebrations here for mid-summer autumn and the new year. Is always booked for parties.   Large selection of food and drinks. Decorated western-styled. Parking is a breeze."}
{"text":"This is our favorite dim sum place in Mississauga. Great quality food, lots of variety, and cart service. Very authentic and traditional dishes, as well as something new now and then (like green tea sesame balls). Love it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty good and is not that expensive. Sometimes it does get busy so you may want to reserve ahead of time.  Remember to order the  deep fried salty and spicy squid."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the restaurant for years. One of the better places in Mississauga to get dim sum and worth the drive from Oakville. Inside is like a classic dim sum restaurant but it isn't as packed as other locations get. The average wait time is about30 to 45 mins during peak hours. If you're in the area and want some dim sum come try this place."}
{"text":"Food was served timely and hot.   Arrived when they just opened so the AC was just turned on.  Pay at the \"table\""}
{"text":"Service wasn't that great but then again it is a real Chinese resteraunt Food was your standard Chinese food.  Can't complain about it Prices was reasonable.  I would go back when I have the craving for Chinese though"}
{"text":"I love this place. Am here at least once a month!  Grilled calamari  Pork buns Eggs nest Grilled meats And so much more  So fresh Amazing tea  It's usually cold in here so dress warm"}
{"text":"The BEST chinese restaurant in Mississauga close to Oakville area. Food is authentic Hong Kong Cantonese style with some fusion dishes the owner and chef created for modern day Asian cuisine.  The food quality-is the best you can get from a Chinese restaurant.  Items are always freshly made and made with quality ingredients.  Surprisingly good wine selection at the bar. BBQ suckling pig is delicious and crispy, taro nest dish with minced beef extremely tasty, and steamed fish always fresh. Although the decor is a little dated but it has a nice fine Chinese seafood restaurant ambience. The chinese sticky fried rice is the best in GTA.  Definitely good value for the food!  A must regular visit."}
{"text":"1 hour and 25 minutes for 7 dim sum.. a complete disaster today. Cannot even enjoy the food when it takes so long"}
{"text":"****2.5 Stars*****    Oh Myyy....i never knew a place can get so packed and busy...damnnn I shouldve read the tips here on Yelp (silly me). That being said i highly suggest you call ahead and reserve. I came here on a weekend and had to wait about 30 mins to get seated.    When we did get seated and ordered some food, we noticed the food came reasonably fast considering how busy and packed it was. Our server was really nice and fast. What i liked was that the manager came around the tablea to ask if everything was okay and if we missing anything. Our food was alright ordering rice with sweet and sour pork and won ton soup. I am going to say that the prices are not cheap. I noticed a lot of people like their dim sum, although i have not tried it here...yet. Id probably try it again for the Dim sum because its not far of a distance for me, Although i think id rather go to Emerald on hurontario and eglinton."}
{"text":"Food here is great just as long as you can grab a seat.  The maitre d was atrocious.  Never coming back here."}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us treated to this hidden gem by one of my Chinese associates who lives in this area. What a treat! Had the Crispy Duck (Christmas Story, \"he's looking at me\"... Lobster and Lettuce Wraps. Truly authentic Chinese cuisine! I will be back! PS: It is much larger and nicer than appears from outside."}
{"text":"Wow, in you are not Chinese they ignore you. I'm about to leave. I've been sitting here at a table for 10 minutes and \"No\" service?  I'm leaving now!!!"}
{"text":"They kept catering to Caucasian people. And seven dishes came up to $30 after taxes. Too expensive. The host was swearing and complaining about how much he hates the customers.  Overall, over price!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum was really bad!  We were there early, got a few dim sum from the cart, the inside of the shrimp dumpling was COLD!  How do you mess up shrimp dumpling at a Dim Sum restaurant.  Then I tried the shrimp rice roll, again, COLD inside!!"}
{"text":"I came here for Father's Day lunch with my family yesterday. Let me start by saying that a reservation was made a few days ago for 12 pm for 12 people but we weren't seated until half an hour later. I understand that on occasions like Father's Day, it can get very busy but the restaurant seemed very short staffed since all staff seemed to be scrambling around the restaurant throughout our lunch there.  The restaurant had some nice decorative ceilings with chandeliers and it was brightly lit. The tables and chairs are too close together though, making it a headache to get in and out of your seat. The ambiance was just non-existent. I know better than to expect much at a Chinese restaurant but this was one of the worst layouts I've ever seen.  Then, there was the wait for our food to arrive....I wouldn't mind the wait if it was worth waiting for. Unfortunately, it wasn't. We ordered egg drop soup, sweet and sour chicken, grilled fish, fish with a corn sauce, Cantonese chow mein, chicken wings, veggie spring rolls, steamed veggies (snow peas, mushrooms, bok choy), eggplant with shrimp, and finally, veggie fried rice. Some of my family members asked 3 times about the fried rice throughout our first hour there, which of course came at the very end of the meal when all of the other dishes had already arrived and most were finished.   The portion sizes were all good - no complaints there but I can't say that I really enjoyed any of the dishes that were ordered as they did not look appetizing to begin with (only the sweet and sour chicken in a pineapple did) and it was even more disappointing to taste how bland everything was. I pretty much ate to avoid being hungry.   We had no issues when it came time to pay the bill of course. Since it was Father's Day, I paid for half of the bill along with some other family members but I feel like it was a rip off. We could have and should have gone elsewhere for lunch for the amount that was spent. Unfortunately, this is one of the few places that I already know that I won't be coming back to."}
{"text":"Came here to try the Peking duck and other dishes with my family. Left with one of the worst experiences at a restaurant. Peking duck came out fine after 30 min, not truly that great just slightly above average. Then 45 minute wait later after politely signalling we were still waiting for our food. The waiter tells us our food is on the way yet the tables around us who ordered almost the same meal yet after us received all their food. We finally got fed up, paid for our Peking duck and left. The waiters were very obvious in avoiding us, and walking away hurriedly when we asked for our meal.   I will not be returning, they honestly do well simply being the only Asian restaurant in the area.  Horrible service."}
{"text":"Maybe 2.5*  I hate dim sum.  Ok, lemme clarify that, I hate dim sum in Mississauga and certain parts of TO.  Having said that, I have yet to experience dim sum in Markham/RH, proper!    I especially dislike it when non-Chinese friends suggest dim sum and I happen to be 1 of the few Chinese people at the table.  Inevitably, I'll get annoying questions like, \"What's good here?\" AND people ordering crap that I would never eat/\"big dishes\" that cost like $6...that I would never eat!   Having eaten dim sum in HK, it's safe to say that the 'ssaug is probably one of the worst places in GTA-west for our version of tapas!  (Oakville/Brampton is not even in the race!)  Dishes are most likely double-steamed/fried and in general, not as fresh as it could be.  And as to whether or not most places have an actual dim sum chef?  Who knows!  Summit Garden is considered one of the better places in the city for ds and despite the crowd waiting outside, it's pretty mediocre at best.  Setting is nicer, with white table cloths, waitstaff in uniforms, high ceiling, but take that away, and the food is just ok.  It's edible, but I don't really enjoy."}
{"text":"I don't usually go for dim sum but I know that at most places, there are lots of employees pulling trollies with food inside and you would have no issue getting food because there are so many of them walking by.   Here (at least when I went), there were literally one and sometimes two employees going around with food. The tables in here were all filled with people so everyone was just waiting for those two employees to pass by their table to order. I don't know if they just didn't cook enough food or if they were understaffed, but having only two workers at a time in a busy place like this isn't going to work. After a while, people were getting up from their tables and walking across the restaurant with their order sheets straight to the employees pulling the trollies just to get some food. That was the first time I've been to a dim sum place where the diners are going up to ask the employees for food instead of the employees going around offering diners the food in their cart.   So, we had to wait quite a while in between each dish because we had to wait for the one to two employees to make their way around to all the tables... and the food is mediocre at best. Not a good experience and I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Average dimsum restaurant. The food comes around in carts,  some got cold for being left there for too long. Decent selection, you can get all the common dim sum dishes."}
{"text":"We came in for dim sum today. I heard the ownership changed about a year ago.  Dim sum service was hit and miss.  Some of the wait staff seemed a little cranky.  Some of the cart servers ignored our table.  Their loss cause we probably would have ordered more.  Some of the dishes were cold eg shrimp rice rolls and pan fried dumplings.  Only good thing about it was the price was quite reasonable"}
{"text":"FIRST STOP IN CANADA, WOOT WOOT.(?  ?) We came here on behalf of our relatives during rush hour and boy was it packed. Nevertheless we got our seats quickly despite having a party of 16 people. The dim sum itself was good and quick to come by, but service was a bit slow when asking for refills and extra utensils. In conclusion, this restaurant is good but nothing extravagant"}
{"text":"To get a good seat & avoid the crowd when going for dim sum on the weekend, go before 1:30pm... I find that it usually gets really busy after that. The cart ladies are really good at telling you what's on their cart but there's one guy who is there who won't tell you what's on his cart - he reminds me of Kevin from SinCity.... Try to avoid ordering rice dishes or noodle dishes during this time because it will take awhile to come out. Peking duck is really good but that does take awhile as well - I know it's Peking duck & all but it does take longer coming out at this time rather than other times of the day.. Their House Fried Rice is light and refreshing, it's not coated in soy sauce but it's still flavourful and you won't feel heavy when you eat it.."}
{"text":"Like all the other reviews I saw, after going here today it's true that the food is pretty decent but the service is kinda sucky.   It was going better than I expected at first, but when we paid for the bill the guy who accepted the money had the most unpleasant look on his face, which made us a little sad. Hahaha otherwise it was a pretty decent place to go!"}
{"text":"I found this place on a food blog and wanted to check it out. Was looking for a cheap dim sum place with good food and ambience. Bonus that it had easy parking.  Wait on a Saturday at 1pm was about 10-15 minutes. Not too bad. We left at 2:30 and there was still a steady stream of customers and wait. The staff gave us a number and were very prompt to clean tables and get people seated.  Different staff took our order for tea and set our table. Tea came quickly and throughout the meal they came to refill our pot.  The restaurant had actual carts. The food was Cantonese style with many items this Chinese girl had never tried before. Everything was good quality and taste.   The blog suggested ordering an egg yolk steamed bun (I think that might be the correct literal translation?). Sorry I don't know what that is in Chinese. The English translation on the blog translated by me into Mandarin literally did not mean the same thing. Luckily the server knew what I wanted. Anyways, this bun took 15 minutes to steam and it was worth the wait.  Finally the price was low! We ordered 8 dishes and it was under $40 after taxes. This is my type of price range when it comes to dim sum.   I'd usually give a restaurant 4 stars if the food isn't spectacular or can make a name for itself. But considering the service, parking, quick turnaround, price and cleanliness I'm giving it a 5. My parents have said that they will be back and will even take my cousin. It's good to know that there are solid authentic dim sum places available in this corner of Mississauga without having to drive further east."}
{"text":"My family has been going here from the minute it opened, as we were loyal diners of the related location on Burnhamthorpe back 20 years ago. Whether it is a family dinner or dim sum on the weekend, I find myself here fairly often. I will say that the food is nothing special per se. It is neither good nor bad, just food.  It is the service that really lacks. Granted, there are a few servers who are very pleasant and smile consistently. But for the most part, service is curt and borderline rude. Bills are added up incorrectly and change is returned without the receipt. Remember how much change you should get back! Or, if you're paying by machine, they stand over you. Not in a \"I'm here if you need my help\" way, but more like \"I am making sure you tip us\" way.  That being said, it will not prevent me from returning as it is a family favourite. It is just not my favourite service experience."}
{"text":"The good thing about having out of town visitors is I get to over gorge myself on dim sum and dinners.  We decided to try Summit.  It's been on my to-try list for awhile, although we've always been discouraged because of it's west Mississauaga border of Oakville location.  We arrived around 11am on a Saturday and it was relatively quiet.  The restaurant was about half full which is okay by me since I hate waiting in lines.  Dim sum is served via carts.  All the items in the steamers were hot and fresh while most, if not all, the deep fry items were cold.  They have the standard dim sum items, nothing out of the usual.  No stand out items, everything was just as expected.  We ordered 7 small, 9 medium and 2 large items for a group of six and the bill came to $63 before tip.  Not a bad price, average.  Given the location, we probably wouldn't travel out that far West to go for dim sum there again.  There are closer choices that are just as good."}
{"text":"We went here for dim sum on a weekday. This place is huge and packed up within 30 minutes after we were seated. Dim sum was pretty good but the one bugaboo I have about this place was the chopsticks being VERY sticky. Washing it with tea didn't help. So we decided to use our forks. That wasn't sticky. While dim sum was good, I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"I come here for dim sum when in town. I like the fast service and the dim sum is pretty good. I ordered the chinese broccoli when I went last week to go with my dim sum and it was pretty tasty. I have had better dim sum but its not bad here. I enjoy the lotus balls, pork stuffed buns, shrimp dishes and shrimp on green pepper. The only thing I didn't like is that they demand a tip from you outright. That's why i'm giving it 3 stars. Overall, I don't think you'll be dissapointed if you dine here for dim sum."}
{"text":"My family had pretty bad food at Emerald Chinese restaurant and so we had to find a new casual Chinese dining place for our larger family get together.  This was on our second stop of the GTA West tour of Chinese restaurants.    When we arrived for dim sum (and dinner 2 weeks later), the place was not so crowded but filled enough with people to cause us to wait a tiny bit.  The exterior is an old boring looking strip mall with KFC off to one side.  From the outside, it looks like a really small restaurant but the interior is otherwise.  It's not as large as Emerald but it's certainly bigger than My Perfect Kitchen and Golden Fountain.  The room is clean by Chinese restaurant standard and the decor is more updated compared to My Perfect Kitchen.  I wouldn't call it upscale dining but it's upscale for a Chinese neighbourhood restaurant.  As we waited, I perused through the menus and saw a lot of large banquet menus.  The prices were aligned the higher end of GTA West Asian menus but it certainly wasn't nuts.  Our dim sum adventure started with the whizzing wait staff.  Similar to most Chinese restaurants, they do their function at double speed and offer little anything else.  No smiles, no chats.... just 'what do you want' and go go go.  Dim sum here is the old school style on carts.  It's nostalgic for me to see that.  The constant yelling of their food choices over the Chinese banter is normal for this type of restaurant.  Most of the individuals here are speaking Mandarin instead of Cantonese but it's easy to order as you can just gesture towards them and you point away at what you want.  For our table of 10, we got about 20 dim sum dishes, chow mein, and a fried rice.    For the dim sum, I wouldn't say it blew my socks off but I would say it's average.  They came really hot out of the kitchen and cooked nicely.  Nothing was heavy, dry, or ultra oily... it just wasn't flavourful for what it was.  You'd have to add soy or chili oil to get the flavours going.  We had the typical dumplings (ha gao, beef, siu mai, seafood and veg in clear dumpling wrap), rice wrapped in lotus leaf, rice rolls... there's lots of selection so you're not limited.  The sizes of these dim sum was average as well so they're not tiny portions but certainly not the largest we've seen in GTA. We also got a few dessert items off the cart.  Custard tart, sponge steamed cake, and black sesame rolls.  Like the savoury dim sum, they weren't bad ... just not great.  They didn't seem super fresh (then again, does any dessert option at dim sum seem fresh other than at the super high end places?) .  The custard tart dough wasn't crispy or super sweet but the interior was a good soft mildly sweet chew.  Black sesame roll had great flavour but a touch on the oily side. Sponge steamed cake is always bland but it was tall and large.  For the price, I would say it's a touch expensive for GTA West.  As for dinner, the experience was far quieter and there was definitely less people in the restaurant.  We got a set menu and an extra dish to feed our group of 9.  The chicken was well executed.  Crispy salted skin with moist interior and it wasn't ultra oily.  The Chinese green vegetables (gai lan) was on the gigantic side and required some real teeth gnawing to get them into bite sized pieces.  Flank beef wok seared with XO sauce was tasty and tender.  Shrimp and scallops on bok choy was a bit disappointing.  There was a lot of good vegetables but skimpy on the scallop pieces.  I think we only had 3 for the entire dish.  Pork stewed in a clay pot was a touch too salty... they od'd on the soy perhaps?  but the addition of the mushrooms and vegetables in it was great on rice.  Overall, our dinner experience was better than the dim sum.  The ingredients seemed fresher and more flavourful.  The sizes of the dishes were good but value wise, I wouldn't say it is great.  The price tag for our meal was over $160 which is on the expensive side for Chinese dining.  The price point is clearly in the high end but the service and overall food quality wasn't high end.  It's somewhere slightly above average.  It's too bad that Mississauga is lacking in good Chinese restaurants.  This one does fit into the middle nicely but I wish they either upped their quality and service or lowered their pricing.  It's stuck in the bad spot of being over priced GTA West Chinese food."}
{"text":"Food is yummy (dim sum). Lots of variety, such as (please forgive any spelling errors) har gao, sho mai, egg tarts, almond jello, crab claw, etc. On weekends, they also have a really good coconut roll thing. They also have a menu to order from if you're not interested in dim sum.  It gets really busy sometimes (especially weekends), so good to go early, especially if you have a large group. Or they also do reservations.  Service isn't very friendly or attentive. Sometimes takes a long time to get anyone's attention - even just for a simple glass of water. The carts didn't always pass by the table, so would have to draw their attention from a few tables away."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the portions were small.  The service was poor, would it kill you to smile???  For what they charge, they don't give you that much, and therefore I would say this place has poor value for the money (dinner).    Derek"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant online,  and thought to give it a try.  The food was blend and average at best.  And as I bit into a sio mai,  I found this huge rubber label that found its way into the meat stuffing.  I nearly checked on it.   When I told the server,  she gave me this annoyed look,  and when I asked to speak with the manager,  she barked across the room at some guy in the suit.  He walked over and asked what is wrong.  I nicely showed him what was found in the room.  He responded saying...\"so what do you want? \" I was stunned.  And he then said,  do you want me to take it away? I'll cancel the order.    So he grabbed the plate,  scribbled on the order sheet,  and walked away.  No apologies,  no further actions were taken,  no discounts for the meal.    This is by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  Horrible food and service,  and absolutely unapologetic about their mistakes.   Don't go there! There are lots of other restaurants in mississauga that isn't disgusting or rude."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Mississauga.  Innovative and good variety of dim sum selection.  A bit crowded on weekends so get there early.  A little pricey but that's what you get for trying to find good dim sum in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Another standard dim sum place. The skin on the shrimp dumplings was very very sticky, mine was stuck hard to another and then ripped when I tried to take it out of the container. :( Nothing really stood out to me as being particularly good or bad really, although I will say the BBQ pork inside the rice rolls we ordered was quite dry, it had a cardboard-like texture. But this seems to be a common problem in many dim sum restaurants. Prices were reasonable here as each person in my table of 5 chipped in $9. I wish the staff pushing the carts were more enthusiastic - sometimes they didn't even call out the names of the dishes they were carting around. We had to approach them and ask them, which was irritating... like you have one job..."}
{"text":"Summit Garden Chinese Cuisine is an authentic Chinese restaurant on Winston Churchill Blvd and Dundas St in Mississauga. They have been in business for about 18 years, and have a reputation for being consistent with their food and service. I can definitely see the reason why they have been a successful for so long, as many of their diners are returnees with their family members.   Summit Garden Chinese Cuisine's interior was spacious and rather stunning with its ornately decorated Chinese decor. Like several mid-upscale restaurants, Summit Garden has an open dining area that is also available for large parties, weddings, and private parties. The space allows diners to have an enjoyable and comfortable experience without being seated in a cramped space.   Upon entering, we were welcomed by the hostess and seated at our reserved table. Due to the extensiveness of the menu, we decided to get recommendations from the owner, Kenneth Choi, who chose all of the following items for us to try. The extensive menu consisted of several traditional Chinese dishes, but they do have set meals as well. I would say that the set meals offer more of a value, and is highly recommended if you want to try more items.  We started off with the Peking Duck; one of the most popular menu items at Summit Garden Chinese Cuisine. The Peking Duck was sliced table-side, and served with pancakes, sauce, and scallions as toppings. The pancakes came in a steamer basket with several ingredients as garnishes. The pancakes were rather big, and soft, which went well with the crispy and well-seasoned duck skins. Don't forget to pack the pancake with a piece of scallion and cucumber each to enhance the flavor. This was a great first course, and I was looking forward to the next few courses.   As seen above, the Peking Duck was served in a traditional two course meal. First out was the duck skins with pancakes, and the second course was duck meat sautéed with vegetables to be eaten as a salad wrap. The portion was more than enough for two people, and arrived beautifully plated.   One of the highlights of the night was the lobster, which was served Hong Kong style, where the lobster was fried and seasoned. I love seafood, so the Wok-Fried Jumbo Lobster (2 pounds) was quite an impressive feast. The lobsters at Summit Garden Chinese Cuisine was served Hong Kong style, but they modified it slightly. It wasn't the traditional fried lobster from Hong Kong. Rather, I was told that their version was more of a modified version, as they use deep fried fish as well to create a balance in flavor. The lobster here was not super salty, which I enjoyed! Additionally, the lobster meat was tender and succulent.    There are some Japanese-inspired dishes on the menu including this Fried Japanese Style Tofu ($11.95). Japanese tofu is a popular Japanese appetizer that is often found in many restaurants and izakayas. Summit Garden Chinese Cuisine's interpretation of the tofu dish was not the traditional style. Rather, they made it their own with a hint of Chinese flavoring in the sweet and savory sauce. The portion was very generous, and the tofu themselves were nice and plump.   Summit Garden Chinese Cuisine is a lovely Chinese restaurant in Mississauga, and perfect for all occasions. They are open for weekend dim sum, lunch, and dinner 7 days a week."}
{"text":"One of the better/cleaner Chinese banquet-style restaurants in Mississauga.  Depends on what type of meal you are going for - offers dim sum, full lunch and dinner services and even can be rented for weddings/celebrations. Because of the location, there is a good multicultural mix of people (not just Chinese people) and therefore the waitresses/servers can communicate in English.  Pros - average food (dim sum & dinner service) - environment/ambiance: very clean and spacious; comfortable setting - comparable prices to other Chinese banquet-style restaurants in Mississauga, but better environment and food  Cons - average food (is a pro and a con; not the most delicious, but very normal quality) - service is average; normal Chinese restaurant style service (nothing exceptional, nothing supbar; just gives you what you need)  Overall Definitely a good standard choice for dim sum or Chinese meals in Mississauga; borderlines Oakville, so the clientele is definitely more multicultural, which means cleaner and more well-kept restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate Year of the Rabbit with a dozen peeps roughly split between Asian and gwai lo. Our hosts were regulars so the service was pretty solid and attentive. The food on the other hand was a hit and miss. Just for fun, let me enumerate my findings in the style of top yelper WaYnE C:  * 2 Courses of Peking Duck: this was CARVED at the Table and highly Crispy. The \"Torillias\" were really sticky though, not like I'm used to. * Lobster: I didn't bother, because this is a Bitch to eat with Chopsticks. * Deep Fried Tofu: Not very good at all(lame). No Flavour and really oily.(-0.5 Star) * Cantonese Chow Mein: Hard to screw this up, right? * Ying Yang Fried Rice: This looked SCARY, but I actually enjoyed it. A blanket of Gooey Shrimps & Tomato Chicken over Fried Rice.(+1 *Star*) * Beef & vegetable Ho Fun: The Ho Fun was SO FUN. :P(+0.5 Star) * Salt and spice prawns: These were QUITE Awesome. Nicely Spiced.  * Sauteed chicken with mango: Meh. * Hot and sour soup: I've had better. Not really as Sour as it should be. * Lettuce Wraps: These were good, but the Lettuce should have been more FRESH.  Not a bad experience overall. I would say it was A-OK. Prices seemed pretty reasonable as well.  Obligatory Title Pun: Don't let down your GARD.  Menu Readability: Thankfully, I let other people deal with this. It was so long and loaded with incomprehensible options.  Need to mention: Wayne C is pure awesomeness! Read his reviews: http://vvaynec.yelp.ca/  What this place teaches me about myself: I've been spoiled by my proximity to Chinatown."}
{"text":"WHAT TO EAT?  I like the dinner and brunch options at Summit Garden. I've been coming to this restaurant for many years, and I don't have much to complain about the quality of the food I get. Most recently, came here for dim sum after over well past 5 years. If you have trouble visualizing the dim sum and require pictures, this restaurant might be the place to eat when you're craving dim sum. Still utilizes dim sum pushing carts, you can go right up to the cart and ask to see what kind of steamed or fried dim sum the cart has to offer. Some like this personal experience of opening the lid of the steam basket and seeing what kind of scrumptious deliciousness lie underneath. The dim options are really vast and great!  LAST TIPS?  Dim sum? Go on a Saturday or Sunday to see the full extent of dim sum they have to offer. I highly suggest their spring rolls and their roast pork if you liked fried food! Their roasted pork is one of the best in the city! Crisp pork skin with a great crunch and pork looks fresh. You won't regret getting anything from their barbecue menu, I can guarantee that! ;)    Their roasted duck too!! Try the Peking duck dish!"}
{"text":"I'll start off with the good because there is only 1 bad thing about this place so I gave it a 4/5. The food is always fresh and the quality is amazing especially for Mississauga. It's authentic and just delicious. Price is fair and understandable which makes it worth it. Location is convenient and the interior is like any Chinese restaurant.   The bad: we always go during dim sum and the people who push the carts especially the young men that work there are SO nice and patient and always provide really good service. Especially for a Chinese restaurant where service is shotty these young men really were good at costumer service. HOWEVER the women who take the orders for the table like drinks and stuff from the menu are actually terrible. There was this one with red lipstick she had the worst attitude I've ever had and threw around our food on the plates like they weren't even flat on the table because she would throw it and when we asked for water and hot sauce politely she was like can you be patient? She said that word for word. I can't even imagine why she would want to be a server with an attitude like that. We only gave a 7% tip because of this and she complained loudly to the cashier lady in front of us. Honestly disgusting. The boss of this place is always nice and professional but this lady turned us off the whole experience."}
{"text":"Summit Gardens IS THE WORST CHINESE RESTAURANT I HAVE BEEN TO IN 20 YEARS.  DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT.  The staff is atrocious.   The managers are horrible, not customer-centric in the least, and could not care at all about any type of service or the food.  We ordered Cantonese chow mein, chicken with black bean sauce, hot and sour soup, and sweet and sour chicken.  The chow mein was undercooked, there was one shrimp in the dish, and no sauce.  The sweet and sour chicken was over-cooked, and the chicken with black bean sauce tastes like a salt lick.  I had to drink water for three days afterwards.    The sad thing is that the service is worse than the food.  Everyone from the staff to the managers are atrocious.  The minute you walk in to spend your money on overpriced Chinese food, they look at you like you are inconveniencing them.  When you wait in line they actually have let other families to their tables before you, and the manager and a waiter actually and literally stood overtop of our table speaking for 2 minutes about another table!!! I could feel and smell the manager's breath on me.  Talk about uncomfortable!!    This is the FIRST negative review I have ever posted on Yelp as I would always want to post and recognize great service from local businesses and business owners as it is a tough gig.  Unfortunately, Summit Gardens deserves a 1 out of 5 star.  Save your time and money.  I honestly think Panda Express may be better.  What does that tell you?"}
