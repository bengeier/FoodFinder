{"text":"Second time here and it was better than the first time.  The food is the best and the wait staff is every bit as food.  Had the rib eye and it was cooked perfect.     Will make a point of coming back."}
{"text":"I had dinner here over the Valentine's Day long weekend, and I noticed a lot of negative reviews here on actual Valentine's Day due to slow service etc.  We felt the opposite, our service was impeccable and everything came in a timely manner.  We orders the scallops, lobster bisque, USA rib eye 14 oz and Alberta striploin 16oz and a side of mushrooms and asparagus.  We shared this amongst 4 people and we all left very full.  The price is up there with Jacob's which we have been to several times.  I would say the food was comparable if not better, although Jacob does have the best caesar salad in all of GTA.  The rib eye was the favourite of the night, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside with just the right amount of marbling!  I found the scallops to be good but expensive at $24.  Between the 4 of us, our meal was $78 pp which also included a $65 bottle of red, overall not too bad for fine dining.  I'm happy there is now a real steak house in Mississauga and you don't have to worry about parking like in Toronto.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Best Best food in a long time!!!!! Yes it's a little pricey but.......you will never be treated better, you will never taste better food and be in a more beautiful place like this for the little extra money you will gladly dish out. The food blew my mind...enough said."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to celebrate his birthday. The food and service were excellent! The wagyu is delicious. Appreciate their birthday surprise with the desserts and sparkler!"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of going to this steak house twice in the past summer, and both times were excellent. Both times were just after noon and the steakhouse was quite quiet so we had a lot of choices where to sit (we chose by the grand piano). Our server was very professional and very much looked after everyone of our needs and requests. The wine list was very adequate with a number of very good selections to compliment our main courses (steaks, of course!). The selection varied from very high end wines to very nice Vintages (release or essentials) choices. The steaks was excellent: Perfectly grilled and seasoned, and all the sides were very creatively prepared (wild mushrooms, Brussel Sprouts, etc...).  I found out about this establishment by accidents. We were thinking of going to La Castile once again, but, after doing some research I found out that they weren't open so early so I found this place listed and after a quick call I was able to make reservations and ensure we could have a nice steak for lunch (They have a lunch menu, however, we were able to order from the dinner menu with no problem).  The items are priced similarly to other top end steak houses. The nice thing was they had a selection of not only Canadian, but also US beef, and, IIRC, Wagyu beef. Lots of choices for the cow aficionado!!!!  We enjoyed ourselves both times. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow...really enjoyed the atmosphere and most of all the food. Hats off to the chefs! Fish was unreal, still have to try the steaks here."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my husbands birthday on a Monday evening.  It was really quiet with just one other table.  Ordered the Caesar salad, escargot stuffed mushroom caps, ribeye and duck confit.  Everything was delicious except for the duck confit because it was soooo salty.  Couldn't even keep eating after one bite.  Had to tell the kitchen to take it back and they brought us an organic chicken dish instead and also gave us dessert for free to make up for the duck.  Service was great but found the food to be salty and overpriced.  Certain dishes were better than others."}
{"text":"Big surprise! Steak melts in your mouth like butter but Jimmy and the owner Victor are the best, made my wife and I fell right at home if my home was a castle and we were King and Queen great atmosphere and great service must stop by if your looking for a great meal and great servers"}
{"text":"17 steakhouse is Hands down the best steakhouse in Mississauga .  I've eaten at several steakhouses in the GTA such as Jacobs , Harbor 60, Nao and Hys. I would definitely rate 17 steakhouse up there in terms of food, service and atmosphere.  Food : Their servings are very generous and reasonably priced.  For appetizers try the fois gras and steak tartare. Try their USDA bone in rib eye or the porterhouse for steak . Also they are very well known to their lamb chops. Side dishes you must order the maple Brussels sprouts and mushroom risotto !   Service is impeccable , Trevor our server is was very accommodating and knowledgeable ."}
{"text":"The service guy was very confused; But the lady who helping him at the end was excellent. The entertainer was great however He did have a little too much to drink but who doesn't now of these days.  FOOD AMAZING. when It came time to pay the server again has problems with cashing people out. He is so new to the job. His tip would of drop but he already added It to my bill. The manager was great for checking up on us making sure we didn't se roaches like my last review amazing job!!! The bread was great presentation great ."}
{"text":"I felt the need to write this review solely because I really think more people need to know about this hidden gem.  I was with approximately 10 people from work and we were able to get same day reservations.  The steak that I had (I am a huge steak lover) was one of the best I have ever had.  It was a 40 oz (yes that is not a misprint) porterhouse that was charred great on the outside and a perfect medium rare inside.  The spices used were amazing.  Because I had such a slab of meat I only sampled the Mac and cheese side course and it was exceptional.  Yes, I did eat the entire steak and although it was my largest ever, I never regretted the decision!!! I even had creme brûlée for dessert which was heavenly.  Despite the size of our group, they did ALL separate checks and there was no automatic gratuity which I loved.  Service was great - my only concern with this place is that it needs more customers or else it will close - trust me you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was a bad idea to come on valentines but I wouldn't expect to wait 2 hours or more for food anywhere even on a day like today. We made a reservation at 8 and got seated fairly quickly. The place was not packed but it wasn't empty either. We waited 15 minutes to get the menu and another 30 minutes to place our order. We even had to wait another 15 minutes for water...everything was completely disorganized!! It's funny because I've been here since 8 pm and I'm typing this all out as I'm still waiting for my food... It's 10:25pm. We ordered a Caesar salad, lamb rack, Ontario rib eye and the maple bacon Brussels sprouts. Literally still waiting.. We would've walked out already but who I believe to be the manager said he would cover our tab 40 minutes ago. Here we are still waiting what a nice valentine. We asked the server multiple times to check on our food every time he said a couple minutes. This is a review basically on the horrible service because I have yet to receive my food... VERY VERY DISORGANIZED."}
{"text":"Hey guys so unfortunately this is going to be a bit of a negative review. We came here last night as a party of 5. The service was below par and although the server was trying his best, he's just fell short on multiple things. We were also upset about why this upscale restaurant didn't have a drink list on hand. The menu was pretty straight forward for a steakhouse. The venue was decent but still felt empty and not very intimate. Considering the restaurant was fairly empty at 10 pm on a friday night we were 5 people sitting at a 6 person set table and we were pretty squished. Very surprised the waiter didn't move us into a bigger area. The food was really good so I can say that. The final nail in the coffin was when we asked for a final drink for desert we were brought the wrong ones and had to speak to the owner about it which he remedied fast.  Overall food was good, 3/5 of us will not return.  Best of luck to this restaurant hopefully they can work on the weaknesses and improve because the owner seemed like a genuine person !"}
{"text":"Surprisingly a good place for a good steak dinner in a romantic, upscale atmosphere. Didn't even know this place existed in this plaza. While the menu description for their steaks could be improved (the quality of their steaks are top 2% but you don't see this from reading their menu, which gives a very brief and vague description), the food speaks for itself. I was dining with a meat specialist (literally, he buys meat for a living) and he approved of the steak. Fat was trimmed off and steak had been aged.  A colleague had the scallops to start and was very satisfied with it. I was surprised the starter came with 3 large scallops for only $16. I had the lobster bisque and thought it was just right in terms of flavour but wish it had real chunks of lobster.  It's too bad this place doesn't have more business but if you're in the area and want a white linen romantic dinner or have a huge party to host (it's a big restaurant and ideal for corporate functions or large dinner parties of 50+ people), check this place out."}
{"text":"We went here for my sister's birthday and let me say... I think we found our new place for celebrations! Victor (the owner) believes in creating an unforgettable dining experience and it shows. We felt catered to and pampered and the experience itself was unforgettable. Now for the food. Oh the food. The main and the appetizers were phenomenal. The meat had just the perfect level of flavour and it was suggested that I go medium because of the cut. If you get a chance, go here! Take someone with you and they will thank you for it."}
{"text":"Incredible selection of steaks. The waiter was knowledgeable and friendly. I ordered the prime ribeye and it was cooked perfectly and very tender. The sides are also generous so 2 will do for 3 people. One of the top spots in GTA."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend over the weekend and was blown away by the quality of the food and service. Had the Canadian ribeye, mushroom risotto, duck fat potatoes, and field green salad. Steak was perfectly cooked and delicious. Not a risotto person but this was ridiculously good and I ate more than half the portion myself lol. Finished with cheesecake and creme brulee. Better than many of the steakhouses I've been to in the city!"}
{"text":"When we arrive at 545 pm the whole front desk was deserted. The restaurant opens at 5 but we thought maybe it was 6. After standing there awkwardly for a few minutes and seeing a table with guests at it we decided to roam further in. Hello and excuse me called with no response. At this point the guests at the seated table and us looked at each other a bit more than awkwardly. Finally a few minutes later a staff appears and greets us. They don't have high chairs... just booster seats plus no change tables.    So my brother brought me here for a Christmas present he promised 5 months ago but we never had time. So my bf and sister in law with my nephew all came together.  The server was a little TMI with my sister in law maybe to create a connection cause she has a baby. Within the 1.5 hours we were there we found out he was divorced, had 2 daughters who he sends money to, took awhile to settle down and plans to move to NYC... :o   Okay the place is nice when you walk in, the interior was made to impress but the carpet looks old and the empty front hall is just not welcoming.   The food:  Ahi Tuna: Good, I like the wasabi, just wish it wasn't all the way on the bottom of the greens so the portioning can be done through out the dish.  Grilled Calamari (Special): Was done well, it was tender and not chewy. The olives and capers though... way too salty as a topping for the calamari and it was on every piece. The lemon would have been sufficient. (Becomes a theme though)  Mushroom Risotto: Deconstructed risotto if anything, large pieces of rice with a medley of vegetables in a nice cream sauce. Delicious!  Sea Bass: Was not worth the price and the presentation nor freshness was the best. We have fresh bass all the time and the meat here was on a lower level than a tilapia (fresh one)  US Prime Ribeye 14 oz: My brother and I both got this... the meat was good, some really decently cooked fatty parts. My brother's had these beautiful grill marks on top and mine was bare... a bit inconsistent. The only off putting part was honestly the salt... it was way too salty. Part way through my brother had to ask for HP sauce :s to add a different dimension. We were all pretty parched after the meal.  Sides: Asparagus (Amazing...lots of butter and fat from the pancetta that hardens on the plate as it gets cold lol) Roasted Roma Tomatoes: Pretty okay...brother's choice  Tiramisu: My brother and his wife didn't' like this made in house tiramisu... it's not authentic at all. White on top and not coffee grind. Too much cream or mascarpone as 1 single layer.   The manager did come over and ask how the meal was which was nice but it didn't feel like we could actually say something to him... didn't even get his name.  Overall probably wouldn't go to the Keg over this for steak meat but wouldn't come back here either. At least 2 other good places out there in this price range in Mississauga alone."}
{"text":"Finally made an account so I could leave a review for 17. My friends and I came for dinner and started with the tartare and scallops. Scallops were cooked perfectly, and my friends (who don't like tartare) really enjoyed that too. We each ordered a different wagyu cut. (Japanese striploin, snake river strip, and flat iron) we requested to see the Japanese cut and the waiter actually brought it out and it looked gorgeous. If you're worried that you're cheaping out by getting the flat iron--You're not. As one of the only restaurants around licensed to serve wagyu, this is an experience everyone must try."}
{"text":"Whew, I'm totally backed up on reviews but this place just became first on my list!   Whoever reviewed this place and gave 5 stars obviously is friends with the owner or worker because this place is a straight up SHAM!   - Valentine's reservation for 9pm (I know my man planned a late dinner lol)  - we arrived at 8:55pm and the maitre de said it would be a 5 minute wait (although there was 4 couples ahead?)  - decided to sit at the bar and grab drinks before would be seated... One drink became 3 drinks... 5 minutes became 15 more minutes and tables are empty yet we're still sitting at the bar? - as soon as we noticed it was 10:30pm (still seated at the bar); we were like \"whaaaatttt the hell\" so we ask to speak to the manager- the bartender points at this man and says \"you see that man that's leaving? He's the manager\" WOW  - so we ordered our food; received the appetizers at a reasonable amount of time but the entrees; 1 hour tops.  - it's hitting 11:51pm and the manager comes to our table and makes a complete joke of himself and the situation and says \"how are you enjoying the food now that it has finally arrived?\" Seriously dude?  - he offered us a free drink and dessert... At that point I just wanted to shank myself with a butter knife than to be there for another minute.   Food: lobster bisque and field greens salad  US striploin and Bison--- for what we ordered it was not worth what we paid   Total bill: $200. Comped nothing. If you go; bless your heart because you will have a tragic time."}
{"text":"This place is the full package.  Great ambiance, attentive service and delicious high-quality food.  I had the lamb on a previous visit and enjoyed it. Tonight I had the Canadian ribeye with mushroom risotto and it was one of the most flavorful pieces of beef I have had at a restaurant.  This is a must stop on every trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Cannot stop raving about the food and experience at this place!   I've been to many steakhouses in the GTA and I can say 17 Steakhouse is way better than Jacobs downtown!  Came for dinner and ordered the US Prime Striploin and my partner ordered the Canadian Prime Ribeye. Both were cooked to perfection. For sides we ordered the mash potatoes and ripini and also had a Caesar salad to start. Warning: the portions are HUGE. The mash potatoes could probably feed 4 girls. My partner and I definitely could not finish the sides.  The owner Victor offered us complimentary desserts and even gave us a tour of the banquet hall upstairs. Our server Trevor was also fantastic! Overall, a BEAUTIFUL venue and excellent service and food!"}
{"text":"It had been an awesome and a really special experience at 17 for us. From the hot puffy breads, to the amazingly prepared appetizers, and to the main event of the night..everything went perfectly. The service, food, ambiance and location deserve my 5-star rating. My husband ( the expert when it comes to making steak) is willing to step aside, with hands down  and give his praise to 17 for the STEAK. We got INTOXICATED by the exquisite taste of our meal.  Now we know where to celebrate special occasions"}
{"text":"15 minutes and we are sitting on Valentine dinner and no one notice or presence, no water no menus and 5 waitress are roaming around us and no manager, we are still invisible. I had to speak up and ask for service and finally we got TWO menues, when we ask for a third one they said we are working on it! !!!  Anyway, Risotto was undercooked, duck confee was under seasoned, sticky pudding was not sweet enough. The beef tartar was very good though. Don't think I would go again. The restaurant is very impressive from inside."}
{"text":"17 Steakhouse   Went to this place for a friends birthday. We were a group of 12 hungry adults. After reading all the reviews here, I had very high expectations, but left extremely disappointed. I don't know how this place got such a high review, but this isn't the best steak in the GTA   Location: On Dixie, south of the 401. Kinda awkward location for a steak place. This used to be a banquet hall. Large parking lot with loads of room. 3/5 stars   Atmosphere: It's steak house/bar. Large dining room area with plenty of tables. Bar with TV so you'll not miss the game. They have a baby grand piano in the main dining area. I believe they also have private rooms, but I don't know if they charge extra. When you go inside, it's decorated like a 40's, high class bar. Which includes fancy chandeliers. 3/5 stars   Service: For our group, there is one person serving us. But I have to say, she was amazing! Very prompt with our orders and was helpful with the menu. But I wonder, if it's the same when they are busy. We did go there on a Friday night, and the place was empty. Only 3 or 4 tables were books that night. I would want to see how service is like on a busy night. But the good thing is they didn't automatically add tip to your bill for large groups, they make your server earn the tip. 4/5 stars   Food: Well the food was surprisingly mediocre. Let's start with the steak, since this is a steak place. Order a ribeye steak medium, but it came out border line well done. I feel like it was sitting under a heat lamp a little too long. It wasn't juicy, so to compensate, they put this gravy looking sauce underneath. Not worth the $50 price tag. Nothing specific the flavours, and the way the cook the meat was standard. The quality of was great. What I did enjoy was the seared ahi tuna with a avocado mousse and mango salsa. And my wife had seared foie gras with a peach & cherry gastrique for appetizer. This were great and would order it again. 3/5 stars   Price: Overpriced! The food did not match the prices. You would think that your food was being prepared by Gordon Ramsay. Check out their prices on http://www.17steakhouse.com/m/menus/dinner-menu/ 2/5 stars   Overall: I don't think this place will be there for long. With a large dining room, which looks never busy, the over head cost will catch up to them. I can almost guarantee the quality of their meat will go down. I would not go back if the prices stay the way they are. 3/5 stars  Follow me for more pictures on:  Instagram: 905japes Twitter: 905Japes"}
{"text":"My first visit to this new Steakhouse.  It was an interesting experience. Our food was very good & it was all served a-la-carte. The reason I gave it a 4-Star versus a 5-Star is our server was only good & not great. He should have been great.   For the cost of a $120.00 steak, $18.00 order of mushrooms & a $150.00 bottle of wine the service should have been superb. He was slow & clumsy & missed several service steps (full water glass, clearing table service,) that should have been second nature. This is a great location if you'd like to impress a client but for me...not a do-over."}
{"text":"This is probably my fav  steak house...the ambience and service is impeccable. I wud recommend you try the Japanese steak if you cud afford it... the waiter talked us into it and it was scrumptious. Overall the the meals I had here was satisfying... yo guys go easy on the mashed potatoes...it too big of a portion and I always feel sad leaving it..."}
{"text":"One of the best lamb shanks, and Ribeye steaks I've ever had. The atmosphere is gorgeous and the service is pretty great too. Owner even comes out to make sure everything is okay and you are enjoying your meal. When you want a high-end experience, this is exactly what you should get."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party.  The place was pretty empty on a Saturday. There was only a few table occupied. Surprised by the overall interior of the place. The decor was beautiful it felt more like a place for wedding ceremonies. The lighting of the place was pretty dim. They had really unique menus. When you open their menu it would light up. This made it easier to read.   I ordered the chicken with bacon Brussels sprouts and a Cesar salad.  Let me tell you.  Never order chicken at restaurants. They chicken was dry and totally not worth the price. I was also not a big fan of the Brussels sprouts they were blah.   Also tired their beef tartare probably one of my favourite dishes that night. The grilled scallops are pretty good too.   My friends order the steaks and they found it perfectly cooked and delicious. Another friend of mine ordered the lamb rack. She loved it. Said it was really juicy and delicious.    For dessert I ordered the cheesecake. Didn't really like it, was really sour and soft. Was not expecting it to be like that.   Food presentation is pretty nice except for the chicken...    At the end of the meal, they give you chocolate truffles.   The service was great, the waiter was attentive though they did not give my friend anything special for his birthday. Pretty disappointing when you pay so much for a meal and they don't give you anything for your birthday...   Overall, decent place, nice decor, great service.  Avoid ordering chicken. Their steaks are better."}
{"text":"I have read all the great reviews so I was anticipating taking some colleagues to dinner, especially since it is close to the office and I was thinking this could be the perfect place to entertain clients and hold events.   The restaurant looks great, nice decor and very comfortable booths. We ordered a few glasses of wine and right away without tasting, it was obvious the wine was corked. We made the server aware and without hesitation he agreed to replace it. New wine arrives and given that I often order this particular wine, it's obvious that this is not the wine I ordered. I didn't bother to send it back a second time. I guess they assume most people don't know the difference. It was a nice wine - but not what I ordered.   The service was good and attentive without being overdone. Despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy, our food arrived in stages so we were waiting for each dish to arrive separately which meant that some of it was cold before everyone was served. I observed the same thing happening at the table behind us. Having everyone's meal served together would seem to be \"table steaks\" in a fine dining restaurant.   My colleague said that his rib eye was okay but he'd had better. It was a thin steak despite the price tag. I had the American Wagyu flat iron and it was very good and flavourful. My other colleague had the arctic char and it was good and very nicely garnished but unfortunately over-done. The massive side dish of mashed potatoes was really good as were the wilted greens side dish.   Overall it was disappointing and it's difficult to believe that all the glowing reviews are legitimate. Sadly, I wouldn't bring important clients :-("}
{"text":"We went back to give them another try and very glad we did. We were super excited to see Trevor would be our server again. He did a fabulous job. As for the food, it was all excellent. We enjoyed all aspects of our meal and the manager Jimmy came to see if we had a better experience this time. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through a friend and decided to come for Valentine's Day because Ruth's Chris only offered the prix fixe menu. I'm so glad I did! The appetizer platter was to die for. The scallops were cooked perfectly. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and very friendly. There was a man who came by our table two-three times (I think he's the owner) to check up on us which was nice. Our reservation was for 5pm and the restaurant was just beginning to fill up so our food and everything came out fast. Id definitely recommend this place, comparable to Jacobs and harbour 60 imo"}
{"text":"This steakhouse is amazing the decor and service is great but the food is the best part I've Been 3 times now and all 3 were spectacular. The last time being the best I was told to try the burger and I am glad I did. I know a good burger and this one is bomb they use fresh grind high quality steak to make it and it's on my favs list with burger priest. They usually only serve it for lunch but if you ask I'm sure they will make it for you. Either way all the food is amazing and they have a good selection for everyone on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience. I ordered the US ribeye (medium rare) with grilled mushrooms and potato fingerlings with a glass of red wine.   The food was AMAZING. The steak was grilled to perfect. Not only was the meal amazing but the service was PHENOMENAL.   Not too obtrusive and not too pushy.   What I liked about my dining experience were all the small things that made it great.   When my bill arrived, it came with a truffle and I usually do not like truffles. Oh my goodness! This was literally the best truffle I have ever had in my life.  This was a great dining experience from beginning to end and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Their steaks!! I would recommend the bison tenderloin if you want a steak which is tender and juicy.   We ordered apps, sides and dessert on top of the steak. I thought what stood out the most were the steaks. Of the steaks we also ordered US prime rib, Canadian prime rib and steak tenderloin.  The steaks were done to everyone's liking and we also liked the baked garlic on the side as a nice touch. Very tasty.   We ordered a calamari appetizer as it was a special for the night. I thought the calamari was fresh and cooked well however the garnish they put it with - both black olives and green capers - was a bit too much. Either one or the other would have made the dish tasty and bring out flavors already.   In terms of the sides, I recommend the maple bacon and Brussel sprouts dish. The flavors of the bacon really makes the brussel sprouts stand out in flavor too. What a great combination.   The desserts were okay. I didn't think it was that good. I ordered the flourless chocolate cake with ice cream. I thought the cake was not made fresh to order but rather felt like it was made before hand and heated up.   LAST TIP?  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the steak we got for dinner. This restaurant can be on the expensive end based on the price you pay for the steak only without any sides, so I would come here to get the steak and maybe a side or two. The focus wouldn't be on the appetizers or the desserts though. Just my two cents."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a colleague after seeing a sign they were open for lunches. We had been on our way to the Belfast but wanted to check this place out. Turns out this is their first week open for lunch, though they opened the restaurant in September.   The lunch menu was quite varied and I chose the lobster bisque and the salad Niçoise. The seared tuna on the salad was a bit salty but otherwise very good, the salad was not overdressed and the ingredients fresh and crisp as they should be.  The egg was pergectly poached.  The bisque was also hearty and at the same time light, though I didn't personally care for the terragon foam.  Overall a very enjoyable lunch, which would have been more so had I not had to go back to work, then I could have indulged in the wine offerings.   As it's a steak house I'm feeling remiss for not having one this time, but that just means I'll have to come back again for one later!"}
