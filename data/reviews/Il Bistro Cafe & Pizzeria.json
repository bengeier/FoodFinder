{"text":"We have finally found our hot spot! We ordered a pizza and couldn't believe how amazing it was.  Finally we have real authentic Italian pizza in Newmarket/Aurora. Best in town. Not to mention the price was a deal and a half."}
{"text":"This place is the best. If you are looking for a real veal sandwhich look no further. Eugine will take care of you. Its a family place and they remember most of their customers. Plus the pizza is authentic."}
{"text":"Anyone who comes up to the northern burbs of Toronto should try IL BISTRO.  If you're in Aurora or Nwmarket it's pretty easy to find since it's on a main street - Bayview Ave.  It's a small Italian family run pizzarea perfect for pickup, not for sitting in.  The family is very friendly and easy to start a convo with.  I have noticed alot of regulars while i'm sitting and waiting, and that's a good sign.  Now for the Pizza - just plain excellent.  For me i have to love the sauce on a pizza and i love theirs.  If you wanna support family run businesses or you just want a really pizza, pop into il bistro, you'll be happy with your order."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but I was honestly hoping for better. Chicken on a bun was huge and tasted very good. I would go back for the sandwich and maybe try a different type of pizza so that I could give this place a fair review. Owners are super nice."}
{"text":"Always great food and service. I've had the pizza, panz, pasta, veal, chicken parm, and the real treat is the eggplant parm. Wow!   Il bistro has catered a few of our parties. Our guests are always happy with the food.   A real hidden gem in Newmarket. It's not fancy, don't expect ambiance. But you will get great quality Italian food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Veal sandwiches so good it'll make ur head spin... great people runnin the joint! You can taste the love in these sandwiches...A+++"}
{"text":"This is a little gem in the town of Newmarket. I had their veal sandwich and it is to die for! In the past, I haven't had many great veal sandwiches and so I was never a fan of them but this one blew me away. I absolutely love the peppers in them and the portion was huge! I was satisfied with just half. Also the service was awesome! Definitely recommend. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery and got one of the best pizza's I've had in some time. Everything was perfect, a nice sauce and as soon as I smelled it my mouth started watering. There was nothing left to put in the fridge. We almost alway have left overs. And the price knocked my socks off!   Definitely worth a try, I'd strongly recommend this place.  By the way for delivery they only take cash."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pizza! This is the spot I've been looking for in Newmarket. Very excited to have found it. 10/10 for the pizza. Very friendly staff too."}
