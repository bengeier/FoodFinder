{"text":"Very good neighborhood sushi restaurant. I was presently surprised. The Snapper was fresh and cooked perfectly. I have a new spot."}
{"text":"It was awesome! We got there right before closing and they still served us. The sushi is Killer. If your in North Charlotte, this is the closest you can get to New Zealand Cafe without actually driving to New Zealand Cafe"}
{"text":"Service was slow but sushi and fried rice made up for it. The wild thing roll $9 was amazing (one of the best I've ever had) but the Alaskan roll was sub par only because the fried salmon skin took away from the taste  Good sushi place tho!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Have wonderful lunch specials. I eat there frequently. 3 sushi rolls for $10 at lunch is great. Plus they have a great selection of unique rolls. Have wifi as well. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  There are quite a few choices and the ingredients were fresh.  Plus the service is very good."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this local joint shortly after moving into the area. They have the most amazing stir fry around! Their hibachi bowl is a craving we both get often. The rice is so perfectly sticky with chicken, beef, and shrimp. If you want some good sushi too, this is your place. 6 piece of Cali roll for only 4 dollars? YES, PLEASE.   There are some booths and we choose to eat their often because we love getting the giant silver bowl and spoon that the hibachi bowl comes in. Go check this place out!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here last night for some sushi. We ordered the Tokyo, Red Rose and Sommer rolls. The rolls were fresh and yummy. The only thing we werent fond of was, when we arrived we went and sat at the sushi bar. We were told that we had to go back and order at the register. It would have been nice to sit and study the menu over a sip of tea, but i guess thats how they do things here. Overall it was a nice experiance and everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"I don't usually do reviews. I'm more of a lurker. But this place deserves feedback! If we could go 6 stars here we would. The food is great but more importantly the staff is awesome!! Very friendly and willing to cater to your tastes. Hibachi is some of the best I have had and the sushi is perfect! Try the Botz roll!! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have become obsessed with Tanaka's Heather roll its everything I love about sushi rolled into one scrumptious bite! I have to get it at least once a week, and if I don't all is not right in the world... well my life anyway. Definitely give them a shot!"}
{"text":"This review is based on takeout.   The website you order from seems like the restaurant but the order is actually placed by foodie. Kinda weird and screws up the delivery. 30 minutes shown on website; food was delivered over an hour later.  I got the hibachi chicken with noodles and carrots. Carrots were good but huge like someone sliced a giant carrot into thirds. Chicken was okay but only a few pieces. Noodles were fine.  Miso soup was loaded with enough salt to kill a horse.  Edamame was the best part of the dish. No complaints.  3 Kings Bowl was disgusting. 3 pieces of fish were included; one of which was edible. One was so fishy it had to be split out. Another one tasted metallic.  Avoid takeout at all costs. Seriously worried about food poisoning."}
{"text":"I'm almost a regular. I'm making my way thru the menu with no disappointment. Scallops and mixed vegetables I will say has been my favorite so far. The wings are a nice size and burst with flavor. The friendly staff is a plus. I'm all in..."}
{"text":"I expected to go to Tanaka's with my friend to have some sushi and a nice night. What I ended up with was a piece of shaved metal in my mouth, buried away in my rice. When I talked to the sushi chef about it, he offered to compensate my meal. I pressed further and asked about the cooks in the back and he simply told me they had no idea what it was. That's not good enough. On top of that, my friend who abandoned a whole meal after seeing me pull a piece of metal out of my  mouth was yelled at as he tried to leave. They should be glad I didn't confront them in front of their other customers. That's the high road, Tanaka's. Maybe you can learn something."}
{"text":"Very delicious. The fried calamari was really good and flavorful. The hibachi menus come with a variety of options and allow for a customized meal. I had the vegetarian hibachi with tofu, fried rice and carrots. It was one of the best vegetarian hibachis I've eaten."}
{"text":"Great sushi and hibachi - We usually get two sushi rolls and the hibachi bowl (for two people - chicken/steak/sushi).  Although it's pricey, we always have leftovers of the hibachi and can make another meal or two out of it.  Highly recommend the spicy tina roll."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quality sushi on a budget, this is it. Tanaka's has free wifi and great daily deals. I think their spicy tuna maki rolls compare to the same rolls 3x as expensive elsewhere. You usually do wait a little longer because of the small staff, but I value supporting the local small business."}
{"text":"Not quite sure how the sushi is but the place smells funky and we are still waiting on our sushi after 20min. The two guys behind the bar preparing it is steadily chatting with the 4 females sitting in front of them. It's very frustrating when your watching them take there time while your starving.  Also not really a fan of how you have to order"}
{"text":"Great sushi and hibachi for really good prices.  Staff is helpful and friendly and have a great sense of humor.  Highly recommended,"}
{"text":"The food tasted like it was cooked with burnt oil. The service was fair, but I would not go back to this place."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good prices. Love the sushi! Have been looking for a good place since moving from CA."}
{"text":"Great Wednesday Sushi. Their buy 1 get. 1 1/2 off is a real deal. Wait staff is consistent and always remembers what rolls I like."}
{"text":"Had today eel bowl, miso soup and two pieces of nigiri sushi (tuna and mackerel).   Miso soup looked all right, size was a little on the larger side considering it came with the eel bowl. Was to my taste too salty and the wakame weed was gummy - not soaked correctly. Had much better instant miso soups than this specific one.   Eel bowl had an unusual presentation, the eel was not tender and they did not use the right sauce to baste it. Was not at all as expected and had chunks of unpalatable fat near the skin, which wasn't coming off. Rice was slightly undercooked which meant it was difficult to eat the whole thing. But don't worry, I didn't.   Sushi wasn't good either, seasoning in the rice was inexistent, fish was not very tender but looked reasonably fresh, rice was not molded by hand but using boring moulds. The sushi master thought we wouldn't be able to tell the difference perhaps.   All in all the price paid would not justify anything much better than what I got. I don't think I will bother giving a second chance."}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is amazing! Sushi is great, I love their rice, and sweet carrots! Friendly staff, must try"}
{"text":"Great service and excellent sushi.  I had the spicy tuna and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I'd feel confident in referring this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had. I try to visit at least once a week. Everything on menu is freshly prepared. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about a little place called Tanaka's. This is my number one sushi recommendation in the Charlotte area--always of the highest quality, but never breaking the bank. The service is friendly and consistent, and the miso soup is some of the best in the area. We've been coming here for six years and plan to for many years to come! Menu favorites are the Spicy Red Bowl and T-Rex Roll. There's a wide variety of rolls and specials available, and the staff is personable and personal, remembering our orders. The atmosphere is casual, Asian elements but rockin' tunes. If you need a new regular sushi spot in the Charlotte area, it should be Tanaka's."}
{"text":"If you love sushi DO NOT GO HERE! This was by far the worst sushi I have ever had. I just moved to the area and was looking for a good sushi place so I thought I would try tanaka's, which was a huge mistake. I ordered two rolls both $10.00 and I would rather have eaten sushi from a grocery store. I am a sushi lover and am an expert when it comes to sushi especially when it has raw fish in it. Both rolls that I ordered \"said\" they contained raw tuna, however, when they arrived they had barely any at all, I had to dig around the roll to even find a piece of tuna which turned out to be the size of a pea. Needless to say this place was horrible and I will definitely not be returning. Also, the service was HORRIBLE! It took so long to get 2 rolls and then once they arrived they were the worst thing I have ever eaten. I don't know how other people are giving this place any good reviews, they obviously don't know what real sushi tastes like. Once again, if your looking for good sushi stay away from tanaka's!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  It's been a mile from my house for the last 3 years, and I always drove past, writing it off as one of those cheap, strip-mall hibachis that have big portions and not much else.  I was totally off base!  I had the heather roll and the knock-off roll, based on photos other yelpers took.  Both were delicious, and the knock-off roll was really something special.  It was spicy, crunchy, sweet, and fresh.  My wife had hibachi chicken, which was good (and a generous portion, so I was right about one of my earlier assumptions, at least!).  We had the tempura calamari; the portion size was right for an appetizer, it came with vegetables, and the calamari wasn't cut into rings.  I thought it would be chewy, but it was perfectly tender.  The tempura batter was great.    I also thought that it would be a sit down, table service restaurant, but you order from the counter and there aren't any waiters, fyi.  There are good specials (check their website) as well.  Really pleased that I went, and will be back soon."}
{"text":"The manager here is one of the rudest men I have ever encountered. NEVER order from this restaurant online. There are problems with this constantly (as he stated) and they flat out blame the delivery company. What kind of restaurant doesn't value their customers or back their quality of service?!? One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Tanaka's a few months ago.  The food is simply amazing.  I used to just get the take-out and go home but have made it a weekly dinner spot for me and family.  And everyone loves it.  We like to start our meal with edamame...with spring and/or egg rolls ans some SUSHI.   OK...edamame is simple...but when you have a piping hot spring roll....and that great ponzu-like dipping sauce...mmmmmm it makes you forget you order anything else!  And I had to put CAPS on the SUSHI.  I used to love a local sushi place near home...but now...I drive nearly 10 miles past it ....just to get to Tanakas.  After appetizers...out comes the gigantic hibachi bowl...loaded with the best fried rice and chicken, shrimp, steak combo.  Or....a combo plate of fried rice, chicken and veggies!!  Great great stuff.  And where do you go and get a whole bottle of shrimp sauce for the table??  Great service, great food!  \"Tanaka's tanight?\"  Tanaka's any night...except Sunday.  Ohhh what a shame...but the great chef's there...deserve a break too!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled teriyaki chicken rice bowl.They don't allow substitutions so I was stuck with the miso soup that comes with it. I didn't like it and won't try it again. The chicken was ok, but would have been better with some veggies."}
{"text":"First time eating sushi in Charlotte since we moved here in June and this place hit the spot! The sushi chefs chatted with us like we were regulars and didn't mind answering our questions and making sure our sushi was made just how we wanted it! Such friendly staff, all-around!! The S&S roll was AMAZING!! I definitely recommend it and the Wild Thing roll, which is what my husband loved!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Tanaka several times over the past few years.  The food is always great.  I have never ordered take-out, so I have never had a problem with my food being correct, although several other yelpers are correct, it is overpriced.  My problem is with the service.  My husband and I met here for lunch yesterday.  There were two tables of people ahead of us, both of whom seemed to have all ordered hibachi entrees (so did we), and it took well over 30 min to get our food.  It always takes a long time to get food here, but this was something else.  Who has time for food to take that long on a lunch break?!?   We eventually asked why it was taking so long, and miraculously, our food came out relatively quickly after that."}
{"text":"do not i say  again do not go here service was extremely horrid called police on me because i sent a sushi roll which wasn't actually a roll back told to  pay for whole dish cause i ate a piece and a half when waiting for cop to arrive made me sit outside didn't allow me back in wont ever go back in     Update cop also agreed with me and told the owner to learn good customer service"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte?? Not hardly!  I had a mean craving for some sushi and jumped on Yelp to find a sushi restaurant close to my house. After reading the reviews I though I found a winner but the search continues.  I ordered a spicy tuna roll along with a specialty roll called  the Thump roll. Both rolls were way below average and left a lot to be desired. I didn't even eat all of either roll. I've had way better sushi at several different places in and around Charlotte.  Tanaka left me unsatisfied still craving good sushi and almost wanting my money back. If you're a true sushi eater you'll be extremely disappointed with Tanaka."}
{"text":"Tanaka's is one of the best sushi spots in Charlotte (and I'm somewhat of a connoisseur)! All of the rolls that I've tried have been amazing, not to mention the fantastic sushi chefs that will make any roll of your choosing modified to your unique specifications.   The freshness and originality of the rolls is superbly matched by the personality and friendliness of the \"sumo chefs\". I used to live very close and would frequent often to take advantage of both its friendly staff & its many specials. Give this place a try, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Staff is so friendly and hilarious! Great value for the price!  Personal favorite: garlic noodles  Can't speak to the sushi (don't really like fish) but the hibachi is delicious."}
{"text":"So I had heard that this restaurant opened but didn't rush to go there. My husband and I happened to be in the area so we thought we would stop by, and we were pleasantly surprised by what we had experienced.  I really liked the feel of the restaurant but we weren't sure about the concept.  After talking to the hostess we decided to stay and learn more. We decided to go with the all you can eat, but its definitely not like your typical all you can eat, it's not a buffet!! From the beginning we loved our server Maggie, she really helped us understand the menu and how things worked. We tried many items that we maybe would not have tried before but because of the style of dinner we ordered we able to explore our palettes. All was so good, fresh, and tasty!! Service was great and we really cant wait to go back again and try more."}
{"text":"I first found Tanaka's through Foodie Call's order and delivery service and while I have not been to their physical location, I can say that most of the food I've had there is pretty good! It was definitely a pleasant surprise to have stumbled across them, especially considering how difficult it's been to find a decent spot within the University area that knows how to properly prepare sushi and takes pride in the presentation of their rolls.  To name a new favorites though, their steamed Gyoza are very tasty (you can also have them fried); The Wakame (seaweed salad) has a nice flavor to it; All of their sushi (sans anything with octopus or eel that I have yet to try) has been outstanding in flavor, coloring, freshness and spice. I think my favorite is probably their special \"Knock Off Roll\" which has tuna, crab, jalapenos, scallions and cream cheese rolled which is then panko fried and topped with mayo and sriracha sauce. It's a nice change of pace if you're looking for something a little different with some bite to it. All of their Nigiri/Sashimi and Maki rolls are good.  Their prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get for most of their sushi and appetizers, but I'll have to say I've been rather disappointed by the amount of food served under their \"sides\" for the price; An example would be paying $6 for a side of scallops, only to receive 4 scallops total with an inch diameter, with a few pieces of broccoli mixed in. I realize this may cater to the market pricing, but  you're almost better off ordering an additional order of whatever it is you're interested in, than paying for the side items.  That said, the only other complaint I really have about this place, is the quality of their teriyaki chicken, and chicken in general. I've ordered both the kids size and the main dish and found that they barely coated what little chicken I did get with teriyaki sauce. You can order a side of the sauce for a fee, but even still, the flavor was a bit of a let down, which of course brings me to their chicken itself. I have been ordering from here for well over a year, and the quality of their chicken within the last 6 months has changed drastically; I find that it has consistently tasted considerably less fresh, almost borderline bad, and I have been unable to serve any of it to my family for months. I've stopped ordering anything with chicken, simply because it doesn't taste/smell as fresh chicken/poultry should.  So bottom line, if you're looking for some really good sushi at a reasonable price in the University area, stop in and grab you something to eat! I don't think you'll regret it! I would however, based on personal experience, recommend steering clear of anything chicken, just in case."}
{"text":"This is a hidden spot with great sushi. Kind of small and a few seats outside, but very friendly staff.  Don't go if you're in a hurry as they have a small staff and it can take a few minutes to get your food.  however, it is worth the time."}
{"text":"They have good deals every day of the week. I am especially impressed that they have half off wine bottles on Friday and Sat. No one does that I know of.  It gets busy on Wed, half off specialty sushi roll night which I heard might be going away next year :(. I hope not.  They need more tables in here!! It was so cold when we got there but they turned up the heat when requested. I did notice that they upgraded the decor since the last time I was there.  I like this place, I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Great lunch - hibachi shrimp and veg with hot sauce!  Excellent portion for the price.  can't wait to try the sushi."}
{"text":"Good sushi and very quick with take out orders.  Have tried Tanaka around 10 separate time over the last three months and they are very consistent with food quality and taste."}
{"text":"To start off...it seems like you are going to be eating in a restaurant but in fact its more of a you dine in, you get your own silverware, and you also pay before receiving your food, and of course the tip is expected even though you aren't receiving much of the service that should go in hand with it. The food is soooooooo beyond overpriced for what you get it is mind-boggling. The quality of food is just abysmal, I ordered a sushi specialty roll called the X-roll, which on paper sounded good but in reality was just hot mush with extra tuna flavor thrown in. It was without a doubt one of the worst sushi experiences I have ever had. I have no intention of ever repeating it and would advise you to just skip the overpriced stomach ache and eat at MacDonald's."}
{"text":"Drove quite a distance to get here because of the good reviews. By no means was the food bad, it just wasn't amazing either. If I were in the area and needed lunch, I would stop there. But I won't be going out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is near and dear to my heart.....I mean they have the BEST sushi in Charlotte....hands down...the best!  The sushi chef is a master at his craft and a very nice guy(especially to put up with me altering rolls to my liking:-). I haven't tried all the sushi spots in Charlotte, but those I have tried does not even come close to Tanaka's.  My favorites are the Botz roll(spicy crab, shrimp,cukes,scallions topped with sweet chili sauce), the hibachi bowl(shrimp, chicken,steak), and the hibachi salmon....have mercy!  If you haven't tried Tanaka's, you're missing out on  one of the best Charlotte has to offer."}
{"text":"There's a serious void of decent cheap sushi places in Charlotte, at least near the university area. This place fills that void. The staff are great and the food is just as good. Every time I go there the food is consistently awesome. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"My family loves Tanaka. I love their chicken and steak hibachi meals, my hubby swears by their sushi and my kids will eat their chicken every day if we bought it. Every once in a while we eat in, but usually we call in our order and pick it up on the way home.  I like having a reasonably-priced place where we can pick up a dinner that is not fast food. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Ill start off by saying the food is yummy. Fresh made to order. Can't go wrong on tat front.   The service is a bit weird though. You order at the counter then sit down...but you are supposed to be wait on for drink refills etc. But this means that the staff is busy at the counter and not able to make sure you have what you need at the tables.  And the way that it works is that you pay at the counter and then wait on your food. But you're required to out your rip on before receiving service. In our case I tipped well and received no service once we sat down. That annoys me a bit. My tip reflects the service I receive and here you either have to be a prick and not tip or tip regardless of your service."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute dive and I cannot recommend it in any way shape or form.   I walked in and there were towels and rags on the floor under the refrigerated counter areas that you place your order from that included that strange smell of a malfunctioning fridge.  Food-wise, I highly suspect this place simply raids the adjacent low-grade grocery store to resupply itself when running low on items because you couldn't tell me that my order (potstickers) weren't plucked from the frozen food section. Never Again."}
{"text":"Found Tanakas on Yelp. Read the reviews and decided to try it. Far exceeded expectations. The sushi chef was real cool too. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Food was great service was good. I ordered a seaweed salad and was a very very small portion. It's good but definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Staff was cool but not impressed with sushi, at all  I mean people you must not really know what great sushi looks and taste like because this place is mediocre sushi at its best! Over priced tiny peices of sushi that did not leave me wowed like everyone else says.  Staff was friendly tho, but wont go back there again really you call the cops on someone because u cant send a plate back if it was wrong thats just ridiculous. Wont be back there again."}
{"text":"This was the crappiest sushi I've ever had; even worse than at the grocery store. There was imitation crab meat in every roll, and the \"fried\" roll was just rolled in breadcrumbs. After looking forward to it all day, I can honestly say I am shocked by these glowing reviews. Do NOT waste your time and money."}
{"text":"We have been going her for years and this is the best, low cost, Sushi in Charlotte.  Skip the cheap roles and get the Chef specials on Wednesday night for Buy 1 get one 1/2 off.  Either sit at the bar and talk to the man making the Sushi or have a seat.  I just love this place."}
{"text":"Been here over 5 times. Each time is different.  Place has good food and wine. Just think u should do a call in order. They have never gotten my order correct over the phone . Suggeste that u order in person or dine in. But if u order is right u will enjoy your meal"}
{"text":"We are pure sushi fiends! We have this obsessive compulsion to try it whenever we find a new place. Let me tell you straight up, we have ZERO regrets about giving this place a shot. It was AWESOME!! We met my wifes Mother here for lunch and she doesn't really eat sushi, but we talked her into giving it a shot. She loved it as much as we did.  My memory isn't as strong as it should be, because I can't for the life of me recall the names of what we tried (but I will upload a pic), all I know is it was all great, fresh and tasty as you can find.   We will be back next time we are over that way."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff and great service! Hidden gem in the University City area. Must try the Volcano and Colorado Rolls. Yum!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in the North Charlotte area! The thump roll is my favorite!"}
{"text":"We were a little confused on the process of how to order but the food was awesome. Service was excellent and fast!"}
{"text":"Great small sushi place.  Friendly staff.  Excellent sushi for the price.  Hibachi meals are better than most and the price is hard to beat.  Current specials include $10 for hibachi dinner and a maki roll.  I recommend it to those who look for good sushi at decent prices.  Drinks are also diverse.  Good selection of saki.  If you live near Highland Creek it is a must try."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical after another review claiming the \"best\" sushi in Charlotte, but after stopping in, it's darn close!  The ingredients were fresh, the preparation was quick, and the presentation was top notch.  The special rolls they concoct here all sound and look amazing.  I chose the Heather roll, and it was a work of art!  Delicious, too!  I went on to try a the hibachi steak and chicken, rice and noodles as the sides.  The prices were more than reasonable for the amount of food served, and it was all very tasty.  The service was great, and the gents working were all very pleasant. With over 20 special rolls, I have a feeling I'll be getting my \"You're a Regular!\" check mark here PDQ! Noosh"}
{"text":"Great food. Local business. Great people. Small and hidden away, this is my go-to on the way home, or a quiet local place after golf. This the kind of sushi place you wish you had next to your house. I do. So there!  Update on best roll per another user - It's going to have to be the Tanaka roll - obviously obvious. Also, the Knock Off is choice. But really, just ask the owner (he's usually the one rolling) and he'll make something special for you."}
{"text":"Friendly people. However, the food was very disappointing. The spicy tuna roll had no flavor. The Eel Bowl was pretty boring. Just eel and rice, no vegetables and a few of the eel pieces were fatty. I love sushi and went here based on reviews but man, this could have been better. We ordered as takeout."}
{"text":"I love this place!  While it may not try to be a high end sushi place ...it doesn't have to. They have great rolls, hibachi, and the staff make the time there enjoyable.   I sit at the sushi bar now and the place kinda feels like my own \"Cheers\" at times. Lol  Great staff, great food, and good times makes this little spot a treasured gem in a neighborhood void of fun places to go!"}
{"text":"Definitely not $50 worthy! Pretty slow service, but hey there's more sushi bars to try around the area."}
{"text":"The food was amazing...reasonably priced.  The Wakame and Crab Salad was out of this world.  The Tanaka combo and hibachi combo are enough for four people to share.  Everything was fabulous and the service was great."}
{"text":"I walked in, not having high hopes, considering this place looks nothing like the hibachi and sushi places I'm used to. We decided to give it a shot, because hey, it's close to home, why not? I was pleasantly surprised. While it's not the absolute best sushi I've ever had, it's still pretty good. The midori roll was very tasty. I also like that they offer kid's meals, as our 2 year old has yet to appreciate the joys of sushi. (It also cuts back on cost since our 8 year old *is* a sushi freak.) Sure, if you're going into it with the expectations of a \"sushi expert\" you might be disappointed. But if you approach it with an open mind, you might like it. The staff is super friendly too, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Anyone who thinks any of what Tanaka has to offer is Japanese food is sorely mistaken. This \"hibachi\" nonsense is a total Caucasian invention. Literally the worst food I've ever eaten, and I'm pretty sure they gave my daughter food poisoning. It's terrible...I don't know who all these people are that like it, but they've obviously never eaten REAL Japanese food, because the garbage they offer is about as tasty and authentically Japanese as McDonald's. I miss Hamikaze, Sushi Mac and Mushi in Los Angeles. I can't wait to get back to CA to get some ACTUAL Japanese food!"}
{"text":"The food is just okay but very pricey .  The restaurant is so dirty . The salt and pepper shaker hasn't been cleaned in months . The restaurant needs a mop and rag and an update to charge the current prices"}
{"text":"Great sushi in the Highland Creek area. Great prices and very good sushi & Hibachi. Love it"}
{"text":"We were not satisfied. We ordered a take out dinner- a hibachi dinner and a Red dragon roll. The chicken hibachi did not have a lot of meat, maybe like 10 little pieces, it was more like eating noodles than eating chicken and noodles as a side. The yum yum sauce was not home made and therefore tasted stale. The food was cold. The sushi roll cost $10 but we got something small and in other restaurants it would cost like $6.We were very disappointed with the food we got. We won't order anything from there again."}
{"text":"PLEASE READ this entirely, it will change your mind on going. There are so many other better sushi places to go to, please don't make the mistake of choosing this one as your destination. Tonight was the third time we've tried to like this place, and just like the first two visits:fail and I was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED by what we witnessed this time.      I'll start off positive first. Honestly, the food itself is actually decent. Not my favorite, but I have absolutely no complaints on the taste of the food for each visit. I love seaweed salad and they actually give you a great portion of seaweed and no lettuce to boot(which some places do to skimp out on seaweed). This is the only reason I gave them two stars instead of one.      So, here's how tonight's visit went... Order at the register. No problem. Cost is high-ordering sushi I can get that, as tuna and other ingredients do get rather expensive. Still, ok. Pay for the meal and your tip for the server before you've even been served... Umm ok?        As it's the only cool night in a long time for a Charlotte summer, after ordering I ask if it's ok if we sit on the patio-it actually wasn't a request, I was just nicely putting that we were going to be outside if they needed to find us-I was told they had already shut down the patio. Ummm you have over an hour until close and I just saw people out there as we walked in... ok? And then the server proceeded to yell to the ?manager? \"I'm going to shut down the patio now.\" Sooooo the patio was open until I asked? And with over an hour of service left? Slightly peeved, we took a seat at the booth.         Not that I really care about how a place looks, but the scenery is sub par. As we sit, we happen to notice the sanitation score***90***Yikes. Which in turn normally means 88, as a two point forgiveness is given if they are servesafe certified. That's scary.         Ok, on to the sitting and waiting. Spring rolls came out first, which do have to be fried, so can take some time-understood, happy. My friend ordered those and I ordered seaweed salad as a starter. Newsflash-no place makes their seaweed salad in house, they buy it in bulk and literally plop it on a plate. The seaweed salad came probably 5-7min after the springrolls. Ok, maybe they thought we were sharing and wanted to space out our meal-HIGHLY doubt that, but I'll play fair. At this point, my friends drink is completely out and we share my water. Just as a test, we didn't ask for a refill just to see what would happen....        Waited more and finally a server dropped off what we thought was my sushi-the Fuji roll. They always seem to deviate from what their menu says on their sushi everytime we come here, and again tonight they left off the massago. I love massago, one of the reasons I chose that roll, so we set it to the side to wait and ask. And wait. And wait. Finally my friend hails down a server to ask which roll this was-she didn't know. I told her I did order mine without the panko fried bits(so understandable if she didn't recognize it) and I was pretty sure it was mine but missing massago, but she seemed to think it wasn't even the fugi roll, apologized and took it away. No problem, everything normal... UNTIL SHE TURNED AND PUT IT DOWN ON THE BOOTH NEXT TO US' TABLE, and served it to them!!!!!!! What?!?!?!?!? All my years I've NEVER seen this done and was at an utter loss of words. My friend had to physically stop me from going to the booth next to us and telling them what she just did, and I STILL feel guilty for not doing so. They looked like they were on a first date or some thing. Appalled! Absolutely appalled! It's not like we touched it or anything, but ummmm I'm just getting over a super bad cold and we were talking overtop of it and it had been sitting on our table for a good solid 10 minutes. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. At this point, I'm solidified in the fact I will NEVER be back.     Then we waited for our food, got my friend's two sushi rolls and then waited more for mine to come. When it came 5 minutes later, it was the same exact roll as the one they gave away. Again, no massago. Immediately, we asked the server why it didn't have massago (bc we'd never see her again otherwise) and she took it back to the chef who made it seem like we WANTED massago-ummm no it's on the menu that way. Does anyone on your staff know your menu?? It never changes...      Finished our food quickly. Had to get up and go find someone for a to go box. No refill ever. No \"did everything turn out ok\" after the first send back. No nothing. It would've been more pleasant to have gone to Harris teeter and picked up Togo sushi and eaten at home. With the amount of money we had spent, we could've gone to fresh market, gotten the same thing, better experience  and even bought a bottle of wine to boot.       Bottom line, ABSOLUTELY disgusted with the whole experience and will NEVER be back, even if you paid me. Still wish I would've warned our booth neighbors.."}
{"text":"Great little gem!  Trying to branch out in my lunch options, I found myself a Tanaka Grill and Sushi.    Decided to order sushi, but their other options on the menu look promising as well.  The prices are pretty good for the flavors you get.  I ordered two rolls and got away with a $12 bill... which is not too shabby at all since the other sushi places in Charlotte will end up being double the price after 2 rolls.  There wasn't much of a lunch rush so their staff seems a bit bare bones, but it works - gives a bit of a relaxed, casual experience.  Just what I need for my lunch hour to decompress a bit from the morning.  Can't wait to go back and try their bowl options since it comes with a bowl of miso soup and was delicious and filling according to my co-worker."}
{"text":"Good local spot I can walk to. Food is 3.5 to 4 stars but the service is one star if you dine-in. I usually order via phone and pickup, but came in one night to sit with my girlfriend. We were ignored for 10-15 minutes.  After we gave the waitress about five dirty looks, she came over and huffed and puffed while she took our drink order and rudely said we can order our entrees at the cash register. As if we were supposed to know that without instruction...For the first time in about five years, I gave a 10% tip as this was purely unacceptable. If she took our order and served us it would have been 20-25%. Her loss!"}
{"text":"I ordered a long time ago from this place but I did not enjoy the food. I decided to try again and looked at the website  for the menu. Apparently the menu hasnt been updated in a long time. When I called in the order I was given  a total that was much higher than anticipated.  I called back and cancelled. I am not sure I will try a third time."}
{"text":"Super nice people and willing to help if you have any questions. Really simple and good sushi. My one suggestion to them would be to have a less salty dip for the gyoza. Otherwise, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hibachi and/or Teriyaki Chicken meal is much better than other similar restaurants in the area.  Going to eat there again today for lunch, pretty pumped!"}
{"text":"Best sushi for the price in the area by far. The hibachi is ok but i really just go for the sushi. I eat here atleast once a week and have NEVER been upset. The owner is almost always there and he or his brother have made my sushi everytime i have been. They are always very nice to me and my wife."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, reasonable prices, and great service from a friendly staff. You can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly staff. Good place for yummy, cheap sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi and Food quality makes up for the unassuming ambience. The employees and sushi chef does a amazing job. If they changed the furniture a little and focused on rounding it out it would be 5 Stars"}
{"text":"Five years ago I took my fiancé here for a date because it was near us and had great reviews. Back then the owners were great and the food was awesome!  We moved to the other side of town when we got married and hadn't been back until tonight.   We drove an hour to come here and we were not disappointed. I'm glad to see the standard is still high! The sushi is great, the atmosphere is very laid back, and the prices are very fair.   I think we will need to make this a more regular experience!"}
{"text":"Food is still great. Service is good.  They could improve consistency on serving size. You just never know how much food you're gonna get, sometimes you get three pieces of mushroom and a good serving of carrots, sometimes more mushrooms than chicken, sometimes justa a couple of pieces of carrots. Timing is also inconsistent, sometimes food take 5minutes, sometimes 25. I'm a gambler, and their food tastes good so I keep coming back lol"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but multiple people (read other reviews) not getting correct food they're ordering and spending $30-40 on food is NOT ok. Second time getting food to-go and no mushrooms. Just broccoli and extra carrots...UGH!   It's a shame because the food is good."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with this restaurant. We ordered steak hibachi with noodles. First, the noodles were spaghetti noodles, not Asian noodles. The meat was dry, chewy and tasteless. For the money, I've had a far better experience down the street at Toyama Express."}
{"text":"This is a great small restaurant. While it doesn't have a lot of seating that is not important to me since I always take home my food. The rolls are always fresh.  I call ahead my orders and they are pretty accurate in their wait times. On Wednesday the wait times are usually long which I assume is due to the roll special. That is the day I most often go to take advantage. I have had the chicken dinner before and it was good as well."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Very friendly. Hot women for scenery. Great food. Complex favors. I'm filled up and completely satisfied. Shrimp sauce is amazing. Put it on your rice. And dip your sushi in it.   Truck driver here. I crave sushi all the time and this place hit the spot. Seriously. Every time I roll through Charlotte, I'll be eating here."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Tanaka.  Today, the sushi was divine, esp. because it was half off (Mondays and Wednesdays).  I personally enjoyed the Botz (crab).  I especially enjoy their fried rice.  I think it is some of the best in the Charlotte area.  Service was fast and friendly.  The restaurant was just beginning to become busy after we ordered.  The atmosphere was family-oriented so a good time was had by all.  Check out my photos."}
{"text":"We stopped in to Tanaka's once about, oh I dunno, maybe 2 years ago & we said we'd never be back since the food was no good.  Well, as fate would have it,I had stopped @ the Circle K across the street to get gas and was planning on going down Prosperity a bit to grab some quick Chinese.  But upon glancing at their sign I thought, \"what the heck, I'll give them a shot,\" suddenly craving Japanese over Chinese.  THAT MUST HAVE BEEN GOD SPEAKING TO ME!!!  FOOD:  I placed my to go order, going with the chicken/shrimp hibachi combo ($11) and chose rice and sweet carrots as my sides (choices are fried rice, sweet carrots, noodles or veggies).  My expectations were very low, and I was pretty sure I just wasted twelve bucks & change after she rang me up.  Driving home I figured I would have to find an alternative option.  I get home, love on my dogs, and begin preparing my meal (I'm picky in that I have to separate all my items; don't like things to \"mingle!\").  Get out a \"real\" fork, pour myself something to drink & begin eating.  FANTASTIC!!!  I shoveled that food in like I hadn't eaten in days.  And I wanted MORE.  Although it's important to note their food is very filling...I simply wanted more b/c it was SO tasty.  Since my early teens, Kubuto has always reigned supreme with me for Japanese.  Tanaka is a VERY VERY close second now...virtually tied w/Kabuto (and the great thing is, they're very close to our house).  As picky as I am, that's a big compliment.  Convinced my partner to try them again & now he's hooked.  We almost went bankrupt eating here so often in the following weeks!  Alas, we've finally backed off a little, but it wasn't easy.  AMBIENCE:  Nowhere near as good as the food.  Nothing has changed since that visit a few years ago.  One big change they need to make is to add more seating.  Been there several times, both at lunch and dinner, and often it's a standing room only situation...just waiting for someone to leave! They do have two large flat-screens showing two different things which is nice (but often the sound is off).  As I mentioned in my ISHI review, they have a kind of \"design on a dime\" look, as though they had only $500-$1,000 to fully outfit the place.  I do kind of like their retro style high pub tables & swivel stools; an interesting alternative to the standard table & chairs (plus it isn't expected in a Japanese restaurant).  Overall it's fairly sparse, but not horribly so.  Just needs a little sprucing up.  See photos.  SERVICE:  In general everyone is very friendly & you're greeted when you walk in the door, with a genuine \"happy to see you\" feel.  Only encountered one young woman that wasn't overly friendly...just sort of \"there.\"  But that didn't ruin my experience that day (she certainly couldn't be classed as rude).  You do often have to wait a bit, but it's worth it.  They only have one large hibachi grill I believe, so they prepare meals in the order they're received, and they apologize for the wait most of the time (that's something I appreciate and expect when I've had to wait a while for something when that's not the norm).   The only negative thing I have to say about Tanaka's is that their website is in DIRE need of an upgrade.  It has that look/feel of a site that was created by an employee that 'just so happens to dabble' in computers from time to time & saved them from paying a 3rd party to do the work.  So give Tanaka's a try if you haven't - I think you'll be quite pleased.  It's great to have such a savory option in the Eastfield area. :)"}
{"text":"Best Sushi around and much better lunch hibachi than the other local competitors. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"When I first move to Charlotte my roommates took me here, They ordered a Tanaka Tower and I ordered a few rolls. Since then I have always been a fan of this place, I am a regular and I enjoy pretty much every sushi roll they have there. Unfortunately I can't say anything about the hibachi since I have never tried it. The rolls are to good to avoid. As for the staff I can't complain they are awesome, plus they give a family vibe which makes this small corner restaurant feel very welcoming! and warm."}
