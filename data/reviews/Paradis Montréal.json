{"text":"We were walking on st denis street to find a terasse because finally it was sunny and 14 degrees celcius in Montreal. But they were all full. Finaly we arrived in front of Paradis Montreal and checked out their menu and it looked very good. They had the special 2 cocktails for 10$. We also ordered empanadas, calamari and the fish and shrimp tacos. It was sooooo good!!! Amazing place with nice latin music!"}
{"text":"I've been searching Montréal for Mexican food and came across Paradis. The food is different than what you will find in most traditional establishments in the city. It's part fusion, but wholly inspired by Mexico and the Caribbean. For dinner we had the choriqueso, tacos pastor, and enchiladas de molé. All of it was really good. Thoroughly enjoyed the various salsa as well. Good service! A hidden gem on St-Denis."}
{"text":"Terrific food, very reasonable prices.  The tacos are terrific.  I had the Al Pastor and chicken tacos (4 for $10); my husband had the fish and shrimp tempura tacos.  They were all outstanding."}
{"text":"Super petit resto mexicain idéalement situé sur St Denis entre Mont Royal et Marie-Anne. Large choix de bouffe et de drinks, à des prix très abordables. Entre 5 et 7, 2 drinks pour 10$. Il y a de la bouffe originale comme du cactus (excellent) ou encore la soupe de tortillas (excellente aussi!!). La prochaine fois, je goûterai la soupe de fruits de mer ou la paella! ou bien des tacos!! hihi ça donne envie d'y retourner plusieurs fois! Allez y!!!"}
{"text":"What a great little place with amazing deals most nights of the week!   We each started with a margarita - from 5 to 7, you get two drinks for $10! It was tasty. We shared the hummus ranchero, which was interesting. It was like a chunky black bean dip. I loved the fish and shrimp taco plate - very flavourful and filling. My husband had 4 tacos - they were tasty but pretty small. We really enjoyed the salsas and peppers that were served with the meal. The spicy items added a nice kick to the meal. We finished with the fried ice cream, which was excellent.  Service was very friendly. One knock is that there is no interior door, and it was cold near the front of restaurant as people went in an out.   I will definitely be back during the week to try the many specials!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was so fun and entertaining with the live music and everyone getting up to dance. The food was amazing, and it displayed authenticity  from it decor to the ambiance. I would defiantly recommend trying this place if you're looking to have a joyful night."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: You'll have no problem spotting the restaurant as you're walking down the street. It's super colorful both inside and out.   FOOD: The food was pretty good! All the way from the appetizers to the desserts. We ordered 4 for 10$ tacos (one of each flavor offered) and they were all yummy. It was my first time having cactus which was surprisingly good! The sharing plate was good as well. Some items were a bit too bland for my taste. However, their jalapeno poppers and quesadillas were delicious.  PRICE: Prices are decent. They often have specials for everyday of the week which is cool. And they always have their 5 a 7 drink deal (2 for 10$). The only downside to this was that we couldn't split the deal between two people which I found ridiculous.  SERVICE: The staff was very friendly. Always there to assist you and make sure that everything was to your liking."}
