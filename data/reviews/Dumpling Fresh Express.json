{"text":"This is now a dumpling restaurant and the food is awesome!!! Prices are very reasonable and the food tastes authentic. We got the pork+cabbage steamed dumplings, pork+shrimp+chives steamed dumplings, yuxian eggplant and the garlic cucumbers. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Avoid beef noodle in this place! It is a disaster. The soup simply tasted like contaminated tap water with oil. The beef is very hard to chew."}
{"text":"I took a risk at ordering their 15 dumpling order where you get to pick 3 different types of dumplings.  The problem is, when you get it for take out you have no clue whats in each one so it's more dumpling roulette when eating them because they all look the same!  Also the wait took way longer than anticipated on Ritual. I wasn't a fan of waiting for a good chunk of my lunch just to eat it at my desk."}
