{"text":"I'm from CA, came to visit my bro and his fam.  Decided to try this place after checking out all the good reviews on Yelp. Was NOT  disappointed!! Pizza was great, fresh crust. The wings tho! I don't like my wings soft or soggy and these were a perfect balance of crispiness and flavor!! And to top it off the had great service as well!! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"everyone should try this local Gem!! Called to place an order, someone suggested i change size of pizza that then allowed 1 topping for a savings of $8.00. He also suggested the buffalo fries that were awesome!! Can't wait to keep trying different items on the menu.  Definitely try this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Buffalo Chicken pizza was delicious! The flavor wasn't overpowering and the chicken had a real nice crisp to it. Definitely recommend this pizza to anyone. Had Venezias yesterday and this blew that place right out of the water."}
{"text":"Came in from out of town and were treated like royalty!   Delicious food, great service, and wonderful atmosphere!  Thank you, Vincent."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing and the owners are beyond friendly! I love family owned joints like this one."}
{"text":"I love philly cheesesteaks and I have searched all over for a great sandwich.  I saw a ad on facebook for rockys and decided to give it a shot.  I got the provolone philly cheesesteak  and the cheese breadsticks.    When the breadsticks were brought out I was blown away,  basically its a pizza, they were just AWESOME.   When my sandwich came out, the first thing I noticed was the size and portion of the meat.  excellent portions.  I couldnt get enough the flavor was so good.   I will for sure be back.  I just recently saw that they added a cheese steak fries.   sounds really GOOD..   The service was Great.  Im picky on how I am served and treated.   They treated us like family from the minute we walked in the door."}
{"text":"This place has renewed my hopes again. Chatted with the owner and found out that there was a new person working there that didn't quite have a handle on the recipe yet and with how fast they have blown up they are very understaffed. Tried their new spicy Italian sausage and got a free pizza for my troubles. Both pizzas were perfect like I got them previously. Top notch customer service. Will be coming back again for sure."}
{"text":"Saw the ad on Facebook and was excited to try a new Pizza place, was a little disappointed, ordered delivery, took about an hour or so, the garlics knots were good, but a little dry, I'm sure if the pizza was hotter, it would've been amazing. It was warm, had to put it in the microwave."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem across the street from my office  and have gotten lunch a few times. They have great lunch specials! For $6 I had a soda, French fries & an extremely large size slice of pizza. They're so nice & quick with their service. Definitely recommend to snore in the area."}
{"text":"Being from out of state,wanted some pizza and wings. Came upon this place through the app. Had good ratings so said let's give it a try. Great Pizza and great wings!! Also very awesome customer service, owner came out and introduced himself and made experience even better. Really recommend this place if your in the Tempe, Mesa area."}
{"text":"Not good. Just spent $18 on stringy Philly cheese steak and soggy day-old fries. The pizza is great, so this really surprised me."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, decent pizza. No complaints. The crimped crust is a nice touch!   I love ranch with my pizza and I swear I use a whole cup of their ranch per slice it is so good!"}
{"text":"Thanks Brandon! $5.99 slice from a 28\" pizza  w/ fountain drink... Pretty fun giant novelty slice. Cost friendly overall worth it taste great. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for my first time and I will be back! Everything, Pizza, burger and garlic knots were amazing!! I highly recommend the pesto burger with bacon."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! John was helpful, funny, and suggested food that was amazing! So glad we went here, would suggest to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Pizza, wings, onion rings, fries, but especially the cheesesteak, and that's coming from someone who generally doesn't prefer cheesesteaks. Soooooo goood. You won't regret it! The fact they've only been opened just a few months and already have so many high reviews is proof itself. And the fact it is open until 3am on those weekends is awesome! If you're out drinking you won't regret taking a taxi/Uber to this place after the bar for that post hang out feast! We tried to call in an order but were unable to get through and worried the posted hours were wrong. The food looked so great tho that we decided to drive by to check anyways. They were! When we attempted an order through Yelp it listed an hour prep time....and Yelp as a company cancelled the order unfortunately. Once we got there and ordered we were driving off with it in only about 15 to 20 minutes! Just don't order through yelp or it may get cancelled. Try GrubHub or just call it in! :)"}
{"text":"Small venue with table seating for twenty along with window seating! Authentic and ever so fresh ingredients! Well worth the wait for such an excellent pizza! We will certainly return SOON!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in the valley. The boneless wings are delicious and the people are all cool. I'm a fight fan so the atmosphere is perfect. Eaten here twice and I don't plan on eating pizza anywhere else anymore!"}
{"text":"I'm a Bostonian who has lived in N.Y., TX, .CA, and AZ, The pizza slices are HUGE, the steak and cheese, crazy and delicious(in the evenings) and nice people. Good food!"}
{"text":"Ate here tonight had the big Philly cheesesteak Excellent best Philly cheesesteak I've had since I left Pennsylvania it's a must try"}
{"text":"We were hungry and looking for a late night fix. We stumbled across this place and saw that they closed at midnight, soo we arrived at 10pm.   The dining area is very small and it's all carpet... the cashier was friendly and he quickly came up to us and asked us if we were ready. It being our first time in we took our time and did some looking over the menu first.   We decided to order a large pizza and a medium drink. The menu is pretty big and they do have a lot of items you can order from. We paid about $17.   All the pizzas come with cheese and the toppings are extra. The pizza slices are big and there are pictures of the pizza sizes up on the wall.   The employee brought out the pizza to us along with some parmesan cheese, ranch, and chili pepper.   The pizza was delicious. The crust was great and the cheese was sooooo gooey, yumm!!!!   We were eating and saw that the employees went to the back. The phone kept ringing and ringing and no one would come to answer it. It was only about 10:35pm and so I'm assuming someone was calling to place an order. The cashier finally came around to the front and he didn't bother picking up the phone she though it was still ringing.  We finished eating around 11pm and the employee had already turned off the open sign. We walked out at 11:10 and when we looked back the lights inside were already off..  The sign said midnight and so does their hours on yelp, but it made feel like maybe the closing time is actually 11pm? Oh well idk..... Next time I do want some yummy pizza though, I will make sure I walk in much earlier!   Four stars because the pizza is great yoooo!"}
{"text":"Great people, great food, great deals. \"Knock out slice\" is more like 3 and a drink for $5.99 cant beat it."}
{"text":"Great food, super nice people... love the slices, the Phillys and the cranberry pecan salad rocks!! Go, you'll be happy.,..nuff said  Just an update... still great pie, open late, and really the nicest people. I always spend my loot at independents... not a Pizza Hut or god forbid...Papa John's, yeesh, what a tool THAT guy is! I digress... try it , you'll love it...Peace..."}
{"text":"Wish I could add a star. This place is fantastic. The only thing better then the food is the genuine customer service I received on my visits. Pizza is insane awesome."}
{"text":"Love this New Place! Omg, Henry and I will be back! Definitely ! Rocky's Philly and the mushroom... mmmm.. crunchy fries. Great hospitality from the owners!! Must try! Will not be disappointed!!  Can't wait to try the Pizza next. ;)"}
{"text":"We came here after checking for pizza joints and this place caught our eye. We had a Rocky's Original Philly Cheesesteak ($9.99) and a 16\" Supreme ($18.99).    After a short ride home where the new car smell was over-powered by the smell of hot fresh food, we sat down for dinner. My Philly cheesesteak was satisfying. It had that liquid cheese sauce and lots of meat. Portions were good and it was easy to put it all down. The pizza was on the flimsier side. Toppings would slip around and doing a pizza fold was pretty much impossible.  This place was overall decent. I wouldn't mind coming back for another Philly cheesesteak or to try their oven baked fries."}
{"text":"Hangry & now happy with our 1st visit to Rocky's Pizza & Cheesesteaks (+ they deliver and are open until 3a Fri. & Sat. Scooore!)  Jalapeno Philly - juicy, had a bite, but not too spicy. *Brought Nate back to his Jersey days!*  Buffalo chicken pizza + dope crust!  Chicken bacon ranch fries  All yummy selections! Toby & Vince were super friendly as well! Wonderful 1st experience. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I were at a photo shoot late and ended up ordering from here since they deliver late.  Let me tell you, BEST CHEESESTEAK AND PIZZA in town! We couldn't stop raving about how amazing the food and taste was, food got in very hot.   Definitely will be back for more! Ate so fast didn't even have time for a picture, that's how good it was!"}
{"text":"Ordered pick up for lunch and had a great experience. The owner was a really great guy to meet, he made everyone feel welcome. Very apologetic when things were taking longer than normal, but it was no problem. Had a pepperoni and jalapeño pizza and wings. Pizza was great and I loved the crust! And wings were tasty and had a spicy kick to them which I loved! Will be coming back for sure, glad I work just down the street from them."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying Rocky's has the B E S T customer service . It's been a very long time since I've gone somewhere and decided that I'll become a regular customer just based off of their customer service. The food is delicious ! I ordered a Mushroom philly without onions , asked for extra mushrooms instead of grilled onions & Toby made it happen without a problem. I also ordered a slice of K.O pepperoni slice which was not only huge , but it was also delicious, which is great being that I don't really care for pizza. I met both Toby & Vince and they were both very nice and welcoming . I will definitely be going back . If I could give 10 stars , I would !"}
{"text":"AWESOME SAUCE!!!! Greeted w/a smile by a warm friendly woman who's name o meant to get. Beautiful blonde you see in  h pics. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak w/provolone onions peppers and mushroom- it's was PERFECT! Taste like 215 and I was born and raised in the 215! Also had the cheeseburger fries. Super good too. Love the lettuce tomato and pickle toppings. I will be back and tell anyone reading this to try them out! Inside is a nice cozy sit down and catch some sports atmosphere. Family friendly too."}
{"text":"Some of the best Pizza in the east valley! The staff is extremely nice and the service is outstanding. I would recommend Rocky's to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great new hole in the wall for Dobson Ranch. Cool family vibe and mega slices with great sandwiches. None Corp feel. Awesome place"}
{"text":"This is a convenient little pizzeria just outside of our neighborhood.  The owner was friendly and the establishment was your classic pizza joint.  We brought 4 of our kids with us and to watched a little football while waiting.  We were able to fill all 6 of our tummies with two 24\" freshly baked pizzas.  Psst, in case you ever need to serve for a large birthday party, they offer 28\" pizza.  I know this is where I am going to go for my next kid birthday party for sure!!  Looking forward to coming to try their calzones and Philly Cheesesteaks!!!"}
{"text":"Rockys Pizza is an awesome pizza joint! I stopped by with my wife late Saturday night looking for a slice...They hooked it up with one of there knockout slices to go (Pepperoni & jalapeño) The pizza was great, thin crust, nice and crispy. Plus Toby and Vince were super cool. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"So I ordered the Honey/Hot wings, 25 count, and the Provolone PhillyCheese. All delivery. I paid 41.00 this. First off the wings were DRYYYY, SUUUUUPPPERR DRY, for those that like their wings with sauce, this place is not with the saucy-ness. There was barely any sauce for the wings, the fries were soft, not fresh, almost baked like. And the Philly?? A lot of steak, but what happened to the cheese?? Could've sworn cheese, onions, maybe even green peppers, suppose to go on the sandwich as well."}
{"text":"So, so, so good! I also was very impressed with their customer service. There was a mix-up with another customers order. And instead of calling her up to the counter to discuss. They came out, went to the table she was sitting at, explained the mix-up and gave a gift card for her next visit. That type of ownership and service means a lot to me. Things happen, and Rocky's blew it out of the park! Well done gang. And did I mention my Mushroom Philly was the bomb??? Yeah, made my day."}
{"text":"Clean upbeat environment, the owners were super friend. Chicken wings were perfectly crispy and juicy."}
{"text":"We've tried this place a couple times, despite reservations after multiple name & ownership changes (mostly out of convenience). Tonight when we tried to order take out we were passed amongst three workers- We were greeted by a female who was helping us out but then wasn't sure about the menu so she passed us on to a cook. He was trying to be helpful, but his efforts were quickly over powered when the woman originally talking to us shooed both him & us aside so she could answer a phone call. An older third woman came out, asked us the same question that the gentleman helping us out had just asked, and then proceeded to shout \"ugh ok, now I'm just confused!\" she walked away into the back. I should also mention we were just ordering a buffalo chicken salad and the question was fried or grilled chicken... Needless to say we left without ordering & will not return. Disappointing considering it's so close by I could walk there."}
{"text":"A truly authentic cheesesteak! I've been back from Philly for three years and I've had a lot of good cheesesteaks here but this takes the cake. Amazing bread, great steak and whiz. If you want imitations go somewhere else this is THE place for a good steak!"}
{"text":"First time ordering delivery from Rocky's Pizza through The Yelp app. What an awesome experience! I was able to pay on the app, add tip for the driver and the service was fast. The food was good, tasty and the sauce for the honey bbq wings was excellent."}
{"text":"If I was a stoner 18 year old, I guess that would make me cool nuff to talk to?? But being 46, apparently isn't going to get recognized. Lol. Pizza was edible. Barely."}
{"text":"So yummy! I love the big slice of pizza and they give you a cute pizza cutter with it. Coming here again after an ASU game."}
{"text":"This place has really good pizza! The staff is friendly & they were pretty quick. I felt bad for the owner/ manager. Some man with a dog ( NO LEASH) came in. He was harassing the owner because the owner asked him to leave. The man started yelling at the owner. The owner was very nice & professional. That won't stop me from coming in. Great prices, service & food!"}
{"text":"Me and my family are frequent customers to Rocky's! There are usually 8 of us so imagine how much it cost to feed all of us.. Not at Rocky's! We order their gigantic 28\" pizza and we all get full for under $50.00 with delivery! The pizza is amazing and cooked perfectly :) thanks to everyone at Rocky's for giving us such amazing food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"This place is great, the rockys original cheesesteak is off the chain and the mushroom philly is bomb as well. I highly recommend this place, great service and great food also the pizza slice off a 28\" pizza is huge. We will definitely return"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery thru doordash for the first time and the delivery was fast and the food was great. Pizzas, stuffed mushrooms, beef sandwich, all awesome."}
{"text":"Wow this is a gem in the wall. Don't be fooled by the appearance of the location, it's the best damn pizza I ever had. These guys pizza slices is huge like my whole forearm. Got 1 slice of supreme pizza 5 wings and drink only 12 dollars. Normal slice wing drink only cost you 8.99. The wings are crispy and juice and the pizza is delicious creamy but not greasy. The crust has a butter aroma to it with a hint of garlic. Update: this pizza is huge and I barely finished it. I could eat a whole little Caesar myself so go figure. Did I mention that I came in late at night expecting heat lamp pizza, but instead everything is made fresh. No heat lamp dried out pizza"}
{"text":"In this corner, our order weighing in at $6.99 for a large 1 topping 14\" pizza (which I thought that was big). And in the other corner is Rocky's knockout pizza coming in at 28\"... Yeah, if I ate that whole pizza by myself I would definitely be KO'd. We started off on the ropes with Rocky's Pizza after being put on hold for almost 5 minutes. We eventually threw in the towel, hung up, called them back and successfully ordered. Pick up was a bit of a wait as it was a Saturday. Clearly, a busy time for them so plan ahead especially if there is a big game on TV that night. Portions are HUGE and the dough is chewy. They seem like a family business that really enjoys what they are doing. So glad Rocky's decided to throw their hat into the pizza ring!"}
{"text":"Omgosh I have been searching for a good philly cheese steak this place tops it. We are in absolutely love great flavor good size and great price. We can't wait to try their pizza and other items.. Very friendly when I walked in.. They will be seeing us more often worth the drive."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have a good pizza place (finally!!) in the Dobson Ranch area! My boyfriend and I are a little particular about pizza and ranch, ridiculous I know, but this place is so good! The sauce, the cheese, the crust, the ranch, the customer service for take out! A+ in my book and we will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Some of the best I've had in Mesa. Staff is super friendly as well. Can't wait to try a cheesesteak"}
{"text":"We ordered a cheese pizza, jalapeño cheesesteak and an original cheesesteak low carb style (no bread). And, it was delicious, lots of flavor and they load it with the grilled onions and peppers. Sooooo much better than the other place that gets good reviews, Forefathers. The pizza had a ton of cheese and my family said it was so yummy. The lady that took our order was very nice too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a classic-style neighborhood place. It's very clean, comfortable and the folks working there are friendly and made me feel at ease on my first visit.  (If they're reading: I was the guy that couldn't make up my mind this afternoon.)  I decided on the Provolone Philly steak. It was awesome! Stuffed with steak. Stuffed full. Like enough for two subs. Good meat, cooked to perfection, with just enough seasoning that you could tell it was there, but not enough to overpower the steak's great flavors. Lots of melted provolone, sauteed onions and peppers. Perfect! Don't call me a piggy, but I ate the whole thing on the way home. It was simply incredible. Thank you Rocky's. Thank you. I wish I lived closer, but it's on my way home from my part-time job, so I'll visit again. That giant pizza on the menu was calling my name....."}
{"text":"I think I may have written one previous review in the 3 or so years I have had yelp. The customer service at this place was phenomenal!!! The owner, Tobi, was so welcoming and helpful. She definitely made the experience a good one. The food was awesome. Seriously, the pizza is to die for. The fresh herbs and garlic oiled crust is my paradise. We also got the provolone Philly and the jalapeno Philly and they were both a thumbs up. The bone-in wings had the perfect crunch. I give this place 5 stars because of the Food and customer service!! Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.I love Rocky's,like a brother.it says I have to keep righting more words so my review will be posted.zi guees that did it."}
{"text":"Their website says they opened at 2pm (which seems late for a restaurant to open)  showed up and doors are locked. We got in the car and I noticed someone was inside. They told us they opened at 3. Makes me question how long they will remain open."}
{"text":"They were short staffed. But the staff was awesome. Owner (Toby)--Awesome. Vincent--Awesome.  I was out with my friend Gary and with plenty of time on my hands. You know the situation, where you see folks pressed for time and wonder what their issue is. Gary and I were just out catching up.  There was a kerfuffle with some impatient customers. It was handled with Jersey-style grace. \"Here's some fries on the house, how else can we help?\" The staff was very apologetic.. to them, to us, to everyone.  The owner, Toby, had just arrived from Vegas where she'd been watching her son in a baseball tourney. Near and dear to my heart because of daughter's journey to D1 basketball. Both she and Vincent were very attentive and concerned about our experience.  I ordered hot wings and a Jalapeno Philly, sans liquid chicken (mayo for you gross mayonaise lovers out there).  Both were very tasty.  That was the test. They passed with flying colors. Then Gary and I ordered 5 more phillys and a pizza. These would be going home to our families. Gotta tell ya folks: the pizza was the best this side of Prima Pizza's closing. Highly recommended.   I'm going back. I know Gary is headed back too. Maybe we'll go together again or bring our families. The whole experience was like a little slice of Jersey or New York. Take your pick, be happy, place an order, feel at home and enjoy.  More later. For now, thank you awesome people of Rocky's, DP"}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place a try! Group an7 came in and got a 28inch pizza and a buffalo chicken fries. Fries were bomb! We cut the 28 into 16 slices and still had 3 left over. Crust is amazing as well on the pizza! Owners make sure they greet all their customers and bring them back again. Cater to their customers nice customer service. Want to bring my Phillies friends back and check out their cheese steaks next times!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place and I felt like pizza... so I decided to try it out. And I'm glad for it. That was the biggest slice of pizza I've ever seen in my life. Taste great and very affordable. I live pretty far away but I'm pretty sure we gonna meet again"}
{"text":"So a couple of weeks ago i ordered a supreme pizza. Olives missing and toppings extremely skimpy. Not like the other supreme pizza's i have ordered there. I called the owner , he apologized and gave me a $5 credit.  I was good with that and hey.. things happens. I'm not unreasonable. So today i order another supreme pizza.  He gave me a total and i asked is that with my $5 credit. He (the owner) said i'm supposed to tell him that before i order. Very rudely. How am i supposed to know that?  So i pick it up and he gives me a total with a $2 credit. I said you told me $16.20 it should be 11.20 plus tax. He proceeds to tell me again i should tell him when i ordered. again rudely.  I said how am i supposed to know that? Did you tell me that when you gave me the credit? Did he think i forgot when he told me that on the phone 30 minutes earlier? Needless to say, i won't be returning . Oh and my pizza was like 1/2 cooked. So if you want rude service.. this is your place. I'll be going back to Joe's pizzeria down the block from them. everyone is extremely friendly there and the pizza there is awesome!"}
{"text":"Original east coaster living in Mesa here! This is by far my favorite local pizza place. Always have a good deal going but really it's my fav because of the pizza itself. True NY style. Plus it's family owned and they have cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick slice....the slice was the size of Cleveland and the crust was fantastic... crisp, flavorful and huuuge!!!  Sausage was perfect, fresh mushrooms and a dynamite sauce made from scratch!  A diamond in hiding is this place. Now every time we come to wash the dogs we'll drop in for a slice!  Great Job guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was super yummy.  As others mentioned the staff is really friendly!  I also like that the owner works evenings there as well.  It really shows she cares about her business and her customers.  Everyone liked the food!"}
{"text":"Great customer service with even better food! This is the best place For pizza, wings, and cheese steak"}
{"text":"Synopsis: Well done, Rocky's! Thank you for your awesome service and delicious food. I suspect we will be waging gladiator-style death matches for the leftovers.   Long Story: I don't even know where to begin. Every time I place an order anywhere, it gets messed up. Like, really messed up. Some places forget to bring half my order. Some places just never process an order. Sometimes I get charged twice. You name it. If someone's getting crappy service that night, it's going to be me. As long as the place is decent about it, I chalk it up to human error and move on with life. C'est la vie.   But, by now I've ordered from just about every pizza place anywhere near me and tonight I was craving some serious pizza and I hit Yelp looking for a new place to try. I found Rocky's and ordered just about one of everything: a basic thin-crust cheese pizza, a supreme, a calzone, some garlic knots, cheese bread, and some fried zucchini.   It took slightly more than an hour to get my food, but it was peak time on a Saturday night- the last free night before Halloween, so everybody is having parties and stuff. Totally understandable.   Unfortunately, when I got inside and started dishing up for my troops, I realized that the cheese pizza didn't get delivered. I called them up and got stuck on hold for a while, but, again, Saturday. Peak time. The guy who answered was really awesome. This is what really made my mind up about the place. Normally, when I call someplace to tell them something is wrong, I get a half-hearted \"oops,\" if anything at all. Actually, the last pizza joint that forgot one of my pizzas accused me of lying until they talked to their driver, and then they still didn't apologize even though the driver had my pizza in his car. Bah. Anyway, this guy seemed very genuine with his apology, and that means a lot. He also apologized for keeping me waiting, and offered several solutions for making things right. Ultimately, they did send their driver back out with pizza and he brought a free soda for the trouble, which was cool of them. I felt like he went above and beyond to correct the error.  I wish I could remember the man's name... I think it started with a \"V,\" but I really don't remember. He said he was the owner's fiancée. And there you have it. Someone who actually gives a sh*t is running the business. You don't get that kind of service unless the place is locally-owned and operated. Authentic concern. I am now a customer for life and will recommend them to anyone I talk to, solely because of that experience. Well, that and the food's good, but I haven't gotten there yet.  Pizzas: The pizzas were fantastic. The supreme was fully-loaded with high-quality ingredients. Word to the wise, though, if you aren't a fan of insanely-thick dough, go for the thin crust. The crust was good, but it was more bready than I prefer. Not wrong. Not poorly made. Just different than what I like. I liked the thin better.   Knots: Soooo delicious, but also massive. And very bready. Which sounds weird, I know. They're made of bread. And they're supposed to be. My troops loved them.   Cheese Bread: The cheese bread was to-die-for. I could eat that as my last meal and die happy.   Calzone: Oh. My. Word. It's called a \"Big ass calzone\" for a reason. It could feed a small army. Ok, really, I'm sure it could overfill 2-3 hungry adults. The whole reason I wanted Italian tonight was because I wanted ricotta. The thing was densely packed with ricotta and mozzarella and nothing else. Sauce was on the side. The kids thought the calzone was hilarious because you couldn't take a bite without leaving a long trail of cheese, and I seriously could have drunk the sauce by itself. But, I wouldn't have, because that would have made the calzone dry, and I wanted to eat some of that too. It was also delicious, by the way.  Fried Zucchini: Perfect. Not much else to say. Nothing abnormal or special about it. Just good fried zucchini.   That's that. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Are you tired of food that has been so simplified so that kids can make it and the owners can pay them minimum wage.... resulting in minimum flavor?  Of course you aren't.... because that's all you know.  At Rocky's today the owners were busting their butts putting their personal signature on the food.  Yes I've seen the FB ads and people talking about the female owner.... she works hard to make your food. So keep your sexist comments to yourself.  This is an old school prepared food. The juice / flavor coming out of the Philly.... that's flavor. The pizza?   Delicious sauce and lots of cheese.  Hey you can always go back to the robot produced food. Rocky's is made the way you really want your food to be made. Hot and fresh."}
{"text":"The toppings are very skimpy (24 inch supreme) and over priced for pizza That your getting not even getting toppings in every bite which is sad when your pizza alone is over $30 waste of time and money...  the cashier never have gave me a receipt and was super rude to me so I'm out my cash anyways incredibly disappointed with this \"eatery\" save your money people there are so many better places to eat pizza that do not want rip you off"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for Philly Cheese steak and pizza and wings and burgers and buffalo chicken fries. Everything I tasted was delicious.  We will be back.  The owners are Wonderful.  They came out to talk to us several times to make sure everything was as we expected.  I noticed they treated everyone the same.  Customer service is above normal standards here.  You don't get treated the same at bigger establishments."}
{"text":"We went in & had a Supreme pizza & the Rocky's original Cheesesteak. Both were Delicious!! Their Customer Service was also on point. Definitely recommend this place, I know we'll be back for sure!  We went again & had another Supreme pizza, just as good as the first one!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is TERRIBLE. I order a cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza. The crust has no taste. It seems like they added water into the sauce it was SUPER runny and tasteless. I don't know how they have high ratings,people must not have taste because this was tragic. Never ordering pizza here again. The only good thing I had was the honey hot wings that's the only reason I give it a star."}
{"text":"I have been here several times since I work nearby.  Their customer service and their food is excellent.  The owner (at least I think he was) knew me by name after the second time I went in there.  Their large pizza is cheap and good for the price, their cheesesteaks are awesome, and their garlic knots are bomb."}
{"text":"This location has historically struggled with different pizza places over the year and I've tried them all. Rocky's has been the best so far. It's been a big hit with the family and we look forward to ordering again!"}
{"text":"So this is no joke, this pizza place is probably the best pizza I've had in Arizona. Everything from the cheese to the dough is amazing. My boyfriend and I ordered a simple pepperoni and it blew us both away. We also got one of their fry plates and it up to the quality of the pizza. I am beyond content with everything ordered. A bonus is the staff is beyond friendly and helpful. I'll definitely be back because I think I have found my new pizza place. I just wished I lived closer :)"}
{"text":"I ordered there 5 cheese pizza tasty well worth the $13 i highly recommended it there normal pizza for $9 is good two"}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome. We will definitely be going back soon...  We just moved here from Rochester ny. I found my new favorite place"}
{"text":"This place is always busy but for good reason the wings and pizza are really good! Even the twisted crust taste like garlic bread on its own! You may have to wait but it's worth it! Also watch out for the XXL pizza. It's too big to fit in all cars in my opinion"}
{"text":"John is ammmmmmazzzzzingggggg!! Loved the service and the food. Glad we were in the mood for a cheesesteak :) Pizza was delicious also :) Found our new fave steak spot!!!"}
{"text":"Yo!!! Ya got to check out my \"New Cousin named Vinny\" and his Lady's Place... We Split the Provolone Philly steak sandwich for starters. Fantastic Job my Jersey City Friend.  I must say not only the best buffalo chicken pizza but the best Dang Chicken Pizza I ever had!!!! Hats off Guys. Worth stopping by next time you are traveling across the state like us or even around the corner... Cheers"}
{"text":"Great steak sandwich today.. Hot and tasty...  The bread is kinda 'dense' white bread, so I'd recommend a better roll.  The thing that drives me crazy is pricing.  $13 for a sandwich and fountain drink, no chips, no side is just too high.  Small location, nothing fancy, no real upgrades, (which is fine) so overhead has to be low..."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza tasted like stiff cardboard and for some reason the staff could not comprehend what half olives meant. To use the bathroom the staff had to unlock the kitchen door and then you walk through the back end of the kitchen to the staff bathroom. The bathroom was overflowing with trash and no paper towels to dry my hands. So, I wiped them on my jeans which must be what the staff had been doing too. We ate in the restaurant to make sure we'd get the wings fresh and crispy and they were luke warm and soggy. So disappointing. Way overpriced for a dirty dive pizza joint."}
{"text":"I would give this zero stars if I could because that's how terrible not only the food was but the service. I ordered a salad,which normally you would think would come with lettuce, but apparently not. So when I called to tell them that my salad I was told that some salads apparently don't come with a lot of lettuce. When I questioned why this was I was told it depends on who makes it. When I asked to speak to a manager a manager was too busy to even come to the phone to talk to me. Needless to say I did get a credit to my account but for the time being I had to make my own salad. When a salad cost as much as a whole pizza I expect to have some lettuce!"}
{"text":"This place blew me away...I'm finishing up now and the food is fantastic and portions are very generous.  It has an old school back east Pizza place kind of feel to it...Highly recommend trying this place"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place. And I'm glad we did.The pizza was tasty and the cheese steak was juicy and flavorful. It was a bit more than what we wanted to pay but, you get what you pay for. And they deliver, so there's that!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, and we weren't disappointed. We got a 16\" supreme pizza, and an order of garlic knots. The pizza was awesome, and just the right level of crispiness. The garlic knots were also very good. My only real gripe with the pizza was that the toppings all came sliding off pretty easily, which made for an unexpected mess. We'll definitely be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"First time getting delivery from this place. Order was late, they didn't offer me plates, napkins, forks, the Order took about an hour and a half. Never ordering from here again"}
{"text":"They need some help with customer service. I ordered a sandwich around 2pm. Was advised it would be about 20 minutes. I get there in 30 minutes and they hadn't even started to make it. The guy I ordered it from was too busy flirting with a customer. Then it took them another 10 minutes to make my sandwich and then until I checked it was sitting on the counter."}
{"text":"Great customer service. The pizza is so good that it makes it hard to try other things on the menu. My dad got 2 double cheeseburgers and they were way too big for him to eat both so I finished the other one off and it was fantastic. When I get a craving for pizza I come in and get a jumbo slice."}
{"text":"4/25/2018: I thought I had eaten the most delicious pizza locally. Today I had one of the best pizzas EVER. Toby, you hit it out of the ballpark with this one. A BBQ brisket pizza! SWEET JESUS!This is the best pizza Ive had...EVER!! And a big thanks to Vincent suggesting this pizza to us. I cant wait until we go back, I know what we are ordering!  5 months ago: Twice in one day? Are you kidding me?  This place is so delicious! The owners are adorable and have a goldmine here. The Philly Cheese steak is unbelievable the pizza is delicious and the sauce they use for the base of the pizza A+.  I just can't say enough. These people better never move anywhere else and stay here in Mesa. But if they do move I think it should be closer to our house in Gilbert, and to tell you the truth, I'd  travel a long distance to have this food. I know there are hundreds of pizza restaurants around, but this restaurant is among the top few better ones.  The atmosphere is casual and comfy and  the people are friendly here. If you eat in wear your stretchy pants! Just sayin'!"}
{"text":"Looking forward to trying this place for a while. Good news and bad news. Delicious Philly steak sandwich, if you're into Philly cheesesteaks you've found your place. Bad news, price. $19 total for cheesesteak ($11), fries ($4), soda $2+, plus tax. We're not talking elegant dining here, plain tables with plastic and paper. This is Mesa guys. Anyway, hope they do well and maybe come up with some combos before we make it back there."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and my order came 1/2 an hour late. The restaurant number was only answered once. Our supreme pizza was good, but the cheese was dry and cold, our cheesy bread sticks didn't have cheese, and the garlic knots just barely tasted like garlic."}
{"text":"Zero stars. Ordered pizza. Was supposed to receive in 45-60 minutes. I cancelled the order after 75 minutes because of a delivery driver issue. The worst thing is they didn't even contact me to let me know what was going on. First and last time I try to order from this place.  Dave"}
{"text":"The employee under a name of Vince did something that employee shouldn't be doing it's so disrespectful in many ways of him what he like 48 or 60 Idk and don't care he accused me of stealing something from the store and how reacted is stupid a immature he threw a coffee mug at me and the mug broke and almost hit the other paying customers as myself and the customer that he almost hit too ask for a refund and refuse to give it to and told them that there food is done so yeah rockys pizza is not safe if u know a guy name of Vince"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time.  I walked in and Vince and Toby (owner) introduced themselves.  Very friendly.  Love supporting small, local businesses.  Ordered 2 cheese steaks and they were yummy.  I ordered one son 10yo the Pepperoni Calzone and he loved it.  My 7yo who is very picky about his pizza really liked the Pepperoni Knock Out slice (huge!).  We will be back!"}
{"text":"\"I'm the asshole on 'Naked and Afraid' whose two things would be salt and chili flakes.\" ? Chrissy Teigen  It could be because I didn't eat all day but it smelled like Heaven when I walked in. It's a cozy little restaurant with *shudders* carpeting but this isn't fine dining. Order at the counter, pay, and sit down for some good eats!  We had a Rocky's Original Philly ($9.99) and a 16\" Supreme ($18.99). If you look at the counter, they have some coupons for you to use. We used the $2.00 off any specialty pizza deal. The car ride home was torture. Goodbye new car smell and hello carbohydrates! Once I parked my butt in front of the pizza, it was a parade of good flavor and lots of cheese. Toss on some chili flakes and yeah, I liked it! The cheesesteak was also delicious and I can't wait to go back for another. This place also had some fun oven-baked fries options like pizza fries and buffalo chicken fries.  All in all, I definitely want to come back to try some of their other options. With my love for pizza and cheese being so strong, I'm sure it'll be some time soon!"}
{"text":"Three stars is actually a good rating as I'm a pizza snob from Chicago. Good stuff.  Garlicky flavor.  Bit of a strange outside crust though. Vegetables seemed to be fresh.  And open late.  A huge plus!"}
{"text":"Try the cheese steak' s super good!  Service is nice as well.  Place looked clean.  Didn't have to wait long for food to come."}
