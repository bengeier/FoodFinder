{"text":"Excellent food fair priced large portions. Think its lunch only but so good.  Worth the time if youre hungry. Friendly staff. Food was hot also not warm very good on a cold day."}
{"text":"Wow - I can certainly understand why this establishment will be shutting down soon.  Quite simply, the food was cold, stale, and unappealing.  I stopped here in a hurry, but I really wished I would have reconsidered.  With the many options for food in and around Market Square, keep walking past this place."}
{"text":"Went for lunch - I think its all that they serve. 

Nothing more to say than - good food - decent price - and fast... 

Lunch with a drink was $8 and the portion was big.  Would compare the food to a Panda express with a little more of an authentic touch."}
