{"text":"I absoulutely love a good mexican meal, and I loved this place. I had the enchiladas and I was so impressed by the way it was presented to me! I was also VERY happy with the prices, and will definately go there again. The service was ok, but the food did it for me. I think I put on about 5 pounds, but don't even care... I'll go to the gym on friday.lol"}
{"text":"It's difficult to even write this review because it's a memory I would rather delete. This restaurant is an eyesore from the door and the food was just as tragic. On a positive note the warm chips and salsa gave me initial hope but that was quickly lost when the main food arrived. Frozen food quickly cooked has a distinct taste that I can easily replace at home. The bonus was being charged $.75 for extra ranch dressing. Nice 1000% mark-up there. Que Lamo?"}
{"text":"This is awful Mexican food. I've eaten here many times and I think the food has gotten worse. I will not be returning again."}
{"text":"AWFUL!!! My daughter & I arrived to a fairly empty place so we didn't expect horrible service. It was over 5 minutes before the hostess brought us water and told our server would be by shortly. Another 10 mins later and our waitress finally stops by our table AFTER taking drink orders for the new table who had just sat down. By this time we had been ready to order food for over 15 minutes. Instead of asking for our food order Sara asked for our drink order. She turned to walk away, I had to call her back and ask if we could order our food. She had an odd expression, still not sure what that was about. The new table got everything before us, mind you, we arrived 15 minutes before them. When our food arrived my tamale with verde sauce looked like red sauce, Sara said that their verde (green) sauce is the color red because of the sprinkle of tomatoes on top. Yeah, sure. But I was willing to try it before dismissing it. Totally hot, totally tasting like red sauce & nothing like any verde sauce that I have enjoyed for 40 years. Distinct spices detected that are in red sauce, not green-and SPICY HOT. She finally brings our drinks so I am able to speak to her about this red verde sauce. She asks if I would like some sour cream to cut the heat, and them tells me that unlike most restaurants, their sauces are opposite, red is mild and green is hot and that the tastes are even switched (WTF is screaming in my head). I'm starving so I scrape off the sauce and use the sour cream to diffuse the heat caused by sauce I couldn't get to. We don't see her for a while, by the time she stops by I have my wallet & card sitting out, half my plate remaining, sure sign of it's gross flavor. Had to ask for the check. Get the bill, she charged me $1.85 for the sour cream. I asked about it, she says that's how much it costs. Her tone pissed me off, so I reply that if she knew the red & verde sauce we opposite of most other places, why didn't she tell me and let me know? And then to charge me nearly $2 for the thing that cut the heat, sounds a bit crazy, especially given that I could have sent the damn thing back when my verde sauce came out the color red! Smart mouthed girl mutters as she's walking away, as if I'm deaf. Wish I hadn't left her a tip. I even left over 20%, that's my karma. Knew I'd write this review immediately, and probably call the manager. The entire experience was awful. Bad food, HORRIBLE SERVICE.  What a waste of my hard earned dollars. Seriously, Sara should be canned for a variety of reasons. Our first and last time eating there. Too bad, we love Mexican and live 2 blocks away. AVOID. AVOID. AVOID."}
{"text":"Margaritas are STRONG and AWESOME. Ambiance is kinda strange. We were the only people in the restaurant with a fuzzy tv hovering over us. Kinda boring. Some of the food is authentic and great, but some of it is not. Last time I went I got some jalape√±o popper-ish appetizer. I don't remember exactly what it was, but it seemed like it once lived in a freezer."}
{"text":"Whenever I go here all I can think is margarita, margarita, margarita lol I love  their special Sanchez sauce!  Their green chili is different then most, but I still enjoy it (which from my other reviews you can see I'm a hard critic).  Recently they started serving a hot and mild version of their salsa with chips when you arrive.  I love to mix the two!!! Service was great ... I can't tell you much about their rice, but I can say I will keep on going back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try a new restaurant and wanted to give this place a try.  I have to say I now understand why they only have a 3 star average.  It took a while to even be greeted when it wasn't very busy. The queso was runny and the main dish came out luke warm with an after taste of freezer burn.  I would not suggest this place."}
{"text":"We've stopped in for a beer and enjoyed a Mexican Pizza appetizer(ask for some salsa to spoon on to the pizza...excellent). The chips and salsa are very good and the service was excellent and friendly.  Never ate a meal but the place had a steady stream of traffic the times we were there."}
{"text":"Que Bueno=Que Barfo Seriously...who puts iceberg lettuce in nachos? They were so disgusting I will not be returning again ever. This is your typical greasey nasty Mexican Food. El Encanto is way better. Hands down."}
{"text":"Always excellent!  The best margaritas!!!  Love the Nachos Grande!! Staff are fantastic."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place prior to going here however, I can't. The customer service and environment are good but the food is dry and tasteless. I've eaten here 4 times thinking each time it might be better but, unfortunately it is not. My advice is to reduce the menu of stale frozen dishes and have fresh dishes even if it means having less items on the menu to choose from."}
{"text":"Great food and Margaritas. Always a must visit restaurant when in the area. Unless you are a huge fan of average refrieds and rice, order your tacos, enchiladas, etc Ala carte.  The margaritas are quite large and the service is average."}
{"text":"Took the family here tonight they have a full bar and outside seating which is nice although we sat inside.  As you walk in you cant help but notice the many salsa awards propped up in the corner for both hot and mild salsas.  Although Ive had better I would certainly say that theirs is the best restaurant salsa that Ive tasted in the valley.  My wife ordered the pablano pepper and said it was a little spicy because it came with the seeds in it but she liked it.  I had what they call the Accupplulo Chicken or something like that basically a Chicken Burro with Cream Cheez Sauce on it.  Presentation was fair taste was good.  Kids had the beef tacos they where good.  Service and Pricing was Good.  All in all certainly not bad but when your salsa is better than your food you get three stars.  They also serve  breakfast and the prices looked very reasonable for Fountain Hills so we will go back to see if its better than the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Mixing the hot salsa with the mild is the way to go. Just had tacos and rice with the chips and only cost 12 bucks with soda.   I've never heard of using mushroom soup for enchilada sauce. So I'm  pretty skeptical of that. But I'll give it a try. Just wish I could find green chile in this state.   Left satisfied."}
{"text":"The hot salsa is good but the service is hit or miss! My husband has insisted on coming here when we are in town but the food is basically mediocre. Not bad but not the best! There are better places in fountain hills that offer better scenery and better food for similar pricing!"}
{"text":"Awesome service. Bartender recommended something and I went with it and it delivered! Good margs and great service."}
{"text":"Had visited this place on a few occasions, over priced, a watered down version of authentic mexican cuisine.  I expected much better, and will not return."}
{"text":"Not bad for a local spot - service was good staff were friendly, beer was ICE cold, plenty of chips and salsa.  The salsa originally brought out was ehh, primarily canned tomatoes and a very few other things, no actual flavor or heat.  Fortunately, they have HOT salsa and it is hot - yay!  Pretty much instant nose run and combined with the starter salsa, in whatever proportion wanted or needed worked.  I ordered the #5 combo - a shredded beef taco and chili verde burrito.  The taco was excellent, the burrito so, so.  I have to say it was the smallest burrito I've ever seen, not only in length, but width as well.  The chili sauce was tasty, but the meat was extremely tough & chewy, could have used a lot a lot more time braising. My husband's chili relleno was good, not great and the rice & beans were okay, nothing a little salsa couldn't fix.  For the money the portions seemed to be on the small side, particularly for a Mexican restaurant.  All in all not a bad meal, we'd certainly return."}
{"text":"Great salsa and chips! The atmosphere is a bit bright in the restaurant area. I like the shredded beef nachos a lot. Good margaritas too. The guacamole was a bit salty the two times we ordered it though."}
{"text":"This wouldn't pass for Mexican food in the valley outside of Fountain Hills.  All I ordered were beans and rice and I'm surprised by how bad it was.    First, the portions were tiny for the price point, it was too salty, and when I asked for hot sauce the waitress started pouring tobasco sauce in a little plastic container.  Seriously?  I also asked the waitress if there was added oil in the beans to which she replied to, \"No\".  By the time I came back to my office the oil had dripped through the container and on to my legal pad."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. No more...  The pico de gallo used to win awards, but now it's bland. The guac is a version of the creamy goop you get in a bag from the super market... No thank you.  I'm a huge fan of pork flautas, but this came out as a gigantic thing that looked as if it were wrapped in some weird pastry batter. Didn't taste much better.  Looking for Mexican in Fountain Hills? Try something else."}
{"text":"We just moved to Fountain Hills from another part of Phoenix (we love Fountain Hills by the way) and wanted to try some Mexican food.  Living in AZ does have us spoiled and we really wanted to like this place, but it was terrible.  Other than the Margaretta (my wife said it was decent) and the Negro Modello (how can they screw up that) everything else was terrible.  This place may pass in other parts of the country but honestly we were not sure why it would even still be in business.  Salsa was bland, cheese and spinach dip watery, chicken chimi was soggy and had zero flavor.  My wife said her chicken salad was okay but very little shredded chicken.  We would have been much better off going to Sr. taco and getting take out.   Plus 25-30 bucks less expensive.  El Encanto is being remodeled and we ate at their other locations and it's pretty good, so we have some saving Graces to be able to eat out in FH at a good mexican place.  If not, scottsdale it is."}
{"text":"Getting 2 stars because the waitress was very nice. Food was horrid. If you post saying \"this is the best Mexican food I have ever had\" You're insane! Soupy queso dip, chunks of non melted cheese, got 2 orders of something called \"h-bombs\"...they made me throw f-bombs. I spent 33 bucks with tip for 2 appetizers and an Iced tea...YIKES!!! I will 100% not be back. The place was empty and I was told the \"owner\" made my food.   They called back to tell me I could come back in and they would make it right. Sorry, can't come back from this fail. Should have made a tuna melt at home and just got a beer at the bar. Oh well, lesson learned."}
{"text":"Visited this place from out of town and was pleasantly surprised.  The chips and salsa was great. Took some salsa home for a great price.  I had the shrimp terriyki with rice and it was delicious. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their lunch too.  Good food, the bathroom had one stall out of service and the place was a little run down. But the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Good, consistent food and fast service. Highlights on chips and salsa as well as Carne Asada. Yum.  Margaritas pretty good too. Guacomole was so,so..edible.  Have to mention we sat at the bar in the center. It was not crowded but very impressed the bartender handed us the remote without us even asking and helped us find the Cubs game. Nice!  If u r in Ftn Hills and looking for good food, great prices, and a lovely margarita, remember Que Bueno.  One of the few places that has remained open as long as we've been here!  We forget about it way too much."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Mexican restaurant hands down! We can walk here from the place we stay and I am giddy the entire walk there!  The waitresses and everyone in the restaurant are always so pleasant and happy to see us and make the entire experience so wonderful. It is a modest but cute little place with a couple TV and the obligatory Corona signs everywhere.  I always, always, ALWAYS get the grilled fish tacos, double rice - no beans, and a Cadillac margarita (or two) and it is the same great meal every time. I have also heard the chimichangas and Mexican pizza are amazing, but I always stick to the classic.  Please go here and try it out!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT FOOD.  EXCELLENT SERVICE. We were stranded as our truck was in for repairs next door at a SUPER repair shop: Kelleys. They suggested we wait at Que Bueno for lunch.  As we had our dog with us we thought it might be difficult for them to seat us.  They said no problem and so they opened their closed outside patio just for us.  We enjoyed our time there very much.  Monque our server was so sweet she even brought water for Bella.  I can't say enough about the service, their food and their hospitality.  These guys were great and Que Bueno (great name btw) is DEFINITELY the place for Mexican food in Fountain Hills!!! AND It is a super place to watch the fountain shoot up every hour."}
{"text":"Went to Que Bueno last night with my date.Chips and salsa were average at best.There was a bug on one of the chips.I understand these things can sometimes happen so we let it slide.She had a casadia and I had beef fajitas.The casadia looked like something a child made.The fajita was HORRIBLE! The \"beef\" was not flank steak but some low grade beef that was overcooked,rubbery,flavorless and grey in color.Refried beans were put on the sizzling plate and burned right to plate.Service was good and the place is pretty clean but the food is just awful!Will never go back"}
{"text":"Website states they are open until 10:00pm,  parking lot full of people and people eating in restaurant...... at 8:30 pm with light OPEN flashing  we try to go in and they shut off the light and lock the door knowing we just pulled in.   This is the 2nd time this place calls their own hours.   We try and support our local business and seems like this place could care less.    Funny thing is,  there are still families in Fountain Hills after the snow birds leave!   Way to appreciate the business that you have!  :-(."}
{"text":"We were in Fountain Hills for the day and we wanted Mexican food for lunch. I searched Google and found 3 or 4 spots. We chose Que Bueno because they had the best ratings. We were surprised the food was not very good at all. Seemed a little \"out of the box or out of a can\". The shredded beef in my taco was chewy, my refried beans seemed water down, the rice had no flavor, and my ice tea tasted very old. The chicken in the Fajitas had no flavor. The chips and salsa were the only two things I enjoyed. The staff is very friendly. Just not traditional mexican food. We were disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this Mexican place. Reasonable price. Not along the park but does have fountain views. Service good and food good. Try it you will like it."}
{"text":"We decided to have Mexican food at Que Bueno's before the \"trick or treat\" kids came to the house.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food. The server was friendly and really paid close attention to us, filling our drink and water glasses without having to ask. I had the Sanchez Special which was two enchiladas, one with chicken and the other with shredded beef covered with a cream of mushroom sauce. The enchildadas were packed full of meat and flavor. My wife had the taco and enchilada which were just as good. Not a bad place for good food, friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Prompt friendly service. Food was good and decently priced. I wouldn't say it was the best Mexican food ever, but it was good and filling. Our waitress was very friendly and patient  with the youngster."}
{"text":"Coming in on a Sunday evening and there only being 1 other person in the entire restaurant should have given me indication that this is not a good restaurant. A few things: the chips were rancid (literally...I could taste it), my son's cheese quesadilla tasted like they used bagged cheese and Mission tortillas (c'mon, I'm at a Mexican restaurant, you should be able to do better than I can at home), and the overall cleanliness of the place and service were lacking. I had the fajitas which were quite ok (which is why the 2 stars), but if there was more authenticity and homemade meal making done instead of what tasted like bagged chips, bagged cheese, canned beans, etc., I might be more impressed."}
{"text":"Who puts rice & beans ON the sizzling fajita griddle? Had to literally scrape off plate. Chicken was bland & not seasoned. Would much rather patronize Senor Taco, the little hole in the wall, down the street."}
{"text":"Refused to let me substitute black beans for rice even when I agreed to pay an up charge or pay a la cart. Absolutely absurd to tell guests what they can and can't put on a plate when ordering an item a la cart.  In this case, I was willing to PAY to have what I wanted given my special dietary concerns and they made an issue out of something that would have resolved itself. Some people just don't know how to get out of their own way. They lost a 20 year customer (and my entire family) over the cost of beans. Unfortunately the spirit of hospitality is not alive under Sanchez family ownership."}
{"text":"They weren't busy but service was slow.  We love their salsa, their shredded beef burrito enchilada style was great.  The seafood quesadilla had a good cheese sauce with shrimp and fake crab.  Looked unappetizing as tortilla was white...wasn't sure if it was grilled or just dried.  Still okay as the sauce was very good...would like to see that in a seafood stuffed poblano!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this Mexican restaurant and I was very impressed with my meal. The chicken and cheese quesadilla is a very good choice here. The restaurant itself is a little small but it's quite casual."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food with good prices and friendly service.  The chips are flour rather than corn, which is unique, and theyre superfresh. Nice and LONG happy hour(s) 2PM-6PM everyday."}
{"text":"The best tasting Mexican food in the town, that we have found. Traditional family style Mexican restaurant. The service is bad like most everyone says- as they are extremely slow. The waiters apologize frequently for how long it takes- so obviously the owners really need to hire more people. The place was full, only had 3 waiters and one busser for the whole place. The waiters are the hostesses as well- they tell you where to sit as they are holding trays and such trying to do a million things at once. The waiters had to make the drinks at the bar as well which makes it even busier for them. I honestly felt bad for the staff. If the owner would hire more staff this place could easily have 5 stars and more people enjoying it, more in and out."}
{"text":"Very solid Mexican restaurant.  Decent prices, good food, great margaritas."}
{"text":"This was such a terrible restaurant. We walked in and immediately didn't know where we were supposed to sit. When finally someone told us where to sit, we sat down and barely could see our menus. It was so dark in the restaurant.   The food was not very good. It was definitely over priced. We will not be going back.   The waitress was very, very nice. We had no problems with her."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Que Bueno several times, and the food has always been great! I would totally recommend the Sanchez Special, which is enchiladas in a special cream sauce, or the shrimp burrito, especially if you like some spice! The fajitas are good too and my dad practically scraped our bowl of spicy bean dip clean. The beer is served really cold, which is quite refreshing, and the margaritas have always been good as well. I am so confused by some of these negative reviews. They sound like nothing I have ever experienced at this restaurant. I would recommend Que Bueno to anyone looking for some good, authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"The cheese enchilada was pretty good. But the grounded beef taco was horrible! I think Taco Bell makes better grounded beef taco. I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"The service was kind and friendly, fairly efficient. The restaurant smelled slightly like sulfur. The bean and cheese burrito was less bean and more liquid brown and some cheese flakes. Tortillas tasted stale. The guacamole was just chilled avocado with cilantro, fairly bland. Chips were good though."}
{"text":"Visited these guys on my birthday last year. And while I think Que Bueno could be a good place to eat, right now it needs Robert Irvine (Restaurant Impossible) to come in and save it. The decor, lighting, ambience, service, and food are all average (or slightly below).   To be fair, there was nothing specific that we didn't like about the place...although, there was nothing specific we liked about it either. It's neither memorable nor terrible."}
