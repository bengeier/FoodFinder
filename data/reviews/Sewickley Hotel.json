{"text":"Too pricy for what you get. Uncomfortable seating Ann cluttered atmosphere. Just because you are in Sewickley doesn't give you Carte Blanche to over charge abd under deliver. No thanks."}
{"text":"The wait was ridiculous and the food was very mediocre. This used to be such an awesome place. The waiter actually lifted my burger bun with his thumb to check if there was cheese on the burger. Sayonara to you folks. Maybe the next owner will do better."}
{"text":"Good place for sitting outside.  Service is so-so, Kobe burgers ordered medium came super well done, fries were under-cooked.  I think they got it very backwards."}
{"text":"What a bummer. A great location, a great bar and ambience won't make up for terrible food."}
{"text":"The place seemed pretty quaint so we decided to check it out. Bad judgement.   We waited an hour for two sandwiches. The waiter stopped by zero times in that hour. Other parties around us received their food after long waits and left without eating, complaining that their food was cold.   When we got out food, the orders were wrong and the waiter spilled a cup of water on my lap. He did not apologize.   There are other options in the area and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Ordered linguine and meatballs. The pasta was cold amd the meatballs were dry and disgusting. Hard as a hockey puck and obviously not even close to fresh. Shame on them for serving such sub standard food. Only redeeming feature was that service was good. Though waitress charged me for dish even though I didn't eat any of it. Talked to the chef who acknowledged problem with my food but there is obviously something going on (bad owner?) that is affecting food quality. Other dishes at my table seemed ok (salmon, burger, salad) but nothing special. One star for back patio one star for server. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I don't know why I've come back to this place after so many bad experiences. I guess since its in a nice area I expect it to have great food and great service but both are hard to come by. Not only that, they really seem to have a problem with fruit flies. Over the summer I was constantly bothered by them and thought now that the season has changed it would have stopped, but the entire time I was eating my salad I was batting them away. The salad I ordered, a chicken fries salad had about 3 pieces of chicken on it. I need to remind myself to find another place to eat when I'm in Sewickley."}
{"text":"My least favorite place in Sewickley. Not sure why it is busy--I guess the outdoor area helps.   Inside always has a light vomit smell and the prices are 30 pct more than Sidelines and Pizza Roma--and not  nearly as good.  I gave two stars only because of the patio.  Drink outside, fine.  Dining, bring a budget and prepare to be underwhelmed--if not totally upset.   Service: we always seem to get 'it's my first day' waiter/waitress' and never sure on menu or specials.    Have given SH a few shots. No more."}
{"text":"Terrible - don't waste your time or money. If you think you want to eat here, just walk down Beaver and go to The Cafe instead. Much better food and service there.   Service at the \"Hotel\" was so slow (it was not busy - 3 servers only had 10 tables all together), 15 minutes to see a waitress and order drinks and another 45 minutes to get food. Food was lukewarm and not very good. Cheapest/greasiest bacon I've ever seen. 6oz steak was more like a 4oz steak. Ordered medium on said steak, but got very well done. Waitresses wear old, skintight Victoria Secret yoga pants (keeping it classy-ha!). And you get all this for only $35 for two people.   Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday night; had a reservation, so was seated right away.  Good draft list, I'll say that much.  Food was a bit overpriced for what you get; I had the NY strip with mashed potatoes and veggies.  The steak was not seasoned at all, and the veggies were a bit soggy.  for 33 dollars, it was no better than a chain steak house/American restaurant where the meal would have been 2/3 of that price.  Would go back for a happy hour/appetizers, but probably would not get dinner again."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday Brunch. Let's start with the fact that the atmosphere was more, \"dark smelly bar you were in Saturday night\" than \"nice Sunday brunch\"...the servers all sat around the bar looking bored and staring down the few people there.  The food was fine, that's the only positive.   We had a \"Dining Deal\" certificate from a friend and they wouldn't honor it. Gave us some crap about there being counterfeits - even though ours had a water mark and was not the same date as the supposed copies. They said the \"big boss would flip out\"...Of course, the \"big boss\" was not there!    I heard about another person who had one and the \"big boss\" loudly berated her in the middle of the place in front of friends.  So, basically, they sold the certificates and then won't accept them. Crappy service, no atmosphere and ripping people off as the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"Service was horrendous and food mediocre.  Used to be a great place to go for a special dinner.  What happened?"}
{"text":"Ordered a burger and a beer.   Sat there for 35+ minutes and the waitress never came back.  Never got my burger.   Finished my beer then noticed there was some kind of black sediment in the water I had been given.    If the water wasn't clean, I wasn't going to wait longer any longer to see what they would do to the burger.   After all, if it had been on the grill that long, there's no way I'd want to eat it anyway.   Nice ambiance, zero on the service.   Not sure about the sanitation."}
{"text":"A beautiful September Friday evening we arrived at seven elected to sit outside in the courtyard. Service was prompt but our lobster mac & cheese appetizer (14.95) Took 30 minutes to arrive. Although it was a large portion it had very little lobster taste and you can tell that it was sitting under the heat lamp for a while. We had to ask twice for our glass of wine. The wedge salad with steak was a half head of iceberg cut in half with all the toppings underneath! That was weird not much presentation. The blue cheese dressing hardly had any blue cheese in it and tasted very bland. I would rate the steak as fair. I ordered the linguine with crabmeat it wasn't bad it did not have very much crab taste as it seemed that the roasted red peppers overpowered everything. Iit came with 6 inches of garlic bread (22.95). I doubt that we will ever go back. Every time we have had dinner over the past 15 years  in this wonderful little community it was never  spectacular like the quaint atmosphere of Beaver street is."}
{"text":"Seafood penne sauce was bland, the pasta was chewy, and the scallops tasted very strange. Portion was good and the restaurant had a nice atmosphere but the meal was a bit disappointing especially given the price."}
{"text":"I'm constantly surprised by the low ratings for this restaurant. I've been eating there for years and have never had a bad meal. Whether it's sandwiches or a full meal everything is delicious. Service is professional, friendly, accommodating. The patio is lovely on a summer evening. The bar makes a good Manhattan and martini. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"A sub-par experience to say the least. With $24 entrees you would think they would serve their condiments in something other than plastic cups. Mundane waitresses with poor attitudes and a pork chop that tasted like fish. Way overpriced for the type of atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of the worse meals ever. My wife ordered a medium rare steak, it arrived well done, totally burned on one side and uncooked the other side.  My side dish included red potatoes that were undercooked.  The desserts were equally bad, they served melted ice cream to my wife and I got a huge slice of a tasteless chocolate cake, enough to feed three.  I suspect that even the homeless are not desperate enough to consume it."}
{"text":"I am real sad about how this place has deteriorated. We moved in the area 4 years ago and we were so happy to find a cool local place that had good food. About two years ago it began to get bad but we kept giving them more chances. Tonight was the final straw. We sat down, ordered our food and within 5 min, we had a swarm of Gnats and fruit flies surrounding us. We tried to ignore it but it just got worse. I will never go back. It's a shame, it could be a great place. If you can't keep the front of the house clean and bug free, I can't imagine what the kitchen must look like!"}
{"text":"Awwwwfull lunch experience will not be back. I ordered a burger with no pink. After a 25 minuette wait I received a very rare burger with blood coming out. Against my better judgment i sent it back. What a big mistake,  I got back a significant smaller burger that was my original with the bitten part trimmed away a nuked in a microwave. They didn't even take the time to toast a new bun or put new bacon on it. Smh I wish I could give less than one star."}
{"text":"Nice enough menu and nice atmosphere. But as far as lunch went I would have been better off elsewhere! Arrived at 11:30 only a couple people at the bar, we were the only diners. Ordered a sandwich as well as the friend I was with ordered a sandwich, we waited the better part of one hour to receive our food. The water tastes very funny that comes with ice. Couldn't drink it. Had juice instead. The piece of lettuce which was to go on the sandwich arrived completely adhered to the plate and wilted. The chicken was grilled but had a very sweet almost Caribbean Flavor to it which was not put in the description of the sandwich and did not go with the barbecue sauce served with it. My friends sandwich was a crab cake sandwich that looked more like crab salad that had been put on the grill to brown it - not good. So all in all I have to say I probably won't come back. I had heard many good things about this place and went on its Past reviews. But I see I'm not the only one that feels it has gone downhill a bit. It's a shame because it's a very key location and very nice atmosphere they just need to step up their food quality and especially they're serving cold and hot things. If they are prepping plates ahead of time they need to hold the lettuce until the sandwiches put on the plate and brought out otherwise the lettuce turns to cook spinach I don't think a lot of customers are going to want that. Last note, the server was friendly enough but he did not offer any explanation for why the sandwiches took the better part of an hour when no customers were there. A couple people were chatting at the bar with the barmaid but there was no explanation visible explanation for why the delay happened. It is not like we ordered a cooked entree. It was lunch. By the time we left at 1:30 there really was only one other set of diners."}
{"text":"We took the family to the Hotel for a cozy winter supper.  We have been enjoying their food and their no-frills, comfortable atmosphere for years.  We were all snuggled in and happily sated with some well made drinks when our Hotel Pate appetizer arrived.  It did not look like the usual.  It wasn't.  We have come to love the creamy, unctuous pate that the Hotel has always served.  Still, we expectantly tucked in.  The plate was adorned with yummy cornichon, pickled shallots and a variety of baby greens.  Sadly, this did not make up for the chopped liver that was supposed to be the\" Hotel\" Pate.  The waitress spoke with the kitchen who said that this was a common complaint of late.  They had switched purveyors and were considering switching back.  We hope they do!  As for the rest of the meal, here goes: The wait staff was good, not off the charts, but solid. The bartender was perfect.  Drinks were cold and not watered down. Highly recommend the gin martini. The food was just fine.  Fries were nothing to write about, and in this day and age, a bar type restaurant can live and die on fries. Veal was good.  Mashed potatoes, bland. Burgers cooked to perfection, but it's hard to get a bad burger in Pittsburgh. Price - well it's not inexpensive.   All in all, we do have a soft spot for this place.  You won't get a bad meal, and you'll have a comfortable experience, surrounded by the local gentry.  If you're in the area, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than one star, I would.  I have never in my life been so sick after eating in a restaurant.  I had the lobster macaroni and cheese appetizer. For my meal, Natalie's Burger. After taking a few bites of the burger, I noticed an odd flavor to find that the guacamole was brown. I was apologized to and it was taken off the bill. Yet I wasn't even able to make it home. The stomach pain was terrible. I'll spare the further gory details. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. Sat outside which was super cute. Our food took an hour to come out which was beyond ridiculous for burgers and salad. I also asked for my burger to be well done and it came out pretty pink. Then we couldn't find our waitress to pay for our meal. We went inside and no one would close our check. We had to wait for our waitress. Our food was mediocre but the service was just terrible. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"A lovely place for a summer lunch. The colorful umbrellas on the patio provide ample shade, even on the hottest days. Delicious sandwich and burger options. Large portions, good cocktails, seasons drinks, and friendly service. Free popcorn inside the restaurant if you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"We ate here on July 20, 2011. Not much to love here. The service was untrained - brought food and no utensils. The chicken I ordered was dry and tough. The burger we ordered was not cooked to specs given to waitstaff. That was blamed on a \"chef who is still in training.\" The hostess was far more interested in a large group of locals who came in after us. She bordered on rude to us. Not a good dining experience at all. The restaurant had been recommended to us by a desk clerk at our hotel."}
{"text":"This lovely place could be a real gem if there were competent, attentive servers.  It's a shame the owner doesn't take better notice of the inattentive wait staff."}
{"text":"Another miserable experience here. Not sure why we came back but won't again. Didn't see a server for 20 minutes. When we did, she was angry and arguing with management. And we had the pleasure of sitting downwind from someone smoking on the patio, which was questioned by the table next to us and the manager quite rudely offered no alternative. It's a shame to waste such a nice patio -- quite possibly the only thing this place has going for it."}
{"text":"Arrived around 9:30 pm and ordered a drink. It was made with the wrong mixer, but mistakes happen and it didn't bother me. The female server apologized and all was well. We ordered a second round of drinks, and the server returned with them and told us that they were doing last call. Not a problem. We said that would close out and finish our drinks. Paid and finished our conversation/drinks. We noticed that the staff was closing up, so as a male server passed, we let him know that we were on our way out. (We felt as if we were keeping them later than necessary) He loudly said \"you should have been gone already\" and then mumbled about how rude WE were. Are you kidding me?! We were unaware of the closing time and we were completely fine closing out when asked to. I guess we should have taken the hint that this particular server was a jerk when he was angrily closing up the patio umbrellas and stomping around on the patio right around the time they called last call. I understand that it was closing time and he wanted to go home, but he didn't have to make a scene.  If our female server was annoyed with us, she certainly didn't show it. It's called professionalism.  I've worked in the service industry for 12 years, full time, and I simply don't understand why the server felt he needed to lash out on two ladies in our early 30s. What a great first/last impression."}
{"text":"The quality has deteriorated at the hotel over the past year. Both service and food is not what it used to be. Have heard similar experiences from others. Avoiding it until things improve."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Had lunch here over the holiday. Always loved the fish sandwich. Food is good. But at the end of my meal a man that was very dirty and straggly looking came out of the kitchen and was talking to  the waitresses. This turned my stomach.... \"thinking euuuuu is this the person that  cooked my food\". I'll think twice before going back to eat  here again."}
{"text":"If I could give the Sewickley Hotel 0 stars, I would. Some staff is competent and friendly, most are not, especially the head bartender. She was cold and unfriendly, barely acknowledging us when we sat down. Ownership is incredibly pretentious, and overly so considering his restaurant is so poorly run. It's obvious he doesn't trust his staff to complete their jobs; everyone there seems very unhappy. I heard there was a new chef, and I was very excited because I had heard very good things about him, but it turns out he didn't stay very long. I think he went somewhere else, and I would love to know where because the food we had was terrible. The Bourbon chicken was dry, (how can a piece of chicken be dry when it's covered with SO much sauce?), and we waited forever for our appetizers. The linguini was so bland. It's a shame. I was really excited to try the new chef's food."}
{"text":"Service was good. That's it. Feels grimey and run down. If you're in Sewickley, I hope that you pick one of the many other options over this place. Patio is beautiful, location is great. Hope someone changes this place and soon."}
{"text":"I recently had lunch at the Swickley hotel just passed Monday and ordered the French onion soup and a Swickley hotel salad with Gilled Chicken and their house balsamic dressing. My partner also had the French onion soup and ordered another one of their house salads that was supposed to come with french fries and grilled salmon with their house dressing. We waited at least 20 man for the soup to be served which turned out to be the worst French onion soup I ever had. They must have used soft bread croutons which sucked all the broth and what was left in the bowl was a slurry of wet bread. When my salad finally came there was no chicken on it.  My partners salad did not have any fries on it with the salmon as advertise on the menu. Our server did bring out the thinnest piece of chicken I have ever seen and at six dollars for the up charge of the chicken it actually made me laugh especially when she brought out a small plate of greased soaked French fries.  I felt bad for our server who is brand-new in which the kitchen evidently let her down. I have had Many meals there before and they were very good so I don't know if there has been a change in the chef or in the overall kitchen staff I hope management makes improvements in the near future. And I almost forgot we split a piece of cheesecake for dessert which was not good."}
{"text":"More than disappointing. Poorly run from front to back. Food is mediocre at best but priced in the level of top notch restaurants."}
{"text":"Having hailed from the great state of California, I am programmed to measure a culinary experience by its aesthetic qualites as well as the sesame crust on the Ahi Tuna. This place had it all...a bar keep who was warm and welcoming....my waiter, Don Reylando, charming and attentive...a patio that was clean and inviting...and Fat Tire on draught to compliment my perfectly cooked rib eye steak and seasoned veggies.... The locale offered many an opportunity to view majestic oak trees (or Elm perhaps) while taking in the deliciously grilled protein delight that is few and far between... My companions were of all ages....young adults, children, and the wisest that Selwickley could offer...all dined in an air of life and beauty... Such was my short infinity at the Selwickley Hotel."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill! Our server didn't know the menu, got pissy when we asked why the plate did not contain the elements listed on the menu. The ingredients are no longer top of the line, most of the items appear to be from the local supermarket. Overpriced lackluster food with poor attention to detail or taste. Horrible service and the hostess was wearing what appeared to be just a shirt her outfit was that short. Not classy or upscale. Also the word spinach was misspelled on the specials board. AVOID THIS PLACE AND SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DIGNITY!!!! Last time I visited two years ago the foods were high quality and the servers could tell you about the menu not anymore..."}
{"text":"Went to the bar with a party of 6 people. Sat there for 8 mins with no one acknowledging any of us. Even thou the bar tender poured drinks in front of us 3 times. Had to walk out since we weren't getting served. Would not recommend this place at all. Was not busy at all !"}
{"text":"Great old-time atmosphere. Downtown for a pleasant stroll before or after dinner. World class service."}
{"text":"Service was quite slow...Food was a bit bland for my tastes, but, I'm I like New England Italian, which tends to be way too spicy for local palets. The dish I wanted, Wild Mushrooms Pasta, was not available, so I went with vegetable primavera....which, as I previously said, was bland. It's pretty pricey for bland food. I think you're paying to eat in Sewickley, not because it's a great restaurant with great food."}
{"text":"What the hell happened to this place? I've been coming here since before Nate. (That's serious inside baseball, but if you're familiar with the village you know.)  Someone has become too comfortable, during my visit I ordered a \"very, very, dry martini.\" It tasted like the wreck of the Exxon Valdez. Diesel and regret. Thank you, no."}
{"text":"The place wasn't very busy but we waited a long time and never got served. We even saw the table next to us get seated after and served before us. We eventually just walked out without ever getting to order a drink. Not a place I want to give my business."}
{"text":"Wow. Could be a great place, just isn't. I normally write  suggestions in hopes that management will read them and improve, but I am sure that won't happen here. The roots of problems seem to run very deep."}
{"text":"I had a burger, ordered it med rare it came med. I didn't send it back, the flavor was still good. Husband had a steak.  It was cooked correctly, just bland and lacked natural flavor.    The onions rings  and French fries were bla and tasted like they came from a generic freezer bag.    Service was  piss poor.  We actually had to go to the bar to order more wine and coffee for our selves    Loved the singer/guitarist   Probably not going back soon"}
{"text":"We went here to eat last Saturday after the farmers market to celebrate a birthday.  The service was awful.  Many excuses. The food was fair. But if you want a quick meal go elsewhere. Your going to wait a while. All we ordered; humus plate. Salads. And pizza. I had my 4 year old grandson with me. He was well behaved even though we were there for such a long time."}
{"text":"My husband and here came here for a relaxing lunch on a Monday afternoon. I asked the bartender if he could make me a Hot Toddy but he couldn't remember how to make it. Instead he gave me a double shot of bourbon and brought me a teapot of hot water, my choice of teas with a little plate with lemons and honey on it. Honestly I was a little embarrassed by making such a scene and apologized but he obviously wasn't bothered. I thought the effort was really nice and he only charged me for the bourbon.   Our food was also delicious, I had Ahi tuna and my husband had an Academy burger. We finished off with the chocolate tower and it did not disappoint!  Overall it was a very pleasant experience in a cozy place with friendly and accommodating service. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Very disappointed every time I eat here I never have a good experience today burger had an odd smell to it the chicken was rubbery and hard.  everyone was polite  they left dirty plates  sit on our table all the way until the dinner was served. I I stop here on occasion always hoping for the best because it's in Sewickley but never have a good experience does have nice atmosphere but that's about it"}
{"text":"Very overpriced and not offering much in the way of quality. Had a $5 cup of turkey & rice soup which had dried chunks of turkey meat. Ordered \"fresh cut fries\" which were obviously re-fried from an earlier time, when mentioned to the waitress, she offered to have a fresh batch fried. A Grey Goose martini at $12 way overpriced. This place had better days for sure. With the improvement in cuisine at many Pittsburgh establishments, this place with its service has definitely not kept up."}
{"text":"LOVE  The beautiful bar Delicious appetizers and sandwiches (my fish sandwich was dreamy) Cocktails tossed to perfection Warm, congenial atmosphere Free popcorn lightly sprayed with white truffle oil Ghost stories!  HATE  Tiny, old bathroom that needs updating Cramped dining area with diner-style booths that don't do the bar justice  Wow, the LOVE way outweighs the HATE. If only relationships could be this easy.."}
{"text":"Glad I decided not to let the reviews sway my choice to come here. I found it to be quite accommodating. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and specials.   After order an Original Hotel Burger with cheddar cheese and my friend ordered the Academy Burger ( I hate to admit he made the better decision of the two). We both ordered our burgers medium and they can out as expected with a strip of pink, not red line other reviews I read.  Again, everything was great, from the servers to the specials and food down to the cleanliness. Overall the only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is we sat down just before the lunch menu was ending but we could not order the lunch specials."}
{"text":"What I like about this bar is that it's a comfortable place to relax, talk and eat perfectly acceptable and tasty bar food. No rush here on a Wednesday evening, watching the baseball games with my husband. When we walked in (after traveling today from Chicago) at about 8:00 pm we were one of 4 couples. The TVs and music were on but the atmosphere was very relaxed. Not loud and not young.  We had giant gin martinis ($11 each) and  wedge salads, his had chicken added which was freshly cooked, warm and moist. What I also noticed was that this is a bar frequented by women and they wouldn't be there if it wasn't a good place to talk and relax and take a time out."}
{"text":"I'm currently at The Sewickley Hotel going on a one hour wait for our lunch order of sandwiches and salads.  The Harvestfest is occurring in town today and the restaurant was very unprepared.  Everything has required a wait and we've had to request water and silverware at least twice.  The waitress warned us they are busy (although the inside and patio are half empty now) and food was taking about a half hour.  The time has now been doubled and our table is quite irritated.  The waitress brought us chips and bread but we sat down 90 minutes ago.  Terrible lunch experience."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for several years and I won't be back from a number more. A couple of friends of ours met us here for dinner. They have a nice outside patio area and it was packed. We headed inside and it was empty. The lights were bright and the table felt sticky. I ask for them to turn the lights down, which they didn't.  I ordered the Cajun tuna with a lime tomato onion pepper salsa. The tuna wasn't bad but the salsa was more like chopped veggies then a salsa. It came with snap peas which were the highlight. The red potatoes were old grey and hard. My wife had the chicken Marsala. Good flavor and tender. The mushrooms were over cooked. Our friends had the prime rib and a filet. The prime rib was extremely fatty but good. Our other friend requested her steak medium. It came raw and was sent back. When it came back it was still raw. When pointed out our waitress stated she would have a new steak cooked.when our friend finally got her steak we had been done with our dinners for about 10 minutes. The steak was cooked perfect this time. For desert we all had pecan balls which would have been better if there would have been pecan pieces instead of crumbs. Our waitress was very good. She was attentive and helpful. She did comp the filet which was nice. Overall the food was mediocre, the atmosphere was sub par and our waitress was good."}
{"text":"Visited for the second time, with really no change from my first visit.  The inside is a little musty- the air feels and smells stale- if you have asthma you might find it tough to breathe in there.  The outside, where we sat the second time is very nice- tables with umbrellas in an alley with a fountain.  The service was ok- our waitress wasn't rude but not necessarily friendly.  We had the hummus which was inedible- the pita bread with it was very good but the hummus itself did not taste good at all.  Then we had some burgers and soup which were good- nothing spectacular and not worth the generally higher prices.  I wish the food was better as I live in the area but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the more memorable dining experiences of the year if only because it was dreadful from start to finish. Service was all but non existent. -- bits and pieces of meals arrived with no coordination, water not refilled or offered-- and both meals had to be sent back as they were cold and different  than described. The wine had an odd taste as if it were a few days old.  As for the Waygu Burger, it was bland, the cheese wasn't melted and the \"thick cut\" tomato  was hardly thick nor grilled as described.  As for it being made of \"Organic Waygu\" , I can not be certain but I am certain that the taste was non descript.  Oh, lest I forget, it took 40 minutes to bring  chicken fingers for my children and my wife's fish dish was delivered cold with the wrong topping and with rice dish that we are convinced was instant in nature ...  Although our waitress was cordial (and totally overworked), this restaurant is a classic example of mismanagement. Won't be returning anytime soon..."}
