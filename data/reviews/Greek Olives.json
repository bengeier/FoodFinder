{"text":"I'd return for dinner. I enjoyed their Persian meal & was thoroughly impressed. The venue is quiet & intimate with friendly staff.  Give it a try and as others mention, you will find it compares to the foods you'll find at the Danforth."}
{"text":"Best Greek food we've had in the city. 100% on par with Danforth spots like Astoria. Generous portions. Lovely service for take-out. Also has Persian dishes which were so very tasty - koobideh kebab, mmmm. Moussaka hit the spot. Stumbled upon this place after a major craving for Greek + Google search yielded their (non-functional) website."}
{"text":"We were curious about this place as it was empty most times, but something about my fanatasim for olives and it being in the name drew me to convince my signifficant other to try.   The portions were larger than normal and the meat was excellent tasting, the potatoes were good, rice good as well, not all stuck together or dry. I have a certain flavour I'm expecting when it comes to potatoes that Just Greek does more to my liking. Additionally I found their Saganaki to be, while healthy in portion size, a tad dry as it had not melted through.  However I cannot stress enough that the meat was excellent tasting, especially the Persian fare on the menu. Portions are perfect, prices are excellent too. If you're looking for a great large greek meal, you should definitely give them a shot."}
