{"text":"I've never had Bosnian food before.  I was invited to dine here by a friend.  This place did not disappoint,  we had the sausages with pita bread (onions and sour cream on the side). It was fantastic! We were told the bread is made fresh daily, it's light fluffy and delicious.  We had the Goulash it featured a lovely sauce and super tender meat served with rice.  Lastly we had the cabbage rolls, OMG so delicious. We shared the dishes family style which is what I would recommend to anyone coming here.  It's a simple venue where the scratch made food is the true star.  I can't wait to spread the word to my friends."}
{"text":"Tastes just like Mom used to make. If your mom is Bosnian of course! Luckily for me, my boyfriend's mom is, so I know how much this food stacks up. We had the Sarma (cabbage rolls), cevappi, and cheese pita. The folks running the place said they just took over a few weeks ago, so they didn't have a full menu, but we had plenty to fill us up! Also, they didn't have their card machine up so was cash only. I went to the Dollar Store next door and got cash back (be prepared for a $1.50 convenience fee if you do that). Overall, the food makes it totally worth stopping into this rundown plaza."}
{"text":"Its cash only!!! It's Bosnian food, similar to Turkish food. I tried cevapi it was really good. It looks like a family business."}
{"text":"Of all the places my coworkers could of taken me to for my birthday lunch, they took me here.  Nicholas my subordinate had decided that this was a great place.  My supervisor was not very sure herself.    The place looked very dated and not very cafe like.  It looked very shady.... but all went well. The service was very good, the staff was super friendly and did everything to please us.  They even gave me a chocolate egg with treasure inside for my birthday.  And they gave everyone else a banana chocolate treat.   At the time there were only two items available for order.  Everyone ordered this beef sausage pita thing and it came with a tasty red sauce.  And my supervisor ordered some stew that came with bread.  And Nicholas got us all the Coke in the glass bottles.  The food was not bad at all, very tasty and different indeed.    Overall a great experience....a little scary but a good place."}
