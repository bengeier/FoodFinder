{"text":"Hard to find unless you know where it is (mysterious sounding, I know).  Staff is friendly.  Large selection of alcoholic beverages.  Good food.  Good prices.  Stop by if you get the chance."}
{"text":"I don't usually review things unless they're really good or really bad, and I have to say the black bean burger tacos were PHENOMENAL. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars is because the wait time for being seated/food tends to be on the longer side, but it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burgers in Champaign-Urbana. They also have an excellent beer selection that varies from visit to visit. I no longer live in C-U, but when I lived there I was a regular at Farren's, and when back in town visiting recently, I made sure to stop in and eat at Farren's again. The burgers were just as good as I remembered.

I'm somewhat of a \"Burger Snob\" (if such a thing really exists) and have tried most of the popular burger places in Chicago, and I'd say Farren's ranks right up there with all of them."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town. I often get something off their specials but I love their Mediterranean Pasta salad (add steak!), the black bean burger, and any of their regular burgers. I enjoy the tacos but prefer to get the tacos when there is a special for them. If fish and chips is on the special menu I get that. With winter comes their chili which I can never get enough of. The chips with truffle salt are very tasty as are the fries (throw on some malt vinegar). I have rarely been disappointed here and if I ever am they fix the issues. The beer selection is always superb.

They are a small place but if you go after 1pm for lunch they tend to have plenty of open spots. Dinner is much harder to judge but usually a 15 minute wait is all you have to worry about."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in C-U thus far. Went on a Friday night in October with my sister. 

Had a burger that was covered in pulled pork, bacon, and cheese. AMAZING. (a heart attack waiting to happen, but so good!) My sister had a chicken pesto wrap thing that was also fresh and yummy. Great seasoned fries. Good bottled beer selection. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had a cheeseburger here, expecting the best burger in Champaign - and it was just okay.  I guess the meat was kind of dry.  Fries were good though, and they gave us soft drinks in the most massive cups ever.   The weirdest part of the experience was the bathrooms, down a decidedly sketchy corridor.  I'd probably try it again, but maybe order a salad next time - they looked really good at the table next to ours."}
{"text":"These are my absolute favorite burgers in town. The veggie burger is made in-house and is delicious. Definitely better than Destihl. 

One major downside is that the burgers come with tri-color corn chips. The house fries or chips are definitely worth ordering, but they do cost extra. The fries are shoe-string fries, so I really like them. 

The wait time can be a bit long, but if they're not super busy you can order take out. It doesn't take long and is totally worth it. Parking can be an issue if it's not the weekend but that's true of any location downtown."}
{"text":"The burgers are great - really big and juicy. They come with tortilla chips or you can pay extra for fries... I found the fries to be pretty bad though. Too skinny and not crispy so I was a little disappointed there weren't any good fries to complement the burger! But that's okay, the burger is really really yummy. I tried my friends' chips and they tasted a tiny bit stale but maybe that's the way they're supposed to be...?
I've also ordered takeout from here by calling ahead, the food was ready in just 10 minutes. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Best burger in town!!!  It is very casual and they have a nice menu selection, though I almost always get a burger. If you are looking for a place to chill out with a good brew and burger, this is a nice option. 

Prices are not too expensive, though a bit higher than Campus Town. 

Recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! Thick, meaty burgers (though you can get a blackbean burger if you're veg) served with \"tri-color tortilla chips.\" High quality beef burger, gently formed (I hate a hard/dense burger) on good buns. I always get the cheeseburger or bacon cheeseburger so I can't comment on their other more upscale dishes. I tried my husband's green chile cheesebuger- it was fine, but not as good as a traditional burger. The buffalo wings were decent, but not fantastic. They should be totally crispy and the sauce should be nothing but Frank's Red Hot, butter, and vinegar- these were just- meh. Have tried two desserts there-  a carrot cake and a lemon pie. The lemon pie was decent, the carrot cake so dense and dry it was inedible.

Bottom line: Fantastic burgers. Get a burger and a beer and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here..great atmosphere.  Only gives 4tops to 4 people unless dressed nice...so there is some unfairness there.  I even asked to be seated with my wife and they said no and then they seated a nicer dressed couple behind us there.  Also must be the only bar in IL that allows under 10yr olds at the bar...WAY ILLEGAL...food good though"}
{"text":"Great food. Cool atmosphere. Service was slow. Maybe caught them on an off-night, but we still felt ignored at our table."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burgers in Champaign/Urbana. The sides are also very good - ranging from old fashioned fried bar food to trendier options. Good beer selection. 

One warning: the place can get kind of cramped during the rush, so be prepared to wait. Worth waiting, though."}
{"text":"I love Farrens. Great burgers. The fries are ok. Service is usually decent. Price is a little high but I think it's worth it.   The appetizer of scallops are great!!"}
{"text":"Very Good food, cozy little place, kinda difficult to find. Not for folks in a hurry but worth it for those who wait"}
{"text":"Hidden gem of C-U. Free parking in parking garage next door.

Burgers, Beer, Fries. Top 5 burgers."}
{"text":"Just visited for the first time and we were very impressed with the food and prices. The buffalo wings were amazing-crunchy, juicy, and meaty! The house made bleu cheese we legit too! Our waiter was awesome and kept it real! He recommended The Russell burger which did not disappoint. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went there based on reviews, me and my boyfriend both ordered mushroom cheese burger and buffalo wings, the wings were completely uncooked and pink, and it was nothing like buffalo wings no spicy and nothing, when they brought our burgers the portion was big but no taste, it just tasted like meat and nothing else. My burger which I asked to be medium was completely pink, and smelled so bad. I asked to return it and bring a well done. When they brought another one it still was pink! After our lunch both of us felt really bad. And our stomachs felt sick!!! Definitely it was the last time that we chosen this place"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my first time at Farren's. My boyfriend was denied alcohol because he still had a vertical license even though he has been 21 for several months now. We've been to many bars and restaurants in Champaign and have never had that happen yet. Secondly, we did not understand the hype of the burgers.. I got the special, Mac Daddy burger, and it was bland. I had to add ketchup (to a burger that had mac n cheese and bacon) just to get it to have a taste. Fries seemed over-done. It took a long time to get our food too. 

I was really excited to try this place but we won't be going back. We should have left as soon as he was denied alcohol just because of a position of a license."}
{"text":"Best burger in Champaign hands down. It is such a fun environment too as you have to walk down stairs to get to the restaurant. If you are a vegetarian the veggie burger is a must try!"}
{"text":"Came here on a packed Saturday night with a group of 7 people. We were seated after a good 20-minute wait. Waiters and waitresses were welcoming and accommodating, but the service, after we ordered, was slow as molasses. Granted, it's a busy weekend night, but how long does it take to get an order of burger and fries cooked? It was probably an hour between us entering the door and getting our food. 

However, after my green chile cheeseburger came, the wait didn't seem so bad after all. It's hands-down the best burger place in town, and I'm surprised it took me this long to find it. The meat had plenty of juiciness and flavor, and the thick, but not overpowering bun soaked up a lot of the sauce. The secret to an enjoyable burger-eating experience? A good meat-to-bun-ratio and a manageable stack. If the stack keeps falling apart, you're not going to have a good time. Farren's makes a remarkably well-balanced burger, and that in itself gets this restaurant 4 stars. But tortilla chips come standard with the burger, instead of fries? What were they thinking?

Have a burger here with a smaller group of people on a less-crowded night (or for lunch). It's slightly on the pricey side but you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Elaine salad is so yummy i definitely recommend it.   You can't go wrong with a burger here.  Their beer selection is a little limited i think.   On a weekend night there's usually a line if you arrive after 6.  It's loud and a little crowded, so i find it easier to go with  just one other person.  But it's great that way."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Farren's! I always order the steak salad...every time! I have had many steak salad's at various different restaurants not only in Champaign, but all over the U.S. and nothing even comes close in comparison! This is one great steak salad! I could eat one every day if I could afford it. The service is always fast as well...even during their busy lunch rush! It's a bit on the pricey side, but well worth it!  The salad is loaded down with steak.  Sirloin, I think.  Grilled onions and mushroom, drizzled with a heafty ranch dressing.  Not watered down like some places.  Finally, it's topped with big chunks of blue cheese!  AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I feel like more people in Champaign should be talking about Farren's.  For those who don't know, it's a small restaurant in a space carved out next to the parking garage on Randolph behind Nitaya Thai.  It's in a basement, with no windows, a small bar, and a kitchen that is basically open (you generally walk out smelling like the place).  It's been around for awhile, but when I tell people it's one of my favorite restaurants, I typically get a lot of blank stares.

Some people do know about it though, because it is not uncommon to wait 15 minutes or so for a table (they do not take reservations).  The food is well... American.  They are known for their burgers (incredible), but they have great specials that change often.  I have had elk and rabbit sausage, venison burgers, and really good cuts of fish.  The house salad they usually serve as a side is one of the best around. 

They usually have 4 or so good beers on tap, and the place is very laid back.  Servers are not assigned tables, so you can just flag down anyone when you want a drink or need your check.  Admittedly,  I have had some slow service here, but I am not the type of person to get too upset about it.  The staff are typically on point and friendly, so I feel like that is how they should be judged.

Really great place overall.  I am surprised they have not moved to a larger location, but I am perfectly fine with them staying with what they have.  You owe yourself to give it a try."}
{"text":"I have ventured off of campus to Farren's 3 or 4 times and each one has been a great experience. As many have said, the burgers are all very good though a little expensive for a student's budget. For the student crowd, I would definitely stay away from the Kobe Burger as the extra cost isn't justified by any increase in flavor. The Buffalo Burger is one of the best burgers you can find in C-U and is definitely worth a try.

Outside of the Burgers, Farren's has many unexpected dishes which are all delicious. I have tasted both the scallops and toasted ravioli, both of which I was leery of at first, but each of the dishes proved to be delicious. Don't be misled by the word \"pub\" in the name of the restaurant, everything on the menu is a specialty.

The place is small so the service is always quick and the atmosphere is always very casual and friendly. All considered, a burger (or scallops) with a bottle of your favorite at Farren's is one of the best lunch picks in downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"Simply amazing burgers are the best reason to go to Farren's, and if that's all you want you will not be disappointed. But getting the specials has proven to be an even better bet for me. Farren's specials are often more exotic and provide me with a chance to try something new, but even when the special is something as simple as a turkey burger I've found myself licking the plate clean. Plus the beer selection is great and the servers have always been good and friendly when I've been there."}
{"text":"Though a bit off the beaten path, I was thoroughly impressed with Farren's:

1) The food was absolutely delicious.
2) The service was excellent, I never had to wonder where they were and the food arrived promptly.
3) Kobe beef burger? YES!"}
{"text":"occupying a small-ish basement location on Randolph St in downtown Champaign, Farren's has been my go-to place for salads for years and years.  they make their own salad dressings (both the strawberry vinaigrette and ranch are delish) and use excellent greens and toppings.  the everything-topped crackers that accompany the salads are light, and a real treat.  and their prices have stayed the same for years now (unreal, no?), which translates into a good deal in 2008.  

yes, they have good burgers and a mean veggie burger.  yes, they have creative specials using super-high-quality ingredients at prices more reasonable than all those other downtown joints.  yes, they were the original killer-beer-selection place before there was a Blind Pig.  and yes, the manager Todd is fantastic and the service is fast and friendly (don't sit at the bar unless you're up for a chat).  but mostly, just go to Farren's for the salads!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, hard to find, decent beer.  This is an excellent upscale pub food place that was a go-to in C-U.  Their burgers are what they are known for, and they're good, but when you're in the mood for something lighter and less greasy always check out their specials.  There's often a ton of really good stuff on it, though generally more expensive than their regular menu fare."}
{"text":"This is the place to go to get burgers! The place has such a personality, given the house chips and hole-in-the-wall-osity. I'm craving it already."}
{"text":"Farren's has by far the best burgers in town, but that said, they can come out overcooked. Fries are tasty too, but relatively standard fare. The beer selection is usually very good, but on a few occasions they've been out of several beers listed.

I finally ventured past the delicious burgers and tried the Elaine's Salad. I have to say I was disappointed.  I'm not usually one to order a salad--they seem overpriced at most restaurants. I've always attributed the high price to bigger-than-I-care-to-consume portions, but Farren's is appropriately sized, which was ok by me. The flavors, however, failed to live up to my expectations: the ranch was bland, eggs overcooked, and mixed greens heavy on the romaine. And somehow, besides a generous amount of blue cheese, it could hardly be tasted amidst the rest of the salad.

I'll keep going back--but I think I'll stick to the burgers."}
{"text":"Food is always top notch. The burger is by far the best on CU and probably one of the best I've ever had. The homemade chips are a must and are definitely worth the $2 extra on the bill and don't skip out on the hummus or craft brew. 

The only thing keeping me from 5 stars is the service. It can be pretty inconsistent and when it's bad, it's really bad."}
{"text":"The Russell, as always, was fantastic and the beer selection can't be beat in Champaign. While I think the wings are also very very good, the meat was a little bit dry but I do love the sauce and I love the blue cheese, as well. Farron's should be a destination for everyone in Central, IL."}
{"text":"Farren's is one of those hidden gems you don't find everyday. Its tucked back from where the majority of restaurants in CU are but its worth finding it. 

If its your first time time I defiantly recommend trying one of their Burgers. I switch between the Motherload and the Russell and instead of getting fries I get their house salad with house dressing. 

Im not sure what's better their burgers or salads.

They also have outstanding wings and beers!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best burger in the area. Large, hand-pattied, and well-seasoned! Tastes like a homemade grilled burger without all of the fuss. The accompaniments are fresh, and while some may find it odd that you need to request tomatoes or pickles I like that they don't get wasted if you are a plain jane burger eater like myself. Definitely pay the extra cash to switch from tortilla chips as your side to french fries. These are the skin on fries that you can douse with malt vinegar if the mood strikes. The feel of the restaurant is cozy, the beer prices are good. The service is very friendly and everyone seems happy to be there. This is definitely a regular in my restaurant rotation!"}
{"text":"I just recently discovered this Pub. It's a little hidden in downtown Champaign, but the food is well worth it. I ordered the Fire Burger, a very spicy burger with ghost pepper cheese and jalapenos. The burger patties are local and a very nice size. With the burger I also ordered fries. (extra $$). I would describe the atmosphere as a little more low end than some of the other pubs in the area. Think birthday dinner for your low-key friend rather than a congratulatory  dinner for a spouse or friend. 

I have also ordered take out once from this restaurant and had an amazing experience. I spoke to a man on the phone who took my order quickly and clearly. After asking for more ketchup when I picked the food up, he was extremely nice and conversed with me for a little bit. Highly recommend take out! Sadly, they don't deliver."}
{"text":"I was just visiting uiuc for the weekend and my friend suggested we check this place out. We went in around 12, and the wait was about an hour(including the wait to be seated) to get our food. The food was good, but not spectacular. The portions are pretty hefty. Definitely will fill you up. I got the Russell burger with fries. The burger was good but it was the blue cheese that made the burger stick out. The fries were pretty good. And my friend got the onion rings which were on point. Probably the best onion rings I've had at uiuc. For your money I think the place is great. I would come back at not peak hours."}
{"text":"BEST BURGERS IN C-U. I've tried a couple specials and they were good, but nothing compares to the burgers. They also have an amazing molten chocolatey dessert. And, I've always had excellent service. 

My only complaint is that they serve tortilla chips with their burgers; it just seems odd."}
{"text":"We love Farren's for it's off-the-beaten-path location and unexpectedly good food. You could say we're regulars. Enjoyed the chipotle shrimp taco special recently, but usually have one of their terrific burgers. My wife always gets the strawberry and walnut salad. It's delicious. Fortunately for me, she can never finish it. They have a good selection of beers and the service is always speedy and friendly."}
{"text":"Only fries in champaign i can have with my soy, gluten allergy. And they are amazeballs!  fresh cut potatoes fried in canola oil...yes please! I'm enjoying an order now . I always order to go tho because the place is underground, dark , with no windows...and the outside dining is located next to dumpsters :/"}
{"text":"They have the best burger in Champaign and their beer selection is surprisingly diverse. Order a bit rarer than you normally would as they seem to be a bit conservative in their definition of medium. Also their specialty fries are really good with a bit of malt vinegar so spring for them over the included tortilla chips. Be ready to wait for a table cause this place was crowded when I went on a Friday night."}
{"text":"SOLID burger. I got a daily special--burger topped with barbacoa, ghost pepper cheese, and cilantro ranch--and thoroughly enjoyed it. At $14, the price was perhaps a little high, but I'll definitely return. 

They must use a propane or gas to grill inside, though. There was a noticeable scent of gas throughout the dining room during our first and only experience here so far. Not sure if that was a one-time thing, but if it isn't they should definitely look into it."}
{"text":"Farrens can be an excellent.place to.get a.burger if they.could somehow teach their.cooks how.to.cook them to the correct.temp. I ordered it.Medium Rare. What showed up.was a burger much smaller than the.bun, an obvious clue it was over cooked.  It was a.dry juiceless burger.Well done for sure.  I repeatedly try this place but they.get.it right only.1 out if 3 times.  Service is.slow.and indifferent when owner isnt.around."}
{"text":"I Really liked the burgers and the truffled chips were awesome,HOWEVER...
We came in about 2 in the afternoon there are only two tables of people eating when we came to a sign that said please wait to be seated.
in front of it was a lady on her phone we stood there for about 10 minutes finally the lady on the phone she motions us pointing at a table to sit.
She  grabbed  some menus brought them the table sat them down and walked away.
Never said a word never put down her phone.

Apparently the phone conversation was more important than the customer.

The bartender took our orders filled our drinks while our waitress sat at the bar still on her phone.

Worst service ever.

The cook was very friendly and very informative as he answered my question about the chips.

My friend was paying and I told her not to leave a tip but she also works in the hospitality business and said it was bad karma.

I would not have left a dime I would have given you 5 stars because the food was really good but the waitress hostess slash Barstool weight left a bad impression on your business I think the bartender was her boyfriend because he didn't say anything to her"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the buzz was about.  They must have forgotten the flavor on my meal.  The burger was very plain and the fries were greasy and no good."}
{"text":"I waited a year and a half to go to Farrens, which was a huge mistake. The burgers are great, and probably the best ones in the CU area (though I still have lots to try). But what really sets the place head and shoulders above everyone are the potato chips with truffle salt. That stuff is fantastic, and totally worth every extra penny.

Beer selection is okay, and they rotate stuff throughout the year. Staff is also very nice. Farrens only gets four stars because the bar selection isn't the best and because the decor feels a bit run-down. Still an excellent place to go."}
{"text":"The burger I had at this joint was amazing.  I didn't love how small the seating area ended up being, but the food was well worth it.  Again though, as I was eating, waiters and waitresses, busboys, and more were brushing my chair as they walked by.   It was a terribly crowded feeling.  But the food was excellent, there's no doubting it."}
{"text":"First of all, the staff here are on their game. We went to Farren's on a Friday night for dinner, every table and bar stool were full and the line was out the door. Still, the staff (of just seven) got us seated and our meal out to us in about 20 minutes. 

I had a bacon burger, which was great, and my companions were happy with their choices too. They have an extensive beer and wine selection; so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great burgers but I go for the chicken tacos for lunch.

I've been going here for years, haven't had a bad meal and/or experience here yet."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that if you have not been here, and are going for the first time, get past the basment feel.  The food is SOOO good.  They have some typical bar-ish stuff, like the best burgers in town, and fried cauliflower, which I need to stop ordering.
But it is more then a pub.  Kobe Burgers!  Chicken and veal sausage specials!  Diver scallops some times!  Interesting and changing wine selections.  I hate beer, but I hear they have a great selection.  
I also really like the service.  They are accommodating, and you will wait for nothing.  That said, this is the snarkiest group of people I have ever seen, but in a VERY good way.  The leaving with a laugh way.  
I have never been one to not go out and eat alone if I feel like eating out alone.  This is my favorite.  If you bring a book, you wont end up reading a lot because you will end up laughing with your server / bar tender which will lead you in to a conversation with the people next to you, and you will enjoy it.
Go there now and have a good burger.  NOW!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger in town, especially with a side of bleu cheese sauce. Chips and fries are both made in house and are pretty good. Onion rings don't come close to the cost. Fish has been okay. I wish they had better bread for everything.

I can only go three stars for dumb things like the upcharge on fries, the grease-covered floors and spotty service. Some of the waitstaff are just jerks. \"Hey, can I have an extra bleu cheese sauce, please?\"

\"You already have one.\"

\"Yes. I would like another.\"

Giant eyeroll and 15 minutes to get it, despite the empty bar. 

They do suffer from some, \"Our reputation will cover my ass,\" I think. Nope...you still have to be polite, even if I want to buy enough sauce to bathe in. 

There are a lot of other places to eat in CU."}
{"text":"Favorite bar food in all of CU! Also, my favorite burgers. Anything with blue-cheese and/or bacon is a winner. 

It does have its quirks, though. The service is pretty impersonal, which I personally love because its fast and efficient, but people I've brought there have been turned off by it. Always pay extra for the fries--not sure why they cost extra but they're pretty tasty. Be prepared to wait on the weekends, but don't be terrified by the length of the line as tables turn over quick."}
{"text":"bring back dem chili cheese potato skins pls 

those things were t'd out for real"}
{"text":"Holy Burgers Batman!!!!!! 

I'm American, I love a good cheese burger.... but Farren's has taken this to the next level. 

You might lie to yourself and say you will only eat half. haha. Good luck with that. 

This is probably the best burger I have even had. And I don't say that lightly. 

You find yourself walking down a small driveway towards a little green building, inside is a narrow stairwell that you walk down. Now suddenly you are unsure you have found the right place, but as you round the corner there it is, packed full of people all waiting politely for even on a plate. The servers are running around and helping everyone at once. When you get a seat they bring you giant glasses of water and offer a bear menu along with your normal menu. Out server was super nice and very stylish to boot. 

I had a Motherload. And oh it was. I hit the jackpot. a juicy beef patty on a golden bun smothered in blue-cheese sauce, melted provolone and saluted mushrooms. 
One bit in and I think I blacked out because I don't remember the rest, just that I ate it all and unashamedly licked my fingers after. 

Do yourself a favor and plan to not eat dinner and eat lunch here."}
{"text":"This is the epitome of a hole in the wall restaurant with great food. My mom and I would come to this place at least once a week and every time, I was never disappointed. My go-to is the kobe burger with a side of blue cheese dressing for the fries. My mom doesn't eat red meat, so there were plenty of excellent options for her. Occasionally we would try items off of their specials and they, too, were amazing. The service is great, always friendly and very efficient. Farrens, to say the least, has become a home-away-from-home. Oh, and their beer options!-so good :) Anytime someone is looking for a great burger, I direct them here. Anytime someone is looking for a good beer, I direct them here. Anytime someone is looking for good food in general, you guessed right....I direct them here. This is the perfect place if you're with a group that have an eclectic taste. HOWEVER, expect to wait if you come with a big group on a friday or saturday night but you shouldn't wait too long. This is definitely a Champaign must!"}
{"text":"The sum-up: Pub food at it's finest.  

We're new to the area and have heard good things about Farren's.  My hubs and I had a free lunch w/o the kids and decided to go.  It was not hard to find and it was pleasantly crowded for lunch, which was a good sign.  We ordered sodas (bummer it was a lunch date, because we're beer drinkers) and each ordered mushroom swiss burgers, mine with blue cheese.  I also decided to splurge and get the fresh-made potato chips.  The staff was friendly and the food came out fast.  The burger was juicy and delicious and the chips...were (hold on...I'm drooling...) aaahhhh-mazing!  They were warm and the truffle salt was genius on these chips.  We will absolutely be back to Farren's and would bring the kids along.  This place is gold!"}
{"text":"Consistently the best burgers in town! Good beer selection and homemade sides. The 4/5 is due to size. I get that it's more controlled, but then causes longer waits or possibly eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"The burger and fries I had at this place were DELICIOUS! I ordered the Motherlode minus the mushrooms with grilled onions added and this burger did not disappoint. The blue cheese sauce they put on the burger was so rich and flavorful, the burger was juicy, and the bun was bread-y sweet goodness! The fries were seasoned very well, but a bit less substantial than I'd have liked (I prefer the medium-cut fries like Five Guys offers), but they give you a lot of them, so that kind of makes up for the thinness.

The service was good - the servers were very friendly and held conversation with us and kept checking on us while we waited on our food. The only reason I give this place 4/5 and not a perfect 5 is the food took a long time to come out, and when it came out, our buns were cold. This didn't really take away from the burger, but next time I order food, I'll make sure I'm not TOO hungry. Otherwise, I'll order an appetizer or salad prior to my meal so that I will be ok with the longer wait times."}
{"text":"The best place for a burger in Central Illinois, if you can find it. I highly recommend the Russell, with the peppers from the Fire burger. The place is almost always packed, with a line, so I generally take my food to go.  If you decide to eat in, the have a fairly solid beer selection to enjoy."}
{"text":"We love the homemade tacos and burgers and fries are always wonderful ..but it's it's just hard to get past the bad service in here... I've truly never had good service in here and I don't know where they get there servers they act like they don't want to be here. .I think it's poor business to have 2 servers running the whole floor and both taking care of you. .We always want more beer when we are there and never cam get one and don't be in a bit for a check because that still be at least Another 15 minutes.We watches tables all around us get so discussed with there wait time for checks and change and never saw a smile the entire evening. .2 girls working who really don't like there jobs ! But expected a nice tip which she kept the change off of a 20 on a 10.00 bill! Maybe with a smile I'd say no problem!!:)"}
{"text":"Best black bean burger in town by a long shot! If you get there right around 5 there's usually no wait, but if you go at prime time expect to wait 30-45 mins. Worth the line!"}
{"text":"Best Burgers in CU.  Everything else on their eclectic menus also pretty rocks the most.  That will be all."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Delicious beer. Just Delicious. We had the Fire Burger and The Russell Burger. Happy bellies!!!! Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for great ambience?  Look elsewhere.  This might well fit into the category of \"dives\" on the Food Networks \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives,\" and I say that with the utmost affection.  Nor can I vouch for much of the food on the menu, as I pretty much stick to the burgers.  Give me a Russell or a Motherlode with fries.  Delicious.  There is often the option of Texas Kobe beef or bison for the burger.  Both great.  Onion rings quite good, too.  (You can see the kind of diet I'm on when I come here.)  Decent beer selection.  In all my visits, I have never had any problems with service or the quality of food.  The staff has been friendly.  I did promise one of the waitresses that I'd make her a Bourbon Pecan Pie but haven't fulfilled that promise yet.  Perhaps next visit.  Anyway, in my often not so humble opinion (after all, I'm The Godfather), this is the best place for burgers in C-U."}
{"text":"The food and service was exceptional. I ordered a strawberry salad and it was phenomenal. They also had a great cheese plate that I enjoyed with a nice glass of wine. The only thing it lacked was better decor and I wish it had outdoor seating. However, I will still be returning."}
{"text":"Ate here early sep-12. Hadn't been in over a year. Why did I wait so long? Got the russell burger and it was delish. Got chips and salsa instead of fries. Very grateful to be able to do something other than fries. Our waitress was great and we were served by who I'm guessing is the owner (Mr Faren?). You can tell they are committed to having the best burgers in town."}
{"text":"I love going to Farren's for lunch.  I had somehow managed to forget about the place for a while, and when I went back it was better than I remembered.  I usually get the Steak Salad, which is excellent.

I'm writing this review specifically to point something else out, though: Farren's is an absolutely wonderful place to bring my 17-month-old daughter.  The waitress with the curly red hair (whose name I don't know, unfortunately) offered us fruit and oyster crackers for her as soon as we sat down.  Later, since there isn't a traditional \"kid's menu,\" she offered to make a cheese quesadilla, which I took her up on.  It might seem funny to take a kid to a bar, but it works out great for us.  We can have high-quality adult food and she is accommodated as well as (or, in my opinion better than) in any \"kid-friendly\" chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Update: I'm calling it. Farren's has the best burgers in C-U. The service is amazing, even when the lines are long and the place is packed. Definitely worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Love me some Farren's. Always considered one of the best luncheon spots in downtown Champaign. From the perfect hand cut fries to the over the top burgers."}
{"text":"The burgers here are pretty hearty and big- but this is not a burger review. I ordered the grilled steak salad and have also had the grilled chicken salad. Both were big portions and filling, but mediocre quality meat and produce. This type of joint is not meant for the salads though, so I feel like I can't give a fair review. Go for what they're known for- one of their burgers and some good ole fries and call it a day. No fru fru at this place."}
{"text":"When I travel I try to find unique dining experiences that I can't find at home. One of my clients recommended this place and I'm glad I came. While I miss my wife and wish she were here w me, I'm glad she didn't see me licking my fingers tonight. I ordered \"The Russell\" burger and was tantalized w the entire experience. It had sautéed mushrooms, pepperjack cheese and a blue cheese sauce that was finger licking good. Sorry Honey :( I added fresh house cut fries that were still sizzling when they were served. Professional staff. Kinda friendly. Cool environment and decent prices. I highly recommend this place. If there's one down side it's that I had to pay for parking. Bring quarters or park in the garage next door."}
{"text":"Got the Chipotle Bison burger. Cooked perfectly and one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. Freshly prepared even at 3pm (you can see the cooks make behind the bar)

Beers on tap are old world German and Czech and went well with the food. Some of the better beer I have had, and I'm not really a big beer drinker"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town! When students are gone you can get a seat inside.  We always get it to-go."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Simple menu and the food is excellent if you're looking for a good burger and fry."}
{"text":"Hands down- Farren's is awesome! I always order the Steak salad and my girlfriend has the Scallop salad. Both are huge and loaded down with meat. Service can be a little hectic, but great food at good prices.  Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Generally, I don't like burgers or blue cheese but The Russell is pretty awesome combination of the two. Specifically, the blue cheese sauce is really what makes the burger awesome; you can put the sauce on anything and it will taste great. Farrens is not easily located as the entrance is down an alley. I think it is probably an attempt to keep the campus kids out and create an environment that is more for the locals, which can be nice.

The place is small but our group of five was easily able to get a table on a Thursday night. The service was pretty decent, and it didn't take long to get our food. In my opinion, the tricolor chips were better than the house fries but I am probably in the minority on that one. Overall, I think it is worthwhile to come here and try a burger with the blue cheese sauce. Next time, I will have to try the Russell with the Kobe beef patty."}
{"text":"Food always tastes good. The staff here are friendly and welcoming.  I have never left unsatisfied. .  The chicken tacos are a favorite and reasonably priced for ten dollars for three.  The homemade salsa is delicious.  If you get the fresh cut fries ask for s side of vinegar. Farrens is one of the best restaurants in this area.  A true treasure indeed"}
{"text":"Whoa, mama, was that a delicious burger. My mouth still waters thinking about it...those jalepenos...that juicy meat...mmm... The crazy thing? I wasn't even hungry when I ate out with my friends, but I still finished everything, with the fries on the side. A bit on the pricey side, but totally worth it if you're on a casual date or your parents are celebrating your graduation. The service was prompt and friendly as well, albeit the waiter had a little bite to him. That's ok, he had spunk. Go to Farren's if you want a delicious burger done right, with personality."}
{"text":"Their Kobe burger with cheddar cheese, lettuce, pickles on the side, and hot fries are amazing. It satisfies the \"hard-core\" hunger..making my mouth water even now. The service is straight forward, rapid and no-questions asked cooperative.

They have at least two large TV's with sports and the food network on them, it's fun to watch as you dine in. Farren's Pub is a flight of stairs down from the street level, and filled with indoor lights and good aromas. 
They have hot tea for the non-drinker, and it's non smoking of course. Very cool place."}
{"text":"Burgers are awesome (and huge). Staff is always friendly. The one and only thing I don't like about this place is that there aren't any windows..."}
{"text":"How has this place been around for as long as it has and I NOT have tried it before today?!?! These burgers are absolutely AMAZING! We had three to try (bacon with american, mushroom with habanero and plain with provolone). All of them rocked! They were huge, fresh and juicy. We got fries with them and could not come close to finishing it all. The fries were really good too, not too greasy or salty. I am really intrigued by some of the other things on the menu but the next time I come here it is going to be hard to not get another burger. The guys working there were all super friendly and casual. Wonderful food, fantastic laid back service....this place is great!"}
{"text":"Very juicy burgers! Probably one of the best burger joints in the Champaign-Urbana area. 

Chill atmosphere, the decor was better than I expected after reading some others' reviews. It's good for family, friends gatherings and also to grab a beer and watch sports games."}
{"text":"I have been to Farren's about 10 times and I'd say their burgers are the most delicious in CU area. The quality of meat and how it's cooked is near perfect. The highlight is the blue cheese sauce in the Russel. For blue cheese lovers, it's that great especially with the sauteed mushroom. The fire burger with blue cheese sauce and ghost pepper cheese was one of the things to die for after the Russel. The service is usually quick and friendly even though the line is so long."}
{"text":"This is a great eatery that lived up to its reputation. Recommended by locals, it focuses on food, flavors, and an extensive menu. The ambiance is relaxed. Tonight's specials included a lamb burger and a hickory smoked brisket: deliciously prepared, paired with the right side orders. Priced right for what you're getting. Thank you. Will visit again"}
{"text":"Good food and relaxed atmosphere! This is a great place for high quality food and a nice time. Their burgers are huge and they give you tons of fries. You won't leave hungry. They have a small bar, but it's not exactly a sports bar kind of place. If you want large portions of great food go here. If you want dim lighting, few distractions, and nice seating go here."}
{"text":"Another reviewer says that to like this place, you have to \"get past the basement feel.\"  Good luck.  The suffix \"feel\" was a little generous, I thought.

Imagine yourself fumigating in the strong smell of cooking oil, garbage, perfume, and B.O. because that's what you'll get in this poorly ventilated basement.  

The decor here is what happens when you operate a business for years and stop really seeing what it looks like.  (At least that's the best excuse I can think of.)  Burnt-out lights.  Chipped paint on the walls.  A mysterious traffic light.  

The furniture was ordered out of a 1970s catalog probably titled: \"Crap Tables and Chairs: Dive Bars and Outdoor Taco Stands Our Specialty.\" Combine that with hopefully-arty-but-not-really-arty framed black and white photography, deep maroon paint and bathroom-grade tile flooring.  So it's more than a basement, it's a partially destroyed bathroom in a basement that's trying too hard.

Given all this, the $16 entrees on the specials menu were surprising.  One was a taco dish that appeared to be made with that pre-shredded cheese that comes in a bag and Old El Paso store-bought flour tortillas.  The catfish in the catfish sandwich special was good, but the bread was, in a word, unconscionable.  

I came back after a disastrous previous visit because someone told me the specials menu had the good food on it.  Not so.  On the previous visit I had watched them make the blue cheese burger by adding a scoop from a giant plastic tub of gluey industrial blue cheese salad dressing.  The specials menu continues this high standard.

To top it off, service was poor.  The food was delivered quickly but it was impossible to get a refill or the check even though the restaurant was half-empty.  Everyone seemed nice, but improbably busy with things that didn't involve customers.  The area behind the bar teemed with staff members who bustled around ignoring my waving arms.

I can only attribute the positive Yelp reviews to heavy drinking.  You have been warned."}
{"text":"Before I even ordered my food, I knew I would love it when The Cooking Channel was on one of the TV's at the bar. The green chile burger was quite delicious and went down nicely with a really tastey bottled rootbeer. My husband ordered The Russell, which I liked even more. I highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner, but don't expect a table at peak hours right away ...it's quite popular! The service was excellent, no fuss or finesse, and fast. There were no weird basement smells, nor did I feel like I was in a basement. It feels like a pub and burger place."}
{"text":"Me too, me too, me too on all the good things others say about this place and not me, not me, not me on all the negative things in other reviews.
We attended the film festival at the Virginia Theatre a block away and wanted to find good food near the festival and we got it right! We ate there three days in a row and my wife and I have only good things to say about the experience.
About the food -- the burgers are as good as any I have had. The one that comes with the blue cheese sauce is not to be missed - and do order one extra shot of the sauce. We just took the tortilla chips that come with the burgers (I did not want the calories that come with French fries). Bad choice. Next time I will take the calories and the fries. I also had the fish tacos (they actually  were called by the name of the fish which I forgot). They were great. Good quantity and quality. Served, as I recall, with a very tasty salad. The third item I had was a chicken curry on top of a bed of greens. Again, very good quantity and very tasty.
About the Service - It was lunch time. The place gets very busy. The staff hustles. They run thru the maze of tables. They get everything right and maintain a cool composure. They are friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. When I needed something I stood up, waved my arms, got the attention of someone (not our server) asked for what I needed and it got there FAST.
I don't give many five star reviews, but this place deserves it."}
{"text":"A true definition of \" a hole in the wall\". The burgers are very good and well prepared. There is usually a wait. 
They chargrill the burgers and finish them on a flattop, so you get the best of 2 worlds.  You can customize your burger with any available ingredients. 
Friendly staff but the service is slow, servers are not assigned tables rather they all pitch in and help. So now that you know that, plan accordingly, if you want a refill or something else just ask for it and don't be mad. 
We keep going back."}
{"text":"Im gonna sum this up quickly. Booooo!!!! Service/serve was ok, food WASNOT worth what they were charging (cold fries and hard ass bread on the philly cheese steak sandwich). AND I smell like a resturant! Ugh! Won't go back nor will I suggest anyone go there."}
{"text":"Great hamburgers!! The meat was delicious and I could taste how natural they were.  Also a big fan of the sautéed mushrooms and onions.
Staff was really nice and friendly.

The only thing we weren't a fan of were the fries. They lacked salt and crunchiness."}
{"text":"Got the Motherlode Burger with fresh cut fries.  Very good. Place was packed. Restaurant could use some clean up. Walls had splashes of food on them."}
{"text":"As good as advertised. Burger was great, and the service was friendly. We were fortunate enough to go when it wasn't crowded, but the space is rather small, so peak hours will likely have a wait."}
{"text":"Great food, average service, poor atmosphere. The place is cramped and they are understaffed. Our order was slow to come out (both drinks and food), had a few errors, and they left the paper on the slice of cheese. Because of this- I wouldn't recommend taking your date here, go with friends for a delicious burger."}
{"text":"Hell to the mothereffin' Yes.

Farren's has a delicious, mouthwatering burger that puts others to shame.  If you don't like a Farren's burger, stand up, slap yourself in the face, and try again.  It's that good.  Unless you're a vegetarian, or kosher or Hindu.  Then you can refrain from the slapping, and just glare in frustration.

The beer selection is great, and if you just wanna watch a game, drink a beer, and enjoy a delicious, delicious burger, go to freakin' Farren's.  My burger of choice when i want to obliterate all healthiness is the \"Motherlode\"---mushrooms, cheese, and bleu cheese--it tastes like heart attacks and love.

Farren's also shares this bizarre joint bathroom with two other great restaurants, Sushi Kame and Nitaya Thai, which makes for an amusing dining experience to say the least as you walk the labyrinthine corridors like Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom, simply looking for a place to pee."}
{"text":"I love Farren's burgers. I usually get The Russell burger and order it with bison instead of beef (sometimes they run out of the bison). Of course if you don't like mushroom, then it's not for you. I usually also go with the handcut fries, but some people love their truffle chips. I find them to be too salty. They also have good salads, if you want some lighter fare."}
{"text":"These burgers are ridiculous. One of my boys hit me up and was like we need to go to Farren's. One of the best burgers I've ever had in my life and easily the best burger in the Champaign area. No one else comes close."}
{"text":"Farrens has stepped it up. I haven't been denied a carry out in a long time."}
{"text":"What's not to love? Their burgers are big and delicious, and the sweet potato fries are a nice departure from boring regular fries. When you just need some red meat, come here for a yummy burger!"}
{"text":"The burgers are indeed quite good!  We had a green chile cheese burger and a mushroom Swiss cheese burger.   The Saturday night wait is a little tough, but 20 minutes later, we were seated.  Lots to choose from on the menu.. burgers, sandwiches, salads. Most importantly, the fries are excellent, and the onion rings are very good  the coating is light and stays with the onion ring when you bite into it!"}
{"text":"I liked this place.  Yes it is hidden awa...but that just adds to the charm of the place.  It's nothing fancy, just a nice burger joint.  The burger was good...was it the best I have ever eaten...not really...but they are good.  I loved the fries.  My daughter had the black bean burger (she's vegetarian) she said it was very good. All in all a very tasty meal."}
{"text":"Had the fire burger medium rare at lunch today with fries. Off-the-charts! Not to spicy for me, and i could have doubled the peppers. I think I need to return and have the Russell. 

Before 11:45 this place had a line at the door to be seated. It is not a huge place, but we'll worth any wait."}
{"text":"I've lived in Champaign for the past few years, but I may as well have been living under a rock since I hadn't ever tried Farren's. I mean, WOW, this place is good! I'm always a bit skeptical of places that are really hyped up by people as they can sometime fall short of expectations, but that's not the case with Farren's. 
It's not a big or fancy place, it's kind of a hole in the wall in all honesty but that's what I like best about it. We sat at the bar and were immediately welcomed by their staff. In fact, throughout the night multiple staff checked in on us, not just our primary server. 
They have quite the beer selection (mostly bottles/cans) and have a full bar as well. We got the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer (fantastic) and I got The Spicoli burger, which has onions, mushrooms, cheese, and bacon. It was such a good burger. It had the perfect charbroiled taste and was perhaps the best burger I've had in C-U.
Farren's definitely lived up to the hype. Simply put, it's a great place to eat. No frills, but great food. I'll make sure to be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  Thanks to Yelp, I found it!  Nice little bar type atmosphere with seating.  Open kitchen, so you ca watch them cook your burger!

I would definitely recommend the \"special\" burger of the day.  Ours was Elk, and it was fantastic!  Also, many great beers on tap."}
{"text":"Super amazing burgers!! I had the regular with blue cheese sauce!!! It was delicious!! Definitely going again!!!"}
{"text":"Very good beef and salmon burgers.  Fresh food, good service.  Not loaded with smelly college kids either!  A great find.  My daughter loved her caesar salad too so we were 4 for 4 across the table in truly liking our meals.  Fresh brewed iced tea always nice."}
{"text":"Great burgers!!! I went there was some friends and was very surprised at how good the food was. I love the atmosphere because it is definitely a place that has a pub setting. Definitely a place to try and go again and again!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!!!!  We had a little bit of a wait but it was worth it.... quite honestly might be the best burger I've ever had....it was busy and the staff was hustling! 
We also had hummus which was delicious... I opted for onion rings with my burger, they were my least favorite thing but they weren't bad....the other stuff was just excellent!"}
{"text":"Kobe burgers, truffle french fries, glasses of soda (or pop, whatever) the size of your head.  I love Farren's so much, but I often forget about it due to it's out of the way location.  However, anytime I feel even remotely like celebrating something, it's always Farren's I go to.  Also, sometimes I crave their house dressing in an unhealthy way.   Only downsides is that the place is small and can get really busy on weeknights or game days.  When it gets busy, service can sometimes slow down."}
{"text":"Here's hoping my brother doesn't disown me for this review. He swears by this place. 

The entrance is through an alley. You could miss it if you're not paying attention. This would have stayed a \"local gem\" had it not been mentioned in a few articles touting its burgers. We usually order takeout. Lucky for us, this time around we beat the dinner rush, and were able to dine inside. Yes, the burgers are quite delectable. I do appreciate the fact that you are able to flag any of the servers to help you. Once the dinner rush hit, I must admit it was unsettling to have onlookers waiting to be seated gawk at those already seated, as if to visually urge them out the door. Personally, I'd stick to takeout, service can lag once the place is busy, and you don't have onlookers drooling over your food."}
{"text":"The food here is always top notch!  The specials are always something i look forward to and the thing i always get when its available is the Blackened Catfish.  Its just as good as anything i've had in New Orleans."}
{"text":"It's a neighborhood pub, and they definitely embrace that title when it comes to the menu. Burgers, fries, more fried things; all the usual suspects are available with your drink here. Not that that makes them plain, by any stretch. But just understand, that's their focus and what they do best.

It was good, too, to see that they mix things up with specials. Although I didn't have it, I did see a Cuban sandwich arrive at our table, and that's not something that's seen too often around town. Thumbs up to them for trying new things.

Snappy service late one Friday night. Plenty of drinks, and my soft drink got refilled post haste. It's not all ooey gooey warm, but I got about zero attitude, and food came out pretty quick.

It's not much for ambiance, except it nails the neighborhood pub ambiance. The bar. The one, simple dining room. You get in, you get a drink, you get a burger, you catch up with your friends, and you've had the Farren's experience."}
{"text":"I'm just gonna say it: the best burgers in town. It's a super cozy location with service that is always quick and friendly, and with plenty of beer options. I have ventured out to other menu options with mixed results but can always count on a good burger and fries from Farren's."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time to this place in about 2 years time. The siblings and I came here to visit after they arrived in town. 

I didn't eat anything tonight as I'd eaten earlier. They all had fabulous food. I shot photos of most all the food. There was two salads a black bean veggie burger and a mother load burger. There was fresh cut fries and chips. Everybody loved the food, the atmosphere, and drinks.

Great time."}
{"text":"Just like all other reviews, I had the Kobe burger and it was absolutely delicious. I love the open atmosphere. We've never had to wait in the two times we've been there, however I have noticed both times it seems to be FREEZING in the restaurant. Its slightly pricey, but the food is well worth it. And the fries. The FRIES! They come without salt but the salt on the table is flakey instead of crystals, which really does make a difference. And it's a wonderful difference."}
{"text":"Farrens may not have the fanciest atmosphere, but the burgers are great! In particular,  their burger specials (kobo beef or bison burger) are great! The fries are made from real potatoes, the service is very kind. I usually hardly ever finish a whole dish at farrens, it's abundant and really tasty. You can tell that they use high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I love the food, and in my opinion it's the best in champaign/Urbana. Everything from the chicken tacos to the burgers to the specials of the day, you can't choose wrong. I would give it 5 stars but more often than that I get so-so service. They get busy and i understand that but sometimes too slow."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat out in CU.

As an alumni of UIUC, I find this place to be fairly priced with decent service. They have a solid draft selection as well as a well-rounded menu.

Food: 5/5 (Remember, if you're not a chip-person, you can always change it out for fries for few cents! The Spicoli is the first-timer's go-to. However, I personally like it a little hot. You'll see what I mean when you get there. Their *real* [emphasis on that] Ginger Ale is real. Seriously. Burns like a mother, but still good.)

Price: A full meal with a draft and tip will be ~$10-15 per person, assuming that you get a burger. I'm not quite sure about the appetizers. But, it's definitely not a bad price.

Mood: A little dark. Has more of a darker, but cheerful, environment compared to other bars.

Service: I found the service to be good. No remarkable situations or anything necessarily outstanding compared to your expected service for restaurant in this tier.

Other comments: Definitely recommended to visit at least once. If you and couple of your buddies want some decent burgers, this is one of the places to go. Might as well pay here, then go to Five-Guys to waste your money or any other corporate burger shops."}
{"text":"The food is great but the services is terrible. You won't get checked on very often. So don't expect refills or fast services. You will be waiting in line for a table for a while also."}
{"text":"Everything was exceptional!! Walk in there was a line of people waiting, but the wait was probably 5 mins. Service was great and the food is just awesome, ddefinitely a return visit for their burgers and fries"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. When my friends and I arrived, the restaurant was not busy at all (about six other occupied tables); the wait to get a table, to get our order in, and get our checks was way too long and I just did not comprehend how their service quality.
I have held four other waitressing or food service jobs, so I am usually understandable if the place was busy and the restaurant is understaffed, but this was just unacceptable. The burger was mediocre, and I believe that most places cook their burgers medium. The burger here seemed it was cooked super medium well and the bacon was overcooked as well; it was very hard to chew."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, the food was typical American Pub grub. Nothing really stood out as exceptional, but this is a popular place for friends to eat and hang out."}
{"text":"The hostess is terribly RUDE and nasty. The seating is horrible. Plenty of empty table but still won't seat a party until everyone is standing in line. The last time I was there the food was good but really slow. Our party left without being served. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I really don't get what the big deal is with this place.  I have had friends tell me thats they have some of the best burgers out there, but when i went there they were nothing special.  The place as a whole is just average: the setting, the service and the food.  This place is over rated."}
{"text":"\"Best burgers in Champaign\" might be true, but also \"You will wait 30 minutes to get a glass of water.\" 

Came in on a Sunday and it was pretty busy, since there was a Garth Brooks concert going on and dinner rush. No biggie, I understand. My friend and I were seated almost immediately, right in front of the door to the kitchen. You'd think that would make the servers notice us, right? Wrong. 

Server #1 hands us the menu, and asks what we want to drink. \"Water's fine.\" She goes off to serve over tables and we never received our waters. My friend had to flag down another server just to get water and put our orders in, or else we'd be sitting there all night. I don't get it, with 2 people sitting there in front of a busy entrance you'd think someone would at least ask us *something*.

We got fried cauliflower as an appetizer. Meh overpriced for 5 actual florets. It took 45 minutes for our food to come out. Granted it was busy, but I noticed the strangest thing: people who came in after us had their orders, food, and paid before we even got our own food. It wasn't like they preordered it -- other customers were handed a menu and everything. At this point I was pretty hangry. 

Burger was alright. I got the mushroom cheeseburger. Don't forget to ask for lettuce, tomato and pickle -- you have to ask for it. Fries are extra.  

TLDR: food alright, service was crappy for no reason."}
{"text":"It is small but mighty! Our family of four ventured out and took a recommendation from others. We had the best mozzarella cheese sticks for an appetizer with three burgers (different options) and the Santa Fe Chicken sandwich. We tasted several different ciders: Stiegl Grapefruit Radler, Black Widow, and Crispin. The homemade fries were awesome with malt vinegar and ketchup. The wait staff was a bit slow but all tables were full. Overall,  bill was $80 and none of us left hungry or thirsty."}
{"text":"Thank you, Carolyn F., for setting the record straight -- I stand corrected.  My friend is coming back to town in a couple of weeks and I promise we will stop in again for another try of your fries.  Just don't get me addicted to them like I have Jarling's Custard....whoo boy ;)"}
{"text":"Seriously. Best burgers in town. The black burger is BOMB! Without that cajun remoulade, it's delicious, but with it, FREAKIN' FANTASTIC! The fresh house made potato chips are like crack with the black truffle sea salt they use. My heart was almost broken when they were sold out of chips, but the server (also the owner) said they could add the crack...erm... salt.. to the house cut fries. Wasn't quite the same, but it was still very tasty. Service isn't always super friendly, but I don't care when I get the best burger and chips in town. The burgers aren't the only good part. They have daily specials that have always been satisfying and unique. They also have some stellar dark beers. Wait time can be a little long depending on when you come, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"The Russel burger was the best. I would definitely visit this spot again. Along with recommend it to anyone in the aera looking for a great burger."}
{"text":"Greatest burger around. Super atmosphere.  We were able to sample a beer before ordering. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Farren's has the best burgers in town! The Russell is my fav, but everything there is really good. I order WITHOUT raw onions on the plate.. they are super potent!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much upon entry I was congratulated for finding the place. It is set back and between a parking garage and some other building, but it is painted bright green... I think that is what helped me! This place is super casual. The tables and chairs are not very aesthetically pleasing, but i guess it gets the job done. 

I ordered the grilled scallop salad (because when the guy next to me ordered it and I decided immediately that is what I wanted as well). I am so glad I copied him. This salad was sooo good. Mixed greens. Sweet fruity dressing, Tasty scallops. Walnuts. Strawberries. Grapes. I also think that most salads like this use either feta or goat cheese, but this salad had Parmesan cheese which I think was perfect because the other cheeses I find to be too overwhelming sometimes. Also make sure you get the crackers that come with the salad! 

Apparently, their burgers are good too.... Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Wildly overrated.  Everybody says that it has the best burgers in town, and the place suffers a little from excessively high expectations. I've only had the burgers, so I can't speak to anything else.  In brief, the burgers are bland, just plain patted beef patties on a griddle. There is nothing exceptional in the seasoning, preparation, quality of beef, toppings, etc. It's nothing special, neither good nor bad.  The dingy atmosphere (a staid lunch counter in a basement that had leaking ceilings both times I went) might be considered cool in a kitschy or hipster way, but I found it unappealing.  If you want the crappy ambience to be a selling point, then the food has to be good.  I tried it twice, it underwhelmed on both occasions.  Maybe I'm missing something..."}
{"text":"Returned at suggestion of in-laws.  This time got sat, but service still leaves some to desire.  Mostly empty, but 10 minutes until we were sat.  Maybe they are understaffed.  Burger was great, fries were good and serving size was large.  The blue cheese tasted like ranch.  Hate Blue cheese, like the sauce.  Price was also steep for bar fare, Burger was $11.50 with fries, dinner entries and salads were $12-15.  Similar Burger and fries at Murphys would be half that price.

4 stars for food
3 stars for value
2 stars for service"}
{"text":"Farren's is the DEFINITION of a hole in the wall restaurant in Champaign. Note: Your whole party has to be present in order to be seated. You cannot say, \"Oh, they're coming in 5 minutes\". This is due to their limited space.

I came with a group of 6 and we had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. Everyone got their food in about 15 minutes. I ordered the Veggie Burger and the homemade chips. I ate everything on my plate. They make the veggie burger taste like a real burger somehow; it's the way they cook it. 

The price is a little steep compared to other burger places. I believe that it is worth it. The noise level is higher than average because it is such a small place. Don't let that stop you. Go to Farren's! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, very local small town feeling in there. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because the lighting is awkward and the room doesn't feel cozy at all, kinda cafeteria-like."}
{"text":"Best Burger in Champaign Hands Down! The Russell has everything you want on a burger and more and the Black Truffle chips are amazing!"}
{"text":"I'd been running errands all day and then had to work at State Farm Center. I left work and was starving and I wanted a real burger not that disgusting fast food crap. I made my way to Farren's. I had been here once before. I was seated quickly. When the server came I ordered a glass of water but mentioned I wanted a cup of coffee. The server said they didn't have any made but they were willing to make it. I said no, don't make it just for me and it was after 6pm. I ordered the Russell and I was sitting there a few minutes later texting my boy and here came the server with a cup of coffee! I was so grateful! Then almost immediately came the burger. It's made with blu cheese and mushrooms so it's a little sloppy but I'm telling you, it is amazing. As I was eating a few of the other staff came and checked on me. It feels really good as a patron to have a staff that works hard and shows they care instead of what you find at a lot of the disgusting fast food joints. Definitely a worthwhile experience and Farren's will definitely become one of my regular stops downtown."}
{"text":"Before heading to Champaign for work this time I did my Yelp homework and wrote down Farren's.  When I asked co-workers if they'd been there, a couple said \"yes, great burgers'.  So seven of us gave it a try for lunch today.

We split some apps - the housemade potato chips with truffled salt (if you know me, you know I have a not so secret love for all things truffled), the deep fried cauliflour and wings.  The chips were hot and the salt was flavorful (I asked for extra salt, and there were little black specks in there so I was pretty excited).  Cauliflour was a bit underfried.  Wings were OK.

I had the Motherlode burger - a huge, juicy patty topped with swiss, mushrooms and a blue cheese sauce.  Very nice.  Thick burger, but not a bit dry.  Soft bun.  We all commented on the burgers (co-workers got the green chili, a bacon cheeseburger, and another one that slips my mind but smelled amazing with a pile of cooked onions on top).  Others got the seafood etouffee (meh) and a chicken sandwich with pesto sauce.  Obviously come here for the burger!!

My burger came with a side of tortilla chips for around $8.  Upcharge to get fries or up-upcharge for sweet potato fries or the potato chips.

Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and decisive (he told me to get the Motherlode over the green chili burger when I waffled).

Basement feel, schmasement feel...it is a bar.  Cool how the bathrooms connect you to nearby thai and sushi restaurants.  And the new parking structure right next door made parking a breeze - $0.75 for the hour and free on weekends."}
{"text":"All i have to say is, the most amazing burgers ive had in my life. After reading all the yelp reviews i just had to see what the hype is all about! Great beer selection also; esp being a girly girl and not liking beer..they had a variety of light and fruity ones. It's in a basement but you cant even tell; doesnt have a dungy smell or look to it. Def a hole in the wall worth going to!!!"}
{"text":"Farrens is a great place to eat! The hummus plate is very tasty, all the veggies on the plate are fresh cut. The burgers are top notch! 

The Kobe burger and Fries is one of the best Burger meals i have ever had. The salad just finishes the meal. 

A must try in Champaign!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed their veggie burger. It came with a cajun remoulade - yum! The fries were just all right (part of my reason for the 4 stars). They had a decent selection of drinks (wine, beers, spirits). The location is a bit strange - sort of in a back alley. I almost missed it! But The prices were fine and the ambience was just what I expected for a Champaign Pub. It was a bit chilly inside, but then again it was 20 degrees out that night."}
{"text":"I was desperate to try this place. It's has a tiny front and is easily missed because of the towering parking garage next to it. So, anyway, I was desperate to try this place and I made it 30 minutes before closing. Dear Gwen M., I don't know who your host was but when we walked in we asked if it was all right to order since they were so close to closing. The host was warm and welcomed us in. I ordered a black bean burger that was the best veggie burger I've ever had. There was some sort of roux sauce on the side that was equally phenomenal. I came her a second time with my parents who ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a bison burger. Neither of these were so great. They were a bit gamey. But I'll never forget you, my black bean."}
{"text":"A great looking hidden gem in downtown Champaign often voted best hamburgers in the area. This Irish bar has a grill right up to the bar and a nice dark decor with odd art on walls. A place where the academics come and dialogue while enjoying staple American eats. A good choice of drinks as well"}
{"text":"The best burger place in Illinois. The burgers are cooked to perfection and the onion rings are too good. It is in a weird location but I guess it works. You have to go here!"}
{"text":"Their food is awesome!  I've had an assortment of their appetizers, including their truffle chips, and they were all delicious.  

On three other occasions I have had a burger, the fish tacos and a salad.  The burger is probably one of the best in town, the fish tacos were awesome, if a little on the pricey side, and the salad (can't remember the name but it had chicken, strawberries and I believe some kind of creamy-ish strawberry vinigrette?) was one of the top three salads I have probably ever eaten in my life (maybe even top 2.)  

They have a stellar beer selection and you can see their kitchen clearly from the dining room.  That earns respect from me on two levels - 1. It is a ridiculously tiny kitchen to put out such good food so quickly and 2. YOU CAN SEE INTO THE KITCHEN! which means I can see that it is clean, that the people cooking aren't dripping sweat and boogies into my food and there are no small critters wandering around.  I have a great deal of respect for restaurants that are confident enough to allow diners a view of behind the scenes processes!  

Oh yeah, the guy that we usually get as our server is super nice, as are the rest of the staff.  And they are very knowledgeable about their food and their beer, etc...

Only complaints are: it is kind of a tiny place and some nights it fills up pretty quick so you have to wait in line watching everyone else drink beer and have a good time.  (Or just sit at the bar, which is fine too)  Also,  I completely agree with Teej on the Indiana Jones bathroom experience...ladies, when it's cold out, I would recommend avoiding the bathroom because it feels like it is outdoors and I thought I would freeze to the seat.

It's probably been really good for their business having that parking garage right next door.  And I know it looks like kind of a dingy little hole-in-the-wall because it is situated right next to \"creepy back alley,\" but don't let that fool you.  I missed out on this place for a few years just because I never noticed it and I perceived it as said hole-in-wall.

Happy booze and burger-ing!  Cheers"}
{"text":"I would like to consider myself a burger fanatic because I almost always choose it if available at a restaurant. That being said, I eaten my fair share of burgers both domestically and internationally. I can proclaim with 100% confidence that the Farren's burger is the BEST burger I have ever eaten in my 22 years of existence. 

There is so much juicy meat in the patty and I mentally prepare myself for my food to arrive. I always think that I will be able to finish it in one sitting, but who am I kidding? It is ginormous. I will admit that I was quite skeptical during my first visit to this establishment because I never imagined that I would enjoy the bleu cheese sauce. Now, I ask for extra. The only time I eat bleu cheese is when I am eating it at Farren's. As someone who has been repulsed by the idea of bleu cheese for a majority of her life, this fact is very significant. 

I order the Motherlode most of the time, while my boyfriend orders the Fire Burger. For first time visitors, I would recommend The Russell or Motherlode. If you love spicy food, then Fire Burger is the one for you!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the definition of a gem. Pretty well hidden, overlooked, but absolutely wonderful. Their burgers are unmatched. It quickly became a favorite for me and the guys. I can't deny that it's a complete hole in the wall place. But honestly that's part of why I love it. Farren's is fantastic, don't miss it."}
{"text":"Great burger. Love the blue cheese sauce. I always get the Russell. Fun place to eat and get a drink. Can be really crowded on weekend nights."}
{"text":"I lived here for two years before I noticed this place - it really is hard to find from the street, even though it's in downtown Champaign. Never had a bad meal since then, though. Great juicy burgers, and their strawberry and walnut salad is one of my favorite summertime meals. 

I always feel bad for the cooks in their little tiny kitchen tucked into a corner of the dining room, but they send simple, honest, tasty food out of it."}
{"text":"AMAZING BURGER!!! BEST IN CHAMPAIGN/URBANA!! 

The only complaint I could have is the slightly oblivious servers. We had the same server both times, rarely received refills and waited a long time for our check. It seems that ever when other servers walked by a noticed our empty glasses .. they didn't bother to assist! 

But when in good company of friends .. I could care less about my glass and an amazing burger!"}
{"text":"We heard this was the place for an outstanding burger, and we were not disappointed.  I tried \"The Motherlode\" (proper diet be damned!), which is smothered in mushrooms, swiss cheese, and bleu cheese sauce.  It was phenomenal.  While I was a little sad that I couldn't really taste the bleu cheese (surprising, considering its sharp taste), the burger itself outweighed any negatives.  It was huge and succulent, and I swear to god, they must use an actual charcoal grill.  So. Damn. Good.  Plus, it came with about a full pound of thin fries (good, but vastly improved with a few shakes of salt and/or ketchup).  I was absolutely stuffed (to the \"ow, my stomach\"-point) after leaving.

The pub itself is hidden away behind Nitaya Thai and down a ramp.  It has a pleasantly dark, red and brown color scheme.  Our waiter was very nice and efficient.  Plus, they seemed to have an excellent beer list.  

We all know I'm coming back.  The challenge is how to come back as often as possible without gaining 50 pounds.

P.S. They had a Kobe beef burger special when I went.  I'm still kicking myself for not getting it.  Who wouldn't want a burger that comes from cows that had been massaged and subjected to classical music beforehand?"}
{"text":"When I crave the best burger I can put my hands on in Urbana-Champaign, I crave a Farren's burger. The meat grind is high quality with enough seasoning and fat to deliver flavor  -- that's the start of any good burger, and Farren's has it down. The burgers are huge, the buns are sweet and fresh, and the toppings are simple and flavorful. Which burger you like best depends on your taste. My favorite is the Spiccoli, with bacon, sautéed mushrooms, sautéed onions, and choice of cheese (I go cheddar, but there's also American, Swiss, pepperjack, habanero/jalapeño, provolone, feta, and blue to choose from). 

Order the house-made fries for a side. Not only do they taste as fresh as they are, but they are also perfectly crispy outside while tender inside, cut to the ideal size for dipping and crunching (not string, not steak).

As for appetizers, we've tried the buffalo wings with blue cheese dressing. The dressing is fresh, with big chunks of blue cheese, and the wings are huge (we joked about the impossible size of those chickens). They're seasoned and otherwise plain -- not dunked in some cheap sauce -- with a fresh chicken bite. So, so good. I've sworn to get this every time I go back. The fried cauliflower is good, too, but just not quite as good as the wings.

The only negative note we've ever had was that my partner ordered a veggie sandwich on one occasion (the spinach and mushroom, which includes grilled tomatoes and blue cheese). He found the spinach flavorless (after a taste test, I had to agree), really the whole sandwich underwhelming in flavor, and the overall gummy, slimy texture of the filling off-putting. Of course, he's the one who ordered a veggie sandwich at the best burger place there is. Really :) . 

Back to the good, we like the atmosphere at Farren's. It's got a relaxed, grown-up, neighborhood gastro-pub feel. 80s music is often playing and Gen Xers like us seem to frequent Farren's as much as the cool kids. Tables are decently spaced (you don't feel like you are on top of other diners) and the waitstaff are attentive and friendly. 

Even with ordering fries and other items on the side, the food is a good value given the carefully chosen ingredients and delicious preparation.

There's no parking lot specifically for Farren's. It's a little hole-in-the-wall place at basement level down an alleyway behind main street stores in downtown Champaign. But street parking is available and you can also use the lot across the street."}
{"text":"The scallop salad is to die for. $14.95, loaded with grilled scallops, romaine, walnuts, grapes and a splendid dressing. 

The place was packed tonight, a Friday night, and we waited 15 minutes for a table to open up.  Huge soft drink glasses are a trademark of Farren's and of course, excellent burgers.
Onion rings, tri-colored chips, fries and great salads.

The 600 space parking garage right next door has changed this from a dark hideaway to a prominent location with covered parking 20 feet from their door.

The restrooms can be nasty and are shared with a couple of adjoining restaurants."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends and had a very pleasant experience. 

Wait staff was prompt and inviting. 

I had the steak and it was cooked to my specifications and the sides were very good.

Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the best place to get a burger in the Champaign-Urbana area this place is amazing their onion rings are wonderful they use extremely high-quality ingredients high quality food the place is a busy place so you do have to wait but that's what is good food takes time that's why it's always busy it's where the locals go it's not some ridiculous chain restaurant thank you it has an amazing selection of drinks and it is also family-friendly if that's not your taste"}
{"text":"So tasty! I had heard that they had the best burgers in town, so I went, me and my friends all got different burgers, and they did not disappoint. Fries are pretty standard, but burgers are fantastic."}
{"text":"I happen to go here every birthday per tradition and it's definitely something I look forward to every year. Their burgers are solid and my personal favorite was a daily special they happened to have - burger with bacon and Gouda mac&cheese. Fries are good too. The place is small and \"homey\" but they often generate long lines out the door, so go early if you can (before 6pm)."}
{"text":"overrated. Maybe it was just the one day that I went. They were really busy that day. The portions are huge and it looked great but overall the burger was bland and the fries as well. Everyone in my table felt the same way and thought it was an underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"definitely a place for yummy burgers!

 don't need to get too complex or over think on the menu...order a burger.  trust me. any burger....well maybe except veggie burger (that is not really a burger right?).   the burgers are griddle cooked so they are juicy, but apparently, they don't bother varying the temperature when you order.  so all burgers came out grey in the middle which is not the end of the world.  its a yummy burger, good seasoning and massive (1/2lb patties \"this is not a steak and shake thin patty\"). the bun holds up really nicely to the size and greasy drip of fat....oh i want another one now man!

had the spicy habenero/jalapeno cheeseburger and fries, (which i thought was the best option amongst the add on sides).  portions are good enough to make sure you don't get hungry and have a little snack about 3hrs later when you start thinking about what to do for dinner. 

the house potato chips were great as well, just thick enough for some heartiness, but retains its crisp of a chip.  I detected some truffle flavor which I turn a nose on.  

the standard side of tortilla chips was pretty decent as well.  

we had a larger party of 10, which they were able to arrange us nicely combining a few tables.   it gets packed for lunch with a constant flow and queue but its well worth the wait.  

I counted only a couple servers but they were great and helpful.  The server asked us how we would want to split the check up before we even ordered - smart man.

I'd go back again, but only if I'm ready for downing another huge yummy burger with fries and washed down with a nice cold beer or a gigantic 32oz pepsi."}
{"text":"It's fine. That's the best I can say about it, and in my book, fine is a four-letter word. The end first; my bill for one so-so Bloody Mary, a burger and fries was just about $20 BEFORE tip...just for lunch. I got there right when they opened, at 11 and was seated right away. Ordered the cocktail that took close to 15 minutes to get, then ordered burger and that took another 25 minutes. I didn't get out of their until well after noon. By then the place was packed. Nothing special, the burger was, I think, pretty much the cheapest thing on the menu. The blue cheese sauce was good, but so runny, it fell off. The fries, while homemade, are fine. I doubt I'll return, unless someone else suggests it to meet there....and I eat out a lot. The atmosphere was par for a sports bar/burger joint....but, at their prices, it should be a fine eating establishment."}
{"text":"I really love the russell burger and the fries were so yummy and also my Fat tire beer  it seems so hidden but my friends said to try the burgers  
I'm glad I came . And the atmosphere was kinda laid back but pretty cool place too hang out and eat those delicious  burgers.  I will be coming back 
ALOT !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town. 
Make sure to try the one with the blue cheese!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great hole in the wall place.  It isn't the easiest to find if you haven't already been there.

They have a lot of good food and the service is very courteous.

I have been here several times and only had problems once (it was just waiting a while to get the check) which can happen when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Farren's is the prototypical hole-in-the-wall establishment. Out of the way of the regular downtown foot traffic, it's located in an alley. But every time I go there, it's packed to the door. 

The food is amazing. I love the green chile cheeseburger because it reminds me of home. Ask them to replace the pepper jack cheese with cheddar. Don't bother paying extra for a fancier side order to replace the tricolor chips - they're amazing. Ask for extra salsa!

The service is alright - sometimes you have to flag down a server, but the place is super busy, so it's understandable.

Not good for a quick bite. Not open late. Be prepared to wait. 

A party of two will be sat almost immediately at the bar. Any party bigger than that must wait."}
{"text":"Tried Farren's out for the first time last night and WOW.  I have been in CU for several years now and hadn't heard of this place until checking reviews on Yelp.  The burgers were a bit pricey but quality was very good.  The key lime pie is also a must-have."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating Pesto & Cheese Sandwich with Fries. Also we had Mozzarella Cheese sticks as our starter, which was tasty but lesser quantity than we had expected based on its price.

Overall, great experience for an American meal in Champaign. Quality of service was also great. Would go there to have a good sandwich / burger there again."}
{"text":"My go to place whenever I stop in Champaign.  Granted, it only has been 2 times in the last 6 years (for Badger away games) but both times I left impressed.  We stopped in last weekend after the game and found people already waiting to get a table.  Luckily, there were spots left at the bar to saddle up to.  The tap list itself is rather small (perhaps 4-5 choices) but Farren's shines in their bottle and can selection.  Foodwise, you can't go wrong with a burger.  Fresh ground meat, a great bun and cooked to perfection.  I opted for the Russell-mushrooms, bacon, pepperjack cheese and blue cheese sauce.  I was skeptical with mixing the two cheeses but I soon turned into a believer upon my first bite.  The burgers are huge and I couldn't imagine someone opting to add another patty to something this large (it is an option).  
Our bartender was great and quick to take our order and bring out food.  
No clue when I will be back to Champaign but when I do, I guarantee I will be back to Farren's"}
{"text":"Probably the best burger in Champaign.. Not enough meat with one patty? Double it up and go all out. Small seating area but usually still don't have to wait in this tucked back treat."}
{"text":"Big burgers and handcut fries.....it was ok....seemed pricey...."}
{"text":"Bacon Cheeseburger-yum!  Excellent bean burger for my lunch mate as well, terrific service!  Just don't expect fancy decor and you'll be good!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint in Champaign. I got a burger with blue cheese sauce in it and it was RIDICULOUS! The atmosphere is not the greatest but I go to a restaurant to eat and if the food is this good I can deal with a lacking atmosphere."}
{"text":"My brother convinced me to eat downtown instead of going out for Indian. Since I love burgers, he suggested that we go to Farren's. I have heard a number of good things about Farren's so I agreed. I was so surprised when we walked up to the building. I like holes in the wall, but boy is this one. There was a short line when we came in. There was no host in sight, but one came after a few minutes and we were seated quickly after that. 

My brother ordered The Russell with toppings for The Fire Burger (jalapenos, red peppers, onions). I ordered The Spicoli without mushrooms and added the blue cheese topping. My brother mentioned that he heard that the chips with truffle sea salt were pretty good. We asked our waitress if we could get the truffle salt on the fries, as well, and she said yes. So that is what I ordered. The burger was very good, but needed more bacon. The truffle salt definitely made the fries better than the regular- I tasted my brother's regular fries. They were a tad bit overcooked. 

I do find the place to be a bit dirty. The floor just felt oily underneath my feet. The bathroom was ick. And worn. Advice: Eat quickly and get out."}
{"text":"Great great burgers. Kobe burger cooked to chefs liking was perfect. Came down from Chi for work and I'm lucky to have found this place. I've been here 3 days and had dinner there twice. I'll eat there the next 2 nights with confidence."}
{"text":"I think it goes without saying that this is my opinion but a burger from Farren's is the best burger available in CU, no contest.  Fries are nothing special  but if yr looking for tasty fries you prolly know where to go (Courier, Esquire, Wonderdogs).  I stick with the chips that come with the burger.

Friendly staff - sorry to hear the other young lady found it to be too friendly, but I would suggest it's better than the alternative.  I guarantee that it's meant to make sure you are happy with your meal - more like \"when yr here, yr family\" than olive garden could ever be.

The best burger around, period.  Nice selection of good salads too."}
{"text":"Best salads eva! Scallop salad is ahhhmazing and it's huge. There's a strawberry chicken salad that my friend always gets and it looks delish too. Both salads have fresh strawberries, a delicious dressing and these crunchy cracker things on the sides that are also very good. Everyone I know loves the burgers here, I haven't had one but the French fries are to die for. The place is pretty cold in the winter months so dress warm, summer the AC is running and it's chilly then too so bring a jacket. It's a very casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for our last visit to Farren's. Not normally the type to review restaurants, but this particular experience was disappointing especially because I actually really enjoyed this place in the past. 

As mentioned, we've eaten here multiple times and have always thoroughly enjoyed it. We come for the burgers and they definitely satisfy that craving. The service in our previous visits has been great. Even when they are in the dinner rush, the servers we've had in the past were very attentive. I've been here as a party of two and as a party of eight, and both times, they did not disappoint.

I say all that to preface the disappointment of the most recent visit when we came in around 6 pm as the dinner rush was just starting. We were seated, got our waters, got our orders taken, and that was the end of our service. For 45 minutes we waited to get our food or at least some kind of update as to why there might be a delay. I realize 45 minutes isn't exactly forever, but it's definitely a long time for Farren's in my experience. Even when we came for dinner with a party of 8, I don't think we waited more than 30 minutes. And even then, the server we had was letting us know how much more time we could expect to wait and was making sure drinks  were taken care of.

We didn't get that this time. We got a server we've never had before, and we just noticed as he served and brought food to all the tables that came in after us. After the 45 minutes, we were convinced our order had been forgotten so we left. It just sucks because again, we were definitely fans of this place."}
{"text":"Farren's Pub & Eatery is has a casual type of atmosphere. It's a great place to go with your friends to enjoy good American style food and drinks. Their burgers here are so delicious and juicy! I'm almost getting hungry right now just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Service was great, very attentive even if they were swamped. Maybe it's my fault because I ordered a burger that was too spicy for me to handle, but I expected a lot better. Will definitely visit again and get something that is easier to enjoy."}
{"text":"Exceedingly mediocre experience. I've heard numerous rave reviews about this \"hidden gem\" but after eating here I'm truly puzzled. Am I in the right place?
 
Poor beer, wine and food selection (as in no selection). We tried the fried ravioli which were served on a bed of wilting lettuce. The mediocrity pushed us to ask if they were made in house-- our server told us no with an apologetic smile. Then why exactly am I paying upwards of $9 for this frozen bullshit? 

We had a real good laugh about all the upcharges for our choice of side. Tortilla chips come standard and it's extra for fries?! Cmon. I really should have known something was amiss when our server neglected to ask how we would like our burgers cooked. The bacon on my burger was undercooked and chewy, while the patty was wayyy overcooked. No pink in sight. 

Be sure to check out Farrens if you don't have any taste buds or standards for your dining experience!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Champaign and heard a lot about Farren's. My boyfriend and I have been there many times. We love the relaxing and hipster atmosphere. The service is great -- everyone is genuinely friendly. The food is excellent. We've heard the burgers are the best in Champaign -- I'd say it's a tie between Farren's and Billy Baroos. I love their salads (although , I wouldn't recommend paying extra to add chicken.)  Overall, a great local place you should try."}
{"text":"Great bar for food and drinks!! Small location is the only thing making me give it 4 stars instead of 5. If they are busy you will generally have to wait a while as they do not have too much seating inside the bar. They have a great alcohol selection and great burger selection."}
{"text":"Be cautious of the red hair waitress!!!!! Have to say firstly, when we went there today like 11:30 am, there were nobody inside the store at all. I know it is a pub-ish place, but I brought my 1 year old daughter simply because I heard their burger could be impressive. Turned out, not at all, just normal burger with an overcharged price, that is all. And what came next is what made me determined not to visit any again. My daughter needed to get her diaper changed before we leave, and the RED HAIR WAITRESS immediately showed indifferent look on her face and impatiently assign us to their shared toilet where no place can be used to change diaper if you don't count the dirty mosaic floor. I am pretty sure if they can, they will cancel the in-store highchairs and post a \"no kid allowed\" sign. In conclusion, Mediocre FOOD and WORST SERVICE in Campaign area."}
{"text":"The Russell is a must have. I recommend getting it with a Kobe patty."}
{"text":"A little place tucked away in an alley? It's worth a try, right? I went here with a group of friends on a Friday night. It looked busy when we walked in but we had no problem getting a table for the 5 of us. 

I loved the variety of draft beers here and enjoyed trying out a few as well as trying sips of my friend's drinks. 

The menu had a lot of options but it looked like the star of the show was the burgers so I went with the Green Chile Burger.  I thought it might be too spicy but it ended up being not bad at all and I think it could have actually used more kick.  The fries were delicious. 

We did have a little mess-up with our order when a friends didn't get her onion rings, but as soon as we notified our server of the error, he apologized and went to put in an order for the missing rings. We also had to switch servers halfway through our meal (not sure what happened to our first guy, maybe his shift was over?), but we had no problems still getting our correct checks."}
{"text":"I wish this place was a \"locals only\" hidden gem...

The Kobe Burger with their signature in house fries is by far the best burger in town. Great salads for anyone looking to have somethings a little lighter. Hipster employees with a cool atmosphere makes this place a must stop for anyone who comes to Champaign..... lol even though i wish they wouldn't."}
{"text":"Ah yes, Farron's. Welcome to my service full of fail poop list. While the food here is tasty, the service leaves much to be desired. There's simply no good reason to have people wait when there party is only one short and half the tables are empty. Nope. No. Oh hell no.

So if you want a burger downtown try Big Grove, Distihl, or even Guido's (the service is only marginally better than Farron's). If you want the best burgers for your buck though try Jurassic Burger in campus town.

Word to the wise, #servicematters"}
{"text":"The bacon cheeseburger was the best burger I've ever had. Fries and soup were also very yummy. I have had the bacon BBQ chicken sandwich and the chips. Absolutely amazing!! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I was seated near the door so my spot was a little drafty, but my burger was huge and absolutely delicious! I also tried the homemade potato chips at the recommendation of a random fellow patron, and those were pretty good. I'd certainly come here again, but cross my fingers for a warmer seating section."}
{"text":"Update!  I've since not had a problem with the tea tasting old, and have had a couple of salads that were much better.

Best burgers in town, in my opinion. They're always cooked to perfection, with an appropriately proportionate bun and delicious, thick, crunchy pickles. And, if you're pretty starved, I suggest getting fries on the side. They're toasty brown and delicious, especially when doused with malt vinegar.

They also have a full bar and great apps, specials, and desserts. I sometimes just get the hummus plate app for dinner. And the fish n chips special is pretty darn good for being land locked. As for desserts, if they happen to have the chocolate chile cheesecake, DO IT.

The environment is very laid back and the restaurant is fairly dim. There are a couple of TVs, but if you don't like to be distracted, you can sit away from them.
Beware days of Illini games; they are packed to the gills at dinner time."}
{"text":"Finally went here after hearing how good it was. Overall, I was pleased.
I'm a firm believer that burgers can only be so good. That being said, these guys make a pretty good burger. 

I got a bacon burger with bleu cheese crumbles. The meat was cooked almost perfectly and I got a generous heap of cheese on top. I almost couldn't taste the bacon though...I would suggest they kick it up a notch.

I found it odd that the default side is tortilla chips. They are pretty average, but do have a nice seasoning and taste good with their in-house made salsa (had to ask for it, though). It was fresh-tasting and not too spicy.

Beer selection is good. They had about 5 beers on tap and a healthy list of bottles. The bottle selection was not what you typically see at a burger place, which I liked. Prices weren't too bad either.

I'd come here again, for sure. If anything, I want to try that bison burger that people have been talking about. I LOVE bison burgers, but wanted to try their more traditional burger to see what all the fuss was about. It's a nice atmosphere. Everything is right there. There's no \"back\"; you can see the kitchen and where all of your food is coming from. I don't feel like I'm in some underground burger basement, but a nice, low key, bar where I could go on a date or get drinks with friends. Definitely recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Many will tell you this is the best burger in town. Im not sure if I would go that far (Black Dog and Crane Alley will give it a run for its money) but it definitely wont disappoint if you're looking for a BIG, tasty piece of beef between two buns.

Location is a little out of the way as it is basically in a basement in downtown Champaign. You will miss it if you are not looking for it. 

Fries are very tasty. Service is good. Prices are a little steep for a burger. Solid place"}
{"text":"I've been to Farren's twice - once in my freshman year, and again in my final year at the U of I.  I'm very sad that I haven't been more.  Farren's is a hidden gem with friendly staff, a lively atmosphere, and probably the best burgers in Champaign-Urbana.  I've got a weak spot for places that serve great food WITHOUT an attitude."}
{"text":"They have the second best burger in town, after black dog. But their burgers are great and flavorful. I can never eat fast food burgers any more. They also have a good beer selection. I like the \"hole in the wall\" feel since this place can be hard to find for first timers."}
{"text":"Almost passed on Farren's tonight with the line reaching the door thanks to the Taste of Champaign. 

Glad I stayed. 

Not only did the wait staff do a fantastic job of keeping the line moving, but the kitchen produced a fantastic burger in an expedient manner while they had a full board throughout my entire stay. 

Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Farren's has an awesome burger. My burger had a very thick patty, bleu cheese, bacon, sautéed onions, sautéed mushrooms, lettuce, and onion. The patty was very thick and juicy, and the buns were fantastic. The burgers come with tortilla chips, but you can substitute the chips for fries or onion rings at an additional cost. The burger alone costs between $8-9, and you will be paying around $9-13 for your entire meal, depending on what extras/substitutes you get. I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The space is pretty tight here, but if you avoid the lines, you'll be satisfied. Hamburgers are their specialty, with the \"Russell\" as their house style."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and the wait was not too long, only about 10 mins for a table for 2 since we had just beaten the 7pm dinner rush. We got the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and it was not too special, pretty pricy as well ($8 for 6 mozzarella sticks). I ordered the mushroom cheeseburger and it was delicious! Very decent pricing and large portions as well. Service was good and overall I'd come here again for a casual meal."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was a little disappointed. I just got a basic burger (the first one on their menu with a fancy name). The food was average, neither great nor bad, but I guess I just had a higher expectation from a yelp-4-star place. The ambient was a little better for a place that's very hidden by the alley. I would rather go to Desthil next time where they have better drinks and the same quality food in the same price range."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, enjoyed the small resturant over big chain. Service was good as well.  It was very busy every table filled but still had drinks kept filled and food came out hot and fresh in a decent amount of time. I got the Sponoli burger it was amazing and the onion rings are homemade tasted fresh. Others at my table got the venison burger which my brother loved and the Russell burger also great reviews from all at the table.  Highly recommend this restaurant!! Waited said they were just voted one of the best burger joints in town."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and fresh cut fries. Great service. Nice little local joint. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best veggie burger I've had in a long time, and the sauce that came with was so good my friend next to me used some on her burger as well. Very satisfied with the portion size for the price you pay. Loved how attentive the staff was and how they all come around to check on you, but not overwhelmingly so. Only critiques are that the fries were nothing special and the server did not ask for my ID when handing them my debit card (yes I'm that person that writes SEE ID). Overall very satisfied and will be returning."}
{"text":"I wanted to be a Farren's lover, but after several visits, I just don't get it.  It's a slightly overpriced burger with upcharged everything (chips, fries, sauce, etc..) and you have to request tomato and pickle? Give me a break. You don't have a server assigned to your table, because you can \"ask any staff member for anything\", not surprisingly, service is spotty. 

The \"kitchen\" is a flattop with a couple fryers next to the bar. It is remarkable that the cooks produce the volume that they do, however, seeing their space, there isn't any room for them to actually making anything in house, so it's probable that most items on their menu are bought frozen.

For a burger, you'll pay the same price at Big Grove for much better food and service."}
{"text":"Fantastic hand cut fries and gourmet burgers in downtown bar and grill atmosphere.  Worth the wait for a table. Great service."}
{"text":"The Burgers and hand cut fries are amazing. Also some of the friendliest staff in town. Definitely going to come back if I'm back in champaign."}
{"text":"I just moved my daughter into an apartment for college and stumbled on Farren's. We had a great burger and ice cold beer after a long drive and move in. I had the bacon feta blue cheese burger and it was terrific. Fries. onion rings and chips were all great. Service was very good. Thank you Farren's!"}
{"text":"oh hey best burger i have ever had in my life. service was quick and good. we got there earlier but as we were leaving the wait was getting long. they seemed understaffed service wise. but they handled it well. get the chips not the fries."}
{"text":"I think one sentence sums this place up perfectly... \"Greasiest Food you Will Ever Eat.\"

There's a lot of hype and praise about this place, but I really can't dig it just because all the food comes out dripping in grease.  It's a burger and fries type of place to begin with, but even the soups come out with heavily oiled broth and salads loaded with Oily salad dressing (definitely ask for it on the side so you can spare yourself the grease attack)

My co-workers love this place so I go every now and then, but of all the different dishes I've ordered, they were all dripping buckets of grease.  Sure it's tasty, and I will always dig some greasy food, but this is really too much... Way too much.  Burgers, fries, salmon burgers, steaks, chicken sandwiches, salad, etc.  it's all pouring oil out the wazoo.  

I got to say the service is exceptional though.  Every time I've went the service was very friendly, quick, and our food always came out fast.  Prices are reasonable too.  As for the atmosphere, I can see some people digging it but it's quite \"unique\" to say the least.  You really would never even be able to guess this was a restaurant looking at it from the outside.  There's a sign on the main road for it, but then you got to walk into the block a little bit and its in a plain colored building, hid away in a little nook.  It only gets more \"interesting\" as you go in and descend into the restaurant.  Yes, it's in a sort of a basement almost.  

I'm not against the place by any means, and the food is OK and the service is great.  It's just far too greasy for me.  It's just a place for those that don't mind really really greasy food."}
{"text":"I'm in the middle of another one of these week-long jaunts through the midwest and found myself in Champaign and needing lunch.  I've sampled some pretty caloric fare over the last few days, so thought I'd try something a bit lighter today for lunch.  Stopped in to this place and saw that they had a strawberry salad with chicken and a raspberry vinaigrette and got that with spinach subbed for the mixed greens.

Service was friendly and astonishingly quick.  Salad came back in probably under 3 minutes from the time I ordered it.  So that was good.  And the salad TASTED great. So why am I giving this place three stars?  Well, first, in order to get 5 stars you have to be really exemplary.  This place was very good in a lot of ways and would probably get a 4* rating from me except.... they REALLY need to work on their presentation.  

The salad shows up and it has a lot of great things going for it... spinach, strawberries, walnuts, grapes.... and then they had this huge pasty white chicken breast thrown on top in a single form and they had the garishly pink vinaigrette just poured right on top.  The salad LOOKED horrible.  I'm not sure how they cooked the chicken, but based on the way it looked, it could have been boiled because it was just this pasty, gelatinous pale breast that was completely unappetizing. And the pink dressing on top of it didn't help.

I strongly considered eating around the chicken, but brought myself to taste it and it was actually really good.  I just don't know how they cooked it to make it look so horrible.  So my suggestions for this restaurant when serving a salad that includes chicken: Throw it on the grill for a few seconds to give it some grill marks or do SOMETHING to give it some color.  And then toss the salad to mix in that pink dressing.

So good food, good service, but presentation of my dish kept this place from getting 4*"}
{"text":"Great burgers and excellent fries. As a burger fanatic I really enjoyed the spicoli burger, patty was excellent but perhaps could have used some more of the toppings listed on the menu. The fries are amazing, thin and crispy and definitely worth the upcharge. However, for lunch on a Saturday our food took forever to come out even though the restaurant wasn't full. We were seated immediately but waited at least 45 minutes for four burgers. The burgers are head and shoulders above any other burger I've had in the CU area but that wait time was brutal. Hopefully that's not the case next time I'm here!"}
{"text":"We heard good things about Farren's and even a rumor that they have some of the best burgers in the CU area.

Well, the rumor was certainly confirmed.

The location is a little hidden, it's kind of in an alley and the restaurant is almost like a basement. It's nothing fancy and probably doesn't want to be. We didn't have to wait to due a couple tables being open, but shortly after we were seated and as we were leaving a ~20 minute line formed.

Everyone ordered a burger and we got the homemade chips for an appetizer. These were good and a pretty large portion too. I got the Russell burger which came with bacon, mushrooms, and blue cheese. I opted for a side of fries which was an upcharge from the chips that normally come with it. The burger itself was large and very well put together. The toppings all complemented each other quite well, this was not your typical over-hyped pub burger. French fries were really tasty, too!

My only minor qualm with the place is the service. We had ~3 different servers/people who took our order, checked on us, brought our food out, etc. My beer was nowhere to be found after ordering it nearly 10 minutes ago, so I had to flag down somebody and remind them. This other server (maybe a manager?) had to re-check my ID before bringing me the beer immediately and apologizing, not a big deal! 

In the end though it was a good experience, the burgers met or exceeded expectations. I also liked how the whole menu was really straightforward, not overdone with 1000's of random items slapped together like some bar menus can be.

Strongly recommend, 4/5!"}
{"text":"I wish their menu had a little more things to order but the burger was fantastic. Fries were definitely fresh and delicious. Even had my favorite beer ON TAP! Weihenstephaner."}
{"text":"A tiny little bar/restaurant in a basement basically.  It is hidden back behind Nitaya Thai restaurant and can be hard to find if you did not know what you were looking for.  A bar runs a long the back, with tables scattered.  Very limited seating, so expect to wait if you get here at peak hours.  Very cozy.  The service is usually pretty good.  They do the best they can when the place is slammed.

Six quality beers on tap, much more in bottles.  So they got the good beer covered.  Full bar as well.  The food is great.  Some of the best pub grub in town.  Of coarse the burgers are what they are known for.  Which are great.  The salads are also really good.  A great place to come for a beer and a meal."}
{"text":"Farren's is one of my favorite restaurants in town. It's the kind of place you begin to frequent so much, the waiters remember your exact order. I have switched it up on occasion, and every single thing I have tried was awesome. My favorites are the tacos (chicken or black bean burger that come with sour cream and great salsa) and the chicken Caesar salad (homemade croutons, and the dressing is better than any Caesar dressing I've ever had); my husband always gets either the green chile cheese burger or the Kobe burger. The hamburgers here are very thick, so make sure you're hungry! You simply cannot go wrong with anything on the menu--it's that good. 

The ambience is one of my favorite things about the place; Farren's is located under ground and has a bar, enough room for large groups of friends, and doesn't feel stuffy. In the winter it can get cold in there, so make sure you bundle up."}
{"text":"Them burgers is huge, boy.  And tasty!  Way better than a Royale with cheese!.  Or a Big Kahuna Burger.  I do love the taste of a good burger."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers, salads, casual dining.  Service has always been friendly and efficient.  Long beer list, though no Heineken.  Parking in massive city garage right next door.  Usually busy, though I've never waited long."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. Make sure that you are willing to pay more for better food when you stop by, b/c this is definitely a step above pub grub. They use interesting local ingredients (lemon chive potato salad was awesome). Their beer menu is not as vast as some nearby joints, but they have a few shining stars. Right now they have a special on Krusovice, a great Czech pilsner. Service is fast and friendly at the bar. On the not-so-good side, when I visited a while ago, their selection for vegetarians was notably lacking. This has improved somewhat."}
{"text":"So, went here on a busy Saturday night.  Took about 30 minutes to get a table, but that's pretty expected with a place this small and popular.  

The burgers are what everybody seems to rave about, so that's what I ordered.  I ordered the \"Fire Burger\" (I think that's what it was called).  It's a decent size burger patty (probably like 1/3 lb or so) topped with roasted jalepenos, red peppers, and finished with some jalepeno/habenero cheese.  The waiter warned me that \"if you're worried about it being too spicy, it is.\" 

Well, it only took about 10-15 minutes for the burger to arrive, which is pretty decent considering how busy it was. 

I'm giving the place 2 stars for a few reasons: the \"Fire\" burger was probably around a 2 or 3 out of 10 on (my) spicy scale.   The burger, although properly cooked and juicy (a nice medium-well), lacked seasoning and resultingly flavor. Between a lack of spiciness and lack of spices, the burger was pretty bland.  Add to that some undercooked and unseasoned fries to have a whole plate of bland. 

For burgers that cost around $9, I would expect a lot more.  I can't say its worth the wait and I definitely have no desire to go back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nifty burger place, this is the establishment you want to be at. Their Kobe burger is filled with fun flavor. The portabello mushroom dish is actually two large fried mushrooms. It can be a tad difficult to get the waiters' attention sometimes though."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday in November. We came around dinner time but more towards the end, so they were able to seat my group of 7 people as soon as we got in. The waiter was super nice. Since it was my birthday, he ended up not charging me for my meal, which was kind of him.  I ordered the Russell burger, which has mushrooms, bacon, jalapeño cheese and blue cheese sauce--amazing! It was juicy and huge, and extremely tasty. We also had dessert. I enjoyed both desserts, but I enjoyed the chocolate dessert even more. Just a little forewarning, the chocolate dessert is really really sweet. High risk for getting chocolate wasted! :-)"}
{"text":"Wow, never thought I'd think a burger is BLAND but there you have it. Zero seasoning and they overcooked both me and my wife's burger."}
{"text":"Had the Russell burger with onion rings.  Husband had the same burger with fries.  Food was excellent and service was fast."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Best burgers I've ever had. Not only is the meat quality top notch (shout out to ole time meat and deli shop) but the huge selection of cheeses is amazing as well! The fact of the matter is that I can literally have just a plain cheeseburger and it be phenomenal! But on top of that they have a great selection of different types of burgers. Try to get a side of blue cheese dressing, it's so good! Also we sat at the bar and were treated like regulars immediately. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? I am honestly obsessed with farren's. The burgers are phenomenal. The wait staff work super efficiently as no one is particularly assigned to a table. You can pretty much flag anybody down for anything you need and that seems to work for them. There isn't a lot of seating so on a busy day there might be a wait, but it is always worth it. I'm a big fan of the Russell Burger which is cheese, bacon, and mushrooms. The beef just tastes great and you get a mouthful for 10 to $15. They also have a good selection of beers if that's what you're into or a cocktail depending on the ingredients (there is a bar). I can't say how much I love this place enough. I brought my grandmother, who is not apt to like any bar in particular, and she loves it so much that every time she visits she asks that we go to the \"alleyway restuarant\" aka farren's. There is no outdoor seating so if you're looking for ambiance you might want to go elsewhere. But if you want really good burgers at a decent price and top notch service, then come right in!"}
{"text":"Really really solid. It's easy to miss this place, because it's tucked back off the street. The ambiance won't blow you away, but the bartenders know their stuff and are very funny, the burgers are great and the fries really make it. Plus they always have a decent and unexpected on-tap beer selection.
This is slowly becoming a favorite go-to place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend absolutely LOVES this place. I'm a little indifferent. This comes with a HUGE disclaimer that I don't really handle red meat well so, 80% of the menu is not an option. Last night, I had the veggie burger. I was sure to ask for all the extra fixings. Even so, they were still a little skimpy on the tomato. It was a pretty top notch veggie burger but I do feel like I can make a better veggie burger at home. I wish they had dijon mustard - only plain yellow mustard is available. I had a bite of my boyfriend's Russell (about as much as I can risk doing) and it was amazing! Boy was I jealous he can enjoy red meat this much! This is a pretty great place with tasty food, wonderful friendly service, and an awesome beer selection but, since the non-red-meat options take up such a small portion of the menu, I find myself easily bored with the menu. Beef lovers would give this place 5 stars easily."}
{"text":"The burgers and salads are wonderful. Definitely the best fries in town, and you can even order sweet potato fries. Great service, and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite hamburger place in town!! Their meat patty is real good! And it's so filling, can barely finish one in one sitting! Definitely worth eating out here! There is usually a line though, so I try to get there around 5 for dinner!"}
{"text":"So, it took 18 months but I finally gave Farren's another shot. As it turns out, they weren't as happy to see me as I was to see them. Or at least, their tall waitress with the red hair had a problem with me.

We walked in and asked for a table for two. Only four tables were occupied, but she motioned for us to take a two top table right between the order workstation and a loud table of about eight. I smiled and shook my head \"No\" - mostly because I'd twisted an ankle and didn't want to walk across the restaurant (painful) only to ask her for another table. I also didn't want to be in what I perceived as the loudest place in the restaurant - shoved up against the wall by the grill area and wait station with the loud group on the other side. Refusing the table apparently ticked her off: she looked seriously irritated and she showed us another table closer to the door, slammed the menus down so loudly that I jumped and then stormed behind the bar whereupon she made a less than kind remark (loud enough for me to hear) about my request to another coworker. I was astounded at her attitude. She didn't bring us water or ask what we wanted to order so when she walked by again I stopped her and outright asked her if she had a problem waiting on us, I received no response - just a glower. Fortunately a pleasant young woman with long dark hair waited on us and our meal and drinks were fine, and I enjoyed them even though the tone of the evening was spoiled by the ugly behavior of big red, the waitress with the matching mood.

I live in LA and don't get to Champaign as often as I'd like, but Farren's was always a favorite. Lately though, some of the employees have spoiled it as one of my favorite places. Frankly, I'll drive to Mahomet and JT's from now on - it isn't worth the negativity to go to Farren's."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Champaign!  I always get a bacon burger and it is amazing.  I have never had a burger under or over cooked.  The fries are always good.  I also love their beer menu.  I swear, nothing goes better with a bacon burger than a Scotty Karate Scotch Ale!  I have brought friends, family and girlfriend, with no complaints!  Parking is not an problem with the parking deck right next door."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! Their ground beef is unreal.  It's a disservice to the burger to put ketchup on these badboys.  They cook them well-done, and still they're juicy and tasty! My favorite is the Spiccoli, it's swiss, mushroom and onions.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"So, the lady's sister hit a car in a parking lot somewhere. So there's a new bumper for a car being painted in her garage on Sunday. The sister comes inside the house around 5ish, as we are trying to decide where to go to dinner. Name places... all no, finally \"Farrens?\" and it's a yes. We decide to meet there at 6:30. 
Drive from the country into town, and exit at Neil street from 74. As we are exiting, look to the north and see Toys R Us is packed, as is Olive Garden, and most everything else that way. 
Drive down Neil, turn onto Main, and all the restaurants in downtown are relatively empty: 301, Dublin, Big Grove, Guidos, Destihl... everything is relatively vacant. I start to feel sad, not for the empty restaurants, but for the people who decided that it was worth it to eat at Olive Garden. I felt genuinely sorry for people who thought that Olive Garden was a good decision. 
We park, and walk to Farrens. We go past more restaurants that have seats available, Miga, that Thai place... and still I'm thinking... FRIGGIN OLIVE GARDEN IS FULL!!!
We go down the ramp into Farrens. I make eye contact with the server He points to a table. No one else sees him point to the table. I go and sit down, they stand on the ramp, and are like \"You can't just go sit down, they have to seat you\". and i'm like... DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM!!! A little while later, I inform them that yes, he did tell us to sit there. 
We place our drink order, there's Triptych on tap, so that's nice. (Seems to be a recurring theme, that Triptych stuff is everywhere). I order a beer on draft, the lady orders a beer on draft. The sister asks \"do you only have that craft stuff on draft?\" She gets, I think, a Coors Light. How can you drink mass produced beer with craft food? 
Kridz orders the mozzarella sticks. I get the portabella mushroom appetizer. The moz sticks are moz sticks. Nothing too fancy (it seems) about them. The portabella mushroom is the entire cap, cut in half, breaded and fried, served on a salad bed. Hell, this thing is practically a meal to itself. For the actual meal, I order the Russell, you can't go wrong with sautéed mushrooms, bacon, blue cheese sauce and pepperjack cheese. BACON ON EVERYTHING!!! 
At some point before the burgers came out, we also ordered the mac and cheese. If this is on the menu, get it. The ladies at the table were like.. \"what is this puddle on the top? grease?\" and i'm like \"uh... that's butter\". Then they are like \"who puts butter in their mac an cheese?\" then go into a discussion of how they made their mac and cheese for holidays... this, this, this, butter, this, this... seemingly forgetting that they put in a whole lot of butter. Butter makes everything better, as does bacon. mmm bacon butter. 
I dive into my burger, I also got fries with that, fries are delicious, but unnecessary after eating some of the mac and cheese and the whole mushroom cap. I finish my burger. I have blue cheese sauce throughout my mustache and beard. Thus is the struggle I deal with. A drippy delicious burger, all throughout the beard. 
I have another beer. Everyone else finishes eating. The ladies sit around and wait for the sisters significant other to show up because... she locked her keys in her car when she parked. They wait, she will meet me momentarily...\"where are you going?\""}
{"text":"Farren's took a couple of times for me to warm up to.  Hidden by a parking garage, it's a bit lacking in curb appeal, but their burgers are GREAT.  If I'm not grilling, this is where I will have a burger.  And their tuna tacos -- yum . . . . the special is totally worth your money, it's a huge meal! 

The beers are usually around $5 for drafts, not cheap but in line with other Downtown restaurants. 

Don't bother with the tortilla chips, they're almost always stale. Get the fries. You know  you want them anyway. 

The tables are crappy, the ambiance not so chic.  But they make a fiiiine  burger."}
{"text":"Great burger!!!  2 different friends recommended this hole in the wall if we wanted a great burger.  Farren's did not disappoint!! I had the \"Russell.\"  It was wonderful with the bacon and sautéed shrooms with the blue cheese sauce. My wife had a the standard bacon cheeseburger with American. Plus, surprisingly the sausage, potato and kale soup hit the spot on a cool day.  It was very flavorful and just the right amount of peppery!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers!

Glad I finally got to try this place. The burger didn't disappoint. The only con may have been the waitress...she wasn't as fast in taking our orders and our checks, but it was also a busy day. 

Got the spicoli. Bacon, mushrooms, onions and cheese. Need I say more? It was so flavorful! The burger was perfectly cooked too (generous amount...). I was so full. Got the fries (you pay extra for these). Oh and a little suggestion--it was a bit misleading but we were told that you can order a half salad instead of the chips (so bizarre to me that they offer chips with burgers). However, note that you pay for the half salad so it's not a true substitution. This was not very clearly stated by waitress and a few people were disappointed to have to pay $4 or so extra for the side salad. 

The fries were good too. Aside from those issues, the burgers are tasty and I'd come back again!"}
{"text":"very chill place to grab a burger and drinks with friends.
The burgers are probably the best in the CU area and it's cheap. 
they have specials but they ran out of the fish and chips
I got the Fire burger and my friend got the Russell which were recommended by the waitor. 
the fire burger was very spicy which is good! 
the fries were amazing! the kind that's almost brown with a bit of skin on it. 
also got a beer there (O'fallen) it's a bottle but it was really sweet which is what I asked for."}
{"text":"Yup, I'm a fan. Solid burger, always cooked appropriately and always delicious. The truffle chips are good, usually a few under-cooked ones that slip by. Not the greatest burger I've ever had and I'm not holding them up to that standard.

Mostly I'm motivated to write a review because the negative reviews here are hilarious. If you want a well done burger then go to burger king and stop crying about your overly meaty sandwich. If you want a fancy restaurant get the F out of a corn field. Servers are people too and sometimes aren't perfectly attentive or perfectly cheery when you are a giant pain in their ass. After-all this is a bar, in a basement, in a college town. They make good burgers."}
{"text":"Great burger, with great fries (unfortunately extra -- the tortilla chips it comes with by default are good, but seriously it seems like a cop-out). The waiters were knowledgeable and friendly, but not overbearing. The vibe is, as people say, dark but cool, and it is very difficult to spot if you don't already know where it is.

One weird moment -- the first time we ever went to Farren's, my gf asked the waiter for a beer recommendation and received a \"Wheach\" -- a Peach Wheat. This was a very good selection, as it combines two of her favorite things: fruit-flavored beer and puns. The next time we went back, she asked for the Wheach -- and the waiter had no idea what we were talking about. Not \"we're out\" or \"it's no longer in season\" or \"we no longer carry that\" -- he had never heard of it. All of the beer we've gotten there since has been solid, but we never saw the Wheach again...."}
{"text":"Been to this hidden pub and burger place a few times and it's pretty good. Quick to seat us and plenty of different food options available. Prices aren't too much and I enjoyed the food I had there with my partner. Unfortunately, the service here always tends to be subpar at best. One server just disappeared on us halfway through serving. Good food with okay service, worth a visit though!"}
{"text":"Easily the best burgers in CU. I have eaten here more times than I can remember.  I would honestly pay double for the burger and still be happy. Great small hidden gem of downtown champaign with parking all around."}
{"text":"This has been a staple in our family's lives for the last 5 years, birthday parties, holiday parties, business meetings and countless family get togethers.  Caroline and her staff are the best!  I have never felt more comfortable and welcome in any restaurant!  The food is consistently amazing and the specials are always outstanding.  Fine food, great pub environment-family favorites include, hummus plate, wings, burgers (include specialty burgers)  chips and fish tacos and of course ice cold Krushevich on tap!!!!"}
{"text":"I would take off another half a star.. because I realized after I left that they never asked me how I wanted my burger done. I came here a few years back, and I think they changed their menu a bit. My party went for their burgers, and it still tasted as good as before. The bun was warmed nicely, and the burger tasted pretty juicy. However, since they kept the veggies on the side (lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions) I would have expected larger pieces instead of shredded lettuce so it would stay in the burger easier. The green chili wasn't all too noticeable, but added a nice chill to it. Friend also mentioned the fire burger had a nice spice level to it. Chips were eh, for the relatively inexpensive price, they charged extra for fries. Fries were ok, but a bit too salty imo. Would come here again- definitely seems better suited for smaller parties."}
{"text":"The kobe beef burger was probably the best burger I've EVER had. It was so tender and juicy. I'm not even a huge burger fan but I could go for this one anytime. Even my dad, who could eat a burger for every meal agreed with me here. It's the best burger in CU and regularly wins awards for it.

Really, everything I've tried there is very delicious and the food comes out fast and the service is super nice. Carolyn and her crew are so great and you're like family when you get in there. 

And unlike \"Nifty C.\" I actually really liked that you can see the guys cooking in the kitchen. Yes, it's a little dim in there, but I just think the setting makes the atmosphere a bit more casual and intimate.

If you're downtown for a casual meal, look no further than Farren's!"}
{"text":"I love the burgers.  The staff is always hella attentive and even when it's packed the line moves quickly.  The ambiance is also set up so that the customers are relaxed enough to engage with one another (if you choose, too).  If you are looking for a place where no one knows your name and has a good burger, this is the place."}
{"text":"Food: Amazing, as always. I got the Russell and the blue cheese sauce was delicious but on the saltier side. For people who do not like blue cheese it does not taste like blue cheese at all!

Substituted the chips for fries and the $1.50 was worth it. Portion size was big. 

The Strawberry chicken salad was good too but did not have a lot of strawberries...hefty amount of chicken 

Service: Great! Always checked up on the table. 

Place: Small cozy pub"}
{"text":"Just been here 2 or 3 times but I probably won't be going back.  

I find the layout irritating: it feels like a cramped and poorly ventilated basement cafeteria.  

Waiting a long time for service seems typical and on my last trip my friends and I waited about 10 minutes just to be recognized (I actually had to 

flag down someone by waving and shouting) then another 15+ to be seated. They could at the very least greet their customers and let them know the 

wait time.  There were people behind us who were seated before us because they had fewer people in their group, but looking around, they could have 

easily seated our group of 5 by moving some tables together (which they ended up doing anyways). Even after we were seated it took forever to get 

something to drink (even after ordering drinks it took over 10 minutes). 

Since you don't actually have an assigned server, you can be assured that many of the things you ask for will be forgotten by whomever brings your 

food, whenver they get around to bringing it.

Nothing particularly good to say about the food.  It was fine, I guess, but why is it so expensive?

Location: kinda lousy, service: kinda lousy, food: kinda meh.  Why bother?"}
{"text":"I like Farren's pretty well for a happy hour type dinner.  The grilled steak salad and sweet potato fries are my favorites.  

I've had super super annoying service more than once (not BAD as much as way too interested in starting a conversation and becoming friends with the diners), and every single time my friend has ever asked the kitchen to hold the french fries he has gotten an extra huge heaping load of french fries."}
{"text":"Man, were the truffle fries overhyped!! The waiter made it sound like a piece of heaven sprinkled with ocean salt, when in reality it's just chips. Other than the truffle disappointment, the burger was pretty good. Can't complain too much about a burger joint... it is what it is."}
