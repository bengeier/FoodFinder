{"text":"Great food, great service. Very accommodating.  Came in on a Sunday night and had our pick of tables. Staff was friendly and answered all of our questions about the menu. Food was great and portions were big- enough to bring home! Would come again."}
{"text":"Been here once several months ago for Sunday brunch. Not sure if they still serve brunch.   Food:  Chicken lollipops - delicious drumsticks, the green chutney dip cools the palette with the minty-yogurtyness but the chicken can be eaten without.   Eggs Benedict with masala fries - every component was a dance of flavour in my mouth! The poached eggs sat on top of pakora patties and topped with a masala sauce. The masala fries were not spicy spicy but had enough kick to make it stand out. The dish left me feeling on the heavy side, just walk it off and you'll be fine.   Service & atmosphere: The waiters were alright. The interior is updated and clean.   Price: The feeling of a satiated stomach is worth it for the price."}
{"text":"A great fusion restaurant right in the heart of St. Clair West, Ji is a reliable and fulfilling experience that's sure to please anyone who visits.  My friends suggested we visit this restaurant, which was taking part in Summerlicious and had a great selection of lunch items combining Indian and Western sensibilities. I went for the vegan Caesar salad (chick peas, cashew dressing, coconut flakes), the spicy beef burger (with masala fries) and a spiced chocolate brownie for dessert.  Everything was great across the board. I had never tried Indian fusion cuisine before, so this was a bit of a treat for me. The flavours didn't particularly stand out in the burger, but it was moist and delicious nonetheless. Most of my group went for the Tandoori chicken sandwich, which they reported was great.  If I have one complaint, it's that the chocolate brownie was dry. Perhaps it's just a side-effect of the cooking process or the spices they use, but I'm used to chocolate brownies being moist and easy to put a fork through. It could have done with a scoop of ice cream as well.  Regardless, for my first Summerlicious outing, Ji was a great option and had a fantastic menu. I also appreciate the restaurant's hiring of local servers - our waitress was fantastic and patient as she put up with a wait as more people show up, and she lives in the local area. This is what local restaurants should strive for - great food, great service and supporting the local community.  I will definitely be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Service 10 Atmosphere 10 Food 10 I am so impressed by this restaurant. Feel silly for not trying it earlier since so many people have told me how good it is. If you looking for amazing flavours and delicious food... this is your place. When you eat here you feel like everyone that works here actually cares that you enjoy your meal (which lets face it.. in Toronto that's not the regular) I highly recommend and will now be visiting this place often. 10/10. (I've never thought any restaurant was a 10 before this!!!!!)"}
{"text":"Came here for their summerlicious lunch meal and I wasn't disappointed! The food was amazing and was a perfect blend of flavourful spices!   We had: - Chilli tofu with vegetables - had a little kick to it but was super flavourful - Sweet Potato Chaat - amazing blend of mint, sweet and spice - Spicy Beef Burger - the onion pakora topped with the garlic mayo was   - Tandoori Chicken Burger with slaw - was my favourite. The tenderness of the chicken coupled with the tandoori flavour was to die for!  - Marsala fries were tasty along with he house made tomato ketchup  The desserts were good as well but their entrees and apps really shine here. Will def. visit again to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Oh my JI!  I love, love, love, loveeeee Indian food so this place was def a hit for me!  My friend and I came here on a Friday night. As we walked in we noticed the restaurant seemed to be a little upscale and boujee. The place was dimly lit with candles and we noticed very classy looking bar. I panicked a little inside, because I was in jeans and a hoodie! I doubt our server/host didn't mind as we were seated right away. *phew*  We ordered the Naanchos, Brisket Poutine, Macaroni Makhani and Chicken Tikka Masala.   5/5 Naanchos - Um...but can I give this a 6 out of 5? Because this was UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS! The crispness of the nacho chips and the blend of different sauces topped with the cheddar cheese - this was a party in my mouth! I would definitely recommend this app!  2.5/5 Brisket Poutine - My least favourite app. The fries tasted burnt. The brisket with the sauce made the fries soggy. I tried to mask the the \"burnt\" taste by smothering it in the sauce and noooope! It made it worst. Did not enjoy this at all.   3.5/5 Macaroni Makhani - I didn't love it but I didn't hate it. I liked the creaminess of the sauce but for some reason something was missing. I'm not sure if it needed a tad bit more flavour like salt, pepper or spices but it was a little bit bland for me. Sorry, I really wanted to like this dish.  5/5 Chicken Tikka Masala - Loved the balance of basmati rice and the chicken tikka masala. Not spicy but also not bland. It was really good!   3/5 SERVICE - The service started out really good. Our server was very friendly and checked up on us a couple of times in the beginning but towards the end, we were forgotten =( Can't blame him entirely as the night started to pick up. There were two other servers who noticed we were just sitting there, so they rotated with serving us. We waited awhile for the bill as well.   Despite this little mishap, I would definitely visit again. Maybe just not on a busy night...   TIP #1 - This place is a little hard to find and parking is crazy. There is a parking lot right beside a McDonald's on St. Clair and a little after Humerwood Dr. Parking there is insanely cheap! If I remember correctly it's about $4....  #2 - Dress a little cuter than usual ;) I'm sure the server didn't care I was in a hoodie and jeans but I definitely felt out of place."}
{"text":"What a cool vibe this place has. It's known for Indian fushion and it definitely delivers. We ordered the Mac and cheese (made it a combo with they're chicken lollipops), Hakka shrimp, brisket poutine,  and spicy beef sliders. This was enough to feed 4 people and the bill was around 80 after taxes and tip! We found the Mac and cheese too sweet (not really butter chicken) and quite honestly the chicken lollipops were good but TINY (hence word lollipop) I guess, this was disappointing as we came here for the Mac and cheese. Their Hakka shrimp was delicious as was their brisket poutine (crisp Fries!). Our favourite was the sliders. Only two came for the price with the slaw but they were very tasty! You can really taste the spices used and it was a juicy slider. I could have done without the slaw, too much mayo for my liking. And I must say,  they serve tea right. Served with a preheated cup and warm milk.  Perfect for the current weather (below zero). Would definitely come back to try more!"}
{"text":"Ji comes from the same owners of Pukka which is just down the street, and fills the space of what was once Concession Road (yup, same owners). We managed to get reservations for a Saturday night, and were happy we did make the trek up to St Clair Ave.  The general vibe is Indian food with fusion-esque type flair. For example the Macaroni Makhani is a sorta butter chicken meets tomato infused mac and cheese bowl of awesomeness. Masala Fries come on their own or as the base of a Brisket Poutine. Semolina Puffs are perhaps a bit less fusion, but still a super tasty cold starter with chickpea, potato and chutney in a small finger food shell.  Admittedly all the apps were top marks, and the mains were pretty solid...  The meat in both the Lamb Shank Roganjosh and Chicken Tikka Masala were cooked to awesome levels of tenderness and the side of lemon scented basmati rice that comes with them was perfectly prepared as well, but the sauces admittedly could have been a bit bolder and spicier.  Drinks wise, they have a handful of cocktails around the $9-$12 range and I will say that the Spiced Mojito was a wonderful mix of pineapple and ginger giving it a crushable taste but with a zesty kick. Beer options are limited but a decent selection of tall cans in addition to Beaus and Nickel Brook Gluten Free on tap.  I will say I loved the interior, from the blue booths and the contrasting wall art and even the plates being used matches nicely. Quite nice all in all, and while service seemed a bit confused at time, it was friendly and I felt that all in all this is a sold 4 star dining experience. Fully recommended, but get reservations as there was practically a line out the door when we were finishing our meal."}
{"text":"super cold winter night -10 degrees, but this place made me happy.   Decor was very pretty. We tried a bunch of Indian and fusion food: mac and cheese with chicken pops, chana masala, and the fish was also off the hook. adding a couple of fav wheat bears - it's like old world meets hipster... done well!  Impressed! Will visit again."}
{"text":"Ji is a trendy Indian restaurant, so don't expect classic Indian food at low prices. The menu fit its vibe, which seems to be Indian dishes with a twist.  Four of us shared a few dishes, the ones to note are: - Vegetarian burgers: I've tasted few vegetarian burgers that were enjoyable and Ji served one up that was flavourful and had texture. Vegetarian burgers always tend to be one-toned and tasted like one lump of carbs. Get these! - Semolina puffs: This reminded me of a marriage of two Indian dishes of papard chaat and pani puri. The best of both worlds. Sour, crunchy, spicy, smooth, such a party on one's tongue. As for the rest of the dishes... they were were average or below that bar: - Naanchos: First bite was striking, but it got salty. - Macaroni Makahni: All cheese, all mush and a tad oily. It didn't feel good to eat this mac and cheese twist. - Chana Masala: Classic Indian dish that didn't perform. It was meh.  For a great vibe and great service, go to Ji. The waitress was relatable, chill and fun."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We went on a Saturday night... extremely busy. We had reservations at 8pm and were seating around 8:30pm. We didn't mind the wait cuz we were able to sit at the bar and enjoy our drinks.   Once seated were we greeted promptly and were informed of the daily specials. The restaurant was so busy but, our waitress was wonderful and didn't make us feel rushed at all   We order the nachos... OMG! The lamb kabob.. the mac n cheese.. chicken lollipops and chicken tikka masala. Everything was beyond fantastic!   Very excited to visit this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! I've ate there twice . Food and service is great. My favourite is the lamb ... not much of chicken tikka masala .. but there's is very good. The macaroni is a fun twist ..."}
{"text":"Delicious food with very friendly service. Their menu was very unique with perfect portions. The drinks were average"}
{"text":"The decor here is great. It has a rustic modern feel to it with teal accents. The servers are nice and the food is good. We ordered the daily fish (sea bass) which is a coconut curry. Essentially it's butter chicken without the chicken and replaced with fish instead. It was good but nothing surprising. I also wished the fish I had was a bit thicker but it was cooked perfectly no doubt. Next we ordered the beef burger sliders which I thought were tasty but would have preferred a more Indian flavour. I know this is an gastropub and burgers should be on the menu but if it's a fusion place, I would have liked it to be more unique.   Now the dish that shined the most for me was the Hakka shrimp. It was a smaller portion considering it's price but the taste exploded in your mouth. The shrimp had this smoky grilled flavour & the sauce was sweet, spicy, & tangy. There was so much flavour that we asked them not to take away the bowl so we could mix it with my main entree's rice."}
{"text":"I usually write a review right away after I finish my meal. But for this restaurant I had to wait and enjoy the thoughts of a great meal I had.  I found out about this restaurant from summerlicous participants list.  I wanted to come to Ji for the summerlicious, but for some personal reason I was not able to commit to my reservation and I had to cancel.  This week I was craving a good curry, so I decided to go to Ji and give it a try.  The website looks okay and i tried to make a reservation by calling them, of course the restaurant was closed at 3:00 pm. Using Bookenda I made a reservation.  There is parking on the street, for Sunday they had a lot space available to park.  Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted by a staff member, and lead to my table. Looked at the menu and I had couple of things in mind.  I ordered the lamb seekh kebab, I wanted that as an appetizer but they served it as a sandwich, Sophie who was my server, was very helpful to make that possible.  The seekh Kabob were amazing, that is one of my favourite dishes if Indian cuisine, full of flavour and I would have 20 of them if I could.  Next course was chicken madras, it came with side of rice on one dish.  I always like my rice and stew separate so I could easily control my portions.  That was one of the best chicken madras I ever had, packed with Flavour, creamy and delicious.  I just wish the portion of rice and meat was equal but it's almost impossible to get that right.  I had to order more rice to finish the madras chicken.  Sophie did an amazing job and she was very helpful. Always checked to make sure everything is okay, and groomed the table once in a while.  I would most definitely come back again.   Cost: Bottled water ....$6.00 Papadums and chutney ....$5.00 Lamb kebab ......$18.00 ( this is a main dish, but I had it as an appetizer, I did not mind to pay full price) Chicken Madras ...$17.00 Red onion & chillies ....$ 2.00 Side rice .....$3.00 Tax Tips  ------- Total $69.16  Well worth the money."}
{"text":"Another solid addition by the dynamic duo (Harsh and Derek).  Ji gives you the comfort of Indian food, with pub-style-fusion-snack-flare. The menu is creative and playful. A must try for its difference and novelty.   It reminds me a lot of what the Han brothers did for Korean food in Toronto (Swish by Han, OddSeoul, Hanmoto). The Ji concept could potentially be a great one for late night eats a little further south. Harsh and Derek are on to something here.   If you're expecting a typical Indian meal, go two blocks west, but if you feel a bit adventurous and want to try new things, Ji's definitely where you want to be.    p.s special appreciation to the fact that this is probably the only restaurant in Toronto that serves Thumbs Up and Limca."}
{"text":"This is an Indian restaurant that has a bit of a pub feel. They have TV's etc for sports games but it still nice and pleasant enough for a date night or a nice dinner out.  I had the brunch here on a Saturday and wow, delicious. The Indian style eggs benedict amazing, the eggs with coconut curry sauce also amazing. The vegan ceaser and masala fries were also a hit.  The service is great and staff are very friendly and attentive. I'm sure dinner here would be just as good. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I would rate Ji a solid 4.5/5!  I actually heard about Ji from a friend and decided to check it out! So my friend and I made our way down on a Friday night and the location is actually perfect as it isn't in downtown Toronto where the drive can be hectic. Just a tip, if you plan to drive there, park at Saint Clair and Humewood Drive (right beside the McDonalds) as it was only $4 to park there between 6pm-8am the next day.   Anyways, let's get talking about what everyone is waiting to read about... Ji! To start off, Ji is decent in size as it has a second room for seating. The waiter was extremely nice and friendly. My friend and I ordered the Naanchos, Brisket Poutine, Chicken Tikka Masala and Macaroni Makhani. Let me just start off and say, EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING!!   The Naanchos were to die for!! I would totally recommend everyone ordering the Naanchos! I will say that it wasn't very big in portion, but it had a lot of flavour! The chips weren't your regular nacho chips, it was a mix between the standard nacho chips and naan and the toppings complimented the \"chips\" very well! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! My friend and I would agree that the Brisket Poutine was probably our least favourite out of everything, but it still tasted good and had great flavour!   Now for the entrée! The Chicken Tikka Masala was amazing! It had so much flavour! The only thing you wish for is more of it!! Really good and a good portion size as well! The Macaroni Makhani was delicious as well! It had the classic macaroni noodles mixed with an amazing cheese sauce fused with Indian flavours.  Overall, I would totally recommend checking this place out! I'm surprised it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be for a Friday night. You must try the Naanchos and Macaroni Makhani if you do go!"}
{"text":"A great take on Indian food for a pretty reasonable price in an casual-cute setting. It was flavourful, and among the most unique menus I've seen in a while. We took the waitresses suggestions for what to order, and aside from being incredibly polite and patient, her recommendations were largely positive.  For drinks we tried the mango lassi. Tasty, thick - nothing special, but made by a clear expert. Ordinarily spectacular, in a way. It's a small glass, though, so you may end up ordering one or two more. ;)  I came with four people and we shared three apps, although two would have probably been enough. The poutine was a table favourite by far, and a clear highlight of the meal. The fries were crispy, the meat was tender, and the sauce was flawlessly seasoned. The shrimp was also very tasty - they had great flavour with just a hint of spice, and were a perfect fit for the gastropub theme. The naanchos were okay, but we wouldn't order them again. The chips were too thick and bland, despite the interesting toppings. Sounds like a good dish, but really nothing special. I'd say skip the latter, and just try out the poutine and shrimp.  For entrees we individually ordered the Lamb Roganjosh, Daily Fish, and Lamb Seekh Kebab. The roganjosh was a personal favourite of mine - well spiced, well cooked, well made. Though it was more traditional and didn't exactly fit the gastropub element, I would highly recommend it. It did come with a small mountain of rice that probably could have been halved, but hey. I'd rather have too much food than too little. The fish was fresh, flavourful, and light. If this is a trend with their daily dishes, I'm impressed. The kebab was the most original of all the dishes, perhaps, as it was cooked and dressed Indian-style but served like a ballpark dog. Though I found it to be a touch dry, the person who ordered it was a fan. To each their own, I suppose.  For a side we all shared the Macaroni Makhani - better known as the butter chicken mac and cheese. It was tasty, original and delicious, certainly, but VERY rich. With all our dishes it was too much for any of us to take more than a few bites of, and we ended up bringing it home.  My only overarching complaint would be that all of the food was quite heavy and lacking in vegetables. More side salads, veggie options, or light dishes would be greatly appreciated, as we all went home positively stuffed to the brim.   Though, the delicious food was surely worth it. :)"}
{"text":"Ji is the sister restaurant to Pukka, which is just a few minutes walk away from each other. The only difference is the Ji is more of a pub that serves indian-inspired fare, than an actual indian restaurant. Don't let that get in the way of deterring you from a visit though, because the food at Ji is delicious.  Notable dishes for me were the butter chicken mac-and-cheese, which was very comfortable and very yummy. The fish curry (though not everyone's taste) also stood out for me - the fish done just right and was not dry, and the curry it was served in was perfect with the lemon scented rice.  I do feel that Ji could benefit from lowering their prices a dollar or two off their dishes and expand their drinks/beer selection. Having that said, I would not hesitate to eat at Ji again."}
{"text":"A must try in Toronto: Butter Chicken Mac n Cheese !! New Restaurant @hellojitoronto on St.Clair Ave W serves this delicious cheesey baked pasta. If you are a fan of pasta or mac n cheese, this has your name written all over it!  Attended a dinner at @hellojitoronto which offers Indian/Canadian comfort food. Chef Kirti Singh has combined ordinary pub comfort food with eclectic Indian flavour.  Harsh Chawla and Derek Valleau are the same owners from @pukkatoronto and bring you the same quality of cuisine combined with your favourite comfort food.  Tried quite a few things on the menu: Butter chicken mac n cheese, naanchos topped with lamb keema & raita cheddar, brisket poutine with masala fries paneer and pulled beef curry! All highly recommended to order when you visit Ji"}
{"text":"I've come to Ji three times and every time is absolutely delicious. Service is top notch and they have managers walk around as well to ensure that everyone is enjoying themselves which is something I always appreciate.   All I would ask is for you to bring back the creamy slaw you did as a side to the veggie burgers!! The new slaw is no where near as tasty! :)  Must try: banana cream pie, naanchos, vegan caesar and my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE the Navratan Korma"}
