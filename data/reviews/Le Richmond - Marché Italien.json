{"text":"food arrived cold. was either cooked too early or reheated. Service has a lot to improve.   Ladies: if you decide to wear heels when going to this place, I suggest you DON'T. Steel floor between the entrance to the second door in both the restaurant and the marche has small undetectable, movable holes and unless you've been to the place before your heel will most likely get stuck in it. My $1200 Louboutin did. Both feet. Such a deadly trap.   One should always do some research before trying new restaurant nowadays. If the restaurant is often busy, no need to participate in the Mtl A Table."}
{"text":"A very nice place where you can have an italian coffee, grab a bite and enjoy some design items.  I went there today for an afternoon coffee and desert. End up buying some italian specialities like their famous italian sausage, pasta and their amazing pomodoro sauce. A nice variety of desert made by their chef pastry.  At 5pm you can enjoy their 5 a 7. They also have a nice bar.  I can recommend this place to take your mother, best friend and even your chum."}
{"text":"I love it! Food is fresh and delicious- I've been several times and had an amazing lasagna, delicious salads and soup. The deserts are also great. And you can grab some gourmet groceries while at it!"}
{"text":"Lovely place, the lady at the cash helped me pick from the take out counter and gave me a tour of their terroir products. Hands down the best honey I've had (raw honey from Montreal). I frequently go grab takeout salads and lasagnas when I don't feel like cooking, tastes home made and always fresh."}
{"text":"Lovely European environment, delicious food, professional staff, and an overall happening spot for a Saturday/Sunday afternoon. Paris meets NYC in Montreal... Lovely selection of pastries, beverages, and household goods like soaps, candles, and a lot more to take home."}
{"text":"Excited to have found this hidden gem of a spot in Montreal. Definite regular brunch spot. Service speed could use a tweak. Good coffee, friendly service, great food."}
{"text":"Pas emballé.  L'endroit est calé et stylé, un bel espace où on retrouve des tables pour se poser, des étagères avec pleins de supers produits et un emplacement central avec des plats à emporter. On peut réserver pour les brunchs et ca c'est cool. Bon le service a été plus que laborieux au niveau du temps de service. C'était vraiment long mais après l'avoir fait remarqué à la serveuse elle nous a gentillement apporté des pâtisseries à partager pour nous faire patienter. Joli geste :) Au niveau de l'uf bénédictine que j'ai pris c'était pas le meilleur que j'ai pris. Ils étaient servis sur une baguette, je suis pas un extrémiste du muffin anglais mais ils auraient au moins pu mettre les ufs sur le pain afin que lorsque tu coupes l'uf le jaune imbibe le pain. La panchetta servis était assez maigre en terme de quantité. Les patates rissolés étaient bonne et mention particulière pour la mini assiette de fruit vraiment bonne. J'ai pris un thé glacé à la canneberge et c'était succulent.  Au final - déception sur le plat, l'attente, le prix (27$ pour des oeufs pas fou et un verre de thé glacé je trouve ca chéros ...) - bien pour le cadre  Je laisse ma place pour une prochaine fois :)"}
{"text":"You would expect a restaurant to maybe give a damn about what people think.  I sent an email to them, right after posting my review.  If you are interested in getting/keeping customers, you might consider replying to an email, with an explanation, and apology... anything.  Shows me you think a lot of yourselves, that you don't need to worry about an individual client.    Considering the restaurant was empty on a saturday night, I might reconsider that position."}
{"text":"I am not sure about this place. it Half market, half restaurant. The market got some cute items, not sure who would go there shopping though. The restaurant is nice, the decor has a trendy and modern look to it but they failed at insulating their windows. Bring a sweater or you are going to be wearing your coat if you sit next to the window. The service was very slow but the waitress was super nice. The food is overpriced and underwhelming. I think I just talked myself into never going back there."}
{"text":"The three of us came here for dinner on a Friday evening recently. It was quiet, unlike their sister restaurant Le Richmond which is just next door. Perhaps not many people know that in that fancy European delicatessen looking place sits a lovely, industrial chic Italian bistro with to-die-for lighting fixtures. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and honest. And then came the food. Oh how it was good and generous! My mushroom pizza was exquisite, while my friends' osso bucco was darn pretty to look at (in addition to being delicious). We also tried their gnocchi, which tasted nothing like supermarket gnocchi - a very good sign. Lastly, the cannoli tasted like it was individually made with love. All these at very reasonable prices. Definitely a keeper!"}
{"text":"It is the best place to go for a coffee or grab a quick bit or even sit for a meal. They also have a wide variety of sandwiches, salades and yummy pastry.  The industrial design gives an air of elegance to that Italian grocery store. Actually, when you enter the place, you do not get the feeling of entering a grocery store.  It is a combination of restaurant, cafe trottoir italien and grocery.   I went there on a Sunday afternoon for a coffee. The place is very nice and cozy.   They have a wide variety of food products in their grocery section. Big variety of cheese, sausages, ham & meat. They also have a wine cellar. You can also find olive oil and tea. Most of their products are high end.  I look forward to going again to Marche Italien le Richmond."}
